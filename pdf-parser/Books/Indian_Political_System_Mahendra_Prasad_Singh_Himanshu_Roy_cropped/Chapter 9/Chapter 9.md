# **Federalism: Constitution and Dynamics**

*Mahendra Prasad Singh*

# ❑❑ **Parliamentary Federalism**

Even if this argument is accepted that the parliamentary-federal system established under the 1950 Indian constitution is in many ways not only a unique federal union in contemporary comparative politics, but also the one uniquely suited to the Indian conditions,<sup>1</sup> we cannot wish away the fact that India in the 1980s and 1990s has been faced with an overwhelming challenge of federalizing its predominantly parliamentary system. Working a pure parliamentary system (e.g., United Kingdom) is difficult enough. But the problems are compounded manifold when the system combines the parliamentary principle of government with the federal one, and seeks to transplant it in a post-colonial nation. Even though, neither the ideas of federalism and republicanism<sup>2</sup> nor those of nominal monarchy and effective premiership<sup>3</sup> are alien to Indian history, India owes substantially to the modern West for its contemporary experiments with parliamentary federalism. For reasons not far to seek, both the British colonial rulers and the emergent nationalist elites who inherited power from them contrived constitutions that created a system of parliamentary paramountcy with a limited federal component. The British, due to the compulsions of colonial administrative centralization, and the nationalists, on account of the fissiparous tendencies prevalent through the Indian history and due to the trauma of religious communal frenzy and the partition of the country did it. Sure enough, in the last days of their rule, the British offered a scheme of loose confederation in the Cabinet Mission Plan as a sequel to the Simon Commission Report. But it fell on the hard rock of intransigence between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League. And earlier, the federal components of the Government of India Act, 1935, had remained a dead letter for the refusal of the princely rulers of the native Indian States to join hands with the nationalists in working the new constitution. The Congress itself turned back to the promise of a loose federal union in its 1946 election manifesto. It outlined the objective of centralized federal union in the Constituent Assembly when it became evident that partition was inevitable.<sup>4</sup>

Thus, despite its great cultural and regional diversities and historical patterns of disunity, indeed, in a very real sense, because of it, in 1950 India adopted a heavily centralized system of parliamentary federalism under the dual impacts of the British colonial and nationalist interventions.

The constitution established an "amicable union" combining parliamentary federal features. In many ways, it is a unique federal constitution in comparative federalism. It ensures Union's legislative supremacy not on the Union List, but also on the Concurrent List and residuary legislative jurisdiction; even on the State List the Union Parliament can legislate in specified and exceptional circumstances. The Union executive power overrides State executive power outside the area of exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the States. The constitution ensures Union Parliament's supremacy and initiative in taxation, in constitutionally anticipated emergencies, in all-India civil and police services (which are recruited and trained by the Union government, and then allocated to the State governments), in judicial administration, and in constitutional amendments. Even the very existence of a State is contingent on the will of the Parliament which enjoys overriding powers with regard to redrawing the map of India and reorganization of State boundaries. However, it is evident from the reorganization of States over the years that the formal parliamentary power, in this regard, had been subject to the powerful mass movements for the creation of unilingual States much against the will of the Central government. Moreover, since the constitution went into effect, there has been a further expansion of the powers and functions of the Central government. For example, the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act (1951) expanded the power of the Central government under Entry 52 of the Union List to a number of industries (included in Schedule I) limiting or overlapping the power of State governments over industries under Entry 24 of the State List. Entries to Schedule I are indeed further extendable by Union executive order.<sup>5</sup> However, barring constitutional emergencies, the Union and State governments in their respective jurisdictions coordinate, which is what federalism essentially means. And, with the growing diversification and regionalization of the party system, Centre's interventions in State governments is becoming less viable and more restrained. Moreover, of late, especially since 1989, State governors are beginning to show some signs of independence as "federal" rather than just being Centre's agent.<sup>7</sup>

# **The Dynamics of Causation**

This paper analyses the impact on India's parliamentary-federal system of the following seven factors in the past 42 years of its working: (1) styles of Prime Ministerial leadership, (2) judicial and moral authority and structures, (3) party system, (4) regional disparities, (5) ethnic identities, (6) class formation in the emerging structures of the mixed capitalist and State capitalist economy, and (7) economic planning and centrally sponsored schemes of development. Needless to say, like all variables in social sciences, the foregoing, too, are partly overlapping and enmeshed, but their independent casual effects are analytically amenable to delineation.

Among the constitutional-political and public-policy variables, the Prime Ministerial leadership style has been a factor of greater salience in India than in some other political systems that combined the parliamentary and federal systems (e.g., Canada in 1867 and Australia in 1901). Even similar party systems, in terms of the structure of electoral competition, have produced a different political dynamics under varying premiership styles. For example, the party systems under Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi were structurally both one-party dominant systems. However, the former was more pluralistically structured while the latter was heavily personalized and centralized. Of the socio-economic factors, especially regional disparities and ethnic and class identities, these had been less salient than the political variables to begin with, but they have been becoming factors to gathering momentum over the years. Combined with regionalism, ethnic and class factors mounted a great deal of institutional and mass pressures in favour of further federalization with an increased degree of State autonomy in the 1980s. States' autonomy demands and movements multiplied. While most of the earlier mass movements related to the Sates in the 1950s and 1960s were for linguistic reorganization of State boundaries, movements over the 1970s and 1980s veered around the issues of constitutional restructuring to provide greater powers and revenue resources for the States. By the late 1980s, some of these movements took a turn for religious fundamentalism and secessionism. The Sikh fundamentalists in Punjab, Muslim fundamentalists in Jammu & Kashmir, and linguistic ethnics in Assam came to rule the roost in these States, virtually paralyzing the democratic process. Forces of secessionism were neither new in Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir nor were they absent in some other States (e.g., Madras/Tamil Nadu, some Northeastern states) earlier. However, over the 1960s and 1970s, the dominant regional parties in these States had turned their back on secessionism and joined the national mainstream. The 1980s witnessed, two parallel developments, both mounting tremendous pressures towards federalization. With the number of non-Congress state governments increasing over the decade, chief ministers of these States held conclaves in Vijayawada, Bangalore, Calcutta, and Srinagar, demonstrating an impressive orchestration not only of the all-India parties, like Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Janata Party, but also of regional parties, like Telugu Desam, National Conference, and Akali Dal. (Such a conclave of Bharatiya Janata Party CMs also took place in the early 1990s.) Besides, regional mass movements in states, like Punjab, Kashmir, and Assam in the late 1980s came to be captured by fundamentalists and secessionists to the discomfiture and ambivalence of the dominant regional parties in these States, i.e., Akali Dal, National Conference, and Assam Gana Parishad.

# **Premiership Styles**

The evolution of premiership styles has yielded at least three major models: (1) Parliamentary, (2) Patrimonial, and (3) Federal. Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, and Indira Gandhi (until the 1969 Congress split) displayed a premiership style that may be termed Parliamentary. The parameters of this political framework were defined by a more or less collective leadership among the stalwarts in the cabinet even though the Prime Minister clearly towered over them, autonomous set of Chief Ministers, especially in the rimland states, and a clientelist pattern of voting behaviour under the tutelage of dominant caste and community leaders. However, the Congress party ruled at the Centre as well as in overwhelmingly large number of states. And the Prime Ministers were widely popular leaders having participated in the national liberation movement or being members of the Nehru dynasty or closely associated with it. The dominant Congress party, with its inheritance of the mass nationalist movements against the British Raj, was itself the New Raj, but it held regular organizational elections at various levels and annual All India Congress Committee conferences. So, even though the federal tensions were often exacerbated, the system of one-party dominance worked essentially within the parliamentary framework.

With Indira Gandhi's rise to undisputed leadership in the Congress party and the country after the 1969 Congress split with her right-wing senior colleagues and the 1971 Lok Sabha and 1972 State Assembly elections, a new premiership style came into being, even though the structure of competition among parties formally continued to be a one-party dominant one. A series of changes followed. The area of collective cabinet leadership tended to narrow and eventually zeroed in on the Prime Minister. The patron-client network of voting behaviour at the level tended to erode under the twin pressures of competition among political elites and social mobilization and politicization at the mass level. Challenged by the Syndicate faction within her party, Indira Gandhi bypassed the intermediary structures of power within the party and State governments and made a direct personalized mass appeal to the electorate through the government-controlled electronic mass media, bureaucratic apparatus, and a handpicked pack of party bodies that passed as party organizations. Central interventions in State governments under Article 356 of the constitution providing for "President's rule" and legislations through presidential ordinances multiplied manifold (Table 1). The executive backed by a docile parliamentary majority and with some regional and Communist parties' support, sought to ride rough shod over the judiciary. A powerful mass movement led by the non-Congress and non-Communist opposition parties gathered momentum. The intelligentsia

Table 1 President's Rule in States and Presidential Ordinances (1950-91)\*

*Notes:* President's rule was promulgated in Jammu and Kashmir in 1986 following the expiry of six months of Governor's rule under Section 92 of the constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. Similarly, in 1990, again in the same State President's rule followed the expiry of six months of Governor's rule. President's rule in Punjab declared in May 1987 was extended several times almost for four years necessitating a constitutional amendment for this purpose. It was finally revoked after the controversial Assembly elections in the State in February 1992.

in the press and the universities also grew critical. Faced with these pressures mounted by the federal and judicial organs of the State, the press, and the extra-parliamentary mass movements, the executive reacted by authoritarian constitutional amendments concentrating power into the office of the PM, proclamation of a national emergency under Article 352 of the constitution, and large-scale arrests of the opposition leaders. With all these developments, the federal features of the political system, limited even at the best of times, came to be seriously whittled down. Indeed, even the Parliamentary features were seriously eroded by an excessively centralizing drive on the part of the Prime Minister. It is for these reasons that this phase of Indira Gandhi's premiership is best described as patrimonial one.'<sup>8</sup>

After her defeat in the 1977 Lok Sabha elections and her electoral restoration in the 1980 mid-term polls, Indira Gandhi was a bit chastened. But her imperious style, reinforced by her augmented international prestige, continued by and large. Rajiv Gandhi, who succeeded her after her brutal assassination in October 1984 and won by an electoral landslide the same year, was a breeze of fresh air. He was less inclined to topple non-Congress State governments. He also showed a greater respect for the judiciary and the press. He entered into a series of formal and informal accords with dominant regional parties in Punjab, Assam, Mizoram, Tripura, and Jammu and Kashmir and continued his mother's informal understanding with the All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) in Tamil Nadu.

However, before he could seriously execute his promised reforms in the Congress party aimed at weeding out the corrupt "middlemen" and holding organizational elections, he was himself caught up halfway through his mandate in the alleged kickbacks in the defence purchase deals with the Swedish firm Bofors (his personal involvement remains as yet unestablished in the inconclusive probes). Moreover, Punjab Accord remained unimplemented due to political and judicial intractability. Besides, Punjab, Kashmir, and Assam were overtaken by the spreading dragnet of terrorism and secessionism. And, finally, Rajiv Gandhi lost in the 1989 Lok Sabha elections and, after a brief but impressive spell as the leader of the opposition in the Parliament, was brutally assassinated in a terrorist bomb blast by suspected Sri Lankan Tamil terrorists in Sriperambudur in Tamil Nadu in the run-up to the midterm polls in May 1991.

The federal Prime Ministerial style of leadership was presaged by the Janata phase (1977-79) and carne into a fuller play after the 1989 Lok Sabha elections and the elections in 1991, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2004, and 2009. The Prime Minister's now have to contend with not only a multi-party system at the Centre, but also with some powerful regional and all-India parties, other than the one in power at the Centre, ruling the roost in some States.

# **Judicial and Moral Authority Structures**

Federal systems are especially hungry for judicial and moral interventions in the political process to rescue them from the mire of illegitimacy and excessive partisan conflicts and coercion. The judiciary and the Presidency are the two obvious candidates for such a role in the Indian political system: one, the repository of condensed judicial authority, the other, endowed with a great moral authority in the federal domain by virtue of his federal electoral college and the expectations of the framers of the constitution about his non-partisan role in a strictly Parliamentary (i.e., nominally constitutional) framework. Despite Presidents Rajendra Prasad's and Zail Singh' pleas or threats to the contrary,<sup>9</sup>all the incumbents so far have stayed put in the parameters of a constitutional Presidency. Indeed, the Parliamentary system normally precludes an activist or interventionist conception of the Presidency beyond the pale of moral persuasion and sagely advice. In India's institutional parameters of a parliamentary-federal system, the ultimate moral and judicial sanction rests with the Supreme Court, which under Article 131 of the constitution enjoys exclusive original *legal* jurisdiction in all federal and inter-state disputes, and under Article 143 an *advisory* 

jurisdiction on any "question of law or fact" of "public importance" referred to it by the President.<sup>10</sup>

Federal nature of the Indian constitution is a major source, among others, of the judicial review not only of laws but also of constitutional amendments enacted by the Parliament and State legislatures. Judicial review, in turn, has also significantly impacted the dynamics of the Indian federal system. Neither the constitution nor the conflicts between the Parliament and judiciary for supremacy have established in India a system which is identical with the system of parliamentary sovereignty (any other source of law and constitution is subordinate) as in Great Britain or with the system of judicial supremacy ("the constitution is what the judges say it is") in the United States. One may perhaps venture to say that India has established a system of constitutional supremacy. For within the constitutional text itself, there are express limitations placed on the power of the Parliament and that of judicial review.<sup>11</sup>The parliament and the Supreme Court 'each enjoy considerable, say, on where the constitution really stands and what it actually means.' The Supreme Court first sought to extend its power of judicial review of legislations under Article 13 to constitutional amendments in Part III of the constitution on Fundamental Rights by declaring them unamendable (*Golak Nath vs. State of Punjab,* 1967). The Parliament reacted by inserting an additional clause into Article 13 by the constitution (24th Amendment) Act, 1971, Section 2: "Nothing in this article shall apply to any amendment of this constitution made under Article 368". The judiciary in its judgement in *Keshavanada Bharti vs. State of Kerala* (1973) conceded that the Parliament can amend any part of the constitution, but it bounced back to entrench the constitution by qualifying that in doing so the Parliament cannot alter its "basic structure" or "essential features". Its power of judicial review was reiterated by the Supreme Court in the *Minerva Mills vs. Union of India* (1980).<sup>12</sup>This is inevitable in a written constitution with federal division of powers, Fundamental Rights, and federally shared amending process.

It is interesting to observe that the ebb and flow of parliamentary and judicial power have varied with the changing nature of the party system. Periods of one-party dominance have seen the judiciary, generally, acquiesce in and accommodate the socio-economic reforms and constitutional amendments enacted by the Parliament (e.g., the Nehru era). Or else, such periods of one-party dominance under a more populist and centralizing Prime Minister have seen the Parliament seeking to clip the wings of the judiciary, with the latter retreating from its contention that Part III of the constitution on Fundamental Rights is beyond the pale of the amending power of the Parliament, yet holding tenaciously to the doctrine of the unamendability of the "basic structure" or "essential features" of the constitution. The *Golak Nath* judgement came in the year of the Fourth General Elections which witnessed the first major breach in the system of one-party dominance. The inherent unity in diversity of the Indian society, the current

#### **152** ✽ CHAPTER 8

multi-party system of polarized pluralism, and the tremendous pressures for federalizing the predominantly parliamentary system are likely to enhance the federal relevance of the judicial organ of the state. But excessive reliance on the judiciary for settlement of *political* disputes and its consequential politicization would reduce its judicial relevance and efficacy.

# **Party Systems**

There is also a significant factor in the nature of the party system, which has been in transition. One such transition was from the one-party dominant system to the two-party system in 1977, when only two parties, Janata and Congress, accounted for above 80 per cent of both votes and seats. For a brief period in the wake of the 1969 Congress split, the minority Congress government of Indira Gandhi had survived with the support of CPI and some regional parties, but the hangover of the Congress predominance was too recent and breach in it too short to give rise to a federal premiership style. During the Janata Dal phase, even though this party came to power simultaneously in New Delhi and some major and smaller North Indian States, factionalism among the five constituent parties that had merged to form it had an added federal dimension to it, as the two major constituents, the Bharatiya Lok Dal and Bharatiya Jana Sangh, divided among themselves the States ruled by the Janata Party. Besides, the Congress continued to control Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in the South, and so did the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu, and the Left Front to West Bengal.

The post-1989 party system became a multi-party system; in Giovanni Sartori's terms, a system of "polarized pluralism".<sup>13</sup> Two governments followed in quick succession in the Ninth Lok Sabha. The National Front government was a minority coalition government of the Janata Dal, Congress (Socialist), Telugu Desam, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), and Asom Gana Parishad and supported, without joining government, by the Communist Parties and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Its successor Janata Dal (Socialist) minority government was supported from outside the government by the Congress party. Following the mid-term polls in 1991, the Congress formed a minority government led by the veteran P.V. Narasimha Rao that somehow completed its mandate of five years. The Prime Minister had to contend not only with an issue-based support from the BJP and National Front-Left parties alliance, but also had to make a tight-rope-walk in the context of the most diverse set of State governments formed by Congress and non-Congress parties since Independence. All these developments obviously put a high premium on a federal style Prime Ministerial leadership. In subsequent elections in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2004 coalition/ minority government led by Janata Dal, BJP or Congress were formed continuing to demand federal premiership style of leadership.

To sum up, the trajectory of party system evolution has passed through at least six stages: (1) Predominant Party System-I (1952-69); (2) Multi-party System-I (1969-71); (3) Predominant Party System-II (1971-77); (4) Two-Party System (1977-84); (5) (a stillborn) Predominant Party System-III (1984-1989); and (6) Multi-party System-II (1989-todate).<sup>14</sup> The transition from one–party dominance to a more competitive, pluralist party system has been a factor contributing to the greater federalization of India's predominantly parliamentary system.

# **Regional Disparities**

In addition to being a political arrangement for democratic governance of societies marked by unity in diversities, federalism is also an economic mechanism for reduction of regional disparities by federal financial transfer and reallocation of resources. Indian States are divisible into six major categories of economic development measured by per capita income, with Punjab at the top (`1586) and Bihar at the bottom (`645). The national average happens to be `874, and the averages for Groups A, B, C, D, E and F States stand at `1445, `1071, `939, `812, `712, and `262, respectively, as per the *Report of the Finance Commission, 1978*. <sup>15</sup> Such sharp regional disparities have led the States not only to take divergent positions on the criteria for federal fiscal transfers but also more lately for a new constitutional reallocation of powers and revenue resources between the Centre and the States. For example, the criteria for the distribution of income tax between the two levels of government and among the States have been highly contentious. More industrialized States, like Maharashtra and West Bengal have advocated for a greater weightage for the criterion of the place of collection of the tax, while poorer and more populous states have emphasized population as the major criteria. Neither is foolproof. In case of a large business enterprise, income earned in a number of States is usually declared in the metropolitan city where its head office is located. On the other hand, population may not always be a valid indicator of the financial needs of a State. A less populous State, like vast but arid Rajasthan may, at times, require larger revenue for development than a more populous one.<sup>16</sup> Moreover, some states endowed with rich mineral resources, but, otherwise, poor have been agitated over lower royalties for their minerals and inadequate share in the industrial exploitation of their resources (e.g., Assam and Bihar). Similarly, agriculturally rich States have been uptight about Food Zones restricting movement of grain across the nation freely and the pricing mechanism for the agricultural sector.

By and large, there have been three channels for federal financial transfers to States: (1) assured fiscal devolution from the divisible pool of taxes and duties on recommendations of the Finance Commission under Article 275 of the constitution; (2) discretionary plan assistance (loans and grants) from the Centre to the States recommended by the Finance Commission (under Article 282) and by the Planning Commission; and (3) discretionary grants to the States for Centrally-sponsored projects of development and administration under the Planning Commission dispensation. There has been a growing trend over the years for a larger proportion of federal transfers to be made through the Finance Commission than through the Planning Commission. For example, where 24.4 per cent of resources in the Third–Five Year Plan were transferred through the Finance Commission, 48.9 per cent through the Planning Commission, and 22.7 per cent through other means; the respective figures in the Sixth Plan period stood at 61.1 per cent, 38.9 per cent, and 14.6 per cent. The pattern of change is consistent across the various plans.<sup>17</sup>

Finance Commissions have evolved approaches, with some variations, for devolution of taxes divisible between the Centre and States and grantsin-aid by the former to the latter in which the population of States loomed large among the criteria for tax revenue devolution (80 per cent for income tax in the Fifth Finance Commission Report) and revenue-expenditure gap and special problems of the States for grants-in-aid. The Ninth Finance Commission, in its first Report for 1989-90, recommended a modified Gadgil formula, whereby income tax and union excise duties may be distributed among States in accordance with this ratio: (1) 20 per cent on the basis of population; (2) 50 per cent on the basis of distance of the per capita income of a State from the highest per capita income State multiplied by its population; (3) 12.5 per cent on the basis of a State's per capita income multiplied by its population; and (4) 12.5 per cent on the proportion of poor people in the State to the total poor population nationally.<sup>18</sup>

However, in the formula for Central assistance to the States recommended by the Planning Commission and approved by the National Development Council in December 1991, population continues to be given more weightage, alongside, of course, some other criteria: population (60 per cent), per capita income (25 per cent), and performance (7.5 per cent). Moreover, of the 25 per cent weightage given to per capita income was made to conform to the "deviation method" such that higher the allocation of Central assistance, lower the per capita income of a State than the national average.<sup>19</sup>

## **Ethnic Identities and Class Formation**

To take the tack of ethnic identities and class formation, it is only natural that modern class formation in a country of India's size and diversity is marked by sharp regional variations and pre-capitalist residues. The classes of capitalists, middle class professionals, and industrial workers have been more prone to form national federations than the farmers, peasants, and agricultural workers. But, all these class organizations have been marked by factionalism along regional and party lines. Trade unions have been especially susceptible to "colonization" by political parties and inter-union rivalries. In the short run, primordial or ethnic identities bedevil class interests and organizations. Moreover, there have been dominant regional parties thriving on linguistic and religious identities in some States, besides some national or all-India parties predominantly based on religious and caste identities.

Three recent developments are particularly noticeable in this context. One refers to the rise by the mid-1960s of a prosperous peasantry, predominantly comprising the "Other Backward Castes" (GBCs so-called to distinguish them from the Scheduled Castes/Tribes). Economically, they happen to be the major beneficiaries of the post-Independence land reforms and the green revolution. Socially and educationally, they have made some advance, but their representation in government employment, universities, and the press is still disproportionate to their size. This gave rise to the controversies and agitations around the New Reservation Policies of the National Front and the Narasimha Rao Congress government. Politically, they emerged as a dominant group in the Janata Party/Janata Dal, especially its Bharatiya Lok Dal/Dalit Mazdoor Kisan Party/Lok Dal constituents and splinters. The taste of political power in periods of Janata ascendancy only whetted their political appetite, but Janata Dal has become splintered into Samajvadi Party (U.P.), Rashtriya Janata Dal (Bihar), Biju Janata Dal (Orissa), Janata Dal (Secular) (Karnataka), and Janata Dal (United) with Samata Party elements in Bihar as the nucleus.

The second development, in this connection, is the rise of the regional bourgeoisie and professional middle classes. These classes, often in collaboration with the peasants and farmers brought about by the late 1970s and early 1980s far-reaching electoral realignments in some States displacing the Indian National Congress by some regional parties, otherwise, not very different from the Congress sociologically and ideologically, except for OBC and regional biases, e.g., Telugu Desam in Andhra Pradesh, Asom Gana Parishad in Assam, Janata Party/Dal in Bihar, U.P., Haryana, Karnataka, etc.

The third development is the emergence of Hindu revivalism in the late 1980s under the aegis of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, and Bharatiya Janata Party in several States, especially in the Hindi belt. Riding on this revivalist wave, the BJP came to power, off and on, in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra (in coalition with Shiv Sena), and Gujarat. Initially, a party of urban Hindu refugees from Pakistan and traditional middle class urban Hindus, the BJP in recent years has extended its support-base to rural areas as well.

All these features and factors have significantly affected the patterns of federal politics. For one thing, the gradual growth of separate class and ethnic political mobilization put the multi-class, multi-ethnic, catch-all strategy of political mobilization under severe strain. The decline of one-party dominant system allowed a freer play to the federal forces of the polity. For another thing, it was not only the parliamentary party system that was increasingly federalized, but also the States component of the party system came to be diversified with a large assortment of non-Congress parties forming governments in a sizeable number of States. The electoral support of these non-Congress regional and all-India parties is strongly associated with: (1) areas of agrarian and industrial modernization, and (2) communal and caste mobilization by these parties. Though the Congress still remains the largest and most widely spread national party, seeking to simultaneously appeal through its policies to the bourgeoisie, the middle classes, the workers, and the poor in urban and rural areas. It also seeks to address to all regions of the country across the board. In the long-run and in the final crunch, it may settle down to be a party of the bourgeoisie and the middle classes and still manage to garner a sizeable measure of electoral support if and when the hold of communal, caste, and regional parties on the middle classes and the regional bourgeoisie declines. The other two enduring party formations may be a party of peasant proprietors and of the communists supported by industrial and agricultural workers.

# **Strategy of Economic Development**

The relationship between the strategy of economic development adopted in India and federalism is, generally, not yet fully appreciated. But, it is plausible to argue that the structure of mixed economy (consisting of a dominant Public/State sector and a Private sector) and a state-led strategy of industrialization have had a centralizing impact on the federal system during the Nehru and Indira Gandhi premierships up at least until the mid-1970s. Due to political and economic pressures, both the Nehruvian model of economic development and the gloss of political centralization put on it by Indira Gandhi was challenged during the Janata phase (1977-79). The return of Indira Gandhi in 1980 and the succession of Rajiv Gandhi in 1984 did not mean a return to pre-1977 conditions. Both initiated policies of liberalizing the heavily regulated economic regimes of the Nehru and the first Indira Gandhi eras. And, after the uncertainties of two minority governments between the 1989 Lok Sabha elections and the 1991 mid-term polls, the Narasimha Rao government greatly accelerated the pace of economic liberalization. Reorientation in economic policies was not without its impact on federal dynamics in the 1980s, even though the ushering in of a multiparty system in 1989 has initially been a factor of greater moment. However, the contradiction between a centralized federal polity and the new economic reforms has been perceptively brought out by Amal Ray:

"If the objective of the new reforms is to enhance competitiveness of the Indian economy and so its efficiency, then this precludes the concentration of governmental power at one level or private power in a few monopoly houses. The ethos of competition has to be enforced through economic as well as political behaviour. And competition would require the maintenance of certain protected powers for the respective partners and, therefore, a certain dualism in the federal system."<sup>20</sup>

# **Economic Planning and Centrally-sponsored Development Schemes**

In classical federal thought and institutional design and practice, planning was either unanticipated or considered antithetical to federalism. In modern Indian political thought and policy formulation, however, planning was considered as essential strategy for national economic growth and industrialization under the aegis of the independent Indian nation-state. Early on after independence, a Planning Commission was set up by a decision of the Central government, a practice that came to be emulated by the State governments that followed suit by establishing similar commissions or boards that came to work in tandem. Similarly, a non-statutory body developed in the National Development Council to facilitate final political consultations between the Union government and State Chief Ministers on the plan document. This exercise in "economic federalism" in itself may not have led to excessive centralization. But financial superiority of the Centre, coupled with the State governments' reluctance to tax the farm sector for obvious political reasons, led to the unfolding of Centrally-sponsored schemes of economic development jointly administered by the Central and State governments. Central financing and guidelines for and monitoring of these schemes, implemented mainly through State governments, have resulted in an enormous increase in the activities, powers, and influence of the Central government not only in areas of concurrent, but also exclusively State subjects. This is not only unique to India; this trend of "cooperative federalism" has been observed in other federal systems as well. In the USA, in the 1980s the "New Federalism" of President Ronald Reagan initiated the process of reversing this trend by transferring responsibilities and funds to the State governments.

In more recent years, the Centre has been transferring the Centrallysponsored schemes to the States on the plea of lack of funds. But it has to initially continue to finance them because the States say they do not have funds either. Thus, at the 43rd meeting of the National Development Council in December 1991, it was decided that 113 such schemes, as recommended by the Narasimha Rao Committee, would be transferred to the States with the existing mode of their financing.<sup>21</sup> The future of such schemes would appear to be bleak because of current financial crunch and the new, more conservative economic policies stepped up since 1991 by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao and Finance Minister Manmohan Singh and more or less continued by successive governments of India, at varying faces without change of direction.

#### **Territorial Convolution**

An interesting dimension of federalization in India concerns territorial and cultural matrices of India's sub-continental polity: Indian history is replete with a constant interplay between the imperial and regional centres of power. During the British Raj, the colonial State first consolidated a centralized Viceregal system incorporating the British Indian provinces under its direct rule and the princely/native Indian States under their paramountcy. It subsequently started the processes of devolution of power: and federalization in stages. So, when the 1950 constitution established a centralized federal Union, it was not an instance of independent States federating, but one of the virtually unitary State decentralizing itself. The "territorial federalism" in India does not only have the pressure of size to federalize (as in Australia), but also the additional components of language, religion, and tribe. The linguistic basis for the organization of the Indian National Congress in disregard of the then existing multilingual State boundaries was accepted by its leadership as early as the beginning of the Gandhian era in the 1920s. Besides, regional movements in the Bengal Presidency led to the carving out of the provinces of Bihar (Hindi-speaking) and Orissa (Oriya-speaking in 1912 and the bifurcation of the latter in 1936. With the lapse of paramountcy of the British Crown over the native Indian States in 1947, the Government of India combined diplomacy and "police action" to effectuate the integration of these States with the newly created Indian Union. The constitution of India first created several categories of States to take into account the variety and complexity of units, thus, amalgamate (but subsequently reduced them into "States" (28) and "Union Territories." (7). Shortly after Independence in 1947, movements for linguistic reorganization of States appeared in several States. The National Congress leadership as well as the States Reorganization Commission Report (1956) preferred the maintenance of multi-lingual; States for cultural homogenization. However, under the pressure and persistence of linguistic, religious, and tribal movements the Central government yielded, creating the States of Andhra Pradesh (Telugu-speaking), Tamil Nadu (Tamil-speaking Karnataka (Kannada-speaking), Gujarat (Gujarati-speaking), Maharashtra (Marathispeaking), Punjab (Punjabi-speaking with a Sikh-majority), Haryana (Hindispeaking), Himachal Pradesh (Hindi-speaking), all in the 1950s and 1960s. This process of territorial reorganization extended to the North-East in the 1970s, culminating the emergence of the so-called "seven sisters" States and Union Territories in the North-East. In the 1980s, sub-regional movements based tribal or ethnic identities, acquired salience in several states. Such movements includes Gorkha National Liberation Front in the Darjeeling hill district of West Bengal, Bodoland agitation in Assam, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha in the Chhotanagpur region in South Bihar, and some other tribal areas in the adjoining states including West Bengal, Orissa, and Madhya Pradesh.To meet these sub-regional demands, a new federal innovation of an autonomous Regional Development Council has been made in Darjeeling and Bodoland. Earlier, when the Telangana sub-regional agitation in Andhra Pradesh was at its peak in the 1970s, this device was first introduced there with good results. Since then, the idea also gained ground in Vidrabha and Ladakh regions in Maharashtra and Jammu and Kashmir. In addition, a new experiment in federal convolution has been made in the North-East, where several States until recently had a common Governor and there still is an inter-state development council, named, North-Eastern Council (NEC).

Moreover, inter-state disputes have been flaring up around almost all rivers that flow through more than one State. Such disputes over Satluj and Cauvery rivers have recently soured relations between Punjab and Haryana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and involved multiple mechanisms of conflict resolution including the executive heads of governments at the two levels, special tribunals, and eventually the Supreme Court. In the early years of the republic, political devices for disputes settlement were more frequent and effective. Recourse to political methods were facilitated by the prevalence of Congress dominance in New Delhi as well as in most of the States. Political reconciliation was also facilitated by the existence of towering leaders of the anti-colonial nationalist movement or new charismatic leaders. The Congress party under Nehru had nurtured a breed of reconciliatory leadership well-versed in democratic resolution of disputes. Such an approach was also encouraged by Article 262 of the constitution, which provides for parliamentary enactment "for the adjudication of any dispute or complaint with respect to·the use, distribution or control of the waters of, or in, any inter-State river or river valley". Subsequently, the Parliament enacted the Rivers Board Act and the Inter-State Water Disputes Act for this purpose. In recent years, however, there is a growing trend towards a cleavage between the party in power in New Delhi and other parties in power in some States (e.g., the conclaves of the non-Congress Chief Ministers in the first half of the 1980s). This trend explains why the earlier experiment of inter-State consultations in the four Zonal Councils consisting of all States in one region during the Congress predominance has fallen into disuse. One notices at present a growing reliance on judicial resolution of inter-state disputes.

#### **Proposals for Structural Reforms**

In the deliberations on the plethora of demands of constitutional restructuring by various political parties and State governments, a number of proposals for greater federalization of India's predominantly parliamentary system have emerged. These proposals are mainly related to the office of the Governor, the second chamber of the Parliament, autonomous federal instrumentalities mediating between the Central and State governments, decentralization of the planning process, and the local political systems in rural and urban areas below the State level with a view to strengthening them as a third effective tier added on to the two-tier federal structure. Rasheeduddin Khan pleads for "a comprehensive review and necessary recasting alterations, modifications and changes of the constitutional provisions, and the functioning aspect of the Centre-State relations, by a National Assembly, especially constituted for this purpose, representing a cross-section of public opinion, drawn from different political parties, public organizations, and expert groups."<sup>22</sup> This chapter is premised on the assumption that amendments to the 1950 constitution and a chastened sense of national purpose on the part of the political elites would be an adequate response to the growing crisis of governability.

# **Executive Federalism**

The office of the Governor has perhaps been the most contentious one in the Centre-State confrontations over the misuse of "President's rule" in States. Some parties and States governments have indeed gone to the extent of demanding its outright abolition. The Sarkaria Commission Report (1987-88) was seized with the problem of gubernatorial reforms, but was beset with the dilemma of ensuring States' autonomy, on the one hand, and maintaining the existing links between the two levels of government. It could not come up with a satisfactory way of combining the contradictory principles of a strong parliamentary Centre and strong State governments, a theme rhetorically emphasized by all Indian leaders, including Indira Gandhi. The Commission's resolution of this dilemma did not go beyond exhorting the establishment of sound federal conventions and normative patterns of behaviour on the part of the Governor and the Union Horne Ministry and the Cabinet respecting State autonomy.<sup>23</sup> A Canadian political scientist, Douglas V. Verney, has made a proposal that offers a way out of this dilemma of wedding a responsible parliamentary government with a "responsible" federalism. Verney seeks to slightly modify the existing Inter-State Council such that the President replaces the Prime Minister as the Chairman of the general body of the Council, while the Prime Minister continues to chair its standing committee. "The full President in-Council could then act as a federal buffer between the Union cabinet and the Governors. President's rule could initially be via the President-in-Council and not the Home Minister."<sup>24</sup> This could remove the sting of illegitimacy now surrounding a Central intervention in a State as the Inter-State Council is representative of both sets of governments. But, this device of responsible federalism is limited to "executive federalism" in the sense that the Inter-State Council brings together only the heads of the executive, whether of the Government of India or of the States. And this only gives a constitutional recognition and a constitutional structure, although this in itself may be a qualitative quantum jump to such informal devices as the Chief Ministers', Governors', Ministers', Secretaries', Speakers' conferences that have become a regular practice, though they work by consensus rather than voting.

# **Legislative Federalism**

A proposal for an effective exercise in "legislative federalism" has been made by the leading Indian political scientist Rajni Kothari. That the Rajya Sabha is a weak second chamber, federal in composition and name but largely "unfederal" in potentiality, is an old story. To make it a truly federal chamber, Kothari proposes that it may continue to be indirectly elected by State legislatures as now, but its electoral college may be expanded to include the district councils. Renamed as Pradesh Sabha (which, in fact, literally means the same as Rajya Sabha), the federal second chamber "should speak for the lower levels."<sup>25</sup> This proposal would, of course, go a long way in federalizing the Parliament. However, it is notable that an almost total irrelevance of the Rajya Sabha observed by W.H. Morris-Jones in his classic study on the Indian Parliament<sup>26</sup> in the early years of the Republic, has been changing in later years. The principal factor of change has been the differentiation in the parliamentary party system as well as the overall transformation of the party system. The Congress dominance of early decades in both chambers subsequently gave way to different parties holding sway in them, e.g., when the Congress lost in 1977 to the Janata Party, it still continued to enjoy a majority in the Rajya Sabha and effectively blocked some constitutional amendments sponsored by the Janata government. Moreover, with the Party system becoming one of a multi-partisan polarized pluralism since 1989, parliamentary power not only in the Rajya Sabha, but also in the Lok Sabha has become more manoeuvrable to the federal forces in the polity. Regional and nominally national parties have been playing decisive balancing role in federal coalition governments since 1989.

# **Autonomous Federal Instrumentalities**

Another package of constitutional reforms came in 1987-88 from the Commission on Centre-State Relations (chaired by Justice R.S. Sarkaria). Instead of dividing parliamentary powers on a more effective federal pattern between Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, the Sarkaria Commission proposes the constitutional entrenchment and/or strengthening of a series of points of autonomy in the federal government. These federal instrumentalities are the Inter-Governmental Council, National Economic Development Council, Finance Commission, and Planning Commission, all proposed to be invested with constitutional status, permanent existence, and regular secretariats.<sup>27</sup> Of these four bodies, the first two are political and economic in scope representing the executive branches of the two levels of the government, with the Prime Minister chairing. The latter two bodies consist of experts nominated by the Union Executive. So far, only the recommendations relating to the IGC has been implemented in 1990 under Article 263 of the constitution that had thus far remained unused. A National Development Council exists, but it does not have a constitutional status. The Planning Commission continues to be a creature of the Union Executive without a constitutional entrenchment. The Finance Commission does enjoy a constitutional status, but it is presently appointed by the President only in every five years to recommend on the patterns of sharing finances between the Central and State governments.

## **Democratic Decentralization**

"Democratic decentralization" in India has come to mean two things: (1) strengthening of local political systems as contrasted with the national and state political systems; and (2) decentralized planning involving local participation. A huge corpus of political and administrative thought has accumulated in India since independence on these two inter-related dimensions. But most of it still remains ideological and rhetorical with scanty implementation.

## **Local Political Systems**

The important landmarks in the evolution of local politics in the post-Independence period are the Community Development projects initiated with much fanfare in 1952, the Balwantrai Mehta Committee Report on Democratic Decentralization (1957), the Panchayati Raj Acts in the late 1950s and 1960s in various states mostly modelled on the Balwantrai Mehta Committee Report on Panchayati Raj (1957)<sup>28</sup>, and the Panchayati Raj and Nagarpalika constitutional Amendment Bills (1989) proposed by the Rajiv Gandhi government towards the end of its mandate, but defeated by the opposition majority in the Rajya Sabha. The idea was put into the constitution by the Congress minority government headed by P.V. Narasimha Rao in the form of the 73rd and 74th Amendments (1992-93). These amendments are models, like the Directive Principles which become binding on States only when the State Legislatures enact them into State laws. All States have revamped their Panchayati Raj institutions by now.

The Balwantrai Mehta Committee Report recommended a three-tier structure of Panchayati Raj. The Asok Mehta Committee Report expressed preference for a two-tier structure.<sup>29</sup> Most existing Panchayati Raj Acts enacted by various state legislatures still follow the three-tier structure of rural local self-governing bodies below the state level. Typically, there are councils at district, block, and village-cluster levels, known by various nomenclatures and semantically close to, say, Zila Parishad, Panchayat Samiti, and Gram Panchayat. The most frequently lamented malaise of Panchayati Raj are: (1) their non-functioning character; (2) conflict between the elected heads of the councils and the civil officials; and (3) domination of Panchayati Raj Acts bodies by the dominant castes and classes in collusion with the officials such that the development funds are siphoned off, resulting in infrastructural developments only on paper and depriving the depressed demographic targets of development. To an extent, these three charges are contradictory. If PR bodies are non-functioning, there would be little bone of contention between the officials and representatives. And, if they are in collusion with each other, there cannot be much conflict among them. The basic problem is that PR bodies are still waiting for a firm institutional functioning. Their inadequate performance is at least partly due to the failure on the part of state governments to devolve more powers and revenues to them. Besides, the voluntaristic vitality of the Indian rural society is presently at a low ebb.

However, there has recently been enthusiastic discussion of a more successful attempt at reviving the Panchayat Raj in at least three states: West Bengal, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. Moreover, the lot of these bodies appears to be relatively better also in Gujarat and Maharashtra than in many other states. West Bengal's Left Front government showed, even without structural reforms, a state government willing to hold regular elections and involve panchayats in development work and land reforms can make a qualitative improvement in the situation. The Janata government in Karnataka and the Telugu Desam government in Andhra Pradesh brought about new Panchayat Raj legislations in the 1980s. The Karnataka Zila Parishad and Mandai Panchayat Act (1985) established a three-tier structure with a Zila Parishad, Taluk Panchayat Samiti, and Mandal Panchayat. The Zila Parishad is the key-body in the structure and is partly elected and partly nominated. Its *Adhyaksha* (Chairman) is elected from amongst its members for a term of five years and receives the salary of a Minister of State. From the official side, the Chief Secretary of the Zila Parishad is a bureaucrat of the rank of a Deputy Commissioner. The new PR Act (1986) in Andhra Pradesh also established a three-tier structure with a Zila Praia Parishad, a Mandai Praja Parishad, and a Gram Panchayat. Alongside the Zila Praja Parishads at the district level, there are Pranalika Abhivrudhi Mandals (District Planning and Development Councils), since then replaced by Abhivrudhi Sameekasha (Review) Mandals (1987) in response to the criticism that in its earlier form it overshadowed and weakened the Zila Praja Parishads and, thus, went against the spirit of democratic decentralization. The Zila Praja Parishad consists of a Chairman (directly elected), Presidents of MandaI Praja Parishads of the district, and Members of the Parliament and Members of the Legislative Assemblies from the district without voting right. In addition to local taxes and grants from government and non-governmental agencies, the main source of fund for Zila Parishads is a certain per capita grant from state governments in both Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The Karnataka Act provides for the appointment of a Finance Commission by the state government to recommend on the financing of PR bodies.<sup>30</sup> The post-73rd Amendment (1993) conforming laws largely maintain these features.

The Asok Mehta Committee Report is emphatic on the district as the key-unit in PR and local level planning, and directs elections to these bodies, and adequate transfer of funds to them. To deliberate on the recommendations of this Committee, a Chief Ministers' conference was called in Delhi in August 1979. As a sequel to this, the Centre prepared a model PR Acts, but most States are yet to bring about a properly modelled enactment.<sup>31</sup>

Municipal governments in India are also, by and large, in a state of decay. Outside the metropolitan cities, corporations, and municipalities are mostly superseded and corrupted to the core. Administratively, they are not entirely non-functioning, though they operate at subsistence level outside the VIP areas. Their representative character is in double jeopardy because of frequent superseding and overly delayed elections.<sup>32</sup> However, two aspects of city government and politics in India point to a newly emerging scenario and deserves close observation.

#### **164** ✽ CHAPTER 8

 First, the metropolitan cities in India are emerging as an important element in the federal dynamics. They often directly enter into negotiations with the federal government not always intermediated by the State government. Secondly, they are acquiring demographic profile and cultural orientation that are often at variance with those of the States in which they are located. Though this often leads to tensions and conflicts between the ethnics dominant in the State and the migrants from other cultural regions or States to the city (e.g., the Maharashtrian Shiv Sena in Bombay and their anti-South and anti-North Indian stance and activities), yet it also reflects the emerging cosmopolitan culture in the metros. They may, in due course, become the nuclei of a new identity and orientation common all over the nation cutting across linguistic, religious, and tribal identities. But the progress in this direction is slowed by the tendency of ethnic migrants to the city to settle in ghettos of ethnically grouped new colonies, maintenance of strong social and economic bonds with the folks back home, and nativistic political movements by the locals, that is, Shiv Sena in Bombay. It may appear too far-fetched to visualize a territorial reorganization of India dispensing with the present state boundaries in favour of metropolitan zones cutting across ethnic and cultural boundaries.

# **Decentralized Planning**

Decentralized planning has been a creed of planning thought in this country almost since the beginning of the planning process.<sup>33</sup>There is, however, very little practice of it below the state level yet. Lack of will at the state level, lack of initiative and skills at the grassroots level despite growing levels of education and politicization are the main hurdles to decentralized planning. There are conflicting views on the proper area-unit for decentralized planning in more or less appropriate units by various protagonist. But, a wider consensus seems to be developing in favour of the district as a planning unit. Commenting on the practice in various states, a former member of the national Planning Commission observed:

"Whatever decentralized planning that is practised at the distinct level, is done essentially by the bureaucracy by putting together the various schemes undertaken by the different departments within the parameters set at the state level. In quite a few cases, this can even be descended as district planning done at the state level. Even planning at a regional level such as for hill areas in Uttar Pradesh is reduced essentially to the putting together of schemes undertaken by various departments at the state level and at best monitoring of the flow of resources into the region on account of such schemes."<sup>34</sup>

Nonetheless, the need for decentralized planning for a more appropriate use and distribution of resources with local/grassroots participation can hardly be gained.

## **Concluding Observations**

To conclude, we examined India's political dynamics through the conceptual prisms of a combination of parliamentary and federal institutional imperatives. What has emerged from our analysis is that, though the 1950 constitution continues to be a predominantly parliamentary one with subsidiary federal features, the political system in its actual working has been becoming more federal than a mere reading of the constitutional text may imply. There is also a growing pressure for a greater federalization of the system by constitutional amendments. In this concluding section, we intend to argue that we may indeed go further and see the ongoing political ferment in terms of the conceptual polarities of majoritarianism versus consensus models of democratic politics.<sup>35</sup> The consensus model seeks to break the majoritarian ethos of parliamentary democracy by a multiplicity of mechanisms for generating consensus by fabricating pluralities or concurrent "majorities". Federalism itself is only one of such devices. Other emerging features of this consensus model may be noted in passing: recourse to coalition and/or minority governments, judicial activism, and the growing reliance of the system on the judiciary for settling not only inter-state and federal disputes, but also those arising in ethnic diversities and class and regional disparities of the society. Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's preference for the flexibility of consultations on some issues in the National Integration Council and all-party meetings over exclusively formal bodies, like the Inter-Government Council, reliance on technocrats over politicians for policy-making in the areas of finance, agricultural pricing, and so on. David Taylor sees in Hindu political revivalism and resurgence of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a trend towards "social majoritarianism."<sup>36</sup> This is indeed a reaction against the consensus model gradually evolving since Independence. The Congress predommance in the Nehru and pre-1977 Indira Gandhi eras was indeed built on a voting bloc of minorities: Muslims, Sikhs, Harijans, and tribals. The Hindu communal leaders tended to decry it as "minorityism".

The present political ferment and the gathering conflicts may also be seen as the building up of a tension between the representative and participatory strains of the Indian political system. What makes the situation particularly difficult is that the system is facing overwhelming participatory pressures at the same time as it is still struggling to establish its representative character. Representative institutions established under the constitution are facing a trial due to the vitiation of the electoral process by money and muscle-power, criminalization of politics, pervasive political corruption, bossism in political parties, religious fundamentalism, separatism and terrorism, and persisting social and regional disparities. Participatory demands have been mounting enormous pressures in the form of social and political movements of all kinds: agrarian class radicalism of Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) or the so-called "Naxalites", communal revivalist and secessionist militant organizations in Jammu and Kashmir and Assam, "demand groups"<sup>37</sup>of peasants and industrial workers, environmentalists and grassroots mobilization groups. The party system and institutions of representative democracy are yet to come to terms with these participatory pressures in a coherent and institutionalized pattern. Only a concerted strategy of institutional reforms with an accent on federalization and electoral and party reforms alongside a sustained economic development would enable the system to tide over the persisting political and economic crises.
