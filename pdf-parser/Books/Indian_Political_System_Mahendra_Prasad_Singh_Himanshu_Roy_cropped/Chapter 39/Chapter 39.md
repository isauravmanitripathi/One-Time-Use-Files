# **Micro-movements and Future of Politics**

D.L. Sheth

he scene in which grassroots movements in India occur is varied and complex. The natural temptation is to begin with a discussion of definitional and morphological issues involved in identifying the phenomenon called "grassroots movements". We shall avoid this temptation as far as we can, for such an exercise may end up in drawing abstract conceptual boundaries around a phenomenon that is fluid and growing. Instead, we will directly describe the phenomena that we view as grassroots movements, although a better term could be found for it, no doubt. To be sure, anything that happens at the base of politics and acquires some political salience can be described as a political happening at the grassroots, and if it acquires some durable organizational form, one may even be tempted to describe it as a social movement.

For the present, however, my interest is limited to describing a particular genre of the grassroots movements which became politically visible in the mid-1970s and to examine its potential for transforming Indian politics, an avowed goal of these movements. Whatever may be their own self-perceptions, these movements, in the view of some observers of the grassroots scene in India have over the last decade or so been growing into the 'Fifth Estate' of Indian politics. For others, they represent bubbles on the political surface of India, which appear, burst and reappear from time to time without leaving much impact on the ongoing political life of the country. For still others, they represent seeds of change, with a potential to transform the nature of Indian politics.

Before forming a judgment, one way or the other, let me describe the phenomenon. We shall do this first by locating these movements in the political space from which they operate and which they have created for themselves. We shall then describe the issues they have raised in Indian

politics, and the organizational forms they have evolved to tackle these issues. Having done this, we hopefully shall be in a better position to judge their potential for transformation of the Indian polity.

# ❑❑ **The Decline of Institutional Politics**

A large number of these movements occupy social spaces created by the decline of the conventional mainstream politics of legislatures, elections, political parties, and trade unions. This decline, although it began earlier, became visible during the Emergency (1975-77) and has continued since.<sup>1</sup> The result is the retreat of democratic institutions from open, competitive politics where they continually sought to establish their claims for legitimization, into the pure politics of power and manoeuvre.<sup>2</sup> In the process, the political parties lost their national character, both in political and geographical terms. Their role in inducting new groups onto politics through waging struggles for their legal and political rights was considerably reduced. Their ability to process issues arising in the economy, society and culture declined greatly.

The parties failed to convert the economic demands of the poor and the deprived into effective political demands. Instead, some parties took the easy course of ethnicizing and communalizing the economic issues for electoral gains. The result was that the political process, which in the 1950s and 1960s worked for inclusion of the middle castes into the mainstream of Indian politics, got halted in the mid-1970s, keeping out large sections of ex-untouchables, the tribal people, the occupationally marginalized and economically extremely poor groups from among the ritually low-ranking Hindu castes, and the other poor and landless among the minorities. Of course, they were approached for their votes but only with all kinds of electoral gimmicks—the 1971 elections being the biggest of them all. Being leaderless, their struggles were sporadic and local in character and for that reason, their survival and dignity ceased to be issued in mainstream politics. The populations involved in these struggles were dispersed and fragmented on many dimensions besides that of class. For that reason, they were written off by the parties, especially those of the left, as unorganizable. In sum, the parties prematurely gave up their "movement" aspect, becoming increasingly just electoral machines operating with make-shift arrangements at the grassroots at election time. Having lost the capacity to retain the durable social and economic support they had once built, they have sought to forge such support anew at every election since 1971. The elections became more like referenda, and electoral mandates lost their appeal, at least, they ceased to inform the process of government formation and policy for any party elected to power.

The trade unions, which to begin with were like labour wings of the political parties, with the little autonomy of their own, became virtually bargaining counters between the people of the same class, supposedly representing different interests. The unions showed a complete incapacity to expand their activities in the growing informal and unorganized sector of the economy. Workers in this unorganized sector had little to offer, either electorally or in membership fees. Whatever ideological incentive was still there for expanding the activities of the trade unions to incorporate the workers outside the big factories and white collar establishments, got eroded as trade unions' incomes grew ever larger from the frequently raised membership fees and not infrequently from the wheeling and dealing of the leadership. Tired after long years of struggle, the union leadership got used to a cushy lifestyle and to a mentally non-taxing bureaucratic mode of functioning. In all this, their activities assured a sound financial base to the parties to which they belonged. So party leaders had no reason to complain.<sup>3</sup>

The legislatures reflected this change in the wider politics. Gone were the days when a Ram Manohar Lohia could raise and sustain a protracted debate on poverty in the Indian Parliament. The parliament increasingly becomes a handmaid of the executive branch, with the ruling party using the brute force of its majority to silence any debate on issues it considered inconvenient and uncomfortable for the government or its leaders. The net result was, the executive became the most powerful branch of governance and the judiciary a final arbiter of all political disputes. The political discourse began to be increasingly inform by narrow constitutionalist positions held by the executive and often endorsed by the law-courts rather than by issues emerging from democratic politics.<sup>4</sup> The Indian constitution which was held not only as an instrument of government but also as an agenda for social transformation became a document sanitized from the flesh and blood of social and political movements which enriched democratic politics.

### **The Context**

It is in this context of the decline of institutional politics that the grassroots movements emerged on the Indian political scene. They moved into niches yielded by the retreat of institutional politics. They took up issues and constituencies abandoned by the political parties and the trade unions, and those ill-served by the bureaucracy. In the process, they reformulated the issues and expanded their constituencies in a framework of politics that was non-electoral; the organizational form that evolved was not of a political party or a pressure group. It was a participative and mobilizational form of politics which sustained struggles on issues articulated by the people themselves and worked for their empowerment. Through these struggles, they expanded the meaning of constitutional politics insofar as they sought to justify their struggles in terms of the Directive Principles of State policy—a chapter in the constitutional provision of which are not justifiable in courts of law.

Although they share common political arenas and a broadly similar perspective on social transformation, the grassroots movements vary a great deal amongst themselves. The differences are with respect to their political lineage, size, geographical level of operation which may vary from a highly local to the provincial and national levels, the importance they attach to some issues over others, the populations they work for, and the organizational form they adopt. There are sporadic, short-term movements addressing a particular issue, like the liberation of bonded labour. There are also the long-term movements, with a developed organizational form, working for a specific constituency, like the farmers' movements. Then there are a series of single-issue movements active at the national, state, and local levels. These include the human rights organizations, working both in urban and rural areas. The most widespread ones are those that can be described as the "movement groups of social activists". These are groups of committed social activists forming themselves as a nucleus and working self-consciously as 'agency' for social and political transformation. Through involving and mobilizing people, to begin with on issues concerning them directly, they seek to harness the social energy so released, to a long-term movement for transforming power relations in the society.

In the decade after 1975, these groups of social activists multiplied into thousands and spread into different parts of the country.<sup>5</sup> They are now led by young men and women, usually from the middle or lower-middle classes, who have left their professional careers and founded or joined these movement groups in the rural areas and the tribal belts of the country. They take up various causes on behalf of the marginalized populations of the dalits, the tribal people, the landless, and women. They work on a long-term basis in small geographical areas for the goal they describe as "empowerment of the people". Some socially committed professionals and social activists have organized themselves for national-level campaigns for the right to shelter and to work.

Then there are legal aid groups, the groups for better health care for the people, popular culture and people's creativity groups, and popular science movements. There also are the new trade union movements launched by small groups of social activists organizing workers in the informal sector. These include organizations for self-employed women, the *beedi* workers (involved in hand-rolling of Indian cigarettes), workers in construction and public works, and those working in the small industrial and semiindustrial units like the powerloom and handloom factories. Included in this list, which is incomplete, are only those grassroots movements that self-consciously see themselves in the role of creating social transformation by using new means of political action. The traditional philanthropic and welfare organizations, the non-political developmental organizations, various front organizations of political parties and the sect-like organizations of the religious movements have been excluded, although the line dividing some of these organizations and those described above as grassroots movements is often thin.

The central thrust of these grassroots groups and movements is the politics of issues. They have not only raised new issues but have kept alive the old unresolved ones, issues long since given up by the political parties. These include such broad issues as human rights, women's rights, child labour, ecology, and communalism (chauvinism based on caste/religious identities or sentiments). More specific issues are also raised by different movements. These include bonded labour, atrocities perpetrated by the dominant castes on the dalits and tribal people, and the rights of the populations displaced by the big development projects of the state, private companies, and multinational corporations.

Long-term issues are also addressed by the movement groups at the micro-level but these have yet not acquired political salience at the national level. These issues pertain to the legal rights of the landless to minimum wages and working conditions, the access of the tribal people to the forest and forest products, and the poor people's rights to the village commons, such as to village grazing land, use of the so-called "wastelands", tilling dried-up lakes, ponds, and water reservoirs, fishing rights in common waters, and so on. Social issues are also taken up involving political mobilization around such controversies as dowry deaths (murdering of the wife by the husband and/or his kins for the inadequate sum of dowry received or for re-marrying another woman for dowry), burning of widows, rapes, and child labour. The list goes on and on.

The important fact is that almost all issues raised by the grassroots movements are ones on which the state is committed to act positively as ordained in the Directive Principles of the State Policy in the constitution but, being non-justiciable, they are not resolvable through recourse to the law-courts. Direct action by the people on these issues becomes, therefore, a preferred means of political action for the movement groups. Today, there is some group or the other working on these issues even in the most remote rural and tribal areas of the country. And yet the reach of the grassroots movements remains limited, both politically and geographically.

The enormity of the problems the grassroots movements have taken upon themselves is so great, that one wonders how long they can withstand the pressures and trials of their efforts, to continue to serve as a buffer between the state's growing coercion and the chaos in Indian society. It is the inability of the state, its bureaucracy, and its institutionalized politics to process these problems into their own arena that has created this overwhelming situation that the grassroots movements feel they are required to tackle. The activities of these movements are constantly on the move, spending most of their time and energy on firefighting; this leaves them little time for reflection or for interaction with those in movements other than their own.<sup>6</sup>

#### **Micro-Movements and Local Politics**

While they operate at the base of the Indian polity, the movements are not a part of what is conventionally understood as local politics. Until recently, that is while the one-party dominance of the Congress party reigned, local politics was vertically, even if loosely, coordinated by the macro-institutional structure of politics. The *panchayats* (village councils whose members are periodically elected through universal adult franchize), the cooperatives, the block development committees were also operated and politically coordinated through holding diverse caste-based factions into the politically accommodative structure of the Congress party. The factional alignments characterized the party system at the local level. But local politics has substantially changed, especially since the 1971 elections. This change, often attributed to the breakdown of one-party dominance is, rather the result of changes that have been taking place at the base of the society. And these changes have created new political space at the local level, which has now been occupied by the movement groups.

Let us quickly index only a few of such changes. The relations between castes, which often are hereditary occupational groups, hitherto based on the principle of a barter-like reciprocal system of goods and services (the *jajmani* system), have been fully monetized. A much greater proportion of the rural population over two-thirds now lives in bigger villages, with populations of over one thousand. At the same time, the bulk of the population in an average village now consists of owner-cultivators and the landless labourers. The other categories such as the priestly, trading and artisan castes, are either moving out of the villages into the nearby towns or are getting absorbed into the ranks of owner-cultivators or the landless labourers. The Indian village, which was primarily a social system within which economic activities subsisted, is now acquiring the character primarily of an economic organization in which social relationships are getting defined in terms of relations between employers and employees, between wagelabour and capital. The so-called "caste conflict" is now mainly between the dominant castes of the owner-cultivators and the castes of the landless labourers, with the former having lost their traditional claim on the labour of the latter.

The changes in the village social structure have changed the nature of conventional local politics, the political parties, operating on the old assumptions, have not been able to address themselves to the new issues that have sprung up in rural India. Instead, as we saw earlier, the issues are being taken up by the movement groups operating from outside such institutions of local politics such as the panchayats, the cooperatives, and the local units of the parties.

# **Micro-Movements and Mainstream Politics**

From this description of the micro-movements, the political spaces they occupy, the issues they articulate, and the organizations they have spawned, it should be clear that they represent a fairly heterogeneous but vigorous element of political action at the grassroots of Indian politics. But they function as disparate micro-movements, each zealous in guarding its identity, autonomy, and territory. They resent any effort by a macro-organization, even by a non-party political formation, at the national or regional level to coordinate their activities or federate them into a larger political entity. They align with some others on issues, join up for common causes, even create joint fronts. But they do all this only around specific issues and for the duration for which the struggle lasts. They refuse to become organizational parts of, or to create for themselves, any larger long-term movement. This, despite the fact that many among them share a common perspective on problems, especially in terms of their critique of the existing political and social order and the model of development. Not only this, in their programmes and activities they manifest a common approach and methodology of struggle. They work on similar issues and for the same types of constituencies, albeit in different geographical areas. There may be cultural explanations for such a strange situation of separation, but they will not be resorted to for the present.

The important fact is that there seems no possibility, in the foreseeable future, of these micro-movements emerging as a larger nationwide political movement by forging coalitions, alliances, and mergers among themselves. It is for this reason that the activists and intellectuals of the political parties and some observers of the grassroots scene in India do into attaching much political significance to the micro movements. In this view, any movement that does not make a visible impact, either on government policies or electoral politics, has no political future. The activists of the movement, however, do not share the view of conventional revolutionary politics, in which movements, are conceived and carried out with the ultimate objective of capturing state power.<sup>7</sup>

For them, the capture of state-power is not a precondition for social transformation. There indeed are some differences within the micromovements on whether they should completely rule out, even from a largerterm theoretical perspective, the goal of acquiring or capturing state-power, however remote that possibility might appear today. As we shall see later, this particular issue has become quite important, linked as it is with the issue of the use of violence, and the controversy has resulted in the splitting of some groups and movement. But a large number of the movement groups, including those inheriting the Marxist-Leninist tradition of struggle, prefer to leave this issue dormant, if not to ignore it totally. They believe that a premature and excessive concern about capturing state-power suppresses the real issues of politics and social transformation, distorts the priorities in the struggle, and gives rise to authoritarian tendencies within the organizations of the movements.

The groups belonging to the Gandhian *sarvodaya* (a neo-Gandhian movement which emphasized cooperation as against conflict between classes as a means of social transformation), socialist, and even liberal traditions, however, clearly reject capture of state-power, even as an ideal.

#### **714** ✽ CHAPTER 38

They find the concept overly political and distracting from the long-term struggles for the decentralization of economic and political power. According to them. This can only be achieved through changing the forms of organization and building peoples' own capabilities, rather than through changes, if achieved in the broader society and culture, may ultimately result is the transformation of the state itself.

Whatever the nuances of their positions on the issue of state-power, in practice the micro-movements of all types, function away from mainstream politics. Theirs is the politics of issues, of winning rights, and of changing the consciousness of the people. This often brings them into a confrontation with the state, the bureaucracy, the law and order machinery, the local power structures, and sometimes even with the political parties and established trade unions. They view such confrontations as an aspect of the large, long-term struggle for political and social transformation, and not as a means of directly competing with the political parties for the legitimacy-claims in the prevalent system. Instead, they emphasize withdrawal of legitimization, by separating themselves from the institutions of mainstream politics and devoting their energies to building the people's own organizations. In the process, they view situations of conflicts as the means of raising people's consciousness and building the awareness of the people, rather as the means of capturing state-power.

This, however, does not mean that they are opposed to the institutional framework of Indian democracy. In fact, they consider institutional democracy as a necessary condition for their functioning, but not a sufficient condition for their long-term goal of political and social transformations.<sup>8</sup> For this goal to be achieved, they believe that the political battleground needs to be shifted away from the mainstream politics into the society and culture. In this sense, while they do not view the functioning of institutional democracy as representing forces hostile to their agenda of social transformation, working within and for it is not something high on their agenda. Their political agenda, instead, is further democratization, not only of the political institutions but of the family, the community, the workplace, and the society at large.

#### **Micro-Movements and the Politics of Transformation**

The self-perception of these grassroots movements is, thus, not merely of being pressure groups working for the rights and benefits of specific constituencies. They view themselves as movements for political and social transformation, and their methodology consists in involving the people in redefining the basic issues concerning the relationship between society and politics. Let us illustrate this point briefly with a reference to the three major grassroots movements: the human rights, the ecology, and the feminist movements.<sup>9</sup>

The issue of human rights as viewed by the activists of several human rights groups is not limited to the conventional legal notion of civil liberties; it also extends to situations in which individuals and groups are denied the satisfaction of their basic needs. The poorest among the poor have in their view lost out in both respects. Thanks to the model of development adopted by the state, the poor are neither entitled to become full wage-earners in the economy nor full-fledged citizens in the polity. The politics of micromovements, therefore, lies not merely in fighting particular infringements of legal rights of citizens, but in creating and expanding new political and civic spaces for them by converting the survival and development needs of the poor and the deprived into struggles of their economic, political, and cultural rights and these not only of individuals *qua* individuals but of groups and communities surviving on the margins of the civil society. In the process, the activists link rights of access to and benefits from the development process with the issues of ethnic identity and human dignity, and view the satisfaction of material needs as a pursuit not detached from the spiritual and cultural aspects of human existence. Several movement groups that are not single-issue organizations for human rights relate to human rights movements through such a perception of rights.

Similarly, the ecology movements do not view ecology as merely a cost factor in development, as many ecology academics do. Nor are they interested in specifying tolerable levels of ecological destruction necessary for achieving higher levels of economic development as modernizing regimes tend to do.<sup>10</sup> Instead, they view ecology as a basic principle of human existence, which, if reactivated, can yield higher level principles for reorganizing the economy in human terms and refocus development in terms of well-being, in which, to use Gandhiji's well-known phrase, "everybody shall have enough for his or her need, but not for his or her greed".

The activists of the women's movements have lately been defining their problem not merely in terms of achieving equal benefits and access for women is the present system. They self-consciously take up such issues mainly for finding entry points to the submerged world of Indian womanhood: but their long-term goal, as they put it, is to change the working of the gender principle itself in the economy and society, such that both society and economy become more just and humane. They find the ecological worldview of the movement more aligned with the feminine principle. The fusion of the ecological and gender principles, they argue, is conducive for a more humane economic and political organization of the society than that of development which, in their view is founded on the principle of maledomination over all aspects of human life and nature. Their project, working together with the human rights and ecology movements, is thus to change the forms of organization and consciousness in society.<sup>11</sup>

Guided by this broad perspective, these movements are often able to forge links with each other in fighting for issues at the grassroots. It is not accidental that ecology movements like the Chipkoo movement have the participation of women, and that the Bodhgaya movement for the rights of the landless in Bihar is viewed by its participants as a movement for total revolution in which women play significant leadership roles. Women are in the movements fighting for the rights of the population displaced by development projects, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Similarly, human rights organizations often team up with women's organizations on issues of dowry, *sati* (self-immolation of a widow by burning herself on her husband's funeral pyre), rape, and equal wages. Similarly, activists in women's groups took on an active role in mobilizing and assisting the victims of the Bhopal chemical disaster. At no time in independent India, in the movements led by the parties and trade unions, was there ever such a high degree and such a sustained level of participation by women as one witnesses today in the non-party political movements at the grassroots.

Even as these movements seek to acquire greater perspective and coherence, they confront situations of division and splits within their own organizations. Currently there is active debate among these groups on five issues which has resulted in splitting some groups and joining together of some others. The issues are over the appropriate attitude the grassroots movements should adopt towards (1) the use of violence, the specific issue being violence as a justifiable means of self-defence for the people versus complete reliance on non-violent methods of *satyagraha* as a mode of conducting struggles; (2) acquiring/capturing state-parties in the electoral politics versus engaging themselves solely in the non-electoral and nonparty politics; (3) the kind of relationship the groups/movements should maintain with the political parties in the conduct of their own struggles; (4) cooperating with the state in implementing certain development schemes that may provide immediate short-term benefits and relief for the poor; and (5) accepting foreign funds.

These controversies have resulted in some activists leaving the movement and joining political parties; some have formed themselves into apolitical-type NGOs. The issue of violence has, for example, split an old movement in the Bodhgaya but it has also given rise to the larger formation of two types of movement groups in Bihar—those who believe in the interracial use of violence and those who assert their faith in the *satyagraha* type of non-violent struggle.

This review of the large, almost 'overwhelming', canvass of the grassroots movements suggests that the grassroots movements in India can best be viewed as stirrings within the civil society which, by acquiring selfconscious organizational forms, expand the frontiers of the civil society to include the vast population on its periphery. Their long-term objective, it seems to me, is to bring the modern state in India, which has hitherto remained away and above the society, under the command of the civil society.

Such stirrings indeed are noticeable in many countries of the world today.<sup>12</sup> The moot question is whether the world constitutional order will emerge and expand through the process of the formation of a civil society at the global level, with concommitant growth of global citizenship, or will it be imposed top-down *a la* the GATT, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and now the new Eco-regime which may be fabricated in the post-Rio Earth Summit politics of big powers. The grassroots movements in India, as do the 'new movements' in other parts of the world, represent a powerful counterveiling force to the top-down process which has acquired a new clout in the post-cold war world. If there is still any hope for achieving a just and peaceful order for the world as a whole, the thinking on the constitutional order has to align with the new politics of movements.
