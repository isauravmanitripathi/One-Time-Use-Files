# **Science and Technology Policy**

*Subir Verma* 

# ❑❑ **Science, Technology, and Development**

Originating in the ambits of tremendous optimism about the western model of liberal democratic industrial modernity in the aftermath of the Second World War, development studies an extremely heterogeneous and inter-disciplinary had asserted the mutually beneficial nature of the relationship between the developed and the developing world and the possibility of transference of theoretical knowledge from the former to the latter.<sup>1</sup> Such an ideological support system, posited on the intellectual genius of the western socio-technological knowledge, had justified the transplantation of western culture, institutions and technology for the social, economic, and political changes in the developing countries. Accordingly, development of the underdeveloped countries had implicated their transition in a unilinear and teleological fashion from the ideal-typical pattern variables of tradition to those of western-style modernity, as epitomized by the USA. Thus conceived, development had involved not simply a process/stages of change but also a progressive transformation towards a goal. And this development, stylized as modernization, couched within which was westernization, had to be brought about by the modernizing elites.<sup>2</sup>

This tyrannization of historical possibilities, encapsulated in the ruling motif of development, had been succinctly captured by Jawaharlal Nehru, independent India's first Prime Minister: "Politics led me to economics and this led me inevitably to science and the scientific approach to all our problems and to life itself. It was science alone that could solve these problems of hunger and poverty, of insanitation and illiteracy, of superstition and deadening custom and tradition, of vast resources running waste, of a rich country inhabited by starving people."<sup>3</sup> Immanent in this instrumentalist notion of science had been the need for rapid industrialization poised on indigenous, scientific, and technological capacity as the lynchpin of development and the transmutation of the governing culture and values, institutions and processes on the test of scientific temper, and hence rationalization and secularization.

Four and a half decades of planning for scientific and technological development, India far from extracting the benefits of the scientific and technological revolution still faces inequity, injustice, and dependency. In the present dispensation of the deification of the market expressing the globalization and homogenization of the production and consumption systems, an evaluation of the science and technology policies, isolated as critical inputs in development, becomes therefore imperative.

# ❑❑ **History—The Seeds of the Future Design**

There was an urgency inspiring the Nehruvian call for a total renaissance of India. Under the British rule, India was not only bypassed by the industrial revolution but instead was de-industrialized and de-developed. Under the imperial scheme of things, not much thought was given to the application of science and technology in the economic development of India, forsaken as an agricultural colony. Consequently, because of a narrow policy, a vast technological gap appeared between the elites, fostered on British created opportunities exploited through the brazen adoption of English culture and striving to add political power to traditional priestly, commercial, and literary power, and the masses whose life-work was yet to be permeated with science and who pathetically lacked in scientific attitude, as also between India as a whole and the developed countries of the West.<sup>4</sup> Add to this, the fact that on the eve of independence, India was caught in the horrendous thores of partition and an equally abysmal poverty seen in low production and narrow productivity base.<sup>5</sup> Planned efforts towards correction and reconstruction was purportedly to be built upon developing the scientific and technological capability of the effulgent nation.

These imperatives notwithstanding, the seeds of the direction that the Indian society was required to undertake a planned industrial society integral to which was to be industrial research was sown in the preindependence period itself.

In fact, the process of institutionalization of Western science in India, even though it was to subserve the needs of colonial presence and penetration, had commenced with the establishment of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1784 and its lineages of Great Surveys and Learned Societies.<sup>6</sup> However, the first efforts towards original research and its application began as a reaction to the pronounced literary bias of the modem education based on Macaulay'S Minutes and Wood's Despatch and with the formation of the Indian Association for the cultivation of science and the University College of Science. But, then, the systematic exposition of the envisaged order emerged only in the Indian Industrial Commission which was set up in 1916 in the vortex of the first world war's articulation of the needs of Indian industries. Here the discourses had crystallized at three levels: (1) the need to transform India from an agricultural to an industrial way of life with the colonial state as a pedagogue and a sponsor of organizations; (2) the role of science in mediating the transition from plantocracy to technocracy; and (3) the relationship of science and technology with the industrial process.<sup>7</sup>

While the recommendations of the Holland Commission fell victim to the logistics of war, by 1942 the cutting off of imports and the need to develop India as a supply base for the eastern theatre of World War II once again brought home the necessity of shifting the research emphasis from agriculture and medicine to import substitution. Support from the scientific organizations and scientists for this had already crystallized with the Meghnad Saha's Science and Culture Group orchestration of the need for planned industrialization underpinned by scienticized technology, institutionalized through industrial research, and guided by scientists and technocrats, informed with statistical inputs.<sup>8</sup> Fortified by the political support that had come forth in the form of Nehru's message "the future belongs to science and those who make friends with science and seek its help for advancement of humanity,"<sup>9</sup> the British Indian government constituted the Board of Scientific and Industrial Research (1940), the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (1942), the Industrial Utilization Bureau, the Hill Commission, and upon its recommendations, the Department of Planning and Development. The Resolution on Industrial Policy, the setting up of the Planning Commission and the founding of the National Physical Laboratory and the National Chemical Laboratory with India's independence, belong to the same historical genre.

### **Science and Technology Policy Making 1947-84**

The making of science policy in the first decade after independence was the outcome of the active, personal, and professional relationship of Nehru, Bhatnagar, and Bhabha. As such there was a lack of systematic institutionalized process of decision-making and a pernicious susceptibility to the constituency method based bargaining among interested agencies and groups. The result was a concentration on CSIR for industrial research and on nuclear energy establishments to the obvious neglect of such key sectors as agriculture, medicine, and even defence as larger priorities for India in the making of science and technology.<sup>10</sup>

On the other hand, state organization of research acquired further urgency given the absence of any sizeable base or industrial infrastructure and therefore of any economic reasons/demands of industry for industrial research. And so the First Five-Year Plan had expressed the need for creating and consolidating scientific arid technological infrastructure and its coupling with new social, economic, and political objectives. This had devolved on the policy makers the objectives of building a chain of research institutes and laboratories and of creating a stock of scientific and technical manpower.

By the Second Five-Year Plan, the irresistible march of rapid industrialization was recognized as the catalyst for social transformation. Formally recasted thus, it presaged a big push to the economic structure with considerable emphasis on investment goods sector to the short-term detriment of the consumer goods industries. The demands on science and technology arraigned itself to the programme for rapid industrialization through a massive import-substitution effort with the major emphasis on developing the basic and heavy industry.

On the supply side came the Science Policy Resolution. Introduced in the Parliament in 1958, this Magna Carta of the science of India proclaimed the philosophical commitment and objectives of the government. It expressed the intention to obtain all the benefits that can accrue from the acquisition and application of scientific research in terms of developing indigenous science and technology base, reducing the gap between the advanced and the backward countries and national participation in the march of human civilization. In programmatic terms, it exposited the aims for efforts to foster, promote and sustain the cultivation of science and scientific research, to ensure adequate supply and training of scientists and to provide conducive environment-material compensation, freedom, status and involvement in decision-making for facilitating creativity.<sup>11</sup>

Beyond this outlining of noble intentions, the resolution remained silent about the modalities to relate the work of the scientists to the productive system. Indeed it revealed Nehru's almost magical belief in the efficacy of science, that there is a direct and an automatic correlation between scientific research and the beneficial impact on the production process. Such an assumed linkage poised on science-based big push not only obviated the seed for a well documented, rational, and coherent technology policy but also, by implication, created structures devoid of any functions, means divorced from ends. Science became a consumption item.

This was no mere gainsaying, given the fact that it is not the science policy but the technology policy which is more closely related to the socioeconomic development of a nation. For, in an era of industrialized science and scienticized technology, the process of innovation for higher productivity and speed and rate of manufacturing capital and consumer goods required research and development as an immediate take-off from the scientific invention. More than the scientific research, therefore, the development of indigenous capabilities in technology and their utilization are influenced by policies relating to import of technology and the strategies adopted for industrial growth. Seen thus, Nehru did have a technology policy. For, the official policy of technology import for producing heavy iron and steel, chemicals and machine making was implicitly a recognition of the Japanese model of industrialization. And yet in the absence of vigorous domestic Research and Development (R&D) it was flawed.

In any case, when it was considered premature to place demands on science and technology to contribute to specific development problems either in industry or agriculture and when the immediate shortage of food grains and consumer goods were met through imports and the modernization of industry was based on foreign technology and investment, the science and technology policies of the period was never integrated with the national economic policies. Besides, there was no rational policy for science or even guiding principles of decision-making on the magnitude and distribution of funds for scientific research. Indeed, the fundings were decided more by the absorptive capacity of the agencies and institutions concerned than by the considerations of the economic or social importance of the fields, or by the most fundamental question "What is this science for? Above all, the absence of an agency to promote indigenous technology debilitated any determined effort to utilize technological capabilities already developed in the country."<sup>12</sup>

All These Led Broadly to Two Related Consequences

- 1. Despite the creation of a sufficient R&D and an economic infrastructure, the hiatus between science and technology, laboratory and industry, and therefore between the supply and demand of the national scientific and technical manpower resulted into wasteful, reckless, and repetitive imports, forced savings for resource mobilization, fewer employment opportunities in highly capital intensive framework in which consumer durables or immediate payoffs to the public works was postponed. And as the high-cost economic regime shaded into one suffering from foreign exchange constraint, which was itself used to decide the technological policy,<sup>13</sup> and therefore the one in which the desire to have rapid industrialization put locally produced technology to a discount, especially when the resources for investment into R&D was available the application and commercial exploitation of a small proportion of the scientific results achieved attracted considerable public attention.
- 2. As a result of the above, the scientific scene in the late sixties presented an arena of intense controversy, the appointment of the committee after committees, questioning "introspection, discussions in and outside the press and the Parliament and in scientific forums on the strategy, organization, and planning of science and industrial R&D."<sup>14</sup>

The Indira era is noteworthy for the efforts to relate technology policy with economic development, social change, self-sufficiency, and self-reliance.<sup>15</sup> Science and technology policy making became a public affair, participatory for the scientific community and institutionalized as a whole. The setting up of National Council of Science and Technology in 1971 was an important step towards systematic planning of science and technology for development.<sup>16</sup> Its endeavour must be seen in the context of the demand for safeguards against fluctuations in agricultural production, steep hike in the prices of major import items thereby constraining debtservicing in an era of uncertain foreign aid.

In 1973 the NCST produced the policy document entitled II An approach to science and technology policy. This document is significant, not only, for demonstrating that the scientific and technological efforts must be planned and geared to concrete socio-economic goals, but also, because it is the first official acknowledgment that the framework of our various scientific and industrial policies so far had a predilection to imported technology and even to turnkey-jobs-a predilection that has encouraged irrelevant needs and high cost and undermined self-reliance. To that effect it emphasized:

- 1. The need to develop indigenous science and technology capacity by training people for the understanding and absorption of imported technology and by giving incentives in terms of reassuring enhancements of productive capacity beyond the formally licensed level to industries affecting technological improvements.
- 2. The utilization of a mix of imported and indigenous scientific and technological resources in which the indigenous component will increase.
- 3. Increasing the bargaining power of the country in the International Technology Market that is monopolistic and in which technology is tied up with aid.

Overall, the Approach Paper lacked an understanding of the essential elements of the socio-economic context that perpetuates the import of technology and the altered context that will oppose this process. Even while momentously castigating import-substitution by one to one indigenous substitute for entrenching a consumption pattern dominated by the metropolitan sector, it failed to suggest any *alternative consumption piJllem*  and the modus-operandi for its actualization. Implicit was also the failure to perceive clearly and state explicitly as to what were the objectives of self-reliance and national development.

The result was that the scientific and technological capability remained deficient. Thus (1) in large areas of economic activity relatively obsolete, cost-ineffective technology continued to be applied, and the pace of technological innovation and absorption of available technology remained unimpressive; (2) calculated risk-taking and development of risk reduction through systematic application of indigenous science and technology remained weak; and (3) financial support for science and technology activities and linkages between the various sectors and policies conducive to the use of indigenous efforts remained insufficient.<sup>17</sup>

By 1980 acute inflationary pressure was generated by the setbacks in such critical sectors as power, coal, steel, and railway, the steep rise in petroleum prices, low capacity utilization in several industries, inadequate utilization of irrigation potential and lower yields per acre in agriculture. The Sixth Five-Year Plan had therefore aimed at (1) rapid increase in economic growth rate by improving the efficiency in the use of resources and higher productivity; (2) strengthening inputs of upgraded technology for modernization; and (3) speedy development of indigenous sources of energy conservation and use.

This was the setting for the Technology Policy Statement announced in the 70th session of Indian Science Congress Association at Tirupati in January, 1983. It proclaimed that the use and development of technology must relate to people's aspirations, technological self-reliance, local needs, and, finally, to development based on our culture and personality. This context would then govern the choice of technology which would be evaluated on the touchstone of four E's. (energy, efficiency, employment and Environment).

All this did not rule out the import of technology, particularly when it talked about its acquisition, adaptation, and upgradation appropriate to national priorities and resources. However, such imports were not to be normally permitted where indigenous technology was adequately developed and the onus would be on the seeker of foreign technology to demonstrate its necessity while concomitantly contributing to adequate, R&D for its subsequent absorption, adaptation and upgradation.

On the other hand, the indigenous technological capability was to be encouraged by enhancing traditional skills and capabilities, upgrading to prevent obsolescence, providing fiscal incentives, strengthening design engineering and consultancy services and offering incentives for setting up in-house R&D units in the country.

The goal of the technology policy was self-reliance that neither meant autarky nor even self-sufficiency; instead it was redefined to mean "selfreliance of judgement"<sup>18</sup> in making a technological choice.

In sum, science and technology policy as it evolved through plans and related policies were geared towards the following objectives and goals:

- 1. Creation of infrastructure for research;
- 2. Promotion of basic research;
- 3. Research and development for import-substitution and exportpromotion;
- 4. Self-reliance, self-sufficiency and national security;
- 5. Science for the resolution of social and economic problems and hence for the people.

## **Indigenous Scientific and Technological Capability**

Now the scientific and technological capability of a developing nation is governed by the dialectics of imported technology and domestic R&D for its local adaptation, improvement and innovation and even export in the spectrum of technology dependence-independence continuum. Woven in this context are also the themes of self-reliance and self-sufficiency operational as they are in (1) reductions of imports and (2) import-substitution and utilization of indigenous technology.

But then the import of technology,<sup>19</sup> discernible in the rate of approvals of foreign collaboration, has continued unabated. Herein the policies on technology-import, as K.K. Subrahmanian has pointed out, has traversed through three phases: (1) period of liberalization until the mid-60s when the rate of approval per annum increased from about 35 until 1955 to 104 during the Second Plan period and touched 365 in the heyday of the Third Plan. This was in the era of sterling balance and the official thinking that the foreign exchange cost of the projects would be met by the capital-inflow part of the package. (2) Period of regulation since then and until the mid/ late 70s when it remained at the low level of 204 per annum in the context of foreign exchange crisis and illustrative lists of areas, basis and conditions for such imports. This was the period of FERA and licensing. (3) Period of relaxation since then with the rate of foreign collaboration approvals in the course of modernization of capital equipment in the Indian industry rising up to 504 per annum.<sup>20</sup>

The direct impact of technology imports has been the remorseless outflow of foreign exchange on account of servicing and on the country's balance of payment, more adversely in the case of foreign direct investment (remittances of profits and dividends) than in the case of licensing (lump sum payments, royalties, and technical fees). Underpinning it, and even more deleterious, has been its indirect consequences. Insofar as such imports are tied up with certain regulatory clauses-sources of supplies and raw materials, restrictive clauses, purchase of raw materials, tampering with designs and original specifications, it subverted the local technological capacity for their diffusion, adaptation, and assimilation. All this not only led to repetitive, wasteful and indiscriminate imports with the increasing import-dependence as a logical fallout but also in as much as the foreign collaborators inserted clauses restricting the exports of the importing firms or discouraged it through a demand for higher royalties on export-turnover, it had a stifling impact on foreign exchange earnings as another debilitating social cost.

On the other hand, the very import-substitution and utilization of indigenous technology, a question of domestic R&D system, subsisted under a series of constraints.

Organizationally, the mammoth infrastructure and stock of scientific and technical manpower not withstanding, R&D in India has been delinked from the production process.<sup>21</sup> While in the advanced industrial countries, R&D projects actually originate from the production problems and the future projections of the corporate body and is either self-financed or government-sponsored-thereby generating technological competence, spinoffs, and even financial self-sufficiency-in India, the obverse has been true. The main expenditure on R&D has been borne by the Central government (about 74 per cent) and has been concentrated in the public industrial research laboratories. This reversal of role between the government and the private corporate sector has had its own debilitating consequences:

- 1. Given the lack of market research about the expected rate of return, active life-cycle and predictability of the degree of utilization of the process know-how, the innovation chain has largely remained incomplete.
- 2. Technologies so produced were marketed at an under developed stage and bench scale, without any pilot plant test and trial demonstration for large-scale manufacture. The private and even public corporate sector had therefore no economic reasons to buy it especially when postpurchase developmental consultancy, because of the geographical segregation of the laboratory and the industrial location, was inefficient.
- 3. The very selection of the research projects and technology were made on national and social consideration as against the private and profit considerations of the private sector and evaluation of the public sector performance.
- 4. The inhouse R&D in private sector became and has remained so, a mere window dressing fashioned to extract advantages of government incentives in terms of taxes, licensing, and subsidies. For, not only has their share in the expenditure on R&D and the corpus of personnel engaged therein been abysmal, but interestingly 70 per cent of the R&D personnel so engaged had graduate, diploma or even lower qualifications implying that most of them were engaged in routine duties of quality-control or testing and not so much on product and process R&D. Besides, these companies which had foreign collaborations were even less active in setting up R&D divisions, perhaps owing to the availability of newer technology from their parent bodies. Finally, the R&D activity in the subsidiaries was confined merely to minor product modification, raw material substitutes, etc.<sup>22</sup>

Besides, apart from the profile of R&D in the private corporate sector providing another angle for the explanation of the role-swapping between the government and the private sector along with all its deleterious outcome, has been the fact that the very industrial research in India subsisted within the context of the development of under-development. According to Shiv Vishwanathan, this internationally is an institutional system of obsolescence and has imposed literal death on a whole series of primary products (fibres, dyes, etc.) and the development and utilization of indigenous technology in the context of maintaining the comparative advantage of the developing countries.<sup>23</sup>

Finally, at the level of policy, the government frequently permitted collaborations and technology-imports irrespective of their application in the local environment, the efficiency of the local alternatives and the need to develop indigenous technology. While this proctivity of the government to go for market solutions to its needs is partially explainable in terms of its foregoing organizational constraints, the level of expenditure on R&D as one per cent of GNP (0.9 per cent)—meagre in terms of international comparisons of structurally competitive economics—and confused policy signals to the CSIR, it sufficiently dampened the indigenous initiative to create, duplicate or even imitate the developed technology.<sup>24</sup>

It is in this backdrop that the science and technology policy under the paradigmatic imprimatur of liberalization and structural adjustment and its concomitant underpinnings—the new industrial policy and trade policymust be understood and evaluated.

## **Science and Technology Policy-Making Since 1984**

In the emergent dynamics of the fiscal crisis of the state, hemmed in with the balance of payment crisis, industrial recession, negative growth rate and bounding inflation, the panacea by the Indian policy-makers, since the mideighties and more especially in the nineties, have been seen in the greater integration of India with the global economy. The resultant economic liberalization measures, deregulation and privatization under the dispensation of modernization plans and structural adjustment policies are all designated to welcome foreign investment and technological collaborations. The objective is to open up the inward-looking industrial/technology system to marketforces and global competition in which the acquired modern technology with the attendent marketing expertise and modern managerial techniques will inject technological dynamism, increase productivity, produce qualitatively superior goods at internationally competitive prices, increase exports and expand the production-base. The implication of all this in terms of the trends visible so far on the scientific and technological capability of the country has been very grave. These are the following:

- 1. The whole of India's production structure based on high technology is being brought under the ambits of joint ownership and management of Indian and foreign business interests. Given the setting where foreign equity participation has been raised to 51 per cent, where NRIs have been allowed 100 per cent equity participation with full benefits of repatriation of capital and income accruing thereof, in high priority industries, and where foreign collaboration agreements spiralled from an average 702 in early 1980 to 4000 in 1989, the trans-national corporations are now in a position to dictate the kind of technology to be introduced, its management and its transfer. In as much as the clause of export-obligation and technology-transfer have been jettisoned, their R&D efforts are being confined to only locating and adopting locally available materials to substitute some of the imported ones because of the pressure to reduce foreign exchange purchases. India is not only being turned into a provider of a large and growing market but also a dumping ground for obsolescent technology selling under foreign brand names which would finance the R&D efforts of the TNCs for the production and marketing of technologically superior products elsewhere.
- 2. There is being, in fact can be, no genuine absorption, adaptation, and development of indigenous technology under such a policy framework

where technology import is encouraged in the name of accelerating growth and modernisation of Indian industry. Indeed, there can be no genuine transfer of technology (it would be only of know-how and not of know-why) unless the imported technology is supplemented with internal R&D efforts for adaptive changes (mastering the manufacturing capability) as well as innovations for developing new processes and products (design capability). But then, as K.K. Subrahmanian has shown in his analysis of the electronics industry, economic liberalism, insofar as the incentive-structures of the market is biased towards continuous technology-imports for maximizing short-term gains, has distorted technology-behaviour of the firms in the direction of indifferent internal learning (R&D), albeit raising the firm's technological level on the basis of continued dependence on technology-imports and attainment of higher levels of productivity and output-growth.<sup>25</sup>

This technological backwardness would be even more entrenched given the envisaged role of the CSIR and the approach of the government as inscribed in the next Five-Year Plan.

Now the fourth review committee of the CSIR, while condemning the tendency to re-invent the wheel by placing disproportionate emphasis in terms of work on known' products and known process of the CSIR, had called upon the latter to move towards greater orientation to longterm research projects. It thus divested the CSIR of short-term technology-utilization linked to foreseeable economic returns and consigned the generation, absorption, adaptation of industrial technology to in-house R&D establishments of the industries-both public and private.<sup>26</sup> It was this lack of linkages with the demand from the production system and continued foreign assistance in basic engineering activities/product design and consultancy, that the Eighth Five-Year Plan has cited as the major constraints in the promotion of indigenous technology.<sup>27</sup> This becomes especially glaring when the Indian industries, according to it, needed a technological thrust for modernization and self-reliance. Inasmuch as it has pointed out that globalization of business and of R&D have been noteworthy developments in the fast-changing world and foresees "meaningful partnership in the international plane in the areas of mutual global interest... on the anvil,"<sup>28</sup> the resultant consequence would tantamount to technological colonialism in which Indian R&D and Indian industries would act not even as junior partners but as petty rentiers.

### **The High-Yielding Variety Technology**

What is instructive here is that all this is being done to bring about an industrialization traversing through an export-growth that has to be rapid enough to carry India into the 21st century. This is the theme that looks into the future, sanctions high growth-rates, seeks to generate investible surplus through demands derived from a consumerist culture, keeps the people numbed by the consumerist culture and technological fixes and is founded upon an agriculture as a bargain sector charged with producing cheap foodgrains to galvanize the wheels of industrialization of a society informed by an urban industrial vision.

It was this rationale that underlay the introduction of the HYV (highyielding variety) technology under the aegis of USAID, the Ford, and the Rockefeller foundations, and their institutional and peer group ideological linkages with their funded agricultural research centres in India. Although its impact in terms of rate of growth and sufficiency in foodgrains production had dramatically ushered in the green. revolution in India, the fact that technology-transfer presupposed an intimate knowledge of localized conditions-soils, climates, cropping systems and harvesting, processing and consumption patterns—it has disoriented the national research capacity. Thus one had seen research exclusively on the HYV package-high carbohydrate seeds, plant-breeding and genetics, the climatic zones and areas of assured water supply where they could be grown, and fertilizer-sensitive plants that could be protected from diseases only by chemicals. Concomitantly, there has been neglect of researches in a number of other fields the pulses and oilseeds, non-irrigated areas and dry farming practices, soil and water conservation practices suited to the tropical conditions, on the biological means of disease-prevention as opposed to chemical pesticides, suitable cropping-patterns dealing in alternate water-supply with nitrogen plants that could reduce dependency on chemical fertilizers.<sup>29</sup>

Such a form of agricultural technology is becoming increasingly nonsustainable. Thus there has been a general squeeze on the micro-nutrients of the soil-copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc along with the use of chemical fertilizers depleting the carbon-nitrogen-ratio in the soil and the use of pesticide affecting photosynthesis adversely. There has been the lowering of the ground water table because of tubewell and droughts. Finally, it has impacted on the nutrition quality of the masses, increasingly fed on the chemically stained food products on the one hand and protein deficient food items on the other (no pulses, oilseeds, etc.)<sup>30</sup>

#### **Pattern of Development**

The impact on the pattern of development in India has been extremely disarticulatory. It has spawned metropolitan enclaves of production and consumption, where the depression of wage-income growth by the use of capital-intensive technology have provided multiplied surplus to the dominant alliance of propertied classes to feed themselves on luxurious consumption that is internationally determined and where satisfaction of new artificial needs through an elaborate build-up have denuded potential investment for growth.

Besides, insofar as the success of the Green Revolution had been postulated only under certain optimum conditions-optimal irrigation, intensive use of fertilizers, monoculture (for the rational use of machinery and agricultural implements) and pest-control through chemical pesticides (also requiring monoculture), it has ushered in localized enclaves of capitalist farming in India. In this resultant disarticulation of the extant social organization, one sees both regional disparities and interpersonal inequality, accentuated further by the use of high-cost inputs-HYV seeds, fertilizers, tractors, harvesters, and tubewell-purchasable only by the rich farmers on the one side, with the growing unemployment and under-employment and increasing casualization and proletarianization of the small and poor farmers, sharecroppers and agricultural labourers.

More importantly, the bypassing of the local science and technology system has brought about a debilitation of the domestic R&D. It has choked off the masses from the production system especially when the large traditional sector is informed by empirical knowledge and has no institutional back up to improve productivity and its competitive ability.

# ❑❑ **Conclusion**

Thus far from ushering in socialism and self-reliant development, the science and technology policies have harvested inequity, injustice, and neocolonial dependency. And yet, such was logically incumbent upon certain historical and structural factors.

Historically, it was the very development strategy to which the Third World regimes were hooked upon. The impact of imperialism and colonialism, while causing deindustrialization and de-development, had also led to an imperialism of categories<sup>31</sup> in terms of examining a non-western concept and tyrannization of historical possibility, under-driven by an internalist model of technological development, implying that the technological futures of the non-west is the one in the west and that everything in the non-west is refractory, traditional and hence a barrier to the development, seen as modernization, as westernization. This gave way to the transfer of technology and the thesis. of technological leapfrogging, of the Listian strategy of technological development in which the 19th century Germany and the 20th century Japan were the models.

But such a strategy was basically flawed in that wherever it had succeeded it was founded upon (1) strong state, (2) dominance of capital over labour, (3) compensating nationalism leading to aggressive nationalism, and (4) fit between the structure and values encapsulated in the technologies of the supplier and buyer countries. But in a state that was ostensibly wedded to socialism and self-reliance and drew its legitimacy and autonomy from that, such a cultural environment for technological change was simply not there.

For, the very nature of the Indian state provided for a structural straitjacket. The reigning dispensation of the dominant alliance of propertied classes-industrial big bourgeoisie under the commanding heights of the metropolitan capital, rich peasants-landlords in the ambit of failed land reforms policy and the capitalist restructuring of the rural social organization of production, and urban middle class\professionals seduced by the mindset of luxurious consumption of goods selling under foreign brand-name influenced the pork-barrel nature to the political process. It effectively throttled the capacity, autonomy, and support for the developmental actions of the state, especially when both the industrialization through dependency based upon the technology-transfer, and export-promotion industrialization posited on trade, as has taken place in Japan and the Asian NICs, had rendered the adoption of certain critical policies imperative.

On the other hand, the forces of technological dynamism were blunted by the lack of organizational capacity for producing new products through the use of high technology and developed an indigenous capacity to assimilate and efficiently utilize such a technology. Given the feudal, monopolistic, and oligopolistic nature of the international technology-market, the high direct and indirect cost of the local technological capacity, the persistent predilection to the import of technology pushed India into a neo-colonial form of dependency.

The signing of the WTO has further paved the way for the invasion of the foreign capital, foreign trading monopolies and services, and foreign technologies (both product and process). On the anvil is not merely the subversion of the motifs of self-reliance, competitiveness and development of indigenous technological capability. But also and more importantly, when seen in the context of the rolling back of the state before the new presiding deity-the market-underdriven by the global alliance of capitalist class with their hanger-ons and rentiers, the very incorporation of the traditional masses, the very India into the global system of control, hegemony, exploitation and repression.
