# **State Politics in India**

*Mahendra Prasad Singh*

## ❑ **Introduction**

The study of provincial politics and native states in British India was an underdeveloped area. Native states,in any case, formed a backyard of the British Raj but politics, both constitutional and institutional, were largely eclipsed by the nationalist movement. In retrospect, constitutional reforms introduced in the first half of the 20th century in the British Indian provinces, by the imperial government of London, were significant in the early experiments of representative, responsible, and federal governance. Bolder moves structured in all these respects under the 1950 constitution, after India's independence, must be studied in this historical backdrop. There are certain missing information in studies of devolution of powers to the provincial governments under the Government of India Act. 1909 which can be observed in the studies of diarchy at the provincial level under the Government of India Act, 1919. and in the provincial autonomy of the first federal constitution in British India underthe Government of India Act, 1935.

Study of State politics, in independent India, also remained a rather under-cultivated field of enquiry which may be explained in terms of a number of reasons. Firstly, in the Nehru era there was a carryover of the nationalist ambience and fervor of the freedom struggle, and for this reason all that really mattered was the politics at the national level. Congress dominance at the Union as well as state levels submerged politics in the states under the overarching national patterns. Popular mass movements for the creation of unilingual states in various parts of the country during the 1950s and 1960s briefly brought federal and state politics to forefront, but once such demands were conceded, the leaders of these movements in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat tended to join or rejoin the Congress Party.

The overarching dominance of a single party was easily restored once again even in the areas of the linguistic regional agitations.

Secondly, the breaches in Congress dominance in the late 1960s and the late 1970s relatively lived for a short span of time after which Congress dominance was again restored. The emergence of states as important arenas of politics turned out to be rather brief episodes. The reigning eras of Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of independent India, Smt. Indira Gandhi, the third Prime Minister of independent India and Rajeev Gandhi, the sixth Prime Minister of independent India were characterized by a great deal of centralization or 'nationalization' of the Indian political system. State politics were then either a subsidiary arena or were appendage to national politics.

Thirdly, the distribution of powers and revenue resources in the Indian constitution is heavily skewed in favour of the centre. This feature greatly reduces the importance and effectiveness of the State Governments, and make them immensely dependent on federal mandatory and discretionary fiscal transfers under the constitution and shared-cost-centrally-sponsored schemes of development under the federal spending power. Notably the union and state jurisdictions are demarcated with at least some exclusive areas reserved for each order of government, but the constitution does not expressly prohibit the union government to spend its money even in exclusive state concerns.

Fourthly, even though the law and order is supposed to be an exclusive concern of State, there has been an enormous expansion in the central paramilitary police forces. The 42nd constitutional Amendment (1976) has made the deployment of armed forces and central paramilitary forces in aid of civil power in a state an exclusive union competence. Incidence of internal disturbances and terrorist activities by external and indigenous groups has resulted in a great deal of increase in the coercive power of governments and centralization in the political system. These developments tend to overshadow the State Governments and subordinate state politics to the imperatives of national politics, although the state governments are now very zealously guarding their turf against any new encroachments by the center.

It has presumably been for these reasons that the studies of politics in the states (as well as federalism with its focus on intergovernmental relations) have been less andalso sporadic over the years. The first major attempt in study of state politics was published in 1968 by Myron Weiner.<sup>1</sup> It made a selective study of only eight states: Uttar Pradesh., Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Jammu and Kashmir, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab. The focus was deliberately kept rather open-ended and wide, in view of the exploratory nature of the exercise, though the conceptual and theoretical concern reflected the dominant pre-occupation of the Western, especially American, scholarship of the time, emphasizing on the political aspects of modernization in relation to political and economic development. Methodologically, Weiner made a significant point, which says "Each of the Indian states provides us with an unusual microcosm and macrocosm for studying processes of development: a microcosm since the states are constituent units of a larger system, and a macrocosm because the units are themselves so large that they can be studied as total systems.... The states share a common legal system, a common constitutional framework, a common administrative structure, a common international environment, but their internal political patterns vary considerably."<sup>2</sup>

Weiner set a great store by this methodological advantage that the factors that are held constant in this quasi-experimental research design cannot account for states' variable political patterns and must be looked for in historical, sociological, and political economy factors. The author's writing on the respective states tried to explain the varying patterns of state politics in terms of the social and economic factors, such as why West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala had active communist movements while the others did not have why was the Central Congress party leadership able to impose a Chief Minister in Madhya Pradesh from outside but was not able to influence the choice of the Chief Minister in West Bengal and Madras, why was political participation high in Kerala, Madrasand Punjab, and low in Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Bihar why was factionalism in the ruling Congress party and fragmentation among the opposition parties more intense in some states than in others, why were some states more seriously afflicted by community tensions and violence than others, why did some states such as Punjab manage to register better economic development than others such as Uttar Pradesh. No overarching or systematic explanatory framework emerged from the separate state studies beyond the rather overstated methodological assumptions alluded to above, and the underlining of two crucial all pervasive factors of the dominant Congress party and the All India Services.

Myron Weiner, in his Editorial Introduction, candidly admitted that the volume is sought to measure political stability more than political performance. He also surmised that until then the states had not really played 'an innovative role in development. He went on to say: "Some powers constitutionally shared by the states and central government are exercised almost exclusively by the central government because of lack of interest or skill on the part of state leaders".<sup>3</sup> Under the veneer of political stability attributable to one-party dominance of the Indian National Congress, Weiner did point to the seeds of latent instability earlier. This was evident in the fact that even before the 1967 General Elections, in which the Congress lost in 9 out of 18 states, there were 5 states, Kerela, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, in which party competition was so intense that the Congress had failed in at least one of the 3 preceding General Elections to win a majority of seats and had either formed a Government with a plurality of seats or actually failed to form a Government at all.

The second and a more comprehensive academic foray (inclusive of 22 states alongwith a regional cluster of the North-Eastern states) in the field of state politics was made by a volume edited by Iqbal Narain in 1976.<sup>4</sup> Its antenna was conceptually and theoretically as wide as that of the Weiner volume and interpretations and conclusions were even less tangible. It made some interesting and impressionistic observations regarding the integration of the princely states into the Indian Union and the subsequent linguistic re-organization of the States, and raised the question, without really answering it, 'whether political remapping could result in organic political communities or whether the states or even their people continued to retain their pre-integration identities with their own sense of pride and prejudice.'<sup>5</sup> As to the style and idiom of politics, it hypothesized that the States were 'passing through a process of continuity and change which on the one hand symbolises in itself a gradual transition from tradition to modernity and on the other a syncretization of the two in a sort of modernization of tradition'.<sup>6</sup>

Since this volume was published during the wake of the restoration of the Congress party led by Indira Gandhi in the 1971 parliamentary and 1972 state assembly elections, following its traumatic defeat in 1967 followed by the great split in it in 1969, the editor could not help but raise the question whether the preceding debilitating events were just a short-lived deviant aberration. His answer was that "most of the contributors to the volume do not seem to subscribe to the viewpoint and they do not appear to be far wrong either."<sup>7</sup>

State politics in the 1970s and especially in the 1980s were revisited by a third significant volume covering seven states-Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat-edited by John R. Wood in 1984.<sup>8</sup> It succinctly analyzed the political developments during the periods of Indira Gandhi's Congress' ascendance during the turbulent 1970s, the Janata Party's Government interlude during 1977-79 and the return the Indira Gandhi's Congress in 1980 in the trail of the premature fall of the Janata Party Government. Wood in his editorial Introduction and Roderick Church in the concluding chapter highlighted the three different tendencies and trends in quick succession foundationally altering the parameters of state politics during the period under review in this volume:

- 1. The attempt of Indira Gandhi to centralize and personalize political power in her imperious premiership dominating the Union and State Governments alike by dispensing with internal party democracy, stamping out any dissent, imposing Chief Ministers in Congress-ruled states handpicked by herself and destabilizing opposition-ruled States by partisan use of President's Rule in States, under article 356, to suppress an extra-parliamentary mass movement against authoritarianism and corruption in the Congress governments.
- 2. The pluralization and regionalization of politics under the Janata Party governments in New Delhi and the north Indian states elected in the wake of the defeat of the Congress party in the 1977 general elections.

3. The recapture of political power by the Congress party in 1980 under Indira Gandhi and revival of her centralizing drive in the party and the governments at the Union and the states but less forcefully this time than in the 1970s. For the '70s were very different from the 1980s. As Church aptly noted in his concluding observations that the party was almost continuously in crisis ever since Indira Gandhi came to power on account of the participatory political rise of the regionally and locally dominant middle peasant castes. She did badly in the 1967 and 1977 elections, both the times followed by splitting the party in 1969 and 1978 to get rid of the dissident factions tarring them as representatives for the vested interests seeking to perpetuate the status quo. On both the occasions, she confounded her critics and political observers by winning hands down in 1971 and 1980,as new elections approached in 1989 with signs of her losing power again. Church mused whether there would be other emergency and undemocratic constitutional amendments like those in the 1970s to avert the defeat.<sup>9</sup>

Church's concluding piece, in J.R. Wood (1984), postulated an interesting hypothesis that political participation crisis of the lower castes/classes may help to classify Indian states into a typology of political regimes comprising the following four types of states, as in the early 1980s:

- 1. Upper caste/class dominated Congress regimes in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.
- 2. Lower castes/classes consequentially recruited into Congress regimes in Gujarat, Karnataka and Maharashtra.
- 3. Lower castes/classes strongly represented in non-Congress regimes in Kerala and West Bengal.
- 4. Competition between the Congress and a middle caste regional party, excluding lower castes/classes in Punjab.<sup>10</sup>

Atul Kohli in 1987 compared the differential effects of three different kinds of party regimes in three states on poverty alleviation policies and found significant variations among Karnataka under the Congress Chief Minister Devraj Urs, Uttar Pradesh ruled by a Janata Party coalition and West Bengal under the Left Front. The performance in terms of effectiveness in policy implementation was found to vary, in terms of Indian standards, from excellent in West Bengal, to good in Karnataka, and poor in U.P.<sup>11</sup>

Atul Kohli in a subsequent study focused on the growing crisis of governability in three states, i.e., slippage from political order to it's breakdown in Bihar, exit from breakdown to order in West Bengal and the growing turmoil in Gujarat, an otherwise relatively developed state. His explanation for these varying political trends was offered in terms of the decline of the social and political dominance of the landowning upper castes in the erstwhile Congress party, which was unable to incorporate the newly mobilized lower strata nor was any alternative party readily available to perform this task. Such a task could be accomplished only by a reformist party which simultaneously respected the rights of propertied groups, on one side, and ensure symbolic and real gains for the lower strata, on the other side. The Communist Party of India, Marxist led Left Front in West Bengal, managed to do it better during the period of this study, while Bihar and Gujarat were found groping for it with increasing levels of political conflict and violence.<sup>12</sup>

An exclusive study of left-wing State Governments in Kerala, West Bengal, and Tripura was undertaken by T. J. Nossiter and published in 1988.<sup>13</sup> By the time of this study the Indian communist movement and parties had come out from the orbit of the declining or disintegrating international communist movements and their national autonomy had become established. Indian communism had also made the switch to the thesis of peaceful transition to socialism in 1956-57. Yet the question remained as to what kind of communism had the Indian variant become-social democracy of early European vintage or Euro-communism of the more recent European politics. Nossiter found both interpretations offered in the literature, but seemed himself inclined to treat Indian communism in some ways sui generis or unique. Indian communism was constrained to adapt to the peculiar Indian socio-economic milieu and India's federal constitution and political system. Besides, the Indian communist parties seemed to have only adopted the practice of democracy as a strategy or tactics and not as an ideology or theory. In contrast to the communism in Europe, Indian communist parties never formally renounced the revolutionary path nor abandoned the dictatorship of proletariat in transition from socialism to communism.<sup>14</sup>

Regarding the Indian communists' attitude towards the use of governments, Nossiter delineated three phases of evolution:

- 1. The first communist government in Kerala during 1957-59 was cautiously optimistic but it was prematurely dismissed by Prime Minister Nehru;
- 2. The subsequent split in the united Communist Party of India in 1964 begetting the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the rise of the ultra left, prompted the CPI(M) to adopt the Leninist strategy of simultaneous pursuit of administration and agitation; and
- 3. A via media between the first two strategies by forming Left Democratic Front or United Democratic Front Governments depending on what is feasible in a state and trying to do the best under the conditions knowing it fully well that communists are in office not in power.<sup>15</sup>

After a more or less objective analysis of the three left-wing governments that are different but not spectacularly successful in comparison with other state governments formed by non-communist parties, Nossiter's succinct assessment is the following: 'In terms of performance, the three unequivocal successes of some or all of the Marxist-led governments have been: land reform rural local government, and minimum needs programmes in food, health and education. Significantly, each area is, more or less, within the state governments' competence under the Indian constitution and each closely echoes the demands of the developing mass movement. To a considerable extent, formal and informal popular participation-land grabs, *panchayats* and *zilla parishads*, and local party committees and locally recruited officials-has done much to energize the implementation of legislation and executive orders. The record varies as between the states.<sup>16</sup>

In a mega two-volume study edited by Francin R. Frankel and M. S. A. Rao, published in 1989 and 1990 covering a larger number of states across India, the authors sought to analyze politics in the Indian states from the theoretical perspective of the interface between social dominance and state power which underpins the competition among the old as well as new social formations for the capture of the state power in modern India.<sup>17</sup> Frankel projected the trajectory of this process in terms of three broad phases:

- 1. The coalition and competition among the political and social elites during the British Raj in the colonial and nationalist arenas of politics.
- 2. The extension of this process among the newly emergent elite-based alliances of the period of Congress dominance over the 1950s to the 1970s.
- 3. The further extension of this process to the voters' alliances at the mass level with the deepening of electoral democracy heralded by the advent of the Janata Party/Dal in the post-Emergency period beginning with the late 1970s and beyond.

Frankel hypothesized: "As Brahmanical legitimacy weakened, the potentialities for conflict within society greatly expanded. Simultaneously, the forms which these conflicts assumed became more varied according to the situational context and the regional pattern of social organization."<sup>18</sup>

In Hindi-heartland, the Congress thrived on the electoral alliances among the elite castes of the Brahmanical social order, but the competition among these castes created openings for the subaltern castes and minorities who were co-opted to leadership positions as junior partners who would subsequently become leaders in their own right with the deepening of electoral completion with the gradual political rise of lower castes and formation of alliances spanning Backward and Forward castes and classes. In Rajasthan, the Congress electoral strategy counted on the urban educated middle classes and Jat and Rajput peasants to mobilize against the ex-Maharajas and former Jagirdars.<sup>19</sup>

To the northwest, in Punjab, the Congress contended against the Akali Dal factions agitating for a Sikh-majority, Punjabi Suba and Hindu-based Bharatiya Jan Sangh. The states of western and southern India were dominated by subregional or state-wide dominant cultivating middle castes such as the Reddys in Andhra Pradesh, Lingayats and Vokkaligas in Karnataka, Marathas in Maharashtra and Pattidars in Gujarat. The Congress made these castes it's mainstay with all in complex alliances with urban upper castes and classes as well as scheduled castes and tribes and Muslims.<sup>20</sup>

In the extremesouth and the east there were no exact equivalents of dominant castes of peasants and farmers. In Madras, later Tamil Nadu, the Congress first relied on the Brahmans and Vellalas in the hinterland of the capital city and on the notables of localized cultivating castes. In West Bengal, the urban *Bhadralok* Congress leaders mobilized the villagelevel *jotedars* (cultivators) and intermediary peasant castes. In Orissa, the Brahman-Karna middle class Congress leadership entered into electoral alliances with rich peasant Khandayats and scheduled castes and tribes.<sup>21</sup>

John Harris<sup>22</sup> made an elaborate classification of state political systems around the turn of the century on the basis of caste/class power and the nature of organization of the party/parties in power in those states. He then offered causal connection between political regimes across Indian States and policy formulation and performance under them, especially with regard to decentralization of power to lower caste/class groups and poverty alleviation (see Table 1).

postulated relationship between the regime type and governmental policy performance. Harris concludes: "Where stable, relatively well institutionalized parties complete for their votes, the political system is likely to be more responsive to the needs and interests of poorer people, and more effective in bringing about poverty reduction."<sup>23</sup>

In a subsequent survey of research on the relationship between regime differences across Indian states and rural poverty reduction, Harris considered evidence and argument on both sides of the debate. He particularly took note of studies by Minhas, Jain, Tendulkar (1991), Datt, Ravallion (1998),Vyas and Bhargava (1995). The former analyzed trends in poverty alleviation in two phases, i.e., 1970-71 to 1983 and 1983 to 1987-88. They ranked the major states, taking into account both the changes in headcount ratio and absolute number of poor people across both the phases, as follows: 1. Andhra Pradesh 2. Kerala 3. West Bengal 4. Tamil Nadu 5. Madhya Pradesh 6. Uttar Pradesh 7. Haryana 8. Rajasthan 9. Bihar 10. Orissa 11. Maharashtra 12. Karnataka 13. Himachal Pradesh 14. Assam 15. Punjab 16. Gujarat 17. Jammu and Kashmir. Andhra Pradesh and Kerala registered reductions in both headcount ratio and absolute numbers in both the phases. The headcount ratio declined in the first phase than in the second in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Haryana and Rajasthan. Its decline was more in the second phase than in the first in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. After declining in the first phase, it improved in the second phase in Orissa, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Himachal, Assam and Gujrat. Conversely, it marginally increased in the first phase but declined in Bihar in the second. Jammu and Kashmir registered increase in both the phases. Harris finds these variations rather erratic, but notes that what appears to be significant is that the second phase is marked by the launch of a more comprehensive poverty alleviation programme featuring Integrated Rural Development Programme aiming to put productive assets into the hands of the poor, the National Rural Employment Programme and the Public Distribution System to supply essential commodities at a lower price to the poor. This was largely in place in the first period as studied by Minhas and his collaborators. Vyas and Bhargava (1995) reported later, which supports the above interpretation, that poverty ratio decreased only by 3 per cent in the pre-poverty alleviation programme period (1970-71 to 1977-78), whereas its decline was to the tune of a per cent in the poverty alleviation programme period (1977-78 to 1987-88).<sup>24</sup>

In a comparative study of politics across India's states edited by Rob Jenkins,<sup>25</sup> the contributors have presented paired studies of some aspects of politics in the states along the dimensions of economic policy-making (Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu by Loraine Kennedy, and West Bengal and Gujarat by Aseema Sinha); subaltern politicization (Bihar and Orissa by Sanjay Kumar, and Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh by Christophe Jaffrelot and Jasmine Zerinini-Brotel); civic engagement (cities in Uttar Pradesh and Kerala by Ashutosh Varsney, and Maharashtra and Rajasthan by Rob Jenkins); and political leadership (Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka by James Manor, and West Bengal and Tamil Nadu by Mukulika Banerjee). While the Telugu Desam Party's Chandrababu Naidu has implemented the neo-liberal economic reforms with greater commitment in Andhra Pradesh, the leaders of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) implemented the same policy with reluctance with the public posturing of distancing themselves from it in Tamil Nadu. Kennedy attributes this difference to the fact that Andhra Pradesh is less fragmented in its party system and comparatively less marked by politicization of the lower castes in comparison to Tamil Nadu.<sup>26</sup>

Aseema Sinha found that despite West Bengal being socially more peaceful and politically more stable, during the period, of study than Gujarat, the latter received twelve times more investment than the former. This difference is explained in terms of the prevalence of social democratic ideology in the eastern state and of the centrist or right-wing ideology in the western state. In addition, industrialization in West Bengal is concentrated around Kolkata where as more widely dispersed in Gujarat. This makes for a stronger support for neo-liberal doctrine in Gujarat than in West Bengal.<sup>27</sup>

On the dimension of subaltern politicization, the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are considerably higher than that of Orissa and Maddhya Pradesh. This has significant different impact on the party systems of the two sets of states. The ascendant backward castes in Bihar managed to dislodge the earlier dominance of the Congress party by helping the rise of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Janata Dal (United) (JD-U) in shifting alliances with upper castes, Muslims and scheduled castes. The same process is reflected in the decline of the Congress party in Uttar Pradesh, the failure of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) beyond a certain point, and the strategic emergence of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) with its core electoral base amongst the scheduled castes andthe Samajwadi Party with its mainstay among the backward middle peasant castes, both in alliance with other castes and communities. This kind of outcome is not found in Orissa. Sanjay Kumar explains it in terms of the fact that the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) which has replaced the previously dominant Congress party, is largely supported by the upper caste Karnas and Brahmans. There is no dominant backward caste in Orissa. The Khandayats have an ambiguous caste status and are ambivalent between the upper and lower castes. The scheduled tribes of the states, although sizeable, lack politicization and power. In Maddhya Pradesh, Zaffrelot and Zerinini-Brotel report, neither the backward castes nor the scheduled castes have been able to project parties of their own. The BJP and the Congress continue to run the show seeking to follow the electoral strategy of forging coalitions of extremes, i.e., upper castes and scheduled castes.<sup>28</sup>

On the dimension of civic engagement studied with reference to religious communal riots in selected cities of Uttar Pradesh and Kerala, Ashutosh Varsney comes up with the finding that the northern cities are more prone to riots and less able to expeditiously control them than the southern. This is on account of greater civic engagement, defined as inter-community contacts and reconciliation in contrast to mainly intra-community communication, in the South than in the North. Jenkins in his paired study of anti-corruption movements in two districts explain greater occurrence of such movements in these two districts rather than others, by the demographic fact of the cohesive community structure of one community structure of one particular caste in each of the two districts-Marathas in Ahmednagar in Maharashtra and Rawats in Rajsamand in Maharashtra. This type of community structure is conducive to the maintenance of cohesive social norms. It also precludes the political clash from degenerating into inter-caste conflicts. An additional factor that contributes to the above bahavioural pattern is that both the Marathas and Rawats have a sort of split personality resulting from their numerically large castes divided along caste-class nexus.<sup>29</sup>

On the dimension of political leadership, the contrasts are portrayed by James Manor between Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and by Mukulika Banerjee between West Bengal and Tamil Nadu. Andhra Pradesh parties operate in a more socially divisive locale than the Karnataka parties. That may be the reason why the national party leadership found it more feasible to intervene in the less socially embedded parties in former state than in the latter which are rooted in their own respective regional political cultures and socio-economic settings. In Trinamool Congress, Mamata Banerjee's political leadership is more mass-oriented, kind of Didi-populism than the elitist *amma-*populism of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam's leaded by J. Jayalalitha.<sup>30</sup>

In a recent study of Indian politics with bifocal coverage of national as well as state politics, Atul Kohli has offered an intriguing typology of the states with (1) neo-patrimonial political tendencies, (2) developmental political tendencies and (3) social democratic political tendencies.<sup>31</sup> At the national 1evel, the major change over the last three decades highlighted by Kohli is the growing power of the corporate business class in the political economy and processes, the exclusionary spiral engendered by this narrowing state-business alliance, and the political challenge of incorporating the excluded groups and classes to ward off the revolutionary politics. In seeking to explore the regional diversities in this phase, Kohli gingerly formulates the three-fold typology referred to above. His caution is evident in his disclaimer that India is no Congo or Zimbabwe, on one hand, and in his admission that the postulated types are mixed with redeeming features or possibilities of change, on the other.

Neo-patrimonial states of the Hindi-heartland minus Haryana and plus Orissa are generally at the bottom of the physical economic and human development indicators. They lack purposive, public-spirited, cohesive and robust political parties animated by civic regional nationalism or organized class politics. Their parties are mostly based on patron-client networks rooted in ascription and personal loyalties of the minions to the leaders, who routinely channel public resources to personal and patronage ends. Their bureaucracy is often politicized and venal. And the electoral cycle is often a vicious circle of corruption and criminality. This neo-patrimonial type of state is portrayed in some detail in a case study of politics in Uttar Pradesh.<sup>32</sup>

Developmental states of India such as Gujarat and Maharashtra in the west, Haryana in the north and Punjab in the northwest are historically reasonably well-endowed with a sounder base of economic and human development, and in some cases an enterprising agricultural class or industrial entrepreneurial class, in modern times. The parties and political leadership in these states may not be entirely different from those in the bulk of the Hindi heartland, but they are imbued with nationalism or regionalism and with a larger public purpose. Their bureaucracies are not as politicized and venal as in the neo-patrimonial states. Personalization of political power is not entirely absent in these states, it is somewhat balanced by governmental and political institutionalization. In Kohli's words, "These states not only mirror the national-level trend in India toward prioritizing growth and supporting private capital but are also beginning to perform some of the functions that one associates with the developmental states of Asia".<sup>33</sup> The developmental state in India is illustrated with a case study of the BJP-ruled Gujarat.

Kohli takes Kerala and West Bengal as the clearest examples of social democratic states in India, though he also confusingly and questionably brings in the ambit of his discussion the states of south India as well. Kohli contends that social democratic states are characterized by mobilized lower middle and lower castes and classes through well-organized political parties, "who are in a position to implement modest redistribution, adding an egalitarian bias to the growth process". In Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka similar socio-politcal mobilization is evident "insofar as Brahmanical in them was successfully challenged rather early on trouncing the power pyramid." However, the political parties in these states have mobilized the people on the basis of regional nationalism instead of class lines. Social egalitarian ethos is part of the political idiom but in the absence of class-based parties populist political leadership and parties have flourished. This model of state politics is illustrated by a case study of West Bengal.<sup>34</sup>

To my mind, Kohli would have done well to create a separate category for southern states as their indigenous anti-caste egalitarian political ideology is a far cry from either Marxism or democratic socialism or social democracy, all the three being different conceptual nuances.

Nevertheless, there has been paradigm shifts in the politics and political economy of India since the 1990s which have enhanced the role and autonomy of state governments, civil society and the market forces. The arena of state politics, in this process, has acquired an unprecedented importance. It might very well be said that state politics have really come into their own for the first time in the contemporary history and politics of India. Our study of state politics at this moment is very timely and topical.

## ❑ **Analytical Framework**

The analytical framework that we propose is developed in five components. The five overall factors are (1) democratization, (2) multicultural secularization, (3) federalization, (4) economic liberalization/privatization/ globalization and (5) sustainable development and characterizing politics in India in general and its states in particular. Our attempt is to pinpoint the variations in the ways these processes and factors manifest themselves in different states of India. We raise the question as to whether these variables or factors at the state level that may be accountable for the differential ways in which the foregoing crucial processes and factors unfold in different states. We also seek to ascertain the varying state capabilities that facilitate or ensure democracy, good governance and economic development. The five crucial dimensions of politics and political economy delineated here and the explanatory factors that affect their variability from state to state are partly mutually interdependent and partly reinforcing or in some cases contradictory. The state-level variations highlighted in this analytical framework are the dependent variables or factors that are in search of explanation. The overarching factors identified above are causal or independent variables that help us explain state-level differentials in political and economic performance.

## **Democratization**

Democratization refers to the process of increasing politicization of the masses in general and of subaltern classes or groups in particular through electoral mobilization and political participation. This process of democratization began to greatly affect the lower social orders by the late 1960s and has continued unabated since. Under the impact of this process, India's traditional and semi-feudal society is moving towards greater liberty and equality. Democratic politics tends to undermine caste and class differences and furthers the cause of political participation in elections based on universal adult franchise. Democracy is also imbued with the ideal of popular participation in the process of making a Government to the extent that it is practicable in a representative and republican democracy. Fundamental rights and directive principles of state policy provided in the constitution contain the ideals of a free and egalitarian civil society and state in India. The structures of governments outlined in the constitution at national and state levels are parliamentary federal and at the local level devolutionary. In addition, the 6th schedule of the constitution also makes special arrangements for autonomous district and regional councils within the tribal areas of of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram. The 5th Schedule makes provisions for tribes advisory councils for administration and control of scheduled areas and scheduled tribes in other states of India. These advisory councils consist of members amongst whom nearly 3/4th (but not more than 20) must be the representatives of the scheduled tribes in the Legislative Assembly of the state. The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments (1992-93), in pursuit of gender justice, ensure 33 per cent reservation for women in executive positions in Panchayats and Municipal Councils. In some states it is increased to 50 per cent, a move that is being contemplated by others as well.

The chapter on fundamental rights is one of the strongest in the universe of liberal democratic states in the world, with the possible exception of USA. The constitutional, legislative and judicial discourses on fundamental rights in India are very extensively and intensively elaborated. In the case law on the fundamental rights and directive principles of state policy, new dimensions have been created and added on to the rights and entitlements. The examples include the right to life, the right to live in human and healthy environment, the creation of the right to primary education to the children etc. The right to primary education was first created under case law and subsequently added on to part III of the constitution on fundamental rights by an amendment. An implementing parliamentary enactment also subsequently followed in 2010. Moreover, several new legal rights have been created under legislation, e.g. the right to information (2005), right to manual work in the rural employment sector in public works (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. 2005), forest rights to people inhabiting in those tracts (2006). A legislation guaranteeing the right to food (June 2013) is also presently being proposed by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance Government. Since 1993, we also have an activist National Human Rights Commission under a parliamentary statute. The mass media in India offers one of the most developed and independent democratic public spheres in the Third World, though the new trends of the menace of paid news, cross-media or multimedia oligarchic private corporate ownership patterns, political class floating their own media-all with serious consequences for editorial autonomy are causes for grave concern for the independence and integrity of the public sphere, crucial for deliberative democracy. Over bureaucratization has yielded place to a resurrected voluntary sector and non-governmental organizations, but these new developments are also not securely free from the menace of corruption and indirect bureaucratic colonization and control. Civil society vigour in India is more often seen in political and social movements than in the institutional domains.

Scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes (OBCs) have been granted reservations in education and employment or legislative representation for specified time frames under the constitution and/or law. There are also schemes for their economic and financial empowerment by the Governments at Union and state levels. Rights of religious and linguistic minorities have also been guaranteed by the constitution, supplemented by enabling and entitling laws and policies by Union and state Governments. Yet these noble intentions of the makers of the constitution have been vitiated by vote bank politics and brute majoritarianism and minoritarianism. Some landmark, in Supreme Court judgements on reservations and obiter dicta on discrepant majority/minority status in the states and the nation at large, have implied that the crutch is tending to be used as a stick to beat the system within a self-defeating way so far as constitutionalism or rule of law is concerned.

Party system is the vital link between the civil society and the state. No representative democracy can survive without a democratically constituted party system and social and political movements. Most political parties in India lack internal organizational elections. Personalism and imamoral familism are the order of the day. The oldest national party of the country and practically all regional parties are particularly vulnerable to this malaise. Corruption and criminalization afflict practically all political formations.<sup>35</sup> The legitimacy of popular movements in the face of governments and administration lacking in integrity, transparency and accountability is unquestionable. However, not a few social and political movements are mounted in pursuit of sectarian and selfish interests in disregard of public interest.

#### **Multicultural Secularization**

'To take the tack of multicultural secularization', the meaning of this term is the process through which ethnic pluralities of a society are brought into the public sphere for interaction and civic action in a spirit of tolerance and mutual respect. Firstly multiculturalism goes beyond the abstracted liberal individualism and assumes that human beings are culturally embedded in the sense that they grow up and live within a culturally structured world and organize their lives and social relations in terms of a culturally derived system of meaning and significance. Secondly, multiculturalism believes 'that no culture is perfect and has a right to impose itself on others, and that cultures are best changed from within.' Thirdly, in a multicultural perspective every culture is internally plural and reflects a continuing conversation between it's different traditions and strands of thought. It is important to clarify the relationship between secularism and multiculturalism in the Indian context. In Indian political thought, to name only two leading representative thinkers of modern India, Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi espoused approaches to the relationship between religion and politics that may be dubbed (1) secularist premised on the complete separation between state and religion in the Western revolutionary sense as in France and USA (Nehru), and (2) multiculturalist in the traditional Indian sense of equal respect for all religions-*sarvadharmasamabhava* (Gandhi). The Indian constitutional theory of multicultural secularism is built on a judicious combination of both these perspectives. The major premise of the constitutional theory in this regard is liberal secularism in the sense that most of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the constitution make individuals as the bearers of universal rights enjoyed by all irrespective of ethnicity, gender, place of birth, etc. Yet some cultural rights of religious and linguistic minority communities are also guaranteed to enable them to preserve their culture language and script and to establish educational institutions with certain legal autonomies. Moreover, the state is prohibited to collect any taxes for the promotion of any particular religion. However, there is no will of separation between the state and religion as legislation for religious and social reforms is not prescribed, although after the initial spurt of religious reforms such as the Hindu reformist code, the state has, for all practical purposes, left the constitutional ideal of a common civil code in splendid isolation.

It is for the foregoing features of the Indian constitutional approach to religion and politics that I think that it can best be characterized as multicultural secularism. It draws attention to the question as to how democracy deals with the phenomenon of cultural diversity, whereas in political theory it was earlier thought that the universalist conception of citizenship was sufficient to deal with diverse categories of citizens in a society. It came to be later realized that different blind laws with universal scope were incapable of erasing deeply engrained socio-economic disparities and discriminations. For these conditions differentialist conceptions of citizenship came to be argued for recognition of difference and differential affirmative action for creating a leveled playing field. Will Kymlicka and Wayne Norman (1994) have talked about three kinds of provisions and policies to deal with multiple diversities and cumulative inequalities, i.e., "special representation rights (for disadvantaged groups), multicultural rights (for immigrants and religious groups), and self-government rights (for national minorities)."<sup>36</sup>

## **Federalization**

Now, we come to the process of federalization that has gathered momentum since the 1980s, especially since the 1990s. The constitution of India combines parliamentary as well as federal features of Government. However, for about four decades after the commencement of the constitution the parliamentary features practically overshadowed the federal features due to one-party dominance of Congress and the charismatic and imposing leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, the first and the third Prime Minister. Federal features gradually gained ground over the 1980s, when non-Congress state governments were elected to power in one state after another and when Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi signed regional and ethnic peace accords with Akali Dal in Punjab, Asom Gana Parishad in Assam, Mizo National Front in Mizoram and Tripura National Volunteers in Tripura. The 1989 Lok Sabha election, in particular, greatly accelerated the federalization process throughout the country, when a multiparty system with federal coalition/minority governments was ushered in at the national level. In the new party system regional parties have gained considerable power at the cost of national parties that have been diminished, fragmented or have been unable to grow beyond a certain threshold of power. Led by one of the national parties like the Janata Dal, Bharatiya Janata Dal or Indian National Congress, federal coalition governments have been particularly vulnerable to the making and breaking power of the regional parties. Whereas regional parties accounted for 8.10 per cent of votes and 6.95 per cent of parliamentary seats in the popularly elected house before the 1952 general election, their corresponding shares have gone up respectively to 14.39 per cent and 27.97 per cent in 2009 General Election.

The federal phase has witnessed an unprecedented increase in the autonomy and role of state governments. Toppling of State Governments by the wielders of central power for partisan political considerations has been considerably contained. A new grammar of presidential, prime ministerial and cabinet working has developed in the era of coalition and majority governments. The president has acquired greater maneuverability in the exercise of discretionary powers, the prime minister must contend with powerful ministerial colleagues representing various constituent parties in the coalition, and the cohesion and collective responsibility of the cabinet to the Lok Sabha have become fragmented and stretched to extra-parliamentary centers of regional power. However, there has been an enormous expansion of the power and activism of the judiciary.

#### **Economic Liberalization**

The take the tack of economic liberalization and globalization: the chipping at the Nehruvian mode of 'Indian socialism' began in the 1980s but a comprehensive package of reforms in this model of state-directed economic development was introduced in 1991 to deal with a severe balance of payment crisis and recurrent losses in most public sector undertakings. By the end of the decade, state economies also faced a serious fiscal deficit that also necessitated neo-liberal capitalist reforms. Both Union and State Governments gradually embraced policies of bureaucratic deregulation of the economy, disinvestment or privatization of public sector undertakings, and globalization.

These economic reforms have augmented the scope of the private sector and autonomy of State Governments. Like the Union Government, State Governments are now also vying with each other to attract private capitalnational, multinational and global-multilateral-by offering better infrastructural facilities ('race to the top') or tax concessions and holidays ('race to the bottom'). India's annual rate of growth has considerably improved. The growth rate during the British colonial rule was a paltry 1.5 per cent. It was around 3 per cent in independent India before the 1980s. It moved up during the 1980s and jumped to upto 5 to 8 per cent since the neoliberal capitalist reforms of 1991. However, the problem with this development has been that it has been a jobless growth with negligible employment opportunities. It also lacks in distributive justice and inclusiveness. It has engendered a dual economy comprising relatively small enclaves of affluence, on one hand, and vast areas of abject poverty and destitution, on the other.

In his study of neo-liberal economic reforms India; in relation to democracy, Rob Jenkins<sup>37</sup> made the point that the policy regime change was made by stealth, violating democratic norms as the matter was not duly discussed in electoral campaign or in Parliament. Business liberalism replaced political liberalism bypassing democracy, so to say. The point more directly relevant to our present discussion here is the argument that the federal political structure of the country contributed to the success of the reforms. For federal division, powers were made to serve as voltage transforming sub-stations of the national power grid. The reforms at the centre sought to win support for specific dimensions of the reformist policy package by various State Governments, including the communistled Governments in West Bengal and Kerala by incentivizing them through fiscal and political measures advantageous to them. Centre-State conflicts were thus forestalled and inter-state rivalries were either played one against the other or diffused by federal power-sharing in minority and/or coalition Government at the centre. The reforms offered openings for all in the new political economy whose transition was made possible supposedly through democratic means—the avaricious political and bureaucratic elites, interest groups and pressure groups and demanding electorates. While hesitating to be definitive, Jenkins hinted at a new balance of political and economic forces and ultimately a new economic order and political policies.

Stephen Howes (2003)<sup>38</sup> focused on the problems of state level reforms directly in a study emanating from an international seminar organized by the India's States' Reforms Forum 2000. They argued that just as national level economic reforms were precipitated by a financial crisis of great magnitude in 1991, the state level reforms were pressed by a severe financial crisis in the States by the late 1990s. The relative uniformity of policies across the States prior to 1990s was in for a change by the end of the 1980s, both on account of political and economic transformations. Politically the party systems at national as well as state levels changed from Congress party's dominance to a variegated configuration of political power. The economic policy regime also changed from a socialistic welfare state in promise to one wedded to business liberalism. States found themselves on uncharted waters. States started to take leads in introducing reforms. The early straws in the wind came in the news of power sector privatization in Orissa, education guarantee scheme in Madhya Pradesh and organization of user-groups in management and distribution of canal irrigation water in Andhra Pradesh. The reforms spread to other states through contagion effect, increased quantum of state autonomy in the federal set-up and the sheer necessity of survival in the evolving Dravidian political economy. The states were forced to set their house in order both in terms of fiscal stability and better governance. Karnataka took the lead in 2002 to enact the first Fiscal Responsibility Act—an example soon followed by several states as well as the Union overnment. Other areas of reforms addressed were administrative reforms, including improving service delivery, curbing corruption and e-governance. Contributors to this study present informative overviews and case studies of numerous states, including the best practices from the West. The editors underline "the importance of seeing reforms at the state level as being about more than solving the state-level fiscal crisis, as urgent and deep as that crisis is. If the crisis is to be solved and if that solution is to mean anything to the people of India, far-reaching governance reforms will be needed to enable states to become agents of rapid economic, and indeed human development'".<sup>39</sup>

How are the states faring since the above study? While we do not have a comprehensive systematic study focused on state-level economic reforms available, things are not all too bad at the state level today. India's GDP growth has slowed down in the last few years (averaging 7.7 per cent 2009-2012). States, especially the backward ones, have surged ahead. In the years 2009-2012, the fastest growing states were Uttarakhand and Bihar (12.5 per cent each), followed by Gujarat (10.3 per cent), Madhya Pradesh (9.9 per cent), Goa (9.8 per cent), Maharashtra (9.7 per cent) and Jharkhand (9.2 per cent). Chhattisgarh and Odisha slowed to 7.5 per cent after averaging nearly 10 per cent in the preceding five years, trailed by Rajasthan (7.3 per cent) and Uttar Pradesh (6.8 per cent). Poverty ratio has also declined generally, but the absolute numbers of the poor remained stationary.<sup>40</sup>

A supposed effect of economic reforms is the enhanced economic freedom in the political economy of the states. Table 2 gives quantitative data on the overall economic freedom ratings in the states in 2011.

Economic freedom index, in a nutshell, is constructed by adapting the methodology of the Economic Freedom of the World Report to the subnational Governments in India and thus taking into account only the areas where the stable governments have powers under the constitution to impact conditions and institutions: size of the Government-expenditures, taxes, and enterprises, legal structure and security of property rights, regulation of labour and business. After calculating index for each of these dimensions, the values are aggregated to make a composite or overall index.

The authors report that economic freedom in the Indian States has increased even though it has declined at the national level. The median value of this index in the states has improved from 0.38 in 2005 to 0.41 in 2011. The improvement in Gujarat is phenomenal from 0.46 to 0.64 and this state has jumped from the 5th position in 2005 to the 1st position in 2011. However, some other states have regressed, the worst performer being Jharkhand, from 0.40 to 0.31. Bihar has a mixed performance moving up from 0.25 to 0.29, but still comparatively stays at the bottom of the Table 2.<sup>41</sup>

## **Sustainable Development**

In addition to the foregoing political processes relevant to public policies and governance, a more recent concern that has become increasingly salient is sustainable development. The term 'sustainable development' was formulated by the United Nations Brundtland Commission, which defined it as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs."<sup>42</sup> In standard scientific opinion, we stand at a historical juncture when we face the danger of destroying earth's life-sustaining capacity. Our attempts at preservation of our local, national, regional and global ecosystems are incipient and ineffective, given our outmoded notions of living, political economy, national sovereignty and international law and organizations. The imperative of Green Governance at the local level with challenges to livelihood, the national level with those of resource conservation and global level with those of greenhouse warming and climate change require a paradigm shift in the way we relate to the natural environment. An alternative mode of economy, natural rights and commons-based governance is called for, which is predicated on a philosophically pragmatic architecture

of environmental law and public policy, and possibly even de-growth and demilitarization.

Major environmental issues, in India today, are degradation of agricultural land and urban habitat, deforestation and land erosion, loss of mangrove and coastal land inundation, pollution and threat to public health, loss of biodiversity, extinction of wild life, resource depletion and loss of ecological sustainability and threat to livelihood security for the poor. A glance at Table 3 gives an idea of belated governmental legislative response to the problem. Except for the Indian Forest Act, 1927 enacted by the Central Legislature during the British colonial rule and copiously amended and adapted by State Legislatures in the post-independence period, all the other laws are recent federal enactments dating back to the decades since the 1970s. A separate Union Ministry of Environment and Forests was itself first set up as late as in 1985. A transition from the colonial extractive to post-colonial conservational approach to ecology and environment has been very slow even at the federal level. The response has been even more tardy and inadequate in the states of the Indian Union. In fact, the constitutional amendments relating to water pollution and wild life protection fall within the state jurisdiction but the federal legislations were undertaken by the Indira Gandhi Congress Government by prompting some State Legislatures to authorize the Parliament under article 252 of the constitution to make laws on an entry in the State List under article 249 providing for an enabling resolution by the Rajya Sabha (representing the States) by a two-thirds resolution of the members present and voting that such a law is 'necessary or expedient in national interest'. Other State legislatures can adopt those laws subsequently, and they have done so. A parliamentary law under article 249 is provisional or temporary but a law under article 252 can be amended or replaced only by the Parliament. Subsequently, the 42nd constitutional amendment (1976) transferred forests and protection of wild animals and birds from the State List to the Union List in the constitution. The same amendment also enjoined the moral duty on the citizens and the federal and regional States to endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wild life of the country (articles 48A and 51A-g). After the United Nations' conferences on the Human Environment held in Stockholm in June 1972 and on Environment and Development held in June 1992 in which India participated, it was realized that that a comprehensive framework of laws was necessary to cope with the daunting challenges to sustainable development. Under the constitutional and legal frameworks a number of Union and State autonomous statutory authorities, advisory councils, rules and notifications regarding environmental protection and ecological clearance of industrial, infrastructural, and governmental projects have been set up and framed. Some of these involve people's participation and consent at the local level. These laws often also establish original and appellate tribunals, subject to penultimate appeal to the National Green Tribunal or final appeal to the Supreme Court of India. The Supreme Court and the High Courts have been proactively engaged in addressing ecological concerns, often egged on by nongovernmental organizations and civil society movements through right to information and public interest litigation, on account of the failure of the executive and legislature and governmental agencies.

Ecological democratic or federal governance still awaits systematic empirical research worth its name in India. It appears that we still have a long way to go to have an effective Green Governance in place. The evolving policy formulation and implementation scenario have revealed growing tensions and conflicts along the axles of Union-State relations in the federal structure, political democracy and corporate capitalism, mass movements against industrial and infrastructural projects, federal regulatory authorities and Union ministries and the National Advisory Council of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) chaired by Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi and the Congress-led UPA government headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh (2004-09 and 2009-2014).<sup>43</sup> This was amply borne out by the unprecedented monsoon mayhem in Uttarakhand in the third week of June in 2013<sup>44</sup> which found both the National and State Disaster Management Authorities mapping.

The Disaster Management Act, 2005, makes provision for the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) chaired by the Prime Minister and a detailed action plan involving the Union Government, State Governments, District Administration and the Local communities in drawing and implementing disaster management strategies. However, the NDMA is still to classify disasters and disaster-prone zones in the country and streamline responsibilities at various levels and participation of local communities.

# ❑ **Variations in these Processes at State Level**

The political processes' policies outlined above have unfolded in an uneven way and their effects have not been uniform across the states of India. Democratic transformation in some states has gone ahead in comparison to others. Some states still continue to be largely steeped in tradition propped up by the hangovers of caste and tribal structures and semi-feudal economy. Some states are much more mired in social and electoral violence and recurrent conflicts than others. Citizens of some states enjoy better democratic rights and economic empowerment than those in others.

The same can be said about the process of federalization. Quantum of federal autonomy existent in various states is markedly different. This is not only because of asymmetrical federal autonomy granted to the states of Jammu and Kashmir Nagaland, and Mizoram by the constitution itself under articles 370, 371A. and 371G. The rest of the states of the Indian Union are federated in a symmetrical way with uniform constitutional status yet federalization process is marked by considerable variations across the states.

Very few systematic and substantive scholarly studies of macro scope of democratization and federalization are available in the existing literature on state politics. The situation is a bit better with regard to economic liberalization and globalization. Since the early 1990s, when these processes were accelerated, there has been a tremendous increase in regional economic disparities amongst states. Even newspaper reports project a parallel development of two contrasting corridors of economic growth and radical class violence. The Blue Corridor spans Delhi-Gurgaon/Mumbai-Pune/ Bangalore-Chennai on one hand and the Red Corridor stretching across the central tribal belt from the Indo-Nepalese border to the Deccan region on the other.

Social science studies also reveal that during August 1991 to March 2000 the states of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab and Tamil Nadu got proposals of private capital investment in the tune of 66.7 per cent as compared to only 27.4 per cent received by the states of Assam, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Differences in regard to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) are even more glaring. In the phase of globalization, only five states-Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu-got a disproportionately large 75 per cent of the FDI invested in India.<sup>45</sup>

# ❑ **Explanatory Factors for Variations across States**

How do we explain the differentials among the states of India on the dimensions of democratization, multicultural secularization, federalization, globalization and sustainable development? For this purpose, we may employ an explanatory framework comprising the following five factors: (1) geography and history; (2) demography, culture and social capital; (3) political economy with foci on macro economic sectors and class structure; (4) patterns of state party systems and social and political movements; and (5) the quality of political leadership with appropriate motivation and skill.

Does history and geography matter? Are there any perceptible or measurable differences between the formerly British Indian provinces and native Indian states or etween the border states and inland states or between the coastal rimlands and the Hindi heartland? The studies bearing on these questions would naturally be expected by historians and geographers. So far, studies of this inter-disciplinary nature appear to be conspicuously lacking in the literature.

Similarly, some states have dominant castes and communities whereas others have more pluralist and fragmented social structures. Some states are parts of the cultural mainstream of classical Hindu civilization whereas others are more composite in terms of multicultural fabric. Some states are multicultural whereas others are marked by ethno-nationalist movements and even separatism. Some states are endowed with greater degree of social capital measurable in terms of the vigour of associational, cooperative and corporate organizations than others. How far these differences, if any, are consequential for patterns and trends in state politics across the country? As the review of literature in a preceding section above suggests, the studies so far have mainly focused on the interface between caste and community and politics, largely in a compartmentalized way, within a state without much attention to regional and national linkages, with the possible exception of the Northeastern states as a region.

Likewise, how significant are the differences in historical patterns of the British land tenure system divided in terms of the *zamindari*, the *ryotwari* and the *mahalwari* subsystems? It is same with tribal and non-tribal land holding systems. Similar questions arise with regard to differences among the states in terms of their class systems and sectoral composition of the state economy. The same is the situation with differences in material and human development indicators. Apart from some historical studies of the land tenure system , much of the work form our conceptual and theoretical perspective is yet awaited.

Moreover, there are marked differences among the states as to the patterns of their party systems and social movements. Some have developed one-party dominant systems with continued re-election of the same party consecutively for at least three terms (e.g., Delhi, Gujarat, etc.), while others have two-party systems (e.g., Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, etc.) or a multi-party bi-coalitional system (e.g. Maharashtra, West Bengal, Kerala, etc.). Some states are more prone to the incidence of mass movements or sectarian movements than others. How consequential are these differences correlated with other dimensions of state politics? Political scientists have given considerable attention to this dimension as the survey of research above and the chapters in this volume illustrate. We have constantly reminded our contributors to view politics in the larger sociocultural and political economy contexts as well as deal suggestively with the local, state, regional and national political linkages.

Quality of political leadership at the state level is more difficult to conceptualize and operationalize in terms of measurable empirical referents or indicators. Yet there are some palpable differences, including some studies by scholars, of leadership styles of Digvijay Singh, Narendra Modi, Nitish KumarMayavati, Chandrababu Naidu, J. Jayalalitha. Mamata Banerjee, Sheila Dikshit. etc. Our survey of research, above in this Introduction and the chapters those follow this introduction, demonstrate this.

## ❑ **The Varying State Capabilities**

We have so far sought to describe and explain the patterns and trends of politics in the States of India in a general sort of way. Here we narrow our conceptual and theoretical focus to the crucial problem of state capability. This concept is defined as the ability of the Government to achieve the objectives it sets for itself. These objectives may be gleaned from the purposes of the social contract that brings a civil society and state in existence in the first place, namely, security of life, liberty and property on a universal and equitable basis. This is proposed as the first indicator of good governance. Other dimensions of goals of governments may be identified by scanning the constitution and laws, five-year plans, national policy statements, public policies, election manifestos, Governor's addresses to the state legislatures, budgets, legislative debates, Chief Ministers' and other intergovernmental conferences, etc. Since the paradigm shift to neo-liberal economic reforms in 1991, the State Chief Ministers and their Governments have acquired an enhanced role in state-level reforms with the diminished role of the State and public investment in the era of privatization and globalization, the State Governments must attract private capital-domestic and external-to ensure economic development. A bureaucratic state must yield space to a regulatory state. The host of independent regulatory commissions that have sprung up, especially since 1991, are still in their early stage of operation, and bristle with teething troubles. These problems mainly concern the question of their adequate autonomy from the executive, effective parliamentary accountability and insulation from the corporate capitalist sector.

The interventionist state<sup>46</sup> must transform itself into an autonomous and effective regulatory facilitator of development yet we must remember that even in this changed scenario in political economy of India, the constitutional mandate is for a democratic developmental state rather than just a developmental state in the mould of east Asian economies.

We propose to elaborate our concept of state capability in terms of good governance. Our index of good governance is operationalized by including the following indicators: accountability of Government to legislature and of administration to the people, human development, poverty alleviation, quality of regulatory regime for economy, rule of law and governmental stability. Performance of a state on these indicators may be measured by objective quantitative data wherever available, Or else, they may be assessed in terms of subjective intuitive judgment with some supportive qualitative evidence or argument. We must endeavour to go beyond mere description of the state of affairs explanations that carry persuasiveness.

It is pertinent to refer to a recent study of the quality of governance in major States of India by Sudipto Mundle.<sup>47</sup> Their index of governance is state-centric rather than straddling the interface between the governmental, civil society and market institutions-an aspect greatly emphasized in the neoliberal discourse emanating from the World Bank, International Monetary, Fund, World Trade Organization etc. While Constructing their index of governance on the three classical governmental institutions of the legislature, executive and judiciary, they measure governance performance on the dimension of a dualistic conceptual combination between authority (*danda)* and responsibility (*dharma*), using factual rather than perceptual data. They ranked 17 selected states variously using three different statistical analysis methods. We will selectively focus here on what they call the average of averages ranking. If we group their 17 ranked states into three broad categories–High, Medium and Low in terms of the quality of governance index-the picture that emerges can be viewed in the last two columns of Table 4.

In terms of actual data without any transformations applied to them, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Gujarat (in that order) belong to the High performing States. The Medium level of performance is registered in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Assam. The most Low' performing states are Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, and Jharkhand all except West Bengal is in the Hindi heartland. Notably, not all the 10 states in the Hindi belt are low performers, although not all of them figure in the study reported here.

The foregoing study also finds 'a positive but statistically weak correlation between the quality of governance in a State and it's rate of growth.' The authors go on to surmise that, "This is not surprising, because growth is presumably the collective outcome of several factors that are left out in a simple statistical correlation between quality of governance in astate and its rate of growth. Also growth may depend not so much on the quality of governance at a point in time, but the change in that quality over time".<sup>48</sup> Moreover, when the authors control for the effect of development on the quality of governance, it is found that some poorer states improve their rank on the index of governance. This implies that their governance' performance is much better than otherwise would be expected at their level of development.

The studies of state politics in the contemporary phase are too much preoccupied with the dimension of economic growth to the neglect of what is called above state capability in terms of a composite index of political,

economic and human development indicators. Even in terms of economic development, the existing studies need to come to terms with the emerging realities in an integrated way leading to a coherent bigger picture. For example, Francine Frankel argues that sustained growth rates of approximately 6 per cent from the mid 1980s contributed to the emergence of a consumer class and development of some sort of a national market, including rural areas. It also produced an information technology revolution related to the expansion of the service sector developing much faster than industrial and agricultural sectors, yet both these developments were confined to certain classes and communities and regions. This development led directly to growth without redistribution and inclusion and precipitated the slide towards the two economies 'a smaller, yet sizeable affluent economy growing up in larger cities and spreading to self-contained islands of export-oriented, high technology parks', on one hand, and 'the larger predominantly agricultural economy, of landless, marginal and small farmers, many belonging to historically disadvantaged lower castes, minority religions, tribal groups and women,' on the other.<sup>49</sup> Frankel also demonstrates the definite trend of increase in inter-state disparities, with Maharashtra and Gujarat showing the potential of replicating East Asian levels of annual growth in the 1990s; with Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal growing above national average; with Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa and even richer states of Haryana and Punjab experiencing a decline in annual growth rates, and Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka remaining more or less at the same level as in the 1980s.<sup>50</sup>

Yet by the end of the 1990s, we find a rather sudden transformation of the scenario of economic growth in Indian states, especially the supposedly backward states, often derisively called 'BIMARU states'. As India slows down in the wake of the economic recession in the US economy since 2008 and the nearly global recession in tandem since 2009, backward states of India move into a faster track of growth as already noted above. It is, however, important to bear in mind that there is still not much to write home about. For me , the acceleration in the growth rates are from a rather poor base while for another, it's sustainability cannot be taken for granted. We have still a long way to go.

Summing up, a study of state politics today is based on a classification of States by party or coalition in power would be a natural starting point but one must go beyond the descriptive plane to the explanatory and theoretical elevation and put these political configurations in their socio-cultural and political economy context. In terms of political parties in power today, Indian states are divisible into five broad classes:

- 1. Congress ruled states: Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Manipur, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka.
- 2. States under a coalition government of which the Congress is a part-United Progressive Alliance (UPA): Maharashtra (INC + Nationalist

Congress Party), Kerala (United Demoratic Front), West Bengal (until recently All India Trinamool Congress + INC which had replaced continuous Left Front government in the state since 1977 to 2012) and Jammu & Kashmir (J & K National Conference + INC).

- 3. BJP ruled states: Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Goa.
- 4. States under a coalition Government of which BJP is a part-National Democratic alliance (NDA): Bihar (Janata Party United + BJP), Punjab (Shiromani Akali Dal + BJP until recently, June 2013 for seventeen years).

States ruled by regional parties-Orissa (Biju Janata Dal), Tamil Nadu (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam), Uttar Pradesh (Samajwadi Party) and several states of the Northeast.

Contextualizing these contingent political texts of regimes, public policies and governance into their socio-cultural and political economy contexts-historically and contemporarily are: the major paradigmatic and theoretical challenges of political analysis in the study of state politics in India. Coalition Governments in some States In India have been pre-poll in their formation while in some others opportunistic post-poll coalitions are cobbled together. The former are more durable than the latter, e.g., Kerala and West Bengal. Indeed pre-poll coalitions in some states have survived for decades and registered a longevity better than such pre-poll coalitions at the national level-a clear indicator of greater political maturity, ideological and policy compatibility and purposive governance and enviable models of development. Even in the run-up to the 2014 parliamentary elections at this writing (2013), the Gujarat model of development *a la* Narendra Modi and the Bihar model of development *a la* Nitish Kumar are figuring more frequently and saliently than the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance and the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance models!

Coalitions also often straddle the electoral, legislative and executive domain. This feature underscores the complexity of the phenomenon of coalition formation in India than elsewhere in the world Electoral adjustments to reduce the vagaries or plurality or first-past-the-post (FPTP) system of electoral representation is a preliminary step of interparty coalition formation in India. These electoral coalitions may or may not directly and fully extend to the legislative coalitions on the floor of the legislatures with parties extending support to a Government without joining it nor is there an exact overlap between the legislative coalition and the cabinet coalition*.* The electoral coalition is wider than the legislative coalition and the legislative coalition is wider than the executive coalition. These complexities lend a greater instability to coalitional configuration of the government and opposition in India than, say in European political systems. There, the coalitions are often formed pre-poll and have greater durability and therefore greater stability of policy frameworks and functional governance. Since coalitional governance is likely to continue at the federal level in India and in some States of the Indian Union, a reformist reappraisal of the current state of affairs by the political class would appear to be an imperative. There is no dearth of ideas for reforms from political analysts and constitutional commission appointed by the governments from time to time. Acute instability of the earlier years at both the Union and State levels is now behind us. There is still a long way to go to ensure a more purposive governance and political and economic development. Party system reforms and electoral reforms are, in fact, begged more generally, not only in the States and the Nation where coalitional governance has become a recurrent feature but also in the States where two-party systems and one-party dominant systems (say a state where the same party is voted back to power successively for at least three times) are the prevailing pattern.
