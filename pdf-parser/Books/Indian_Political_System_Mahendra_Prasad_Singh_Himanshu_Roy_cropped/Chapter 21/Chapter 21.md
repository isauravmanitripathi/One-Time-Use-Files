# **Peasantry and Peasant Movements**

*Rajendra Singh* 

# ❑❑ **Introduction**

An attempt at presenting a working outline of peasant and peasant movements in India requires some initial clarificatory discussions on the conceptual meaning of peasant on the one hand, and on social movements, in general, and peasant movements in particular, on the other hand. R.K. Merton, an American sociologist, pointed out that in social sciences, "Too often, a single term has been used to symbolize different concept, just as the same concept has been symbolized by different terms". The people who make the conventional category of peasant, in the context of the contemporary rural scene in India, and elsewhere also, hardly constitute a relatively simple homogeneous rural scene in India, and elsewhere also, hardly constitute a relatively simple homogeneous and self-sufficient social entity. Consequent to the gigantic process of developmental changes in the countryside, the traditional notion of peasantry as a specific category of human population in history is under severe theoretic strain.

The objective life situations of the coastal population vary with those living in the mountains, and the life situation of the people living in mountains vary with the inhabitants of the plain regions. What are new are the emerging internal variations within any of the given three patterns of human settlements. Take for instance, the case of the peasantry of the plains. During the sixties decade of this century, scholars of the agrarian dynamics had made note of the emergence of 'model farmers' of Karnal (Haryana), the 'grape kings' of Maharashtra, and the mechanized farm and orchard owners of Bara Banki (Uttar Pradesh). The emergence of business-farmers with poultry farms, fruit, vegetable and spice producers, and even fisheries in the contemporary Indian countryside, mocks at the conventional textbook image of a peasant. In India, peasantry, if at all this term remains valid in its traditional meaning, now reflects an enormous internal variation in its economic practices, cultural styles, social organization, political aspirations, values, and behaviour. What are those objective social characters which help identifying 'peasants' as a distinct category of population? The question demands for a brief survey of the usage of this term in social sciences and the analysis of ground data which validates this concept.

The concepts of social and peasant movements, like the concept, 'peasant' also suffers from the surfeit of meaning. If one takes the pain of scrutinizing the senses, in which the conceptual phrases, 'social movements' and 'peasant movements' have frequently been used in the social science literature on the themes of collective mobilization and protest of people for and against some social values, the nebulous definitional character of these phrases could be made vivid. In the context of collective mobilization, we often come across conceptual terms, such as 'struggle', 'revolt', 'rebellion', 'uprising', 'insurgency', and even the use of the term revolution. These terms, otherwise carrying separate and distinct meanings from each other are found constituting semantic domains which often overlap upon each other and frequently get dissolved in each other. And the worst of all, anyone of them, or, all of them, tends to be treated as the serviceable synonym for social or peasant movements, depending on the nature of the context. The taxonomic and definitional meanings of these conceptual terms, in the theoretic discussions carry separate, specific and distinct meaning. Each of the above concepts is anchored to and is adduced from separate range of social data. The substantive status of the concept of social or peasant movements, therefore, requires a cautious analysis of this concept and its definition.

Finally, closely connected with the first two areas of referential or definitional problems suggested above, there also exists the problem of comparative methods of generalization and theory formulation about peasants and their movements. It is axiomatic that all peasant movements in social sciences are historical events and, therefore, their indexing and classification, comparison, and generalization are post-factum exercise in social science. The way peasants and peasant movements have historical dimension, they at the same time have and are embedded in social-space dimension also. Social movements emerge from and belong to a society in time and which has a territorial or spatial aspect.

How can the temporal and spatial coordinates of human society be combined and compared to provide for a theoretic ground for the comparative study of peasant and peasant movements in India? We shall briefly try to respond to these issues step by step, below. The purpose is to sensitize the situation of the conceptual confusion in the contemporary social science literature.

#### **The Concept of Peasantry**

"The systematic study of peasantry", writes Shanin "originated in Central and Eastern Europe", where search of national identity and the emerging political consciousness not only impelled the Westernizing political elites to face the question of the poor, but the social scientists also turned their attention to peasants. After sketching the various traditions and usages of the peasants as a social entity as reflected in the writings of scholars ranging from Krober (1948), Redfield (1956) to Durkheim (1960) via Vasil Chakov (1891) and Chayanov (1925), Shanin arrives at identifying four basic facets of peasants and peasant societies. These ideal-typical facets are:

# **Peasant Family Farm as the Basic Unit of Multi-dimensional Social Organization**

Family and farm constitute the fulcrum of social and economic life. Around these two, all other aspects of social life tend to be organized. Family labour is the only labour on the farm. The farm produces only to suffice for the family consumption and payment of duties to the "holder of political and economic power". The role of market and profit-making is as much ruled out as the impulse for capital accumulation and economic investment for further multiplication of capital. The image of peasantry is based on the fusion of not only family and the farm reflecting the merger of 'social' with the 'economic', but also on the relative insularity of peasant society. Its relative social immobility steeps the peasant society deep in the past and traditions weight heavily on it.

# **Land Husbandry as the Means of Livelihood Directly Providing the Major Part of the Consumption Needs**

Traditional peasants farming involves low level of task and tool specialization. Whatever task training is required, it is learnt at the family level. Conception of peasant family is relatively autonomous. Its basic fortune is seen to be in nature: famine, flood, and drought, or in a timely and sufficient rain. Peasant does not look at nature from the perspective of an artist, poet or a natural scientist, instead, in the peasants' eyes nature stands as the controller of bread and life. Nature carries an overtone of an enormous utility value for the peasant. For the peasant, nature is hardly an object of romanticist concept of beauty and aesthetics. Most of the learning takes place within the family. The elders of the family educate the younger generation on these matters.

# **Presence of a Specific Traditional Culture Related to the Way of Life of the Small Communities**

The system of values and norms are highly community-based. These are primary in nature. They derive their legitimacy and authority from the past standard and precedents. Peasant culture carries a specific meaning in terms of its simplicity, homogeneity and uniformity of values, rules and regulations in the community. Peasant culture, therefore, generates and sustains

conformist behaviour among its members and groups. Most of the peasant societies are repetitive societies and reflect perpetration through replication. Social mobility and change are relatively slow. The archetypal image of peasant society is of the 'non-changing' society.

## **Underdog Status—The Domination of Peasantry by Outsiders**

This aspect of peasantry refers to its subordinate position in the society. Peasantry as a social entity has been distant from the sources and seats of power and authority. Peasant's social, political, and economic subjection is linked with the exploitative practices of the superlords who imposed exactions in the form of rent, tax, and interest on the peasant. It may be pointed out that it is perhaps this type of subordinate existence of the peasant that led scholars to assign passivity, apathy, and a sense of resignation to the peasant, who could not muster courage to protest against exploitation. Karl Marx, the failed god of class revolution, too, sneered at the peasant and dubbed them as 'sack of potatoes'.

In essence, Shanin's definition of peasantry would refer to the following: The peasantry consists of small agricultural producers who, with the help of simple equipment and the labour of their families produce mainly for their own consumption and for the fulfilment of the obligation to the holders of political and economic power of the time.

The summation of the above four facets of the attributes of peasant and peasant society reflected in the above definition highlights more of the empirical life-situation of pre-modern rural folk, especially of Central and Eastern Europe. This definition mayor may not hold true and speak for the rural folk of modern and modernizing societies of the contemporary world. Prof. A.R. Desai aptly observes that such a construction of peasant and peasant society does not clearly:

"Reveal the qualitative impact and differentiation that takes place in the agrarian arena, as a result of capitalistic system through an expansion of the market, changed objection of production, commercialization, introduction of capitalist type of private property in land resulting in the vital process of differentiation within the agrarian population resulting in the emergence of rich, middle, and poor peasants, a massive process of pauperization and proletarianization creating a qualitatively new category of agricultural proletariat...."

The emerging country-town nexus, introduction of capitalistic mode of agricultural production, market relation, increased mobility of rural population and communication, and above all, the active participation of the rural population in the sharing and shaping of the power of the state-are some of the general processes operating in most of the Asiatic rural societies. These processes foretell the doom of the image for the idealized rural folk and the pristine simplicity of the village life. Have the contemporary villages of India retained their villageness? Are there peasant communities in the Indian countryside? Answer to such questions by the sheer force of academic inertia, generally, would be in the affirmative, but is always in negation to the version of peasantry outlined by Shanin. Villageness of the North-Indian villages, as depicted in Munshi Prem Chand's novels or the image of peasantry of the 19th century Tzarist Russia portrayed in the novels of Maxim Gorky or in the description and analysis of A.Y. Chayanov's theory of family farm economy, by and large, seems to be the social realities of the past.

The concepts of the *'gemeinschaft'* and 'mechanical solidarity' articulated by F. Toennies (1955) and Emile Durkheim (1960), respectively, to characterize the relatively undifferentiated, simple, and homogeneous communities approximating closely to the traditional conception of peasant society hardly hold true to the current social data of the countryside. Daniel Throners' *The Shaping of the Modern India (1980)* attests to the fact of the total or near eclipse of the conventional version of the rural or peasant communities.

On account of the accelerated social structural differentiation, mobility, and change in the system of power and economy, Indian scholars of peasant and peasant movement, instead of applying the concept of peasant and peasant society to the community aspect of the rural population, tried to 'sample-out' peasant from the differentiated, hierarchical, and inequalitarian structure of the changing rural society. This tendency is observed in the writings of a number of Indian scholars.

Following the principle of *exclusion* and *inclusion,* I have tried to construct the working concept of peasant by first, excluding the following two sections of the rural society:

- 1. The erstwhile rent and tax collecting class of the *ex-rajas, talukdars,*  and *zamindars* who were, generally, related to the peasant because of land ownership rather than by productive relation.
- 2. The class of traders who live mainly by trading rural commodities rather than keeping direct involvement in land and agriculture.

The local equivalent of the term 'peasant' is *kisan* and *khetihar mazdoor* in Uttar Pradesh.

Residually, I arrive at the following categories of agrarian population as suggestive of constituting the peasantry in North India. These are:

- 1. All the ex-tenant cultivators who held subordinate land proprietary right before the abolition of *zamindari* systems in Uttar Pradesh.
- 2. All the *khetihar mazdoor* (agricultural labourers) who have either too small land holding or no land at all and have to work on other's land or on daily wage.

- 3. The village artisans who get a share in the agricultural crop on the basis of the local norms of *jajmani* system.
- 4. Finally, the category of *peasant/kisan* includes all the pauperized and proletarianized section of *zaminadars* and *talukdars* who have suffered a loss of land ownership abolition of *zamindari system* in several states.

It is noteworthy that all the above indices for exclusion or inclusion in the category of peasant are only suggestive in nature. These categories of rural population are subjected to rapid change. In fact, with the loss of peasant as a specific type of social formation, that is, *peasant community* or *peasant society,* search of peasantry in the highly differentiated, hierarchical, economically unequal setting of current rural scene, where markets, banks, post-offices, doctors, telegraph, etc., are now in a state of rapid expansion. These days, peasantry, in India, is a metaphor; it is not a social reality of the contemporary rural society.

# **Structure of Social Movement**

Since peasant movement, in this article, is treated as a specific type of the generic concept of social movement, let us first, elucidate the concept of social movement. While it is a generally accepted fact by the scholars that social movements refer to the data of social change, there is no need to separate the fact of the concept of social change from those of the movements. In this respect, the following contrasting points can be made explicit for comprehension of the concept of social movement:

- 1. Social change is ubiquitous, universal, and all embracing facet of social realities; social movement is not a universal and overreaching concept. Social movement in its manifest expression could be of a sudden, dramatic, and episodic nature.
- 2. The birth, maturation, reutilization, and even the failure and end of a social movement can be described in the same way we describe the biography of a person. While social movements have a career in history and society, social change, on the other hand, cannot be described in the terms of a temporal limit of a biography or a "career". Like the concept of time, the notion of change is an ontological continuum.
- 3. Social change may or may not be the causes and the consequences of a deliberate and conscious effort of an organized collective social activism of the people. On the other hand, all social movements signify and express a relatively well-structured activism of the people which is deliberately and consciously organized.
- 4. Finally, every social moment carry a critical core, that is, some values, norms and even social practices prevalent in a society. At the beginning

of the movement, these are considered as oppressive, unjust, and unethical. Therefore, these are unacceptable to a group of people. On the later stage, struggle takes place for overthrowing and rejection with allegation of unjust and unoppressive values, norms, and practices. The social movements revolve around conflicts. These always remain in negation 'to' and 'for' something. A social change, unlike a social movement, may or may not carry a critical core in it.

Despite an optimum degree of overlap of the concept of the social change on the concept of social movement, the above four areas of differences are helpful in articulating a separate domain of social movement studies as a special field of social science theorization research.

## **Defining Social Movements**

After completion of the task of bifurcating the concept of social movement from the broad and generic concept of social change, we now proceed to present an elucidation and analysis of the concept of social movements. In this process a ground for a similar exercise of peasant movement is prepared.

It may be recognized right at the outset that the conceptual roots of social movement studies lie deep in the classical tradition of 'crowd' and 'group mind' studies of Lebon Tarde, McDouggal, etc., in social psychology, and in the study of 'herd behaviour' of animals at the time of peace and crisis and also in the Brinton's (1938) study of *Anatomy of Revolution,* and in many such works. The study of 'collective behaviour' as a domain of social science inquiry provided direct context for the emergence of social movement studies in social sciences. In addition, one can also see a shift in the theoretical emphasis and explanation of the concept of society and its relation with the *individual* and groups from an *organacist-functional* perspective to that of dialectical and *oppositional perspective.*

The rather simple and preliminary attempt to situate the concept of social movement at a point in the theoretic evolution of conceptualizing group behaviour is only suggestive and is presented to give a peep in the antecedents of this concept.

Heberle defines social movement as "collective attempts to reach a visualized goal, especially a change in certain social institution. He treats social movement as constituted in social collectivity. Heberle, further separates movements from "social trends", 'tendencies' and 'cultural changes' which are merely "the aggregate effect of many individual actions". Finally, he observes social movements as groups in the process of becoming organized. He states, "The main criterion of social movement is that it aims to bring about fundamental changes in the social order". Wilkinson (1971) defines social movement as "a deliberate collective endeavour, to promote change in any direction and by any means not excluding violence, illegality, revolution or withdrawal, into utopian community", it "must evince a minimal degree or organization, though it may range from a loose, informal or partial level of organization to a highly-institutionalized and bureaucratized movement and the corporate group". Wilkinson further states "A social movement's commitment to change and the *raison d'eire* of its organization are founded upon the conscious volition, normative commitment to the movement's, aims or beliefs, and active participation on the part of the followers or members". Before we identify some of the unique and general features of social movements reflected in the definitions of Heberle and Wilkinson, it is worthwhile to present a more inclusive, clear, and systematic definition given by Turner and Killian. They defined social movement as "a collectivity acting with some continuity to promote or resist a change in the society or group of which it is a part".

We can derive the following basic and consistent features of social movements.

- 1. The existence of a system of shared values, objective, and aspirations collectively cherished by a section of population of society or group. These values may function sometimes as myths and utopias and attain enormous ability to mobilize the adherents of the movement.
- 2. The shared values and objectives must be sustained and reinforced by a justificatory or 'rationalizing' system of *ideology.* According to Killian, in the context of social movement, ideology consists of typically four parts: (1) a version or a vision of history emphasizing the fact that goals of movements are in tune with tradition of society; (2) a projected wishful image of future or an imagery of paradiseattainable after the success of the movement. For an instance, during the freedom struggle movement in India, the idea of *Ram Rajya* was frequently used to portray the wishful image of Indian society after the independence; (3) the acute urgency for the success of the movement is dramatized by inculcating the fear of misery among the followers if the movement fails; and (4) the conception of "martyrs and heroes" as opposed to the villains or Judas of the movement. Suffering and dying for the cause of the movement is exalted. These four aspects of ideology generate an intense and heightened emotive action in the behaviour of the participants, who constitute the mobilization force of social movements.
- 3. A collective sense of membership of and participation. The membership notion infuses in the participants a sense of 'identity' with the other participants. The participants feel being on the "same boat" and develop a strong sense of belongingness with the members of the collectivity. The 'we-ness' of those who are part of the collectivity as opposed to those who make up the opponents or adversary group emerges from such a notion of membership of the collectivity. The fusion of the dispersed

individuals into a "solidarity group" of the collectivity as a solid human entity upholds the ideology of the movement and struggles for the realization of the collective goals. It is this fusion of the individual into the collectivity that gives the idea of the initiatives and of what Eric Hoffer (1951) calls the "brotherhood" of the "true believers."

- 4. A system of shared norms about the behaviour and action of the members of the group. The rules and regulations of the group not only define the general orientation of the members towards their own group, but also towards those who belong to the other groups. The "other group" may represent the opposition or the adversary group. The commonly agreed upon system of norms may range from an amorphous (often in the beginning of the movements) ad-hoc rules to a system of elaborate and stable rule of conduct.
- 5. The structure of the collectivity, that is, the group which is mobilizing itself to achieve certain values has to develop: (1) a division of members into leadership and followership and then, into other sub-groups, depending upon the requirement of the movement. The leader behaves as the 'torch-bearer' and shows the "correct-path" to the followers. He is often a populist demagogue, who promises earth to the participants, defines the tactics, and the strategies of the movement; (2) a system of communication which links the participants with the leaders. The communication methods may include, in the relatively less literate societies, the use of sound-making drums, symbols, songs along with oral transfer of commands, and the messages. Among the literate societies, however, written communication is generally in use. Modern means of communication with an advance technology is being used by the contemporary leaders of various movements taking place around the world.

After having analyzed the concept of social movement and its basic salient features, we now proceed to focus our attention to examine the nature of peasant movements, in general, and the Indian peasant movements, in particular. A few contextual points ought to be made explicit at the outset. Some aspects of social movement, such as the problem of their classification, their genesis and impact on social structure at large have been deferred at the present in favour of taking up these issues after the nature of peasant movements have been analyzed.

At present, to repeat again, it would be helpful to note that peasant movements are a specific type of movements of the *generic* concept of social movement. The specificity of peasant movement is highlighted by the fact that it, generally, arises and revolves around the question of *land control* and demands for *ownership of land* and share in *land produce,*  including control over and share in natural resources, such as water and *forest timber.* Second, in the social science literature, peasant movement is generally referred to as, *agrarian movement, land struggle, rural protest*  and *uprisings.* We are going to employ these significant conceptual terms to describe peasant movements, though the phrase "agrarian movement" could have been empirically more authentic in comparison to "peasant movement". Here, on account of the paucity of space, it is sufficient to recognize the existence of a theoretic tension (as suggested earlier in this chapter) in respect of the relevance of the continued use of the term 'peasantry', even though its supportive empirical base seems almost eroded.

Further, in order to situate the theoretic status of peasantry as the largest segment of human population in the intellectual tradition of social science thinking and also to point out the way these tradition treated peasantry as either as passive or active agents of social, economic, and political changes, including the peasant's potential to bring about radical and revolutionary overthrow of the social system of a time, we shall present a brief account of the classical Marxist and neo-Marxist views on peasantry. By classical Marxism, I refer to the writings of Marx.

#### **Peasant and Peasant Movement in the Marxist Tradition**

For Karl Marx, the agents of the eventual revolutionary overthrow of the capitalist order of society did not reside in the countryside; they were not the soil-bound tillers of patches of land. Instead, it were the city-based industry and factory workers (i.e., the proletariat), who, after dissolving all the social and emotive bonds that enmeshed the peasant in the countryside with false contentment, were to establish the socialist order of classless society. It were these urban industry and factory-based workers who, according to Marx, were the heroes of history and it was on to them that Marx hitched the destiny of history, that is, the promise of equality among men not in heaven, but on the earth.

One of the greatest minds of the 19th and 20th centuries, Marx was also one of the prominent utopians of the period. The other two who could be ranked parallel to Marx in terms of their intellectual impact on the modern man are Charles Darwin and Sigmund Freud.

Marx sneered at the peasants for the absence of revolutionary potential in them and dubbed them as a sack of potatoes. Writing about the French peasantry Marx states:

"The small-holding peasants form a vast mass, the members of which live in similar conditions, but without entering into manifold relations with one another. Their mode of production isolates them from one another instead of bringing them into mutual intercourse. Their field of production, the small-holding, admits of no division of labour in its cultivation, no application of science, and therefore, no diversity of development, no variety of talent, no wealth of social relationships. Each individual peasant family is almost self-sufficient; it itself directly produces the major part of its consumption and thus acquires its means of life more through exchange with nature than in intercourse with society. A small holding, peasant and his family; alongside them, another small-holding, another peasant and another family. A few score of these make up a village, and a few score of villages make up a Department. In this way, the great mass of the French nation is formed by simple addition of homologous magnitudes, much as potatoes in a sack form a sack of potatoes".

On account of the nature of their objective existence, Marx found the peasant totally incapable of forming a "class".

"They are consequently incapable of enforcing their class interests in their own name, whether through a parliament or through a convention. They cannot represent themselves, they must be represented. Their representative must at the same time appear as their master, as an authority over them, as an unlimited governmental power that protects them against the other classes and sends them rain and sunshine from above"*.*

This passive and resigned majority section of human population making the peasantry in Marx's own writings is visible only in its event lessness and as an insignificant social data of history. In the stride of such thinking that Marx presents, the famous, but the most contemptuous portrayal of peasantry of the Indian village communities, he states:

"We must not forget the barbarian egotism which, concentrating on some miserable patch of land, had quietly witnessed the ruins of empires, the perpetration of unspeakable cruelties, the massacre of the population of large towns, with no other consideration bestowed upon them than of natural events, itself the helpless prey of any aggressor who designed to notice it at all. We must not forget that this undignified, stagnant, and vegetative life, that this, passive sort of existence, evoked on the other part in contradiction, wild, aimless un-bounded forces of destruction, and rendered murder a religious rite in Hindustan" (*New York Daily Tribune:* 25th June 1853).

The citation of the two rather large passages from Marx's writings on nature and role or (non-role) of peasantry in history are amply suggestive. In Marx's materialistic paradigm of society and history, of classes, class struggles and class revolution, peasantry is conceived as a useless social appendage devoid of an ability to stand on its own feet, speak its own language, articulate its own problems and issues or even to look at its own image in the mirror of an objective life-situation of an utter sub-ordination to and consequently, of its exploitation by the superior power of their lords and masters. This faceless social entity in Marx's thesis of class revolution is a non-entity.

Marx, however, could not recognize the ability of the peasant to organize, identify the situation of exploitation, hold the class responsible for its misery, and finally, its ability to give a lethal blow to the system of exploitation. Not only Marx, but his followers of different shades and varieties, together referred as the neo-Marxists, however, did recognize the peasant's potential for organizing, mobilizing, and revolting against the oppressions of the masters and the lords. This urgent and fighting face of the peasantry is reflected in the writings of Lenin (1970), Mao (1954), Fanon (1974), etc. In the case of the Indian scholars of neo-Marxist tradition, P. Sundarayya (1972) and Sunil Sen (1971) are two bright examples.

In relation to the peasantry and to the peasant's potential for revolt and rebellion, the major theoretic departure of the neo-Marxists from Marx is seen around three crucial modifications of the classical Marxist thesis. We summarize these modifications as follows:

- 1. In the ideological writings of the neo-Marxists, peasantry attains the status of a class; it is found capable of possessing "class consciousness". The successful role of peasant in the Russian and Chinese revolutions, under the leadership of Lenin and Mao, respectively, validates the neo-Marxist conception of peasantry as a revolutionary class.
- 2. By assigning the class-status to the peasants, the neo-Marxists retrieved the peasants from their projected perennial passivity and as such, from their perceived image of historical insignificance in the making of society and history contrary to the way Marx had perceived and projected the peasants.
- 3. Finally, the neo-Marxists transformed the classical Marxist science of political economy into an ideology of mobilization, protest, and revolt. The neo-Marxism catalyzed the peasantry's potential to revolt against and reject the system of injustice and exploitation. No wonder that most of the peasant wars of the 20th century reflected the impact of the revolutionary ideology of neo-Marxism in peasant mobilization across different societies. In India, Naxalism and its continued mobilization of peasants in some parts of the country, affirms the points noted here. The departure of the neo-Marxists from the classical Marxism in respect to the peasants, therefore, was a great theoretic departure. This was a great ideology also.

The assertive appearance of angry peasants on the agrarian backdrop of protest and conflict against the perpetuation of a grossly inequalitarian and exploitative rural social order was and continues to be backed and supported by the neo-Marxist ideological conceptions. No wonder that many of the peasant uprisings took place in the 20th century India, including the peasant uprising in Telengana (1946-51), Tebhaga in Bengal (1946-47), and Naxalbari revolts which began in 1967 and continues to be a force to reckon with are illustrations of the mobilizing potential of the neo-Marxist ideology.

After studying the peasant in the Marxist thought, let us briefly discuss the issue of peasant movements.

#### **Structure of Peasant Movements**

Shanin writes, "The last few years have seen a somewhat paradoxical rediscovery of the peasant. In our rapidly expanding world, the character, livelihood, and fate of massive majorities in most explosive areas have come to be seen as one of the most crucial issues of our time". The ability of peasant to organize, identify people, and principles of society responsible for the sub-ordination and exploitation, and further, to name the 'enemy', to heap blame on and hold them responsible for the peasants' abject lifesituation, and to demand for a remedy in the various parts of the world have been studied by scholars. In India, there are references to peasant uprising during the Mughal era.

Historically, it is noted that the incidences of peasant revolt increased with the increasing rate of peasant politicization. The frequency of peasant uprisings in the various parts of the Indian society seems to be denser around and after India's Independence in 1947 than the past. The revolt of the peasantry in Telengana during 1946-51 (Sundarayya, 1972; Dhanagare, 1983: 180-212; Ranga Rao, 1984; 149-68), Tebhaga in Bengal during 1946-47, Naxalbari which began in Bengal in 1967 and spread over other parts of the country, Nijai *bol* of 1946 and land-grab movements of 1970 and numerous other reportings on peasant uprisings give support to our observations. Let us now attempt at defining peasant movements.

#### **Defining Peasant Movement**

Treating 'social movement' and 'peasant movement' as synonym for each other, Kathleen Gough examines and discusses social movements among the peasantry. She defines social movement as "the attempt of a group to effect change in the face of resistance", and peasants as people, "who engage in agricultural or other related production with primitive means and surrender part of their produce or its equivalent to the landlords or to the agent of the state". Social movement of peasants, therefore, according to Gough, refers to those movements, which: (1) involved peasants as the sole or main force; (2) are class struggles against those who exact surplus from the peasants; and (3) as the result the peasants undertake or are provoked to armed struggle in the course of their career". Though peasant movements are an expression of a rather broad and generic concept of social movements, yet there is a need to introduce some classificatory system to separate peasant movements from the general domain of social movement studies. Clarity of concept is the hallmark of the clarity in the comprehension of the social reality.

For Dhanagare, 'peasant movement' and 'agrarian movement' are blanket terms which refer to "all kinds of collective attempts of the different strata of the peasantry either to change the system, which they (the peasant) felt was exploitative, or to seek redress for a particular grievance without necessarily aiming at overthrowing the system. Dhanagare treats 'peasants' movement' and 'agrarian movement' as two interchangeable concepts. We have suggested earlier that the term 'peasant' came into use to capture the empirical social reality of the pre-revolutionary Russian rural life or of the life-style of the Central and Eastern Europe's traditional rural folk. It may be emphasized that peasants and *peasantness* was seen (as we have discussed earlier) in terms of its being a relatively simple, *undifferentiated, homogeneous* and *self-suficient* community. The movement, when one introduces the notions of "strata", as Dhanagare does, the conceptual meaning of the term peasant tends to suffer an erosion of its traditional meaning.

In order to avoid such difficulties, I tried to define peasant movement as "a relatively organized and continuous collective action involving violence or the threat of violence, for securing more share in the control or ownership of land and its produce and to abolish injustices which have arisen thereof and which involves *kisans* and *khetihar mazdoors.* (Singh, 1984:96). The term 'peasant' in the above definition has been avoided. The conceptual uneasiness in the use of the term 'peasant movement' on various counts is reflected in the writings of a number of scholars. A.R. Desai categorically states "the term 'agrarian' represents a larger category of humanity than the term 'peasant'...". A similar echo is sounded by Ghanshyam Shah who states, "We use the term peasantry in a broad sense, for convenience rather that out of conviction to cover a large number of studies. In fact, our preference is to avoid the term 'peasant' which is not very useful in the analysis of agrarian relationship in the subcontinent".

The theoretic tensions and ambivalence in the usages of conceptual terms, such as 'peasant movement' and 'agrarian movement' or 'struggle' suggest of the rapid social structural dynamics in the Indian countryside. Before the abolition of the class of the intermediaries, the systems of *zamindari, talukdari, jagirdari* types of superior proprietary tenures in land, the division of rural population in the unmistakably neat categories of landlord, on the one hand, and the underdog tenants, the exploited rural poor, on the other, was clear and vivid. The decline of the ex-landlords, the rise of middle class/caste cultivating ex-tenant and, further, the penetration of modern agricultural technology, market system and the emphasis on capital formation, and its further investment in agricultural and various other developmental factors operating in countryside, including the rise of territorial cultivating caste, groupings, such as those of the Jats in western Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana, and the Ahirs (Yadavas) and Kurmis cultivating castes of Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have introduced hierarchies and heterogeneities in the rural society.

Let us elucidate some of the relevant aspects of peasant movements with an illustrative case of my own field study of land-grab movement that took place in Basti district of East Uttar Pradesh in 1970. This study was based on the recording of data during the course of the operation of the movement in Basti district. Structure of this movement is presented in its natural components.

# ❑❑ **The Case of Land-Grab Movement**

#### **Agrarian Structure and the Genesis of the Movement**

Like any social movement, peasant movements, generally begins from the contradictions inherent in the structure of land relationship in the countryside. Basti district has a total area of 2821 sq miles and its 95.5 per cent of population living in 7653 villages. About 91 per cent of its population is engaged in agriculture. During the colonial phase, 14.4 per cent of population of the two upper castes, that is, the Rajputs and Brahmans, owned and controlled as much as 64 per cent of the land of the district as opposed to 63 middle and lower castes with as much as 86.6 per cent of population owing only 36 per cent of the land.

The Ahirs and the Kurmis with 11.83 per cent and 8.71 per cent of the total district population, on account of the Land Settlement Acts of 1883 and 1889, had become *pukhetadars* and *dakhilkars* (*i.e.,* occupancy tenants) or received permanent under-proprietary right on land. These two castes, together, possessed four per cent of the agricultural land. In addition, they also cultivated land under temporary ownership granted by the *zamindars.* With large family size, absence of taboo on manual labour, lower economic consumption, and high agricultural production, these two castes could save more economic surplus and, at the time of the abolition of the *zamindari system* in 1954. They had attained sufficient economic strength to purchase more land from the upper castes.

The lower and exterior castes, especially the Harijans with 21.6 per cent of the total Hindu population of the district had just 29 acres of land under their possession.

The laudable aim behind the *zamindari* abolition policy of the state of Uttar Pradesh was that its implementation on the *zamindars* held land holdings beyond the stipulated ceiling of the *zamindari* Abolition Act would release the surplus to be distributed among the landless and those who had grossly uneconomic small land-holdings. This aim could not be realized. The *zamindar's* defensive response was more effective in defeating the very purpose of the *Zamindari* Abolition Act than the efficiency of the state to implement it. The *zamindars* resorted to the use of following methods to defeat the objectives of *Zamindari* Abolition Act:

- 1. Fictitious land transfer in the name of distant relatives and loyal ex-tenants;
- 2. Transfer of land in the name of trusts, like schools, temples, and *pathshalas* (esoteric educational institutions) of which the landlord himself became the controller of the property;
- 3. Conversion of agricultural land in orchard and grooves, dairy, and cooperative farms on which ceiling limits were not applied initially;
- 4. Transfer of land in the name of any tenant and taking loan from government or bank by mortgaging the land on behalf of such a tenant; and
- 5. Fictitious partition and divorce in the family.

The land retained under (a), (b), (c), and (e) were of the temporary nature. Subsequently, a large-scale legal sale of land took place in Basti district. The main purchasers were, generally, the ascendant castes of Kurmis and Ahirs who, on account of: (1) large family size, absence of taboo on manual labour, abundance of domestic labour-power, with low rate of economic investment on agriculture, reaping richer harvest, less costly life-style, etc., and (2) their opportunity, which again, on account of their large family size, allow some members of the family to migrate to cities, like Bombay, Calcutta, and Kanpur to earn money and send that back to the village home, had helped these two castes in accumulating and furthering their economic power by purchasing more land from the declining *zamindars.* In this process, other factors, in addition to these pointed above, such as the cultural notions of the upper-castes about land also helped the Kurmis and Ahirs to increase the size of their land-holdings.

The shape of the emerging agrarian scene during the late sixties of this century was characterized by the emergence of a conservative caste peasantry as a force in the countryside who reaped the harvest of the land reform policies of the state. This ascending class of the middle-class caste population after becoming richer and secure began to socially mingle with their ex-masters, the Rajputs and Brahmans than with lower and exterior castes and classes in the society. Consequently, they also began distancing themselves from the lower and exterior castes. The lower and exterior castes, especially the Harijans were left behind and they could not improve their life situation of poverty, deprivation, and neglect. It was these people, who were psychologically ready to put a struggle for securing social justice in the countryside.

The left-oriented political parties, like CPI, CPI (M), and SSP, not only provided ideological backing to the uprising, they, in fact, also began educating the small cultivators in the art and value of agitation and revolt. The cultivators were introduced with notions of 'party', organization', membership', 'rights', and 'demands'. The political socialization of the peasant, generally, becomes effective if the injustice exists and is allowed to persist in the system of land-relationship. This is exactly what happened.

The lower exterior castes who had failed to get benefits from the land policies of the state, under the leadership of the left, started occupying land not only of the upper-caste landlords, but also of the middle caste cultivators. Under the leadership of the left political parties, many attempts, in some cases, involving violence, were made by an ideologically active lower and exterior caste members, forcefully occupying the land of the bigger landholders. Their mobilization, communication, and strategy of the revolt were defined by the left leadership.

Land-grab movement suffered a failure on account of the absence of local leadership, lesser numbers of the fighting collectivity, and the introduction of sectarian factor in the movement. Even though, this movement did not immediately bring about any changes in the agrarian system of Basti district, it introduced a "consciousness" about the political value of protest and revolt as a weapon for seeking social justice in society.

The rather over-simplified summary of the relevant aspects of land-grab movement presented above, could be, with some variations, the biography of many peasant movement in India. Some movements, such as those of Telengana, Tebhaga, and the Naxalbari had have greater and far wide impact on the state and society than the other, such as the one depicted above, which had died with lesser impact on social structure.

After having presented an illustrative case of a peasant movement, let us now do some exercise in the problems of the classification of social movement and present an introduction to the notion of "new movements".

# ❑❑ **Classification of Movement and The "New Movements"**

#### **Problem of Classification**

Scientific inquiry is characterized by its emphasis on empirical rationality and causal explanation of phenomenon. Codification and classification are attempts at systematizing phenomenon and make them amenable for the scientific inquiry. In fact, all definitions of phenomenon imply and contain within them some principles of classification. The basic principles used in developing a system of classification are: (1) the principle of resemblance, and (2) the principle of difference. In what ways concept of social change differs from the concept of social movement? In the earlier section of this article, we have attempted for separating the concept of social change from that of the movement. And, if one follows the way, they have been separated, one would note the way these two principles, *i.e.,* the resemblances and differences principles have been used as tools for classification.

In the study of social movement, the problem of classification is more acute. Suiting the theoretic or ideological preferences of the scholar, the same movement has, in the writing of one scholar, been characterized as peasant movement and in the other as a sectarian one.

While it is simple to refer tribal uprisings as 'tribal movement' or women's protest against gender discrimination as "women's movement", it is far more difficult to separate reformative, restorative or revivalist movements from the other types of social movements, including the tribal and women's movements. This problem can be made more vivid and explicit with an illustration taken from Kathleen Gough's system of classification of peasant uprisings. Taking goal, ideology, and method of organization, Gough develops a five-fold type of peasant movements in India during the colonial period. These five types of peasant movements are: (1) restorative rebellion, (2) religious movements, (3) social banditry, (4) terrorist vengeance, and (5) mass insurrection.

How could *raja* Chait Singh's revolt (1778-81) against the British be referred to as peasant uprising? And, if the subject population of the *raja*  rallied behind their master in the present context, *raja* Chait Singh, the peasantry was not fighting for its own interest but for the interest of the master. *Raja's* and *zamindar's* struggles can hardly be referred to as peasant movements. Similar classificatory distortions can be identified in other types of Gough's classification of peasant uprising. In order to avoid such pitfalls, we developed a set of three different indicators to help classifying different types of social movements. These indicators are:

- 1. Identifying the foci of protest and conflict. This indicator relates to the issue of locating the axial factors, such as land and its produce, communal, religious, cultural, gender, ethnic, ecological around which a collectivity of protesting group comes into being.
- 2. Identifying the membership and participation of different sections of community, including gender groups. This indicator helps us in narrowing down to the specific sections of population who share the foci of the mobilizing collectivity.
- 3. Identifying the target group or institution, caste, class against which or whom a movement is launched. Aided with the guiding principles of resemblance and difference, the above three indices provide a dependable classificatory scheme for the classification of different types of social movements. Further, each type, with the application of the same scheme, can render simple, concrete, and specific sub-types of the movements. Our concern on the question of the classification of social reality, especially social movements, has been on account of the fact, that classification of phenomenon, in many instances, amount to the near comprehension of the same and is a front door that leads to the proper scientific understanding of the reality.

After having discussion on the various aspects of social and peasant movements and having done some elementary exercises on the problem of classification of social movements, it is worthwhile to present the essential details about those social movements which are being referred to as 'new movements' at the end of this article. On account of constraint, we shall only present the theoretic context and expression of these movements.

## **The New Movements: Many expressions of the new social movements are not new (Frank and Fuentes, 1987-1503)**

The dominant theoretic articulation expressed in the new movements, is that they are, generally, non-class movements. New movements do not have a class core. The new movements symbolize the post-modernist intellectual and emotive outburst of an age which has come to discover that pinning an unbounded faith and optimism on the hitherto-force man redeeming magical potency of science and rationality, modernism and industrialism, bureaucracy and other apparatuses of modern society are hopeless and misleading. Scholars (Touraine, 1987a, 1987b; Touraine, Wieviorka, and Dubet, 1992; Cohen, 1985:663-716; Melucci, 1985:789-816; and Eder, 1985:869-89) lay emphasis on non-class movements which are, generally, social mobilization in search of identity, social and cultural roots; to fight alienation and sickness which are the product of modernism and industrialism, to resist ecological destruction and pollution produced by economic enterprises. The feminism, anti-racism, and struggles for the safeguard of human rights and civic liberty are the best examples of the new movements.

The new movements are the product of a shift in the modern thinking from the model of functionalism and the materialistic paradigm of Marxism, industrialism, economic imperialism, etc., to a new paradigm of human and individual dignity. In India, new movements signify movements of the farmers for a bargain with the state; Chipko movement of Himalaya for the restoration and safeguard of ecological balance and many more movements around gender discrimination, civil rights, ethnic issues, and also on the questions of forests and dams.

In the emerging system of contemporary communicative global social order, many aspects of the new movements, such as "saving the planet", ecology, pollution, civic rights, universalize the human concerns and have a tendency to transform the native man into an universal man. And it is in this direction that the future role of the new movement lies.

# ❑❑ **Conclusion**

This article has attempted to present an outline of peasant and peasant movements in India. It aimed at situating the conception of peasant movements in the centre of the emerging tensions between the theoretical constructions and their empirical roots and meanings in society. It made effort to demonstrate how conceptions, like 'peasantry', 'change', 'movements', in the social science texts, swing between the poles of an utter empirical vacuity and empty theoretical resonances. Like the historicity of feudalism, peasantry was the expression of a specific phase of history. It did exist as a 'social type'. The uncritical acceptance of its continued presence in the contemporary phase of the Indian countryside which is the scene of dramatic social transformations, this article suggests, is an exercise in academic ritualism.

The concept of social movement is linked with the concept of society. If society is seen as a process, it emerges as an entity defined by change. This article attempted at separating the foci of social change from the foci of social movements. The peasant movements are presented as a specific form of social movements. These make an effort to examine Marxist paradigm of collective mobilization and social movements. In order to present a holistic account of the contemporary discussion on social movements, the present article includes a brief discussion onthe theoretic background of the conception of the new social movements. Our overall aim has been to present a bird's-eye-view of peasant and peasant movements. It aims to sensitize the scholar to the issues relating to the need of critically re-examining some of the conceptions and meanings of peasant and peasant mobilizations in India. We believe that the empirical rationality, coupled with sensitivity to social data, alone can add further progress in this field of social science inquiry in the domain of movement studies in India.
