# More Predictive Modeling Projects

You can now work through predictive modeling machine learning projects using R. Now what? In this chapter, we look at ways that you can practice and refine your new found skills.

## 21.1 Build And Maintain Recipes

Throughout this book you have worked through many machine learning lessons using R. Taken together, this is the start of your own private code base that you can use to jump-start your current or next machine learning project. These recipes are a beginning, not an end. The larger and more sophisticated that your catalog of machine learning recipes is, the faster you can get started on new projects and the more accurate models that you can develop.

As you apply your machine learning skills using the R platform, you will develop experience and skills with new and different techniques using the R platform. You can pull-out or abstract snippets and recipes as you go along and add them to your own collection of recipes, building upon the code that you can use on future machine learning projects. With time, you will amass your own mature and highly-tailored catalog of machine learning code for R.

#### 21.2 Small Projects on Small Datasets

Keep practicing your skills using R. Datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository were used throughout this book to demonstrate how to achieve specific tasks in a machine learning project. They were also used in the longer case study projects. They are standardized, relatively clean, well understood and excellent for you to use as practice datasets.

You can use the datasets on the UCI Machine Learning repository as the focus of small (5-to-10 hours of effort) focused machine learning projects using the R platform. Once completed, you can write-up your findings and share them online as part of your expanding portfolio of machine learning projects.

These can be used by you later as a repository of knowledge on which you can build and further develop your skills. They can also be used to demonstrate to bosses or future employers that you are capable of delivering results no predictive modeling machine learning projects using the R platform. Here is a process that you can use to practice machine learning on R:

1. Browse the list of free datasets on the repository and download some that look interesting to you.

- 2. Use the project template and recipes in this book to work through the dataset and develop an accurate model.
- 3. Write up your work-flow and findings in a way that you can refer to it later or perhaps share it publicly on a website.

Keep the project short, limit your projects to 5-to-10 hours, say a week worth of nights and spare time.

### 21.3 Competitive Machine Learning

Use competitive machine learning to push your skills. Working on small projects in the previous section is a good way to practice the fundamentals. At some point the problems will become easy for you. You also need to be pushed out of your comfort zone to help you grow your skills further.

An excellent way to develop your machine learning skills with R further is to start participating in competitions. In a competition, the organizer provides you with a training dataset dataset, a test dataset on which you are to make predictions, a performance measure and a time limit. You and your competitors then work to create the most accurate mode possible. Winners often get prize money.

These competitions often last weeks to months can be a lot of fun. They also offer a great opportunity to test your skills with machine learning tools on datasets that often require a lot of cleaning and preparation. The premier platform for machine learning competitions is Kaggle: <http://www.kaggle.com>.

Competitions are stratified into different classes such as research, recruitment and 101 for beginners. A good place to start would be the beginner competitions as they are often less challenging and have a lot of help in the form of tutorials to get you started.

## 21.4 Summary

In this chapter you have discovered 3 areas where you could practice your new found machine learning skills with R. They were:

- 1. To continue to build up and maintain your catalog of machine learning recipes starting with the catalog of recipes provided as a bonus with this book.
- 2. To continue to work on the standard machine learning datasets described in Chapter 5 as well as the broader set of datasets on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- 3. To start work through the larger datasets from competitive machine learning and even start participating in machine learning competitions.

#### 21.4.1 Next Step

This concludes Part III of this book on machine learning projects. Up next we finish off the book with a summary of how far you have come and where you can look if you need additional help with R.
