#### INTRODUCTION

Pressure groups can be considered as both 'influence groups' and particular 'interest groups'. Unlike the political parties they do not put up the candidates for the election and therefore, are not completely a political organization. These groups can also be termed as 'private institutions formed to influence the policies of the government'. There is the platform from which the people with particular interest can come together to influence the public policy. Therefore, pressure groups are those social groups which strive to influence the functioning of the parliamentarians and the bureaucrats but without making any effort to gain control over the government itself.

#### PRESSURE GROUPS: MEANING AND DEFINITIONS

Phrase such as 'interest groups', 'private organization', 'lobbying' and 'interest articulators' are interchangeably

used most of the times for terming the 'pressure groups'. These pressure groups are free and independent institutions and they serve important political ends. Such interest groups which are organized for political action are also considered as pressure groups and such groups have direct political significance.

These pressure groups are non-political and the politics in which they are engaged are that of policy-making.

They are the organized groups which seek to influence the decisions of the government without themselves taking part in the actual functioning of the government. They attempt to exert influence over the government or parliament or local authorities, but they do not themselves seek to act as the government. They are, in short, auxiliary drains of representation.

Such groups are a far more important channel of communication than parties for the transmission of political ideas from the mass of the citizenry to their rulers.

Pressure groups are concerned with specific issues. They use their means and persuasive powers to obtain certain political decisions without having or seeking the power to make them. Glyn Parry has very rightly observed that *when a group is concerned either wholly or partly with such pressure in order to influence those who determine public policy, such a group can be referred to interest pressure groups*.

Thus, the prime function of a pressure group is to promote the interests of its members and pressurize the government. They are concerned with specific issues and selfinterest to promote their own cause is the basic reason of their formation and existence. They are non-political entities. They are involved in the political process but are not willing to assist in forming a government if called upon to do so. They have no political programme or scheme as such. They are the medium through which the function of articulation of interests is performed in a political system.

Therefore, the pressure groups are the interest groups which function to secure particular interest by influencing the policies of the government. They are also notaligned to any political parties and work as an indirect and dominant entity to influence the policy decisions of the government.

These pressure groups try to secure their own particular interests by inducing the policy to align with their interests. These institutions tend to be non-partisan which attempt to change some of the phases of public life. The role played by these pressure groups, though indirect, invisible and intermittent but are very important part of the governance system. The raise of trusts and monopolies and the tussle over the tariffs led to the formulation of such pressure groups. These groups are the voice of the public directing the functioning of the parties. And thus, the pressure groups are as important and vital as that of any political party functioning in a country. Some scholars consider the pressure groups to be anonymous empire, unofficial government and as private institutions formed to influence the policies of the government. These pressure groups act outside the sphere of the political parties and there exists vast difference between the two.

#### **PRESSURE GROUPS AND INTEREST GROUPS**

'Pressure groups' and 'interest groups' are terms, which are used interchangeably. There is no significant difference between the two. They are different without being distinguished. But strictly from a theoretical point of view, pressure groups can be distinguished from interest groups. Commenting on this, Earl Latham has remarked: '*Not all interest groups are pressure groups, then, although all interest groups may become pressure groups when the occasion arises*'. It is true that all groups do not have a direct political significance. For example, all educated housewives in a locality constitute a 'group' in a statistical sense. To economists, investors and consumers are a group; to sociologists, the family is a primary group. Today, students, teachers, businessmen—all have something in common within their respective categories, a something that can be called as an 'interest'. Thus, they may be regarded as 'interest groups'. They may have some indirect political significance when parties and bureaucracy voluntarily take their interests into account. But interest groups can acquire direct political significance when they become political actors, when they actively try to influence the course of public policy and decision-making processes, when they work to put desired statutes into law or attempt to pursue the administrators or the officials to exercise their authorities for the benefit of their groups. Thus, 'interest groups that are organized for action of this type are thought of as pressure groups, and it is these that have direct political significance'.

Therefore, similarities between pressure groups and interest groups are, that they are voluntary organizations andare conscious towards their common interests and try to protect their common ends. They are 'face-to-face groups'.

Pressure groups are, at the same time, influence groups, too. Verney observes that '*the first criterion of a political interest group for our purpose is that it shall possess this influence*'. While interest groups, on the other side, are organized to protect shared sectional interests.

Thus, it may be said that these groups in practice overlap considerably. Specifically, in India it is rather difficult to draw a line of demarcation between pressure groups and interest groups. Both of them are playing the role of interest articulators of a high order at the varied levels of the Indian political system.

#### **DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POLITICAL PARTY AND PRESSURE GROUPS**

Both the political parties and the pressure groups play an important role in determining the public policies of the country, though this function may seem similar there exists vast difference between the two. The major difference between the political parties and the pressure groups are as follows:

| Political Party                                                                                                                                                  | Pressure Group                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Political parties act directly<br>and intervene in the policy<br>matters, they are also legal<br>ly entitled to frame policies<br>concerning the govern<br>ment. | The action of the pressure<br>group is both indirect as<br>well as intermittent. They in<br>directly influence and pres<br>surize the government in or<br>der to get their interest and<br>demand fulfilled. |
| Political parties work for<br>national interest and they<br>have permanent existence<br>and works continuously<br>for the larger needs of the<br>public.         | Pressure groups generally<br>work for self-interest, and<br>they emerge and dissolve<br>as per the need.                                                                                                     |
| Political parties try to bring<br>coordination in the working<br>between the executive and<br>the legislature.                                                   | The pressure groups gener<br>ally pressurize the execu<br>tive and the legislature to<br>fulfil the demand.                                                                                                  |
| Political parties form and<br>constitute the government.                                                                                                         | Pressure groups is a public<br>body that acts behind the<br>government (outside the po<br>litical party).                                                                                                    |
| Political parties generally<br>use the constitutional means<br>to execute its duties and<br>functions.                                                           | Pressure group uses both<br>conventional and non-con<br>ventional means to put forth<br>their demands.                                                                                                       |
| Political parties are recog<br>nized by the Election Com<br>mission.                                                                                             | Pressure groups are tempo<br>rary as they emerge and<br>dissolve.                                                                                                                                            |

#### **MEDIA AS PRESSURE GROUP**

The media plays an important role in displaying various happenings of the politics and life of common people. In countries such as in India the mass media such as the radio, TV, cinema and the press are very powerful mediums of social change and also act as pressure groups for representing the interests of the common man and exposes all the deeds of the government. Media can work without restriction and expose the functioning of the government and have no such restriction. Moreover, the mass media help to set-up a common platform which try to focus on the core issues of the society. Hence, role of the media is much more important in influencing the functioning of the political parties than that of other such pressure groups. Therefore, in the contemporary world, the media acts as an agent of social change, focusing on the social development of the society. Media also pressurizes the government which is also of significant importance.

#### **SIGNIFICANCE AND ROLE OF PRESSURE (INTEREST) GROUPS**

Whether western or non-western, the study of the pressure groups finds an important place in both. These pressure groups were once considered and viewed with alarm and moral indignation. It was viewed that these pressure groups lead to alteration of the democratic process. But gradually these pressure groups were coming to be recognized as indispensable and today they are not seen as evil, but rather seen as healthy development in the political set-up. Its role was so important that H. R. Mahood had remarked, '*Organized groups may be regarded as systems of private government while the organs of state represent a system of public government*'. The following are the factors that determine the importance of pressure groups:

- **a. Keeps democracy alive**: The pressure groups help to keep the democracy alive. They play important role between the election period and establish a barrier against the interregnum. They supplement government and the political parties by serving as voice of the interests of the people in the society.
- **b. Make valuable data available**: The pressure groups help to generate valuable data which are made available to the governmental agencies and to the public in general. They also provide necessary information and statistics to the policy-makers. With help of such data, the policy-makers can support and formulate necessary legislations.
- **c. Balance the national and particular interest**: Pressure groups are considered to be inevitable in a democratic set-up, and they help to balance the national and particular interests. They function as a link between the citizen and the government. Rodee observes, '*The elected official in turn can evaluate the desires of his constituents more effectively through the unofficial channel of interest groups activity*'.
- **d. Acts against the emergence of a single, dominant social force**: Those who support the interest groups also point out the fact that a democracy permits its citizens to freely express their different interest and desires, and such interest groups help to protect against the emergence of single, dominant social force. All groups such as businessmen, farmers, workers, social groups, religious groups, women, etc., all seek to advance their own interest and thereby, compete with each other. This therefore, results in balancing of demands and this countervailing tendency protects the society against the threat that any one individual group may dominate over the others.

- **e. Shield against the sword wielded by the government**: Day by day the powers and the functions of the government are increasing. The increased growth of the government is due because of the growth of theory of welfare state and development of method of planned development. Prevalence of socialism and positivism as also aided its growth; therefore, the interest groups have to act against the power wielded by the government.
- **f. Legislature behind a legislature**: The pressure groups are acting as legislature behind a legislature. Because of their specialized expertise knowledge and skill, they influence law-making on the floor of the legislatures. And these pressure groups attempt to elect individuals who represent their interests. They tend to help the parties by contributing for its electoral funds and win tickets for their favourite parliamentary nominees.

In short, we can consider the pressure groups to be representative of the democracy itself. In various countries, different factors are responsible for their increasing importance. In India, the growth of the functions of the government has resulted in the creation and consolidation of the interest groups. The doctrines such as the welfare state, globalization of the economy, statism and growth of governmental interference in the everyday life of the people has accelerated the functions of the pressure groups.

#### **PRESSURE GROUPS TECHNIQUES**

The pressure groups use various techniques and methods to achieve their results. Some of the most commonly used techniques are as follows:

**Firstly**, pressure groups strive to elect and secure nomination of sympathetic legislators, who can be later approached to enact favourable laws. In the modern era, the legislators often find themselves at the mercy of these pressure groups. How this happens is very simple, the legislators above all want to maximize their possibilities for getting re-elected, and in return they have to submit to the demands made by these pressure groups.

**Secondly**, lobbying is one of the frequent techniques used by the pressure groups. This is a political technique whereby the government and its policies are influenced. Thus, interest groups representing their interests to the government and the legislature, in order, to modify the public policy to their benefits may be termed as lobbying. In fact, lobbying act as intermediary between the pressure groups and the government.

The following are the three important functions performed by the lobbyist to the legislators and the executives. They are:

- Defending the interest of the employer.
- Define the political implications of some important issues.
- Communication of vital information.

**Thirdly**, the pressure groups create climate favourable for their particular interest by appealing to the public opinion through use of various mediums like, speech, pamphlets, new articles, videos, radios and even motion pictures.

**Fourthly**, these pressure groups associate themselves with one or the other political party and therefore, act as a powerful faction within the political party. And when the political party forms the government, the objective of the pressure groups are easily attained.

**Fifthly**, sometimes, elite representation on behalf of the interest groups constitutes a channel of access which are utilized by the interest groups to promote their own interest. It may be carried out by placing a member of the pressure groups in the rule-making structure. The members of these pressure groups are given representation in the legislative committees in order to submit their views.

**Sixthly**, the mass media is considered to be one of the effective channels of medium used by the pressure groups. In a democratic society the utilization of mass media to submit the political demands is an important medium of communicating to the decision-makers.

**Seventhly**, one the other means of communicating the demands is through physical demonstrations and vigour. Such methods are generally employed by the anomic pressure groups. Using of riots, assassination and demonstrations by some groups are also not uncommon.

**Eighthly**, sometimes these pressure groups survive by using bribery and corruption. There is allegation that these pressure groups employ any method possible to be able to fulfil their demands and interests. There is considerable degree of outright corruption or backstage intrigue.

**Ninthly**, the pressure groups disseminate their views through the use of press. They generally get the support of the news agencies and the general public. Their views are given wide publicity and contrary views are not generally stated.

**Tenthly**, the pressure groups influence the policies and the decisions of the government by supplying them with essential data and information. Most of the present pressure groups maintain a separate research centre to come out with reliable data and information. Thus, important policies are formulated based on the information supplied by these pressure groups.

**And finally**, occasionally drafts of the bills of the legislatures are framed by these pressure groups. They possess the necessary skill and expert knowledge in their own particular area. They are also well versed with the administrative process and know how to get things done by overcoming the bureaucratic red-tapism.

Odegard has made the following comments on the techniques adopted by the pressure groups:

An interest group resorts to three different techniques to achieve its purpose:

**First**, the pressure groups can try to influence the public opinion and thereby, gaining an indirect influence over the decision-makers. Since the government is democratic, it tends to get influenced by the public opinion. Such technique is termed as propagandizing.

**Second**, these groups can also try to place persons who are disposed towards their interest in the government or pubic offices, so that they decide favourably in their favour. This technique is called as electioneering.

**Third**, these groups tend to influence the government officials and administrators even if they are not favourable towards them, to adopt and enforce policies which benefit the cause of the pressure groups. This technique is termed as lobbying.

Such methods and techniques vary from country to country and government to government. The actual influence of these groups depends on the functioning of the government.

#### **CLASSIFICATION OF INTEREST GROUPS**

The interest groups can be classified into three types:

- Communal pressure groups
- Institutional pressure groups
- Associational pressure groups

#### **Communal Pressure Groups**

The chief characteristic of communal groups is that they are embedded within the social fabric, in the sense that membership is based on birth, rather than through recruitment. Examples of such groups are families, tribes, castes and ethnic groups. Unlike conventional interest groups, to which members choose to belong, and which possess a formal structure and organization, communal groups are founded on the basis of a shared heritage and traditional bonds and loyalties. Such groups still play a major role in the politics of developing countries. In Africa, for instance, ethnic, tribal and kinship ties are often the most important basis of interest articulation. Communal groups also continue to survive and exert influence in advanced industrial states, as the resurgence of ethnic nationalism and the significance of Catholic groups in countries like Italy and Ireland demonstrate.

#### **Institutional Groups**

Institutional groups are groups that are part of the machinery of government and attempt to exert influence in and through that machinery. They differ from interest groups in that they enjoy no measure of autonomy or independence. Bureaucracies and the military are the clearest examples of institutional groups, and, not uncommonly, each of these contains a number of competing interests. In the case of authoritarian or totalitarian states, which typically suppress autonomous groups and movements, rivalry amongst institutional groups may become the principal form of interest articulation. The highly centralized Stalinist system in the USSR, for instance, was driven largely by entrenched bureaucratic and economic interests, in particular those centred around heavy industry. Similarly, the apparently monolithic character of the Hitler state in Germany, 1933–45, concealed a reality of bureaucratic infighting as Nazi leaders built-up sprawling empires in an endless struggle for power.

Institutional groups are not only of significance in nondemocratic regimes. Some go so far as to argue that the bureaucratic elites and vested interests that develop in the ministries, departments and agencies of democratic systems in effect shape the policy process; they serve to constrain, some would say dictate to, elected politicians and elected governments. Such groups certainly also form alliances with conventional interest groups.

#### **Associational Pressure Groups**

Associational groups are ones that are formed by people who come together to pursue shared, but limited, goals. Groups as associations are characterized by voluntary action and the existence of common interests, aspirations or attitudes. The most obvious examples of associational groups are thus, what are usually thought of as interest groups or pressure groups. However, the distinction between these and communal groups may sometimes be blurred. For example, when class loyalties are strong and solidaristic, membership of an associational group such as a trade union may be more an expression of social identity than an instrumental act aimed at furthering a particular goal. Although associational groups are becoming increasingly important in developing states, they are usually seen as a feature of industrial societies.

#### **MAJOR PRESSURE GROUPS IN INDIA**

Some of the major pressure groups in India are as follows:

- **a. Peasant Organizations**: These organizations gained power during the 1960s, at the national level All India Kisan Congress plays a dominant role, whereas in state level number of organizations exists namely *Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sangh*, Farmers Collective, *Bhartiya Kisan* Party, etc.
- **b. Linguistic Groups**: These are pressure groups formed to promote and endorse certain languages. Some of the organizations are, Hindi *Parishad*, Tamil *Sangh*, *Telugu Sangh*, *Punjabi Sahit Sabhas*, etc.
- **c. Community Associations**: These are formed to protect and safeguard interests of certain communities. For example, *Kongunadu Munnetra Kazhagam*, *Vishwa Hindu Parishad*, Schedule Caste Federation, etc.
- **d. Professional Groups**: These represent the interests of members of particular profession. For example, *All India Bar Association, Engineers Association, Medical Council*, etc.
- **e. Tribal Groups**: These articulate the interests of the tribal population. Some of the active groups are, Tribal Sang of Assam, Bodos Development Federation, *United Mizo Federal Organization*, etc.
- **f. Student's Organization**: These groups pressurize the government on various issues faced by the students such as education, fee structure, etc. some of the organizations that represent the interest of the students are, *Democratic Youth Federation of India, All India Student Federation, National Students' Union of India, Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad*, etc.
- **g. Business Groups**: They are independent of the political groups and parties, but influence them in making policies and decisions, especially they play a significant role in budget formulation. Some of the organizations are, *Association Chamber of Commerce, Conference of Indian Industries, and Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce, etc*.

#### **INTEREST GROUPS: FOR AND AGAINST**

The following are the arguments made in favour of the interest groups:

- They help to widen the scope of political participation, by providing an alternative path to participate in the politics without involving with any political party. They also help in nurturing of grass roots activism.
- They also help to maintain the political stability by creating a channel of communication between the people and the administrators, whereby aligning the outputs with that of the inputs required.
- They help in promoting, propagating debate and discussion, thus creating an informed and educated electorate. This helps in improving the quality of the public policy.
- They help to keep check on the governmental power, and thus defend the ideals of liberty ensuring that interests of members of the society are protected against the visions of rulers.
- They help in strengthening of the alternate representation whose voice are generally unheard and ignored by the political parties and the government. They also provide means of influencing the policies of the government between the elections.

#### **The following are the arguments made against the interest groups:**

- These groups tend to make the policy process much more secretive and closed by influencing the decisions which are in no way subject to scrutiny by the public.
- They are considered to be socially and politically divisive as they represent only particular interest and not general interest of the society. They advance only minority interests against that of the entire society.
- They also tend to make the societies ungovernable as they create an array of vested interest which block the legitimate functioning and decision-making of the government. They make the policies unworkable if it not aligned to their interests.
- They create political inequality by voicing only the concerns of the wealthy and the privileged, those who do not have financial means, or education or other resources go unrepresented.
- They are a centre of non-legitimate power, wherein such leaders are not publicly accountable to the people and their influence bypass the legitimate representative process.

#### **FEATURES OF INDIAN PRESSURE GROUPS**

Politics in India is at present pre-eminently the politics of pressure groups rather than that of the political parties. A new type of pressure groups model with its own distinctive features is in the process of making and that, too, is unique and different from the Western model of pressure groups. The specific features of the Indian model of pressure groups can be summed up as follows:

- **a. Presence of pressure groups sponsored by political parties:** As far as India is concerned, the political parties tend to organize their own interest groups in various spheres such as trade, education, profession, etc. For example, the Communist Party sponsors *Student's Federation of India,* the Congress supports *Youth Congress* and the *Bhartiya Janata Party* is represented by the *Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad, etc*.
- **b. Depending on direction actions:** Indian pressure groups generally take up measures which are direct actions and have immediate consequences. Hence, measures such as, *bandh*, *gheraos*, strikes, etc., are frequently adopted.
- **c. States themselves acting as a pressure group**: Articles 262 and 263 of the constitution provides for the Central government to settle the border disputes and interstate river water disputes, therefore, every state maintains a Liaison Officer at the centre to represent its interests in matter of such disputes. Thus, states act as pressure groups in matters concerning them.
- **d. Sudden emergence and dissolution:** These interest groups are formed to put forth some particular interest, and once such interest is represented or attained, they tend to dissolve as their further existence is not required. Thus, these pressure groups are temporary in nature, examples of such groups are anti-dowry groups, anti-*sati* groups, etc.
- **e. Non-alignment with any political party:** The pressures groups in India exist and function in a multiparty environment, therefore, these groups try to maintain positive relationship with all the parties. Generally, the pressure groups try to influence the ruling political party to get their demands fulfilled and because of coalition governments, these groups tend not to align with any particular party.
- **f. Formed because of increased demand of resources and pressure:** Because of scarcity of resources, there are various claims and counterclaims on them, because of the competing nature, each group has to represent their own interest in order to benefit. This, therefore, gives rise to formation of pressure groups to represent competing interests.
- **g. Presence of caste-based and religion-based groups:**  The traditional pressure groups such as caste, community, religion, and regional are the determinants

of politics in India, thus the unique scenario in India is that, there are several groups which are formed to represent sectional caste and religious interests. They tend to promote their own ideology and interests. Some of these are, *All India Rajput Sabha*, *Khap Panchayats*, *Jat* Organizations, *Shiv Sena*, *Hindu Sabha*, Christian Federations, Muslim groups, etc. Hence, the caste groups in India may still be called as 'Sovereigns without crowns'.

- **h. Influence shifting from being negative to positive:**  During the initial days the actions of the pressure groups had negative connotations, as they protested against nationalization of rice trade, increase of land tax, etc., but at present their actions have shifted. Now these groups play assisting role by providing support to tommunist he government for framing rules and legislations. For example, the recent *Lokpal* and *Lokayukta* legislation was formulated after the consultation with all the interest group concerned.
- **i. Acting as countercheck against the political parties:** These groups tend to act against the monopoly and domination by the government and political parties. Any policy of the government cannot be taken unilaterally as it would have impact on interest of various sections of the society. Therefore, such interest has to be taken on-board by the decision-makers.
- **j. Use of both modern and traditional means:** The pressure groups use both modern and traditional means. Traditional loyalties to caste group, religion, etc. overlap with the modern methods such as lobbying, funding of political parties, electing favourable candidates, cultivating connections with the decisionmakers and the administrators, etc.
- **k. Pressure groups use the party as platform:** The pressure groups uses the party as platform to fulfil their demands and interest. They try to maintain relation with both the ruling and the party in opposition.
- **l. Formed-based on certain interest:** Fulfilling particular interest is the basis of formation of the pressure groups. And these groups are organized keeping in mind the interest it seeks to get fulfilled.

#### **CRITICISM OF PRESSURE GROUPS WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO INDIA**

The pressure groups in India are criticized on the following grounds:

**a. Dominance by a single party**: In India, it has been observed that only a single party had dominated the political scene for a long time. And these powerful political group does not want any influence by any pressure groups.

- **b. Unstable and unsteady**: Some of the pressure groups lacks stability and commitment. These groups therefore, shift their loyalties according to the changing political scenario.
- **c. Act as threat to democratic set-up:** The tendency for the pressure groups to resort to coercion and force in order to obtain benefits/solution for the problems faced by the people on the streets could be considered as a serious threat to the democratic set-up.
- **d. Diminishing lifespan:** India has a disorganized and haphazard multiparty system. Hence, some pressure groups too have temporary existence, and such existence depends on the presence and manifestation of the particular issue and interest at hand.
- **e. Do not have effective membership:** The pressure groups are also not well-structured and organized. They also do not have necessary resources and infrastructure which would help them in securing their interest.
- **f. Lack of autonomous existence:** Most of the pressure groups are dominated by the political parties, only a few groups, such as the business groups exist autonomously without the involvement of the political parties. Hence, the political party tend to dilute the aspirations and agenda of such groups.
- **g. Using of unconstitutional methods:** The pressure groups tend to use unconstitutional means to support and accomplish their cause. Some of these measure such as demonstration, strike, lockout, *Hartal*, etc., tend to disturb public peace and tranquillity.
- **h. Focus is on parochial interest:** These pressure groups generally represent sectional or parochial interest and not the general interest of all the people in

the society. Such representation of particular interests in a society leads of division and separation.

- **i. Can lead to mass violence:** Sometimes the protest by these groups can lead to extreme violence and damage. Certain kind of radicalization, such as the Naxalite movement lead to mass violence and loss of lives.
- **j. Ineffective interest articulation:** The pressure groups lack trained and effective personnel. Their functionaries are not competent enough to deal with all issues that arise. Hence, they do not effectively articulate their position and ideas to the concerned officials which is required to fulfil their demand.

#### **CONCLUSION**

The existence of the pressure groups has become indispensable and have now become part of the democratic set-up. Pressure groups promote not only national and particular interests, they constitute a link between the citizens and the government. They also gather necessary data and information which helps in keeping the issue politically alive. Today, the politics has to be carried out through consultation, negotiation, etc., and this can be effectively done only with help of the pressure groups.
