The term of Public Administration, bureaucracy, civil service all has the common thread connecting them and in various context they reflect and have a similar meaning. The term public administration though has a wider meaning, which includes both the elected and permanent executive, while the term bureaucracy has come to denote the administration and hence the civil service and Civil Service is the body of permanent government officials who are appointed to run the country. In this Chapter we will be using terms Public Administration, Bureaucracy and Civil Service and they all refer to the same- the Public official appointed to the government with the mandate to serve the nation with public interest.

## INTRODUCTION

Civil service refers to the body of government officials who are appointed to the civil occupations that are neither political nor judicial.

The term bureaucracy has a wider meaning, it refers to the body of employees in a large-scale organisation. More specifically it is related to the body of such employees having authority relationship within the organisation. Thus, every large business has its bureaucracy. In the government there are two types, the civil and military bureaucracies.

In the literature of public administration, the term civil bureaucracy has wider meaning than that of civil service. Thus, the employees of an autonomous corporation come under the concept of bureaucracy but they are not considered to be civil servants. It should be noted that the bureaucracy do not refer to the elected politicians, they refer only to the appointed officials.

In common usage, the term bureaucracy refers to the routine and delay in authorised work, while public administration do take these into account, it generally refers bureaucracy only to the appointed officials.

Hence, civil service essentially means the appointed government official, though bureaucracy has a negative connotation to it, it has been used to refer generally to the public servants, the term public administration has a wider meaning, which brings together the civil servants, the so called bureaucracy, and also the elected representatives of the people. The subject of public administration deals with the effective management of the resourcesfinance, human, intellectual etc. to deliver services to the people. The term 'Public' is important as regards to the public administration, though civil service does not explicitly mention it. It has to adhere to the public service values as elaborated by understanding of public administration.

#### **THE NEED FOR CIVIL SERVICE**

The modern life is filled with complexity and hence the importance of public administration in such a scenario is increasing. This is because the need of the state to intervene in day-to-day activities of its citizens. There is no aspect of the life of citizen which is out of purview from the administration. The citizen comes in contact with some of the government agencies in their daily activities.

During the ancient times, the needs of the citizen were limited. They could therefore, live in a village, self-sufficiently, without any intervention by the state. But the scientific and the industrial revolution changed this scenario. The industrial products that are mass produced require specialised operation to manufacture them. Hence, the community started to live together in big cities. The means of production too has become complex and requires a much greater effort to organise them effectively.

Many a number of such activities now cannot be organised by citizens themselves privately, or as a village, or as even a community in cities. Thus the National, State and local governments have come forward to organise, and provide necessary infrastructure facilities, provide for effective production as well as facilitate the communitytype living.

For example, railways has been built for the transport of the raw materials and also to distribute the finished goods. This also apart from facilitating manufacturing, helps in movement of people over long distances, that is an important facet of modern day living.

Similarly, communication facilities like telecommunication, microwave transmissions, satellite communication etc. all have to be provided for meeting the need and requirements of the modern communities. And all these require massive men and material investment, which is impossible to be provided by a small village community.

Such huge investments are made by the National governments and is implemented and administered with help of the local governments. Financing such projects alone is not the issue here, organising such large scale projects within the specified timeline is important.

Hence the point of contact between the citizen and the government has increased tremendously. And the importance of Public Administration has been keeping pace with such developments.

In this modern era, the Public Administration is seen as the face of the government. They are the vital link connecting the people with the government. Their role has been completely transformed to suit the modern day needs. In the chapter we will be discussing about modern day impact and the importance and the role played by the Civil Service in the modern day democracy.

## **CHARACTERISTICS OF CIVIL SERVICE**

The following are the characteristics of Public Administration, they are not exclusive and exhaustive. Some of the following may be available only in the public field and others may relate to administrative efficiency.

- **1. Anonymity:** anonymity is an important characteristic of a public servant. He should maintain anonymity while carrying out the services for the public. The official acts are not carried out in their personal capacity, rather they are the agents of the government and carry out acts by virtue of the post they hold.
- **2. Consciousness of Community Service:** the Public administrator works for the 'public'. The act is carried out for the betterment of the community and not for deriving financial benefits out of them.
- **3. Public Responsibility:** the administrators have to be held publicly responsible for their acts and actions. They have to be questioned by the public regarding such aspects which will help the administration function on the right path. In India and Britain this is

achieved with the help of **Ministerial Responsibility** and other such facilities which let people, the press and the representatives of the people question the actions of the administrators.

- **4. Monopoly:** such conditions of monopoly are usual in the sphere of the government. From this characteristic raise other characteristic because of lack of competition in the administrative process.
- **5. Large-Scale Organisation:** it is the usual character of a government organisation, as it deals with numerous issues concerned with the state and its subjects. Numerous problems arise because of this characteristic of administration. And this is not an essential character of administration. Though smaller organisation exists, they exist within the larger organisation of the state.
- **6. Consistency of Rreatment:** this is an essential characteristic as the public official should not render unequal or favoured treatment to a section of people. Everyone should be treated equally and without discrimination. Unlike private service, favoured treatment cannot be accorded. The public administration should follow the law and principles laid down by the Constitution in all aspects.
- **7. Public Information:** if the character of public responsibility has to work, then the public should have access to information regarding all such acts and functions of the administrators. The secrecy is considered to be intolerable in a democratic setup, and hence the administrators have to take special steps to provide information to the public even without them demanding for such information. Public administration is held to be everybody'd business.

#### **SIGNIFICANCE OF CIVIL SERVICE**

In the contemporary age, which has witnessed the raise of 'Administrative state' has seen growth of role of the public administration. The functions it has been assigned to perform has grown in scope and function, and it is continuously increasing. Many of such functions relate to the essential requirement of human life, such as education, health, social security, sanitation etc. All these functions are over and above the basic regulatory function of the administration. The view point of eminent scholars below reflect the significance of the public administration.

**Woodrow Wilson:** "Administration is the most obvious part of the government; it is the government in action, it is the executive, the operative and the most visible side of the government."

**Brooke Adams:** "Administration is an important human faculty because its chief function is to facilitate social change and to cushion the stock of social revolution."

**Paul H. Appleby:** "Administration is the basis of government. No government can exist without administration. Without administration government would be a discussion club, if indeed, it could exist at all."

According to **Gerald Caiden** Civil Service has taken up the following crucial roles in the modern contemporary society:

- Preservation of polity;
- Maintenance of stability and order;
- Management of large scale commercial services;
- Ensuring growth and economic development;
- Institutionalisation of Socio-economic changes;
- Formation of public opinion;
- Influencing public policies; and
- Formation of public opinion.

**The significance of Civil Service can be Studied Under the Following Heads,**

#### **(i) Civil Service as an Instrument of Governance**

The most important function of the government is to govern, that is, maintain the peace, law and order, to ensure the safety and security of the people in the country. The government also has to uphold the contracts concluded between the people and settle any disputes arising between them. During the initial stages of the evolution of the government, this was probably the basic functions carried out by the administration.

As the government evolved and developed, many other important functions have been taken over by the administration, but the basic function remained the same. It is impossible to bring in development if peace is not maintained in the society. This function is highly essential and necessary, and without it civilised life is impossible.

The regulatory function of the public administration has not remained static. It has been growing in complexity as the government evolved. New methods have been developed to effectively distribute the goods for the public, new technologies have been incorporated by the administration for effective public service delivery.

 **(ii) Civil Service as an Instrument of Development and Change**

> The public administration has a very significant role to play as an instrument of change and development.

The public administration embodies within itself the desires, qualities and aspirations of the people, it also reflects the intellect of its people. The public administration is an important tool in achieving development, and without it development is not possible.

Manpower is need to run the colleges, schools and other technical institutions. Manpower is also need to build infrastructures such as roads, bridges, buildings etc. and to run the industrial machinery. Scientific manpower is needed to carry out research and development. And only a well-developed and established public administration can make all this a reality.

Though a part of the contribution is made by the private sector, it cannot complete the task in full. The private may not be willing to contribute towards establishing the basic and essential infrastructure. For example, country-wide rail connectivity, telecommunication systems, roads, basic research etc. all have to be organised by the government.

In several developmental areas the initial thrust has be given by the government, without its support development in these sectors is not possible. And this is not possible without a well-established system of public administration. This aspect was highlighted by the western governments and the aid agencies which sought to help develop the south, that is, the developing nations.

It was contended that the aid will not be of use unless an effective system of public administration is established with skilled manpower. Financial assistance cannot be transformed into productive schemes. Thus the initial task of the developing countries, is therefore, to develop adequate and necessary administrative machinery to take up diverse tasks relating to development.

The administrative support relates not only to aspects related to economic development. In the developing countries, the public administration is also an instrument of social change. A number of welfare schemes have to be taken up. New laws to bring in development have to be enacted and enforced. For examples, laws relating to dowry, untouchables, protection of SCs, STs, rights of minorities, Children, labour, women etc. Though the impetus for development comes from the political class, it is the administration that drafts and enforces them. This is the fundamental task of the public administration.

**(iii) Civil Service as an Instrument of Welfare State** In a modern democratic state, the government has to carry out several welfare functions for the people. This includes various aspects related to provision of schooling, medical facilities and other social security related issues. With the breaking down of the joint-family system, the responsibility of taking care the elderly and the infants, orphans and the widows fall upon the shoulders of the government. With the economic slowdown, the government now has to lookout for the unemployed youths also.

The development may raise up new problems such as those of creation of urban slums, pollution, juvenile delinquents etc. The state therefore has to identify all these problems and device necessary solutions addressing them. The formulation of such schemes and implementing them is another important function of the Public Administration.

The Public administration is thus not only the protector of the rights of the citizens, they have also become the provider of services for the people. The welfare of the people is now dependent on how effective the public administration functions. And because of this, the modern state is called as an "*Administrative State*." Prof. V.V.Donham had stated, "*If our civilisation fails, it will be mainly because of administration*."

#### **(iv) The Stabilising Role of Civil Service in Society**

According to Prof. Paul Pigors of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the primary function of the public administration is that of stabilising the social institutions. The administrative function ensures the continuity of existing order with minimal effort and risk. Its fundamental aim is to "carry on" rather than venturing into new and untried avenues. Administrators are, therefore, the stabilizers of the society and the guardians of the tradition.

They are stabilizers in both positive and negative sense. In the positive sense, they help in the continuity of the system and help in preserving its principles. But they also act in other ways to frustrate new ideas and developments to change and reform the existing system. They resist change and slow down the rate of experimentation.

#### **(v) Civil Service as a key to Modern Society**

Modern society is considered to be a great society, as it consists as many groups connected together to achieve common objective. Every institution in a great society, and even the great society rests upon the administration. The state, like that of the private enterprises also rest upon the administration. And hence whatever the future might hold, the administration will be an essential instrument in service delivery.

#### **(vi) Civil Service as a Mechanism for Promoting Culture in the Society**

Public administration is not just an instrument of governance, it is also an important instrument used for promoting and preserving the culture of the society. The ideals and the values of the state may be high, and its impact on the lives of the people can only be measured only if these values are put in actual practice. Thus the public administration becomes an important instrument to implement the values and the ideals of the state. By becoming the part of social and cultural life of the people, it has become a permanent force in determining the character and activities of the state itself. Hence, Waldo calls administration as, "*part of the cultural complex which is not only acted upon but which also acts*."

#### **(vii) Civil Service– a Fourth Branch of Government**

Till the 19th century the role of state was of regulatory nature, and public administration did not play vital role in the lives of the people. It acted as an instrument of coercion and control rather than doing public service.

Because of the increase in complexity of society, the role of the State has changed, there is increase in nature and volume of functions concerning the social change and development. Welfare of the people is now considered to be paramount.

The era of *laissez faire* state has come to an end, and now a positivist-interventionist welfare state has emerged in its place. This therefore has enhanced the importance of public administration. Hence scholars related to the public administration gave a separate status to the public administration, they not just separated it from the politics, but they called it as the *fourth branch* of government along with the executive, legislature and the judiciary.

**(viii) Increasing Role of Civil Service in Policy Making** The modern welfare state has added new dimensions of role to public administration. Thus the nature of role played by the bureaucracy in policy making is changing slowly. The **concept of neutrality** of civil servants is also losing its significance.

> The public administration is playing an important role in policy making in various way. It helps the executive in identifying the areas for policy making, they prepare the policy proposals, analyse various alternative and solutions available, dividing the major policy into various sub-policies, formulating programmes of actions and various modifications required in the existing policies.

The public administration is the only possible and effective instrument that could be used to formulate and implement the policies which the modern government is called upon to address. In the present era, the chief function of an administrator is considered to be policy making.

#### **Theories relating to Bureaucracy (Civil Service)**

#### **Weber's Bureaucracy**

Max Weber was the first scholar to make a systematic analysis of bureaucracy as a system of organisation. The credit for systematic formulation of bureaucratic theory goes to him. His classic study provides for the starting point for the analysis of bureaucracy. As already seen, we have studied the formulation as given by Hegel, but his he has not explicitly mentioned about bureaucracy and his theory generally was not about bureaucracy. Hence Max Weber was the first person the separate the sphere of bureaucracy from the political system and study it.

#### **Hegel's Theory**

Hegel in his book *Philosophy of Right* talks about the nature of state, and the philosophical basis of existence of state. He talks about the system which exists outside the formal state setup, that is, the family and the civil society. And according to Hegel the civil servants carry the value of the society from which they come from. They have affinity towards the family and also become member of the civil society and finally raise to be a civil servant. The class division in the society integrates the society and not divides it. Hegel places the civil servants into the middle class, and he considers the middle class to be balancing factor in the society, and calls it the 'pillar of the state'.

- **1.** Hegel acknowledges the importance of division of labour and power in a public authority.
- **2.** He states about the important role played by the civil servants in the government.
- **3.** He ruler shall be aid and advised by the ministry and civil service, and all these member should satisfy the educational requirements.
- **4.** According to Hegel the society is divided into three classes based on the division of labour.

- **a.** The agriculture- substantial or immediate class
- **b.** The business- reflecting or formal class
- **c.** The civil servants- universal class

Such a membership is essential for gaining status and recognition in a civil society.

- **5.** The Civil servants or the bureaucracy is considered to be a "universal class" because it concerns with the universal interests of the society.
- **6.** As members of the bureaucracy they are paid salary by the state. They have to be highly educated and must qualify for the appointment to government posts on the basis of merit. They are also provided with safety of tenure and hence are independent of immediate political pressure.
- **7.** The state according to Hegel is the march of god. It is a rational and ethical entity. The Constitutional law according to Hegel is divided into three,
  - **a.** The legislature- establish universal law making
  - **b.** The executive- universal administering of the laws
  - **c.** The Crown- the ultimate decision maker and units the other two arms of the state.

The executive consists of the civil servants and the other higher advisory officials.

The government has its own division of labour whereby the administration is divided into various departments managed by special officials.

The appointment is made on the basis of knowledge and ability. The tenure is conditional and based on effective fulfilment of their duties. The offices of the civil servants are open to all class and categories of citizens.

- **8.** The executive does not remain unchecked, to quote Hegel, *"The security of the state and its subjects against the misuse of power by ministers and their officials lies directly in their hierarchical organization and their answerability; but it lies too in the authority given to societies and corporations …."*
- **9.** The qualities of the civil servants will be, being dispassionate, upright and polite. This is because of their proper education in thought and ethical conduct.

- **10.** The civil servants are universal class because
  - **a.** They subsume all the particular classes under the universal class, and therefore reflect universal interest;
  - **b.** Show a disposition of mind, which shuns selfish ends for effective discharge of public functions to achieve universal public good.

The Hegelian concept of bureaucracy is identical to that of Weber's Ideal type conception.

- **a.** Tenured system of bureaucracy
- **b.** Motivated to the service of the commonwealth and the people
- **c.** Recruited on basis of merit
- **d.** Paid according their performance
- **e.** Autonomy and independent from other spheres
- **f.** Acts as a break on the civil society

## **Characteristics of Bureaucracy Given by Weber**

Weber identified the bureaucracy with the legal-rational authority. According to Weber the essence of bureaucracy is its rational character, that is, it is governed by a set of rules which is easily understood. He saw bureaucracy as an impersonal system operating on the basis of known rules and implemented by full-time appointed officials. Hence the Weberian model of bureaucracy excludes the elected political executives. He regarded the bureauracy based on the legal-rational authority as the most effective basis of an organisation. He saw it as the most efficient organisation form for the administrative purposes.

Weber developed the legal-rational idea type bureaucracy to explain its defining features. The following are the characteristics of the bureaucracy as given by Weber:

- **1.** In a legal sense, each office has a clearly defined sphere of authority.
- **2.** The officials all receive fixed salary in money according to their rank in the hierarchy. They are also eligible to receive a fixed pension.
- **3.** The job is the primary occupation of the official, he has full concentration on it.
- **4.** The official is subject to strict and systematic control and discipline in his conduct in the office.
- **5.** There is a proper career structure, where the promotion is based on the merit and/or seniority. The basis of promotion depends on the judgment of the superior officer.

- **6.** The employees of the bureaucratic organisation are personally free and are subject to restrictions with regard to their impersonal official duties.
- **7.** The administrative offices are arranged hierarchically; that is, each higher office controls and supervises the lower office below it.
- **8.** The officials, are appointed, and not elected, on basis of a free contract. The official is always free to resign.
- **9.** The officials are selected on the basis of technical qualifications as required by each post.
- **10.** The official does not own his/her office and the means of administration. They cannot appropriate their position.

These ten feature constitute Weber's world renowned ideal, pure or most legal rational type bureaucracy. This concept of ideal type bureaucracy is applicable to both private and private administrative systems.

## **Attributes of Bureaucracy**

According to Weber, "*Bureaucracy is by far the most efficient instrument of large scale administration which has ever been developed and the modern social order has become overwhelming dependent on it*." He was of the opinion that a purely bureaucratic form of organisation had the chance and capability to attain the highest level of efficiency.

The following are the important elements of Weber's legal-rational type system.

## **1. Hierarchy- a Formal Structure of Well-defined Authority:**

It is the basic feature in the organisation which defines the position. It is the ranking of various positions in a descending order from the top to the bottom. It is a separation between the superior and the subordinate offices. Each level controls a level below them and in turn is controlled by the level above them. Weber gives greater importance to this characteristic of bureaucracy, "the organisation of offices follows the principle of hierarchy, that is, each lower office is under the control and supervision of a higher one." Thus no office is left uncontrolled in the system. It serves as a line of control and also as delegation of authority.

#### **2. Division of Labour-**

The functioning is divided based on the specialisation. The organisation is thus broken down in basis of such specialised functions. Each employee is given a specific function, and thus becomes a master of it. The area of competence is demarcated. This raises the overall productivity and efficiency of the organisation. Each official thus knows what is function is and what to perform and also what not to perform that is not to encroach upon the functions of others. Another important aspect of division of labour is that it makes sure that no area is left uncovered.

#### **3. Rules-**

The official function is carried out on basis of the rules. And these rules operate in reference only to the official job only. The emphasis is laid upon the rules in order to avoid the arbitrariness, personal favour etc. which may hinder the working of the organisation. The rules enable the decision taken at higher levels get implemented at the lower levels. The rules help in maintaining the uniformity and also in coordination of the efforts in the organisation. Thus rules help in stability, continuity and probability of the system, and each one knows the outcome of their action.

#### **4. Impersonality-**

Irrational sentiments have to be avoided in any organisations, especially a public organisation such as Bureaucracy. The officials should discard their personal likes, dislikes etc. while performing their official duty. There has to be no bias while performing such tasks for the government. Every employee and the other people should be treated equally on par with each other. Thus decisions, should be governed by rational factors and not personal factors. And impersonality helps in dealing with people both within and outside the organisation.

## **5. Official Records-**

Another important feature of Weberian Bureaucracy is that everything is recorded in writing. The official records are therefore maintained. All the decisions and activities of the organisation are recorded in writing and it is preserved for future reference. The filing system helps in preserving such records.

## **6. Differentiation of Public and Private Ends-**

Personal interests and private ends are kept separate from the public purpose and the function. One's personal interest should never interfere with his official work. The rationality should always be maintained in the organisation. They are paid employees of the organisation, their tenure is determined by official rules and regulations, and they should not have any exclusive interest in the organisation.

These are thus the characteristics of the Bureaucracy as elaborated by Weber. These are not any regular characteristic, but are of an organisation which is 'ideal' which means that it doesn't exist in reality. The characteristics such as **precision, discipline, strictness, continuity and reliability** are the underlining feature of the bureaucracy. These characteristics technically make bureaucracy the most efficient organisation.

## **Reasons for Growth of Bureaucracy (Civil Service)**

Weber was the first person to identify the reasons for the growth of bureaucracy in the West. He identified the following reasons:

- **1. Money Economy:** the development of money economy as the important and foremost reason for the birth and development of bureaucratic system. To quote Weber, "*The development of money economy, in so far as the pecuniary compensation of the official is concerned, is a pre-supposition of bureaucracy*." Weber observed that the bureaucratic organisation would only survive if the money economy develops and a steady economic growth is maintained.
- **2. Emergence of Mass Democracy:** the emergence of larger middle class who are demanding the benefits of the mass democracy, such as the social and economic equality in another important reason for growth of bureaucracy. The impersonal bureaucracy operating based on rules was associated with the negation of practice of according special privilege to a specific group of persons.
- **3. Protestant Ethic:** according to Weber Protestant social ethic contributed to the development and ascendency of bureaucracy. This concept was opposed to traditionalism, old-age customs and methods. It called for working on fullest potential of an individual, not for greed or pursuit of pecuniary gain. Such new kind of ethos helped in modernisation of the economy, increase in production and productivity. This ethics also developed rational planning, personal discipline, technology and finally the bureaucratic organisation.
- **4. Capitalist System:** the system based on ruthless competition played an important role in the development of bureaucracy. A system of highly effective bureaucracy was needed to maintain the competition in the free market economy. The bureaucracy was the most efficient instrument which could be used to achieve the organisational goals.

Thus all these factors were responsible for the growth and development of bureaucracy in the modern age.

## **Marxian Criticism**

The concept of bureaucracy was not central to Marx's thoughts. But he made a detailed study about the bureaucratic system in his "*Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right*". He had devoted an entire section on bureaucracy. He had expressed his views on the structure, function and the relationship of bureaucracy with the state and the society. He analysed the system as a set of relationships that arise because of the prevailing socio-economic context. Hence the conceptualisation of Marx's bureaucracy has to be understood within his general framework of his theory of class conflict, crisis of capitalism and the advent of communism.

Marx introduced the idea of bureaucracy in his criticism of Hegel's conception of executive authority of the state. Marx rejected the positive picture of state as presented by Hegel. According to Marx, the state does not represent the general interest of the people, rather it projects and serves only the interest of the dominant class in the society. And in the capitalist system, the state was the handmaiden of the dominant capitalist class.

Hence according to Marx,

- Bureaucracy is an instrument of domination used by the dominant class to exercise control over the lower class in the society.
- Interest of the bureaucracy is linked to that of the dominant class and the state.
- The bureaucracy is not functional as said by Hegel, it arises from the pathological division of labour in the society. It is an instrument of perpetual exploitation of the weaker sections of the society.
- In a capitalist society, the bureaucracy works to support and consolidate the class division and domination.
- The bureaucracy constitutes a particular, closed group within the state. It has its own interest which it defends against the other classes in the society.
- It uses the power to promote and sustain its own private ends. It does not act to achieve general interest of the society.
- The true purpose and intention of the state is cloaked in secrecy, mechanist action, and the faith in the authority.
- The objective of the bureaucracy becomes, securing higher position in the hierarchy, and making a better career. Hence the bureaucrats treat state as their private property.

- The information and other resources are manipulated to serve the interests of the dominant group.
- Another important character of bureaucracy is the hierarchy, according to Marx, *"….its hierarchy is a hierarchy of knowledge. The top entrusts the understanding of detail to the lower levels, whilst the lower levels credit the top with understanding of the general, and so, all are mutually deceived. Comprehensive knowledge is not possible in such a situation where knowledge is deliberately split up*."
- Another important characteristic of bureaucracy is its secrecy. It carries out all its actions in secrecy to achieve its objective of privatising the civil society. Political consciousness is considered to be a treason. The spirit of mystery is preserved internally through hierarchy and externally through the nature of closed society. As Marx states, the truth is that bureaucracy captures and hold the substance of the state.

- The bureaucracy becomes autonomous and an oppressive force.
- The bureaucracy contributes to the alienation of the people. According to Marx, "*even the paper qualification of the bureaucrat are a mark of separation from the rest of the society*."
- Incompetence is another feature of bureaucracy. It is in opposition to Hegel's view that bureaucracy is the most competent authority in the society.
- According to Marx, the bureaucracy leads a parasitic existence. It does not occupy an organic position in the society divided between the exploiter and the exploited. He simply calls it a 'parasitic body' used to maintain the status quo and privileges of the dominant class in the society.
- Bureaucracy is inseparable from the state. And it is integral part of the exploitative system. And hence it will not exist in a communal system of governance.

#### **Generalist vs Specialists debate**

The generalists and specialists are two important formulation of civil service in India. The proper relationship between them is essential for effective functioning of the civil service. But there has always undying issues between these two since the days of independence.

## **Meaning of the Term**

A generalist civil servant does not possess a specialised qualification but is well equipped with the administrative procedures, rules and regulations and hence can be appointed to any administrative field.

He belongs to the managerial class, and performs activities such as planning, organising, coordinating, budgeting, staffing, directing, supervising and controlling.

Thus the civil servant who makes policies, coordinates, supervises and controls the administration is called as **generalists**. An IAS officer is a generalist civil servant par excellence.

As R.B.Jain observed, "*In his professional capacity a generalist possess the skill and techniques of the manager and a kind of politician. As a manager he is responsible for getting things done, and as a politician, he is responsible for interpreting the minds of the people to the complex social, economic and even political problems of the state within the constraints of the administrative system*."

A specialised civil servant on the other hand, is the one who holds special knowledge or skill in a particular area. He is a professional expert in that area. Thus like a generalist, he is not an all-rounder. The specialist areas include that of the engineers, doctors, educationists, economists, police, agriculturalists etc.

#### **Categorisation of Civil Service in India**

The civil service in India can be categorised into technical and non-technical fields. The recruitment for the specialised services takes place based on basis of such specialised and professional qualifications. Hence the technical services need subject and professional experts from that particular field. The following are some of the services that require professional expertise,

- Indian Economic Service;
- Indian Statistical Service;
- Indian Forest Service;
- Central Engineering Service;
- Central Meteorological Service and so on.

The non-technical services are those for which the recruitment are carried out on basis of general educational qualifications. It is open to all candidates who have the necessary minimum qualification. These services include the following,

- Indian Administrative Service;
- Indian Foreign Service;
- Indian Police Service;
- Indian Revenue Service;
- Indian Audit and Account Service and so on.

These non-technical services can be further classified into functional and general purpose services. For the functional services the people get selected and remain in their service throughout their career all other services except the IAS falls into the category of functional non-technical service.

Hence IAS is the only general purpose service. The members of this cadre occupy all the top most administrative positions in the country. There is no separate functional field of occupation for the IAS cadre.

#### **Areas of Controversy**

The controversy between the generalists and the specialists relate to the following aspects,

- The entry to top posts are generally denied to the members of specialist service. Most of these top posts are occupied by members of the IAS, which is a generalist service.
- At the regional level specialised posts such as the Divisional Commissioner, Command Area Development Commissioner Etc. are all occupied by generalists.
- The generalists enjoy more proximity to the political heads than the specialists.
- The district is headed by the Collector, who is a 'generalist civil servant par excellence'. At the district level there are number of other institutions which are headed by specialists. Hence generalist heads team of specialists.
- The specialists are hence considered to be the subordinates of the generalists. The views, opinions and advice are not taken by the IAS- generalist service from the specialists.
- There is wide possibility of inter-organisational mobility by the generalists, than that of the specialists. The IAS officers can move from one department to another, or to a public enterprise, or local government etc. while there is no such scope for the generalists who can only move within their own departments.
- The pay and service conditions of the generalists are much more attractive than that of the specialists. This is the most important grievance of the specialists.
- Below the secretariat level, the departments are generally manned by the specialists, but sometimes, a generalist is appointed as the head of a technical department, such as Director of Health, Animal Husbandry etc.
- The generalists have a quicker and better chance of promotion and career development than the specialists.
- All the performance appraisal of the specialists is carried out by the generalist IAS officers.

Hence the above mentioned controversy has led to discontentment amongst the services. And thus has affected the morale and efficiency.

## **The Case for the Generalists**

The following points are in support of the generalists,

- **a.** The tenure system in the secretariat whereby, on rotation the people with the field experience are appointed, requires generalist administrators.
- **b.** A generalist can act as a mediator between the political head and the specialist, between the government and the people, between the pressure groups and public interest.
- **c.** The specialists are narrow-minded and are experts only in a particular field. They "know more and more about less and less". As Paul H. Appleby stated, "the price of specialisation of every kind is parochialism". Hence the generalist, on the other hand, have a broader outlook and flexibility in their approach.
- **d.** The generalists are suited to higher management positions are they are much more experienced, and have high calibre, ability to manage things.
- **e.** There has to be a generalist civil servant at all positions to carry on managerial functions.

## **The Case for Specialists**

The following is in support and favour of specialist entry and greater role in the field of administration,

- **a.** The IAS officers are considered to be the "Jack of all and Master of none". They are not equipped to deal with technical aspects related to administration.
- **b.** In the present setup, the political head is deprived of technical and subject matter advice.
- **c.** The generalists are not aware of the realities in the field, hence the policies formulated by them are unrealistic and un-implementable. Only the specialists know the difficulty of implementing and the problems faced by the people in the field.
- **d.** The earlier era of 'intelligent amateur theory' does not hold good in the present times. The functions related to administration has become much more complex, technical and subject specific, hence only a specialist can deal with them effectively.
- **e.** The generalists are not suitable for policy making as they do not have sufficient knowledge and understanding required to resolve the problems plaguing the society.

## **Minister-Civil Servant Relationship**

The Second ARC Report in its 10th Report states the following regarding the Minister-civil servant relationship, A healthy working relationship between Ministers and civil servants is critical for good governance. While the principles governing the roles and responsibilities of Ministers and civil servants are well defined in political theory, in the actual working of this relationship this division of responsibility becomes blurred with both sides often encroaching upon the other's sphere of responsibility. In any democracy, Ministers are responsible to the people through Parliament and therefore the civil servants have to be accountable to the Minister. However, an impartial civil service is responsible not only to the government of the day but to the Constitution of the land to which they have taken an oath of loyalty. At the same time, implementing the policies of the duly elected government is a core function of civil servants. That is why the division of responsibility between the civil servants and ministers needs to be more clearly defined. A framework in which responsibility and accountability is well defined would be useful.

## **Constitutional Provisions in India**

The Indian Constitution provides for separation of powers between the legislature, executive and judiciary with welldefined roles and responsibilities for each one of them. Since India is a parliamentary democracy, there is an interface between the legislature and the executive at the level of the Council of Ministers, which is collectively responsible to the legislature. In terms of Articles 53 and 154, the executive power of the Union and the States vests in the President or Governor directly or through officers subordinate to him. These officers constitute the permanent civil service and are governed by Part XIV of the Constitution.

The Rules of Business of Government do provide for the Secretary to the Government to advise his/her Minister about the course of action proposed in a particular matter and to submit to him a note which tells him about the propriety or legality of his/her orders and suggest that either such orders not be given or that they be suitably modified. The relationship between the Secretary and the Minister is organic. The Minister has the mandate of the people to govern, but the Secretary has an equivalent constitutional mandate to advise the Minister. Once his/her advice has been suitably considered, unless the Minister passes an illegal order, the Secretary is bound to implement it. The Minister, on his/her part, is required to support the Secretary who is implementing his/her order. Once a law is framed or rules and regulations are approved, they apply to everyone, whether a member of the political executive or of the permanent civil service**. A civil servant is required to implement the orders of government without bias, with honesty and without fear or favour**. It is precisely in this area that a degree of a difference of opinion often occurs between the political executive and the civil servants.

#### **Civil Service in Post Independent India**

In the initial years after Independence, relations between Ministers and civil servants were characterized by mutual respect and understanding of each other's respective roles, with neither encroaching upon the other's domain. However, in subsequent years, matters started changing for the worse. While some civil servants did not render objective and impartial advice to their Ministers, often some Ministers began to resent advice that did not fit in with shortterm political interests. There was also a tendency for some Ministers at the Union and the State levels to focus more on routine administrative matters such as transfers in preference to policy making. At the same time, some civil servants learnt the art of 'manoeuvring' for favours in return for pliability in their decision making. This trend was further accentuated by rising materialism and acquisitiveness in society as well as decline in values across the board. As a result, 'political neutrality' which was the hallmark of the civil service in the pre-Independence era as well as in the period right after Independence, was gradually eroded. These trends led to the phenomenon of 'politicisation of the civil service' in India.

## **Areas of Friction**

The areas of potential conflict in the relationship between the political executive and the permanent civil service can be identified as follows:

- **a.** The concept of neutrality
- **b.** Advisory role of civil servants in policy making
- **c.** Statutory role of the civil servants
- **d.** Discharge of delegated functions
- **e.** Transfers and postings of civil servants

#### **a. The Concept of Neutrality**

Sardar Patel had made the following observations in the Constituent Assembly to support the continuance of the pre-independence civil service structure:-

*"It needs hardly to be emphasized that an efficient, discipline and contended civil service assured of its prospects as a result of diligent and honest work, is a sine-qua non of sound administration under democratic regime even more than under an authoritarian rule. The service must be above party and we should ensure that political considerations,*  *either in its recruitment or in its discipline and control, are reduced to the minimum if not eliminated altogether."*

Unfortunately, this vision of civil service neutrality no longer holds good. Changes in governments particularly at the state level often lead to wholesale transfer of civil servants. Political neutrality is no longer the accepted norm with many civil servants getting identified, rightly or wrongly, with a particular political dispensation. There is a perception that officers have to cultivate and seek patronage from politicians for obtaining suitable positions even in the Union Government. As a result, the civil services in public perception are often seen as increasingly politicized.

The Commission is of the view that the political neutrality and impartiality of the civil services needs to be preserved. The onus for this lies equally on the political executive and civil servants. The Commission in its Report on "Ethics in Governance" while examining the ethical framework for Ministers has recommended that a code of ethics for Ministers should inter-alia include the following:

*"Ministers must uphold the political impartiality of the civil service and not ask the civil servants to act in any way which would conflict with the duties and responsibilities of the civil servants."*

As observed by Paul Appleby civil servants should not confuse 'political neutrality' with 'programme neutrality'. At the stage of policy formulation, the role of civil servants is to render free and frank advice which should not be coloured by any political considerations. Once a policy or programme has been approved by the elected government, it is the duty of the civil servant to faithfully and enthusiastically see to its implementation. Not carrying out this task in the right spirit would amount to misconduct inviting appropriate sanctions.

#### **b. Advisory Role of Civil Servants in Policy Making**

Rendering policy advice to the political executive is the most important "staff function" of the civil servant. Policy making is the ultimate responsibility of the Minister. After a policy is approved by the elected government, it is duty of the civil servant to implement such policy in the right earnest whether he/she agrees with it or not. At the same time, it is the duty of the civil servant to provide the factual basis, thorough analysis of all possible implications of any measure under consideration and free and frank advice, without fear or favour, at the stage of policy formulation. It is unfortunate that at times senior civil servants get bogged down in routine administrative decision making and are unable to contribute adequately to this crucial aspect of their functions. However, for civil servants to be able to provide appropriate policy inputs, they must acquire the necessary combination of a broad perspective of the sector as well as of the Government as a whole, combined with conceptual clarity and requisite knowledge.

If a policy that is being formulated is perceived by the civil servant to be against public interest, his/her responsibility is to convince the political executive about the adverse implications of such a policy. However, if the political executive does not agree with such an advice, there is little that the civil servant can do other than putting his/her views clearly on record. It is for the other institutional mechanisms such as Parliament, the CAG, Judiciary and ultimately the electorate to hold the political executive to account for bad policy

#### **c. Statutory Role of the Civil Servants**

Civil servants are required to discharge statutory functions under various legislative enactments which may sometimes be quasi-judicial in nature. The role of the executive magistrate under the Cr. PC, the role of an Assessing Officer under the Income Tax Act and of the SHO under the Cr.PC and the respective Police Acts are some examples of such functions. It has been observed that there is an increasing trend on the part of the senior functionaries both in the civil services as well as elected representatives including Ministers to interfere in such statutory functions. Acquiescence in the face of such interference is primarily the fault of the officer who has been entrusted with these statutory functions although those bringing such extraneous pressures should also be held to account.

#### **d. Discharge of Delegated Functions**

In a democracy, the ultimate executive authority for all purposes lies with the political executive which is accountable to the people through Parliament. However, like in any large organization, Government also has to function through a hierarchy of functionaries to carry out defined tasks at different levels and in different locations. This necessitates on practical considerations the delegation of authority and responsibility to the civil servants at different levels in government. Such delegation is in line with the principles of subsidiarity which helps to take government closer to the people. The principles of sound management demand that authority and responsibility should go hand-in-hand.

It has been observed that there is an increasing tendency in government departments to centralize authority and also after having first delegated authority downwards, to interfere in decision making of the subordinate functionaries. This is an unfortunate trend and it is for those holding leadership positions in government both in the political executive and in the civil services to correct it since such centralization leads to inefficiencies and poor service delivery. It is also for the legislature to correct this trend by means of legislative enactments in certain critical areas as has been done for local bodies through Constitutional amendments (73rd and 74th) followed by State laws.

#### **e. Postings and Transfers of Civil Servants**

The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution made the following observations regarding transfers and postings of civil servants:

*"Arbitrary and questionable methods of appointments, promotions and transfers of officers by political superiors also led to corrosion of the moral basis of its independence. It has strengthened the temptation in services to collusive practices with politicians to avoid the inconvenience of transfers and to gain advantages by ingratiating themselves to political masters. They would do the politicians' biddings rather than adhere to rules. Lest the situation becomes more vicious, it is necessary that a better arrangement be conceived under the Constitution. The question of appointments, transfers and placements is not to be left to the discretion of the politicians or administrative bosses but be entrusted to independent and autonomous boards. The Commission, therefore, recommends that the questions of personnel policy including placements, promotions, transfers and fast-track advancements on the basis of forward-looking career management policies and techniques should be managed by autonomous Personnel Boards for assisting the high level political authorities in making key decisions. Such civil service boards should be constituted under statutory provisions. They should be expected to function like the UPSC. Reputed management experts from institutes of management, well known for their excellence, should be inducted into these boards to provide a broad based pool of expertise. The principle is not to take politics out*  *of personnel policy but to make knowledge and information institutionally available to the political decision-makers on the basis of appropriate parliamentary legislation under Article 309. The sanctity of parliamentary legislation under Article 309 is needed to counteract the publicly known trends of the play of unhealthy and destabilizing influences in the management of public services in general and higher civil services in particular."*

Arbitrary and motivated transfers of government servants which are not in public interest and good governance have become a matter of great concern particularly in some States although the position is somewhat better at the Union Government level.

### **Minister Vs Civil Servant**

*Pfiffner* has elaborated about the difference in activities of the Minister and the Civil servant, they are as follows,

| Minister                                                                                                                                                                | Civil Servant                                                                                                                                                                              |

## **The Concept of Ministerial Accountability to Parliament**

The Public Service Committee in the Britain recommended the following as a working definition of Ministerial Accountability:

*Ministers owe a fundamental duty to account to Parliament. This has, essentially, two meanings. First, that the executive is obliged to give an account—to provide full information about and explain its actions in Parliament so that they are subject to proper democratic scrutiny ….*

*Second, a Minister's duty to account to Parliament means that the executive is liable to be held to account: it must respond to concerns and criticisms raised in Parliament about its actions because Members of Parliament are democratically elected representatives of the people. A Minister's effective performance of his functions depends on his having the confidence of the House of Commons….*

The Committee also considered that, as part of ministers' obligation to explain their actions to Parliament, they should make civil servants available to committees.

The following is the Resolution recommended on ministerial accountability:

- **1.** Ministers have a duty to Parliament to account, and be held to account, for the policies, decisions and actions of their Department and Next Steps Agencies;
- **2.** It is of paramount importance that Ministers give accurate and truthful information to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity. Ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister.
- **3.** Ministers should be as open as possible with Parliament, refusing to provide information only when disclosure would not be in the public interest, which should be decided in accordance with relevant statute and the Government's Code of Practice on Access to Government Information (Second Edition, January 1997);
- **4.** Similarly, Ministers should require civil servants who give evidence before Parliamentary Committees on their behalf and under their directions to be as helpful as possible in providing accurate, truthful and full information in accordance with the duties and responsibilities of civil servants as set out in the Civil Service Code (January 1996).

It can be seen that the resolution gives civil servants duties toward Parliament only in carrying out the requirements of their ministers.

As the Committee concluded "*it is not possible absolutely to distinguish an area in which a minister is personally responsible, and liable to take blame, from one in which he is constitutionally accountable. Ministerial responsibility is not composed of two elements which have a clear break between the two"*.

#### **Anonymity of Civil Servants**

The word anonymity means that the Civil Servants work behind the curtain without taking any praise or blame. Mohit Bhattacharya States, "*Anonymity meant that the civil servant would merely advice the politician from behind and would be protected from being exposed to the din and fury of the politics*."

The concept of anonymity requires that the Minister answer for the actions of the civil servants working under him in the parliament, and thus protect him from the criticism from the parliamentarians. **This means that the minister assumes total responsibility for all the acts of omissions and commissions of the civil servant working under him**.

The minister is the head of the ministry/department concerned and is politically responsible for its acts. He is mainly concerned with the policy making and consults his secretary on these aspects. The course of action is the prerogative of the minister. Hence he is completely responsible for the positive or negative results of the policy and not the secretary.

Therefore, the concept of anonymity is counterpart to the concept of Ministerial responsibility. This means that both these concepts go hand in hand together.

India and Britain follow the Parliamentary form of government. The concept of collective responsibility is the bedrock of the existence of parliamentary democracy. This means that the executive are responsible to the Parliament for all their acts and functions. Hence the principle of Ministerial Responsibility states that the Minister has to be responsible for the policy decisions he takes and should protect the civil servant from being exposed to the questions in the Parliament.

This concept of anonymity functions only in cases of legal and proper acts carried out by the civil servant. And thus does not protect in cases of illegal and improper acts. The Minister has to thus protect the civil servant who has acted to implement the policy within the legal boundaries. He need not protect those who are guilty of abuse of authority for personal ends or other illegal or criminal acts. In all such cases the civil servant is guilty and is held personally responsible for his actions.

As the civil service is governed by the concept of anonymity it is not accountable to the Parliament. But it is accountable to its political executives. The minister since he is answerable to the parliament, makes the civil servant answerable to him. The scheme of accountability is so distributed that, the Minister is accountable to the Parliament and the Civil servant is accountable to the Minister.

The Chagla Commission was constituted after the Mundhra Scandal to enquire into the issue concerning the Life insurance Corporation of India made to by private shares. The commission held in its report that, "*constitutionally the minister is responsible for the action taken by his secretary. He cannot take shelter behind them nor can he disown their actions*." Thus the Chagla commission upheld the principle of Ministerial Responsibility and the concept of anonymity of civil service.

#### **Civil Service Neutrality**

Neutrality implies political impartiality or non-political nature of the civil service. It means that the civil servants should remain poltially neutral and be non-political and serve the government of the day impartially. They should render free and frank advice to the executives without any consideration. They should be,

- Objective
- Apolitical
- Dispassionate
- Non-partisan
- Professional

And should do their job with efficiency, loyalty, integrity and dedication.

According to Mohit Bhattacharya, neutrality means, 'a kind of political sterilisation, the bureaucracy remaining unaffected by the changes in the flow of politics….There might be changes in political leadership, but the civil servant would be unfailingly offering "technical" advice to the political master keeping himself aloof from the "politics" of the day.'

According to R.B.Jain, "*Political neutrality not only meant the absence of political activity or bias on the part of the individual member of the bureaucracy but also that the bureaucracy would respond to the will of the government, no matter what its political complexion be*."

## **Assumptions Based on which Neutrality is Envisaged**

The following are the assumptions based on which the political neutrality is advocated.

- **a.** In a liberal democracy having multi-party system, the government and the party governing changes generally after every elections. Hence under these circumstances, the neutrality of civil service is precondition for the efficient functioning of the government. Thus it helps in serving the government of the day with same vigour and enthusiasm.
- **b.** The neutrality rests on the basic principle of merit system. As the civil servants are recruited through a formal system, they do no owe their allegiance to any political party. This helps them to remain neutral, nonpartisan and serve the government effectively.
- **c.** According to Gerald E. Caiden, the merits of the neutral bureaucracy, viz. continuity, permanency, professionalism, and reliability far outweigh the disadvantages such as, incrementalism, conservatism and reluctance to change.
- **d.** According to Masterman Committee, "*the public interest demands, maintenance of political impartiality in the civil service and of confidence in that impartiality as an essential part of the structure of the government*."
- **e.** The 'spoils system' and the 'politicised bureaucracy' are not the desirable alternatives of a 'neutral bureaucracy', which is permanent and laudable.
- **f.** According to the UN handbook, political neutrality, "*is an essential complement to the merit system, for it guarantees that the career officials…will give the government, whatever its political make up, absolutely impartial advice, criticism and assistance in any matter which concerns it."*

## **Breakdown of The Concept of Neutrality**

The concept of neutrality is presently not in vogue. Though it was thought to be an essential characteristic, a number of factors have caused for it to change. According to R.B.Jain the following are the reasons for the breakdown of the concept of neutrality in civil service:

- **1.** The decision making in the policy initiatives is not the prerogative of the political executives alone, the civil servants play an important role in such decision making process.
- **2.** The civil servants are involved in the sphere of politics via policy formulations, implementations, its execution

and legislation, these acts are generally political and is difficult to distinguish it from non-political acts.

- **3.** Civil servants being humans is difficult to be remain neutral in all scenarios, issues and problems. There is always some degree of subjective bias in issues affecting them, which cannot be eliminated from their judgments.
- **4.** During the performance appraisal of the top-civil servants an element of political assessment comes in.
- **5.** The civil servant assume the role of the leadership, and this is especially so in the developing countries which are engaged in socio-economic upliftment and restructuring.

## **Problems of Bureaucratisation**

Though the bureaucracy leads to efficiency, it also on the other hand leads to other problems. The following are some of the problems that arise because of the bureaucratisation:

- Bureaucratisation results in emphasis of routine and detail in work, this results in red tape or delay.
- The bureaucracy has a tendency to keep on expanding, and hence in course of time the funding to a large extent goes for the payment of the bureaucrats instead of meeting the developmental objectives.
- In developing countries, since other organs of governance, such as the civil society, pressure groups etc. are not well established, hence the bureaucracy acts without any restraint with no one to control or question them.
- The politicians are amateurs and often have to heed the advice of the much experienced and knowledgeable civil servants.
- The aim of the politicians generally is to formulate the policy for the people and they are responsible for them, the civil servants on the other hand have no such compulsion, they are thus work for their own self-aggrandizement.
- It is generally understood that the bureaucracy has to be under the control of the elected representatives. But in the developing countries the bureaucracy is more powerful and holds the political office below them.
- In some of the countries, the military and the civil servants remove the democratically elected government and assume power themselves and start ruling the country. Such dictatorship can be seen in some developing countries.
- Lack of professionalism and poor capacity building
- Inefficient incentive systems that rewards the corrupt and the incompetent and not the upright and honest.
- Outdated rules and procedures that limit the civil servant from performing effectively.

- Systemic discrepancies in promotion and empanelment
- Lack of proper transparency and accountability procedures - there is also no safety for whistle blowers
- Arbitrary and capricious transfers insecurity in tenures impedes institutionalization
- Political interference and administrative submission
- A gradual erosion in values and ethics
- Patrimonialism

## **PRACTICE QUESTIONS**

- **1.** Discuss some of the conflict areas between the political executives and the civil servants in India. Why is it necessary to overcome the problems?
- **2.** Examine the reasons behind the government's move to promote lateral entry in civil service. What measures could be considered to overcome the present problems in civil service?
- **3.** Indian democracy has the advantage of efficient civil service and organized political party. Elaborate.
