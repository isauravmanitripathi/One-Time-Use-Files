# **HUMAN RESOURCE**

# Introduction

The Government is committed to provide equitable access to quality education to all, across all levels from primary to university level, for which reforms are undertaken in the education sector as a continuous and ongoing process. The 42nd Constitutional Amendment, 1976, brought about a fundamental change by transferring education from the State List to the Concurrent List recognizing the federal structure of our country and giving equal responsibility to both the Central and State Governments to promote education. Recognizing the centrality of states both in policy formulation and effective implementation of education reforms, the Ministry of HRD has been regularly convening meetings of the Central Advisory Board on Education (CABE), which is a composite body and is also the highest advisory body on education. All the schemes implemented by the Government of India are in consultation with the States which meet regularly through the meetings of CABE. Similarly, all reform initiatives are also through consensus evolved between the Centre and the States through the CABE.

Presently, various initiatives, such as, the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), ICT in Schools, Centrally Sponsored Scheme on Teacher Education (CSSTE), Shaala Siddhi, Rashtriya Avishkar Abhiyan are being implemented which envisage significant reforms in the elementary education and secondary education. In higher education also, Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA), Global Initiative for Academics Network (GIAN), Impacting Research, Innovation & Technology (IMPRINT), Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme(TEQIP), Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya National Mission on Teachers and Teaching (PMMMN-MTT), Study Webs of Active-Learning for Young Aspiring Minds (SWAYAM), National Digital Library, Campus Connect Programme, Uchhatar Avishkar Abhiyan, Unnat Bharat Abhiyan are being implemented to improve the quality of higher education in the country. A number of initiatives are also undertaken by UGC and AICTE for quality improvement in higher and technical education. With a view to improving the competitiveness of the

higher educational institutions, the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) has been launched.

The recent budget announcements refer to reforms in UGC for promoting greater administrative and academic autonomy and revised framework for outcome-based accreditation and credit-based programmes; leveraging Information Technology and launching 350 online courses through SWAYAM platform; and establishing a National Testing Agency to conduct all entrance examinations for higher education institutions.

It is to be noted that necessary budgetary allocations are provided both for effective implementation of the schemes and also for the proposed reform initiatives.

Currently, the process of formulating a New Education Policy is underway which may propose several reforms in examinations, governance, regulation, school standards, teachers & faculty, literacy and lifelong learning, skills and employability, quality assurance, internationalization, research, curricula, innovation, etc., so as to build an education system that promotes equitable access to quality education to all sections of the society.

# **Making Higher Education Relevant to the Needs of Society and Industry**

The University Grants Commission (UGC) has informed that it has launched the following schemes for making higher education relevant to the needs of the society and industry, namely: Career Oriented Courses (COC), Community Colleges (CC), introduction of degrees in vocational subjects and Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Knowledge Acquisition and Upgradation of Skilled Human Abilities and Livelihood (KAUSHAL) centres in line with National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF). The UGC, through collaboration with National Mission on Education thought ICT (NMEICT), has undertaken e-content development of postgraduate programmes called e-PG Pathashala.

The (UGC) undertakes maintenance of standards in teaching and research and quality assurance in Universities, Deemed to be Universities and Colleges through the following mechanisms, namely: framing regulations and schemes and; disbursing grants to the eligible institutions. The UGC has notified several regulations with the objective of sustenance and improvement in the quality of higher education and for undertaking academic reforms. The regulations are available at http://www.ugc.ac.in/page/ UGC-Regulations.aspx. In order to encourage research and development in the country, UGC has laid out schemes, awards, fellowships, chairs and programmes under which financial assistance is provided to institutions of higher education as well as faculty members working therein to undertake quality research, covering areas of knowledge across disciplines, including revival and promotion of indigenous languages. These schemes are at http://www. ugc.ac.in/page/XII-Plan-Guidelines.aspx.

The Central Government has launched several initiatives, such as, National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), Impacting Research, Innovation & Technology (IMPRINT), Uchchtar Avishkar Yojna (UAY), Global Initiative of Academic Networks (GIAN) in the field of education for the qualitative development of education in the country. Under the NIRF, Educational Institutions will be ranked by an independent ranking Agency for which objective criteria has been developed. They shall be ranked separately in fields such as Engineering, Management, Pharma, Architecture, etc. Under the IMPRINT initiative, the Government has taken the initiative to address major engineering challenges through the collaborative efforts of the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and Indian Institute of Science (IISc). Under this, a roadmap is finalised to pursue engineering challenges in 10 technology domains that have large social impact. The objectives of UAY scheme are to promote innovation in IITs addressing issues of manufacturing industries; to spur innovative mindset; to coordinate action between academia and industry and to strengthen labs and research facilities. GIAN scheme is for facilitating partnership between higher educational institutions of the country and other countries. The scheme is aimed at tapping international talent pool of scientists and entrepreneurs.

The Central Government is also implementing the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) for strategic funding and reforms in the State Higher Education sector.

### **Initiatives of Ministry of Human Resource Development**

One of the major achievements, which Ministry of Human Resource Development accomplished during the year 2015, includes achievement of 100% target of completion of construction of separate toilets for boys and girls in schools under Swachh Vidyalaya Abhiyan within 1 year of the announcement made by the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi on August 15, 2014. The year will also be known for technical advancement made by the Ministry by laying emphasis on ICT, leading to launch of a number of initiatives like e-pathshala, Saransh, Shala Siddhi, Shaala Darpan, availability of NCERT books on mobile app, etc.

The year 2015 also saw the Government of India's sincere efforts towards bringing out a New Education Policy to meet the changing dynamics of the population's requirement with regard to quality education, innovation and research, aiming to make India a knowledge superpower by equipping its students with the necessary skills and knowledge and to eliminate the shortage of manpower in science, technology, academics and industry. New Education Policy is being framed after a gap of 23 years.

For the first time, the Government of India is embarking on a time-bound grassroots consultative process, which will enable the Ministry of Human Resource Development to reach out to individuals across the country through over 2.75 lakh direct consultations while also taking input from citizens online.

The year will also be remembered because of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, cracking the top 100 in world University ranking as per *Times High Education* ranking for 2015–16 and IIT, Delhi, also figuring in the top 200 list of QS. In 2017 the same ranking fell to 185 but moved up to 172 in 2018. It has sent a strong message to other Indian Technical Institutes to better their performance in the key areas of academics research and faculty enrichment. A glimpse of major achievements and initiatives of the Department of Higher Education and the Department of School Education & Literacy is given as follows:

# **DEPARTMENT OF SCHOOL EDUCATION & LITERACY**

The Government has proposed to bring the following scheme this year:

# **Samagra Shiksha**

The Union Budget, 2018-19, has proposed to treat school education holistically without segmentation from pre-nursery to Class 12. Samagra Shiksha - an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class 12 has been, therefore, prepared with the broader goal of improving school effectiveness measured in terms of equal opportunities for schooling and equitable learning outcomes. It subsumes the three Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE).

A number of flagship schemes were launched by the Department of School Education and Literacy in the current year.

**Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat (PBBB):** It is a sub-programme of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan launched in August, 2014, with special focus on improving language development and to create interest in mathematics. The two tracks of Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat are: Early reading and writing with comprehension (ERWC) and early mathematics (EM).

As a follow-up to the foundational programme, in 2015– 16 a programme called the *National Reading Initiative* was launched to develop and promote the habit of reading among students in elementary schools, thereby extending the programme up to Class 8. States were provided token funds to plan and implement innovative activities to promote reading. States have designed specific interventions targeting children in Classes 1 and 2 to improve learning outcomes. There are a variety of focussed programmes being currently implemented across the country.

**Children with Special Needs:** With the active support by Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, over 25 lakh children with special needs have been enrolled in elementary education. In order to equip teachers to facilitate classroom transaction and teaching learning of children with special needs, material on curricular adaptations for inclusive classrooms has been developed by NCERT. This material in the form of two handbooks has been developed for teachers both at the primary and upper primary level. All teachers across the country are being oriented in practising such classroom adaptations through teacher training.

**Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan:** This scheme was launched in March, 2009 for augmenting secondary school infrastructure through construction of additional classrooms, laboratories, toilet blocks, drinking water, libraries, etc. Till date, 10,513 new schools have been approved under the scheme. The RMSA Scheme has been revised to subsume the schemes of ICT @schools, Vocationalisation of Secondary Education, Inclusive Education for Disabled at Secondary Stage, and Girls Hostels from the financial year 2014–15. The Integrated RMSA scheme extends the benefit to aided Secondary schools (excluding infrastructure support and teachers and staff salaries) for quality interventions.

The Teacher Education Bureau is focusing on the following main components for improving the quality of teacher education:

- **1. National Curriculum Framework of Teacher Education (NCFTE 2009):** The National Council of Teacher Education (NCTE) has prepared the National Curriculum Framework of Teacher Education (NCFTE 2009). This framework has been prepared in the background of the NCF, 2005, and the principles laid down in the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009.
- **2. In-STEP: Capacity Building Program of Teacher Educators:** Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) and USAID have formulated the In-STEP programme (India Support to Teacher Education Program) under which 110 teacher educators from the eastern and northeastern part of the country have undergone a 3-month fellowship at Arizona State University with the clear purpose of understanding issues related to teacher education.

In addition, the **TESS-India** is another programme for Teacher Educators with collaboration between Department for International Development (DFID) and Ministry of HRD with UK's Open University as the implementing agency.

**3.** The **Centrally Sponsored Scheme on Teacher Education** (CSSTE) puts emphasis on monitoring of the process and outcome parameters in respect of each level of institution, and for the purpose a comprehensive monitoring mechanism has been developed thereof. Joint Review Mission is a part of this monitoring mechanism. Joint Review Missions consisting of experts in Teacher Education have been sent to majority of the states to ensure effective implementation of the Centrally Sponsored Scheme for Teacher Education.

New activities/initiatives under CSSTE Scheme are as follows:

- **(i) Enhanced use of E-Governance** in Teacher Education by National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) for better regulation of the sector.
- **(ii) Accreditation for Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs)** by National Council for Teacher Education for better management and improved quality of teacher education.
- **(iii) Mapping of Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs)** by NCTE to identify the gap areas for effective future planning.

**Digital Gender Atlas for Advancing Girls' Education in India:** It was launched on 8th March 2015. The tool will help identify low-performing geographic pockets for girls, particularly from marginalised groups.

**Udaan:** This Scheme is dedicated to the development of girl child education, so as to promote the admission of girl students. It seeks to enhance the enrolment of girl students in prestigious technical education institutions through incentives and academic support.

**"Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao" programme**, launched on January 20, 2015, has ushered in to encourage education among girl children. The programme is a joint initiative of Ministry of Women and Child Development, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Ministry of Human Resource Development.

**Saransh:** The CBSE Board has launched an on-line facility titled 'Saransh' for affiliated and CBSE schools on 2nd November, 2014. It helps the schools to look at their performance at an aggregate level and at the level of each student. It is an online self-review tool for schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). It allows schools to identify areas of improvement in students, teachers and curriculum and take necessary measures to implement change. It also provides schools with a view of overall and individual student's performance in academic and extracurricular activities.

**Curriculum for yoga** from classes VI to X was released on the occasion of *International Yoga Day in June 2015*.

**Rashtriya Avishkar Abhiyan** was launched on 9th July 2015. This programme is directed towards creating interest among school-going students from classes I to XII in sciences. Model labs would be created all over the country for this purpose. The key activities under this programme include mentoring of elementary and secondary schools by institutions of higher education; forming Maths and Science clubs for children at school and professional development of teachers in order to make teaching of Maths and Science interesting for students. The activities/components of RAA are funded under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan.

**National Conference on ICT in School Education** – The Conference was held on 7th November 2015. During the Conference, e-Pathshala, Saaransh, and National Programme on School Standards and Evaluation Framework (Shala Siddhi) were launched. All these are web portal/mobile app. These apps promise to make learning more interesting, school bags lighter and books available on the go.

The first phase of **"Shaala Darpan Project"** to cover all the 1,099 Kendriya Vidyalayas was launched in June 2015. This programme will be made available as a mobile app which will keep the parents informed of their ward's progress in schools.

**The National Programme on School Standards and Evaluation (NPSSE)–Shaala Siddhi:** In a step towards comprehensive school evaluation as central to improving quality of school education in India, National Programme on School Standards and Evaluation has been initiated by National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), under the aegis of Union Ministry of Human Resource Development. The School Standards and Evaluation Framework (SSEF) has been developed as an instrument for evaluating school performance. This will enable the school to evaluate its performance against the well-defined criteria in a focused and strategic manner.

**E-pathshala:** As a part of the Digital India Campaign, the Ministry of HRD has launched 'e-pathshala' on November 7, 2015 which is a single-point repository of e-resources containing, NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources. CBSE prescribes textbooks published by National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) for classes IX to XII. For classes I to VIII, CBSE although approves syllabus as per pattern of syllabus given by NCERT, it does not prescribe any textbooks for these classes. **The National Curriculum Framework, 2005 (NCF)** stipulates that region-specific books take care of the local context, culture and resources and therefore different books for different regions better relate to the daily lives of the local students.

**Mid-Day Meal Scheme:** The IVR (Interactive Voice Response System) to monitor the daily implementation of Mid-Day Meal scheme was showcased this year during the National Conference on ICT in School Education. There are two recent interventions, such as Tithi Bhojan and Social Audit designed to attract community participation and channelize it for enrichment of Mid-Day Meal Scheme. The Central Government has requested the States to consider the concept of **Tithi Bhojan** for mid-day meals in a suitable manner, to encourage local community participation the programme. **Social Audit**, another intervention under this Scheme, means is a process in which people collectively monitor and evaluate the planning and implementation of the Scheme. It is viewed as an ongoing process of public vigilance. Bihar, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha and Punjab have completed Social Audit. Social Audit is under progress in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.

The Central Government notified 'Mid-Day Meal Rules, 2015', on September 30th, 2015. The Rules inter alia provide for temporary utilization of other funds available with the school for MDM in case school exhausts MDM funds for any reason; Food Security Allowance to be paid to beneficiaries in case of non-supply of meals for specified reasons; and monthly testing of meals on a random basis by accredited Labs to check its quality. These rules and their effective compliance by implementing agencies in the States will ensure better regularity in serving mid-day meals in schools.

**Kala Utsav:** A unique initiative of the Government of India was launched with the theme of 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao'. It provides an opportunity to learn about the art, culture and language of various States and UTs of the country at one place. About 1,400 students from across the country participated in this cultural programme. Teachers, parents and members of jury were also a part of this unique programme.

Kala Utsav seeks to enhance the life skills of the participants and prepare them as ambassadors of Indian culture besides integrating art in education.

### **DEPARTMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION**

A number of schemes related to Department of Higher Education were also launched during the year.

**IMPRINT INDIA** was released on 5th November 2015. It is a Pan-IIT and IISc joint initiative to develop a roadmap for research to solve major engineering and technology challenges in ten technology domains relevant to India. IMPRINT INDIA aims at direct research in the premier institutions into areas of social relevance. Under this, 10 domains have been identified which could substantially impact the living standards of the rural areas: (1) Health care technology, (2) Energy security, (3) Rural urban housing design, (4) Nanotechnology, (5) Water/river system, (6) Advanced materials, (7) Computer science and ICT, (8) Manufacturing technology, (9) Advanced security and (10) Environment/climate change. The research in each of these areas is being coordinated by one IIT. http://imprint-india.org/

**Global Initiative for Academics Network (GIAN), was launched as an initiative to attract the best foreign academics to Indian Universities of Excellence**. The programme has been launched to facilitate the partnership between Higher Education Institutions of India and other foreign universities. Under this, (352) courses are being offered by foreign faculty from 38 Countries. The cost of the travel and honorarium ranging from \$8,000**–**\$12,000 is being met from the scheme funds. These courses are being looked at as a starting point of long-term research collaboration between Indian Institutions and the other Global institutions; and therefore signal a major chapter in the higher education system.

**National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)** has been launched by the Ministry of Human Resource Development on 29th September 2015. The ranking framework evaluates each higher education institution on five broad parameters, namely teaching/learning resources, research, graduation outcomes, outreach/inclusive nature and the public perception. The ranks will be declared on the first Monday of April every year. An independent body is being proposed to undertake this work based on objective and verifiable criteria.

So far, 2,500 institutions covering engineering, management, pharma, architecture and universities have registered for participation in the ranking and are submitting data. Participation in the NIRF would help the Indian educational institutions participate in the world rankings with greater confidence.

**Study Webs of Active-Learning for Young Aspiring Minds (SWAYAM), is a Web portal where Massive Open On-line Courses (MOOCs) will be available on all kinds of subjects. SWAYAM** is the Indian electronic e-education platform which proposes to offer courses from the high school stage to postgraduate stage in an interactive electronic platform. The IT platform for SWAYAM was built and become operational by March 2016 with a capacity to host nearly 2,000 courses. This would provide the best quality education to more than three crore students across the country. The system would allow 10 lakh students using the system concurrently. Once it becomes operational, students from the backward rural areas can access teaching from the best institutes in the country electronically, thereby, raising the overall standards of higher education in the country. SWAYAM-MOOCs project is intended to address the needs of school level 9–12 to undergraduate and postgraduate students, covering all disciplines.

Launch of the **Credit framework for Skills and Education** as per the National Skills Qualification framework paved the way for certification of skills through the formal system and allows for multiple exits and entrance into the education system with scope for vertical and lateral mobility. The CBCS will enable students to take courses of their choice, learn at their own pace, undergo additional courses and acquire more than the required credits, and adopt an interdisciplinary approach to learning. Approval by UGC of the Guidelines for **Choice-Based Credit Framework** provides for more choices for students to opt for employable courses through a system of flexible credits for foundational, elective and core courses. The **status of CBCS** is as follows:

- **1.** All 39 Central Universities are implementing the CBCS system from 2015 to 16.
- **2.** Major State Universities, like Madras University, Chennai; Bharathiar University, Coimbatore; Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirapalli; Osmania University, Hyderabad; University of Bombay, Mumbai; SNDT Women's University, Mumbai; M.S. University of Baroda, Vadodara; Lucknow University, Lucknow; Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar; Himachal Pradesh University, Shimla and Gauhati University, Guwahati, are also going to implement CBCS from the next academic session.

**Saksham Scholarship Scheme:** The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) is implementing Saksham scholarship scheme to provide support to differently abled students to pursue technical education.

Launch of the **Know Your College portal** is to provide informed decision-making opportunity for students along with complete availability of all e-learning resources. A portal called **Know Your College** (KYC) has been started in which the data declared by all the educational institutions is being placed in a public portal and also made available through a mobile application so that the stakeholders can verify the same. It will also work as one-stop shop for all educational resources. More than 40,000 higher educational institutions are already mapped under the KYC.

Under **Campus Connect** programme, all the Central Universities in the country are going to be connected through Wi-Fi network at a cost of approximately `320 crores. Under this, all the classrooms, libraries, laboratories, hostels and places frequented by the students would be connected through a secured Wi-Fi hotspots providing access to the educational and information resources to the students on 24×7 basis. This project completed by June 2016 and implemented by ERNET.

**Promoting Start-ups:** Thirty-seven new start-up parks/research parks would be set up this year with the coordination of Dept of Science and Technology (fund sharing on 50:50 basis) covering all the IITs, NITs and some IIITs/Central Universities. These would incubate the start-ups and hand-hold them till they reach the stage of commercialization, normally for a period of 5 years. IIT Madras Research Park has already become fully functional (it is ready for inauguration by the Prime Minister).

**Unnat Bharat Abhiyan** was launched for connecting higher education and society to enable technology and its use for development of rural areas. Under this, all technical and higher education institutions have been asked to adopt five villages each; identify technology gaps and prepare plans for innovations that could substantially increase the incomes and growth in the rural areas.

**Ucchtar Aavishkar Abhiyaan:** For promotion of innovation, All the IITs have been encouraged to work with the industry to identify areas where innovation is required and come up with solutions that could be brought up to the commercialization level. For this purpose, it is proposed to launch a scheme **Ucchtar Aavishkar Abhiyan** by investing `250 crores every year on identified projects proposed by IITs and NITs. Participation of industry in part-funding the project would be mandatory

**Engineering skills to unemployed youth:** An initiative as a part of the PMKVY is being launched to encourage all the 10,000 technical institutions (engineering and polytechnic) to provide engineering skills (through part-time courses of 6 to 8 months duration) to at least 100 unemployed youths using their infrastructure after college-hours. The training costs would be met by the central government, and the placement of the trained youth is the responsibility of the institution. This is expected to provide high-quality skilled persons required for the Make in India campaign.

**Comprehensive Language Policy:** An Expert Committee on Language was constituted on 29.12.2014 for preparation of Comprehensive Language Policy for the country and it met four times so far.

**Matribhasha Diwas:** Matribhasha Diwas was celebrated on 21.2.2015 to sensitize people about the need of greater use of mother tongues and other Indian Languages for development and progress of the Nation. Hon'ble HRM has inaugurated the programme at Chennai organized by CIIL, Mysore.

On the International front too, addressing The Leaders' Forum on an official visit to UNESCO Headquarters at Paris on 17th November, 2015, then Minister of Human Resource Development Smt Smriti Irani reaffirmed India's commitment to the ideals of UNESCO and to furthering its role and activities. In this context, she recalled the words of Mahatma Gandhi when in 1947 he had expressed the deep Indian interest in the efforts of UNESCO to "secure peace through educational and cultural activities".

**Conference of Commonwealth Education Ministers:** During the 19th Conference of Commonwealth Education Ministers at the Bahamas from 22 to 26 June, 2015, the Ministry of Human Resource offered the following: to set up the Malviya Commonwealth Chair for Cross-Border Teacher Education which will focus on issues pertaining to curriculum development, pedagogy, student assessment, pre-service and in-service teacher training and capacity development; Commonwealth Consortium for Research which can function in collaboration with the Commonwealth Education hub and provide cross funding for research projects which member nations deem appropriate; Strengthening of public institutions to bring about qualitative improvements in education at all levels; Providing e-Learning platform, SWAYAM to host e-courseware developed by Commonwealth of Learning; and Posting of digitized materials of Commonwealth countries on its soon to be established national e-Library.

**Finally, the above flagship programmes, new schemes and innovations of the Ministry of HRD prove beyond doubt that it is playing a significant role in building strong foundations in education. While the Department of School Education & Literacy has its eye set on the universalization of Education and making better citizens out of the country's young brigade, the Department of Higher Education is engaged in establishing world class institutes of learning and providing ample opportunities for research and skill development to ensure that we create the world's largest workforce**.

# **New Education Policy Draft**

# Report of the Committee for Evolution of the New Education Policy

The Committee for Evolution of the New Education Policy (NEP) (Chair: T. S. R Subramanian) submitted its report on May 7, 2016. The Committee was constituted under the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) in October, 2015. The report proposes an Education Policy, which seeks to address challenges faced by the current education system. Key features of the proposed Policy are summarised below

- **Broad objectives of NEP:** The proposed Policy seeks to improve the quality and credibility of education by addressing the implementation gaps.
- **Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE):** The Committee observed that the implementation of ECCE was inconsistent across states. It emphasised the need for all government schools to have facilities for pre-primary education. Hence, it recommended that ECCE for children from 4 to 5 years of age be declared as a right. This would facilitate pre-school education by the government instead of the private sector until children reach 6 years of age.
- **The Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009:** Currently, the norms for infrastructure and quality have been laid down only for private schools. The Committee recommended that the RTE should be amended to provide uniform norms for recognition of both, government and private schools.
- It also recommended extending the RTE provision of common curriculum to minority institutions, which are currently exempted.
- **School exam reforms:** The Committee recommended the usage of scaled scores and percentiles instead of the traditional marking scheme. It suggested that students should be given the choice to pick the difficulty level of the Mathematics and Science exams in Class 10. To reduce the stress levels of students, the Committee proposed online on-demand board exams as opposed to year end exams.
- In addition, the Committee recommended that the policy of no detention should be upheld only till Cass 5 (age 11 years). This would reverse the existing policy of no detention till Class 8 (age 14 years).
- **Teacher Management:** The Committee observed that there has been a steep rise in teacher shortage, absenteeism and grievances. It recommended setting up of an Autonomous Teacher Recruitment Board. It also recommended that teaching license should be subject to renewal every 10 years. For teacher training, a 4-year integrated B.Ed. course should be implemented.
- **ICT in Education:** The Committee noted that the integration of information technology (IT) and the education sector was inadequate despite Computer literacy and studies in schools. It recommended IT be taken up for teacher training, adult literacy, remedial education

and as a learning tool in higher education. This would also include developing online skill-based courses.

- **Vocational education and training:** The Committee recommended scaling up the existing National Skills Qualification Framework to include more students. It recommends expanding and revising the choice of vocational courses in accordance with local opportunities and resources. It also emphasised the need for formal certification by the various Boards of Education for vocational education at par with conventional education.
- Other institutional recommendations:
  - **(i) All India Education Service(IES):** It would be established as an all India service;
  - **(ii) National Higher Education Promotion and Management Act (NHEPMA):** NHEPMA would replace the existing separate laws governing individual regulators in higher education and redefine the role of existing regulatory bodies like UGC and AICTE; and
  - **(iii) National Accreditation Board (NAB):** The NAB will subsume the existing accreditation bodies of National Assessment and Accreditation Council and the National Board of Accreditation and set standards for accreditation. The Committee also recommended mandatory accreditation for technical and medical institutions.

# The Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana—National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM)

• DAY-NRLM is a poverty alleviation scheme implemented by Union Ministry of Rural Development to promote self-employment and organization of rural poor. It was launched as NRLM in 2011 but was succeeded by Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana in 2016. It is supported by World Bank. The Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana–National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM) is making a difference to the lives and livelihoods of over 3.6 crore households from where women have joined Self-Help Groups (SHGs). The collectives of women under SHGs, Village Organisations (VOs) and Cluster Level Federations (CLFs) has evolved transformational social capital that is changing gender relations, access to services and participation in Gram Sabhas and Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). The programme has given confidence to women to seek Bank loans for economic activity after developing skills and competencies through a sustained Community Resource Person (CRP) led handholding for livelihood diversification. A total of 1.50 lakh women Community Resource Persons (CRPs) who have themselves come out of poverty are today the greatest agents of change in promoting sustainable agriculture, providing banking services, developing a cadre

of Para Vets for animal care, bookkeepers and accountants to women's collectives, and most importantly an agent for social transformation of villages.

- Since the inception of the programme in 2011, women members of SHGs have accessed `1.06 lakh crore as Bank credit. From `20,000 crore Bank linkage in 2014–15, SHGs got more than `30,000 crore as credit in 2015–16. Till February 2017 over `29,000 crore had already been disbursed and it is expected that about `35,000 crore to `38,000 crore will be mobilised as credit in the Financial Year 2016–17. Analysis of Bank linkage in 2016–17 shows the remarkable increase in credit linkage in States like Assam, Bihar, Odisha, Rajasthan and West Bengal. There is a clear National spread in Bank linkage as SHGs become vibrant and stronger institutions of the poor in many Northern Indian States as well. They are already strong and vibrant in the Southern Indian States.
- Under the DAY-NRLM, over 30 lakh women farmers have been supported under Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP) to promote sustainable agricultural practices. Women SHG led Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs) for agricultural implements, power tillers, etc., have come up in some States. Vermi Compost/NADEP pits have also come up through the efforts of these women SHG farmers besides the promotion of pesticide free agriculture and multi-tier cropping in rain-fed regions for fodder, food, forest, fruits and fibre.
- The DAY-NRLM programme has reached nearly 1/3rd of the Gram Panchayats of the country and efforts for its consolidation and expansion are being continuously made. During 2017–18, 52 lakh households through 4.5 lakh new SHGs were added to DAY-NRLM. Startup Village Entrepreneurship Programme (SVEP) to develop 84,000 micro enterprises was started in 17 States covering 47 Blocks. Solid Waste Management initiative through convergence was done in 11,000 (nearly 90%) villages of Tamil Nadu through their women SHGs. The successful initiative has been initiated by DAY-NRLM in 6 other States. DAY-NRLM published a Compendium of successful Business Models for Livelihood Diversification and also developed a Best Practice Volume based on National awards and recognition to the best SHGs during the year.
- To facilitate diversification of livelihoods, skill development for Placement Based Wage Employment and self-employment was promoted on a large scale through the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDUGKY) and Rural Self Employment & Training Institutes (RSETIs) respectively under DAY-NRLM. 1.60 lakh youth were trained and 79,400 placed under

DDUGKY besides 4 lakh youth being trained in 585 RSETIs for self-employment in 2016–17. Twelve new Champion Employers were selected under DDUGKY for high quality training and committed placements. Some of the Champion Employers are Cafe Coffee Day, Apollo Mediskills, Team lease, etc. Training of drivers was also started at a large number of RSETIs during the year.

• The first National evaluation of DAY-NRLM has been completed recently by the Institute of Rural Management Anand (IRMA). The draft report recognises the social capital developed through women's collectives at village level. The evaluation finds that the NRLM strategy has led to greater demand expression of rural poor not just through their weekly meetings but also through collective action in production as well as on social issues. Transforming lives through an even larger-scale diversification and development of livelihoods is clearly the way forward to reach the Mission Antyodaya objective of poverty-free gram panchayats.

# **Entire Country Gets National Food Security Act Coverage**

Kerala and Tamil Nadu have also rolled out the National Food Security Act (NFSA). With this, now the Act has been implemented in all the States and Union Territories. As a result, now 81.34 crore persons will get wheat at ₹2/kg and rice at ₹3/kg. Being an important initiative for ensuring food security of the people, the Government of India actively pursued with all the States/UTs for its early implementation.

Now the centre will focus on further reforms in PDS. which will include end to end computerization of the system for which States/UTs are being technically and financially assisted. This is important for bringing in transparency in the functioning of the public distribution system (PDS), which is vital feature of NFSA, in order to check leakages and diversion of food grains.

Highlighting other initiatives taken by the Centre to make the PDS leakage proof, the beneficiary's database has been digitized in all the 36 States/UTs, wherein, information is available right up to beneficiary level and is in the public domain. Online allocation of food grains is being done in 28 States/UTs, and the entire food grain supply chain has been computerized in 18 States/UTs. A 100% linkage of Ration Cards with Aadhaar, which is 71% at the moment, will be achieved. Food grain losses of FCI have been brought down to 0.04% and major FCI depots have been made online.

In another significant step towards better targeting and leakage-free distribution of food grains, direct benefit transfer is being carried out in two different modes. In the first mode, food subsidy is being transferred in cash into the bank account of beneficiaries, who then have the choice to buy food grains from the open market.

NITI Aayog launched 'Women Transforming India' campaign, in partnership with the UN in India and MyGov - #WomenTransform.

Celebrating women doers, leaders and change makers from across the country, NITI Aayog—Government of India's premier think tank—has launched the 'Women Transforming India' initiative on, March 8, 2016 International Women's Day, in partnership with the UN in India and MyGov.

As a policy think tank, NITI Aayog seeks to engage directly with women leaders from across urban and rural areas of India. 'Women Transforming India' is, therefore, our effort at putting our ear to the ground to gather successful stories of change heralded by women at the grassroots level, within communities.

Through the initiative, NITI Aayog is seeking for entries in the form of written essays/stories (not exceeding 500 words), preferably accompanied by photographs that set a context to the narrative. These stories should reflect new ground broken by women in empowering themselves/ others, or of challenging stereotypes.

Winning entries will receive a certificate of appreciation from NITI Aayog and the UN in India. Change makers may also have a chance to interact directly with policy makers in the Government of India to enable affect positive policy action.

We seek to encourage and recognize women who have made a difference, particularly, by demonstrating leadership in the economic, sociocultural and environmental front. Stories of change fostered through the setting up of small businesses/enterprises to generate livelihood opportunities for communities, challenging discriminatory practices/norms, or preserving the environment and responding to challenges of climate change are encouraged. Successes in leading change could have been achieved either through the use of technology or by employing innovating on-ground methods.
