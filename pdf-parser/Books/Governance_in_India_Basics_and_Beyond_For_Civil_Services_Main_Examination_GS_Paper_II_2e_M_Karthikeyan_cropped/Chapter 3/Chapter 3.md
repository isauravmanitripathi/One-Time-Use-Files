#### BASICS OF INDIAN PARLIAMENT

#### Introduction

"The people elect you to rulership, the wide glorious quarters elect you. Be seated on this high point in the body of the state and from there vigorously distribute the natural wealth and material prosperity to the people"

---Atharva Veda

The democratic governments across the world are majorly classified into parliamentary and presidential form, based on the nature of relation between the organs (i.e, the executives and the legislatives) of their government. In the parliamentary form of government, the executives take care of the legislature by framing the policies and acts and so can be held accountable by the legislature. Whereas, in the presidential form, the executive is not responsible to the legislature for its policies and acts, and thus independent of the legislature.

One of the most defining and distinguishing feature of parliamentary form of government is that the council of ministers are drawn from the legislature itself and the continuance of their office is contingent upon the support

of the legislature. Thus, they should enjoy majority support from the legislature, and they are collectively held responsible to the lower house of the Parliament, which is directly elected by the people.

In the Parliamentary system of India, the leader of majority party in the Lok Sabha – or the House of the People – is chosen to head the government, and he becomes the Prime minister. Rest of the council of ministers are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. and these ministers are members of either house of the Parliament, in case they are not, they have to become member of either house within 6 months from the date of appointment. The Prime Minister and his Council should enjoy the support of the Lower House, this house has the power to remove the government by passing a no-confidence motion against it. When such no-confidence motion is passed, it may lead to resignation of the government and paves way to the formation of a new government or fresh elections in case no party/coalition could form a stable government.

There is also a major difference in who heads the government and the state. In the parliamentary government, one heads the government and another person heads the state. On the other hand, both the government and the state are headed by the same person (the president) in the presidential government.

The parliamentary government is also called the Westminster model of government, cabinet government or responsible government and this form of government is being followed in Britain, India, Canada, Japan and many other countries. The parliamentary system originated in the British parliament which is located in Westminster and hence named 'Westminster model'. Parliamentary government is called a cabinet government because the cabinet (executive) is the main core of the parliamentary system. It is also known as 'responsible government', since the cabinet (executives) is held responsible by the legislature (parliament) and holds office as long as it enjoys the confidence of the latter.

The British system of government can be described as the 'prime ministerial government', because the power, influence and position of the prime minister have increased drastically off late. The same applies in the Indian context as well.

#### **Why India Chose Parliamentary Government?**

The Indian constitution provides for a parliamentary form of government both at the centre (Articles 74, 75) and in the states (Articles 163, 164). But while framing the Indian constitution, a dilemma whether to choose parliamentary or presidential system prevailed amongst the constituent assembly. Finally, the British parliamentary system was agreed upon by the founding fathers in consensus. The reasons were already dealt in the Chapter 'General Framework of Governance', it is explained in brief as follows:

- **1.** Since the parliamentary system has been in operation in India since the British rule, the constitution makers felt the familiarity with the system.
- **2.** A democratic executive must satisfy two conditions: stability and responsibility. The Draft constitution in recommending the parliamentary system of executive has preferred responsibility to stability, as stated by Dr B R Ambedkar. This point from Ambedkar, the father of Indian Constitution, shows the preference given to a responsible government which is provided by the parliamentary system.
- **3.** The constitution framers thought that a just-born democracy could not afford to take the risk of a feud or conflict between its organ of government (executive v. legislative), which is prone to happen in presidential system, prevalent in USA. So they looked upon a government which would act conducive and supportive to its organs and go hand in hand for the development of the country.
- **4.** The heterogeneity of Indian states proves to be one of the most complex plural societies in the world.

Keeping this in mind, the framers of our constitution chose parliamentary system, as it gives greater possibility for representation of various sections, interests and regions of the country. They also sighted that this might promote a national spirit among the people and build a united India.

#### **Features of Indian Parliament**

Parliament is the supreme legislative body of India. The Indian Parliament comprises of the President and the two Houses – Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and Lok Sabha (House of the People).

The Indian parliamentary government has the following features:

#### De Jure and De Facto Executives

In India, there are both nominal and real executives. The President is the nominal (*de jure*) executive and the prime minister is the real (*de facto*) executive. The prime minister is the head of the government, while the president is the head of the State. The president exercises his power with the aid and advice provided by the council of ministers headed by the prime minister.

#### Majority Party Rule

In the Lok Sabha elections, the party which secures majority seats will be asked to form the government. A prime minister is chosen amongst the party members and he/she is appointed by the president. The council of ministers is also appointed by the president but on the advice of the prime minister.

When no single party can prove majority in the elections, the president can invite a coalition of parties to form the government.

#### Collective Responsibility

Collective responsibility is considered as the core principle of parliamentary government. Article 75 of the constitution states that the ministers are responsible to the Parliament in general and to the Lok Sabha in particular. It means that the Lok Sabha can remove the council of ministers including the prime minister (collectively called ministry) from the office by passing a vote of no confidence.

#### Political Homogeneity

In general, the members of the council of ministers belong to the same political party, so it is expected from them to share the same political ideology. If in the case of coalition government, the ministers are bound by consensus.

#### Dual Membership

The ministers enjoy double membership, that is, they are the members of both the legislature and the executive, meaning, a person cannot be a minister without being a member of the Parliament.

The Constitution states that a minister loses his ministership if he/she does not become a member of the parliament within six months from his appointment.

#### Prime Minister – The Leader

The Prime minister is the leader of council of ministers, leader of the party in power and the leader of the parliament. He plays the leadership role in the parliamentary system of government. He plays a crucial role in the functioning of the government.

#### The Dissolution

The executives in parliamentary system enjoy the right to dissolve the legislature. Before the expiry of the term of Lok Sabha (the lower house), the prime minister can advise the president to dissolve the lower house and hold fresh elections. Simply put, the Lok Sabha can be dissolved by the president on recommendation of the prime minister.

#### Secrecy

The ministers are asked to take an oath of secrecy, administered by the President, before entering their office. They operate on the principle of secrecy and cannot disclose information about their proceedings, decisions and policies.

## **Powers and Functions of the Parliament**

Being the supreme legislative authority of India, the Parliament and the President hold several powers.

#### Office of the President

The President of India is a major component of Parliament, is elected, from a group of nominees, by the elected members of the Parliament of India (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) as well as of the state legislatures, and serves for a term of five years.

Historically, ruling party (majority in the Lok Sabha) nominees have been elected and run largely uncontested. A formula is used to allocate votes so there is a balance between the population of each state and the number of votes assembly members from a state can cast, and to give an equal balance between state Assembly members and national Parliament members.

If no candidate receives a majority of votes, there is a system by which losing candidates are eliminated from the contest and votes for them transferred to other candidates, until one gains a majority.

#### **a. Powers and Duties of the President**

- He summons and prorogues the sessions of both houses of the Parliament.
- He can even dissolve the Lok Sabha (under the recommendation of the Prime Minister).
- A bill passed by the Parliament can become a law only after the consent of the President.
- The President can use the power of **Pocket Veto** if he disagrees with a bill (the Indian Constitution does not specify a time limit for action to be taken by the President on a bill sent to him/her by the Parliament. Thus, by indefinitely postponing taking action on a bill, the president effectively vetoes it).
- However, if a President receives a bill he/she had previously vetoed and sent back to Parliament, where such a veto has been overruled by another Parliamentary vote, then such a bill becomes an act within fourteen days of the President's receiving it – regardless of his/her subsequent action/inaction.
- At the commencement of the first session after each general election of the Lok Sabha and at the commencement of the first session of each year, the president addresses both houses of the Parliament sitting together.
- He can nominate two members to the Lok Sabha from the Anglo-Indian community if he or she feels that the community is not adequately represented.
- He also nominates 12 members to the Rajya Sabha which consist of persons having special knowledge or practical experience in respect of such matters as the following, namely literature, science, sports, art and social service.
- Articles 111 and 368 deal about the legislative powers of the President.
- When a bill is passed by both the houses of the Parliament and is sent for the assent of the President, he can send back the bill for reconsideration to the Parliament unless it is a money bill or a constitutional amendment bill.
- In case of the returned bill, when the Parliament again passes such bill with or without amendments, and sent to the President again for reconsideration, he has to pass such bill and cannot refuse to give assent.
- Example of such an instance is when the Parliament Disqualification – Amendment Bill, 2006 as passed

by both the houses and was returned by the President for reconsideration, it was again passed by both the houses and thus the President had to give assent to the bill. But there is no time limit which has been specified within which the President has to give his assent in case of ordinary bills.

- Under Article 123, the President is empowered to promulgate ordinances when either of the houses is not in session. It has the same validity and power of a bill ordinarily passed by the Parliament.
- Such an ordinance ceases to operate if the Parliament does not approve it within 6 weeks of its date of sitting.

#### Lok Sabha (The Lower House)

Lok Sabha is also known as the 'House of the People' or the lower house. The Constitution provides that the maximum strength of the House be 552 members. The duration of the lower house, unless it is dissolved sooner, is for five years from the date of its first meeting and it cannot be extended in any case. As per Article 83, the Lok Sabha gets automatically dissolved at the end of five years.

The territorial constituencies from which the members are elected are fixed time to time by the Parliament subject to the condition that the number of such members is limited to 550 until the next census of 2026, as per Article 81.

All the members of the Lok Sabha (except two nominated members) are elected by citizens of India, anyone who is above 18 years of age, irrespective of gender, caste, religion or race, who is otherwise not disqualified to vote for the Lok Sabha.

To be eligible for membership in the Lok Sabha, a person must be a citizen of India and must be 25 years of age or older, mentally sound, should not be bankrupt and should not be criminally convicted. The total elective membership is distributed among the States in such a way that the ratio between the number of seats allotted to each State and the population of the State is, so far as practicable, the same for all states.

A total of 131 seats (18.42%) are reserved for representatives of Scheduled Castes (84) and Scheduled Tribes (47) only.

#### **a. Power and Duties of Lok Sabha**

Lok Sabha has certain powers that make it more powerful than the Rajya Sabha.

• In matters pertaining to non-financial (ordinary) bills, after the bill has been passed by the House where it was originally tabled (Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha), it is sent to the other house, where it may be kept for a maximum period of 6 months. If the other House rejects the bill or a period of 6 months elapses without any action by that House, or the House that originally tabled the bill does not accept the recommendations made by the members of the other house, it results in a deadlock. This is resolved by a joint session of both Houses, presided over by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and a decision is taken with a simple majority. The will of the Lok Sabha normally prevails in these matters, as its strength is more than double that of the Rajya Sabha.

- Money bills (a bill that involves government spending) can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, and upon being passed, are sent to the Rajya Sabha, where it can be deliberated on for up to 14 days. If not rejected by the Rajya Sabha, or 14 days lapse from the introduction of the bill in the Rajya Sabha without any action by the House, or recommendations made by the Rajya Sabha are not accepted by the Lok Sabha, the bill is considered passed. The budget is presented in the Lok Sabha by the Finance Minister in the name of the President of India.
- The Lok Sabha shares equal powers with the upper house – Rajya Sabha in the following issues:
  - ° In initiating and passing any bill for constitutional amendment (by a majority of the total membership of the House and at least two-third majority of the members present and voting).
  - ° In initiating and passing a motion for the impeachment of the President (by two-third of the membership of the House).
  - ° In the impeachment of the judges of the Supreme Court and the state High Courts (by a majority of the membership of the House and at least twothirds majority of the members present and voting).
  - ° Passing a resolution declaring war or national emergency (by two-third majority) or constitutional emergency (by simple majority) in a state.
- If the Lok Sabha is dissolved before or after the declaration of a National Emergency, the Rajya Sabha becomes the sole Parliament. It cannot be dissolved. This is a limitation on the Lok Sabha. But there is a possibility that president can exceed the term to not more than 1 year under the proclamation of emergency and the same would be lowered down to six-month if the said proclamation ceases to operate.
- Motion of no confidence against the government can be introduced and passed in the Lok Sabha. If passed by a majority vote, the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers resign collectively. The

Rajya Sabha has no power over such a motion, and hence no real power over the executive. However, the Prime Minister may threaten to dissolute the Lok Sabha and recommend this to the President, forcing an untimely general election. The President normally accepts this recommendation made by the Prime Minister, unless he is convinced otherwise that the Lok Sabha might recommend a new Prime Minister by casting a majority vote. Thus, both the executive and the legislature in India have checks and balances over each other.

#### Rajya Sabha (The Upper House)

The Rajya Sabha is also known as 'Council of States' or the Upper House. The first sitting of the Rajya Sabha was on 3rd April, 1952 with 216 members. Rajya Sabha is a permanent body and is not subject to dissolution. However, one third of the members retire every second year, and are replaced by newly elected members. Each member is elected for a term of six years. Its members are indirectly elected by members of legislative bodies of the states. Each member has a term of 6 years and elections are held for one-third of the seats after every 2 years. 238 members are to be elected from states and union territories and 12 are to be nominated by the President of India. The minimum age for a person to become a member of Rajya Sabha is 30 years. The fourth schedule governs the allocation of seats for the states and the union territories.

- Representatives of states are elected by the elected members of the Legislative Assembly of the state in accordance with system of proportional representation by means of single transferable vote.
- Representatives of union territories are indirectly elected by members of an electoral college for that territory in accordance with system of proportional representation. Except Delhi and Puducherry, no other Union territory has representation in the Rajya Sabha.
- As per Article 64, the Vice-President of India is the exofficio chairman of the Rajya Sabha. But he is not the member of the house, and in case any member of the house is elected as the Vice-President he has to vacate his seat in the house.

The Council of States is designed to maintain the federal character of the country.

#### **a. Special Powers of Rajya Sabha**

Apart from sharing equal powers with respect to ordinary bills, initiating and passing of Constitutional amendment bill and other matters, the Upper house has some exclusive powers. Mainly it was created as a check against arbitrary nature of the lower house. It was called as 'Wise-Chamber' where it was believed that the Upper House with its wisdom and experience guides the lower house. The special powers of Rajya Sabha are as follows:

- As per Article 249, the Rajya Sabha has the power to authorize Parliament to legislate in matters given in the state list in nature of public interest.
- Under Article 312, the Rajya Sabha has the power to create a new All-India Service which is common to both the Centre and the States.

#### **b. The Need for the Second Chamber**

The system of Bicameral legislature was first set up in India in 1921 under the Government of India Act, 1919. The Government of India Act, 1935 retained the bicameral system. The need for having a second chamber was deliberated elaborately in the constituent assembly. And the overwhelming view of the members of the chamber was to retain in the bicameral system. The following are some of the key points of debate that took place in the constituent assembly:

- The Upper House was considered to be a house of deep reflection and revision which was to be unswayed by the election politics.
- Being a federal chamber and permanent house, that is, not being subject to dissolution, the council of state can effectively counter the direct representative of peoples in the lower house.
- Member of Constituent Assembly, Nazim Uddin Ahmad, stated that the second chamber 'introduces an element of sobriety and second thought'. The Parliament of a sovereign nation has to deal with foreign and domestic matters of extreme importance which justifies the need for a second chamber.
- To quote Nazim Uddin Ahmad, '*In these circumstances it will be wise for us to have two houses. A popular House is known for its vitality and vigour and that House will have the exclusive power in regard to money. But a second chamber introduces an element of sobriety and second thought, it would be wise for us, especially in view of many foreign subjects which are looming large in our minds, to have a second chamber'*.
- Other members of the Constituent Assembly were of the view that the second chamber would be a reflective and revising chamber.
- Speaking in the Constituent Assembly, Gopalaswami Ayyangar, the then member of the drafting committee, stated that the second chamber would '*hold dignified debates on important issues and delay legislations which might be the outcome of the*

*passions of the moment and checkmate the hasty legislation'*.

- The second chamber was considered to represent the federal character of the country.
- Another member of the assembly, Lokanath Misra, wanted the Council of States to be like that of the Senate in USA with equal representation of all states in it.
- Ananthasayanam Ayyangar contended that the second chamber would provide opportunity to people who are interested in politics but unwilling to join in the election process.
- Ultimately it was agreed that the Upper house would be the representative and protector of the interests of the State. With such provision, it would be impossible to represent the interest of the states in the Union legislature.

#### **Role of Indian Parliament**

Some of the major roles performed by the parliament are as follows:

#### Legislative Role

The Parliament makes laws on all subjects listed in the Union List. It can also make laws on subjects listed under the Concurrent List. In case there is any conflict or overlapping in the provisions existing in the Union and State enactment, the Union law prevails. In cases when an emergency has been declared, the Union Parliament can also make laws on subjects that fall within the State List. Thus, the legislative power of the Parliament is very wide and far-reaching, they are only curtailed by the Judiciary in case such legislations goes beyond the provisions of the Constitution.

#### Financial Role

The Parliament has been given exclusive powers to provide procedures through which revenue can be raised for the public services. And to achieve that, it imposes taxes and ensures that the money sanctioned for expenditure to various departments of the government has been used for the authorized purposes only. The Budget for the entire country is presented and passed by the Parliament, it includes almost all the important offices of public importance. And in every such budget there is increase or introduction of new taxes which affect the people.

The Parliament also takes decision of allocation of funds, grant-in-aid to the states based on the reports of the Finance Commission, and erstwhile Planning Commission. Thus, the Parliament through the committees like Public Accounts Committee, Committee on Public Undertakings, etc. scrutinizes the report submitted by the Comptroller and Auditor General to keep a check on the executive action. Hence, in the sphere of finance, the Parliament has a very important role to play.

#### Providing and Exercising Control Over Cabinet

Our Parliamentary system blends the legislative and the executive organs of the State in as much as the executive power is wielded by a group of Members of the Legislature who command majority in the Lok Sabha.

To be more specific, the government functions through various ministries under the charge of different ministries. The Parliament provides the ministers and holds them responsible to the elected representatives of the people. The Ministers could be a member of either of the two Houses of the Parliament. The actual execution of government policies as decided by the Parliament is carried out by the bureaucracy headed by a Secretary of the Department.

The Lok Sabha can also pass number of motions censuring the actions of the executives. The ultimate weapon in the hands of the Parliament is the no-confidence motion, which if passed will lead to the resignation of the government.

#### Assessment of the Work of the Cabinet

The Parliament provides the forum through which it ensures that the Cabinet remains in power only as long as it commands majority support in the Lok Sabha which comprises elected representatives of the people. It is one of the most important functions of the Parliament to bring about discussions and critical assessments of the performance of the government departments.

The debates ensure that the weaknesses in terms of performance are brought to light and the ministers and through them the entire executive machinery is kept on toes. There are also number of committees set up by the Parliament to keep check on the executive action, some of the committees are Estimates committee, Committee on Privileges, Ethics Committee, Committee on Subordinate Legislation, Business Advisory Committee, Rules Committee, General Purpose Committee etc.

#### Wide Representation

The parliament provides representation to all sections and regions in the country ensuring that the nation gets to know about various alternative points of view. Such representation ensures that the diversity of the nation is represented and the issues of all section of the society are effectively addressed in the Parliament.

#### An Organ of Information

Parliament is the most powerful organ so far as the information about the functioning of the government is concerned. The information provided in the Houses is authoritative and ministers are bound to provide information on matters of government when so desired by the members. Such information is made public through the media or under the Right to Information Act. Sharing of information is vital in a democracy as it will ensure transparency and will lead to the establishment of good governance, which will ultimately benefit the people.

#### Constitutional Role

The power to amend the Constitution vests with the Parliament. Constitutional amendments can be initiated by either of the house and have to be passed by each house by a majority of total membership as well as by two-third majority of members present in voting. In some cases amendments need ratification from half of the Legislative assemblies of the States. There are three types of bills for constitutional amendment which requires:

- **a.** Simple majority: majority of members present and voting.
- **b.** Special majority: two thirds of the members of the present and voting in each of the house.
- **c.** Special majority with consent from half of all the state legislatures: Needs special majority in both the houses along with at least half of the state legislatures giving the consent for the bill.

Such an amending power of the Parliament is not ultimate and absolute. In the following matters, it requires the ratification of legislatures of half of the States.

- Election of the President
- Extent of the executive power of the Union
- Extent of executive power of the states
- Powers relating to Supreme Court and High courts
- Distribution of legislative powers
- Representation of the states in the parliament
- Provision relating to Article 368

Apart from these, the Parliament cannot amend the 'Basic Structure' of the Parliament. Based on the judgment of Supreme Court in *Kesavananda Bharati* case, it was held that the 'Basic Structure' of the constitution cannot be altered. Later when the legislature tried to override this judgment by enacting the 42nd Amendment, the Supreme Court came down again and declared such provision to be unconstitutional in the *Minerva Mills* case. The Supreme Court stated that the power of judicial review was one of the basic features and it cannot be taken away.

#### Judicial Role

Parliament has the exclusive powers to impeach the President and remove judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts through a prescribed procedure. Parliament can also punish a person for contempt or defamation of the House. It can also punish its members or outsiders for the breach of privilege or its contempt. Thus, it plays a quasijudicial role in such occasions and such powers have been conferred by the Constitution itself.

#### Elective Role

Elected members of the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha constitute the electoral college for the election of the Vice-President. Along with elected members of the State Legislatures, they form the electoral college for election to the office of the President. Therefore, they have also such elective role to play apart from their other important roles. Election of President is of paramount importance, though not directly elected by the people, he is elected through their representatives. It thus places greater responsibility in part of the Parliamentarians to choose such person whom the people would choose. Parliament thus plays an important role in the electoral process.

#### Role in Creation of States

The Parliament can also by legislation create new states or make changes in the existing boundaries and alter the name of the states. Our Constitution though a federal entity, leans more towards the Centre. The federal system is considered to be 'destructible States of indestructible Union'. Thus, the boundaries, names, territorial extent etc. of a state can always be changed, and such a power is in the hands of the Parliament and not the states themselves. Even if the states are not interested or against such move, they have no power under the Constitution to challenge it. Thus, the Parliament has been bestowed with the ultimate power to create or alter boundaries of the States.

#### Role Played by the Parliament to Address the Grievances of the Public

The meaning of the term Parliament implies that it is a place of discussion of public affairs. The issues which are raised receive due consideration, and the government has to respond to such issues. There are number of devices available to the member to raise question, start discussion, seek information, and put forth the needs and aspirations of the people. The following are some of the devices used:

- Questions
- Motions
- Resolutions
- Short duration discussion
- Calling attention motion
- Special mention
- Discussion on Motion of thanks to the President which is addressed to both houses assembled together
- Motion of no-confidence and confidence in the Council of Ministers
- Discussions on bills
- Zero hour
- Half-hour discussion

All these enable the members to effectively redress the grievances of the people. There are also number of committees such as the Committee on Public Petitions, Finance committees, Welfare of OBCs, Empowerment of Women, Welfare of SCs and STs, on Subordinate legislation, and various Department-related Standing Committees etc.

Thus, all these devices help to highlight the needs of the public before the government. The government cannot ignore issues raised through such fora, because it will be adverse to public interest. Thus, parliament plays an important role to redress the grievances of the public.

#### Other Roles

- Discussion of various issues of national and international importance
- Imposing emergency
- Creation or abolition of state legislature, etc.

The Parliament is considered to the nerve-centre of the democratic politics in India. The Council of Ministers is drawn from the Parliament and they are collectively responsible to the Lower House – Lok Sabha. The Parliament has the sole power to amend the Constitution and legislate. Parliament articulates the needs, aspiration, pain, and the suffering of the people. The accountability of the executive is secured by the Parliament. They question the administrative actions and the wrong-doings. The Council of Ministers who are members of both the Executive and the Legislature, is considered to be 'a hyphen which joins a buckle which fastens the legislative part of the state with the executive part'. This organic connection between the executive and the legislature can also be described in the words of Woodrow Wilson (28th U.S. President), 'the ministers to lead the Houses – without dictating to them and, the ministers themselves be controlled without being misunderstood'. Hence, there exists close coordination between the executive and the legislature which is seen absent in the Presidential form of government.

#### **Decline of Indian Parliament**

India holds the unique distinction of being the largest democracy in the world. For the past 70 years it has shown its resilience and has stood strong against clandestine forces that have challenged its integrity. However, it has to be agreed that our parliamentary system is not immune to challenges and limitations. Though it has provided one of the finest constitutions and legislative systems in the modern era, experts feel that the Indian parliamentary setup is undergoing a steady decline in terms of its accountability and efficacy as the highest law making body in the country.

- Our founding fathers envisioned to create a democratic system in which the legislature, executive and the judiciary will have their own domains of operation.
- While they would have significant autonomy with their respective functions, a system of checks and balances, where one will be responsible to another, would ensure the credible functioning of each institution in this setup – the legislature would create laws, which will be implemented by the executive, which will in turn be interpreted and enforced by the judiciary.
- In the meanwhile, the executive will be responsible to the legislature and the latter will have to be accountable to the judiciary regarding the constitutionality of the laws made.
- While the system provided for an ideal mechanism for a representative democracy, over the years the three organs have taken turns to ruffle feathers against each other, trying to manifest their importance or to restrict the others' sphere of influence.

On numerous occasions, the judiciary has had strained relationships with both the executive and the legislature. The judiciary has stepped many a times beyond its domain to direct the executive in the name of judicial activism. Passing orders to use CNG (M.C. Mehta v. Union of India, (1991)2 SCC 137) and cleaning of rivers (M.C. Mehta v. Union of India) are a few examples.

The executive on the other hand, doesn't do any less in pushing its powers on the other two organs. The executive has tried to pass laws against the rulings of the judiciary in order to provide relief on a stop-gap basis. Also, while lawmaking is a collective responsibility of the legislature, the past few decades have hardly seen a private member's bill being passed by the parliament or state legislatures. Moreover, the executive has made excessive use of the ordinance route to pass those laws that serve the government's interests and which are likely to be shot down by the legislature.

There are four vital responsibilities of the parliament,

#### Representation of Citizens, Law Making, Oversight of the Executive and Scrutiny of the Budget.

The following briefly outlines the backseat that Parliament has taken over the years, some examples being the declining number of working days and the bills passed. If numbers are an indication of the performance of an institution then on the face of it, the Parliament has fallen short in discharging its constitutional obligation and reveals a steady decline in its functioning. The following shows how parliamentary functioning is declining over time.

- **1. Loss of Productive Time:** Over the past few decades, the Lok Sabha has consistently lost a significant portion of its productive time to disruptions and petty political clashes – the 15th Lok Sabha has been marked as the most disrupted in the history of the Indian Parliament. Such hindrances slow down the law-making process and curb the effective performance of the legislature. The 15th Lok Sabha, passed only 179 out of the total 291 bills introduced. This is the lowest on record by a legislature that lasted a full five-year term.
- **2. More Ordinances:** The decline in parliamentary functioning has led to the government resorting to the ordinance route as an alternative. The weightage of ordinance as against conventional law creation has increased.

In the famous D.C. Wadhwa v. State of Bihar (AIR 1987 SC 579), the unbridled use of ordinance by the Government of Bihar was challenged in the Supreme Court. The court observed that the excessive use of ordinance outside the domain of conventional lawmaking is a usurpation of the legislative process and thus a fraud on the Constitution. Nonetheless, governments still make use of ordinances to get laws into place.

- **3. Member Bill:** Private member bills are essential to ensure fail-proof governance. This is because such bills are likely to be drafted considering the gaps and loopholes in law and policy. Moreover, these members are free from the influence of the government or the cabinet. Despite their potential to serve as effective instruments to regulate and refine government policies, they have been hardly given importance in our parliamentary system. Since 1952, only 14 private member bills have been passed till date. Though they get introduced before the Parliament, they are hardly given the importance that is given to a government bill.
- **4. Debates on Budget:** Having an oversight on the government's expenditure is yet another important task of the Parliament. Considering the number of hours being spent on discussing the budget in the recent past, it can be believed that even this function of the Parliament is on a decline. Conventionally, discussions on the Demand for Grants are made in the house following the examination of such demands by parliamentary standing committees. In the past 10 years or so, nearly 95% of the demands are being passed without proper discussion in the house.
- **5. Fraud on Exchequer:** The daily expenditure incurred by the parliamentary process is quite a burden on the public exchequer, considering the inconsistencies

mentioned above. The salaries, office allowances etc., of members of parliament, amount to several crores every year. This is in addition to other perks that they get in kind. As much as it is expected of the government to be accountable, the highest law-making body should as well be equally accountable. The only way to ensure this is by bringing in reforms.

**6. Disruptions in the Parliament:** The Speaker described the constant disruptions of the Lok Sabha by the opposition members as 'Murder of Democracy'. Various incidents such as cash for votes, snatching away the papers when they were presented, hurling of torn papers at the chair, cash for query, displaying placards despite their prohibition, shouting of slogans, ambling the well of the house, defiance of rules, violation of rules of debate, and showing utter defiance to the chair have tarnished the image of the Parliaments before the public. And the most important aspect is that there remains an utter disconnect between the public needs and requirements and the debates and issues dealt with by the Parliament.

Thus, there has been a steady decline in performance of the Parliament. The following can be assessed as the **reasons for decline of Parliament:**

- **1.** The authority which was initially rested on the Parliament has now been taken over by the Cabinet. The Cabinet now has been ultimate decider of important aspects such as summoning of the house, proroguing of the session, preparation of daily time table for the session, providing the inaugural speech to be delivered by the head of the state, and doing numerous other things which fall under the purview of the Parliament.
- **2.** The role played by the members of the parliament has not been up to the level expected of them. The quality, competence, culture and commitment have significantly declined. Large number of MPs show very little interest in attending the Parliament. The attendance records show a dismal picture of nature of absenteeism of our members.
- **3.** The quality of debates in the Parliament has gone down. In the previous era, the debates in the Parliament were characterized by wit, humour and wisdom but today they have been reduced to character assassination, insults and abuses.
- **4.** In the Westminster system of government, the Prime Minister is the leader of the house. Such a person should command respect and should be dignified in his/her approach in the Parliament.
- **5.** The virtual monopoly of a single political party for nearly 50 years after independence has made the

legislature a rubber stamp authority. This is because all the bills, policies, acts are not effectively debated in the Parliament. The data shows that the Parliament spends very little time in sifting through the acts, bills, amendments which are to be passed. Hence, there is little accountability and the effective check to be kept by the Parliament is absent, here there is thus the dictatorship and dominance by the Cabinet. In the 2008, 14 important bills were passed in a single day, and numerous such voluminous legislations are passed without effective notice or debate, this shows the way in which the accountability of the parliament is bypassed by the government.

- **6.** Even in finance bills the situation was the same. Crores of amount is granted when the Appropriation Bill is placed before the Parliament without any debate. In the 2004–2005 the Railway Budget was passed without any debate and discussion, and the same happened for the general budget also, which was passed without discussion.
- **7.** There has been a steady decline in the number and duration of the sitting of Parliament after the first Lok Sabha. This decline is not only seen in number of hours or sittings, it is also seen in quality and length of debates and its outcomes. The highest recorded sittings were during the first Lok Sabha (1952–1957) which was for 3784 hours (677 sittings). In the year 2011 the Parliament totally sat for a meagre 73 days and 2008 was the worst recorded as the Houses sat for just 46 days. The Parliamentary affairs minister was quoted saying that each disruption to the Parliament cost the exchequer 2.5 lakh a minute.

Commenting on the second session of the 14th Lok Sabha, *The Hindu* observed that,

*'Parliamentary misconduct has become so routine that it might appear a waste of effort even to discuss the whys and wherefores of it. Forget the daily adjournments and walkouts; in recent times disrupters have spared no occasion, not even the once sacrosanct presidential address. However, when confrontation reaches a point where the very existence of Parliament was questioned, then it is distress time as much for the democracy as for the institution itself'.*

Thus, there is seen a steady decline in nature and functioning of the Parliament. And this has resulted in monetary loss as well as social loss to the people. They have not only lost valuable time, but they have lost the train of development.

#### **Suggestions for Improvement**

Since the first day of independence, these pulpits of governance have served the purpose of being a forum for the vast population spread across a multiplicity of ethnic and linguistic diversities. But as discussed prior to this section, parliamentary culture in India has indeed taken a beating. What makes it worse is that without investing much effort on assessing the reasons for decline, the stakeholders concerned treat the situation with overt cynicism.

Over the past seven decades, the structure and functions of Parliament have grown on the principles of democratic socialism, economic democracy and distributive justice. Of late, due to the information explosion, technological revolution and challenges in administration brought about by LPG (Liberalization, Privatization and Globalization) reforms, along with the age-old principle of Welfare State, etc., have conferred upon the Parliament a larger spectrum of responsibilities. All of the above coupled with the inadequacy of time; limitations in terms of access to information and the sub-standard conduct of parliamentary proceedings have resulted in the creation of mediocre legislation and unsatisfactory parliamentary oversight on administration.

Minimal effort has been taken to develop the essential ingredients to achieve success in parliamentary polity. These include discipline, character, and a sense of public morality, ideologically oriented two-party system and willingness to listen to and to accommodate minority views.

Whenever the government of the day enjoyed a lean majority (that too with the aid of a coalition) and the opposition had little numbers to emerge as an alternative, the Parliament has performed less effectively. Examples of this situation were many a time visible during the 1989– 1999 decade. The floor of the house hardly witnessed a constructive legislative process. There was little respect among the members and ministers to the institution, which could be understood by the alarming trends of absenteeism and defection.

- Parliamentary reforms have a decisive role in ensuring sustainable and equitable growth, especially in an era fueled by liberalization and globalization.
- Archaic processes have to be revised, control mechanisms on members should be strengthened, debating and decision-making procedures should be made efficient etc.
- For the Parliament, constant review and revamp should be done to prevent it from becoming obsolete.

- As much as efforts are being taken to do this, it shouldn't be restricted to mere administration of stopgap measures.
- A full-scale review is essential to provide institutional, structural, procedural and organizational improvement.

What is needed is a full-scale review. We have to be prepared for fundamental institutional – structural, functional, procedural and organizational – changes. The overriding guiding norm and purpose of all parliamentary reforms should be to make both Government and Parliament more relevant to meet the challenges of the times and the changing national needs in the context of the objective of faster economic growth.

Both the Parliament and the Government should be collectively concerned with concurrent and contemporaneous monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of economic reforms, scrutiny of the overall performance of the economy, targets, achievements, shortfalls etc. The following are the reform measures which are needed to be carried out.

- **1. Reforms in Budget Process:** Some serious thinking is called for in the matter of reforming the budget procedure in Parliament and bringing it closer to the needs and constraints of the new situation. The number of occasions on which voting by divisions may be needed during a budget session is very large. Also, the defeat of any demand for grant is deemed to be tantamount to expression of lack of confidence in the Government. There is every possibility of a division being asked for more often only to embarrass the Government. It would be unrealistic to expect all the Members to be present all the time through the session. It would, therefore, be wise to reduce to the barest minimum the number of days on which voting by division is considered imminent. Also, the time may be fixed by agreement and announced in advance with appropriate whips issued and attendance ensured otherwise.
- **2. Nodal Standing Committee on Economy:** A Nodal Standing Committee on National Economy with subject-oriented study groups, assisted by scholars and experts, should be constituted to monitor economic policy formulation and implementation. The respective study groups would make performance evaluation on these areas and prepare internal study reports which will be produced to the Committee. These will be presented annually by the Committee to the Parliament. Besides being informative on policy measures of the government, it helps in keeping a constant

vigilance and performing reviews on the system as a whole. The insights presented by the committee could be discussed effectively by the houses of Parliament every year.

**3. Better Communication to Improve Public Perception:** The Parliament serves as a link between the citizens and the government. But there is a perceived disconnect between the people and the parliament, whenever they discuss its proceedings. They are led to believe that there is hardly any contribution from them in the decision-making process. This was caused due to the ineffective management of public relations in the past. And it has resulted in a poor perception of the Parliament and its members.

Systematic and conscious efforts are required to rebuild a good rapport between the people and the parliament. For this purpose, the potential of mass media, print publications, online media etc., should be harnessed to get the message across the board. The news channels such as DD News, RSTV and LSTV have to be exploited to the maximum in communicating about the parliamentary proceedings via electronic media. Live coverage of debates and sessions in the parliament will help in building a sense of credibility among the public.

- **4. Panchayats and Parliament:** In an era where there are calls from different quarters to decentralize governance, the roles of an MP as against a local body member have to be clearly demarcated. Immense care has to be taken to avoid any conflict or overarching of powers among them. The scope of work for an MP, with respect to his/her constituency has to be restricted to issues of national importance. For effective implementation of those schemes which require the coordination of the two, as in the case of Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS), proper brainstorming and planning has to be done to avoid any implementation blunders.
- **5. Improving the Quality of Participation of Members:** Proper functioning of Parliament is dependent on the quality of participation of members. From good conduct, insightful questioning to sincere participation in constructive debates, every member should act beyond what his/her party requires. It should begin with proper training and orientation of newly elected members about the conventions, traditions, rules and regulations that determine parliamentary conduct. The curriculum should include things such as adequate knowledge of the constitution, the parliamentary system, the Rules of Procedure and

Conduct of Business, etc. Insufficient training and orientation in the past has adversely affected the performance of the members and the parliament at large.

- **6. Reducing the Expenditure of the Parliament:** The costs involved in maintaining the parliamentary system in our country have always been increasing. One of the most commonly discussed aspects of parliamentary expenditure is the spending on salaries and emoluments of its members. The charges under this heading alone go up to several lakhs a year. This along with the ministerial salaries and that of the members of state legislatures put together would run into crores annually. Prudent fixing of salaries and emoluments is the immediate need of the hour. Moreover, this is one of the expenditures that are not discussed in the budget. Therefore, it is a moral responsibility of the legislators to take salaries that are not disproportionate to the work they do.
- **7. Improving Information Supply:** Any conversation becomes irrelevant if there is not a valuable sharing of information. Information is one of the essential instruments to have an effective functioning of a participatory democracy. Without this, it would be difficult to have a hold over the arbitrary nature of governance by the party in power. Unfortunately, most of the time, our members rely on official documents and data that have only been published by the respective ministries. More often than not, this information is likely to be inadequate. To address this situation, an independent national information repository, exclusively for the purpose of providing information to members of the parliament, should be created.
- **8. Planning Legislation and Improving its Quality:** The quality of our legislative products have been often turned down as haphazard. This is primarily due to the non-compliance in spirit to the process of law making adopted by our constitution makers. There is a need for a dynamic and comprehensive approach to law making

This can be done by:

- **(i)** Streamlining the functions of the Parliamentary and Legal Affairs Committee of the Cabinet.
- **(ii)** Widening the roles of the Law Commission.
- **(iii)** Setting up a Legislation Committee to supervise and coordinate legislative planning.
- **(iv)** Referring all bills to the newly set-up Departmental Standing Committees for consideration and scrutiny, consulting concerned interest groups and finalization of the second reading stage in

the relaxed atmosphere of Committees aided by experts thereby reducing the burden of the House without impinging on any of its rights and improving the quality of drafting and content of legislation.

- **9. Setting up a Constitution Committee for Amendments:** The executive powers of the Union are collinear with its legislative powers. However, the constituent power should belong to the Parliament. This means that while the government can initiate and orient the legislature to make laws that suit its policies, the parliament has a bigger responsibility in terms of bills that amend the constitution.
  - At present, constitutional amendment bills are introduced just like any other ordinary bill in the Parliament.
  - While this encroaches on the time of the parliament for passing ordinary bills, it also gives very little time for discussing the need for and the pros and cons of the respective amendment bills.
  - Instead of clubbing it with regular business, if it can be put through a scrutiny by a specific committee on constitutional amendments or a body authorized by the Parliament, it would go a long way in ensuring a better standard of amendments.

The scrutiny should go deep into the cause and relevance of the proposed amendments and critically examine each and every provision, in order to produce an outcome, much better than what can be done through the conventional process of law making. This committee could include members of both houses of the parliament and judicial officers/legal experts such as the attorney general or solicitor general to provide insights and inferences about the bills. While it will make the amendment process much more robust, it will also reduce the possibility of the amendment being turned down by the judiciary as unconstitutional.

**10. Departmental Committees and Parliamentary streamlining:** The setting up of the 27 departmental standing committees has been a remarkable parliamentary reform in the past decades. However, what began as three committees in 1989 on an experimental basis has been increasing ever since, at a progressive pace. Having specific departmental standing committees does help in faster completion of business. However, the overall costs in running such a huge framework of committees necessitate a larger bill of expenditures.

Parliamentary supervision of administration through committees is supposed to enable good governance and not act as a barrier at all times. For proper conduct of standing committees, the following measures can be adopted:

- **(i)** Proper closing of pre-budget scrutiny of budgetary estimates and demands for grants before they are voted in the House.
- **(ii)** Concurrent and contemporaneous examination of the activities of Government departments and matters of national concern in cool, nonpartisan atmosphere.
- **(iii)** Monitoring of performance, relating to financial inputs to the policy objectives and actual outcomes to measure effectiveness and detailed examination of supplementary estimates.
- **(iv)** Feedback with valuable insights and information to the Parliament and to the Government to review economic proposals.
- **(v)** Closer and competent inspection of all legislative proposals.
- **(vi)** Review of the implementation of different laws passed by the Parliament across the respective subjects.
- **(vii)** Encouraging participation by backbenchers and creating a second level of leadership.
- **(viii)** Development of skill specialization and expertise in legislative processes among members.

The committees could, strengthen the government by providing valuable insights for the better functioning of the government and the parliament. With a spirit of cutting-edge professionalism, thee committees could play a major role in accelerating the Parliament towards becoming a forum for meaningful body for multilateral dialogue.

- **11. C**o**ntrol over Borrowing:** While the budgetary proposals and estimates are reviewed by the several committees in the Parliament, there is no specific committee to oversee the function of public borrowing. A limit on public borrowing will instil a sense of responsibility and an idea and it leaves behind a smaller burden for the upcoming generations.
- **12. Discussing Committee Reports on the Floor of the House:** When a committee's report is not read on the floor of the house, it belittles the importance attached to the particular committee. This could result in some very useful recommendations going unnoticed or insufficiently discussed.
- **13. Codifying Parliamentary Privileges:** While members of the parliament are justified in receiving certain privileges in view of exercising their duties, limitless powers or concessions should not be given to them.

#### 62 **Governance in India**

These privileges are given to the parliament by the people and hence should not be misused. A joint committee may be created to rationalize the extent of privileges offered and recommend appropriate regulations.

- **14. Reforming the Functions of Parliamentary Parties:** The parties that have their members as members of the parliament should have the responsibility to train them accordingly. Relevant briefing on the position of the party on specific issues, speech notes and write-ups etc. have to be given prior with proper training in order to avoid any miscommunication on the floor of the house. Free voting on issues shall be called for in case of most discussions on the floor of the house. This will create an environment in the house, free from the influence of parties. Such a measure would also change the way confidence on a government is tested. Only when a government is defeated through a no-confidence motion shall it be asked to resign.
- **15. Reforms in Quality of Debates and Discussions:** One of the areas where such a restraint should come in is with time management for discussions and debates. It comes as no surprise that sessions throughout the year have little significant business done, due to unnecessary discussions and resentment towards the party in power by the opposition and vice versa.
  - What begin as rational debates are more likely to end up as adjourned sittings, since political parties try to use the floor to show their wrath against each other instead of using the floors as constructive forums for policy management.
  - This situation can be addressed by having such discussions at the committee level.
  - Besides having enough time for such discussions, it also leaves the floor of the house for debating issues of national importance.
  - Members should be sensitized on the proper use of parliamentary devices such as *Question hour* and *Zero hour*.

Several other items of business such as Adjournment Motions, Calling the Attention Notices, No-Confidence motions, etc. initiated by Private Members have to be taken up at a dedicated time on a weekly basis. Moreover, parliamentary business can be shared between the committees and the houses equitably, in such a way that neither organ is denied necessary time allotment.

**16. Reform in Expression of Opinion of the Members:** Freedom of expression should be given to every Member of Parliament without compromise. It is one of the basic principles in representative democracy. It is accepted that unparliamentary or objectionable words spoken should be removed from the record of the house's proceedings on the speaker's advice. However, this should not be misused by the speaker to hold an unsolicited control on the opposition members. The same is applicable to television broadcasts of the sessions. As much as possible, proceedings should be telecasted without deleting or muting portions of the sittings.

- **17. Reforms in Question Hour:** Both houses of the Parliament demarcate an hour each during every day of the session for questions. Essentially, this should be a time where the government is questioned about its policy or a decision or some matter with significant importance. However, this has become a time where discussions are made and hardly five questions are covered in a time where around twenty questions are to be taken up for answering. A proper scrutiny of the list of questions will reveal that a lot of the admitted questions are trivial or ambiguous in nature. At times, some questions of top priority cause a serious dislocation of the proper functioning of ministries in the government. Such practices and processes of raising and admitting such questions must be reviewed and streamlined for effective conduct of business in the Parliament.
- **18. Reforms in other Motions:** Adjournment motions too are not immune from being ineffectively used. The purpose of this motion is to call the attention of the House for immediate discussion on a matter of urgent public importance, which has not been already included in the List of Business for the day. However, the discretion of admitting such a discussion lies with the speaker. When admission is refused, members keep storming the well and what follows is a tug-ofwar between them and the speaker. The solution to this lies in the speaker expressing his/her genuine opinion on the urgent **importance of the issue and maintaining order in the house.**
- **19. Other Procedural Reforms:** Either house of the Parliament has its own set of rules and procedures. All those rules except the ones which have been codified in the Rules of Procedure should be regularly reviewed and they should be removed if they are found to be obsolete. Conventions and procedures should be adapted according to the demands of time and should never be a hindrance to the proper functioning of the Parliament.
- **20. Tackling Absenteeism:** Yet another problem faced by parliamentary conduct is the increasing incidences

of absenteeism among members. It is no less than a threat to democracy. A quorum of at least one-tenth is required for conduct of business in the Parliament. But this cannot be allowed to become a standard minimum attendance requirement for having sessions. As members who represent the people, they should have a moral inclination to attend parliamentary sessions except in cases when they have to attend other duties of high priority. Therefore, a minimum number of hours to be attended by a member can be added to the rules and procedure, in such a way that the member would contribute significantly. Those not complying can be given a deduction in their salaries throughout the session.

- **21. Reform in Parliamentary Secretariat:** The success of the parliamentary system lies in the independent and impartial functioning of the parliamentary secretariat. The secretariat should be supplied with the best of the resources available. Besides, they should also be constituted with mechanisms to correspond freely with the ministerial secretariats.
- **22. Decriminalization of Politics:** The judgment given by the Apex court in the Lily Thomas case will go a long way in decriminalizing the election process, where only an individual without criminal background is fielded by the political parties. The media and the civil society have to distinguish between serious penal offences, financial irregularities and acts of violation of prohibitory orders. These different charges may not be equated with one another.
- **23. Linkage between the People and Parliament:** The Parliament is the communication link between the government and public. There is a necessity to establish a good rapport between the two entities. The public and the government have to be brought together. The Parliament belongs to the people and not its members. The members are thus responsible to the public at large. The members should have access to the opinion of the public and the public should also have the access of the Parliament.
- **24. Regular Orientation Programmes:** Improving the quality of the members is one of the most important aspect of the reform process. It is the bound duty of every member to uphold the dignity and decorum of the institution both inside and outside of it. The image of the Parliament will be poor unless the quality of its members is improved. A newly elected member is often lost in the number of traditions, conventions, rules, regulations, formalities etc. of the parliamentary system. Hence, there is need to institutionalize the process of training for the newly

elected members. The curriculum of such training should cover all aspects including, the Constitution, the knowledge about the political system, the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business, various other practices, traditions, precedents, do's and don'ts of members, and rules of Parliamentary etiquettes etc. There should also be periodic training imparted to the members on various issues so that the quality of the institution never falls.

#### **Conclusion**

The endurance of democracy and freedom in India are completely dependent on the successful functioning of the Parliament. Though we can take pride in the relentless working of this body for the past 70 years, we have to accept that the issues mentioned above are slowly eroding its stand as an institution of legitimacy and a watchtower of democracy. But it is also true that no reform can happen in a single blow. And no single reform can bring about a miracle change. The way ahead should be taken with utmost care and caution by setting up a parliamentary reforms commission, on the lines of a commission instituted in the United Kingdom for a similar purpose. The recommendations of this commission should be presented to the Rules Committee of the parliament, which will present it to the house and suitable reforms can be incorporated. Such periodical initiatives done with a sincere effort will increase the credibility of the Parliament and fortify its character as the watch tower of Indian democracy.

# **Issues of Recent Concern in Parliamentary Functions**

#### **Comptroller and Auditor General- Bloodhound or Watchdog?**

Governance, in modern times, is synonymous with the concepts of public welfare and equitable growth. The basic responsibility of the Governments today is to ensure all round improvement in standard of living of the public at large, besides performing the traditional duty of providing security to its citizens. The Government therefore formulates policies and programmes which aim at achieving high rate of growth while ensuring proper distribution of benefits, both socially and regionally. The approach of the Government thus, has to be participatory, consensus oriented, accountable, transparent, equitable and inclusive.

Public Governance is based on the division of powers and responsibilities. Traditionally, such a division distinguishes between the executive, the legislature and the

#### 64 **Governance in India**

judiciary. Public Financial Management is the responsibility of the executive and oversight of this function is the responsibility of either the legislature or the judiciary or as in case of India by an independent constitutional authority, independent of both the legislature and the executive.

Comptroller and Auditor General of India, entrusted with the crucial responsibility to ensure that the public funds are properly utilized, is the key accountability institution in India. The C&AG of India, at the helm of the Indian Audit & Accounts Department, perform this responsibility, in an objective, professional and independent manner.

The primary responsibility of the CAG is to provide the legislators and through them, to the citizens of the country, independent assurance on the way the government has used and accounted for funds approved by Parliament/ State Legislature as well as the functioning of the tax system in the country. The process of 'reporting' (of its findings and opinions) by the CAG of India, therefore, is meant to fulfil an important Constitutional requirement in our country.

Growing concerns pertaining to both misappropriation of funds through corruption and sub-optimal utilisation of budgetary resources across a number of sectors / government programmes have led non-government organisations, social activists, policy researchers and media to raise questions on the quality of public expenditure in the country. The Union and State Governments too have acknowledged these concerns explicitly over the last decade, as manifested in the enactment of the *Right to Information legislation, initiative pertaining to Outcome Budgeting*, inception of the *Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System and the recent decision to discontinue the practice of Union Budget resources for some of the ‹flagship› Central schemes bypassing the Treasury system, among others.* Moreover, a large part of the government expenditure in India gets financed by taxes paid by common people across the country. Hence, the process of reporting of CAG's findings and opinions about the financial transactions of the government should ideally be designed and carried out in a way that it not only fulfils the Constitutional mandate for the CAG but it also responds effectively to other possibilities of enhancing public welfare in the country.

#### Types of Audit and Audit Reports

Audit by the CAG is broadly classified into three streams, viz. Financial Audit, Regularity (Compliance) Audit and Performance Audit. Financial audit is a process of looking at financial statements to establish whether acceptable accounting standards for financial reporting and disclosures are complied with or not. Compliance audit is meant primarily to ascertain whether the expenditures reported by the government were as per the legislative authorization through the Budget or not and whether the expenditures incurred were in conformity with relevant laws, rules and regulations. Performance audit, however, is meant to see whether government programmes have achieved the desired objectives efficiently and effectively and at the lowest cost and whether its benefits are reaching the intended beneficiaries or not.

Apart from these, the CAG carries out the following types of audit,

- Supplementary Audit: the supplementary audit carried out by the CAG includes audit of PSUs even after the commercial audit is done.
- Propriety Audit: this type of audit is purely speculative in nature. It focuses whether the expenditure carried out is in public interest or not. Hence, it moves beyond audit of numbers to question the wisdom of the expenditure made to identify cases of improper and wasteful expenditure of public money.
- Efficiency audit: this type of audit reveals whether the money invested/used yields optimum results. The main purpose of this type of audit is that, to prioritize and channel the investment, so that it earns maximum benefits.
- Environmental audit: this is a relatively new type of audit which takes into consideration the impact on the environment and challenges faced with respect to conservation and management of the environment. Number of audits on issues such as pollution of rivers, waste management, bio-diversity etc. have been carried out to identify critical areas and their possible solutions by involving all stakeholders.

#### Functioning of the CAG

As seen the CAG is empowered to audit all receipts and expenditure of the Union, States, Public enterprises, Union Territories, autonomous bodies, bodies substantially funded by the government etc. As per its constitutional mandate the CAG is required to table its report before the Parliament so that the same can be examined by the committees. The committees then make recommendations to the government after scrutinising the reports to taking appropriate corrective and preventive measures.

Though the office of CAG is based on its counterpart in UK, there exists a vital difference. The CAG in India has been made the officer of the Constitution, rather than officer of the Parliament as done in UK. As per constitution the CAG is obligated to report to the Parliament and Assembly that the money granted by them to the executive is spent "with wisdom, faithfulness and economy" and also that such accounts do not reveal any irregularities.

The CAG acts as friend, philosopher and guide of the Public Accounts Committee, the Committee on Public Undertakings and the Estimates Committee. In UK, the CAG is also called as the "official bloodhound" in the committee's service, because he "beats the bush and starts the hare; the committee runs it down and the treasury breaks it up."

The relationship between the CAG and the committees is complementary and mutually dependent. The CAG has to ably assist the committees in order for the committees to discharge their duties effectively. His relationship with the committees is therefore objective and purposeful, and his audit critique is impartial and free from fear or favour.

#### Watchdog or Bloodhound?

The CAG is envisaged to be a watchdog, keeping in check the financial streams of the government. Its role is to observe and report and the parliament is given the authority to act on these reports against the government. Hence, the CAG themselves have no power to intervene. But has been criticized that rather than overseeing the audit and reporting, the CAG is going after the government and is keen to find faults by carrying out so called innovative audits in the name of 'propriety'. The CAG's recent role in raking up controversy has put the spotlight on the role to be played by it as per the constitutional mandate.

Some of the key points of criticism are,

- The CAG's report are generally considered to be negative and in the nature of finding fault. It fails to understand the practical difficulty and constraints faced by the government while implementing the schemes. Thus, finger pointing by the CAG reduces the initiative and risk taking capabilities of the officials and ultimately curbs emanation of new ideas. It discourages officials from taking decisions which leads to shifting of responsibility.
- The CAG overreaches its duties of regulatory audit when it attempts to check the efficiency and the cost effectiveness, though the same falls within the spirit of constitution.
- The report of the CAG is damning and shows the administration in bad light. Also, there is lack of cooperation and administrator-auditor dichotomy which act as hurdle.

• Apart from mere auditing and finding faults, the CAG should also suggest ways and measures to correct them.

In the past half-decade, rampant corruption have been unearthed and the political parties squarely blame the CAG for breaching its responsibilities. The question is whether such criticisms are valid and can the CAG termed as a bloodhound for doing its duty. The 2G allocation and the Coal block allocation were rightly pointed out the CAG as causing loss to the state exchequer, though the validation of the amount is disputed, no one disputes that impropriety and illegality occurred while allocating the natural resources. Because of the issue raised by the CAG as the guardian of public exchequer, the government has made number of changes and brought in transparency in allocation of public resources. The CAG is also criticised that it cannot comment on the government policies, but the constitutional mandate given to the CAG is wide and it can point to any lapse that occurs. Moreover, the authority lies with the parliament to consider such reports and make the government accountable.

If the Constitution makers had envisaged the CAG to be merely an auditor, why would Dr. B.R. Ambedkar during the constitutional assembly debates describe the CAG as the most important functionary in the Constitution, more important than even the judiciary? And if the CAG was meant to be an auditor of accounts of the government, why would the Constitutional makers prescribe oath identical to that of the Chief Justice and Judges of Supreme Court. Hence, the Constitutional makers did envisage vital position to the CAG and deliberately made it an organ of the Constitution and not that of the Parliament.

Thus, as far as India is concerned the CAG cannot be termed as a bloodhound but neither is he just a watchdog. Good governance, transparency and accountability of the governments are being actively taken up throughout the world. The citizens are also enlightened and demanding information regarding the government's spending on various schemes. In this connection the CAG is carrying out all-around audit of various aspects of the schemes and programmes of the government. And if the CAG finds any irregularity, the same is pointed out and recommendations can be made by the committee to change it.

Vibrant democracy can only be maintained if all the institutions come together and work. The CAG merely cannot sit on the fence and criticise the policies of the government, it should also in cases where possible provide active solutions to make the schemes better. Also, the CAG should be careful and should not cry wolf, many a cases, policies and schemes of the government might have unintended consequences and the CAG should also take into consideration the ground realities. The Executive too should not consider the CAG to be an enemy to be detested, burden lies on the Committees to properly and effectively deliberate and discuss and make recommendations to the concerned ministry. The CAG should also make shorter reports separately for the public to understand so that they are not misled by the selective highlights made by the media and the press for causing sensationalism. Hence, all the stakeholders have to come on board to effectively carryout the constitutional mandate for providing efficient governance to the people.

#### **Office of Speaker-need for Reforms**

The office of speaker occupies an important position in our democracy. The entire success of the parliamentary system depends on him as he is the captain of the ship of parliament. Though the Prime Minister is the head of the government, in the Lok Sabha the Speaker is the conventional and ceremonial head. He is considered to be the guardian and protector of the rights, dignity and privileges of the House. The important of this position can be seen from the words of former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who states that,

*"The Speaker represents the House. He represents the dignity of the House and because of the House represents the nation, in a particular way, the Speaker becomes the symbol of nation's freedom and liberty."*

The responsibility entrusted on the Speaker is enormous and hence he cannot afford to overlook any aspect of parliamentary life. His actions come under scrutiny from both inside the House and outside, especially through media, therefore, the Speaker has to take informed and guarded action following due process and procedure of law.

The voice of speaker is considered to be the voice of the House. He is considered to be the true guardian of parliamentary democratic traditions. He is next only to the President, Vice-President and the Prime Minister, in the order of precedent. Adequate powers are vested in order to conduct the House in a smooth and effective manner, also it ensures that the independence and impartiality of the office is protected.

#### Functions of Speaker

The Speaker apart from conducting/managing the House, performs the following functions,

- Whether a Bill is money Bill or not is decided by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.
- He decides the admissibility of a question.

- He is the final authority for deciding the rules to be adopted for regulating the procedure of each House.
- The Speaker decides when a member shall speak and how long he can speak.
- He is the sole authority to decide to refer any question of privilege to the Committee of Privileges for examination, investigation and report.
- Any Member found to be violating orders or directions can be named by the Speaker and in such instances, the named individual has to withdraw from the House.
- In cases of pending Bills, the Speaker decides whether amendments can be moved to various clauses of the Bill.
- All the decisions and communications are made under the hand and seal of the Speaker.
- The Speaker of Lok Sabha presides over the joint session of the parliament.
- The Speaker has powers to interpret the Constitution in matters related to House or rules of procedure.
- He also has certain residuary powers under the Rules of Procedure.
- Under the 10th Schedule the Speaker is vested with the powers to disqualify members on grounds of defection.
- He accords recognition to the leader of the Opposition.
- The Committees of the House function under overall direction of the Speaker. Committees such as the Business Advisory Committee, Rules Committee, General Purposes Committee work directly under the Chairmanship of the Speaker.

#### Issues and Controversies

As seen above, the Parliamentary Rules and speakers' direction allow the Speaker to enjoy a wide discretion in various circumstances, including- allowing a resolution, admissibility of questions, amending a notice and importantly the power to adjourn or suspend sittings.

The Speaker's wide ranging discretion can be seen over the Rules 184 and 193 of the Lok Sabha, both these Rules allow for a discussion of an issue of importance, while the latter does not allow for a vote at the end of discussion. And the crucial issue, whether a discussion to be allowed and under what Rule is solely under the discretion of the Speaker. Apart from this the determination whether a proposed legislation is a Money Bill, submission of an impeach notice, no confidence motion, circulation of a Bill prior to its introduction are all decisions made by the Speaker which cannot be questioned.

The position of speaker too remains paradoxical. The Speaker gets elected from a Party's ticket and gets their support to be appointed as the Speaker, and once appointed, he is expected to remain neutral and non-partisan. The problem is that, the Speaker's term ends with the /Assembly and if he wants to get re-elected as a member, he has to go back to his party to get a seat. And the party might not provide him with the seat if he had acted against the interest of the party while serving as the Speaker. Recent comment on coalition dharma made by Tejaswi Yadav, the Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, throws light on the political nature of the Speaker's post, he stated that, "Had we had any intention to arm-twist the government into surviving we would have kept the Speaker's post". Hence, it can be seen that, though the office of Speaker is envisaged to be neutral, in reality it is not so, combined with vast discretion which cannot be questioned even by the Courts, there have been several instances where the Speaker has acted in partial and partisan manner.

The following are some of the instances where the Speaker of the Assembly has induced crisis by taking political decisions. The key to such political decisions was the anti-defection law, whereby the members are disqualified on the basis that they had defected, and such decisions is based on the sole discretion of the Speaker. In 1988, Tamil Nadu Assembly Speaker P.H. Pandian disqualified six senior AIADMK ministers for giving up their party membership, along with 27 other MLAs (disqualified for not attending a confidence motion), identified with the pro-Jayalalithaa faction. Sixteen MLAs in the Arunachal Pradesh Assembly (out of a total of 41 of the ruling party) were disqualified by the Speaker, Nabam Rebia, in 2016 despite not officially leaving the party or defying its directives. Similarly, the Uttarakhand Assembly Speaker, Govind Singh Kunjwal, disqualified nine MLAs from the ruling party in 2016, despite the MLAs not leaving the Congress or voting against it in the Assembly. Furthermore, while the MLAs had voiced dissenting notes against the Budget, the Budget itself was declared passed without voting by the Speaker. The Meghalaya Speaker, P.R. Kyndiah, suspended the voting rights and later even disqualified five MLAs in the 1990s, just prior to a no-confidence motion.

Thus is it clear that the Office of Speaker has been abused for narrow political and partisan interests, and the Speaker himself being the creature of the party who had elected him, has no other option but to toe his party's line in order to gain future benefits. Thus office of Speaker acts as a stepping stone for political ambition.

#### Way- forward

Reforms are long due in addressing the above concerns. The Speaker has been given discretion in order to deal with sudden political crisis and situations and such unintended consequences would not have been perceived by the law makers then. Therefore, bringing reforms according to the present circumstances will not violate the intention of the framers of the Constitution.

The first reform which has to be carried out is to curb the unbridled discretion given to the Speaker. Many of the matters where discretion is given to the Speaker can be codified, for example, what constitutes a Money Bill, who should be allowed to question, etc. Codifying such aspects will prevent disruptions in the House and will ensure smooth functioning. Also, the Speaker rather than exercising his discretion can follow the code and hence the members cannot have any grievances if established Rules and procedures are followed. Such automated rules will help in fair distribution of responsibility and power- recognise that the Members of Parliament are public representatives and do not require disciplining.

Not everything can be codified, some important issues related to public interest such as the impeachment, noconfidence motion, etc. need to be left to the discretion of the Speaker as it requires certain amount of application of mind.

There should also be remedies in cases of wrongful or mistaken discretion of power. The judiciary cannot immediately come to the aid as the issues might be time sensitive. In such cases, Rules such as the Speaker's decision can be over ridden by certain number (majority) of Members present and voting. Hence, in such cases immediate justice can be done and the decision of the Speaker can be corrected, if so, wished by the majority of the Members.

Apart from this preserving the neutrality of the Chair of the Speaker is of utmost importance. Until 1996, the Speaker of Lok Sabha always belonged to the ruling party. The convention was changed when P.A. Sangma became the speaker and until recently the speaker belonged to the opposition. The Members who are appointed as the Speakers can be asked to resign their memberships of the party, they should not be given any further appointment by the government, and permanent pension can be provided with benefits, so that any future considerations can be negated. All these reforms require support from wide spectrum of the political parties and if carried out, will pave way for a healthier and vibrant democracy.

#### **Office of Profit and Disqualification**

The idea of 'Office of profit' first started in England through the Act of Settlement, 1701. Until 1919, members of the House who were appointed as ministers lost their right to sit in the House of Commons. The Commons Disqualification Act, 1975 lists the offices of profit that can be subject to disqualification, these include, judges, civil servants, Lord Spirituals (21 Bishops of Anglican Church appointed as members of the House of Lords), regular members of armed forces etc. In United States of America, Article 1, Section 6, Clause 2 states that, 'no senator or representative shall, during the time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of United States, which shall be created or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time and no person holding any office under the United States, shall be a member of either house during the continuance in office'. Thus, legislators/members of the house themselves cannot create an office and then be appointed to it.

#### Concept of 'Office of Profit'

The members of the parliament/assembly, hold the government accountable for their acts/actions. The main intention behind the disqualification made under the 'office of profit' is that, if the member holds an 'office' under the government, they might come under the influence of the government, and therefore may not discharge their constitutional duty of questioning the government in the floor of the house. The crux is that, there should not be any conflict between the mandated duties and personal interests of the members. Hence, the disqualification under 'office of profit' seeks to enforce the basic constitutional feature of 'separation of powers' between the executive and the legislature.

#### Definition of 'Office of Profit'

The law has not clearly defined what constituted 'office of profit'. Over the years the concept has evolved through interpretations and judgments of the High Courts and the Supreme Court. Generally the 'office of profit' is interpreted to be a position that gives the holder some benefit, advantage or financial gain. The amount of such profit is immaterial. The Supreme Court in 1964 has held that the test for 'office of profit' is the test of appointment. These include,

- **i.** Whether the government is the appointing authority
- **ii.** Whether the government has the powers to terminate
- **iii.** Whether the government determines the remuneration
- **iv.** What is the source of the remuneration, and
- **v.** What is the power that comes with the position

The Election Commission of India uses the following three determinative tests to determine 'office of profit'

- **i.** Test of pecuniary gain
- **ii.** Executive nature of the office

**iii.** Test of exercise of constitutional/executive powers while functioning

Thus, there is no clear definition to identify 'office of profit' and the interpretations by the Courts are guiding to help categorize them.

#### 'Office of Profit' under the Constitution

Articles 102 and 191 of the Constitution specify about the 'Office of Profit'. Under Article 102(1) and 191(1), a Member of Parliament or a Member of Legislative Assembly is barred from holding any 'office of profit' under the central or state government. The Article further clarifies that "*a person shall not be deemed to hold an office of profit under the government of India or the government of any state by reason only that he is a minister", hence, a being appointed as Minister does not fall under the 'office of profit*'. The Constitution also specifies that the number of ministers including that of the Chief Minister to be 15% of the total strength of the house, this is to prevent the government from appointing more number ministers in order to evade the disqualification under 'office of profit'. Hence, the total strength of Ministers is also limited.

Also, under Articles 102 and 191, those members who are occupying offices which are exempted from law are also protected. The Parliament and the Assemblies can enact law exempting certain offices from the purview of 'office of profit' so that the members occupying such posts are not disqualified. Thus the expression 'any office' gives unbridled powers to the parliament to exempt. The Parliament has enacted the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, in 1959 and amended 5 times (1993, 1999, 2000, 2006, and 2013) to include and exempt large offices from the purview of 'office of profit' disqualification.

More than over a hundred offices/posts both under the Central and State government have been exempted, these include, chief whip, leader of opposition, women commission, chairman planning commission, minorities commission etc. In 2006, 55 new categories were added which includes, NAFED, Haj Committee, Dalit Sena, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, Dr. Ambedkar Foundation, Waqf Boards, Temple Trusts, etc. In 2013, exemptions were given to the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes Commission. In 2006, the then President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had returned the Bill which had exempted number of offices from 'office of profit', unhappy that so many offices were getting excluded. But, subsequently he had to pass the Bill after it was passed by the Parliament without any amendments.

#### Courts on 'Office of Profit'

The Supreme Court in Agadi Sangama Case, observed that "profit means pecuniary gain other than as compensation to defray his out-of-pocket expenses that may have the possibility to bring that person under the influence of the executive which is conferring that benefit on him". In the Sibu Soren case, the Supreme Court clarified that, irrespective of the nomenclature, if a pecuniary gain is there, it is considered to be 'profit'. Thus, the mere use of the term honorarium cannot save the membership.

The Supreme Court in its seminal decision in the Jaya Bachchan v. Union of India case developed the doctrine of 'potential effect of an office' to ascertain the nature of office, which reads as under:

*"…The question whether a person holds an office of profit is required to be interpreted in a realistic manner. Nature of the payment must be considered as a matter of substance rather than of form. Nomenclature is not important. In fact, mere use of the word "honorarium" cannot take the payment out of the purview of profit, if there is pecuniary gain for the recipient. Payment of honorarium, in addition to daily allowances in the nature of compensatory allowances, rent free accommodation and chauffeur driven car at State expense, are clearly in the nature of remuneration and a source of pecuniary gain and hence constitute profit. For deciding the question as to whether one is holding an office of profit or not, what is relevant is whether the office is capable of yielding a profit or pecuniary gain and not whether the person actually obtained a monetary gain. If the "pecuniary gain" is "receivable" in connection with the office then it becomes an office of profit, irrespective of whether such pecuniary gain is actually received or not. If the office carries with it, or entitles the holder to, any pecuniary gain other than reimbursement of out of pocket/actual expenses, then the office will be an office of profit for the purpose of Article 102(1)(a)."*

#### Issues Concerning 'Office of Profit'

The concept of 'office of profit' may find legitimacy in a Presidential form of government such as USA, where the government is not responsible to the Congress and there is clear separation of powers between the Executive and the Legislature. In countries such as India, the Executive and the Legislature are interlinked, the Executive are members of the House and they participate in all the sessions. Hence, 'office of profit' in such a system leads to unnecessary complications. The rationale that if pecuniary benefits and position are not given, the legislators will become free and independent from the government and speak their voice is too farfetched. All ministers including the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister are members of the House, and expecting the ruling party members from behaving independently to that of their party/government is unlikely. Moreover, Schedule X of the Constitution calls for disqualification of members who speak or vote against their party's command.

Generally the idea is that the Parliament controls the government, but in reality the government keeps control of the Parliament. Independence of members cannot be ensured just by disqualifying those who occupy 'office of profit', much more reform needs to be carried out. In cases of coalition government and government with razor thin majority, because of the 15% cap for ministers, in order to appease and get their support, the members are given such posts which commands power and garners them some pecuniary benefit.

#### The Recent Case of AAP and Parliamentary Secretary Controversy

In 2018, based on the recommendation made by the Election Commission, the President had disqualified 20 MLAs belonging to the Delhi Legislative Assembly for holding 'office of profit'. These legislators were appointed as Parliamentary Secretaries. Number of High Courts have struck down several appointments of Parliamentary Secretaries even if they were granted exemption from 'office of profit'.

One has to understand the reason why Courts come down heavily upon appointments in the name of Parliamentary Secretary, while other offices are granted exemption as per 'law'. Explaining this, the Calcutta High Court in 2015, held that, the appointment of MLAs as parliamentary secretaries was an attempt made by the State governments to bypass the constitutional ceiling limit of 15% on the number of ministers. The Bombay High Court in 2009, held that, appointment of parliamentary secretaries in the rank of Cabinet Minister amounted to violation of Article 164(1A) of the Constitution, which specifies that the number of ministers including that of the Chief Minister should not exceed 15% of the total strength of the House.

Thus, it can be understood that the ruling government tries to influence the Parliament/Assembly by keeping in control the 'office of profit'. The government tries to subvert the Constitution by appointing legislators as parliamentary secretaries which is just a misnomer, because they are ranked, act, function, and wield powers of a Minister. In turn, the government get support of these legislators, therefore making this a quid pro quo, violating fundamental principles of separation of powers and independence of legislature.

#### Conclusion

It is time that some critical amendment is made and the 'office of profit' is clearly defined. Apart from pecuniary benefits, the aspects of 'power and influence' should also be included in the definition. An enlightened way forward would be to completely overhaul the provision of 'office of profit' as it has not attained its objective of making the legislators more independent and free. If indeed, the legislators are to be made independent and have true freedom of to express their views, the provisions of disqualification should be amended and the legislators acting on their 'conscience' and not on their party's whip should be spared. Such bold reforms will take long time, especially with the interests of all political parties involved, it is unlikely that such reform would see the light of the day. The burden therefore falls on the Courts to keep in check the activities of the government and clearly define and elaborate the meaning of the 'office of profit' and put to rest all controversies surrounding it.

#### **Codification of Parliamentary Privileges**

Parliamentary privilege/ legislative privilege is defined in the Black's Law Dictionary as the privilege protecting (a) any statement made in a legislature by one of its members, and (b) any paper published as part of legislative business.

These privileges have been provided to enable the members of the legislative bodies both collectively and individually to act and discharge their duties effectively. These privileges have given the Members of Parliament an expanded personal freedom and freedom of speech than that of an ordinary citizen, so that they can perform their parliamentary duties without any obstruction. Also, this concept of parliamentary privilege has two aspects,

- **1.** External- anybody from outside is prevented from interfering with the functioning of the house.
- **2.** Internal- the members themselves are restrained from doing something that amounts to abuse of their position.

#### Relevant Provisions Relating to Parliamentary Privileges

Article 105 and 194 of the Constitution of India confer privileges on Parliament and Legislative Assemblies as under:

#### **105. Powers, privileges, etc., of the Houses of Parliament and of the members and committees thereof.**

- **(1)** Subject to the provisions of this Constitution and to the rules and standing orders regulating the procedure of Parliament, there shall be freedom of speech in Parliament.
- **(2)** No Member of Parliament shall be liable to any proceedings in any court in respect of anything said or any vote given by him in Parliament or any committee thereof, and no person shall be so liable in respect of the publication by or under the authority of either House of Parliament of any report, paper, votes or proceedings.
- **(3)** In other respects, the powers, privileges and immunities of each House of Parliament, and of the members and the committees of each House, shall be such as may from time to time be defined by Parliament by law, and, until so defined, **<sup>1</sup>** [shall be those of that House and of its members and committees immediately before the coming into force of section 15 of the Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1978].
- **(4)** The provisions of clauses (1), (2) and (3) shall apply in relation to persons who by virtue of this Constitution have the right to speak in, and otherwise to take part in the proceedings of, a House of Parliament or any committee thereof as they apply in relation to members of Parliament.

Article 194 is an exact reproduction of Article 105. Therefore, the privileges of a House of State Legislature correspond to that of House of Parliament.

#### Question of Privilege

The issue of privilege has been contested by the House of Lords and Commons in the then revolutionary England. The main objective behind giving such privileges is that, the members should be free to discharge their duties and functions, including that of the right to vote and speak within the Parliament, without any fear or favour.

The 44th Constitutional Amendment made minor cosmetic change to the Article 105, especially the 3rd subclause, which conferred on the "Parliament, the powers, privileges and immunities of the House of Commons until no such law is made defining their privileges the specific provisions until so defined by law".

Dr. Ambedkar, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, stated that the reason for not defining the privileges in the Constitution is that, the privileges of the parliament are much wider than just providing freedom of speech and immunity from arrest and therefore was extremely difficult to define. Hence, as per his view, it was not possible, rather impracticable to enact a complete code of privileges as part of the Constitution and therefore, it was left to the Parliament itself to define and codify its privileges and in the interregnum the parliament was conferred with the privileges as those enjoyed by the House of Commons. Dr. Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar with regard to the interim measure adopted, stated that,

*"If you have the time and if you have the leisure to formulate all the privileges in a compendious form, it will be well and good. I believe a committee constituted by the speaker on legislative side found it very difficult to formulate all the privileges unless they went in detail into the whole working of Parliamentary Institutions in England and the time was not sufficient before the legislature for that purpose, under these circumstances, submit there is no question of codifying them at present."*

#### Dr. Rajendra Prasad's words sums it up,

*"Parliament will define the powers and privileges, but until the Parliament has undertaken the legislation and passes it, the privileges and powers of the House of Commons will apply. So, it is only a temporary affair. Of court, Parliament may never legislate on that point and it is therefore for the members to be vigilant." And until now the Parliament has not enacted any law till date.* 

## Arguments against Codification

The following are some of the points which specify why the parliamentary privileges should not be codified,

- Codification will lead to the judicial intervention and scrutiny especially in cases where conflict with fundamental rights occurs.
- Evolution of new privilege will become difficult
- The very sovereign nature of the Indian Parliament will come to be questioned.
- These privileges help the parliamentarians function, discharge their duties without any fear or favour.

This issue was examined by the Committee on Privileges in Lok Sabha in the year 2008. The committee had felt that that the allegations of misuse pertaining to the privileges was because of the ignorance of the procedures and it found that it had recommended punishment only in 5 cases since the Lok Sabha was constituted. Hence, it concluded that there was no need for codification.

#### Arguments in Favour of Codification

It has to be noted that the Article 105(3) is a transitional/ temporary provision whereby the Constituent Assembly contemplated that a statue would be made in due course codifying the privileges.

Other Countries, such as, Australia, USA, Canada, New Zealand etc. have codified and enacted statues. Australia enacted its statue in 1987. The Act prescribes a maximum penalty of one year imprisonment and fine of \$5,000. It prohibits any member to be excluded from their membership of the House, and it also prohibits contempt by defamation. Section 6 of the Act states that, "words or acts shall not be taken as an offence against a House by reason only that those words or acts are defamatory or critical of Parliament, a House, a committee or a member".

A UK joint parliamentary Committee in 1999 recommended that a Parliamentary Privileges Act should be enacted. But till now it has not been done. The privileges of House of Commons came to be reviewed again in 2012 and a consultation paper was presented to the Parliament by the Leader of the House of Commons and Lord Privy Seal, wherein it was stated that,

*"there have been a number of other occasions since the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege reported on which the extent or the operation of parliamentary privilege has come under discussion, all of which ought to be considered in the light of a general review. These include: a number of occasions on which Members of either House have used parliamentary privilege apparently to circumvent injunctions made by order of a court, which has led to reports from the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, by a special Committee on Super-Injunctions established under the chairmanship of the Master of the Rolls, and most recently by a Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions."*

- Codification can clearly indicate what constitutes breach of privilege.
- Codification can fix the boundary of the breach of privileges after which no punishment can be made.
- Court can come in aid in cases of violation of the code of privilege.

#### Supreme Court on Parliamentary Privileges

Supreme Court in *M.S.M. Sharma v. Shri Krishna Sinha* (Search light case), wherein the majority while seeking to reconcile the privileges viz-a-viz fundamental rights by the rule of harmonious construction, observed that, in case the Parliament chooses to enact a law on privileges, it will be subject to the test that it does not infringe or contravene to provisions related to fundamental rights present in part III of the Constitution.

In the Minority Opinion rendered by Justice K.Suba Rao, he opined that, equating Parliamentary privileges in India with that of House of Commons was merely a transitory provision and that the privileges were subject to fundamental rights. He observed that,

*"It may not be out of place to suggest to the appropriate authorities to make a law regulating the powers, privileges and communities of the legislature instead of keeping the branch of law in a nebulous state with the result that a citizen will have to make a research with the unwritten law of the privileges of House of commons at the risk of being called before the bar of legislature"*

The Supreme Court in *Kesava Singh In re*, in its majority opinion laid down the following propositions of Constitutional Interpretation,

- **1.** *The power of construing Article 194 (also Article 105) in regard to the nature, scope and effect of the powers of the House rests with the judiciary of the country.*
- **2.** *Under Article 226, the High Court has power to scrutinise the orders issued by the legislatures as the expression "any authority" in Article 226 includes the legislature also.*
- **3.** Article 211 provides unambiguously that the conduct of a Judge in the discharge of his duties can never become the subject-matter of any action taken by the House in the exercise of its powers or privileges conferred by the latter part of Article 194(3).
- **4.** *Article 212 ousts the jurisdiction of the courts in cases of regulation of procedure inside the House only and it does not act as a limitation on the powers of the court to test the legality of action.*
- **5.** *The fact that the first part of Article 194(3) refers to future laws defining the privileges as being subject to the fundamental rights is a significant factor in construing the latter part of Article 194. Such a legislation would be "law" within the meaning of Article 13 and the courts will be competent to examine its validity vis-a-vis fundamental rights.*
- **6.** *In England, at one time, the House of Commons was the highest court of justice. Because of this, the House of Commons came to be regarded as a superior court of record, with the result that the general warrants issued by the other superior courts were held to be exempt from the scrutiny by the courts in England by treating these warrants as conclusive. In*

*India, the Legislative Assemblies never discharged any judicial function and their historical and constitutional background does not support their claim to be regarded as courts of Record in any sense.*

As this case was made under Article 143-reference by the President, the President can either accept or reject it, hence this cannot be treated as a precedent. Moreover, in such references, only the questions for which reference is made will be answered. Hence, there is still several unanswered question related to privilege of parliament.

#### Conclusion

It is high time that in a democratic country like India, that the parliamentary privileges are codified and defined. It paves way for clear interpretation, wherein several misuses and clash with fundamental rights have occurred. Codification will revolve these pertinent issues and help define the limits of penal action for breach of privileges. Codification will help the victims approach and seek relief from the Court, and it will also prevent the legislators from using it indiscriminately and enable it to protect the independence of the House and not infringe upon the liberty of the individuals seeking to be critical.

#### **Parliamentary Control is Disjoint and Indirect**

Dr. Ambedkar made an exhaustive and authoritative statement on the general character of the Executive while introducing the Draft Constitution in the Constituent Assembly on November 4, 1948. He observed, *inter-alia*: "The Parliamentary system differs from a non-Parliamentary system in as much as the former is more responsible than the latter but they also differ as to the time and agency for assessment of their responsibility. Under the Non-Parliamentary system, such as the one that exists in the United States of America, the assessment of the responsibility of the executive is periodic. It takes place once in two years. It is done by the electorate. In England, where the Parliamentary System prevails, the assessment of responsibility of the executive is both daily and periodic. The daily assessment is done by members of Parliament, through questions, resolutions, no-confidence motions, adjournment motions and debates on Addresses. Periodic assessment is done by the electorate at the time of the electionwhich may take place every five years or earlier. The daily assessment of responsibility which is not available under the American system is, it is felt far more effective than the periodic assessment and far more necessary in a country like India. The Draft Constitution in recommending the Parliamentary System of executive has preferred more responsibility to more stability."

#### Relationship between the Executive and Legislature

The Indian system, represents a real fusion of the highest executive and legislative authorities. In terms of the Constitution, as also in actual practice, the relationship between the Executive and the Legislature is one that is most intimate and ideally does not admit of any antagonism or dichotomy. The two are not visualized as competing centres of power but as Inseparable partners or co-partner in the business of Government. Parliament is a large body. It does not and cannot govern, The Council of Ministers is the 'grand executive committee' of Parliament charged with the responsibility of governance on behalf of the parent body. It is drawn from, and remain a part of the Parliament and is responsible to the Lok Sabha. The relationship between the Executive and the Legislature, may be said to be that of a part to the whole and one of interdependence.

While the Executive has almost unlimited right to initiate and formulate legislative and financial proposals before Parliament and to give effect to approved policies, unfettered and unhindered by Parliament, Parliament has the unlimited power to call for information, to discuss to scrutinize and to put the seal of approval on the proposals made by the Executive. The Executive (i.e. the political Executive the Council of Ministers) remains responsible and the administration accountable to Parliament. It is the function of Parliament to exercise political and financial control over the Executive and to ensure parliamentary surveillance of administration. Executive responsibility and administrative accountability, are two different functional concepts.

#### Legislative control of the Executive

The head of every Government Department is a Minister and Parliament exercises control over the Department through the Minister. A Ministry has practically an autonomous existence of its own and conducts its business in pursuance of statutory provisions, rules and regulations or according to a long-standing practice. The Parliamentary control over the Ministry rests in the fact that any action of the Ministry can be called in question by any Member and the Minister responsible for the administration of that Ministry has to defend the acts of his officials. It is a well-established constitutional principle that a Minister is responsible to Parliament for all the acts of the Ministry and it is he who takes the blame, should Parliament disapprove of any administrative act. There can, however, be a case where a civil servant acts either deliberately or recklessly, outside the policy of his Minister or contrary to that policy. By doing so, he relieves the Minister of the responsibility of protecting him. But the constitutional responsibility of the Minister of Parliament remains and he has to satisfy Parliament that he is dealing with the matter adequately.

Administrative accountability means the accountability of the administration to Parliament. Parliament does not interfere with day to day administration nor does it control administration. Accountability to it is technical and indirect i.e. through the Ministers, and it is *ex post facto* i.e. after something is done; after action has ended. Also, it has to be based on specific grounds. Under the Indian system, after a policy is laid down, a law is passed or monies are sanctioned, it is administration which is required to execute and implement, Parliament cannot itself administer nor can the Ministers. It is, therefore, the officials and not the Ministers--who have to explain if things go wrong in the process of implementation.

In a parliamentary polity, Parliament embodies the will of the people and it must, therefore be able to oversee the way in which public policy is carried out so as to ensure that it keeps in step with the objectives of socio-economic progress, efficient administration and the aspirations, of the people as a whole. This, in a nutshell, is the *rasion d'etre* of parliamentary surveillance of administration. Parliament has to keep a watch over the behaviour of administration. It can enquire and examine *ex post facto* whether the administration has acted in conformity with its obligations under the approved policies and utilized the powers conferred on it for purposes for which they were intended and whether the monies spent were in accordance with parliamentary sanction. This ensures that the officials function in the healthy awareness that they, would be ultimately subject to parliamentary scrutiny and answerable for what they do or fail to do. But in order to be able to conduct meaningful scrutiny and call the administration to account, Parliament must have the technical resources and information wherewithal.

#### Tools of Control

The various procedural devices like the system of parliamentary Committees; Questions, Calling Attention, Half-an-Hour Discussion, etc. constitute very potent instruments for effecting parliamentary surveillance over administrative action. Significant occasions for review of administration are also provided by the discussions on the Motion of Thanks on the President's Address, the Budget demands and particular aspects of governmental policy or situations. These apart, specific matters may be discussed through motions on matters of urgent public importance, private members' resolutions and other substantive motions. Members are free to express themselves and to say what is good for the country and what modifications are required in the existing policies. Government is sensitive to parliamentary opinion; in most cases it anticipates that opinion; in sonic cases it bows to it and in some others it may feel that it cannot make any change consistent with its commitments, obligations arid political philosophy. Nevertheless, during discussions members have full liberty to criticize the administration for its performance and suggest how, it should behave in the future or how a particular measure should be carried out or implemented. The discussions are important for they indicate parliamentary mood and bring the impact of public-thinking on the administrative apparatus which may otherwise remain immune or impervious to public sentiments and feelings. It is as well that the parliamentary debates should serve to remind the administration of its duties and obligations. Parliamentary debates affect thinking and action of the administration in the variety of ways and the public influence which cannot be measured in terms of any visible units pervades through all the ranks of administration-high and low. Administrative accountability is thus laid down in these parliamentary discussions and after Parliament approves the policies, administration has complete freedom to implement them in the best manner possible but it is nevertheless haunted and guided by the various viewpoints expressed on the floor of the House.

Executive or Ministerial responsibility to Parliament or what is often termed parliamentary control over the Executive or the Government is based on-

- **(i)** the constitutional provision of collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers to the popular House of Parliament; and
- **(ii)** the Parliament's control over the Budget.

In both these matters, parliamentary control over the Executive is political in nature. The answerability of the Executive is direct, continuous, concurrent and day-to-day. When Parliament is sitting, the continuance of the Government in office depends from moment to moment on its retaining the confidence of the House of the People. The House may at any time decide to throw out the Government by a majority vote i.e. if the ruling party loses the support of the majority of the members of the House, its Government goes. No grounds, arguments, proofs or justification are necessary, when the House clearly shows that it does not support the Government of the day, the Government must resign. Want of parliamentary confidence in the Government may be expressed by the House of the People by-

- **a.** passing a substantive motion of no-confidence in the Council of Ministers;
- **b.** defeating the Government on a major issue of policy;
- **c.** passing an adjournment motion; and
- **d.** refusing to vote supplies or defeating the Government on a financial measure.

#### Why the Control is Disjoint, Indirect and Non-continuous

From the above it is seen that the Parliament is envisaged to be the controlling and guiding authority for the Executive, and ultimate reliance is based on the Parliament by the Constitution to keep in check the Executive. Moreover the Parliament is the will of the people and the Executive cannot act beyond the popular wishes of the Parliament.

But in reality it is not so. The Executive or the Government holds upper hand and thereby control the Parliament. The Parliament is made a paper tiger and its control is diminished and reduced.

Firstly, the Government controls the majority in the House, and hence, majority Members support the initiatives of the government. And if indeed opposition arises to a particular Bill the government will pass the Bill despite objections as it commands majority.

Secondly, if the Government does not have requisite majority in the Rajya Sabha and if it is unable to pass a Bill, it resorts to practice of passing a Bill by way of Ordinance. The Ordinance though irregular, is a way devised to subvert the control of the Parliament. Thus, the Parliament has no opportunity given to discuss and deliberate on such Bill and actions performed by the government too cannot be questioned retrospectively.

Thirdly, the Parliament has very limited time at its disposal to discuss and deliberate on all the Bills and issues. Most of the time the Parliament gets adjourned because of disruptions. Hence, all the mechanisms, such as the Question Hour, Zero Hour etc. which are devised to question the government on matters of urgent public importance, could not be carried out.

Fourthly, the Bills of the government are discussed by the various Standing Committees of each Department. Even this mechanism proves to be inadequate because, the Members are not technical experts, they only serve one year in the Committees, and the Members who are amenable to the ruling party are generally nominated to the important committees, the Speaker being member of the ruling party acts at crucial moments in partisan manner. Thus, the Committee system too is not effective in keeping continuous check on the Executive. Also, the Parliament does not have time to discuss upon the reports tabled by these Committees. These Committees act in background and the public do not have knowledge about the discussions and the reports submitted, hence the Executive have a free hand in working without any real control.

Fifthly, Parliament control over the Budget too is not effective. The Parliament passing any Censure Motion against the government will deem that the government does not command majority in the House. The Parliament thus pass the Budget as such with formal discussion, and most of the demands are passed as Guillotine, as there is no time to deliberate on each and every aspect on the Bill.

Finally, the control by the Parliament can only be indirect, as the Parliament does not have power to question/ validate any acts of the Executive as it is carried out. The Parliament can raise question only ex-post facto, that is, once the act is done. Hence, there is no real control over the Executive by the Parliament to prevent something from happening. The Government after carrying out its programme defends it in the Parliament, and by the time Parliament raises the issue, much time would have lapsed. Hence, there is no real time control over the actions of the Government.

#### Conclusion

Thus it is evident that the Parliament's control is indirect, discontinuous and disjoint. The control over the Executive can be made more effective by forming a Shadow Cabinet as present in UK, so that each Ministry is mirrored and its policies are scrutinized in real time. Popular demand will make the Executive heed to the Parliament and thus the government can be kept in check. The system can be made more effective by reducing the disruptions in the Parliament and making the Committees more effective.

#### **Parliamentary Committees and their Control over the Executive**

In modern times, the work done by the Parliament has increased multi-fold in volume and has become varied in nature. They have very limited time at their disposal. Therefore, they cannot give effective consideration to all legislative matters that come up before them. Hence, most of the matters are transacted in Committees of the House, known as the Parliamentary Committees.

The Committee system originated in India from the Constitutional Reforms of 1919. The Standing Orders of the Central Legislative Assembly provided for Select Committee on Amendments of Standing Orders, Select Committee on Bills and Committee on Petitions relating to Bills. Apart from this, there was also provision for Public Accounts Committee and a Joint Committee on Bills. These committees aside, the Members of both the Houses of the Central Legislative Assembly served on the Standing Advisory Committees attached to various Departments in the Government of India. These committees were only advisory in character and functioned under the control of the Government, with the concerned Minister-in-charge serving as the Chairman of the Committee.

Therefore, a Parliamentary Committee means a Committee which is elected or appointed by the House or nominated by the Speaker and functions under the directions of the Speaker. It periodically presents report to the House or to the Speaker and the Lok Sabha Secretariat is present to render assistance.

#### Need of the Committee

The legislature is burdened with number of tasks ranging from formalising the will of the people and legislate to make rules and laws, to supervise the Executive, so that the laws are implemented in accordance to their spirit. But in order to carry out all these functions, the legislature need time, advice, expertise, and these are catered by the Committee System.

The Parliament, being the apex law making body have to deal with number of issues concerning the country, such as- social, political, economic, welfare, national security, foreign policy, science and technology etc. Therefore, it is extremely difficult for them to deal with such issues comprehensively and in detail. The committees are therefore constituted to share the responsibility. At present, the Committees have become indispensable as they carry out varied functions required for proper and effective functioning of the Parliament. These Committees help the Parliament control the acts of the Government and scrutinize them by posing questions and deliberating.

Thus, the two important reason why the Committee system was devised is that, to assist the Parliament in carrying out discussion of public affairs and to scrutinize the administration. The following are some of the reasons for the need of the Committee system,

- More detailed and comprehensive discussion takes place as compared to the House;
- Issues are treated in non-partisan manner;
- Each subjects are dealt with accurately and elaborately;
- Expert opinion and thorough knowledge of the subject is undertaken;
- Allows more time for the Parliament by sharing its work;

• The committees consists of members from opposition party and other parties, making it non-sectarian and provide very beneficial and thoughtful suggestions.

According to G.V. Mavalankar, former speaker of the Lok Sabha, the following are the reasons for creation of the committee system,

- **(a)** to associate with and train a large number of legilslators, in order to make them aware of the governmental affairs,
- **(b)** to exercise control over the executive,
- **(c)** to influence the policies of the Government, and
- **(d)** to act as an interface between the Government and the general public.

#### Functions of the Committee

The functions of the Committees can be categorized generally into two- deliberative and executive. There is another category, called as investigative, which scrutinises the executive action. The first two are facilitative or consultative, while the third function empowers the committee to be the watchdog of transparency and accountability. Also, it takes the issue closer to the public as it reports on the failures of the government and forces it to take remedial measures.

The Parliament does not have enough time in its hands to scrutinize, debate and deliberate on each and every Bill it has to pass. It is nearly impossible to take up each Bill for proper consideration. Hence, the Committee system is the effective way to carry out scrutiny, investigation and control of the public accounts. Also, the government can pass large number of Bills and the committees can look into details of such Bills and process them quickly. The Committee can dwell deep into content and subject matter of the Bill, the same which will not be possible in the House.

Apart from legislative functions, the Committees also act as the link between law making and law implementation. The Committees help identify lapses in administration and thereby lead to better governance. They thus bring efficiency to the administration. They keep the government in check and prevent it from violating any Law or Rules in force.

The Committees also bring in specialised contribution. They are constituted by pooling in talents and resources from all parties in the House. The Committees thus tone by the debate and increase the efficiency. It acts a forum to utilize experiences and abilities of the Members of the House, which otherwise will go waste. Informed debate takes place, making the work worthwhile. These ultimately reduce the workload of the Parliament, which can focus more on other important and pertinent issues.

These Committees also act as training ground for future ministers, presiding officers. They provide on hand experience of potential problems of governance. Detailed discussion on minute details, backed up by research and information, helps young members to learn from their seniors. It can be said that the real business of the House is carried out in the small Committees. The House while passing the Bill, for sake of formality debates it, and quite often ratifies the decision taken by the Committees.

Also the Committees are immune from the disruptions of the Parliament as they are held behind closed doors. Hence, they function despite whether Parliament functions or not. Another feature of the Committee is the engagement with the relevant stakeholders and the power to summon witnesses. The Committee often seek feedback from the citizens and experts on various subject matters, for example, the RBI Governor was summoned by the Finance Committee on the subject of demonetization etc.

After such detailed deliberations the reports are submitted before the Parliament. These become the fundamental basis for discussion in the Parliament and add value to the subject matter. Apart from this, the Committees also publish status report of implementation of their recommendations.

#### Issues in the Committee System

The Standing Committees have helped improve the Parliament's ability to examine the policies in a better manner, but there are several challenges that need our attention.

- **Need for Longer Tenure for Members:** The Committee system is designed in such a way that a small group of legislators develop expertise in particular subject matter and hence deliberate in a better manner. But at present, the members are nominated to the Committees for one year, and they are rotated after that, hence shifting them defeats the very purpose as they cannot become expertise in any subject. In a recent discourse, the Vice-President, the Chairman of Rajya Sabha emphasised on the need to extend the tenure of the members in the Committee system.
- **Research Support:** The Committees deliberate matters that are technical in nature. In order for the members to gain in-depth understanding and thereby provide qualitative recommendations, it is imperative that they are made available qualitative research on the subject matter. Providing them with institutional support will help them examine and analyse complex policy issues more effectively.

- **Fewer bills Referred:** In order to strengthen the law making process it is critical that the Bills are properly scrutinized by the Standing Committee before their passage. But, there is no specific rule that all Bills are to be referred to the Committees. The Ministry tabling the Bill, as a convention, recommends to the Speaker to refer the Bill to the Standing Committee. The 14th and 15th Lok Sabha saw around 60 percent and 71 percent of the Bills being referred to the committees, and this number has drastically reduced in the 16th Lok Sabha, which has only referred 27 percent of the Bills to the Committees. Also, the attendance of the members in the Committee is a cause of concern as the number has reduced to 50 percent since 2014–15.
- **Discussion of Committee Reports:** The Committees after discussion with the stakeholders and thorough analysis make several recommendations in their report. But all these are only recommendatory in nature and hence, the executive have no obligation to accept them. All the reports of the Committees are not taken up for discussion by the Parliament, and sometimes these reports are just made as passing reference in the debates. Hence, several of the recommendations are neither discussed nor implemented.

All these issues also find mention in the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution, 2002 (NCRWC).

#### Way Forward

The Committees also scrutinize the financial aspects like the budget. At present, the Standing Committees analyse the budgets of the respective ministries. The NCRWC recommends for reducing the number of committees and entrusting the committees with additional responsibility of financial oversight and thus avoid overlapping of work. There is also recommendation for establishing a Standing Committee on Economy for effectively deliberating the economic policies and their implementation.

Examples from other countries can be considered to bring in much needed reforms. For example, in British House of Commons, committees interact in certain overlapping subjects. Committees on defence, international development, foreign affairs, and trade and industry form the Quadripartite Committee which examines arm export licenses of the government.

In number of countries, the Ministers appear before the Committees to defend their policies. In India, functionaries except the Ministers appear before the committees.

The quality of the laws can be improved and implementation challenges can be reduced by strengthening the committee system. The need of the hour is therefore, to effectively utilise the committees to strengthen the Parliament as a deliberative body which can carry out proper oversight of the executive.

#### **Anti-Defection Law-intent and its Impact**

Defection is defined as 'to abandon a position or association, often to join an opposing group' which essentially describes a situation when a member of a particular party abandons his loyalty towards that party and provides his support (in the form of his vote or otherwise) to another party.

The Anti-Defection Law was passed through the 52nd Amendment in 1985, which added the Tenth Schedule to the Indian Constitution which detailed the grounds of defections and also prescribes disqualification for the defectors of a house of Parliament/state legislature.

It was again amended by the 91st Amendment Act, 2003. Prior to this amendment, a 'defection' by one-third members of a political party in the legislature was considered to be a 'merger'. This amendment changed and made that, at least two-third of the members of the political party have to be in favour of such merger for it to be valid. It also made mandatory, that those who wish to shift party should resign their seat in the legislature, and hence they have to seek re-election if they wish to defect.

The main intent of the law was to combat '**the evil of political defections**' and to bring in stability to the government. The major unintended consequence of the act is hindering the elected members from voting on their own conscience when there is party whip issued on the matter. To overcome this issue of forced voting, many committees have been set up to modify the act by amendment and to provide freedom of expression of individual MPs.

#### Intent of Law

Assuming the right intent of lawmakers, the legislation was aimed

- **1.** To reduce the power of money used for alluring elected members to make or break a government and strengthen parliamentary democracy by prohibiting floor-crossing.
- **2.** To bring stability to the government and the political parties; and not let the government to be held at ransom by few elected members.
- **3.** To make elected members responsible and accountable to the group of voters who have casted their vote because their loyalty and affinity to the party.

**4.** To make the elected member loyal to the political party on whose party symbol and support the person got elected to the house.

However, with hindsight, outlawing party defections invites observers to speculate about the framers' intentions. Was it to produce competitive party systems or to consolidate power within existing parties? It may be led to believe that the law was proposed with some erroneous intentions, and besides that it has led to unintended consequences including an autocratic party system, quelling of dissent and making of false leaders.

#### **Grounds of disqualification by anti-defection act 1985**

#### **1. Member belonging to political parties**

- **a.** If an elected member voluntarily gives up his membership of a political party.
- **b.** If he votes or abstains from voting in such House contrary to any direction issued by his political party or anyone authorized to do so (whip), without obtaining prior permission. As a pre-condition for his disqualification, his abstention from voting should not be condoned by his party or the authorized person within 15 days of such incident.
- **2. Member elected otherwise than as candidate set up by any political party**
  - **a.** If Independent member joins a political party post-election.
- **3. Nominated members**
  - **a.** If a nominated member joins a political party after six months of his nomination to legislature.

#### Authority Concerning Anti-defection

The law states that only the presiding officer, that is, Chairman or the Speaker of a House, can make decisions on disqualification of a member under this Schedule, and his/her decision is final. If a question arises on the presiding officer on the subject of disqualification, then the decision shall be made by a newly elected presiding officer (principle of natural justice). The law states that the Presiding Officer's decision is final and not subject to judicial review. The Supreme Court struck down this condition partly and held that no judicial intervention shall be made until the presiding officer gives his order. However, the final decision can be appealed in the High Courts and Supreme Court.

The Chairman or the Speaker of a House has also been empowered to make rules for giving effect to the provisions of the Tenth Schedule. The rules are required to be laid before each House and are subject to modifications/ disapproval by the House.

#### Exceptions Provided in Tenth Schedule

#### **a. Cases of Split**

No member shall be disqualified for being member of a group which has arisen as a result of split in his original political party and such a group shall consists of not less than one third members of the legislative party concerned.

**This provision (paragraph 3) has since been omitted from the Tenth Schedule by the Constitution (91st Amendment) Act, 2003, which came into force with effect from 1 January, 2004. Consequent upon the omission of Paragraph 3, it is not now permissible to claim a split in the legislature party.**

#### **b. Cases of Merger**

At least two-thirds of the members of a party have to be in favour of a 'merger' for it to have validity in the eyes of the law. The tenth schedule states, 'The merger of the original political party or a member of a House shall be deemed to have taken place if, and only if, not less than two-thirds of the members of the legislature party concerned have agreed to such merger.'

The Dinesh Goswami Committee on Electoral Reforms, the Law Commission in its report on 'Reform of Electoral Laws' and the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) all recommended the deletion of the Tenth Schedule provision regarding exemption from disqualification in case of a split.

**c. Exemption to Persons Elected to the Office of Speaker/Chairman or Deputy Speaker/Deputy Chairman**

No disqualification is incurred by a person who has been elected to the office of the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker of the House of the People or of the Legislative Assembly of a State or to the Office of the Deputy Chairman of the Council of States or the Chairman or the Deputy Chairman of the Legislative Council of a State if he severes his connections with his political party after such election. Also, no disqualification is incurred if he, having given up by reason of his election to such office, his membership of the political party to which he belonged immediately before such election, rejoins such political party after he ceases to hold such office.

#### **d. Election to the Office of the President**

Election commission made it clear that political parties cannot issue any direction or whip to members to vote in certain way during the presidential election. Voting and not voting will not fall within the ambit of the anti-defection law

- **e.** Obtaining prior permission before 15 days and not condoned by his party.
- **f.** Voluntarily joining non-legislative party which does not have single member in the legislature.
- **g.** Voting against the party in an ordinary bill for which whip is not issued and does not topple the government on its failure
- **h.** If expelled by the party the person continues to be the member of the house until he/she voluntarily joins a legislative party (e.g. Sasikala Pushpa TN – MP Rajya Sabha)
- **i.** Abstaining from voting due to proven health conditions subject to acceptance of presiding officer of the house.

#### **Advantages and Disadvantages of Anti-Defection Law**

| Advantages                                                                                                                                                                    | Disadvantages                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The important advantage is that it prevents shifting of al<br>legiance of the members of the party thereby providing<br>stability to the government.                          | This reduces the accountability of the government to the<br>people and the Parliament.                                                                                         |
| Importantly it promotes party discipline. It upholds party loy<br>alty as the person who got elected from a particular party<br>is prohibited from shifting to another party. | It interferes with the rights of the individual and his freedom<br>of speech and expression against policies of his party. This<br>effectively curbs dissent within the party. |

#### I**mportant Judgments of Disqualification and the Tenth Schedule by the Supreme Court**

The Supreme Court took upon itself to effectively implement the anti-defection law. It in its various landmark judgments has upheld the Constitutional validity of this law. And in other subsequent cases, it established that the Court is the final authority, and it could even question the action of the Speaker, who according the law is the final authority to decide such. The following are the most important judgments of the Court and the main issues it decided upon.

Union of India, AIR 1994 SC 1558)                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Swami Prasad Maurya and Oth<br>ers. AIR 2007 SCC 270)                                                                                                        |

#### **Some Recent Orders on Disqualification by the Speaker for Defection**.

The Speaker is the final authority to decide the cases related to defection. The law states that only the presiding officer, that is, Chairman or the Speaker of a House, can make decisions on disqualification of a member under this Schedule, and his/her decision is final. But this decision is subject to the final review by the Judiciary. He has also been empowered to frame rules. The following are some of the important decisions taken by the Speaker regarding defections.

#### **a. Final order of the Speaker Requirements for Proving an Inability to Obey a Party whip Due to external factors.**

**Shri Rajeev Ranjan Singh 'Lalan' v. Dr. P.P. Koya, JD(U),** (January 9, 2009). Dr. Koya defied a party whip requiring him to be present in the House and vote against the Motion of Confidence for the government. He claimed he was too ill to be present in the House. The Speaker concluded that Dr. Koya abstained from voting by remaining absent, and the evidence of the 'illness' is not sufficient to conclude that he was so ill that he could not be present in the House.

**b. When can it be Said that a Party Member has Deliberately Defied a Party Whip?**

**Shri Prabhunath Singh v. Shri Ram Swaroop Prasad, JD(U),** (October 3, 2008). Shri Prasad defied a party whip requiring him to be present in the House. In his defence, he denied that any whip was issued or served. The Speaker held that in view of the fact that there is evidence to show that the whip had been delivered to Shri Prasad's house, and had been duly received, it cannot be said that Shri Prasad had no knowledge of the whip.

**c. Whether Public Criticism of One's Political party Amounts to Defection?**

**Shri Avtar Singh Bhadana v. Shri Kuldeep Singh, Indian National Congress,** (September 10, 2008). The INC alleged that Shri Bishnoi often dissented from, and criticized the Congress government publicly, and had demanded the dismissal of the government in Haryana. The Speaker held that a person getting elected as a candidate of a political party also gets elected because of the programs of the party. If the person leaves the party, he should go back before the electorate.

**d. Whether Stories in the Print or Electronic Media can be Taken as Evidence of Defection?**

**Shri Rajesh Verma v. Shri Mohammad Shahid Akhlaque,** BSP, (January 27, 2008). It was alleged that Shri Akhlaque joined the Samajwadi Party in a public meeting. It was alleged that at this meeting, Shri Akhlaque had said that at heart, he had always been a member of the SP. The Speaker reasoned that there is no reason why news clippings and stories in the media would be untruthful. The Speaker therefore held Shri Akhlaque disqualified for having voluntarily given up membership of the BSP.

#### Reforms Needed in Anti-defection Law

The step taken to curb the menace of defections was indeed a landmark decision. But much more needs to be done in order to cure the system of such issues. Reforms need to be continuous and concurrent in order to cleanse the political system. The following are few insights:

- **1.** The decision-making power of presiding officers should be limited and should be altered on principle of natural justice, that is, no person shall be judged in his own case.
- **2.** 'Voluntarily giving up membership' should be defined and needs comprehensive revision.
- **3.** Political parties should limit issuance of whips to instances only when the government is in danger and not for other bills, that is, ambient of the law should be restricted to money bill and no confidence motion.
- **4.** The Election Commission had recommended that the decisions under the Tenth Schedule should be made by the President/Governor on the binding advice of the Election Commission. A constitutional amendment vesting the power to decide matters relating to disqualification on the ground of defection with the President/Governor acting on the advice of the Election Commission would actually help in preserving the integrity of the Speaker's office.

## **Delegated Legislation – Necessary Evil**

The legislature is considered to be the law-making organ of the State. But in the modern times, due to various factors such as complexity of legislation, paucity of time, and fast-changing environment, the legislature is unable to make requisite number of law needed. Hence, there is need for the legislature to delegate its law-making power to its subordinates to ensure smooth functioning of the administrative machinery, as it is not possible for it to deliver the quantity and quality required. And such a legislation, passed by the executive, on behalf of the legislature is called the **Delegated legislation**. The Committee on Minister's Powers stated that, '*the truth is, that if Parliament, were not willing to delegate law-making power, Parliament would be unable to pass the king and quantity of legislation which modern public opinion requires'*.

#### Definitions

The Delegated Legislation is otherwise known as Subordinate legislation. According to Salmond, '*Subordinate legislation is that which proceeds from any authority other*  *than the sovereign power and is, therefore, dependent for its continued existence and validity on some superior or supreme authority. They may be regarded as having their origin in the delegation of the power of Parliament to inferior authorities, which in the exercise of their delegated functions remain subject to the control of the Sovereign Legislature'*.

The Committee on Minister's Powers in England defined delegated legislation, '*as the exercise of minor legislative power by subordinate authorities and bodies in pursuance of statutory authority given by the Parliament itself'*.

Sir Cecil Carr states the following, '*Delegated legislation is a growing child called upon to relieve the parent of strain of overwork and capable of attending to minor matters, while the parent manages the main business. The delegated legislation is so multitudinous that the statute book would not only be incomplete but misleading unless it be read along with the delegated legislation which amplifies and amends it'*.

#### Essential Characteristics of Delegated Legislation

The following are the essential characteristics of a delegated legislation:

- **1.** There should be no extraordinary delay while framing of the subordinate legislation.
- **2.** The administrative authority should not go beyond the powers given in the parent act.
- **3.** Arbitrary and discriminatory rules should not be framed.
- **4.** The rules thus framed should contain, short titles, explanatory notes, reference to earlier amendment, etc. to provide clear understanding.
- **5.** The language used should be clear and simple.
- **6.** Tax or financial levies, charges should not be imposed.
- **7.** Sub-delegation, that is, delegation of a delegated legislation is not encouraged.
- **8.** Essential and important legislative functions cannot be delegated.
- **9.** The rules such framed should not act in retrospect, unless the parent acts provides so.
- **10.** In cases as required, consultation should be made with concerned authorities to frame effective and efficient rules.
- **11.** There should be wide and sufficient publicity to be given to such rules, so that the public gets to know about them.
- **12.** The public interest should be kept paramount while framing these rules.

**13.** The final authority to interpret these rules are the Parliament and the Courts, the administrative authority themselves are not given such powers.

#### Reasons for Growth of Delegated Legislation

The executive has a very vital and essential role to play in the era of 'welfare state'. Hence, it has become imperative to delegate powers to the subordinate authorities for taking necessary decisions. The following are the pertinent reasons for the growth of delegated legislation:

- **1. Pressure upon Parliamentary Time:** The Parliament is burdened with numerous issues that it does not have sufficient time to pay attention to all the matters. It cannot look into all day-to-day aspects of administration, which is therefore left at their discretion. Parliament does not have time to discuss all such matters in detail and hence delegation becomes necessary for better and effective administration.
- **2. Flexibility:** The legislative procedures are long and cumbersome. Some of the administrative matters require quick and decisive action, for example bank

rate, terrorist acts, foreign exchange, import and export policies etc. and only administrators with sufficient powers can deal with such matters expeditiously.

- **3. Emergency:** During emergencies such as war, terrorist acts etc. the country requires immediate steps and actions. And this cannot be made through a legislative process as it will take more time, hence such aspects are delegated and dealt by authorities, hence the executives are empowered to deal with such scenarios.
- **4. Technicality of the Subject Matter:** The Parliamentarians are generally amateurs and they do not have requisite knowledge and technical prowess to address all the issues that arise. Some matters such as, atomic energy, space science, drug and pharma policies, subjects relating to economy etc. are all specialised subjects and they have to be dealt by those people who are experts in these areas.
- **5. Experiment:** The legislation procedure by the Parliament is very rigid, and the delegated legislation is flexible enough to make experiments. Certain situations and problems require experiments and this cannot be provided with help of the Parliament.

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| It saves the limited time available to the Parliament.                                     | The Parliament has insufficient time to scrutinise these del<br>egated legislations, the Parliament does not effectively re<br>view them.                                          |
| They allow for rapid change                                                                | Such change is not effectively managed by the Parliament.                                                                                                                          |
| The Parliamentarians lack technical or detailed knowledge<br>regarding the subject matter. | The sub-delegation of powers cause further problem of con<br>fusion because of its complexity.                                                                                     |
| It is effective in quick response to new developments.                                     | The delegation legislation is enormous and it is nearly im<br>possible to keep track about all such delegated powers and<br>this leads to complexity.                              |
| It enables quick and minor necessary changes to the statute.                               | There is lack of publicity of such rules framed, hence public<br>do not know about them.                                                                                           |
| Withdrawal or amendment of the laws are very easy and<br>can be made without much hassle.  | It is regarded as generally undemocratic as most of these<br>rules and regulations are made by the public administrators<br>who are not the elected representatives of the people. |

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Necessary Evil

As per the Committee on Subordinate Legislation, Subordinate Legislation is **a necessary evil**. The tendency to delegate legislative powers to executive agencies has become so wide-spread and dangerous that the very existence and utility of the legislature are at their vanishing point.

Clothing the administrators with legislative power is regarded by many as an act of denial of civil liberties in certain circumstances. It is one kind of surrender of Parliament to the Executive; and it has strengthened the bureaucracy, and may turn democracy into **despotism and arbitrary rule**. Lord Hewart, describes delegated legislation as 'The New Despotism'. He further states that, '*It is not merely that in this instance Parliament is being outmanoeuvred or in that instance the courts have been defied. It is that the whole scheme of self-government is being undermined, and that too in a way which*  *no self-respecting people, if they were aware of the facts, would for a moment tolerate'*.

Sir John Marrott, who also agrees with the view of Lord Hewart, states that, '*It is my profound conviction that the prevailing and increasing disposition on the part of the British Parliament to confer upon the executive quasijudicial and quasi-legislative functions is wholly mischevious and ought to be resisted. The old despotism, which was defeated, offered a challenge. The new despotism, which is not yet defeated, gives Parliament an anaesthetic. The strategy is different, but the goal is the same. It is to subordinate Parliament, to evade the Courts, and to render the will or the caprice of the executive unfettered and supreme'*.

*Mary Parker Follet* considered the concept of delegation as a mere myth of the administrative theory. She believed that, 'authority belongs to the job and stays with the job'. Hence, the person who does the job should have the authority to do it. And according to her, the authority belongs to the function (job) and hence it cannot be delegated. And thus the term 'delegation of authority' is an obsolete expression and has no meaning. She also states that, 'Authority must be functional and the functional authority carries with it responsibility'.

Again the speed at which the laws are made and amended through the process of subordinate legislation is likely to endanger the life, liberty and property of the citizens and what is worse 'multiplicity of rules and amendments may exhaust the patience and defy the endurance of those who would understand them'. Yet it has come to stay. The problem now is not how to abolish the system or find a substitute, but how to ensure legislative control over subordinate legislation.

#### Safeguards, Controls and Suggestions

**1. Spelling out the parameters:** It is necessary to spell out clearly the parameters within which the delegated legislation should function. It is important that the legislature do not pass any skeleton legislation which can be completed only through such delegated process. There is need for defining the parameters within which the delegated legislation should operate.

The following are some of the limitations suggested by the Committee on Subordinate Legislation:

- **(i)** A financial power may not be delegated.
- **(ii)** Delegated legislation may not be allowed to have retrospective effect as it is the prerogative of the legislature.
- **(iii)** Power of judicial review may not be waived or curtailed by these rules.

- **(iv)** Language should not be ambiguous and be simple and easy to understand.
- **(v)** Blank delegation, that is, delegation involving rule-making on fundamental issues may be avoided.
- **(vi)** Essential legislative functions, repeal of law and modification in acts may not be delegated.
- **(vii)** Discriminatory rules may be avoided.

The Select Committee of Ministers' Power was appointed by the British Parliament in 1931, declared that the delegation of legislation is an essential aspect of the Public Administration, and if it is formulated properly will result in safeguarding the rights of the individual. The following are the recommendations made by the committee:

- **(i)** The legislative power should be delegated to a trustworthy authority which commands general confidence and not to some officer of inferior status who is unfit to exercise the power.
- **(ii)** If any particular interests are to be affected specially, the authority should consult them before making its laws.
- **(iii)** There should be means of amending or revoking the delegated legislation.
- **(iv)** The limits within which the delegated power is to be exercised ought to be definitely laid down.
- **(v)**Adequate means should be taken to ensure publicity to rules.
- **2. Legislative Control:** Such control is sought to be achieved by laying the delegated legislation, along with the bill, in the Parliament. Rules in Lok Sabha No. 70 and Rajya Sabha No. 65 mention that a bill involving such proposal of delegation of power shall be '*accompanied by a memorandum explaining such proposals and drawing attention to their scope, and stating also whether they are of exceptional or normal character'*.

This process does not serve much purpose as it is just routine and much information is not shared. The real control over the delegated legislation can be achieved when the rules made by the government is laid before the Parliament. These rules can be amended, changed, modified or removed by the Parliament. But, this aspect is post-mortem, as in India, the rules come in immediately and only later it is laid before the Parliament for the approval. However, in UK it is scrutinised before it comes into force. And in India, even after laying before the houses, it is hardly discussed. Hence, the Committee on Delegated Legislation suggested the following to improve the legislative control:

- **(i)** All acts of Parliament should uniformly require that the rule shall be laid on the table of the House 'as soon as possible'.
- **(ii)** The rules will be subject to such modification as the House may like to make.
- **(iii)** This period should be uniform and should be a total period of 30 days from the date of their final publication.

#### **Committees on Delegated Legislation**

There are two committees one each in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha which extend the control over the delegated legislation. The Lok Sabha Committee was established in 1953 and the Rajya Sabha Committee was established in 1964. Both these committees consist of 15 members. The objectives of the Committee are provided in Rule 320 of the Lok Sabha which is to consider the following:

- **(i)** Whether it is in accord with the general objects of the Constitution or the Act pursuant to which it is made.
- **(ii)** Whether it contains matter which in the opinion of the Committee should more properly be dealt with in an Act of Parliament.
- **(iii)** Whether it contains imposition of any tax.
- **(iv)** Whether it directly or indirectly bars the jurisdiction of the courts.
- **(v)** Whether it gives retrospective effect to any of the provisions in respect of which the Constitution or the Act does not expressly give any such power;
- **(vi)** Whether it involves expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India or the public revenues.
- **(vii)** Whether it appears to make some unusual or unexpected use of the powers conferred by the Constitution or the Act pursuant to which it is made.
- **(viii)** Whether there appears to have been unjustifiable delay in its publication or in laying it before the Parliament.
- **(ix)** Whether for any reason its form or purport calls for any elucidation.

The committees submit their respective reports to the House. These committees have been doing an exemplary job. They are not only scrutinising the legislations submitted, but also framing norms and standards for the administration to follow in the future. The Parliamentary control over legislation becomes a reality through these committees. But these committees cannot question the policy basis on which such delegation is made.

**3. Judicial Control:** The judiciary keeps control over such delegation through two tests: *Ultra vires***:** Substantive *Ultra vires* is when the con-

tents of the delegated legislation goes beyond the purview of the delegation spirit. Such contention can be invoked under the following circumstances:

- **(i)** Where the parent act itself is unconstitutional
- **(ii)** Where it is unreasonable and malafide
- **(iii)** Where the delegation is in conflict with the Constitution and the Parent Act
- **(iv)** Where it involves sub-delegation
- **(v)** Where it has a retrospective effect
- **(vi)** Where it is excluded from judicial review

In the Indian Express Newspapers v. Union of India, Justice Venkataramiah stated as follows:

*'A piece of subordinate legislation does not carry the same degree of immunity which is enjoyed by a statute passed by a competent legislature. Subordinate legislation may be questioned on any of the grounds on which plenary legislation is questioned. In addition, it may also be questioned on the ground that it does not conform to the statute under which it is made. It may also be questioned on the ground that it is unreasonable, not in the sense of not being reasonable, but in the sense that it is manifestly arbitrary'.*

#### **Private Members Bill – An Appraisal**

The power to make law is the most important power of the Parliament. This predominant function of law making is carried out through government legislative procedures. Either the government or member of a parliament can initiate legislation for making law.

Private Member Bill is defined as a bill that is initiated by a member of the Parliament who is not part of the government, that is, such a member is only the member of the legislature and not that of the Executive.

Any MP who is not a minister is a private member and he/she can therefore submit a legislative proposal for enacting it as a law. This mechanism provides an opportunity to private members to initiate legislative proposals concerning issues of public interest.

The procedure of Government bills and the Private Members Bill share a lot in common, but vast differences do exist between them.

The commonality between the two is that both follow a similar legislative process and the outcome of such a process is the same.

The difference in procedure between the two bills relate to the following:

- During the process of pre-legislative consultation and drafting
- In aspects relating to initiation, consideration and approval of legislative proposals

The designation 'Private Members Bill' is used in most Westminster system jurisdictions in which a private member is a legislator who is not acting on behalf of executive branch (Britain, Scotland, New Zealand).

#### Procedure of Private Members Bill in the Parliament

#### **a. Introduction**

The following section deals with the procedure of introducing the Private members bill in the Parliament; this will be helpful in analysing the bill effectively.

In Lok Sabha, the last two and half hours of sitting on every Friday are generally allotted for transaction of Private Members Business, that is, private member's bills and resolutions. If there is no sitting of the house on a Friday the speaker may direct that two and half hours on any other day in a week may be allotted to such bills. Business relating to Bills and Resolutions is transacted on alternate Fridays starting with bills on the first Friday of the session and resolutions on the next Friday and so on. In Rajya Sabha, the whole day after the Question Hour on each Friday is allocated for the transaction of private members business.

The procedure for notice is as follows:

- **(a)** A member who wants to introduce a bill has to give prior notice thereof. The period notice for introduction of a Bill is one month unless the speaker allows introduction at shorter notice.
- **(b)** President's recommendation if necessary should also be applied for by the member. The President's recommendation is necessary for introduction and consideration of this Bill if it involves.
  - Formation of new states, alteration of areas and boundaries of exiting states under (Article 3)
  - Matters affecting taxation in which states are interested under [Article 271(1)]
  - Expenditure from consolidated fund of India.

If President withholds his recommendation for introduction, the Bill cannot be introduced.

The primary responsibility for drafting of private members bill is that of members concerned. The Lok Sabha secretariat nevertheless renders necessary assistance in putting the bill in proper form.

Motions for introduction of all the bills due for introduction on a particular day allotted to private members bills are included in the list of business for that day.

After the bills have been introduced and before these are taken up for consideration in the House, the committee on private members bills and resolutions classifies the bills according to their nature, urgency, importance, and allots precedence accordingly for the purpose of consideration of the house. The time for their discussion is also allocated by the committee. And such relative precedence of Bills in a particular category is determined through a ballot.

#### **b. General Discussion – Motions after Introduction of Bills**

The member concerned may move any of the following motions:

- **1.** The bill be taken into consideration.
- **2.** The bill be referred to a select committee or to a joint committee thereon.
- **3.** The bill be circulated for the purpose of eliciting opinion thereon.

When all the clauses and schedules of the bill have been considered and adopted by the house, the member in charge of the bill can move that the bill be passed. If the motion is adopted, the bill is deemed to have been passed.

#### **c. Committee on Private Members Bills and Resolutions**

The Committee consists of 15 members nominated by the speaker. The functions of committee is to examine the bill, allot time to such bills and perform other functions related to the bills as may be assigned to it by speaker from time to time.

Once the bills are taken up for consideration, the government is left with the following three options.

- **(a)** To reject it, in which case government ensures that motion for the consideration of the bill is negative.
- **(b)** To support it, in which government answers that the bill is passed.
- **(c)** To give assurance that it will incorporate the points raised in a comprehensive legislation.

#### Analysis of Private Members Bill

#### **a. Private Members Bill – Golden Age**

The golden age in the context of Private Members Bill coincides with the Prime-Ministership of Nehru, which is often referred as the golden age of India's parliamentary democracy. Nehru's government encouraged such Bill's and ensured their passage in both the houses. Nehru took personal interest in strengthening the system and attended discussions and debates. The government respected the knowledge and commitment of MPs sponsoring the Private Members Bills, enlarging the scope of their engagement with the proceedings of both the houses.

With the active support of the government, individual parliamentarians could enact a new bill, and achieve praise for their legislative initiatives. Both the houses took active interest in Private Members Bills in terms of conducting informed debates by holding multiple sittings and meticulously scrutinizing the bills in the select/joint committees.

During 1952 and 1970, out of 14 Private Member Bills passed, 5 of them originated in Rajya Sabha and 9 in Lok Sabha. In terms of members, barring 2 independent members the rest were from the Congress party.

Apart from enacted Private Members Bills, there were also occasions when a number of such Private bills were taken up for consideration, giving opportunities for MPs and government to engage in a constructive debate.

This period also epitomized a healthy tradition of parliamentary debates during the consideration of these bills. Members of the Congress party enjoyed so much freedom that they could pilot Bills on subjects which ran counter to the stated ideals of the party. It was a vibrant phase during which governments approach towards Private Members Bill remained positive.

**b. Private Members Bill – An Oppositional Era** During the Prime Minister ship of Indira Gandhi especially during 1971–1977 and 1980–1984, the attitude towards such Bills got changed. During this period, not a single Private Members Bill received government support. It largely remained a routine and banal exercise. Because of the non-existent intra-party democracy members of the Congress party did not enjoy the freedom to express themselves independently and Private Members Bill was mainly seen as an opposi-

tion activity as majority of Bills were moved by members of opposition. Even during Janata Government 1979, members

of opposition parties still had higher stakes in Private members Bill procedure during post-Indira Gandhi period.

Only 14 private members bills passed since. They are listed in the following list as compiled by *PRS India*:

- **1.** The Muslim Wakfs Bill, 1952.
- **2.** The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 1953.

- **3.** The Indian Registration (Amendment) Bill, 1955.
- **4.** The Proceedings of Legislature (Protection of Publication) Bill, 1956.
- **5.** The Women's and Children's Institutions (Licensing) Bill, 1954.
- **6.** The Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Declaration of National Importance) Bill, 1954.
- **7.** The Hindu Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 1956.
- **8.** The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 1957.
- **9.** The Orphanages and Other Charitable Homes (Supervision and Control) Bill, 1960.
- **10.** The Marine Insurance Bill, 1959.
- **11.** The Hindu Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 1962.
- **12.** The Salaries and Allowances of Members of Parliament (Amendment) Bill, 1964.
- **13.** The Indian Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, 1967.
- **14.** The Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Bill, 1968.

The rights of Transgender person Bill 2014 passed by Rajya Sabha is the first private members bill to get Upper House approval in the past 45 years.

# Impact and Value of Private Members Bill

Significance of these bills cannot be measured merely in terms of numbers passed. Even unsuccessful proposals of the bills, had made members engaging in a meaningful debate on the subject of the bills and mobilizing support from different sections of the house.

Another prime determinant of success of such bills is its passage into law. Given the challenges they face, it is not their primary objective in introducing bills, a number of different motivation exists, which includes, addressing a gap in the law, seeking to change an existing area of government policy and raising the issue for further discussion and publicity.

The impact and value of these bills may be considered under following heads. Various Private Member Bills enacted for the following reasons:

- **1. Legislation on Contentious Issues:** Private Member Bills are preferred methods for introducing legislation on contentious issues of social reform on which public and parliamentary opinion may be too sharply divided for the government to take initiative.
- **2. Introduction of New Ideas:** Private Member Bills are useful instrument in introducing new ideas into legislative process and ensure that they are discussed and enacted.

- **3. Benefit the Government:** Government gets the knowledge and expertise, vigilance and attention of the private members especially of the opposition on issues of public interest.
- **4. Publicity and Public Opinion Building:** If this Bill reflects an issue of abiding public interest to which government has not accorded any priority such a bill is likely to attract much public attention. Proactive media reporting and an informed public debate can force government to consider the Private members bill.
- **5. Enhancement of the Stature and Profile of Private members:** It seeks to enhance the unique 'Parliamentarian as legislator' role of MPs. It enables MPs to articulate various shades of public opinion for common good. It sharpens their legislative acumen and empowers private members.

#### Obstacles to the Success of Private Members Bill

- **1.** The procedure is distinct from the government bills procedure. The procedural hurdles which hampers the such Bills are
  - **a.** One month notice for introduction.
  - **b.** Ceiling to number of bills that can be introduced by a member during a session.
  - **c.** The relative precedence of these Bills to be held through Ballot process, which is irrational and some deserving bill to be discussed wait for long time.
  - **d.** Prior presidential recommendation for introduction of certain Bills which includes matters concerning Article 3, Article 274 (1) & Article 117(3). If President withholds his recommendation, then the Bills cannot be introduced. This provision is derided as 'Paternalistic relic of limited democracy'. Since recommendation of the President is withheld on many occasions based on the advice of executive.
  - **e. Paucity of Time and Friday Schedule**  Two and half hours earmarked on alternate Fridays is a limiting provision. Lack of adequate attendance of MPs on Fridays struggles to a mars sufficient support in the plenary due to member's weakly constituency commitments. MPs are often not seen as lawmakers and seldom judged on policy accomplishments. Also there is no regulation on the time taken by members while participating in the debate on these bills, which therefore leads to consuming vital time.
  - **f. Absence of Drafting Support**  Legislative drafting requires legal knowledge, specialist

competence, and adequate human and material resources. The expertise in law making and financial support are not made available to private members. Often government holds back its support to these bills on grounds of flawed drafting.

#### Government Influence and Control

Government attitude is the most important factor in determining the success of such Bills.

Government looks for an opportunity to arrogate time available for these Bills under one pretext or other since government does not want to be seen lacking legislative ideas, it lack enthusiasm in supporting the Private Members Bill. It is evident from the fact that

- **a.** Around 56% of Private Members Bills in Lok Sabha and 65% of Private Members Bills in Rajya Sabha are withdrawn, since in Lok Sabha, members are not able to mobilize requisite support and government assurance that it will be bringing out comprehensive legislation, the Private members withdraw their bill. But government is seldom serious in bringing out legislation. Since this assurance is not monitored from the perspective of securing executive accountability.
- **b.** Since Independence, 28% of these bills have been rejected when the government disagrees with the legislative intent of the bill.

#### Conclusion

Overall it is important to note that as many as 712 Private Members Bills were taken up for consideration by both the hours during first 14 Lok Sabhas, but only 14 of those bills got enacted. This calls for serious analysis of the procedure and other aspects that impedes its success. The Private Member Bill procedure should form a part of parliamentary reform agenda in India.

#### **Criminalization of Politics and Politicization of Criminals**

### Criminalization of Politics and Politicization of Criminals

The understanding of the process of Criminalisation of politics is of special concern to an active citizen of Indian democracy because the Indian Constitution, following the British practice, envisages the principle of Parliamentary Supremacy. The Parliament is constituted out of representatives, the representatives are part and parcel of politics and the criminalization of politics would necessarily leads to criminalization of the representative institution, which would in turn gets reflected in the governance of this largest democracy. The problem becomes more acute when one takes into account of the structure that the real administrators, the Executive is drawn from the Parliament and they remain as an executive as long as they hold majority support from it. India, with still being a home to millions of poor and ignorant population, the subject can be neglected by its active citizens only in their own and their nation's peril.

As per the analysis made by the *Association of Democratic Reforms* (ADR), the candidates charged with crime have a 2:1 chance of winning elections compared with those who have a clean record. Hence those who have criminal record have a better chance of winning that those who are clean.

The Supreme Court in the recent case of *Manoj Narula vs. Union of India,* noted that "*A democratic polity, as understood in its quintessential purity, is conceptually abhorrent to corruption and, especially corruption at high places, and repulsive to the idea of criminalization of politics as it corrodes the legitimacy of the collective ethos, frustrates the hopes and aspirations of the citizens and has the potentiality to obstruct, if not derail, the rule of law." And it also stated that, "Criminalisation of politics is an anathema to the sacredness of democracy" and "Criminalisation of politics, it can be said with certitude, creates a dent in the marrows of the nation*."

Despite such observations, the Supreme Court held that, "*While it may be necessary, due to the criminalization of our polity and consequently of our politics, to ensure that certain persons do not become Ministers, this is not possible through guidelines issued by this Court. It is for the electorate to ensure that suitable (not merely eligible) persons are elected to the Legislature and it is for the Legislature to enact or not enact a more restrictive law. It is not for this Court to lay down any guidelines relating to who should or should not be entitled to become a legislator or who should or should not be appointed a Minister in the Central Government. This being the position, the burden of appointing a suitable person as a Minister in the Central Government lies entirely on the shoulders of the Prime Minister and may eminently be left to his or her good sense. In this respect, the Prime Minister is, of course, answerable to Parliament and is under the gaze of the watchful eye of the people of the country.*"

Thus the Supreme Court refused to interfere with the matters of appointment of tainted members as Ministers, as it was considered to the prerogative of the Prime Minister and it would be encroaching upon the powers of the legislature if it does so.

The political leaders are maintaining double standards and double faces, acting in public and revealing real intention in private. The entire election process has been taken over by the money power and the criminal elements surrounding it.

It would be wise to recall the memorable words of Dr. Rajendra Prasad on 26th November, 1949. He had this to say:

*"Whatever the Constitution may or may not provide, the welfare of the country will depend upon the way in which the country is administered. That will depend upon the men who administer it. It is a trite saying that a country can have only the Government it deserves. Our Constitution has provision in it which appear to some to be objectionable from one point or another. We must admit that the defects are inherent in the situation in the country and the people at large. If the people who are elected are capable and men of character and integrity, they would be able to make the best even of a defective Constitution. If they are lacking in these, the Constitution cannot help the country. After all, a Constitution like a machine is a lifeless thing. It acquires life because of the men who control it and operate it, and India needs today nothing more than a set of honest men who will have the interest of the country before them."*

#### Vohra Panel Report

The Government constituted a committee with Union Home Secretary N.N. Vohra as Chairman, and Secretary R&W, Director I.B., Director C.B.I. Special Secretary Home as members to look into the matters related to crime in politics and administration.

The report categorically pointed out that the crime syndicates and the criminal mafia organisations have developed enough clout, money power, and has established associations with the administrators, political leaders and others. The report observes the following:

*"An organized crime syndicate/Mafia generally commences its activities by indulging in petty crime at the local level, mostly relating to illicit distillation/gambling/organized satta and prostitution in the larger towns… In the biggest cities, the main source of income relates to real estate forcibly occupying lands/ buildings. Procuring such properties at cheap rates by forcing out the existing occupants/tenants etc., Over time, the money power thus acquired is used building up contacts with bureaucrats and politicians… The money power is used to develop a network of muscle*  *power which is also used by the politicians during elections."*

The Director Central Bureau of Investigation has reported that "*the nexus between the criminal gangs, police bureaucracy and politicians has come out clearly in various parts of the country*."

The Director of Intelligence Bureau in the report has also stated that,

*"there has been a rapid spread and growth of criminal gangs, armed senas, drug mafias, smuggling gangs, drug peddlers and economic lobbies in the country which have, over the years, developed an extensive network of contacts with the bureaucrats/government functionaries at the local levels, politicians, media persons and strategically located individuals in the nonstate sector".* 

In this context, the Director of Intelligence Bureau in the report has given the following examples.

- **(i)** In certain states like Bihar, Haryana and U.P., these gangs enjoy the patronage of local level politicians, cutting across party lines and the protection of Government functionaries. Some political leaders become the leaders of these gangs/ armed senas and, over the years, get themselves elected to local bodies, State Assemblies and national Parliament. Resultantly, such elements have acquired considerable political clout seriously jeopardizing the smooth functioning of the administration.
- **(ii)** The big smuggling syndicates having international linkages, have spread into and infected the various economic and financial activities, including hawala transactions, circulation of black money and operations of vicious parallel economy causing serious damage to the economic fibre of the country. These syndicates have acquired substantial investigating and Prosecuting agencies extremely difficult; even the members of the judicial system have not escaped the embrace of the Mafia.

Director of Intelligence Bureau in the report has stated that "*the network of Mafia is virtually running a parallel Government pushing that State apparatus into irrelevance. Criminalization of politics has been responsible for the problems related to law and order in our nation".* 

Thus, the essence of the Vohra Committee report is that "*Crime Syndicates flourish under political patronage*" and "*the politician-criminal nexus was running a parallel government pushing the State to insignificance*."

#### Politicization of Criminals

L.S. Rathore in his Presidential Address in XII-Rajasthan Political Science Conference on the topic "Political Culture of India's Ruling Class" observed that, "*Another feature in the political culture of ruling class in the politicization of crime and the criminalization of politics. Politicization of crime involves the competitive use of anti-social forces for the mobilization of party funds, for management of elections, for organizing meetings and conferences and even for recruiting workers at lower levels from among anti-social elements. It also means the misuse of criminal intelligence as a political tool for blackmailing political opponents*."

"*Criminalization of politics means direct entry of criminals into the political parties and legislatures, including parliament, it also means the use of criminal methods and tactics to influence political processes and procedures*."

No other vocation yields better and quicker results than politics, hence there is increase in taking over of the politics by crooks, rogues, criminals and other anti-social elements.

And today politics is no longer decent; the public life is encroached by hooligans and hoodlums. Notorious criminals, gangsters, smugglers and murderers are gaining control over the political system. Till recently these elements were only at the periphery of the political system, and now they have got considerable clout and power to manipulate the system itself.

Thus, it is seen that politics is not only getting criminalized, but criminals are also getting politicized. The important reason for this is that, the political leadership use criminal elements for their own benefits, and the criminal elements identify that being in politics will legitimize their activities moreover it gives more power and control, therefore they can indulge in more criminal acts. This is the reason why notorious gangsters like Arun Gawli have entered into politics. The system has been so much tampered that there is no way to prevent gangsters, crooks and criminals from entering politics and getting elected to the Parliament/Assembly and even from preventing them from becoming ministers.

#### The Process of Criminalization of Politics – Why and How?

**Muscle Power to win in Elections:** As early as in 1977, the National Police Commission headed by Dharam Vira observed: *``the manner in which different political parties have functioned, particularly on the eve of periodic election, involves the free use of musclemen and 'Dadas' to influence the attitude and conduct of sizable sections of the*  *electorate."* When a candidate thinks that he cannot come to power since the people have no faith in him, he chooses the other way, i.e., to generate fear to gather peoples vote. Moreover having musclemen at their command would help them to capture election booth and tamper the EVM or ballot box. Since the voters are common people in most cases, they are too reluctant to take measures that would curtail the criminal activities.

This initial practice has given way to another trend presently i.e., giving tickets to the confirmed criminals and history sheeters. In a country where most of the voters are common people who are reluctant to question the criminals, and where the institutional mechanisms entrusted with the task of conducting free and fair elections are either inadequate or corrupted, then fielding a criminal directly by the party would ensure victory for sure. Moreover, it would be more beneficial for a criminal to get himself elected as this would give him a direct control over administration. In case of India, though after the introduction of EVM and through various electoral reforms, elections in the past decade seems comparatively free from violent instances, it is not completely free of such instances.

**Money Power to Win Elections:** Corruption and criminalization goes hand in hand. The elections to Parliament and State Legislatures are very expensive and it is a widely accepted fact that huge election expenditure is the root cause for corruption in India. A candidate has to spend lakhs of rupees to get elected and even if he gets elected, the total salary he gets during his tenure as an MP/MLA will be meagre compared to his election expenses. How can he bridge the gap between the income and expenses? Publicly, through donations and secretly, through illegal means. A political party has to reach millions of voters, face Union, State and Panchayat elections almost round the year. Where is this money to come from? Only criminal activity can generate such large sums of untaxed funds. This facilitates the entry of criminals in politics. They have money and muscle, so they win and help others in their party win as well.

**Vote Bank Politics:** Those who do not know why they ought to vote comprise the majority of voters of this country. Therefore majority of the voters are manoeuvrable, purchasable. To gain their support is easier for the unscrupulous than the conscientious. The muscle and money power fetches crucial votes. Elections are won and lost on swings of just 1% of the vote, so parties cynically woo every possible vote bank, including those headed by accused robbers and murderers. Legal delays in convicting criminals ensures that the process remain unchecked.

**Corruption at the Institutional Levels:** Corruption had become a serious problem in our country that almost every democratic institution, right from the lower organs to supreme organs, is not out from its ugly tentacles. Corrupted institutions of democracy would naturally facilitate the entry of criminal elements. For instance the Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index (CPI) placed India at 94th rank out of 176 nations in its December 2012 report. India had a score of 36 out of 100 on a scale from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). First launched in 1995, the corruption perceptions index has been widely credited with putting the issue of corruption on the international policy agenda. The report is based on an average of 13 different surveys and assessments from 12 different institutions including World Bank's Country Performance and Institutional Assessment, the World Economic Forum, World Justice Project and Global Insight Country Risk Ratings. India was ranked 72 among 180 countries in 2007, at 87 in 2010 and the position was 95 in 2011. There are also instances of voters choosing to elect those parties which lure them with cash or kind.

This tactic of luring voters is effective in case of gullible illiterate and passive voters who are ignorant of the consequences of their action. It is this ignorance which is taken undue advantage of by political parties and the result-the voter is left to suffer for next five years. Most of the rural masses who do not have enough access to literacy or media or news channels may not be able to judge the political parties and there is the possibility of them voting for the wrong candidate. Yet another pertinent aspect is the caste factor. The caste factor plays a crucial role during election and many a time a voter prefers to vote for a party or a candidate based on his caste and religion, without bothering about the present scenario. Criminalization of politics can be prevented to a great extent if a voter is strict enough and chooses the best and ideal candidate.

**Denial of Justice and Rule of Law:** Laws that are either ridiculously in deterrent against certain offences or improperly enforced against convicted criminals further encourage the process of criminalization. A majority of the provisions in the RP Act provides punishments which are far from ground reality. For example Section 130 of RP Act 1951 Prohibits canvassing in or near polling station, soliciting the vote of any elector, persuading any elector not to vote for any particular candidate or persuading any elector not to vote at the election and portrays these as 'Electoral Offences'. Any person who contravenes these provisions is punishable with fine which may extend to two hundred and fifty rupees, says the same section. Even if the laws are deterrent to the level of disqualifying a candidate, the problem of delayed verdicts by the judiciary ensures representative institutions a safe heaven for criminals.

**Non-Transparency in the Functioning of Political Parties:** The major share of funding for Political Parties comes from voluntary contribution. One knows that undeniably such monetary sources influence voting behaviour. The high cost of elections provides logic for corruption in the public arena. A heavy donor invariably becomes a benefiter, as the law of pressure group politics would suggest. As the reader know already, in the 2003 order, the Election Commission of India, in pursuance of the Supreme Court judgment dated March 13, 2003 mandated that candidates for electoral office must submit an affidavit disclosing his assets and liabilities. This order, however, does not apply to political parties. Though all the major commissions of reforms viz., Law Commission, Administrative Reforms Commission, National commission for Review of working of Constitution and Election Commission had called for annual disclosure of accounts of political parties, this has not been enforced so far.

In 2011, an RTI query was made by the Association for Democratic Rights to the Central Information Commission since political parties had refused to share information although by all accounts they were public bodies. The appeals were upheld in an order dated June 3, issued by the full bench of CIC, which ruled that six national political parties needed to provide information as sought by establishing the RTI apparatus as required. The logic was that they were recipients of valuable state resources in the form of land, accommodation, and tax exemptions which amounted to "substantial funding" by the public exchequer. Accordingly, they were to be treated as public bodies and made answerable as such. But this has not been enforced adequately so far.

#### Consequences of Criminalisation

The primary sacrifice at the altar of criminalisation is that of governance, along with transparency and accountability. Expensive election campaigning favours candidates with strong financial background. Such candidates, when elected, seek to recover their expenses besides securing a corpus for the future election as quickly as possible, especially in the era of coalition governments with tenuous stability. The following are other consequences arising out of criminalisation.

• **Politicization of Bureaucracy:** One of the important consequences of criminalisation is the politicization of bureaucracy. The Bureaucracy is envisaged to be neutral without any affiliation of the ruling government/

party. The reason is because, the bureaucracy is the permanent face of the government, and if the bureaucracy sides with one party, and when the opposition comes to power, that government cannot expect the bureaucracy to work for them. Hence, instead of following the spoils system in USA, we have adopted the concept of Civil Service neutrality.

But in reality this is not so. The bureaucracy has indeed become political. And the important reason for this is criminalisation of the politics. The crooked politician team with the rogue bureaucrat to swindle and subvert the system. In order to successfully carry out nefarious activities, the politicians do need the support of the bureaucracy, either the bureaucrats collude or they remind blind.

The ultimate form of politicization of bureaucracy can be seen when the higher Officials are transferred when a party comes to power. The party which comes to power will appoint officials who are sympathetic, and support their cause.

• **Dilution of Representation:** People elect their representative to Assembly and Lok Sabha in order that they and their cause may be represented and that the government functions for their betterment and benefit. This is the underlining element of the democratic form of government. The government and its functionaries should work for the people. In the Preamble to the Constitution, it is 'We the People' who have given the power to all the elements of governance.

But, because of the criminalization, there is dilution of representation. The people's representative become representative of their own interest. They do not work for the people, rather they work for themselves. They invest their time in building up their coffers. There are numerous cases where we can see that first time MLAs/ MPs who had shown a meagre asset while getting elected, show massive growth in their asset when submitting nomination to get re-elected after their term. In those 5 years their wealth has grown multifold. Thus, we can infer that in these 5 years they have no represented the people who had elected them, rather they represent their own and family interest. And thus people's representation gets diluted and ultimately democratic process gets undermined and impaired.

• **Lack of Administrative Reforms:** One of other consequences of criminalization is that the criminal elements act as hurdle to bring in any meaningful reform to make the system more transparent, accountable and responsible. Any such reform to the system will prevent and expose their activities, and hence they take all measures to stop the reforms. This can be seen from the fact that the Right to Information Act came way later and that to after severe protests by the people. And the case of Lokpal and Lokayutha can shed light on how criminal elements within the system acts to stop any reforms. Even after the Jan Lokpal movement which galvanised the whole nation to demand for reforms, there is meagre progress in bringing in the Lokpal Bill. Even many of the States have enacted diluted version of the demands made by the people. The politicians themselves want to stay and prevent operation of such important reform. The criminal elements want to perpetuate status quo where they enjoy power and discretion. Reforms will break their cycle and expose their act to the public. Hence meaningful and necessary administrative reforms are being withheld and prevented from happening.

#### Efforts to Prevent Entry of Criminals into Politics

CPI's Indrajit Gupta says that*, 'Criminalization of politics is worrying because Parliament is losing its credibility'*. Jai Pal Reddy, a leader of JD says*, 'All parties have a nexus with criminals. The links just differ in degrees from party to party …. And in nature from State to state'*. As far as India is concerned, the criminal politics nexus goes beyond politics, it is not just the scramble for power. This runs so deep and wide that it virtually occupies every space in the state.

As Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer stated, corruption in public life begins with money in elections. Our system of elections is loaded with muscle power and money power, and these are abundantly available with the underworld. Section 77 of the Representation of People's Act puts an upper limit on the expenses incurred by a candidate. Other such election laws also recognise the danger of illegitimate money entering the political system through the election process.

But there are no regulations to control the money entering as donations to the political parties. These remain unaccounted for and are used in the election process. During the initial period, big businessmen and the industries sponsored and supported the political parties and its candidates. This practice continued and continues, and is supplemented by the kickbacks and the commissions received from foreign transactions. Experts are of the opinion that the political parties do not have enough legitimate money to fight elections, and hence are dependent on other sources for funding their campaign. And if the state starts to fund elections, may be such practices can be controlled and avoided. Such a state funding of elections is followed in Germany and United States of America.

Justice M.B. Shah's judgement in Electoral Reforms case on 2nd May, 2002, struck a blow to the Indian democracy by giving the voters right to know the full details about the person they are voting for.

And the Election Commission immediately on 28th June, 2002, implemented the Supreme Court's order within the specified time of two months. The Election Commission also sent recommendation to the government to amend the Forms 2A to 2E of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 which deals with the nomination process. The Commission also ordered the candidates to file the following information to the returning office:

- **1.** Past criminal convictions
- **2.** Pending criminal cases carrying a conviction of more than two years
- **3.** Assets
- **4.** Liabilities
- **5.** Educational qualifications

The Supreme Court's judgement is based on two important principles:

- **(i)** The citizen's right to know and informed, under Article 21.
- **(ii)** The power and duty bestowed upon the Election Commission by virtue of Article 324 to conduct elections.

Every citizen has the right to know about the background of the person whom he is electing, and such information should not be hidden from the electorate.

The candidates have no reason to hide their background from the people whom they are going to represent, and if they do, they have no business in public life. The Supreme Court has not invented anything new, it has worked out the provisions within the framework of the Constitution. There is sufficient precedent in both relating to right to know as well as the powers of the Election Commission.

#### Recent Decision by the Supreme Court

In a landmark judgement, the Supreme Court in 2013 ruled that the elected representatives cannot remain and continue in their office even if they had appealed to the higher court. The Court ruled that the representatives will be immediately disqualified from such date, if they are convicted.

The bench presided over by Justice A.K. Patnaik struck down Section 8(4) of Representation of People's Act as unconstitutional, this provision protected the membership of an MLA or an MP if he/she files an appeal within three months of date of conviction.

But this judgement did not act in retrospect, and thus sitting MLAs and MPs who were convicted before this verdict were not disqualified. Henceforth, an MLA or an MP will immediately be disqualified under Section 8 (1), (2) and (3), if he is convicted. Their membership will be protected if their conviction is stayed by the appellate Court.

This ruling jolted the political class, as henceforth if convicted they had no protection and will immediately be disqualified. The political parties then have to be very careful in selecting the candidates for election, as candidates having pending cases against them have their fate hanging in balance as the conviction will result in disqualification and therefore a new election to that particular constituency. No party would want to spend time, money and energy fighting for another election, and people too will become apathetic and the party will lose their support. Hence, the parties will be very careful in selecting their members to be fielded in the election.

The Supreme Court rejected the review petition filed by the government in the abovementioned case and upheld its verdict. It was an embarrassment for the entire political class. The review bench termed the judgement as 'well considered', and stated that it was 'not inclined' to grant review of the judgement which struck down the Section 8 (4) of the Representation of the People's Act.

The government immediately reacted by enacting an ordinance which was withdrawn subsequently due to public pressure.

#### Time-Bound Trials for Legislators

The Supreme Court has once again intervened to cleanse the political system, in trials involving MPs and MLAs, it has fixed a deadline of one year from the date of framing of charges. The Court now wants to ensure the tainted persons do not continue office, hence methods such as repeated adjournments, dilatory tactics etc. which delay the conviction and subsequent disqualification has been sought to be removed.

The Apex Court has asked the trial courts to expedite trials and finish them within a year; and if they are unable to do so, they should explain the reason for such delay to the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court. The delay in criminal justice system has worked to the advantage of the political class who are facing various charges in offences relating from corruption to attempt murder.

Many political leaders have managed to prolong their trial for years and they in the meantime stand in elections and get elected repeatedly and raise even to become Chief Ministers. Many such leaders stall the trial process by getting stay order or interlocutory orders from the higher court. The Criminal Procedure Code does not mention any time limit for completion of trials, but Section 309 says that once the examination of witness begins, then the trial has to be proceeded on a day-to-day basis until examination of all witness is over. This provision is rarely followed because of various reasons. It is impossible for a trial court to conduct the proceedings as the MLAs and MPs are influential and they engage lawyers who act to delay, and thwart the legal process. And thus the present judgement addresses this issue and empowers the trial court to refuse to grant routine repeated adjournments.

#### Conclusion

*India Today* magazine in 2004 published that, '*It is unfortunate that no countervailing force to check criminalization of politics is emerging. In recent court orders ranging from Supreme Court to High Courts to lower courts the Judiciary has been busy stumping the criminal politician, quashing his bail applications, ordering his arrest warrants and sending him to jail from hospitals. Unlike the campaign against tainted ministers in Parliament, this battle is neither partisan nor for each-finger-accusing the rival three-points towards you'*.

The **Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR)** in its report, suggests the following, The Supreme Court and the Election Commission of India (ECI) have undertaken some commendable steps for reforming the electoral process. But these two constitutional bodies are also bound by the laws enacted by the elected legislative body.

The ECI has achieved considerable success in containing the role of muscle power through measures such as the effective implementation of the model code of conduct and the setting up of the expense monitoring cell. Mandatory declaration of assets and existing criminal charges in self-sworn affidavits to the ECI prior to elections has brought in some transparency

Supreme Court judgments disqualifying convicted MPs and MLAs (*Lily Thomas v. Union of India, 2013*), barring those in jail from contesting (*Chief Election Commissioner vs. Jan Chaukidar, 2013*), directing the EC to bring the issue of election related freebies under the ambit of the Code of Conduct, the Allahabad High Court banning caste and religion based political rallies are all attempts to change the system. However, implementation of these judgements has faced unequivocal opposition from all the political parties. When the Supreme Court in its recent intervention (*Lily Thomas v. Union of India, 2013*) sought to prevent convicted MPs from continuing in office, the legislators promptly geared up to nullify the judgment through an ordinance. While the Supreme Court should be commended for taking long strides, judicial reforms targeting speedy disposal of cases could go a longer way in decriminalising the Parliament. The Supreme Court's recent order setting a deadline for the lower courts to complete trial in cases involving lawmakers within a year of framing of charges is a welcome step in this direction.

There is a widely anticipated participation of first time voters who are likely to constitute 10% of the electorate. This expected increase in voter turnout and recent civil society activism over issues, such as corruption, have stirred some awareness among voters in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. Whether this will make a difference to the criminal composition of the Parliament remains to be seen.

Levelling the electoral field by addressing the role of money power in elections is a pressing imperative. Deeper research into state-funding of elections and devising a metric to quantitatively measure the performance of individual MPs are areas of far-reaching consequences to the criminalisation of politics.

#### **Measuring the Effectiveness of the Indian Parliament**

The questions of how effective the particular session of a Parliament is? Or how effective is this Lok Sabha from the previous one? are hard to answer in an objective manner.

At a macro level, it can be said that the objective of the party elected to power is to improve the well-being of the citizens. This may be carried out by enacting appropriate laws, keeping effective control over the executive for implementation of such laws, and allocating such finance as required. The overall effectiveness on improving the quality of life of the citizens by such policies can be measured with help of indicators such as the Human Development Index, and measuring changes associated with it.

At a more detailed level, the effectiveness can be seen by focusing on the specific functions of the Parliament which are prescribed by the Constitution. In this chapter, to help measure the effectiveness of the Parliament and its various functions, a list of metrics has been given which is based on the research done by PRS India.

There is a limited scope of subject and content of evaluating the effectiveness of the legislative bodies. A few international assessments in this subject have been listed as follows:

**1.** The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association has recommended benchmarks for the Democratic Legislature. They have set standards for the procedural and institutional structures of the legislature.

- **2.** The World Bank Institute has published a study, Legislative oversight and Budgeting- A World perspective (Stapenhurst, Pelizzo R, Olson D, von Trapp L, World Bank Institute, 2008), this includes a metric to assess the effectiveness of the legislature. For example, they list out a number of oversight tools such as committee hearings and questions, and they measure the number of times these tools have been used.
- **3.** The Inter-Parliamentary Union has developed a toolkit to measure performance of the legislatures (Evaluating Parliament – A self-assessment toolkit for parliaments, Inter-Parliamentary Union, 2008). In this they have asked the Parliamentarians to grade a number of parameters on a scale of five. For example, they ask how effective is the Parliament in scrutinising the appointments to executive posts and holding their occupants accountable, and the Parliamentarians have to list the choice based on the scale.

The criteria to judge the effectiveness of the Parliament can be either qualitative or quantitative. The qualitative criterion though is very difficult to assess and measure in an objective manner. For example, we can easily count the number of bills passed, but it is difficult to judge the quality of such legislations. Even while measuring quantitatively, it would be difficult to say whether higher number is positive or negative indicator. For example, a large number of government bills passed in a particular session might indicate the effective functioning of the legislature, but on the other hand this may mean that, very less time is dedicated for the discussion of the bills and that legislature is not able to effectively scrutinise the proposals of the demands made by the executives.

With these constraints, the following framework for measuring the effectiveness of the Parliament has been devised. The following are the main functions of the Parliament based on which a number of parameters have been suggested to measure the effectiveness. They are

- Legislation
- Oversight
- Representation
- Budgeting

The main challenge is to identify which of these parameters can be used effectively to measure the performance and another is whether an aggregate index could be made by combining all these parameters.

The following are some of the metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of the Parliament.

#### ORDINARY BILL LEGISLATIVE PROCESS

#### Bill in the Second House

Here the bill passes through all the three stages, (I.e.) 1st, 2nd & 3rd reading. There are four options before the 2nd House:

- (a) It may pass the bill as forwarded by the 1st house
- (b) It may pass the bill with a few amendments and send it back for reconsideration
- (c) It may reject the bill
- (d) It may take no action and keep it pending.

In cases (a) and (b) the bill is considered as passed by both the Houses and the same is sent to the president for his assent.

On the other hand, if the 1st House rejects the amendments suggested by the 2nd House or in case (c) or if it is left pending for over 6 months, a deadlock is deemed to have occurred.

To resolve a deadlock, the president can summon a joint sitting of the two Houses. In this context a majority of those present and voting in favour of the bill, can have the bill passed.

#### Assent of the President

.

Every bill after being passed by both Houses of Parliament either single or at a joint sitting, is presented to the president for his/her assent.

(a) Providing assent to the bill

- (b) Withholding assent to the bill
- (c) Returning the bill for reconsideration

On the President giving his/her assent to the bill, it becomes an act and is entered in the statute book.

If the President withholds his assent to the bill, it falls short of becoming an act.

If the bill is returned for reconsideration and if it is passed by the parliament again with or without amendments and produced to the President for assent, the president must provide his/her assent to the bill.

Thus, the President enjoys only a "suspensive veto."
