# RIGHT TO INFORMATION

"The Right to Information Law of 2005 signals a radical shift in our governance culture and permanently impacts all agencies of state. The effective implementation of this law depends on three fundamental shifts: from the prevailing culture of secrecy to a new culture of openness; from personalized despotism to authority coupled with accountability; and from unilateral decision-making to participative governance".

—Second Administrative Reforms Commission

#### **THE STRUGGLE FOR RIGHT TO INFORMATION**

Right to Information (RTI) is an integral component of a liberal democracy. This principle is widely accepted and it can be understood by the fact that most modern states have enacted their own versions of the law. The Indian version of RTI is considered to be the most soundly drafted among its peers, as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in its appeal 'Eliminate Corruption, Enable Better Living' has hailed it as the best, in practice.

Like many other acts that empower the citizenry, this act had its own share of hurdles that it encountered through its years of drafting and formation. Thousands of activists put themselves through a relentless struggle to ensure that this act came into being. It began with the relentless fight by the civil society groups for People's Rights in Rajasthan that finally in 1997 resulted in the enactment of RTI Act in the state.

It was alleged during the 1990s that there was a rampant spread of corruption and malpractices in the implementation of poverty alleviation schemes in Rajasthan. The malpractices were brought to light by The Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS), a social movement in the state, which was initially seeking to understand the reasons behind the non-payment of minimum wages for workers in Rajasthan. It was when reports or information was denied to them, they realized that people were not being given a responsible and transparent administration. MKSS functionaries involved themselves in an extensive groundwork, which revealed a slew of malpractices in poverty alleviation schemes of the state. This made the public realize that they have to be informed of the policies, plans and administrative activities of the government. Thus was born a remarkable movement, which resulted in the creation of the first RTI law in the country, in the state of Rajasthan.

The movement was spearheaded by renowned social activists, Aruna Roy, Nikhil Dey and Changan Singh of the MKSS, with the extensive support of the common masses. It led to the Government of Rajasthan proclaiming in the assembly that they will come up with a law to provide access of information to the public on request.

After more than a year since the proclamation, the law was yet to materialize. Therefore, in April 1996, MKSS began a relentless struggle demanding the government to implement their prior proclamation in the Assembly. The demonstration was massive, with people from various walks of life participating in it. The government had no other option than passing the law and finally obliged in the year 2000. This became a shot in the arm for MKSS, as they began the process to realize the enactment of RTI throughout India.

MKSS paved the way for the formation of the National Campaign for Peoples Right to Information (NCPRI). Many organizations and human rights movements aligned themselves with NCPRI to bring about RTI Act.

In 2002, during the NDA Government headed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a Bill on Freedom of Information Act 2002 was introduced in the Parliament. But it did not become an Act.

In 2004, the UPA headed by Manmohan Singh included RTI Act in its election manifesto; when it formed the government, it started taking steps to fulfil its promise.

In August 2004, the National Advisory Council, the NCPRI and the commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) together made some changes in the 2002 RTI Bill and submitted the core document. On the basis of the core document, in December, the new Bill on RTI Act was introduced in the Parliament.

The Bill was approved by the Lok Sabha on 11 May 2005 and by the Rajya Sabha on12 May. The Indian President's approval was obtained on 15 June, and the Bill formally became an Act. It was published in the *Government Gazette* on 22 June, and from 12 Oct 2005, it was implemented.

Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

#### **EVOLUTION OF Right to Information (RTI) (INDIA)**

- The Constitution of India does not provide for the RTI as a fundamental right. However, it is inherent, within the scope of Article 19(1)(a) and Article 21.
- As a party to the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, India acknowledges Article 19 of the declaration, which talks of the right to receive and impart information.
- Supreme Court in various cases, such as state of UP vs Raj Narain, SP Gupta vs UOI, Dinesh Trivedi vs. UOI, Bhopal gas leak case, has asserted that the idea of 'Right to Know' is a fundamental right.
- Mathew Commission (1982): Emphasized the Right to know.
- 5th Pay Commission (1994–97): Recommended the abolition of the Official Secrets Act and introduction of RTI Act.

- 1995: The Press Council of India brought out the first blueprint of a model RTI Act.
- 1997: Shourie Committee another draft on RTI.
- 2000: Rajasthan and Karnataka enacted their own RTI Acts.
- 2001: Delhi enacted its RTI Act
- 2002: Maharashtra and Assam enacted their own RTI Acts.
- 2002: Freedom of Information act was introduced and enacted, but it was never notified.
- 2005: RTI finally enacted and got notified and came into force.

# **SIGNIFICANCE OF Right to Information (RTI)**

- **1.** RTI reinforces the idea of popular sovereignty.
- **2.** It promotes openness, transparency and accountability in governance.
- **3.** It is one of the viable weapons to combat corruption.

- **4.** The proper use of RTI will check the arbitrary nature or high-handedness of officials.
- **5.** It bridges the gap between providers and recipients of public services.
- **6.** It paves the way for a participative democracy by including the citizens in the decision making process.
- **7.** By enhancing participation, RTI strengthens grassroots democracy.
- **8.** It serves as a device to access to other rights provided by law.
- **9.** It creates an amicable ambience for transparency in government organizations.
- **10.** Results in effective functioning of the government thereby enhancing predictability.
- **11.** Access to information can empower the poor and the weaker sections of society to demand and get information about public policies and actions, thereby leading to their welfare.
- **12.** Promotes administrative reforms by exposing weaklings and voids in the system.

RTI and administrative reforms go hand-in-hand towards assuring good governance:

- **1.** RTI ensures transparency, accountability and efficiency, which are themselves goals of administrative reforms.
- **2.** RTI helps in revealing the shortcomings of the system, which leads to further administrative reforms.
- **3.** RTI is a novel measure that cannot be successfully executed until and unless supported by structural and procedural reforms.
- **4.** Constant requests for information under RTI can help civil servants to reduce the possibilities for errors and therefore can ensure better performance from the government machinery.

# **RIGHT TO INFROMATION ACT (2005)**

The Act specifies that citizens have a right to:

- Request any information (as defined).
- Take copies of documents.

# **Right to Information (RTI) AND ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS**

- Inspect documents, works and records.
- Take certified samples of materials of work.
- Obtain information in form of printouts, diskettes, floppies, tapes, video cassettes or in any other electronic mode or through printouts.

#### **Information Defined**

According to the law, the term '*Information*' has been defined as any material in the form of records, documents, memos, e-mails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars, orders, logbooks, contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, data in any electronic form and information relating to any private body which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for the time being in force.

# **Process**

Under the Act, all authorities covered must appoint a Public Information Officer (PIO) within their organization. Any person may submit a request to the PIO for information in writing. It becomes the PIO's duty to provide information to the person who has requested for the information. If the request involves or pertains to another public authority, it will be the concerned PIO's responsibility to transfer/forward the request to a PIO of the concerned organization, within 5 days of receipt. In addition, every public authority is required to designate Assistant Public Information Officers (APIOs) to receive RTI requests and appeals for forwarding to the PIOs of their public authority. The citizen making the request is not obliged to disclose any information except his/her name and contact particulars.

The Act specifies time limits for replying to the request:

- **1.** If the request has been made to the PIO, the reply is to be provided within 30 days of receipt.
- **2.** If the request has been made to an APIO, the deadline gets an additional 5 days, and thus the reply is to be given within 35 days of receipt.
- **3.** If the PIO transfers the request to another public authority (better concerned with the information requested), the time allowed to reply is 30 days but computed from the day after it is received by the PIO of the transferee authority.
- **4.** For information concerning corruption and human rights violations by scheduled security agencies (those listed in the second schedule to the act), responses have to be provided within 45 days post the approval of the Central Information Commission.
- **5.** However, if the life or liberty of any person is involved, the PIO is expected to reply within 48 hours.

If the information is not provided within the required period, it can be treated as a deemed refusal of information. Refusal with or without reasons may be ground for appeal or complaint. Further, information not provided within the time prescribed is to be provided free of charge.

# **EXEMPTIONS**

The following things are exempted from disclosure:

- **1.** Sensitive information, disclosure of which would prejudicially compromise the sovereignty and integrity of India; the security; strategic, scientific or economic interests of the State; relation with a foreign State or which may lead to the incitement of an offence.
- **2.** Information which has been forbidden to be published by any court of law or tribunal or any disclosure that would constitute to contempt of court.
- **3.** Information, the disclosure of which would cause a breach of privilege of Parliament or the State Legislature.
- **4.** Information including commercial confidence, trade secrets or intellectual property, the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of a third party, unless the competent authority is satisfied that larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information.
- **5.** Information available to a person in his/her fiduciary relationship, unless the competent authority is satisfied that the larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information.
- **6.** Information received in confidence from foreign Governments.
- **7.** Information, the disclosure of which would endanger the life or safety of any person(s) or identify the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes.
- **8.** Information which would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders.
- **9.** Cabinet papers including records of deliberations of the Council of Ministers, Secretaries and other officers.
- **10.** Information which relates to personal information, the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual. However, such information, which cannot be denied to the parliament or a state legislature, is not exempted under this purpose.

Notwithstanding any of the exemptions listed above, a public authority may allow access to information, if public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests.

#### **Exclusions**

The following investigation and intelligence agencies are exempted from the purview of this law:

Central Intelligence any Security agencies specified in the Second Schedule like IB, RAW, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Central Economic Intelligence Bureau, Directorate of Enforcement, Narcotics Control Bureau, Aviation Research Centre, Special Frontier Force, BSF, CRPF, ITBP, CISF, NSG, Assam Rifles, Special Service Bureau, Special Branch (CID), Andaman and Nicobar, The Crime Branch-CID-CB, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Special Branch, Lakshadweep Police, Agencies specified by the State Governments through a notification will also be excluded.

This exclusion is however not absolute and these organizations are required to provide information, when accused of corruption and/or human rights violations.

#### **IMPLEMENTING ISSUES OF THE ACT AND THE SOLUTIONS**

- **1.** Appointment of Central Information Commissioners and State Information Commissioners should be done in a bipartisan manner involving the leader of opposition. Chief Justices of SC and HC may also be included.
- **2.** The Central Information Commission should be geographically dispersed across the country with at least four regional offices headed by an official in the ranks of commissioner. This is in addition to the regional offices of State Information Commissions.
- **3.** Information commissions should be constituted by adequately representing different sections of society, instead of having a preponderance of Civil Servants. It is advisable to have at least half of the members as non-civil servants.
- **4.** Private institutions that enjoy natural monopoly, or whose functions impinge on citizens lives substantially, must come under RTI.
- **5.** Definition of 'Substantially Financed' has been taken variously. So commission has defined it:

Organisations that have received 50% of annual operating costs or a sum more than 1 crore preceding 3 years, should come under RTI, apart from this, if the body receives a minimum funding of Rs5 lakh and this constitutes over 10% of its annual income then it can be considered to be "substantially funded" for the purposes of the Right to Information (RTI) Act

**6.** NGOs and RTI

NGOs having the following characteristics should come under the purview of RTI:

- Substantially financed by government authorities.
- NGOs having natural monopoly, impinging on citizens lives.
- Any information, if it were held by government, subject to RTI disclosure, when transferred to NGO will continue to be subject to disclosure.
- **7.** National Coordination Committee (NCC) should be created and be headed by Central Information Commissioner – this committee will monitor the implementation of RTI.
- **8.** Application of RTI to legislature:
  - There should be a tracking mechanism so that action taken by executive branches on CAG reports and other enquiry commission reports is available to the public and legislators.
  - Working dynamics of Legislative Committees should be thrown open to the public.
- **9.** Application of RTI Act to Judiciary
  - Records at district court and subordinate courts should be stored in a scientific manner and uniform way.
  - Administrative processes in district and subordinate courts should be computerized in a time bound manner.
- **10.** Information provided by government departments are mystified and too technical. This should be addressed by providing information that will add value to the applicant.
- **11.** Maintenance of information is not automated and therefore not efficient. Proper IT infrastructure should be installed in order to record day to day actions of the concerned departments.
- **12.** Suo moto disclosure of information mandated under the Act is not being done properly.
- **13.** Awareness of the law is very low among masses. More and more publicity is required to educate the people regarding the law.
- **14.** Costs of accessing information through RTI are high.
- **15.** Official Secrets Act promotes a culture of secrecy, which acts as a deterrent to RTI. It should be judiciously applied, without hindering the scope of RTI.

- **16.** Officials need to be properly sensitized and trained with respect to transparency and accountability concerns of RTI.
- **17.** Other acts, rules, manuals have not been amended to make them congruent with the RTI spirit.
- **18.** RTI has not been able to create a climate of transparency as a norm. Rather RTI is being used to pet small work done or to threaten or harass.
- **19.** Right to privacy has not been provided under the Act.
- **20.** Bureaucratic pre-eminence in Information Commissions results in promotion of traditional bureaucratic ethos of secrecy and lack of accountability.
- **21.** Many High Courts have made rules exempting themselves from RTI.

# **Recommendations of Second Administrative Reforms**

- **1.** The Official Secrets Act, 1923 should be repealed, and substituted by a chapter in the National Security Act, containing provisions relating to official secrets.

# **Political Parties under Right to Information (RTI)**

Over the years and through its various judgments, the Supreme Court has consistently ruled in favour of the citizen's right to know. In State of UP vs Raj Narain (1975), the apex court declared that right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) included the right to know every public act, everything that is done in a public way and by their public functionaries.

In S.P. Gupta vs UOI and Anr (1981), the Supreme Court reiterated that right to know is implicit in right of free speech and expression, and disclosure of information regarding the functioning of the government must be the rule. In People's Union of Civil Liberties vs UOI (2004), the RTI was further elevated to the status of a human right, necessary for making governance transparent and accountable. It also emphasised that governance must be made participatory.

Political parties act as the vocal chords of the people, both within and outside the government. Through policy making and debates in legislatures, politicians voice the demands of citizens, acting as a liaison between the people and the government. In order to ensure that they truly serve the above purpose, it is necessary that they have a good level of transparency in their functioning. In the Indian political scenario, parties are scattered across various camps based on ideology, affiliation and several other divisions. However, it is quite strange to note that they stand united, when it comes to keeping their organizations away from eyes of RTI. In fact, the NDA government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi went to the extent of filing a counter-affidavit before the Supreme Court in 2015, saying that including political parties under the RTI would adversely affect their internal working and political functioning. As a contention, political parties say that they already exhibit a good level of transparency by filing their income tax returns and reporting on their donations to the Election Commission of India. However, it is to be noted that until the financial year 2016–17, these returns only included donations above `20,000.

Considering this, it is evident that national political parties have for long been resisting the RTI to conceal obscurities in their sources of funding. This has also proved how the existing laws have miserably failed in bringing complete transparency in the funding of political parties, creating the need for an overhaul in the mechanism for political funding.

The current pattern of funding, which shows the control and influence exerted by the big corporates and the business houses, pose an important question about the status of autonomy of the political parties in representing people and shaping up the policies, and RTI would help in exposing such links.

# **Judiciary under Right to Information (RTI)**

There are three substantial questions of law regarding RTI for Judiciary. These are as follows:

- **1.** Whether the independence of judiciary be affected by the information sought.
- **2.** Whether such disclosure of information would threaten the reliability of the decisions and expression of honest opinion by all the constitutional bodies.
- **3.** Whether non-disclosure is protected under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act.

There are indeed some valid and effective arguments for the judiciary to feel the need for secrecy. For example, collegium discussions can cover a lot of areas, which includes the discussion of courtroom corridor gossip and private life of the judges, the examination intelligence reports given by the government and the expression of personal opinions of the judges.

Though the Supreme Court lauds the RTI act and states that it is an "integral part of any vibrant democracy", but itself has refused to come under the ambit of the information transparency law for the past one decade. The court has firmly resisted back-to-back decisions of the Central Information Commission (CIC) and the Delhi High Court to open up to the RTI regime as far as the issues of Collegium and judicial appointments are concerned. In fact, the appeal filed by the Supreme Court against public disclosure under RTI has been pending in the Supreme Court since 2010. In August 2016, a three-judge Bench finally referred the appeal to a five-judge Constitution Bench. The question involved was whether disclosure of information under RTI about judicial appointments, transfers of Supreme Court judges, etc., would amount to interference in judicial independence. However, nothing further has been heard about the appeal. It seems to be stuck in time. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has recently started uploading its Collegium resolutions.

Credibility and reputation is hugely important especially for those who are occupying the highest seat of Judiciary, and many feel that even the slightest tarnish to this could be debilitating and prevent judges from doing their job.

And this is especially important in the case of Judges who are rejected by the collegium but still continue to serve in their respective posts in the High Courts. It is a legitimate fear among the Judges that few overenthusiastic advocates may dig the dirt on the Judges and take it out of context in order to have some leverage in the Courtroom, by asking for their recusal or otherwise, questioning their independence while hearing a case.

And ultimately, many judges are people too, and by tradition and necessity, deeply private ones at that.

Therefore, being completely subject to RTI is perhaps deeply uncomfortable to some of them at a deeper level.

So, can anything be done to solve this issue?

There is no one easy solution, and it is difficult to find one when there is a standoff between the Apex Court and the Government about reform of judicial appointments.

#### **NGOs under Right to Information (RTI)**

The definition of public authority under Section 2(h) of the Act is as follows:

'Public authority' means any authority or body or institution of self- government established or constituted:

- by or under the Constitution;
- by any other law made by the Parliament;
- by any other law made by a State Legislature;
- by notification issued or order made by the appropriate Government, and includes any:
  - **(i)** body owned, controlled or substantially financed;
  - **(ii)** non-Government organization substantially financed, directly or indirectly by funds provided by the appropriate Government;
  - **(iii)** NGO that is substantially financed, directly or indirectly by the government is under RTI review.

In Thalapalam Service Co-operative Bank Ltd. v. Union of India (2013), the Supreme Court clarified that:

- 'controlled': a control of substantial nature over the management and affairs of the body and not just mere supervisory or regulatory control.
- 'financed directly or indirectly': receiving grants-in-aid, governmental funds, benefits from government schemes (for land, etc.).

Any NGO that qualifies the above is under the purview of the RTI Act, 2005.

Comptroller and Audit General (CAG) Shashi Kant Sharma directed social audits on NGOs and panchayat bodies directly funded by the government, state information commission has ordered all state government-funded NGOs to come under the ambit of RTI Act.

The order states transparency and accountability should be maintained by NGOs which receive annual funding of `50,000 and above by government. NGOs must come under section 4 (1) (b) of RTI Act, 2005, which demands proactive disclosure of information by an organization.

#### **10 YEARS OF Right to Information (RTI)**

In 2015, the RTI act completed 10 years, though amidst mixed opinions evaluating its journey so far. On one hand, there is a sense of rejoice for its role in establishing citizens' right to seek information from public authorities. On the other hand, inaction on reforms needed for efficient implementation of the act have raised doubts over how far things have practically changed at the ground level. The reality of RTI act's implementation lay somewhere in the middle of these two standpoints. In its decade-long existence, the act has managed to bring transparency by exposing slew of corruption cases running into thousands of crores such as CWG, 2G and Adarsh society scam. But, accountability in the routine working of the public authorities is yet to take roots as majority of common citizens still find access to information difficult due to delays, supply of insufficient information and limited reach of the act.

# **Issues in the Existing Act's Implementation**

Citizen's participation in everyday governance entails supply of information in due time. According to a study, pendency of cases in 23 Information Commissions (ICs) across India is 1,98,7391. And, it takes at least a year for an appeal to come up for hearing before an IC. The resultant delay in accessing information undermines citizens' right to know and redress individual grievances, access entitlements such as ration cards and pensions, investigate government policies and decisions, and expose corruption. One of the main reasons for high pendency of appeals with ICs is ineffective process of information supply at the level of Public authorities (PAs) during first application and subsequent first appeal.

The information Seeker Survey found that '75% of the citizens are dissatisfied with the quality of the information provided by PAs'. Even the process of first appeal does not yield substantial result. Except for first appeals filed with the central government or Delhi government, there is less than 4% chance of getting any information by filing a first appeal. The reason behind such state of affairs is not only bureaucratic resistance to transparency but inefficient information collection and management system within government agencies. As the files and information are dispersed across several offices of one department for lack of digitisation of records, it becomes difficult to provide information completely and timely on the part of PAs.

Along with it, suppliers of information, the PIOs are not properly equipped or trained to handle the responsibility of supplying information. According to a study, 45% of the PIOs have not undergone any form of training related to the RTI act. Thus, lack of comprehensive capacity-building efforts make it difficult for them to process the bulky information held by government agencies into legible one sought by citizens. The IC report also observed that many cases may not have been brought up for adjudication if well-informed PIOs had resolved the issue earlier.

Lack of ownership of the act by state governments has also resulted in scarcity of financial resources for the functioning of the act. Union Government, on the recommendation of the 2nd Administrative Reform Commission had advised state governments to earmark 1% of the funds meant to implement major welfare schemes towards necessary reforms such as digitization of records and buying necessary infrastructure to provide information over a period of 5 years.

# **Steps to Improve Right to Information (RTI) Act**

# **Creation of RTI Implementation Cell by Appropriate Governments**

To ensure coordination between the appropriate Government and the Information Commission in discharging the duties mandated under the RTI Act, it is recommended that there should be an RTI Implementation Cell under the appropriate Government. This Cell should be under the leadership of a senior-level bureaucrat. This Cell is expected to set up implementation measures to promote compliance by the public authorities and oversee the status of implementation. The Chief CIC or Chief SIC may be an invitee in the meetings of the proposed Cell to help the appropriate Government in carrying out the responsibilities mandated under the Act.

# **Strengthening Implementation Set-up at Public Authority**

'RTI readiness Plan' needs to be prepared to assess the status of current preparedness and to plan for the next 3 years. On basis of this report, a project plan needs to be developed to identify basic activities, which should be carried out for effective implementation of the RTI Act; assess the quality of record keeping and ensure good standards of records management; • coordinate and arrange adequate training for required staff in the authority; and identify areas for proactive disclosure. It will have to ensure the proactive disclosure is updated and linked to the needs of the citizens; plan for proper infrastructure, systems and processes are developed for implementation of RTI.

# **Annual Self-Assessment by Nodal Departments**

It is suggested that the Centre/State Nodal Departments should carry out an annual self-assessment exercise. This self-assessment is to assess initiatives taken by the State Government towards implementation of the Act and also capture various outcomes. This exercise is intended to identify a comprehensive list of activities, which are needed to be taken by the Nodal Departments.

#### **Massive Awareness Campaign**

A massive awareness campaign is necessary to educate the citizens about the RTI Act and encourage citizen involvement. The awareness program must especially target the vulnerable categories of citizens such as:

- **(i)** women;
- **(ii)** farmers and rural families; and

**(iii)** middle and working class, for whom most of the social benefit schemes of the Government are targeted.

For this purpose, RTI awareness and education needs to be aggressively pursued using the appropriate medium of communication. Also adequate budget needs to be allocated by the appropriate Governments for this initiative. The main objectives of the campaign should be to (i) increase public knowledge and awareness; (ii) encourage citizen involvement and debate; and (iii) increase transparency within Government through informed citizenry.

#### **Alternative Channels for Submission of RTI Requests**

In order to facilitate citizens in filing RTI requests/appeals, the following alternate channels should be designated as APIOs (provided for under section 5(2)):

- Citizen Service Centres (CSCs) facilitating citizens in filing RTI applications
- Department of Posts to assist in drafting and forwarding the application/appeals
- RTI call centres
- RTI portal
- RTI resource centre in each district headquarter

**RTI Call Centre:** The RTI call centre could be a single nodal point used by citizens for filing RTI applications/appeals/complaints over the telephone. Additionally, it could also serve as a centralized database of all the RTI applications received and the respective responses. The call centre can be developed on the lines of the 'Jankari' RTI call centre in Bihar. Through this initiative, the citizens can file information requests under the RTI Act through telephonic channel.

#### **Creating Enabling Environment and Capacity Building**

Recommendations:

- **1.** Creation of a Knowledge Resource Centre.
- **2.** Capacity building for training.
- **3.** Making Record Keeping 'RTI Friendly'.
- **4.** Development of Web-based applications for PAs and Information Commissions.
- **5.** Improve Motivation of PIOs.
- **6.** Earmarking budget for implementing the recommendations.

# **Improving Efficiencies at Information Commission Recommendation**

Improving the disposal rate of complaints/appeals by information commission through following recommendations:

- Creation of more offices and using video conferencing for hearings.
- Passing order on merit of the case without hearing (to be used only when the order is in favour of appellant).
- Composition of Information Commissions.
- Induction Period for new Commissioners.
- Usage of Standard Templates for passing order.

## **Success Stories of Right to Information (RTI)**

## I. Children Empowering Through RTI

# *A. School Girl Gets Garbage Dump Cleared*

#### The Problem

Aishwarya is possibly the youngest RTI user. She was eight-year-old in 2009 and a class four student of Rajajipuram branch of Lucknow's renowned City Montessori School, when she successfully used RTI for a public cause. Aishwarya was distressed that she and her school mates had to walk to school, through an overflowing garbage dump that lay in front of the school. They were also vulnerable to the stray dogs which loitered around the dump. Earlier, several residents had appealed to the civic body to shift the garbage dump, but it fell on deaf ears.

#### Use of RTI

Aishwarya then consulted her mother who is an RTI user and wrote to the Chief Minister's Office on 26 October 2009, highlighting the danger that the garbage dump posed to the school children and requested action from the municipality to shift the garbage dump. She did not receive any reply. On 30 November 2009, she sent an application under Section 6 of the RTI Act to the Public Information Officers(PIO) at the office of the Chief Minister. The application was handwritten on her school notebook. She took out required money from her piggybank to pay the RTI application fees of `10.

In the application, Aishwarya sought information on the following points:

- Whether it was legally permissible to locate a garbage disposal site near a school. What was the land actually meant for?
- Who would be held responsible if the garbage dump became a source of infection for children in her school?

#### The Success

In February 2010, Aishwarya received a response from the Lucknow Municipal Corporation, informing her that the said site was reserved for a public library. Hence, the Mayor had directed that the site should be cleared. Soon, the garbage dump was gone and a public library with books, newspapers and magazines came up at the site.

# *B. Student Gets Road Repaired*

#### The Problem

T. K. Sreejeeth Vijay (Avre Palkaar Babu), a class eight student of Kamaraj English Medium School, PortBlair, Andaman Islands, was greatly inconvenienced by a road that needed repairs.

# Use of RTI

On the advice of his father, Vijay filed an RTI application to Port Blair Municipal Council (PBMC) as well as Andaman Public Works Department (APWD) on 16 November 2012. Since the location was not clear in his RTI application, he had to appear before the Assistant Engineer I (Water Works), PBMC on 6 December 2012. He explained the location of the road with the help of Google images and the photos taken from mobile phones showed the bad condition of the road. After giving the location details of the road, the applicant was informed that information will be sent shortly.

# The Success

The road repair work was taken up on top priority the very next day. Local newspaper reported, 'While PBMC started the repairing works of the said road, APWD forwarded the said RTI application to the concerned PIO to provide the information in time along with a reminder letter. Both the copies were also received by the young RTI user.' Vijay became the youngest RTI user in the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

# II. Bringing Transparency in Administration

# *A. The Fair Price Shop Becomes Really Fair*

# The Problem

Bhadresh Wamja was then a second year B.Com student from Saldi village, about 225 km from Gandhinagar, wondered why the two fair price shops in his village never seemed to have enough stocks of wheat, rice and kerosene. One day, when Bhadresh visited one of the shops, he was told by the shopkeeper that he had not been getting any stock of wheat, rice or kerosene from the government for the past several months. That prompted Bhadresh to use RTI 'in the larger interest of the village'.

# Use of RTI

By coincidence, a leading newspaper of Gujarat printed a chart showing the amount of food-grains and kerosene that families of Above Poverty Line (APL) and Below Poverty Line (BPL) should receive every month, along with a table giving the prices per kg. Bhadresh filed an RTI application to the *tehsildar* of Lilia Taluka on 11 February 2011, seeking information on supplies that his village's fair price shop has been receiving every month, between August 2010 and January 2011. The *tehsildar* ordered the shopkeeper to disclose the details within 15 days. The shopkeeper did not oblige. On advice of Pankti Jog, a member of the Mahiti Adhikar Gujarat Pahel (MAGP) in Ahmedabad, Bhadresh lodged a police complaint. He also visited the office of the District Supply Officer (DSO) where he found out that the shopkeeper was supplied with 8,306 kg of wheat as regular supply and 1,599 kg as extra wheat between August 2010 and January 2011. Records showed that the shopkeeper had supplied the entire stock to ration card holders. Random inspection by the *tehsildar* who visited Saldi, revealed that nine of the ten ration card holders had not received even a single kilogram of grain during the previous six months. He was forced to write a report against the shopkeeper, and the District Supply Officer ordered an inquiry.

# The Success

Bhadresh's campaign propelled the Chief Information Commissioner of Gujarat to send a letter on 17 February 2011, to the Secretary of the Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department, to order proactive disclosure of ration supplies not only at *tehsildar* offices, but also at fair price shops across the state. The Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department in an order, dated 4 March 2011, asked all tehsildars and fair price shop licensees in Gujarat to proactively disclose ration supply information on the walls of fair price shops, every week.

## *B. Reviving Ward Committee Meetings*

# The Problem

As per the provision under Section 29 A (1) of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949, forming Ward Committees and holding meetings on a regular basis is mandatory. The ward committee comprises corporator, the ward officer and a maximum number of three members from NGOs who are registered as voters in the ward. Meetings of such Ward Committees which are vital for citizen-government interface are required to be held at least once a month at the ward office. However, there were hardly any such meetings held, in any of the wards of the Jalgaon Municipal Corporation.

# Use of RTI

Deepak Gupta, an RTI user from Jalgaon, filed an RTI application on 11 February 2015, with the Jalgaon Municipal Corporation, seeking information on the number of Ward Committee meetings held in all the wards. He also brought this issue to the notice of the Municipal Commissioner and corporators.

#### The Success

The RTI reply revealed that, of the 75 corporators elected to the Municipal Corporation, only two had conducted meetings of Ward Committees. Subsequently, on 22 April 2016, the Municipal Corporation informed Gupta that after he brought it to the notice of municipal authorities, they have started organizing ward meetings. A similar problem persisted in the Amravati Municipal Corporation, which too was resolved after RTI was exercised. Now, civic problems are discussed regularly at Ward Committee meetings and solutions are suggested. These meetings have also helped improve communication between the local residents, civic administration and the concerned corporators.

#### III. Social Justice through RTI

#### *A. RTI helps Indira Awaas Yojana Beneficiaries*

#### The Problem

Indira Awaas Yojana (IAY) (now renamed as Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awaas Yojana), is a social welfare flagship programme, created by Government of India to provide housing for the rural poor. There was a problem with allotment of houses under the scheme in post for disbursal of grants under this scheme. In Kendrapara district with the alleged connivance of local politicians and government officers. The local block office and the Kendrapara District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) made the beneficiaries run from pillar to post fordisbursal of grants under this scheme.

Sukanta Dwivedy, a native from the interior pocket of Kendrapara district and Patkura Block area, was one of the aggrieved beneficiaries. In spite of spending `11000 and fighting against red-tapism, he was unable to get the list of beneficiaries.

#### Use of RTI

Sukanta Dwivedy filed an RTI application seeking details of the implementation of the Indira Awaas Yojana in all the 18 Gram *Panchayats* in Patkura Block. The information provided to him by the government authorities revealed that government funds had not reached the Below Poverty Line (BPL) people for whom they were meant. In Patkura *Panchayat*, 747 BPL families, were entitled for housing grants. Under Indira Awaas Yojana, grants were given to 1155 families. Still, 189 genuine BPL families were deprived as the grants were released to Above Poverty Line (APL) families.

#### The Success

The documents obtained through the RTI were adequate to prove the embezzlement in the court of law. An inquiry was subsequently ordered and allotment of 1800 houses was besides the BDO, Patkura, were suspended.

#### *B. Fraudulent NGO Exposed*

#### The Problem

An advertisement for appointment for various posts was published in the Ranchi (Jharkhand) edition of Dainik Bhaskar, a Hindi Daily, on 14 February 2016. The title of this advertisement was Gramin Khadya Yojana (Rural Food Scheme) and it was claimed to be registered by the Government of India. Applications for appointment of District and Block Coordinators were invited and the salaries mentioned were very lucrative. Applications for appointing dealers at *Panchayat* level were also invited in the same advertisement. This was for a so-called scheme named as Amrit Centre (Food Distribution Centre). It was claimed that daily consumable goods would be provided to the rural population of Jharkhand at a very cheap rate. Its Head Office was shown to be at Ranchi and the Zonal Office at Dhanbad.

#### Use of RTI

Vishnu Rajgadia and Amit Kumar Jha, associated with Jharkhand Foundation had earlier some bitter experience of fraud NGOs engaged in cheating people in the name of job or other opportunities. Amit filed an RTI application at the office of the Public Information Officer of District Supply Office, Ranchi on 18 February 2016. He sought information on details of this scheme along with copies of the correspondence with the government by this NGO, if any. He requested details regarding providing food items to the common people at a cheap rate. He also sought the copy of the rules to check if any organization can invite applications for appointment on behalf of any government scheme.

#### The Success

The Public Information Officer at District Supply Office, Ranchi, provided the information on 27 February 2016, stating that the concerned NGO had never contacted the administration regarding such a scheme nor had the government issued any directive regarding the same. He further clarified that there was no provision for such a scheme. The district administration, in consultation with the legal department, took action against the officials of the NGO, that led to closing down the activities of the NGO.

# IV. Women Empowerment Through RTI

# *A. Empowering Women Self Help Groups*

#### The Problem

Members of women Self-Help Groups (SHG) in Chennai wanted to increase the spectrum of SHGs to facilitate their reach-out to a maximum number of families. They also wanted access to more information about the government schemes and SHG support programme schemes so that they could scale up their activities.

# Use of RTI

Self-Help Group members were sensitized about the provisions of the RTI Act, 2005 as a part of the capacity building and training initiative. Out of 10,000 women SHG members across the State, 300 members from every district, were provided training on RTI over a period of two years. As a result, awareness about RTI increased considerably throughout the State.

# The Success

By the end of 2014, SHG members had started using RTI to procure the required information. This helped to further the activities of the SHGs as they became aware of different schemes and funding patterns. They also found it easy to use RTI to access information from the public authorities as the PIOs were cooperative. Thus, they became happy beneficiaries of schemes of which they were unaware earlier. This along with other factors gave a major boost to the SHG movement. As a result, the number of SHGs and the number of SHG members increased substantially.

# *B. Kamla Gets Finance for her House*

#### The Problem

Kamla Moirangthiem is a resident of Uchekontakhok village of Manipur. In 2006, her village Pradhan had taken her details for the Indira Awaas Yojana (IAY). However, only three applications were approved and she did not know whether she had made it to the list of beneficiaries.

# Use of RTI

Kamla's friend filed an RTI application, seeking information of the list of beneficiaries under the IAY scheme. The information revealed that Kamla was selected as one of the beneficiaries. When Kamla approached the Pradhan of her Gram Panchayat with a request for money for her house, he asked her to submit two photographs along with her signature on a blank sheet. When Kamla asked what he planned to write on the blank sheet signed by her, he did not give any reply. When she asked him the amount that she would be paid, he told her that, after deducting a percentage for the insurgent groups, she would be given `18,000 to build a house. Knowing that she was entitled to `35,000, Kamla refused to sign the paper.

She then filed a complaint with the District Collector but no action was taken, upon which she filed a writ petition in the Guwahati High Court, Imphal bench in 2009. The high court directed the administration to take appropriate action on her complaint.

#### The Success

The District Collector responded on 11 May 2009 and directed the Block Development Officer to release the payment. Finally, Kamla got her money in two instalments. She became the first person to get the entire amount not only in her village but also in nearby areas. Now, people look up to her and promise her that they too would fight for their entire money that they are entitled for, under the Indira Awaas Yojana.

Kamla and her friends are a part of a group that has been trained in the effective use of RTI Act by Macha Leima, a women's organization. It is one of the oldest women's organizations in Manipur. After the implementation of RTI Act, Macha Manipur and trained them to use the RTI Act.

# V. RTI Benefitting the Elderly

# *A. Pension Disbursed in 30 days*

# The Problem

As per the Employees' Pension Scheme 1995, a member who has not attained age of 50 years but has left the Provident Fund membership is issued the Scheme Certificate by Employees' Provident Fund Organization (EPFO). Such a certificate is required to be submitted in original along with the pension claim form for settlement of monthly pension. Reba (Mitra) Sinha submitted her application for monthly pension along with the original Scheme Certificate of her Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) Account in February 2011. However, the original Scheme Certificate was later found missing in the office of the EPFO and her claim could not be processed.

On 3 November 2011, the Assistant Provident Fund Commissioner, Regional Office, Kolkata wrote to her asking to resubmit her application for monthly pension along with the necessary documents. This was done. Thereafter, Reba Sinha visited the office of the Assessing Officer on several occasions in 2013, 2014 and 2015 requesting him to release the pension but to no avail. The officer then verbally intimated her that her original certificate had been returned via post but she never received such a letter.

#### 378 **Governance in India**

#### Use of RTI

On 16 November 2015, Reba (Mitra) Sinha filed an RTI application with the C.P.I.O. Regional Provident Fund Commissioner, West Bengal, seeking the information about various details of her application with original certificate and its status.

It was revealed that her original scheme certificate which was essential for settlement of monthly pension was not submitted by the officer as it was apparently misplaced. A photocopy of the original scheme certificate was made available to the applicant and a note was initiated for accepting the photocopy of the scheme certificate since the identity of the claimant had been proved. The Assistant Commissioner accepted the request and processed for settlement of the pension claim.

#### The Success

On receipt of the RTI application, the competent authority took proactive care to settle the pension and the monthly pension order was finally issued. Thus, Reba started getting her pension within 30 days of her RTI application.

#### *B. Taking up the failed ATM transaction*

#### The Problem

On 18 October 2009, an ATM withdrawal of `1000 made by a Pune-based senior citizen and entrepreneur Sharad Phadke, failed. He tried once again and this time he was successful. However, the initial failed transaction was also debited from his account in Bank of India. Which meant that `2000 was debited instead of `1000.

On the same day, he lodged an online complaint with Bank of India, but there was no response. He came across a circular dated 17 July 2009 issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under section 18 of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. It stated that the RBI has made it mandatory for all banks to restore failed transaction amount of the customer within 12 days of lodging the complaint or pay the penalty of `100 per day to him. (Subsequently, RBI has reduced it to seven days instead of 12 days).

After Phadke lodged several complaints to Bank of India, Laxmi Road branch, an amount of `1000 was credited to his account on 7 February 2010 but replies about compensation of `100 per day for the 65 days delay by the Bank of India, were evasive.

#### Use of RTI

Phadke then filed an RTI application at the Bank of India's head office, in Mumbai, on 7 February asking for information about reasons for not crediting compensation money to his account on the day `1000 was credited back to him and information regarding the name and designation of the officer, responsible for this act.

#### The Success

Within three weeks of lodging the RTI application, the compensation amount of `6500 was credited to Phadke's account. He pursued the campaign further by invoking RTI to find out the detailed data of similar cases in various banks and found, much to his horror, that it amounted to a large amount of money. He also began making requests for inspection of files.

Phadke then filed an appeal to the first appellate authority as well as Central Information Commission (CIC), as Pune's Laxmi Road branch of Bank of India was not permitting him to inspect files pertaining to the ATM compensation issue.

On 4 November 2010, the CIC directed the PIO of Bank of India (Headquarters) in Mumbai 'to assemble all records and documents, circulars and guidelines relating to the proactive disclosures at the Laxmi Road Branch and to invite Phadke to inspect them on any mutually convenient day within five working days from receipt of the order.' The replies showed that instances of failed ATM transactions and banks not paying compensation were not rare.

Phadke also made an RTI application to the RBI asking for copies of quarterly reports of ATM transactions submitted by banks and the action taken against defaulting banks. Phadke passed away in 2015 but he has paved the way for hundreds of harassed customers who can now take the RTI route and get their wrongly debited amount back.

#### **Official Secrets Act**

#### **Q. What is the Act about?**

**Ans.**The Official Secrets Act (OSA) was first enacted in 1923 and was retained after Independence. The law, applicable to government servants and citizens, provides the framework for dealing with espionage, sedition, and other potential threats to the integrity of the nation. The law makes spying, sharing 'secret' information, unauthorized use of uniforms, withholding information, interference with the armed forces in prohibited/restricted areas, among others, punishable offences. If guilty, a person may get up to 14 years' imprisonment, a fine, or both.

The information could be any reference to a place belonging to or occupied by the government, documents, photographs, sketches, maps, plans, models, official codes or passwords.

#### **Q. Has the law undergone any changes over the years?**

**Ans.** No. However, the Second Administrative Reforms Commission (SARC) Report, 2006, suggested that the Act should be substituted by a chapter in the National Security Act that incorporates the necessary provisions. The reason: it had become a contentious issue after the implementation of the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

The OSA does not define 'secret' or 'official secrets'. Public servants could deny any information terming it a 'secret' when asked under the RTI Act.

The SARC report stated that as the OSA's background is the colonial climate of mistrust of people and the primacy of public officials in dealing with the citizens, it created a culture of secrecy. 'Confidentiality became the norm and disclosure the exception,' it said. This tendency was challenged when the Right to Information Act came into existence.

In 2008, during the first term of the UPA, the Group of Ministers that scrutinized the SARC report refused to repeal the Act but suggested amendments to do away with ambiguities. Even on Thursday, Congress President Rahul Gandhi was wary of scrapping the law. He was of the view that the legislation should not be used to harass journalists.

In 2015, the National Defence Academy(NDA) government formed a high-level panel to look into the provisions of the OSA in the light of the RTI Act. No action has been taken on the panel's report, which was submitted in 2017.

#### **Is withholding information the only issue with the Act?**

**Ans.** Another contentious issue with the law is that its Section 5, which deals with potential breaches of national security, is often misinterpreted. The section makes it a punishable offence to share information that may help an enemy state. The section comes in handy for booking journalists when they publicize information that may cause embarrassment to the government or the armed forces.

Journalist Tarakant Dwivedi alias Akela was booked for criminal trespass under the Official Secrets Act on 17 May 2011, 11 months after he wrote an article in *Mid-Day* about how sophisticated weapons bought after 26/11 were being stored in a room with a leaking roof at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus in Mumbai. An RTI query later revealed that the armoury Akela visited was not a prohibited area and the Bombay High Court subsequently dismissed the case.

Kashmir-based journalist Iftikhar Gilani was arrested in 2002 under the OSA for downloading a document from the Internet. After spending seven months in jail, he was honourably discharged by the courts.

In a case pertaining to journalist Santanu Saikia, who wrote an article in *Financial Express* on the basis of a leaked Cabinet note, the Delhi High Court in 2009 ruled that publishing a document merely labelled as 'secret' shall not render the journalist liable under the OSA.

#### **Do other nations have similar laws?**

**Ans.** Several countries, including the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Singapore, and New Zealand, continue to use the legislation to protect state secrets. In 2001, Canada replaced its OSA with a Security of Information Act. The 'official secrets' come under the Espionage Act in the US.

On 3 September 2018, a Myanmar court awarded seven years' jail to two Reuters journalists for illegally possessing official documents on the military's alleged human rights abuses against Rohingya Muslims. Malaysia has also been accused of using the OSA to silence dissidence.

# **Conclusion**

RTI is a landmark legislation as it was enacted after a sustained demand and struggle from the grassroots level. It empowers ordinary citizens to question government accustomed to function in unbreachable secrecy. Where people and activists have been able to make use of RTI, results have been rewarding—from uncovering human rights violations in Hashimpura, to bringing transparency in IIT-JEE entrance exams and making MNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee act)-related information public.

Yet, a lot remains to be done to make transparency and accountability a regular feature of governance in India. The urban–rural divide in its access contradicts its foremost objective of bringing information and thus, empowerment to the masses at grassroots level. The lack of reforms denies citizens the opportunity to make governance people-centric. Given that the weakness of the RTI lies in its weak implementation, the next phase of RTI act needs to focus on increasing the authority of implementing agencies, especially SICs, of the act in order to set in motion the practical regime of RTI by ensuring much needed compliance from government agencies.
