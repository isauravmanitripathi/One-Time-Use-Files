#### INTRODUCTION

According to the World Bank, 'E-Governance refers to the use by government agencies of information technologies (viz., wide area networks, the Internet, and mobile computing) that have the ability to transform relations with citizens, businesses and other arms of government. These technologies can serve a variety of different ends: better delivery of government services to citizens, improved interactions with business and industry, citizen empowerment through access to information or more efficient government management. The resulting benefits can be less corruption, increased transparency, greater convenience, revenue growth and/or cost reductions'.

#### e-Governance as per UNESCO

Governance refers to the exercise of political, economic and administrative authority in the management of a country's affairs, including citizens.

#### TYPES OF INTERACTIONS IN E-GOVERNANCE

As per the second administrative reforms committee's report, e-Governance facilitates interaction between different stakeholders in governance. It states that there are four types of interactions in e-Governance as follows:

- (i) Government to citizens  $(G2C)$
- (ii) Government to business (G2B)
- (iii) Government to government (G2G)
- (iv) Government to employees  $(G2E)$

These interactions may be described as follows:

**G2G (Government to Government):** With this mode of interaction, besides restructuring the governmental processes involved, information technology and communication (IT&C) helps in improving the flow of information and services within and between the different stakeholders involved, such as, departments within and across ministries. The interaction can happen in both horizontal and vertical directions. The key objective and outcome of e-Governance in this relationship is the need to increase efficiency, performance and productivity.

**G2C (Government to Citizens):** The purpose of any initiative that would improve governance will result in better delivery of services to citizens. In this respect, e-Governance enables the creation of a digital liaison between the government and citizens. This will enable the latter to benefit from efficient delivery of a wide range of public services. In addition to expanding the availability and accessibility, e-Governance also improves the quality of services as well. It seeks to make the government citizenfriendly. Additionally, it also raises the credibility of government in the minds of people.

Through e-Governance, citizens have several advantages as follows:

- **a.** They can access services round-the-clock over the Internet.
- **b.** They have a variety of access points, such as common service centres, e-kiosks or from their home/workplace.

**G2B (Government to Business):** The ease of doing business is a critical element in the healthy development of a country. For this purpose, it becomes imperative that the government–business interactions are maintained in a seamless manner. Reduction of red tape, time consumption, operational costs and the need for transparency are the most essential requirements to enable a competitive and congenial business environment. Transactional interactions, such as licensing, permits, procurement and revenue collection, etc., can be accelerated through the deployment of e-Governance initiatives. Such measures are sure to aid businesses to perform better and expand their operations.

**G2E (Government to Employees):** Every government depends highly on its workforce. Thus, it is vitally important to interact with its employees on a regular basis. This interaction has to happen on a two-way basis. On one hand, the government can send its circulars, notifications and memoranda to its employees across departments, with the push of a button. Similarly, by using IT&C tools, the government can also get to know and address the needs and concerns of its employees, on a faster and efficient manner, thereby satisfying them, which will lead to a much better functioning of the government machinery.

## **E-Governance Brings SMART Governance**

The purpose of implementing e-Governance is to raise the level of performance and ensure the proper delivery of services to all who deserve them. This will be possible through five main characteristics of e-Governance SMART system.

#### **S Implies Simple**

What was carried out through several forms and documents would now be reduced and simplified with the help of IT&C tools. Through e-Governance, citizens will feel more comfortable to approach the government authorities to avail their services.

## **M Implies Moral**

The entry of a novel system will instil a new system of ethical values in the administrative machinery. Through the implementation of technology, the scope for mismanagement or corruption could be greatly reduced.

#### **A Implies Accountable**

By imparting a robust framework in the management of information and processes, the performance at both individual and departmental levels can be effectively monitored. This results in a sense of accountability among the functionaries concerned.

## **R Implies Responsive**

The streamlining of service delivery makes the system more responsive.

## **T Implies Transparent**

Information that was until now confined to archives of the government department will now be available in the public domain through e-Governance. This will ensure transparency and will practically lessen the threshold for corruption.

## **Benefits of e-Governance**

- **1.** Citizens will be able to access information easily and can receive a higher quality of service.
- **2.** E-governance would bring in timely and reliable information on the different aspects of governance and administrative actions.
- **3.** It helps in reducing time, effort and money by automating processes and establishing online accessibility of public services. By bringing in short turnaround times, the organization and its processes can be controlled and managed much more effectively.
- **4.** It helps in the simplification and rationalization of processes, which leads to efficient and accountable governance.
- **5.** It provides an interface for the people to interact with the government. Such measures that enable participation will reinforce the faith of the people in democracy.
- **6.** E-governance can provide effective solutions to end red tape, unwarranted delay, etc., by using modern tools, techniques and instruments of e-Governance.
- **7.** E-governance assists in reaching out to the corners of the country, even to places where it is physically impossible to reach in person.
- **8.** By following a 'citizen-first policy', e-Governance empowers them.
- **9.** It will open up innovative methods in service delivery.
- **10.** Within the governmental departments, it will help in:
  - **a.** avoiding duplication
  - **b.** reduction of transaction costs
  - **c.** simplify procedures
  - **d.** better communication and coordination
  - **e.** secure information management

Benefits of E-Governance

## **Limitations of e-Governance**

- **1.** At present, there is no institutional agency to oversee the speedy and effective implementation of the scheme.
- **2.** There is a lack of universal e-Governance architecture at the national level, which could cause problems in the universal implementation of certain central-sector schemes among two or more states at the same time.
- **3.** Integration of sections of users and institutions becomes difficult, when there is no common model.
- **4.** Adequate training to officials is a must, while introducing any new system in governance. A lack in this domain will result in an incomplete effort, thereby defeating the purpose of the process.
- **5.** E-governance initiatives are not receiving a warm welcome from the employees of government organizations.
- **6.** Most of the time, e-Governance initiatives are done with a process-centric mind set instead of a citizencentric approach.
- **7.** In countries such as India, there is a limited penetration of electronic communication. A sizable proportion of the population is yet to get access to computers or electronic gadgets in their villages and towns. Mere setting up of service centres in these areas would help little towards making it a success. Also the very knowledge base for accepting this new system of governance has not been prepared. People know little about how electronic devices work and would certainly feel difficult to adapt to the new system.

- **8.** Proper e-Governance functioning requires a complete revamp of the conventional process. Retrofitting technological devices to existing workflows alone would entail inefficient output.
- **9.** The limited Internet connectivity at present means that a large section of the population will not be able to access public services.
- **10.** Resources are scarce and unavailable at right time.

#### **Recent e-Governance Initiatives**

#### **1. Computerisation of Land Records (Department of Land Resources, Government of India)**

A Conference of the Revenue Ministers of States/UTs had advocated such computerization as early as in 1985. Based on the recommendation, the Union Ministry of Rural Development selected eight districts in eight states for a pilot project on Computerization of Land Records, which was 100% centrally-sponsored. From 1994 to 1995 and afterwards, it was implemented in collaboration with the NIC.

The main objectives of the scheme were as follows:

- **(i)** Ensuring that landowners get computerized copies of ownership, crop and tenancy and updated copies of Records of Rights (RoRs) on demand.
- **(ii)** Realizing low-cost and easily-reproducible basic land record data through reliable and durable preservation of old records.
- **(iii)** Ensuring accuracy, transparency and speedy dispute resolution.
- **(iv)** Facilitating fast and efficient retrieval of information for decision making.
- **(v)** According legal sanctity to computer-generated certificates of land records after authentication by the authorized revenue official.
- **(vi)** Setting up a comprehensive land information system for better land-based planning and utilization of land resources.
- **(vii)**Focusing on citizen-centric services related to land and revenue administration.

Due to the unsatisfactory implementation of the scheme, the Union Ministry for Rural Development constituted a Committee to suggest practical steps to implement the scheme. The Committee on Computerisation of Land Records submitted its Report in April 2005.

This Report suggested that the following:

 **(i)** In addition to computerizing Records of Rights, all States must computerize the details of crops, cultivation, soil classification, irrigation, etc. Scanning of basic land records and digitization of cadastral maps/ village maps may also be taken up under the Scheme of CLR.

- **(ii)** Village/cadastral maps/tippan should be digitized under the scheme of CLR for integration, updation and preservation of maps, which will enable a landowner to get a computerized copy of the Records of Rights along with plot boundaries. Due to variations in the system of maintenance of cadastral map, states may adopt the strategy suitable to their requirements. However, priority for digitization should be given to those districts, which have successfully completed computerisation of textual land records.
- **(iii)** Integration of computerisation of land records and computerisation of land registration should be initiated at the earliest on pilot basis in some States without waiting for amendments suggested in the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908.

Funds for setting up of computer centre in the office of the Sub-Registrar may be given under the scheme of CLR equivalent to funds provided to subdivisions. (The Committee also suggested making amendments to the Registration Act, 1908, to simplify registration and its integration with the land records).

- **(iv)** There should be a time frame for the implementation of this scheme.
- **(v)** According legal sanctity to computer-generated certificates of land records after authentication by the authorized revenue official.
- **(vi)** Setting up a comprehensive land information system for better land-based planning and utilization of land resources.
- **(vii)** Focusing on citizen-centric services related to land and revenue administration.

#### **Lessons**:

 **(i)** The scheme failed to address the main problem in case of land records in India, that is, the land records do not reflect the factual ground reality.

Computerisation of existing land records without corroborating it with the actual field position only led to perpetuation of existing loopholes and errors.

**(ii)** Complex e-Governance projects have various components all of which need to be implemented for which a holistic approach is needed during implementation.

### **2. Admission to Professional Colleges—Common Entrance Test**

With the rapid growth in the demand as well as supply of professional education, the process of admission to these institutions became a major challenge in the early 1990s. Recourse was then taken to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to make the process of admission transparent and objective. One of the pioneering efforts was made by Karnataka. The State Government decided to conduct a common entrance test (CET) based on which admission to different colleges and disciplines was made. The allocation of seats in different colleges/disciplines is done through a process of 'computerized counselling' where the student can choose the discipline he/she wants, based of course on merit. Use of ICT in the admission process has helped in making the admission process totally transparent, fair and objective. Many institutions have now switched over to similar ICT-based admission process.

#### **Lesson:**

**(i)** ICT initiatives which bring tangible benefits to citizens are always sustainable.

## **3. Digital India**

Digital India scheme which intends to transcend India into a digital economy has the following features:

## **Factors Required for Success of e-Governance**

#### (a) Adequate Infrastructure

For reaching the benefits of e-Governance, more e-Governance projects have to be implemented by building adequate e-infrastructure particularly in rural and backward regions. Dependence on ICT has increased compared to other instruments of service delivery for the obvious reasons of cost effectiveness, equity, participation and increased responsiveness and accountability of the service providers. As dependence has increased, we need to have 'e-readiness' for promoting effective e-Governance.

World Economic Forum Consultation Report on e-readiness defines as the ability of the ICT networks to effectively adopt itself to the social and economic advancement can be achieved through building adequate e-infrastructure, bringing awareness among the leaders of government, civil society and market organizations. By building adequate e-infrastructure and initiating more rural-centric e-Governance projects keeping in mind the requirements of the larger section of the population, e-Governance can be promoted more effectively in India.

#### (b) Sound Policy and Legal Framework

New regulations and laws are essential with regard to the application of ICT in promoting governance to ensure accountability and supply of quality goods and services by the private and public sectors without harming the larger society. Removal of obsolete laws and discretionary powers, simplification of procedures to avoid administrative bottlenecks and constitution of single windows ensure speedy disposal of cases. For the successful application of electronic governance, a range of legislative regulations is required covering the aspects of electronic signatures, electronic archiving, data matching, freedom of information, data protection, computer crime and intellectual property rights. Already the Government of India has IT Act and Convergence Bill. The following policy and legal initiatives are to be taken for strengthening e-Governance in India.

- **(i)** Accountability law for making public servants accountable and responsive for non-performance and malfunctioning of their departments
- **(ii)** Law for privacy ensuring that the information about the citizen is not misused
- **(iii)** A law in the line with the US Government Paper Elimination Act (GPEA) to promote use of electronic media

- **(iv)** Amendments to Consumers Protection Law, Tariffs and Taxation Laws, Intellectual Property Regulations, etc., are required
- **(v)** Preparing guidelines for content, technological standards, electronic payments
- **(vi)** Setting standards for electronic publishing, archiving, e-mails, etc.

#### (c) Socially Relevant Technologies and Integrated Management

Lack of peoples' participation, fractured relationship between government agencies and citizens, lack of availability of local resources, limited integration with local Civil Society Organizations (CSO) and exogenous social and economic environment are the reasons which failed ICT to deliver the full range of services in governance matters.

Updating of data in local languages, standardization in all areas, such as encoding, application logic for common applications, user interfaces, preparing data dictionaries, making appropriate cyber laws, procedural and legal changes in the decision and delivery making processes as well as in the institutions, encouraging private–public partnerships can facilitate the successful application of the e-Governance projects in India.

Efforts are needed to incorporate local languages and local content in Internet in a massive way. Accessing Internet using keyboard may limit the use of Internet. So there is a need of developing voice-enabled Internet service with Indian languages, and applications should emerge out of India way of life.

#### (d) Public–Private Partnership

It is a fact that India needs huge amount of fund for the implementation of e-Governance projects. The governments do not have such huge amount of funds. In this regard, encouraging private investment seems to be the possible answer. Public Private Partnership (PPP) model can be encouraged to initiate the projects in order to meet the needs of the rising population. The Gujarat check post Project is an example of PPP model for promoting e-Governance in India.

#### (e) Political and Administrative Leadership

State governments with committed political and administrative leadership are mainly responsible for promoting e-governance in some states in spite of poor communication infrastructure facilities. State governments like Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka under the leadership of Chandrababu Naidu (in Andhra Pradesh) and S. M. Krishna, respectively, have taken major initiatives in popularizing e-Governance in the improving the quality of administration. They were able to overcome many barriers in implementation of e-Governance projects through a focussed and strategic approach aiming specified targets and allowing reasonable time frame for attaining them. Specialized agencies have also come up within government to initiate innovative experiments. It is sometimes argued that given the low level of development of communication infrastructure in most Indian stats, the prospects of E-governance is bleak. Even in situations where the initial conditions for trying out e-Governance appear to be non-existent in terms of inadequate skilled personnel or weak infrastructure, a gradual, flexible and reflective approach can bring about drastic positive changes.

#### (f) Role of Civil Society

The Civil society bodies like citizens groups, associations and social activists are playing an active role in extending ICT for the empowerment of citizens and effective delivery. In a project of Cyber Grameen, a non-profit organization set up by Krishna Prasad Tripuraneni, a telecom entrepreneur in Chennai, wireless technology is used to offer digital entertainment, distance learning, tele-medicine and government services. NGOs are also making officials responsive and accountable through e-Governance projects. The Online Complaint Monitoring System (OCMS) in Mumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) with the active involvement of an NGO, named Praja Foundation, to redress citizens grievances, can be mentioned in this regard. It enables the citizens to register complaints and receive information on the complaint status quickly and easily, without the need to visit or call the ward offices at restricted timings.

Scholars attribute the ineffective utilization of installed ITC potential to the absence of links with the civil society. And its participation in e-Governance projects initiated by the governments is, however, not encouraging. Civil society and its representatives have been kept out in most of the programmes. Even in cases where such participation is sought, the linkages are either weak or notional. The CARD experience of Andhra Pradesh suggests that until and unless civil society bodies are active in the delivery of services, the situation will not improve.

#### (g) Human Resources Development and Capacity Building

Non-availability of proper human resources and lack of appropriate strategy are some of the roadblocks in the path of using ICT in the governance purposes. The fragmented approach in implementing the e-Governance programmes and computerization has led to excessive expenditure without delivering desired results. ICT has failed to promote desired results in facilitating governance because of organizational technical and human reasons. Information systems are not technical systems, rather these are social systems and there is a need to emphasize at the operational level in their social perspective. Some studies point out that the official mismanagement, lack of favourable attitude and orientation on the part of the officials hinder the progress of the application of e-Governance in India. Some projects were not effectively managed due to the lack of skills and motivations among the administrative staff.

Training for imparting skills (computer operation and content assessment) and including motivation among the officials are very essential for the effective utilization of ICT in governance. For instance, senior officers in Andhra Pradesh were trained in the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmadabad, for 4 months in hardware, software and special problems related to implementation of IT in government deportments with practical orientation. The government has been investing more than `2,50,000 to train each functionary. It spent `70 million on a 4.5 month training programme designed by the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmadabad, to train 20 officers to function as chief information officers. The programme covered a wide array of interdisciplinary topics, such as technology assessment, process re-engineering, change management, information analysis and project management. The programme was offered as a sandwich of classroom training alternated with hands-on project work. Similar training programme should be undertaken for capacity building of the bureaucrats for better application of ICT in service delivery.

#### **Steps Needed to Be Taken**

Going with the information given above, we can infer that e-Governance has a huge potential to promote efficient, prompt, responsive, citizen-friendly services to the people. It is cost-effective and has the potential to serve citizens at their doorsteps. Most importantly, it can be used as a tool to minimize corruption. While it is certain that people have to be trained to use the respective interfaces when implemented, it will help in the long run in avoiding long queues at government offices and secretariats. The very characteristic of digitization ensures limited scope to deny or delay services by the concerned service providers.

 **(i)** Public–private partnership can be forged to address fund constraints. This will help in funding the required e-infrastructure and training for government officers across the country.

**(ii)** Proper orientation training to the officials have to be provided through seminars, conferences, workshops, etc. This should be followed up with proper legislation on electronic governance, maintaining the required e-readiness, awareness programs targeting the general public, etc.

When the required ecosystem is created as above, it will be helpful in assessing the effectiveness of e-Governance in terms the level of interactions between government and citizens. This could be done by calculating the percent of citizens reached, the turn-around time for delivery of services, costs incurred for providing services, availability of services, citizen satisfaction, etc.

The following parameters are a must while delivering services through IT and e-Governance:

- **1.** Swift response by civil servants to queries
- **2.** Improved communication between the officials and beneficiaries
- **3.** Online accessibility to administrative structure, chart, form
- **4.** Online accessibility to reports and documents of the government
- **5.** Provisions for the people to share opinions on legislation and budgeting
- **6.** Online accessibility of government's budgets and expenditure reports
- **7.** Delivering services to a larger proportion of the population
- **8.** Improved responsiveness, accountability and transparency in the administrative institutions
- **9.** Availability of online applications for recruitments
- **10.** Online process of tendering, procurement, open to public access
- **11.** Availability of electronic documentation and record keeping
- **12.** Availability of online redressal of grievances through e-Ombudsman

Government officials have to be sensitized about the challenges posed by socioeconomic development. E-Governance can impact civil service in a positive way, and it may lead to excellence in the delivery of basic and essential services. That said, the primary issue that needs attention is the development of a system that is clear, transparent, responsive and sensitive to the socioeconomic conditions of the public.

It would surely reduce the amount of time spent in addressing requests, thereby reducing red-tapism. While being cost-effective, it makes the delivery of public services quicker and efficient by introducing competition amongst delivery channels and departments.

With respect to the attitude among people to use e-Governance services, efforts should be taken to make e-channels accessible and visible, with proper training and demonstration. In fact, not all services need to be made electronic from day one. Gradual introduction of e-Governance in certain areas will help in people getting attuned to the systems easily.

## **AADHAAR—INTERPRETATION BY THE SUPREME COURT**

#### **Background**

In 2010, the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the then Congress President Sonia Gandhi launched the Aadhaar programme. During the launch, Sonia Gandhi hailed the project as part of the vision of Rajiv Gandhi and that it was aimed at bringing inclusive growth. One thousand villagers in a tiny place called Tembhali in Maharashtra were the first ones to get the Aadhaar card. The project was launched with much fanfare and the entire village got a complete makeover.

After the National Defence Academy (NDA) came to power in 2014, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed the progress of the Aadhaar project and sought to know whether the platform can be used for Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) of subsidized schemes.

In March 2016, the government introduced the Aadhaar Bill as a Money Bill in the Parliament. The Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha, but got stuck in the Rajya Sabha which was controlled by the opposition. The Bill was passed with five amendments and returned to the Lok Sabha. These changes were refused by the government and the Bill was deemed to be passed.

Speaking on the matter, Arun Jaitley reiterated that privacy was not an 'absolute' right.

#### **Aadhar Act, 2016**

- **Context:** Legislation to provide statutory backing to Aadhaar is listed for introduction in Lok Sabha.
- **Type:** Money Bill
- **Name:** The Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016.

- **Provides for:** Good governance, efficient, transparent, and targeted delivery of subsidies, benefits and services to individuals residing in India through assigning of unique identity numbers to such individuals.
- **Expenditure:** For these is incurred from the Consolidated Fund of India.
- **Privacy concerns:** Will be adequately addressed, these have been one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the universal acceptance of Aadhaar.

## **Salient features of The Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016**

Enrolment

- Every resident shall be entitled to obtain an Aadhaar number by submitting his demographic information and biometric information during enrolment.

- The authority shall develop the policy, procedure and systems for issuing Aadhaar numbers to individuals and perform authentication thereof.

## **Protection of Information**

- No core biometric information (iris and fingerprints) shall be shared with anyone for any reason whatsoever and the same shall not be used for any purpose other than Aadhaar generation and authentication.
- Identity information of a resident shall not be used for any purpose other than specified at the time of authentication and not disclosed further except with the prior consent of the concerned Aadhaar holder.
- No Aadhaar number or core biometric information collected or created under this Act in respect of an Aadhaar number holder shall be published, displayed or posted publicly except for the purposes as may be specified by regulations.
- Every Aadhaar number holder shall be entitled to obtain his authentication records.
- The authority shall not collect, keep or maintain any information about the purpose of authentication.
- The Act provides in detail the circumstances and manner in which disclosure of identity information or authentication records can be made. Disclosure can be made only pursuant to an order of a court no inferior to that of a District Judge and/or disclosure made in the interest of national security in pursuance of a direction of an officer not below the rank of a Joint Secretary to the Government of India specially authorized for the said purpose. Further, any direction issued pursuant to concerns of national security, shall be reviewed by an Oversight Committee consisting of

the Cabinet Secretary and the Secretaries to the Government of India in the Department of Legal Affairs and the Department of Electronics and Information Technology, before it takes effect. Any such direction would be valid for three months from date of issue and extended for further period of three months after review by the Oversight Committee. However, under no circumstances core biometrics shall be shared under whatsoever circumstances.

## **Offences and Penalties**

- Contravention of any provisions of the Act would attract penalties as specifically provided for under the Act.
- Penalties has been prescribed:
  - For impersonation of Aadhaar number holder
  - Disclosing identity information
  - Unauthorized access/tampering to CIDR
  - ° Unauthorized use of identity information by requesting entity
- For non-compliance of the intimation requirements.
- Residuary penalties.

## Miscellaneous

The Aadhaar number may be used for establishing the identity of an individual for any purpose under law by the State or anybody corporate or person subject to other provisions of the Act.

## **Reason for Judicial Intervention**

The Union and the State government had made Aadhaar compulsory to avail essential services including that of opening and accessing bank accounts, passports, cell phone services, etc. The petitioners contended that Aadhaar cannot be made mandatory and there was possibility of compromising private data because of its huge database that was vulnerable and frequently breached.

## **Troubling Times**

Trouble began to foment a little over a year after Aadhaar's introduction when the MHA expressed apprehension that enrolments could be faked due to loopholes in the process.

In 2012: The first signs of Aadhaar becoming mandatory came to light, when three oil companies initiated a pilot project in Mysore to have LPG refills linked to the ID.

In 2013: Banks began asking for Aadhaar to provide services.

In 2013: The 12-digit ID became the ID to link with bank accounts for getting LPG subsidies.

In September 2013: The Supreme Court began hearing the first of what would become a series of Aadhaar petitions. The petition was to examine the usefulness of the Aadhaar card.

But the court ruled that a lack of Aadhaar was not grounds to deprive people of any benefit or service. Government responded the Aadhaar-linked Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme for subsidized LPG supply would continue and the government would move the apex court for a 'correction' in the order.

In October 2013: The union cabinet cleared the National Identification Authority of India Bill, giving statutory status to the UIDAI.

But the apex court directive instructions that made Aadhaar mandatory to be withdrawn.

In 2014, the NDA government decided to review the Aadhaar scheme. The government mooted making Aadhaar mandatory for schemes like passports, PAN cards, Jan Dhan accounts, etc. But eventually the government clarified that Aadhaar was not mandatory for public services.

## **One Aadhaar to Rule Them All**

- In March and April 2016, 'Aadhaar now mandatory' tags to various services.
- It has been claimed recently that lack of safety of data in Aadhaar database is prone to leakage.
- A French hacker pseudonym Elliot Alderson described lacunae in mAadhaar App.
- Government maintained that Aadhaar was safe.

## Government reply's in Court

K. K. Venugopal, India's Attorney General, claimed in the apex court that the data was safe behind '13 feet high and 5 feet thick walls'.

Ajay Bhushan Pandey, UIDAI's CEO, said that breaking 'one bit' of the Aadhaar encryption would take more time than the age of the universe and the fastest super computer on Earth.

TRAI chairman, R. S. Sharma tweeted his Aadhaar number, inviting anyone who would be so inclined to cause him harm. The result of the 'challenge' was up in the air, but the government did get some ammunition in its side by way of Bill Gates, who claimed Aadhaar did not have any privacy issue and he would move the World Bank to have other countries emulate it.

#### **Legal Battles Continue**

The constitutional validity of the Aadhaar system (a nationwide biometric identification system) had been challenged before the Supreme Court. This issue was before a five judge bench of the court ('Aadhaar Bench'). One of the key issues is whether the norms for compilation of the demographic biometric data by the government violates the right to privacy. To answer this question the Supreme Court had to first answer: whether there is a constitutionally mandated fundamental right to privacy. Due to conflicting judgments of the Supreme Court in the past, the Aadhaar Bench referred this question before a nine judge bench of the Supreme Court ('Privacy Bench') to finally determine whether there existed a fundamental right to privacy.

A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court has ruled that Indians enjoy a fundamental right to privacy, that it is intrinsic to life and liberty and thus comes under Article 21 of the Indian constitution.

The nine judge bench, led by the then Chief Justice J.S. Khehar, pronounced a unanimous judgement even if the judges had slightly different arguments as to how privacy is intrinsic to right to life and liberty.

The Supreme Court has overruled verdicts given in the M.P. Sharma case in 1958 and the Kharak Singh case in 1961, both of which said that the right to privacy is not protected under the Indian constitution.

Emboldened by the Supreme Court's Right to Privacy verdict, petitioners decided to move the court to settle the Aadhaar matter once and for all.

**In 2017:** Set-up a five judge bench to hear a plea on the validity of the Aadhaar Act.

One of the first things the apex court did was to have the deadline for linking Aadhaar with various schemes upto 31 March 2018.

Soon after, the UIDAI asked all banks to expedite linking of Aadhaar to bank accounts but said it was in line with the order the Supreme Court gave.

The apex court held that there was a need to balance an individual's privacy and the State's responsibility and the Aadhaar Act could not be declared unconstitutional because of citizens being denied services for want of the ID card. All the while, the Centre maintained that it would not deny people their due if they lacked an Aadhaar.

### **Question 1: Whether the Aadhaar Project Creates or has Tendency to Create Surveillance State and is, thus, Unconstitutional on this Ground?**

#### Judgment:

- The architecture of Aadhaar as well as the provisions of the Aadhaar Act do not tend to create a surveillance state, said the majority order.
- According to the order, this is ensured by the manner in which the Aadhaar project operates. Drawing from representations made by the Unique Identification Authority of India and the government, the order stated.
- During the enrolment process, minimal biometric data in the form of iris and fingerprints is collected. UIDAI does not collect purpose, location or details of transaction. Thus, it is purpose blind. The information collected, as aforesaid, remains in silos. Merging of silos is prohibited. The requesting agency is provided answer only in 'Yes' or 'No' about the authentication of the person concerned.
- The authentication process is not exposed to the internet world.
- There are sufficient authentication security measures taken.
- There is an oversight by Technology and Architecture Review Board and Security Review Committee.
- During authentication no information about the nature of transaction is obtained.
- The authority has mandated use of registered devices for all authentication requests.

## **Question 2: Whether the Aadhaar Act violates the Right** to Privacy and is Unconstitutional on this Ground?

#### Judgment:

- Referring to the earlier Supreme Court decision that determined privacy to be a fundamental right, the order states that any restraint on privacy must meet three tests.
  - Backed by law
  - Legitimate state aim
  - Proportionality
- The existence of the Aadhaar Act and delivery of welfare benefits fulfil the first two requirements.
- The order noted that the third test of proportionality has also been met because the purpose of the act is to ensure deserving beneficiaries of welfare schemes are correctly identified.
- It also achieves the balancing of two competing fundamental rights: right to privacy on the one hand and right to food, shelter and employment on the other.
- But the majority order directs that Section 7 of the Act, which says proof of Aadhaar number is necessary for receipt of certain subsidies.
- As per Section 7 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016, any individual who is desirous of availing any subsidy, benefit or service for which the expenditure is incurred from the Consolidated Fund of India, shall require to furnish proof of possession of Aadhaar number or undergo Aadhaar based authentication. In case the individual does not have Aadhaar, he/she shall make an application for enrolment and the individual shall be offered alternate and viable means of identification for delivery of the subsidy, benefit or service.

On that basis, CBSE, NEET, JEE, UGC, etc., cannot make the requirement of Aadhaar mandatory as they are outside the purview of Section 7 and are not backed by any law.

## Question 3: Whether the Aadhaar Act could be Passed as 'Money Bill' within the Meaning of Article 110 of the Constitution?

Judgment

• Since the purpose of the Aadhaar Act is to create unique identification so that citizens can avail government subsidy, benefit or service, the expenditure for which would be from the Consolidated Fund of India, it can be passed as a Money Bill.

## Other Important Points

#### Aadhaar–PAN Tax Linkage Maintained.

The order upholds Section 139AA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 that makes it mandatory to quote Aadhaar when filing tax returns or for allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN).

 No Mandatory Use of Aadhaar To Open A Bank Account

The order found that such mandatory provision of Aadhaar to open a bank account or maintain an existing one does not stand the test of proportionality and 'violates the right to privacy of a person which extends to banking details'.

 No Mandatory Linking of Aadhaar with Mobile Number.

The order found that since the circular issued by the Department of Telecommunications making such linkage mandatory was not backed by a law, it was illegal and unconstitutional.

It's important to note that Justices Chandrachud and Bhushan delivered separate opinions in this case. While Justice Bhushan concurred with the majority view, Justice Chandrachud found the Aadhaar act 'to be declared as unconstitutional'. He also stated that the Aadhaar Act was not a Money Bill. 'Superseding the authority of Rajya Sabha constitutes as a fraud on the constitution.'
