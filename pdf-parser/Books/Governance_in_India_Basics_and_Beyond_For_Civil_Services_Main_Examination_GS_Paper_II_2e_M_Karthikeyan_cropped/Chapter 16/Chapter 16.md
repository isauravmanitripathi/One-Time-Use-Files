# **ELECTORAL REFORMS**

India's democratic setup is a paradigm for many countries in the world due to its remarkable success over the past six decades. The heart of India's democratic system witnesses regular elections with the participation of the largest electorate in the world. In order to safeguard the core values of fair and free elections in this dynamic scenario, it is important to have a just and unbiased electoral process with a greater citizen participation. Thus, in accordance to the responsibility bestowed upon by the Constitution of India, the Election Commission of India has always remained actively involved in finding out ways through which the purity and integrity of the election process is preserved.

However, there are certain challenges and issues that electoral system has faced over the years. Trust and confidence of citizens in electoral system can be affected if these challenges remain unattended. Thus, keeping in view these difficulties the Election Commission of India after conducting extensive study and research recommends certain changes that need to be taken up expeditiously to amend certain provisions of law.

These suggested reforms will prove to be extremely useful in addressing the existing issues and challenges and would go a long way in enhancing the quality of democracy in India. The following are the reforms as suggested by the Election Commission of India.

# **Amendment Proposed to Constitution of India**

**(a) Constitutional protection for all members of the Election Commission of India:** Under Clause (2) of Article 324, the Election Commission shall consist of the Chief Election Commissioner and such number of other Election Commissioners, if any, as the President may from to time specify and the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and Election Commissioners shall, subject to the provisions of any law made in that behalf by Parliament, be made by the President.

Article 324(5) of the Constitution was incorporated to ensure the independence of the Commission and free it from external, political interference and thus expressly provides that the removal of the Chief Election Commissioner from office shall be on 'like manner and on the like grounds as a Judge of the Supreme Court'. The Article 324(5) also specifies that any other Election Commissioner or a Regional Commissioner shall not be removed from office except on the 'recommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner'.

The Goswami Committee in its Report on Electoral Reforms in 1990 recommended that the '*protection of salary and other allied matters relating to the Chief Election Commissioner and the Election Commissioners should be provided for in the Constitution itself on the analogy of the provisions in respect of the Chief Justice and Judges of the Supreme Court. Pending such Election measures being taken, a parliamentary law should be enacted for achieving the object*'.

The Commission time and again in its various correspondence and reports has expressly opined that the current wording of Article 324(5) is 'inadequate' and requires an amendment to bring the removal procedures of Election Commissioners on par with the CEC to provide them with the 'same protection and safeguard[s]' as the Chief Election Commissioner.

Even the Supreme Court in 1995, in the case of T.N. Seshan, Chief Election Commissioner of India v. Union of India (UOI) and Ors. 1995 (4) SCALE 285, has held that the CEC is not superior to the Election Commissioners rather is at the same position as the other Election Commissioners by stating:

*'As pointed out earlier, the scheme of Article 324 clearly envisages a multi-member body comprising the CEC and the ECs. The RCs may be appointed to assist the Commission. If that be so the ECs cannot be put on par with the RCs. As already pointed out, ECs form part of the Election Commission unlike the RCs. Their role is, therefore, higher than that of RCs. If they form part of the Commission it stands to reason to hold that they must have a say in decision-making. If the CEC is considered to be a superior in the sense that his word is final, he would render the ECs non-functional or ornamental. Such an intention is difficult to cull out from Article 324 nor can we attribute it to the Constitution-makers. We must reject the argument that the ECs' function is only to tender advise to the CEC'.*

# **Reason for the proposed reform**

The reason for giving protection to a Chief Election Commissioner as enjoyed by a Supreme Court Judge in matters of removability from office was in order to ensure the independence of Commission from external pulls and pressure. However, the rationale behind not affording similar protection to other Election Commissioners is not explicable. The element of 'independence' sought to be achieved under the Constitution is not exclusively for an individual alone but for the whole institution. Thus, the independence of the Commission can only be strengthened if the Election Commissioners are also provided with the same protection as that of the Chief Election Commissioner.

# **Law Commission's Recommendation**

The Law Commission in its 255th Report (2015) endorsed the view of the Commission and suggested the following changes to be brought in Article 324:

- In sub-section (5), delete the words 'the Election Commissioners and' appearing after the words 'tenure of office of'.
- In the first proviso to sub-section (5), after the words 'Chief Election Commissioner' appearing before 'shall not be removed', add the following words, 'and any other Election Commissioner'; also, after the words 'conditions of service of the Chief Election Commissioner', add the following words, 'and any other Election Commissioner'.

• In the second proviso to sub-section (5), after the words 'provided further that', delete the words 'any other Election Commissioner or' occurring before 'a Regional Commissioner'.

# **Matters Related to Electoral Roll**

**(a) Use of common electoral rolls:** Article 324(1) of the Constitution of India empowers the Election Commission to, inter alia, supervise, direct, and control the preparation and revision of electoral rolls for all the elections to Parliament and State Legislatures, which is done by the Commission by the virtue of powers under The Representation of the People Act, 1951. Similarly, under Articles 243K and 243ZA and the relevant State laws, the State Election Commission supervises, directs, and controls the preparation and revision of electoral rolls for elections to the local bodies. There is no uniform law or procedure for State Election Commission to prepare these electoral rolls. Some States adopt the rolls prepared by the Commission while some prepare their rolls separately for elections. A proposal has been made by the Commission in this regard to bring in a reform with respect to use of common electoral rolls prepared by the Commission.

# **Reasons for the reform proposed**

There is a non-uniformity of practice amongst States which causes duplication of essentially the same task between two different constitutional bodies, that is, the Election Commission of India and the State Election Commissions that entails the same effort and expenditure again by the States. Further, it creates a confusion amongst the voters, since they may find their names present in one roll, but absent in another. Thus, the use of common electoral rolls will overcome the issue of duplication and confusion and will also save the unnecessary effort and wastage of money. By virtue of common electoral rolls, the Parliamentary and Assembly rolls can be used in the local body elections, saving time, effort and expenditure, with the requisite modifications based on the wards or polling areas of the local bodies.

# **Law Commission's Recommendation**

The Law Commission endorses the above suggestions of the Election Commission regarding introduction of common electoral rolls for Parliamentary, Assembly and local body elections. However, given that introducing common electoral rolls will require an amendment in the State laws pertaining to the conduct of local body elections, the Central Government should write to the various states in this regard.

**(b) Section 60 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950:** Under section 20A of The Representation of the People Act, 1950, Indian citizens living abroad owing to employment, education or otherwise, and have not acquired citizenship of another country, are entitled to be enrolled as elector in the native constituency in India in which his/her home address falls. Persons enrolled in the electoral roll under this section are called 'overseas electors'. The overseas electors have not been given any special voting facility which means that they can vote in person in the polling station concerned in the constituency in which they are enrolled.

# **Reason for the proposed reform:**

Voting in person is not a viable option for the overseas electors as they cannot be expected to travel to India for voting. A Committee appointed by the Commission to consider alternative voting options for the overseas electors recommended the facility of voting through proxy or voting through postal ballot paper with one-way electronic transmission of the postal ballot paper (from Returning Officer to elector) as alternative voting options for the overseas electors.

**(c) Section 14(B) of the Representation of the People Act, 1950:** Under section 14(b) of The Representation of the People Act, 1950, the qualifying date for eligibility for enrolment in the electoral roll of a particular year is 1st of January of that year. Thus, a person who turns 18 after 1st January remains deprived of enrolment and becomes entitled only when the roll is revised next year.

Section 14 (b) is as follows:

(b) 'qualifying date', in relation to the preparation or revision of every electoral roll under this Part, means the 1st day of January of the year in which it is so prepared or revised:] [Provided that 'qualifying date', in relation to the preparation or revision of every electoral roll under this Part in the year 1989, shall be the 1st day of April, 1989.]

# **Reasons for the proposed reform:**

Having only one qualifying date means that a large number of young persons who complete 18 years after 1st January would have to wait for next year for enrolment and would not be able to participate in elections held in the meanwhile. The Commission suggested that the law may be amended so that a person can be enrolled in the roll the day he or she turns 18. By such amendment, the principle of universal adult franchise is also respected and no person is deprived from enrolment for a period of one year.

# **Issues Related to Election Management**

**(a) Making any false statement or declaration before authorities punishable:** Section 31 of The Representation of the People Act, 1950 makes a person who in connection with preparation, revision or correction of an electoral roll or in connection with inclusion or exclusion of an electoral roll makes a statement or declaration in writing which is false, be punishable with imprisonment extending to one year or with fine or with both.

However, there is no parallel provision in The Representation of the People Act, 1951, to penalise a person making a false declaration in connection with conduct of elections.

# **Reasons for the proposed reform:**

There would be several cases of false statements before election authorities in connection with conduct of elections. In order to discourage motivated false statements before the election authorities, it would be useful to have a provision in The Representation of the People Act, 1951, similar to section 31 of the 1950 Act.

**(b) Proposal regarding filing of false affidavit:** Currently, a candidate to any National or State Assembly elections is required to furnish an affidavit, in the shape of Form 26 appended to The Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, containing information regarding their criminal antecedents, if any, their assets, liabilities, and educational qualification. Section 125A of The Representation of the People Act, 1951 provides for the penalty for filing false affidavit. The offence is punishable by up to 6 months, or with fine, or with both.

# **Reason for proposed reform:**

The Commission time and again has stressed on the importance of filing of true information by the candidates standing for elections in their affidavits. The filing of false affidavits in matters of election can have extremely serious consequences as it affects the purity of elections. The elector in order to make an informed choice has the right to know the correct information of the candidates. This view was also taken in the case of Krishnamoorthy v. Sivakumar (2009) 3 CTC 446 pertaining to panchayat elections where the Court held that failure to disclose complete information may amount to undue influence, and that incorrect or false information interferes with the free exercise of the electoral right of the voter. Filing of false declaration about the background of the candidate undermines the very basic value of candidate disclosure, in turn affecting the right of the electors to know the antecedents of candidate. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the punishment for filing false affidavit.

**Law Commission's recommendation:** The Law Commission in its 244th Report on 'Electoral Disqualifications' gave the following recommendations endorsing the view of the Election Commission:

- **(i)** Introduce enhanced sentence of a minimum of two years under section 125A.
- **(ii)** Include conviction under section 125A as a ground of disqualification under section 8(1) of The Representation of the People Act, 1951.
- **(iii)** Set up an independent method of verification of winners' affidavits to check the incidence of false disclosures in a speedy fashion.
- **(iv)** Include the offence of filing a false affidavit as a corrupt practice under section 123 of The Representation of the People Act, 1951.
- **(c) Section 126 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951**

Under the criminal jurisprudence any person can set the law into motion unless specifically excluded by an express provision under a statute. In **The Representation of the People Act, 1951, section 32 clause (3) provides that no court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under sub-section (1) unless there is a complaint made by order of or under authority from, the Election Commission or the Chief Electoral Officer of the State concerned**. However, no such provision is found under section 126 of the 1951 Act.

# **Reasons for proposed reform:**

The proposal of the Commission is that section 126 of The Representation of the People Act, 1951 may be given a relook and in particular, necessary amendments may be made by adding a clause in section 126 stating that 'no court shall take cognizance of any offence under section 126(1)(b) unless there is a complaint made by order of or under the authority from the Commission or the CEO of the State concerned as in the case of section 32 of the 1951 Act. Another amendment that is required to be made in the Act is to include 'print media' under the present provision since the current framework only includes display by electronic media.

**(d) Adjournment of poll or countermanding of election on the ground of bribery:** Article 324 of the Constitution vests in the Election Commission the superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of the electoral rolls for, and the conduct of, all elections to Parliament and to the Legislature of every State and of elections to the offices of the President and Vice President held under the Constitution. The powers conferred thereunder are of widest amplitude as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner (1978 SC851).

It was observed in M.S Gill's case that the framers of the Constitution took care to leave the scope of residuary power to Commission, foreseeing the infinite variety of situations that may emerge from time to time in such a large democracy as ours. Section 58A was inserted in The Representation of the People Act, 1951 to empower the Commission to countermand an election in the event of booth capturing in the constituency.

In S.Subramaniam Balaji v. Govt. of Tamil Nadu & Ors (2013) 9 SCC 659, the case relating to distribution of free gifts by the political parties (popularly known as 'freebies'), the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that '*although, the law is obvious that the promises in the election manifesto cannot be construed as 'corrupt practice' under section 123 of The Representation of the People Act, the reality cannot be ruled out that distribution of freebies of any kind, undoubtedly, influences all people. It shakes the root of free and fair elections to a large degree*'.

# **Reason for proposed Reform:**

Over the period of time, especially in the recent years, money has played a key role in influencing the 'decision making' at the polls. There have been several instances of seizure of large amount of cash, liquor, gift items etc. from the candidates and their agents during the elections. In some cases, following largescale instances of bribing of electors by candidates and workers of political parties, the Commission, using its plenary powers under Article 324 resorted to cancellation of the election process.

# **Issues Related to Logistics and Election Officials**

**(a) Section 13CC of the Representation Of The People Act, 1950 And Section 28a of the Representation Of The People Act, 1951:** Section 13CC of the Representation of the People Act, 1950 states that: '*Chief Electoral Officers, District Election Officers, etc., deemed to be on deputation to Election Commission – The officers referred to in this Part and any*  *other officer or staff employed in connection with the preparation, revision and correction of the electoral rolls for, and the conduct of, all elections shall be deemed to be on deputation to the Election Commission for the period during which they are so employed and such officers and staff shall, during that period, be subject to the control, superintendence and discipline of the Election Commission*'.

Section 28A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 states that

'*Returning officer, presiding officer, etc., deemed to be on deputation to Election Commission – The returning officer, assistant returning officer, presiding officer, polling officer, and any other officer appointed under this Part, and any police officer designated for the time being by the State Government, for the conduct of any election shall be deemed to be on deputation to the Election Commission for the period commencing on and from the date of the notification calling for such election and ending with the date of declaration of the results of such election and accordingly, such officers shall, during that period, be subject to the control, superintendence and discipline of the Election Commission*'.

# **Reasons for the reforms proposed**

Transfer of election officials on the eve of elections can disturb the election preparedness.

**(b) Empowering the District Election Officer to requisition:** Section 159(1) of The Representation of the People Act, 1951 states that

'*Staff of certain authorities to be made available for election work- (1) The authorities specified in subsection (2) shall, when so requested by a Regional Commissioner appointed under clause (4) of article 324 or the Chief Electoral Officer of the State, make available to any returning officer such staff as may be necessary for the performance of any duties in connection with an election*'.

# **Reasons for proposed reforms**

Section 26 of The Representation of the People Act, 1951 empowers the District Election Officers to appoint Presiding Officers and Polling Officers for polling stations falling in his district. Further, under section 20A of the 1951 Act, the District Election Officer is required to coordinate and supervise all work in the District in connection with conduct of elections. Therefore, for convenience, there should be express provisions empowering the District Election Officers to requisite staff for conduct of election under section 159 of the 1951 Act.

# **Issues Related to Nomination of Candidates**

**(a) Section 33(7) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 – Restriction on the number of seats from which one may contest:** As per the law of India, as it stands today, a candidate is permitted to contest an election from two different constituencies in a general election or a group of byelections or biennial elections. **Subsection (7) of section 33 of The Representation of the People Act, 1951**, allows a person to contest a general election or a group of byelections or biennial elections from a maximum of two constituencies whereas section 70 of the 1951 Act, species that if a person is elected to more than one seat in either House of Parliament or in the House or either House of the Legislature of a State (some states have a Legislative Council or Vidhan Parishad as well, along with the Vidhan Sabha), then he/she can only hold on to one of the seats that he/she won in the election. Subsection (7) was introduced through a 1996 amendment, prior to which there was no bar on the number of constituencies from which a candidate could contest.

The Election Commission proposed amendment of section 33(7) in the year 2004 to provide that a person cannot contest from more than one constituency at a time. However, in case the existing provisions are to be retained, a candidate contesting from two seats should bear the cost of the byelection to the seat that the contestant decides to vacate in the event of him/her winning both seats. The amount in such an event could be `5,00,000 for State Assembly and Council Election and `10,00,000 for election to the House of People (as proposed at that point of time).

In the year 2014, a writ petition was led before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, by the Voter's Party (a registered political party) challenging the constitutional validity of sub-sections (6) and (7) of section 33 and 70 of The Representation of the People Act, 1951. The petition is pending.

# **Reasons for the proposed reform**

When a candidate contests from two seats, it is imperative that he has to vacate one of the two seats should he win both. This, apart from the consequent unavoidable financial burden on the public exchequer and the manpower and other resources for holding byelection against the resultant vacancy, would be an injustice to the voters of the constituency which the candidate is quitting from.

**(b) Disqualifications under Chapter III of the Representation of the People Act, 1951:** In the judgement dated 7th August, 2015, the Hon'ble Delhi Court has directed the Election Commission to consider the possibility, if any, of putting an impediment on a defaulter of public dues contesting election in order to ensure quick recovery of the said dues. In pursuance of the said judgement, the Commission has recommended amending provisions for disqualifications laid down in Chapter III of The Representation of the People Act, 1951so as to provide for disqualification in the event of defaulting in clearing public dues.

**Direction of the Delhi High Court:** The High Court made the following observations in its judgment:

- According to the report by India Today, the politicians and political parties in occupation of government accommodation allotted to them were in default of payment of electricity, water and telephone charges with respect thereto and no steps were being taken by the municipal and other governmental agencies for recovery of the said public dues. It was further reported that some politicians and political parties also owed money to five-star hotels run by India Tourism Development Corporation Ltd. (ITDC), a Public Sector Corporation, for events, functions held therein or for use thereof and that the ITDC, run and managed by bureaucrats under the control of the said politicians had also not taken any action for recovery of the said dues which were again public money.
- The zeal with which the public bodies try to recover dues from ordinary citizens was found to be totally missing in the case of politicians and political parties and which in fact had resulted in the accumulating arrears. There is a total lack of will on the part of governmental agencies to whom dues are owed, to recover the same from the politicians and political parties.
- The possibility of having the recoveries effected through the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Secretariats by virtue of Rule 23 of the Members of Parliament (Travelling and Daily Allowances) Rule, 1957 also proved to be futile since the amounts due being very huge could not be recovered by way of deduction from the salaries.
- Neither the persuasion by the Supreme Court of the governmental agencies to whom dues are owed could prompt them for recovery nor did the different avenues explored by the Court for recovery have any substantial success due to the reluctance on the part of the governmental agencies to treat

the political masters equally, as they treat other citizens.

- The defaulter politicians and political parties are found to have misused their position of power for their own benefit and gain which is against the simple premise of law that the public offices shall not be the workshops of personal gain.
- This calls for issue of directions to ensure that the MPs, MLAs and the political parties, taking advantage of the clout enjoyed by them over the officials of the municipal, electricity, water, telephone and other facilities agencies, are not able to escape without paying the dues.

Thus, the High Court under Paragraph 13 (reproduced below) issued, among others, the following directions:

- ° The ECI to, as directed in the earlier orders in this petition, continue to insist upon the candidates desirous of contesting an election to Parliament or to Legislative Assembly, along with their nomination form furnishing an affidavit of their being not in arrears of any public dues and if such candidate is in occupation of or in the past ten years been in occupation of any government accommodation to furnish a No Dues Certificate from the agency providing electricity, water and telephone to the said accommodation.
- ° The ECI to also within six months consider the possibility if any of putting any impediment to a defaulter of public dues contesting election, to ensure quick recovery of the said dues.

# **Issues Related to Decriminalisation of Politics**

**(a) Decriminalisation of politics:** Section 8 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 deals with disqualification on conviction for certain offences. Under this Section, disqualification arises only on conviction and there is no disqualification prior to conviction even if a person is facing several serious charges.

The Election Commission proposed in its set of proposals of 1998 and 2004 that Section 8 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 should be amended to disqualify those persons from contesting election who are accused of an offence punishable by an imprisonment of 5 years or more even when trial is pending, given that the Court has framed charges against the person. To prevent misuse of the provision by the ruling party, the Commission suggested a compromise whereas only cases led prior to six months before an election would lead to disqualification of a candidate. In addition, the Commission proposed that candidates found guilty by a Commission of Enquiry should stand disqualified.

# **Some Important Judgements**

In 2002, the Hon'ble Supreme Court gave a historic ruling in Union of India (UOI) v. Association for Democratic Reforms and Anr. With People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) and Anr. v. Union of India (UOI) and Anr. (2002) 5 SCC 294 that every candidate, contesting an election to the Parliament, State Legislatures or Municipal Corporation, has to declare their criminal records, financial records and educational qualifications along with their nomination paper.

In 2005, the Supreme Court in Ramesh Dalal v. Union of India held that a sitting Member of Parliament (MP) or Member of State Legislature (MLA) shall also be subject to disqualification from contesting elections if he is convicted and sentenced to not less than 2 years of imprisonment by a court of law.

In Lily Thomas v. Union of India 2000 (4) SCALE 176, the Court held that Section 8(4) of The Representation of the People Act, 1951 is unconstitutional which allows MPs and MLAs who are convicted to continue in office till an appeal against such conviction is disposed off.

Further in 2013, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has requested the 20th Law Commission of India vide letter dated 16th January, 2013 to consider the matter again under two grounds, viz. disqualifications on the ground of framing of charges by the court or upon the presentation of the report by the investigating officer under Section 173 of Code of Criminal Procedure Code and disqualification on the ground of filing false affidavit under Section 125A of the Act of 1951. As per the concerns of the court, the Law Commission has suggested recommendations titled 'Electoral disqualifications' in its 244th report on Electoral Reforms.

The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Krishnamoorthy v. Sivakumar & Ors. (2015) case, while observing that the crucial recognised ideal which is required to be realised is eradication of criminalisation of politics and corruption in public life decided that '*disclosure of criminal antecedents of a candidate, especially, pertaining to heinous or serious offence or offences relating to corruption or moral turpitude at the time of filing of nomination paper as mandated by law is a categorical imperative and concealment or suppression of this nature deprives the voters to make*  *an informed and advised choice as a consequence of which it would come within the compartment of direct or indirect interference or attempt to interfere with the free exercise of the right to vote by the electorate, on the part of the candidate*'.

# **Reasons for the proposed amendment**

Persons with criminal background, accused of serious offences contesting election sends very negative signals about our electoral process. Many of such persons facing charges of grave nature end up winning election and enter our temple of democracy namely the Houses of Parliament and State Legislature which is highly undesirable and the issue needs to be addressed.

The Commission while making the proposal is fully conscious of the general principles of criminal jurisprudence that a person is deemed to be innocent until proven guilty. But the proposed amendment will be in the larger national interest which should take precedence over the interests of the individuals.

# **Recommendation by Law Commission**

Expediting trials in relevant courts where a case is led against a sitting MP/MLA and to conduct the trial on a day-to-day basis with an outer limit of completing the trial in one year. If the trial cannot be completed within the said time period or the charge is not quashed in the said period, the trial judge shall give reasons in writing to the relevant High Court.

Once the said period expires, two consequences may ensue: (i) The person may be automatically disqualified at the end of the said time period

(ii) The right to vote, remuneration and prerequisites of office shall be suspended at the end of the said period up to the expiry of the House.

Retroactive application from the date the proposed amendments come into effect, all persons with criminal charges (punishable by more than five years) pending on that date are liable to be disqualified subject to certain safeguards.

The punishment for filing false affidavits under Section 125A be increased to a minimum of two years, and that the alternate clause for fine be removed.

Conviction under Section 125A should be made a ground for disqualification under Section 8(1) of the RPA, 1951.

The filing of false affidavits should be made a corrupt practice under Section 123 of the RPA.

**(b) Use of religion in the name of electoral gain:** Elections are the manifestations of popular consent in a democratic society. History assents that it has significant repercussions on the making of a nation's governance and the nature of its policies. The framers of the Indian Constitution were concerned about the control that religion might exercise over the selection of government. A lot of dialogue and debate was made in the Constitutional assembly debates regarding the inclusion of word 'secularism'. The Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India, officially known as The Constitution (Forty-second amendment) Act, 1976 was in the following lines '*The democratic institutions provided in the Constitution are basically sound and the path for progress does not lie in denigrating any of these institutions. However, there could be no denial that these institutions have been subjected to considerable stresses and strains and that vested interests have been trying to promote their selfish ends to the great detriment of public good. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Constitution to spell out expressly the high ideals of socialism, secularism and the integrity of the nation, to make the directive principles more comprehensive and give them precedence over those fundamental rights which have been allowed to be relied upon to frustrate socio-economic reforms for implementing the directive principles*...... In the Preamble to the Constitution,-(a) for the words 'SOVEREIGNDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC' the words 'SOVEREIGNSOCIALIST SECULAR DEM-OCRATIC REPUBLIC' shall be substituted; and (b) for the words 'unity of the Nation', the words 'unity and integrity of the Nation' shall be substituted.

An Amendment Bill, [Representation of the People (Second Amendment) Bill, 1994] was introduced in the Lok Sabha to provide provision(s) to question the acts of misuse of religion by political parties before the Hon'ble High Court. However, the same lapsed in 1996 with the dissolution of 10th Lok Sabha. The Commission has forwarded the recommendation again on 2010.

Earlier Goswami Committee in its report in 1990 on Electoral Reforms had suggested parallel recommendation, which read as follows: '*Election Commission shall have the power to make recommendations to the appropriate authority to (a) refer any matter for investigation to any agency specified by the Commission and (b) prosecute any person who has committed an electoral offence under this Act or (c) appoint any special court for the trial of any offence or offences under this Act (RP Act 1951)*'.

The above recommendations were included in the Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill, 1990 introduced in the Rajya Sabha. However, the said Bill was withdrawn by the government in December 1993, stating the Govt. would come up with a revised bill.

In the 255th report of the Law Commission on Electoral Reforms, recommendations were made to maintain internal democracy in the political parties, drawing a comparative study of electoral regulations in Germany, Portugal and Spain.

# **Reasons for the proposed reform**

The Ministry of Home affairs referred to the Commission the relevant part of the Report of the Liberhans Ayodhya Commission of Inquiry, in 2010, for action on some recommendations for action by the Election Commission against the parties which misuse religious sentiments.

The proposal was to initiate swift action against those persons who attempt to misuse religious sentiments or making appeals to voters through the mode of their piety by holding disguised religious rallies in places of worship as political supplication, to strengthen the existing provisions in the Codes of Conduct and other election-related laws.

Under the existing law, that is, section 123(3) and (3A) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, appeal on grounds of religion, race etc. and promotions of feelings of enmity between different classes of religion constitute corrupt practice and the same can be questioned only by way of an election petition. Further the same cannot be a subject of enquiry before the Commission when the election is in progress. Ironically these provisions will have application only during the period of election and there is no provision to challenge the corrupt practice of the candidate who lost the election.

- **(c) Making bribery in elections a cognizable offence:** The phenomenon of bribing of voters with money and essential commodities and buying out local representatives has always plagued Indian elections. Section 123(1) of The Representation of the People Act 1951 defines 'Bribery' as any gift, offer or promise by a candidate or his agent or any other person with the consent of a Candidate or his election agent giving gratification, to any person whomsoever, with the object, directly or indirectly of inducing
  - **(i)** A person to stand or not to stand as, or to withdraw or not to withdraw from being a candidate at an election.
  - **(ii)** An elector to vote or refrain from voting at an election.

**(iii)** An elector for having voted or refrained from voting.

Section 171B of IPC also describes Bribery broadly in the lines that, if a person advances a gratification to any person with the object of inducing him or any other person to exercise their electoral right or of rewarding any person for having exercised any such right or accepts either for himself or for any other person any gratification as a reward for exercising any such right or for inducing or attempting to induce any other person to exercise any such right; commits the offence of bribery.

Section 171C of IPC talks about undue influence at elections as whoever voluntarily interferes or attempts to interfere with the free exercise of any electoral right commits the offence of undue influence at an election by threatening any candidate or voter, or any person in whom a candidate or voter is interested, with injury of any kind, or by inducing a candidate or voter to believe that he or any person in whom he is interested will become or will be rendered an object of Divine displeasure or of spiritual censure.

In 2012 the Election Commission recommended to the Home Ministry to amend the existing law to make bribery during elections (both cash and kind) a cognizable offence, enabling police to arrest the violators without a warrant and to enhance the punishment up to two years. The Home Ministry has conveyed to the Election Commission that it has initiated the process to amend the Sections 171B and 171E of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973 for the same.

# **Reasons for the proposed reform**

The change in law have become necessary as there have been increasing incidents of bribery being detected in all elections, from local body polls to Lok Sabha elections. This is because, currently, bribery is a bailable offence attracting only minimal punishment.

Moreover, the experience on the ground has shown that the law enforcing authorities feel handicapped in apprehending the culprits because they cannot proceed without a warrant issued by a competent Magistrate under Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 on being moved under section 155 of the said Act, to search or arrest any person even on specific information about the corruptive practice. These provide the violators an opportunity to evade legal action.

# **Issues Related to Reforms in Political Parties**

**(a) Deregistration of political parties:** Section 29A of The Representation of the People Act, 1951 empowers the Election Commission of India to register associations and bodies as political parties. However, there is no constitutional or statutory provision that gives power to the Election Commission to de-register political parties.

The Supreme Court, in Indian National Congress (I) v. Institute of Social Welfare and Ors., (2002) 5 SCC 685, held that the law does not empower the Commission to de-register a political party on the grounds of violation of any provisions of constitution or any undertaking given to the Commission. It further held that

'34. However, there are three exceptions where the Commission can review its order registering a political party. First is where a political party obtained its registration by playing fraud on the Commission, Second, it arises out of Sub-section (9) of Section 29A of the Act and third, any like ground where no enquiry is called for on the part of the Election Commission, for example, where the political party concerned is declared unlawful by the Central Government under the provision of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 or any other similar law.

35. Coming to the first exception, it is almost settled law that fraud vitiates any act or order passed by any quasi-judicial authority even if no power of review is conferred upon it. In fact, fraud vitiates all actions. In Smith v. East Ellis Rural Distt. Council - (1956) 1 All E.R. 855 it was stated that the effect of fraud would normally be to vitiate all acts and order. In Indian Bank v. Satyam Fibres (India) Pvt. Ltd. - MANU/ SC/0657/1996 : AIR1996SC2592, it was held that a power to cancel/recall an order which has been obtained by forgery or fraud applies not only to courts of law, but also to statutory tribunals which do not have power of review. Thus, fraud or forgery practised by a political party while obtaining a registration, if comes to the notice of the Election Commission, it is open to the Commission to de-register such a political party.

36. The second exception is where a political party changes its nomenclature of association, rules and regulation abrogating the provisions therein conforming to the provisions of Section 29A(5) or intimating the Commission that it has ceased to have faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India or to the principles of socialism, secularism and democracy, or it would not uphold the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India so as to comply the provisions of Section 29A(5). In such case, the very substratum on which the party obtained registration is knocked off and the Commission in its ancillary power can undo the registration of a political party. Similar case is in respect of any like ground where no enquiry is called for on the part of the Commission. In this category of cases, the case would be where a registered political party is declared unlawful by the Central Government under the provisions of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 or any other similar law. In such cases, power of the 'Commission to cancel the registration of a political party is sustainable on the settled legal principle that when a statutory authority is conferred with a power, all incidental and ancillary powers to effectuate such power are within the conferment of the power, although not expressly conferred. But such an ancillary and incidental power of the Commission is not an implied power of revocation. The ancillary and incidental power of the Commission cannot be extended to a case where a registered political party admits that it has faith in the Constitution and principles of socialism, secularism and democracy, but some people repudiate such admission and call for an enquiry by the Election Commission. Reason being, an incidental and ancillary power of a statutory authority is not the substitute of an express power of review.

41. It may be noted that the Parliament deliberately omitted to vest the Election Commission of India with the power to de-register a political party for non-compliance with the conditions for the grant of such registration. This may be for the reason that under the Constitution the Election Commission of India is required to function independently and ensure free and fair elections. An enquiry into noncompliance with the conditions for the grant of registration might involve the Commission in matters of a political nature and could mean monitoring by the Commission of the political activities, programmes and ideologies of political parties. This position gets strengthened by the fact that on 30th June, 1994 the Representation of the People (Second Amendment) Bill, 1994 was introduced in the Lok Sabha proposing to introduce Section 29-B where under a complaint to be made to the High Court within whose jurisdiction the main office of a political party is situated for cancelling the registration of the party on the ground that it bears a religious name or that its memorandum or rules and regulations no longer conforming the provisions of Section 29-A(5) or that the activities are not in accordance with the said memorandum or rules and regulations. However, this bill lapsed on the dissolution of the Lok Sabha in 1996'.

The recommendation by Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice in 61st Report on Electoral Reforms-Code of Conduct for Political Parties & Anti Defection Law states:

'Under Section 29 (A) Representation of People Act, 1951, the Election Commission of India has been given power to register political parties but the power of de-registration of political parties has not been given to Election Commission of India under that law. However, the Election Commission of India has assumed the power under para 16 A of the Election Symbol (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968 to de-recognise the political parties in the event of violation of Model Code of Conduct. The net effect of de-recognition of political party makes that party almost dysfunctional as its symbol is taken away. The Committee, therefore, recommends that the power to de-recognise political parties on account of violation of Model Code of Conduct may be incorporated in the Representation of People Act, 1951 itself'.

# **Reasons for the proposed reforms**

Many political parties get registered, but never contest election. Such parties exist only on paper. The possibility of forming political parties with an eye on availing the benefit of income tax exemption also cannot be ruled out. It would only be logical that the Commission which has the power to register political parties is also empowered to de-register in appropriate cases.

**(b) Tax relief for political parties:** Section 13A of the Income-tax Act, 1961 confers tax-exemption to political parties for income from house property, income by way of voluntary contributions, income from capital gains and income from other sources. In other words, only income under the head salaries and income from business or profession are chargeable to tax in the hands of political parties in India. Political parties registered with the Election Commission of India are exempted from paying Income Tax under section 13A of Income Tax Act, 1961 as long as the political parties comply with the proviso to section 13A, that is, if they file their Income Tax Returns every assessment year along with their audited accounts, income/expenditure details and balance sheet.

In 2003, sections 29B and 29C were inserted in The Representation of the People Act, 1951 making provisions regarding receiving of donations/contributions by political parties from individuals and companies (other than govt. companies). Section 29C provides that for contribution in excess of `20,000 in a year, the treasurer/authorised person of the party shall prepare a report of such contributions. The report is required to be submitted on an annual basis to the Commission before the due date for furnishing the return of its income, and failure to do so would render the party ineligible for any tax relief under the Income Tax Act notwithstanding any provisions therein.

# **Reason for the proposed reform**

There could be cases where political parties could be formed merely for availing of provisions of income tax exemption if the facility, that are at the expense of the public exchequer, is provided to all political parties.

**(c) Compulsory maintenance of accounts by political parties:** Section 13A(a) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 requires the political parties to keep and maintain 'such books of account and other documents as would enable the Assessing Officer to properly deduce its income therefrom'. Section 13A(a) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 states that the accounts of such political party must be audited by an accountant as defined in the Explanation below sub-section (2) of section 288.

Section 29C of The Representation of the People Act, 1951 states that the treasurer of a political party or any other person authorised by the political party in its behalf shall, in each financial year, prepare a report declaring the donations received from persons or non-government companies in that financial year. Section 29C (3) states that the said report must be submitted before the due date for furnishing a return of its income of that financial year under section 139 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to the Election Commission. Section 29C (4) provides that tax exemption under section 13A of the Income Tax Act will not be availed to a political party which fails to submit the said report.

The 'Guidelines and Application Format for Registration of Political Parties under section 29A of The Representation of the People Act' by the Election Commission of India requires the parties seeking registration to maintain their accounts on accrual system and to be annually audited by Auditor on the panel of Comptroller and Auditor General of India. It further states that the audited annual accounts should be submitted to the Election Commission within 6 months of the end of financial year.

# **Reason for the proposed reform**

Political parties are major stakeholders in a democracy and they should be accountable to the public. This will ensure transparency and empower people to make informed decisions about electing their representatives.

**(d) Accounting and auditing report of political parties:** There is no legislation or regulation or rule which prescribes either (a) standard financial accounting and reporting framework, or (b) auditing framework for financial statements of political parties in India.

# **Reason for the proposed reform**

Accounting and auditing standards would help political parties to maintain uniformity in presentation of financial statements, proper disclosure and transparency of their accounts.

**(e) Prohibition on anonymous donations:** There is no constitutional or statutory prohibition on receipt of anonymous donations by political parties in India. But there is an indirect partial ban on anonymous donations through the requirement of declaration of donations under section 29C of The Representation of the People Act, 1951.

# **Reason for the proposed reform**

Although section 29C of The Representation of the People Act, 1951 requires the political parties to declare their donations, however such declaration is mandated only for contributions above `20,000.

**(f) Cap on expenditure by political party on a candidate for election campaign:** The ECI issued transparency guidelines under Article 324 of the Constitution of India bearing No. 76/PPEMS/Transparency/2013 dated 29th August, 2014 with effect from 01st October, 2014 stating that although there is no cap on expenditure by political parties for propagating their program, parties are required to adhere to the cap prescribed in section 77(3) of The Representation of the People Act, 1951 and Rule 90 of the Election Rules while providing 'financial assistance' to candidates in their election campaigns. These amounts should be paid only by a crossed account payee cheque or draft or bank transfer, and not by cash.

# **Reason for the proposed reform**

This amendment will ensure accountability and place a check on election expenditure by candidates.

**(g) Ceiling of campaign expenditure by political parties:** There is no limit on the campaign expenditure by political parties.

Law Commission of India report on Electoral Reforms, Report No. 255 (12th March, 2015) observed:

'2.28.3 Furthermore, Section 77 of the RPA only regulates the election expenses of candidates. Political parties are free to spend any amount as long as it is for the general party propaganda, and not towards an independent candidate. Thus, there is no ceiling on party expenditure. It is recommended that the law on this point does not change, namely that there are no caps on party expenditure under the RPA given that it would be very difficult to fix an actual, viable limit of such a cap and then implement such a cap. In any event, as the experience with section 77(1) discussed above reveals, in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, on average candidates showed election expenditures of 59% of the total expenses limit. There is no reason why the same phenomenon of under-reporting will not transpire amongst parties.

2.28.4 Placing legislative ceilings on party expenditure or contributions will not automatically solve the problem, especially without putting in place a viable alternative of complete state funding of elections (which in itself is next to impossible right now). Our previous experience in prohibiting corporate donations in 1969 did not lead to a reduction in corporate donations. Instead, in the absence of any alternative model for raising funds, it greatly increased illegal, under the table and black money donations.

2.28.5 Although the problem of black money and under-reporting will remain under the existing regime of no caps on individual contribution and party expenses, it has to be tackled through a stricter implementation of the anti-corruption laws and RTI and improved disclosure norms. It might be desirable to regularly re-examine the 7.5% profit cap on company's contributions in light of the intended rationale, since the former can become a meaningless limit in the context of big companies'.

# **Reason for the proposed amendment**

The limit on campaign expenditure will ensure levelplaying field for all political parties and curb the menace of unaccounted money in elections. Further it will also control the money power used during election by political parties and their allies.

**(h) Limitation on the number of star campaigners:** As per section 77 of The Representation of the People Act, 1951, the expenditure incurred by the leaders of a political party on account of travel by air or by any other means shall not be deemed to be expenditure in connection with the election incurred or authorised by a candidate. Explanation (2) of the section defines political parties to include 40 persons of a recognised political party and 20 persons of a party other than the recognised political party, that is, registered unrecognised parties, whose names have been communicated to the Chief Electoral Officer and Election Commission of India within a period of 7 days from the date of notification. Such political leaders as communicated to the CEO and the Election Commission are known as Star Campaigners.

There is no prescribed number of star campaigners for byelections.

# **Reason for the proposed reform**

The maximum number of star campaigners should be prescribed for byelections to ensure level playing field and for smoother election management.

# **Issues Related to Election Campaign and Advertisement**

**(a) Ban on exit polls and opinion polls:** Opinion poll, sometimes simply referred to as a poll, is a kind of human research survey which is conducted to find out the public opinion before the elections. It is a way in which through a scientific survey the views of a particular group of people can be ascertained. Unlike Opinion Poll, Exit Poll is a post-election poll which is conducted when an elector walks out after casting his or her vote. These kinds of polls aim at predicting the actual result on the basis of the information collected from the voters.

The Representation of the People Act under section 126A bans conducting and disseminating results of exit polls during the period starting from commencement of polls till the completion of polls in all phases. According to the present scheme of The Representation of the People Act, 1951, section 126(1) (b) which prohibits the display of any election matter during the period of 48 hours before the hour fixed for conclusion of poll, is only limited to display by means of 'cinematograph, television or other similar apparatus'; and does not deal with the independence and robustness of the opinion polls themselves. However, there exists a lacuna as a ban on publishing such election matters in electronic media does not extend itself to print media. New sections 126A and 126B for the restriction on publication and dissemination of result of exit polls. However, in the present framework there is no restriction on conducting opinion polls or disseminating results of opinion polls even in phased elections.

The Commission has been of the view that there should be some restriction or regulation on the publishing/dissemination of the results of opinion polls also. The Commission had issued certain guidelines in this regard in 1998 which were subsequently challenged before the Courts. Later, on the observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the Commission did not have the power to enforce these guidelines, the same were withdrawn.

# **Reasons for the proposed reform**

The Commission recommends that there should be a restriction on publishing the results of such poll surveys before the elections and reiterates its view that like the Exit Polls, there should also be some restriction on conducting and disseminating the results of Opinion Polls right from the day of the first notification of an election till the completion of the poll in all the phases where a general election is held at different phases.

# **Law Commission's Recommendation**

The Law Commission in its Report in the year 2015 endorsed the view of the Commission and has called for the regulation of opinion polls so as to ensure that first, the credentials of the organisations conducting the poll is made known to the public; second, the public has a chance to assess the validity of the methods used in conducting the opinion polls; and third, the public is made adequately aware that opinion polls are in the nature of forecasts or predictions, and as such are liable to error.

**(b) Ban on government-sponsored advertisement before elections:** In politics, there exists use of advertising campaigns to influence political debate, and ultimately the voters. Presently, there is a trend wherein the Central and various State Governments embark upon 'election advertising' in the guise of providing information to the public. Such kind of an advertisement released with an eye on the election contain material intended or likely to affect voting in an upcoming election.

# **Reasons for the proposed reform**

The advertisements highlighting the achievements made by the government are understandably incurred from the public exchequer and are given or created with a view to influence the electorate in favour of the ruling party.

The Item VII clause (iv) of the Model Code of Conduct for the Guidance of Political Parties and Candidates, prohibits the issue of advertisement at the cost of public exchequer in the newspapers and other media. The misuse of official mass media during the election period for partisan coverage of political news and publicity regarding achievements with a view to furthering the prospects of the party in power is also prohibited under the said Item VII. However, the problem arises as the Model Code of Conduct comes into operation only from the date on which the Commission announces an election and the advertisements released prior to the announcement of elections are not prohibited under the Model Code of Conduct.

# **(c) Section 126 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951**

The section 126 of The Representation of People Act, 1951 prohibits electioneering activities by way of public meetings, public performance, processions, advertisements through cinematograph, television or similar apparatus during the period of 48 hours, the time fixed for conclusion of poll. The advertisements in TV and Radio are also prohibited during these 48 hours under the above-mentioned provision. However, due to the existing gap in the Act, the political parties and candidates issue advertisements in the newspapers during this period including on the day of polling and also indulge in house to house visits.

A distorted advertisement in print media on the poll day leaves the other candidates with no remedy to undo the damage.

# **Reasons for the proposed reform**

The Commission is of the view that such activities need to be prohibited and therefore, proposes that section 126 must be amended in the interest of fair and free elections to prohibit publication of advertisements by political parties in print media also (as in electronic media) during the period of 48 hours before the polling to allow the voters to arrive at an unprejudiced opinion.

**(d) Paid news in connection with elections:** Free and fair elections is the foundation of any democracy and this can only be achieved when there is an absence of influence by money in corrupting the electoral process. According to a study conducted by the Commission, during the assembly elections held in the period 2011–2013 there have been 1987 cases where a notice for paid news were issued to the candidates and 1727 cases where the practice of paid news were confirmed by the District/State Level Committees appointed for the purpose.

The problem of 'paid news' especially during election campaign is a widespread phenomenon. This phenomena of paid news and its equivalent, political advertising being presented as news, are issues that cannot be treated separately. The Press Council of India also, in its report regarding paid news cases had recommended that paid news may be made a corrupt practice.

# **Reasons for proposed reforms**

The general public attaches great value in news report as distinguished from advertisements by political parties and candidates. This makes the news items a very important source of information concerning the political parties or candidates. On the contrary, paid news is masquerading as news and publishes advertisements in the garb of news items, totally misleading the electors. This raises potential concerns relating to the truth or falsity of claims and the possible defamatory effects of such news items and advertisements. The right to know, that is, right to have accurate information is a necessity to make an informed choice for the electors. However, paid news have a tendency to influence this choice in a negative manner.

To make the matter worse, the whole exercise of publishing paid news involves use of unaccounted money and under reporting of election expenses of the candidates indulging in the malpractice. The influence of money also has the potential in resulting in uneven elections between people with dissimilar financial statures. Thus, in order to have 'fair' election in a democracy, a level playing field is paramount. This can only be achieved by mitigating the influence of money in elections.

# **(e) Section 125A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951**

Section 125A of The Representation of the People Act, 1951 has been inserted in the statute book in the year 2002 after the 170th Report of the Law Commission of 1999 in order to deter the candidates from filing false affidavits before the Returning Officer. The above-mentioned section provides with punishment with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine, or with both.

# **Reasons for proposed reforms**

Despite the introduction of Section 125A to the 1951 Act, there are several complaints about false affidavits filed by candidates. The wilful concealment of information and furnishing of false information needs to be curbed in the interest of free and fair elections.

Thus, for the purpose of effectively dealing with this issue and to tackle the menace of wilful concealment of information or furnishing of false information and to protect the right to information of the electors, the Commission recommended that the punishment under section 125A must be made more stringent.

# **Issues Related to Election Expenses and Election Petitions**

# **(a) Sections 78, 81 and 84 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951**

Section 78 of The Representation of the People Act, 1951:

Lodging of account with the district election officer: '(1) Every contesting candidate at an election shall, within thirty days from the date of election of the returned candidate or, if there are more than one returned candidate at the election and the dates of their election are different, the later of those two dates, lodge with the district election officer an account of his election expenses which shall be a true copy of the account kept by him or by his election agent under Section 77'.

Section 123(6) of The Representation of the People Act, 1951 provides that incurring or authorising of expenditure in contravention of section 77 is a corrupt practice.

As per Section 80 read with Section 81 of the 1951 Act, no election can be called into question except by way of election petition led before the High Court within 45 days from the date of election of the returned candidate.

# **Reason for the proposed reform**

The period of filing election petition is 45 days and the time period of filing accounts is 30 days. This leaves only a small period for a person to analyse expenditure statement of candidates and decide whether an election petition needs to be led. Hence, the time period for filing of accounts needs to be reduced. So that more time is available to analyse the accounts.

Further, there is no provision for filing an election petition against a candidate who has lost the election but is guilty of corrupt practice under Section 123 of the 1951 Act.

**(b) Election expenditure in case of adjournment of poll under Section 52 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951**

**Section 52 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951** provides for adjournment of poll in case of death of a candidate of a recognised political party.

# **Reason for the proposed reform**

Subsequent to the death of a candidate of a recognised party, the Election Commission calls upon the recognised political party, whose candidate has died, to nominate another candidate for the said poll within seven days of issue of such notice to such recognised political party. In order to ensure parity between the new candidate and the other contesting candidates, latter should be permitted to further incur election expenditure.

**(c) Appointment of additional judges in the High Courts:** Article 224 of the Constitution of India states: '(1) If by reason of any temporary increase in the business of a High Court or by reason of arrears of work therein, it appears to the President that the number of the Judges of that Court should be for the time being increased, the President may appoint duly qualified persons to be additional Judges of the Court for such period not exceeding two years as he may specify'.

The judges to people ratio is low in India and there is a need to appoint additional judges to clear the backlog of cases. The Commission has proposed that appointment of additional Judges in High Courts for trying election petitions to ensure their speedy disposal should be considered.

# **Other Such Issues Related to Election**

**(a) Form 26 under Rule 4A of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961:** Presently, the existing Form 26 (the format in which the candidates are required to submit affidavit) does not contain any clause requiring information with respect to the sources of income of the candidate

# **Reason for the proposed reform**

Declaring the source of income of the candidate and spouse would serve the interests of transparency and the right of electors to obtain information about their candidates for them to make an informed choice of their representative.

**(b) Rule-making authority to be vested in Election Commission:** The present framework of **The Representation of the People Act 1950 and 1951 under Section 28 and 169**, respectively empowers the Central Government to make rules after consultation with the Election Commission. However, the Central Government is not bound to accept such views or recommendations of the Commission.

# **Reasons for the proposed reform**

Since the Central Government is not bound to accept the views and recommendations of the Commission, there are instances when rules opposed to the specific recommendations of the Commission have been framed. On several other occasions, rules framed or amended have not been in line with the recommendations of the Election Commission.
