*'Success of democracy is impossible without participation of the people'* 

–Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.

As per the UN World Public Sector Report 2008, Citizen participation implies the involvement of citizens in wide range of policy-making activities, including the determination of levels of service, budget priorities, and the acceptability of physical construction projects in order to orient government programs toward community needs, build public support, and encourage a sense of cohesiveness within neighbourhoods.

The working definition for citizen engagement as per the United Nations Public Administration Country Studies (UNPACS), 'Citizen engagement in public administration implies the involvement of citizens in decision-making process of the state, through measures and/or institutional arrangements, so as to increase their influence of public policies and programmes ensuring a more positive impact on their social and economic lives.'

#### **Civil Society**

The World Bank in its report defines the civil society as follows:

'The term civil society refers to the wide array of nongovernmental and not for-profit organizations that have a presence in public life, expressing the interests and values of their members or others, based on ethical, cultural, political, scientific, religious or philanthropic considerations. Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) therefore, refer to a wide of array of organizations: community groups, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), labour unions, indigenous groups, charitable organizations, faith-based organizations, professional associations, and foundations'.

The term civil society has come to enjoy political, intellectual and administrative importance in recent years. But the concept has been in existence for a long time. Traditionally the terms civil society and state has been used interchangeably, and treated as synonyms.

Hegel was the first philosopher to separate civil society and the state, and this was followed by number of other scholars.

#### **Definitions of Civil Society**

The following are the various definitions given to the civil society; from this we can come to understand the concept and principle behind establishment and existence of the civil society.

The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics defined civil society as, 'The set of intermediate associations which are neither the state nor the (extended) family; civil society therefore, includes voluntary associations and firms and other corporate bodies'.

Fukuyama defined civil society, 'As the realm of spontaneously created social structures separate from the state that underlie democratic political institutions' (Fukuyama 1995:8).

To Dunn, 'Civil society is broadly regarded as the domain of relationships which falls between the private realm of the family on the one hand and the state on the other' (Dunn 1996:27).

Charles Taylor defined civil society as, 'A web of autonomous associations independent of the state, which bind citizens together in matters of common concern, and by their existence or actions could have an effect on public policy' (Kligman 1990:420).

Schmitter defined civil society as, '[A] set or system of self-organized intermediary groups' (Schmitter 1995:1).

Tester sees it, civil society is, 'The social relationships which involve the voluntary association and participation of individuals acting in their private capacities. In a simple and simplistic formula, civil society can be said to equal the milieu of private contractual relationships' (Tester 1992:8).

According to Andrew Heywood, 'Civil society refers to "a realm of associations, business, interest groups, classes" families and so on.'

According to Jan Aart Scholte, 'Civil society can be understood to be a political space where voluntary associations deliberately seek to shape the rules that govern aspects of social life.*'*

#### **Features of Civil Society**

The following are the features of civil society:

- **1.** It refers to an organized form of society.
- **2.** It covers a large space in the society.
- **3.** Even though it is an autonomous entity, it is still subject to control by the state.
- **4.** It is in pursuit of common good of the people.
- **5.** It helps in formulation of public opinion and sets-up demand which are general in nature.
- **6.** It is an advocate of pluralism in order to reduce the domination of the state.
- **7.** It serves as a moral compass in the community-value system.
- **8.** It is a non-state institution.
- **9.** Its existence implies that there is freedom of expression, freedom of thought, and other fundamental rights of the people.
- **10.** It is in opposition to authoritarianism and totalitarianism.
- **11.** By educating the people, it promotes the citizenship.

- **12.** It covers all the intermediary groups which is present between the state and the family.
- **13.** It facilitates participation of the citizens in the administrative matters.
- **14.** It does not coerce, rather it encourages voluntarism.

The current positive thinking about the civil society is that, civil society is area of freedom which correctly identifies its basic value as a condition for democracy; there can be no effective citizens where there is no democracy, the capacity of the citizens to choose their identities, duties, entitlements within the legal-politico framework is not possible without the development and role played by the civil society in a democracy.

Public organization is a necessary requirement in a liberal democracy, and for such social values, norms, etc., to get developed, the role of civil society is essential. Larger interests of the population, common civic ends can only be achieved through existence of a vibrant civil society.

#### **Components**

The following organizations and groups are included under the ambit of civil society:

- Community-based organizations
- Cooperative societies
- Youth groups
- Farmers organizations
- Religious associations
- Trade unions
- Non-governmental organizations
- Indigenous people's organizations
- Women's groups
- Other similar organized groups in the society

In countries like the USA, the civil societies are wellestablished, while in developing countries like India, they are still underdeveloped. It can be understood by the case in India that, here the civil society groups in opposition to the government is well-developed, but civil society as an associational group representing interests of wide segments of the society is not fully functional yet.

In India the civil society groups are apart from voluntary associations, seen as fluid associations of social groupings based on caste, kinship, religious ties, etc.

The civil society organization in India can be classified into the following five categories:

- **1.** Religious associations such as Deobandi Movement, Sikh Khalsa groups, Ramakrishna Mission, other Church missionaries, etc.
- **2.** Membership associations of various types, viz.,
  - Professional associations such as lawyers, doctors, etc.

- Self-help groups such as ward committees, women's organized self-help groups, and communitybased organizations in the villages, etc.
- Representational institutions such as farmers organization, trade unions, etc.
- Socio-cultural groups based on sports, other recreational activities, etc.
- **3.** Social movements of different kinds, viz.,
  - Movements to reform particular social evils like dowry, alcoholism, etc.
  - Movements focussing on process of governance like, anti-corruption campaign, civil liberties movement, etc.
  - Movements focussing on need of particular vulnerable groups such as, women, tribal groups, etc.
  - Movements of protest against disruptions and displacement due to developmental activities.
- **4.** Intermediary associations of various kinds with foreign aided agencies, viz.,
  - Philanthropic groups such as Child Relief and You (CRY), GATE foundation, and other associations, etc.
  - Mobilization based groups which help to fight for and mobilize the marginalized groups in the society.
  - Service delivery groups such as schools, old age homes, etc.
  - Advocacy groups which give voice for particular cause.
  - Other networks which extend the collective voice of the people.
  - Supportive groups which provide support to the community-based groups in the society.
- **5.** Traditional associations formed based on caste, tribe and ethnicity.

## **Role**

The civil society organizations play a very important role in welfare and development of the people in the society. The various dimensions of their role are as follows:

- **1.** They help in facilitation of people's participation in governance.
- **2.** They help the administration by identifying the target groups.
- **3.** They help to create political consciousness among the people by discussing various political issues with them.
- **4.** They help to strengthen the principle of self-help.
- **5.** They act as the watchdog of public interest.
- **6.** They make the administrative machinery more responsible and responsive to the needs and aspirations of the people.

- **7.** They mobilize and organize the poor for the purpose of socio-economic development.
- **8.** They help in identifying and using the local resources for the purpose of development and thereby make the communities self-reliant.
- **9.** They disseminate information and help to make people aware of the various schemes, programs, and activities, developed by the government for their welfare.
- **10.** They try to reduce the scope of corruption, by imposing a community system of accountability on the administration at lower levels.

It must be said here that the role of voluntary agencies is not to compete with the government, rather complement its activities.

Apart from this, the advantages of involving voluntary agencies in the development process is as follows:

- It creates a sense of solidarity among the people.
- It gives opportunity for the governing agencies to interact with the people directly for implementation of the development goals.
- It strives for participation in decision-making process.

The voluntary agencies also have other advantages over the governmental bodies. They are:

- **1.** They can have better rapport with the local people than that by the government officials.
- **2.** They can be very flexible, and act in such a manner as they are not bound by rigid bureaucratic rules, regulations and procedures.
- **3.** The volunteers involved are sincerer and more dedicated to the task of reducing the sufferings of the poor than the governmental staffs.
- **4.** They can motivate the public to participate more effectively than the governmental agencies.
- **5.** The efforts carried out by such agencies are more economical than that of the governmental bodies.

#### **Limitations**

Though there are numerous advantages of the civil society, they do suffer from a number of limitations, which are as follows:

- **1.** Interference and involvement of the political parties.
- **2.** Lack of qualified and trained professionals.
- **3.** Presence of diverse socio-economic environment in the country, such as casteism, poverty, and communalism, etc.
- **4.** Non-cooperation and even resistance by the bureaucrats.

- **5.** No holistic perspective, rather they have a limited narrow perspective.
- **6.** They do not have sufficient financial resources.
- **7.** They lack adequate and proper information base.
- **8.** The resistance offered by local landlords, moneylenders, etc.

Assessing both the merits and other disadvantages of the voluntary sector, the World Development Report in 1997 gave the following observation, 'The voluntary sector not only brings its own strengths to the table, but also its own weakness. It does a lot of good work in increasing public awareness, voicing citizen's concerns, and delivering services. Local self-help organizations are sometimes the preferred providers of local public goods and services, because of their closeness to local concerns. But their concern is often for certain religious or ethnic groups and not the society as a whole. Their accountability is limited and their resources are often constrained.'

## **People's Participation**

People's participation in the governance is considered to be one of the most important aspects which is discussed throughout the developed world. And India is no exception. People's involvement in governance is considered to be a significant variable for bringing accelerated socioeconomic development with equitable, sustainable and inclusive development. And it is considered to be a matter of utmost concern both at the conceptual level and the operational level.

Participation means involvement of the people directly and not indirect involvement through representation. Participation is therefore, recognized as intrinsic part of the process of development rather than its facilitator. Participation is needed because it increases the acceptability and utilization of the services. It also provides additional resources to a field which is continuously in scarcity of resources. It is an untapped resource base from where resources can be utilized to meets the needs of the unserved. People's participation is essential for development as it helps in breaking down, realigning and replacing economic, social and political structures that are considered antithetical to the development process.

Number of research scholars, social scientists, academicians, various research institutions and voluntary organizations have expressed their concern regarding people's participation in the development process. Also, great visionaries such as Aristotle, Mahatma Gandhi, Vinoba Bhave, J. S. Mill, Tagore, and Jayaprakash Narayan, etc., have called for large-scale people's participation in the developmental activities. Apart from these, the Directive Principles of State Policy, the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, (1992), the Five-Year Plans, the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have focussed their attention of participation of people in the developmental programmes. The first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru had suggested that, 'the basic objectives of administration should be inscribed in the room and on the walls of the administrations'. This expression can be considered as a desire requiring the ratio of relationship between administration and citizen.

If there is, this thinking that, everything will be done by the government and by the officials who are being paid for it, then the developmental plans or programmes will not give satisfactory or substantial results, success can only be achieved by involvement and participation of the people in the developmental process.

## **Factors Determining People's Participation**

The factors which determine people's participation are as follows:

- **Motivation and Leadership**: The people working at the grass roots should be able to enthuse and motivate the people to participate in the programmes and convince them of the benefits that they will receive. They must have leadership qualities and credibility. Moreover, encouragement for democratic leadership can go a long way in promoting people's participation.
- **Communication**: The people working at the grass roots should communicate with the people in the language and medium that they can understand. It is always possible that different programmes and group may require use of different media.
- **Extent of Programmes are Based on Felt Needs**: A programme can only be successful if it is designed to fulfil the needs of the people. For example, the VOs programme for providing nutritious low-cost weaning food is likely to be less successful if it is not perceived as the need of the people.

#### **Kinds and Methods of Participation**

The roots of democracy lie with the participation of the people in governance, but this participation can become more meaningful and stronger only when the people's participation is more pronounced in the developmental works. Such participation of people in the developmental works is not possible unless it benefits those who participate in it. If the programmes are just generalized schemes and are not modified to suit the needs of the local people, it would attract lesser participation from the people. Unless all conditions of beneficial participation are fulfilled, the people cannot participate in these developmental programmes. People will show interest only when they know what these developmental programmes are and how they will benefit them. There is indeed wide spread admission that, people's participation has tremendous impact on the execution of the plans. But unless all sections of people come forward to participate in such programmes, it would be difficult to achieve the desired results.

Participation and involvement of people help the local communities to identify and understand their problem, further they suggest solutions and look for opportunities to implement such solutions. Therefore, people themselves get involved in the delivery of basic minimum services which are essential for them. Decision-making of both the administration and the government are influenced by the participation of the people in the development process. They are of different kinds and methods:

- **1. Democratic or Political Participation:** It is the activity by the citizens of the country deliberated to influence the decisions of the government. It uses methods such as persuasion or pressure to influence the decision of the government to attain their ends such as replacing or retaining the existing government or changing some aspects of the political system or completely overhauling and altering the system as a whole. This term is an umbrella concept encompassing number of other terms each of which has its own different causes and consequences that change based on the changing social and economic trends.
- **2. Social Participation:** All participation including in political set-up, economic schemes and administrative sphere, which involve members of the society as a whole or in varying degrees and bring consequences to the society as a whole fall under the ambit of social participation. Apart from this, the social participation also takes the form of social protests such as strikes, *dharnas* and demonstrations.
- **3. Administrative Participation:** It is used synonymously with that of citizen participation in the decision-making process, i.e., participation in all aspects of the development planning such as, programme planning, policy planning, implementation and evaluation of policies to achieve their desired results and goals. Such participation is also called as 'Programme Participation' and 'Community Development'.
- **4. Participation as Organization:** This form of participation will take place when the beneficiaries are part of the administering agency. The major advantage of

such participation is that, at higher levels, it lets the beneficiaries determine the nature and structure of the organization. This therefore, provides the beneficiaries enhanced role in all stages of the programme, such as, the planning, selection and implementation stages. This process is mainly considered as bureaucratic re-orientation process; therefore, the administering agency is now required to give up some of the powers of control it had enjoyed in the past.

- **5. Passive Participation:** It is form of announcement made by the administering agency without listening to the voice and opinion of the people. People participate by being informed what is going to happen or what has already happened. Hence, it is considered to be passive participation.
- **6. Participation by Consultation:** People tend to participate in the process when consulted. But the developmental agency has no obligation here to consult with the people and listen to their opinion. This form is known as participation by consultation.
- **7. Functional Participation:** People participate by forming groups to attain already predetermined objectives with relation to the project. But these institutions tend to be dependent on other external indicators and facilitators, but may become self-reliant in the future. This form is known as functional participation.
- **8. Institutional Participation:** Participation by the people is through already established institutions such as the *panchayats*, cooperatives, etc. Therefore, this form is known as institutional participation.
- **9. Participation in Information-giving:** People participate by answering questions and queries posed by the experts or the officials. In this case, the people do not have opportunity to influence the proceedings, this form is, therefore, called as participation in information-giving.
- **10. Participation for Material Incentives (As Contribution):** Here, people participate by providing material resources such as labour, etc. in return for material incentives. Their role ends when the material incentive ceases, and hence they have no influence over the process. This form is called as participation for material incentives.
- **11. Interactive Participation:** People actively take part in the joint analysis, this leads to formation of action plans and new local institutions or strengthening of existing ones. These groups take control of the local decision-making and hence, the people themselves have a stake in maintaining the structures and practices. This form is called as interactive participation.

- **12. Self-mobilization Participation:** The participation is carried out independent and without the influence of any external agency. They develop contacts with the external agencies for the resources and technical advice they need, but retain control over the use of resources. This type is called as self-mobilization participation.
- **13. Participation as Partnership:** The emphasis made here is on the developing skills and abilities that enable the beneficiaries to manage their resources in a better manner. The beneficiaries would also have a say in negotiating the existing service delivery systems. This form is known as participation as partnership.
- **14. Participation as Empowering:** Here the beneficiaries are enabled to decide upon and take action which they consider as essential to their development. This is essentially a political process and the beneficiaries in this case would enjoy the maximum voice compared to any other form of participation. This type of participation is known as Participation as Empowering.
- **15. Instrumental Participation:** The local people participate in the project of outsiders in order to achieve specific targets of results. This form is known as instrumental participation.
- **16. Transformation Participation:** The participation is viewed as an objective in itself and as a means of achieving higher ends such as sustainability or self-help. This type is known as transformation participation.
- **17. Formal Participation:** The people are bestowed identical political rights and obligations which are common to all. This applies to all modern agrarian institutions created, recognized and supported by the state and its entities. This form is known as formal participation.
- **18. Non-Formal Participation:** Here, social norms play a major role. Age, genealogical position and culturally determined expressions determine the power and status inequalities. None of the institutions or the organizations exhibit dominance form of participation, although it appears that they have considerable influence in smaller groups based on spontaneous participation. This kind is known as non-formal participation.
  - **(i)** Spontaneous Participation: Where people come forward on their own without any influence of external force or support.
  - **(ii)** Sponsored Participation: Where people participate because of some official authorization or mandate.
  - **(iii)** Compulsory Participation: It is coercive type, whereby the people participate because it has been made compulsory.

Out of the above-mentioned three types, the compulsory form is desirable for a democratic country like India. Maximum participation is seen in the sponsored type, where people receive some incentive in form of financial assistance, etc. from the government to participate. However, this type escalates the cost of the development programme as considerable amount will be spent for providing incentives to the people. Spontaneous participation is the most suitable, in the sense that, people themselves get involved and sustain the development programme for longer period of time and also help to establish an ideal cooperative and participatory situation for effective execution of the development programmes in their areas.

According to Cohen and Uphaff, (Uphoff, Norman, 'Approaches to community participation in Agricultural and Rural Development', 'Economic Development Institute of World Bank' Course note by Coordination and Development Administration Division, March, 1989, p.1), there are four important kinds of participation, which are:

- (i) Participation in decision-making: It focuses on identifying problems, formulating alternatives, planning activities, allocating resources, etc.
- (ii) Participation in implementation: The emphasis on carrying out activities, managing and operating programmes, partaking of services.
- (iii) Participation for benefits: Participation in economic, social, political, cultural or other benefits, individually or collectively.
- (iv) Participation in evaluation: Participation in evaluation of the activity and its outcomes, which should give feedback into above all three types of participation.

## **Benefits of People's Participation in Administration**

The benefits of people's participation in administration are as follows:

- **1.** It helps in selection of project which is directly relevant to the people.
- **2.** It reduces the financial burden on the government by making the program function even after the removal of its support, with help of local resources provided by the beneficiary people themselves.
- **3.** It acts as a safeguard against the abuse of authority of administration and thus, reduces the scope of corruption.

- **4.** It makes the local people bear and accept the developmental change and other issues associated with such change.
- **5.** It promotes the concept of *esprit de corps* among the people in the community and thus, strengthens the democracy at the grass root level.
- **6.** A wealth of information is provided to the administration regarding the local economic, sociocultural, ecological and technical conditions. This information is highly useful in the process of programming, planning, and implementation of the development programmes.
- **7.** It increases the capability and competence of the people to take up responsibility and solve the problems on their own. It develops the spirit of self-reliance, leadership and initiative among the people.
- **8.** It helps in the facilitation of mobilization of local resources in the form of labour, cash, and materials, etc., which are essential for the successful implementation of the program.
- **9.** It helps in prevention of hijacking of the projects by the richer and powerful sections of the society, as there is involvement of all section, especially the poor and weaker section in the development process. Thus, it leads to equitable sharing and distribution of the benefits in the society

## **Factors Affecting People's Participation**

However, there are number of factors which act as impediment for effective participation of the people in the administration. These are:

- **(i)** Negative political involvement and interference
- **(ii)** Improper administrative procedure
- **(iii)** Lack of culture of participation
- **(iv)** Aristocratic and mechanical bureaucracy
- **(v)** Role played by the middle men
- **(vi)** Time constraints, that is, time-bound nature of the activities
- **(vii)** Unfavourable socio-economic environment like presence of communalism, casteism, regionalism, illiteracy and poverty, etc.
- **(viii)** Presence of corruption and low standards of conduct in administration.

## **Voluntary Organizations**

Several voluntary organizations were started in the field of education, health, etc., in the early 19th and 20th centuries. The NGOs role became prominent after the independence, especially after 1970s. This can be attributed to the limited past success of the development policies pursued by the government. Despite half a century of development efforts initiated by the government, the problems of poverty, hunger, malnutrition, unemployment, illiteracy, gender inequality still persist and continue to plague our society. One of the important factors that limited the success of these programmes were the lack of participation and involvement of the people for whom these programmes were meant. Therefore, the involvement of people in the development programmes as micromanagement strategies, especially in the policy formulation, implementation and its evaluation is stressed in various quarters.

NGOs are considered by development practitioners, government and foreign donors to be more flexible, innovative and participatory and more successful in reaching out to the grass roots of the society and help in poverty alleviation. This has resulted in rapid growth of the NGOs involved in initiating and implementing of the development programmes.

There are thousands of Voluntary Organizations (VOs) spread across India. There are several areas of concern which were identified by the Ministry of Social Justice and Welfare, importantly delayed disbursement and poor service delivery on the ground. The challenge before the ministry was therefore, was to ensure streamlining the functioning of the VOs, so that only the right kind of organizations got the funding and effective service are rendered to the target group identified. And while these amounts are disbursed, care is also taken that the unserved areas in the country care covered and their voice heard, full use of the budgetary allocation of the funds is targeted and achieved.

## **Difference between Voluntary Organizations and Non-Governmental Organizations**

**Voluntary Organizations (VOs):** Voluntary organizations are opposite to business and trade associations. They are essentially non-profit and non-partisan organizations. They are generally independent of the government and are characterized by their social service motive rather than profit-making motives. The fundamental spirit that drives the VOs is voluntarism and it develops from varied sources such as charity, welfare of the needy, love for humanity, etc. These organizations are controlled by motivated and spirited private citizens and not by the state.

**NGOs:** The term Non-Governmental Organization has received widespread recognition internationally. The United Nations refers to NGO as any international organization not established by intergovernmental agreement including acceptance or appointment of members designated by governmental authorities, and such membership should not interfere with the organization's free expression of views. NGOs are different from the organs of the state and from those established by the market forces. They are therefore, formal organs which exist beyond the government and the market, and they run on the voluntary contributions made by the members of the society. In India, the term NGO is used to refer to wide spectrum of organizations which may be non-governmental, voluntary or nonvoluntary, quasi or semi-governmental, formal or informal, partisan or non-partisan, non-profit or profit-oriented bodies, with a legal status and registered under special acts such as Companies Act, Societies Act. To be eligible for funding purpose, such organizations should be a legal entity and thus, possess legal status.

| Voluntary Organization                                                           | Non-Governmental<br>Organization                                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Appointment of the staff is<br>carried out by the govern<br>ing board.           | It is generally made by the<br>members.                                                     |
| Salary is also determined<br>by the governing board.                             | Salary is determined by the<br>members.                                                     |

| Funded mainly by agencies<br>outside the government.                             | Receives funding from both<br>external agencies and the<br>government.                      |
| They do not have affiliation<br>of the trade union nor the<br>political parties. | They can be unionized<br>and politicized outside the<br>sphere of the government.           |

#### **Functions of the Voluntary Organizations**

The voluntary agencies are in search to identify new or unmet needs and help achieve them through their own innovative methods. They create public opinion and if required, get the state to act. They can play meaningful role in three ways:

- Build models, experiment with new and innovative programmes.
- Represent the rural local population by identifying with their needs and requirements.
- To catalyse the rural population towards the developmental approach.

The VOs are supposedly superior to the official agencies in three aspects:

- They can have a better rapport with the rural local population than the government officials.
- Since they are more flexible and not bound by bureaucratic set-up, they can realign their strategy and adjust to the need and requirement of the people.
- The people associated with the VOs are more devoted to serve the needs of the people than that of the government officials.

The following are some of the areas where the VOs played important role:

- Striving for the betterment and welfare of the *Harijan* families, and help to stop their exploitation and humiliation.
- Spearheading anti-dowry campaign.
- Rehabilitation of bonded labourers.
- Arranging proper wages and ending exploitation of the bonded labourers, etc.

The other important and unique function of the VOs are extension method and training which are discussed as follows:

## **Extension Method and Training**

Extension method is one of the important aspects of rural development experiments among the voluntary organizations. It facilitates the diffusion of the results of 'science and technology' among the rural population. Its uniqueness lies in the showing of scientific results at the doorsteps or in the living environment of the rural population. This method is identified with agriculture, health, rural industries and nutrition. Significant changes have been seen in the agricultural practices of the small and marginal farmers in terms of crop diversification, cattle rearing, irrigation uses and non-conventional energy utilization, etc.

Training is also one of the important functions of the VOs. The VOs have made use of training as an important input in rural development. Training help in development of functionaries involved in the rural development and reconstruction work or for augmentation of the technical skills and knowledge for generating selfemployment. During the early stages of the implementation of the Community Development Programme of the government, the initial training to the functionaries were given at the voluntary organizations such as the Gandhi Gram Trust and Kasturba Trust. In states such as Maharashtra the training to the *panchayat* functionaries have been entrusted with the voluntary organizations.

## **Shortcomings of the Voluntary Organizations**

The voluntary organizations can do little in the area of development that requires massive action in terms of human capital and financial resources. In a country like India, the VOs can play only a minor role, some of its shortcomings are as follows:

- They do not get proper support neither from the bureaucracy nor from other local leaders.
- Lack of inadequate funds.
- Lack of professionalism, the VOs lack trained man power to work in specific sectors and specialized areas.
- The VOs which are dominated by charismatic leaders tend to decline when such leaders leave the organization.
- They face organized opposition from the rich and powerful. This generally happens with the urban and rural elite who consider the VOs pose threat to their position of power.
- The number of VOs actively engaged in the rural redevelopment is less and very limited.
- The territorial development of the VOs has not been uniform. Most of the organizations are restricted to the Eastern and Western regions.
- The functioning of the organizations at the local level lack national awareness and their influence on the government is insignificant.

## **Suggestions to Promote Voluntary Efforts**

Some of the suggestions to promote voluntary efforts are as follows:

- The system of grant-in-aid should be streamlined and simplified. These grants should be delivered in a timely manner as any delay causes problem of effective provision of service and functioning of the staff.
- There should be drastic change in the attitudes and dealing of the bureaucracy with the VOs.
- The grants-in-aids programme should be widely publicized among the VOs and they should be assisted in applying for such grants as many of them have only little experience in applying for the grants.
- The political leaders should sincerely promote the voluntary efforts. Apart from this, the industrialists, professionals and the academic community should give their commitment in this regard. This will help to resolve the rural development problems in a timely manner.
- Programmes of the VOs should be documented and widely publicized so that the people are in a better position to assess such programmes. This would also serve as materials for others to follow.

- A clear-cut training policy should be devised by the VOs, as motivation alone is not enough. Professional approach always helps in better achievement of the results.
- Voluntary agencies should be created in all areas, and promotion of new agency should be carried out in areas where the VOs are non-existent.
- There should also be wider cooperation and coordination among different VOs so as to avoid duplication of services. A coordinating council for the VOs will help in providing a platform for collaboration and cooperation. Such a council can help to take up the issues to the government.
- The VOs should take conscious effort to improve their own organizational set-up and administrative competence, including audit of the accounts and housekeeping. They should not only develop competence in problem-solving but also develop skills in promoting development, sensitizing people and building-up of the capacity of the community for problem-solving and sustainable development.

## **NGOs and Women Empowerment**

The participation of women in NGOs have given them an opportunity to enter into the social and political spheres which were not easily available for them in the public or even in the government. Many of the NGOs that are working to alleviate poverty among the women also focus on upholding women rights. These measures have brought significant changes in the life of the women. NGOs also play a vital role in enforcement of the rights of the women as provided by the legislations and upheld in the Constitution of India.

#### **Empowering Women**

The Women Self-Help Groups (SHGs) have been now recognized as an effective strategy for empowerment of women, especially in the rural areas as they strive to bring together women from all walks of life to create a livelihood for them. SHGs also work on other variety of issues such as health, agriculture, forestry, nutrition, income generation activities, seeking of microcredit, etc.

The overall empowerment of women is fundamentally dependent on economic empowerment; therefore, NGOs are involved in the following activities to empower women:

• Supplement the effort taken by the government for the empowerment of women.

- Help to mobilize optimum resources for planning and implementing projects that have impact on women empowerment.
- Represent and articulate the problems faced by the rural women to the concerned officials and carry out social impact assessment of the policies that affect women.
- Educate and create cognizance among women, especially rural women.
- Promote the use of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for empowerment of women.
- Instil and develop leadership qualities among women and ensure that they participate in their empowerment process.

#### **Promoting Self-employment**

The NGOs also play an important and eloquent role in promoting self-employment of women in the following ways:

- **Legal Awareness and Property Rights:** NGOs work towards creating and developing awareness about the legal rights of women. These NGOs also provide loan facilities for the women groups to carry out business.
- **Credit/Microcredit:** Provision of credit provides way for empowerment of women. NGOs help the women self-help groups as they are better re-payers of the loan.
- **Fair Trade:** It is about giving the poor people power over their lives. NGOs help the involvement of the middlemen and ensure that the women groups get fair price for their work. They act as facilitators in this process.
- **Training and Skill Development:** The NGOs train the women and provide them with opportunities of self-employment which will help them to enhance their social and economic status. They also create and develop the habit of thrift and credit among the women in order to improve their quality of life.
- **Capacity Building:** NGOs also help in the capacity building of women whereby they can be effectively empowered. They are equipped with information, technology, training, knowledge and managerial techniques.

## **Way Forward**

Despite the efforts made by the NGOs the ground reality is not that encouraging as many women are not yet empowered fully and do not have any power or freedom to take decisions on their own. Still a lot more needs to be done. NGOs can only supplement the efforts made by the government, and hence the efforts of the government should be maximum.

The government should therefore, support the efforts taken by the NGOs. The government should provide resources such as training facilities and other mentoring services which help in the sustenance of the NGOs. Establishment of more NGOs will help in the cause of empowerment of women.

Overall, the NGOs have played significant role in bringing drastic changes in the life of women. They are successful in making the women independent and selfreliant and help them to take decisions on their own. They have also contributed in raising the literacy level and health of women.

In order to create and promote gender equality, the NGOs should continue their work to further the cause of women in all walks of life in all areas like social, economic, educational, etc. unless these concerns are addressed women empowerment will continue to be elusive. The NGOs does have the potential to bring about changes that can bring about significant changes that can effectively empower women and change their status in the society.

#### **NGOs and Youth**

The National Youth Policy, 2014 envisions a productive workforce which is to be achieved through education, skill training and entrepreneurship; sports as way of life and a healthy generation; increased participation in the governance; strong social values and a sense of community service; and bringing social inclusiveness by creating equitable opportunity for all.

The vast human resources require infrastructure that would bring transformation in the socio-economic scenario and technological advances. There is enough scope to maximize the contribution of the youth towards nation building through new and innovative ideas and strong motivation.

Every nation needs energetic youth who are capable to take on new challenges with high motivation and active participation in all programmes. Youth are considered to be the important manpower to build the nation.

There is need of appropriate policy framework to guide the youth in tasks of rural and urban development which would promote national development and socio-economic progress. They can be utilized to create an environment which is free from discrimination and exploitation and help to build the nation in the path of growth and sustainable development. They can be involved at the grass roots level to promote local development and self-governance, they can be made part of the *panchayati raj* institutions (PRIs) and Urban Development Plans and other various programmes. Thus, Indian youth should be made, part in development process whereby they participate in all capacities at all the levels.

Proper training and orientation towards nation building should be given to them so that their skills are effectively utilized. It has also been suggested by policy-makers to involve the youth in every part possible in order to bring changes and rural redevelopment. By developing such skills and enhancing their technical abilities, the youth can be part of the re-governance process whereby governance can be taken to the doorsteps of the people, especially those in the rural areas and slums, who were till now in the shadows of development programmes. Some of the other important role that can be played by the youth are that, they can be made part of the NGOs and voluntary organizations, they will help them to work in the field level and connect directly with the people. Some of the areas that can be covered are as follows:

- Involvement in various governmental programmes of the youth through the NGOs.
- Need to take-up and face the challenges.
- Training and orientation to be received in all fields including the present developing technology.
- Volunteering in nation building activities.
- Participation in various developmental activities through the *Panchayati raj* institutions and urban development programmes and plans.

#### **NGOs and Environment**

All environmental issues are important for the survival of mankind. The NGOs have played important role in both development and conservation activities. At the micro or community level the NGOs provide assistance in identifying the need and requirements of the people, they also help in identifying the issues, raise awareness and help to articulate the problems suffered by these communities. These are generally brought to the attention of the authorities concerned. They also help in capacity building of these communities whereby they can manage and self-sustain their resources and effectively deal with the concerns of sustainable development.

At macro or national level, the NGOs mainly focus on the policy work. They play a significant role in identifying the lacunae and weaknesses in the current policy framework, and help in effective information gathering and educating the general public, the government officials, those related to the private industries. They also help to organize protests and movements against certain policy decisions, so that effective changes are made and people's voice are heard by those who formulate such policies.

## **Issues Dealt by the NGOs**

The following are the various issues which are dealt by the NGOs:

- Reduction of waste in all forms.
- Efficient utilization of the natural resources.
- Environment-oriented sustainable development.
- How to integrate the interests of the rural poor into the international negotiation so that their concerns are also addressed.
- Integrate the local knowledge and involve local people to effectively manage the natural resource.
- Developing of support system whereby the small-scale manufacturers can switch from using more conventional form of energy to more environmentally friendly methods.
- Transforming the economic activities and integrating it with the global process to reduce conflicts over the access of natural resources.
- Large-scale adoption of the renewable energy technologies.
- Efficient utilization of the technologies.
- Access the environmental impact and scope for change of the activities carried out by the rural local people.
- Access how negative environment impact can be mitigated and how small producers can be effectively integrated with the global process with lesser impact to the environment.

## **Role Played by the NGOs**

The principle role of NGOs is to act like catalyst to bring changes in the local and national level and help in initiating community participation and achieve overall improvement in quality of life. These organizations help the government to receive valuable information for promoting, facilitating and implementing programmes and policies relating to the environment conservation and protection. Some of the other role of the NGOs are as follows:

- Enhance people's participation in the governmental programmes.
- Disseminating of information through newsletters, articles, audio and visual mediums, etc.

- The main mission is to engage people to promote sustainable use of the resources and effective protection of the environment.

## **The Need for Code of Ethics for the NGOs**

Ever since the NGOs have assumed an important and indispensable role in the developmental process and governance, which they have achieved through appropriate identification of needs and effective implementation of development programmes, they have been subject to criticism. And these generally centres on the funds received and utilized by the NGOs. Major chunk of the NGOs relies on the financial assistance from the foreign donor agencies. Mishandling and swindling of the money are the frequent complaints raised. Some of these NGOs are alleged to have maintained links with foreign donors to finance programs which are outside their main objectives; some others are criticized for involving in destabilizing practices and thus, posing threat to the unity of the country. And, many of the NGOs are alleged to serve particular interest of a community and thus, developing sectarian ideals and disrupting the very social fabric of the society.

The demand is, therefore, for a complete overhaul of the voluntary sector. Some well-known NGOs and voluntary organizations have come together and initiated a dialogue on developing a set of norms to monitor the activities of the NGOs. A national council in the name of Voluntary Council of India, was to be set-up through a bill in order to monitor and enforce a code of ethics for the NGOs. A draft code of conduct was prepared whereby the voluntary organizations were required to hold general meetings regularly, audit their accounts and submit the same to the authorities, and those organizations receiving foreign funding have to get themselves registered with the Minister of Home Affairs under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 1976.

#### **Some Positive Provisions in the Code**

The code prescribes high standard of integrity for both paid and unpaid workers. Funds of an organization should not be misused or misappropriated by individuals for their personal purposes. The code also requires the voluntary workers to lead a simple life, there should not be any disparity between their standard of living and emoluments of received by them. They are also required to disclose their assets every year. The code also expects the NGOs not to promote business, commercial and political interests of their office-holders. The code also prohibits voluntary workers from assuming power in a political party, and persons holding an elective office in Parliament, a state legislature, or *panchayati raj* institutions cannot be members of the voluntary organizations. When a person wants to stand in an election, he/she should resign from the voluntary organization.

The code also makes in obligatory from the rural NGOs to have a base in the rural areas. The working method should be simple, innovative and inexpensive, and the workers should show dedication and professional competence.

Many though disagree on the authority entrusted with the monitoring of the rural NGOs. While many agree on the need for a code of conduct applicable to all voluntary organizations, many have not endorsed the code completely. There is general agreement that it would serve the purpose of preventing anti-NGO activities in the country. It is generally understood that some of the NGOs are working against the very ideals of voluntary social service. At present NGOs have become closed entities and have become opaque. They have ceased to be effective and innovative. Autonomy has been exchanged for money received.

#### **Opposition Against the Code**

The foreign funds have to be declared and is subject to control under FCRA, and the code compels individuals not to use to funds for their personal ends and necessitates for them to declare their assets every year. But this portion has not received support from many. The counterargument presented is that, there is no check on the corruption and money swindled by the politicians and the bureaucrats. But the NGOs at least mobilize resources and contribute their service for the betterment of the society. Therefore, they argue that regulation or control of funds is not needed.

The NGOs have also not accepted the provision that they should not assume membership or position in any political party. It is common knowledge that NGOs serve as hotbed of ideologies. People associate themselves with NGOs that matches with their ideology, it helps to achieve their cherished ideals. Take for example Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad (KSSP), it is an NGO popularizing scientific knowledge in a simple form accessible to the common man. Hence, it has attracted volunteers from diverse background such as from the teaching community, students' groups and government employees. This NGO KSSP, being a Marxist inspired organization, draws people with similar ideology to its fold. A large share of its members belongs to this group and some of them hold responsible position in the left-wing parties in Kerala.

The opposition was strong against settling of the council both at the state and national levels. The proposed national council will wield power to prescribe the code of ethics and to protect the interests, rights and privileges of the voluntary agencies. The councils at both national and state level, can based on complaints received or *suo moto* can investigate corruptions, mismanagement, financial lapses or infringement of code of ethics by the NGOs and can impose its findings in any matter investigated by it. It can also investigate against the government departments and offices, government-controlled bodies, universities, autonomous bodies, *panchayats* and *zila* parishads, etc., based on the complaints given by the NGOs in case of delay, obstruction, discrimination, acts of harassment etc. insofar as they affect the functioning of the voluntary agencies.

It is generally understood that government investigation against the voluntary agency is easier than investigation of complaints against government departments and its officials. It is also feared that the complaints by the NGOs against the government departments, officers will further strain the NGO-government relationship. Experiences of many NGOs is that the government skilfully justifies its lapses and failures. The voluntary agencies are also more sceptical about the role played by the council, which circumvents delayed action and harassment by the government. More often, it is difficult to proceed against the erring government official and bureaucrats, whereas the council will not face any such difficulty in proceeding against the voluntary organizations.

#### **Way Forward**

A code of ethics is welcomed by many NGOs and voluntary agencies, as it helps them to set and follow a standard for themselves and to remove any kind of allegations raised against them. NGOs are viewed with suspicion and it has become common belief that voluntary agencies attract considerable foreign funds which are not utilized properly. This has damaged the image of well-intentioned NGOs and tarnished the name of entire voluntary sector. On the other hand, it is also true that some NGO leaders live a lavish lifestyle. And they fear that such a code of ethics will force them to give up such lifestyle and make them accountable to the community and to their organizations. On the other side, there is real threat about the code that would sound death knell to the autonomy of the NGOs and increate interference of outside agencies such as the government in their functioning.

Like, self-help which is the considered to be the crucial role of voluntary agencies, self-discipline also matters in relation to management of funds and commitment to people and the community for whom they work. Regular interference by third-party including the government will kill the spirit of voluntarism. Thus, there needs to balance, whereby the voluntary agencies are functioning autonomously without any hindrance and they are also monitored and their funds audited in a transparent manner. In this way the spirit of voluntarism can be upheld and people's confidence in the NGOs will also increase.

## **The following is the World Bank report, which described four categories of people's participation for different kinds of programs.**

There four categories are as follows:

- 1. Information Sharing: Service providers like the project designers and managers inform the local people in order to facilitate action by them. Information helps the locals to understand and perform their tasks better. In family planning and nutritional programs, such information sharing works better.
- 2. Consultation: The local people are consulted at every, or key stage in a project cycle. There is opportunity for the people here to interact and provide feedback to the service providers which could be included in the design and implementation stages. If the farmers are consulted during the extension programs and arrangements, the project outcomes are likely to be better than that when they were merely informed.
- 3. Decision-making: This happens when the beneficiaries have a decision-making role in matters of program design and implementation. Decisions can be made jointly with the service providers on certain issues related to the project. Thus, slum dwellers may be involved in the process of upgrading their house together with the project staff on the design.
- 4. Initiating Action: In this category the beneficiaries are able to take initiative in terms of actions/decisions pertaining to the project. This implies a proactive capacity and confidence to get the services on their own. The beneficiary group identify a new need and decide to respond on their own; they are thus, taking initiative for their own development.

## **The following are the various stages of people's participation as identified by number of studies and scholars**

- 1. As per the International Association of People's Participation:
  - a. Inform: One-way communication
  - b. Consult: Two-way communication
  - c. Involve: Participatory process
  - d. Collaborate: Partnership
  - e. Empower: Implementing what public decides
- 2. A metaphoric eight rung ladder of participation as developed by Arnstein.
  - a. Manipulation
  - b. Therapy
  - c. Informing
  - d. Consultation
  - e. Placation

- f. Partnership
- g. Delegated power
- h. Citizen control
- 3. A study carried out by Wilcox identified the following five stages:
  - a. Informing
  - b. Consulting
  - c. Deciding together
  - d. Acting together
  - e. Supporting independent community interests

## **Effective Participation for Good Governance**

- • The two major aspects of developing social capital are social norms and trust which help people in networking with each other.
- • People share values, concerns with help of such networks, and this consequently transforms into group energy.
- • This group energy then helps to hold the local authority accountable for delivering of services and development.
- • In this way social capital can be used to achieve good governance.
- • Both the people and the governing agencies should act mutually to develop trust and norms, that is, social capital.
- • Effective participation in a society is not possible if its normative values are not adhered to.
- • Local stakeholders those who are in networks with the social capital, have to be included in consultations for the development of policies of the government that can ensure effective participation of the people.

## **Citizen and Administration**

Welfare orientation is the characteristic of a modern democratic state. Hence, the government has come to play a significant role in socio-economic development of the nation. This, thus, has resulted in the expansion and growth of the bureaucracy and multiplication of the administrative process, which has resulted in increased administrative discretion and power enjoyed by the civil servants at various levels of government. Such discretionary power might result in harassment, malpractices, maladministration and corruption.

Hence, such a situation gives raise to citizen's grievances against the administration. The success of a democracy and realization of socio-economic development lies in the fact that grievances of the citizens are addressed effectively. Hence, the following institutions have been created across the world in order to effectively address the citizen's grievances, they are:

- The Ombudsman system
- The administrative courts system
- The procurator system

The Scandinavian Ombudsman is the earliest of the institution in the world which was created to address the grievance of the citizens. Ombudsman is called to be a unique institution which is appropriate for dealing with the complaints of ordinary citizens about the unfair actions taken by the administration.

#### **Ombudsman System**

The first institution of Ombudsman was created in Sweden in 1809. The term '*Ombud'* is of Swedish origin, which refer to a person who acts as a representative of another person. The Ombudsman also refers to an officer who is appointed by the legislature to handle complaints against the administrators and the judiciary.

The following matters are dealt by the Swedish Ombudsman:

- Maladministration, that is, inefficiency in achieving the targets.
- Nepotism, supporting one's own kith and kin for employment and various other purpose.
- Administrative discretion is abused, official power and authority is misused.
- Discourtesy, use of abusive language and misbehaving with the people.
- Corruption in administration, asking for bribe for doing official work.

This Ombudsman is appointed for a term of four years by the Parliament. He can only be removed by the Parliament on the grounds of loss of confidence in him. The annual report is submitted to the Parliament hence, he is also termed as 'Parliamentary Ombudsman'. But he is independent of all the three institutions of legislature, executive and the judiciary.

It is a constitutional authority, which enjoy power to supervise the compliance of rules and regulations, by the administrators, and verify whether they are performing their job properly. Hence, in other words, we can say that the Ombudsman keep a watch over the civil, judicial, military officials so that they function objectively, impartially and legally in accordance with the law of the land. But he does not have the power to reverse or quash a decision and he has no direct control over the administration and the judiciary.

The Ombudsman acts either on the complaints received from the citizen or on its own, that is, *suo motu*. He has the power to persecute any official, including the judges. But he has no power to impose any punishment. He can report to the higher authorities to take necessary action against the erring officials. The following thus, are the characteristics of the Swedish Ombudsman:

- Impartial and unbiased inquiry into the complaints received.
- Unlimited and uninterrupted to all files related to administration.
- A very wide publicity is given for its functioning in the media.
- It has *suo motu* power to initiate investigation.
- It is a very direct, cheap, informal and speedy method of handling the complaints.
- Its action is independent from the executive.
- The report is submitted to the Parliament and not the executive. The institution of Ombudsman is based on doctrine of administrative accountability to the legislature.

From Sweden this institution spread to other Scandinavian countries—Finland (1919), Denmark (1955) and finally Norway (1962). The country of New Zealand was the first from the Commonwealth nations to adopt this system in form of appointment of a Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration in 1967. And nearly 40 countries have adopted this system of Ombudsman in one form or other with different nomenclature and functions. In India, this system is called as *Lokpal* and *Lokayukta*.

The system of Ombudsman is called as the bulwark against the official tyranny by the democratic government. It is also descried as the institutionalized public conscience.

The administrative courts which was first developed in France, also acts as an important instrument for redressal of grievances of the citizens. Because of its successful functioning in France, this system has been adopted in number of countries around the world, such as in European countries like Belgium, Greece, etc., and other African countries etc.

The socialist countries like the former USSR, Hungary, China, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania etc. operated the procurator system and this was used to address the grievances of the citizens. This system of procurator is still operational in Russia and he is appointed to the office for a tenure of seven years.

#### **Institutions in India**

The following are the existing legal and institutional framework to address the grievances of citizen's in India.

- Special Police Establishment, 1941
- Delhi Police Establishment Act, 1946

- Central Bureau of Investigation, 1963
- State Vigilance Commission, 1964
