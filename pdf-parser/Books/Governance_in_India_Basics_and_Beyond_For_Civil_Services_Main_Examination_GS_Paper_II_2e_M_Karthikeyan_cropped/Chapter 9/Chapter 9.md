# FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS REGARDING INDIAN ELECTION

The following are the fundamental bases which are important in order to understand the electoral system in the country. The Representation of the People's Act deals with all the points mentioned in the following list, and understanding these fundamentals will better help the readers grasp its provisions.

- ➢ Criminalisation of Politics
- $\triangleright$  Flectoral Reforms
- Recent Landmark Judgments of the Supreme Court

# **Indian Election Scenario**

India is a constitutional democracy with a parliamentary system of Government, and at the heart of the system is a commitment to hold regular, free and fair elections. These elections determine the composition of the Government, the membership of the two houses of Parliament, the State and Union Territory legislative assemblies, and the Presidency and Vice Presidency

Elections are conducted according to the constitutional provisions, supplemented by laws made by the Parliament. The major laws are Representation of the People Act, 1950, which mainly deals with the preparation and revision of electoral rolls; and the Representation of the People Act, 1951 which deals, in detail, with all aspects of conduct of elections and post-election disputes. The Supreme Court of India has held that where the enacted laws are silent or make insufficient provision to deal with a given situation in the conduct of elections, the Election Commission has the residuary powers under the Constitution to act in an appropriate manner.

#### **Indian Elections – Scale of Operation**

Elections in India are events involving political mobilisation and organisational complexity on an amazing scale. In the 2004 election to Lok Sabha there were 1351 candidates from six National parties, 801 candidates from 36 State parties, 898 candidates from officially recognised parties and 2385 independent candidates. A total number of 38,99,48,330 people voted out of total electorate size of 67,14,87,930. The Election Commission employed almost 4 million people to run the election. A vast number of civilian police and security forces were deployed to ensure that the elections were carried out peacefully.

Conduct of General elections in India for electing a new Lower House of Parliament (Lok Sabha) involves management of the largest event in the world. The electorate exceeds 670 million electors in about 7,00,000 polling stations spread across widely varying geographic and climatic zones. Polling stations are located in the snowclad mountains in the Himalayas, the deserts of the Rajasthan and in sparsely populated islands in the Indian Ocean.

# **Constituencies and Reservation of Seats**

The country has been divided into 543 parliamentary Constituencies, each of which sends one MP to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament. The size and shape of the parliamentary constituencies are determined by an independent Delimitation Commission, which aims to create constituencies which have roughly the same population, subject to geographical considerations and the boundaries of the states and administrative areas.

#### **How Constituency Boundaries are Drawn Up?**

Delimitation is the redrawing of the boundaries of parliamentary or assembly constituencies to make sure that there are, as near as practicable, the same number of people in each constituency. In India boundaries are meant to be examined after the ten-year census to reflect changes in population, for which Parliament by law establishes an independent Delimitation Commission, made up of the Chief Election Commissioner and two judges or ex-judges from the Supreme Court or High Court. However, under a constitutional amendment of 1976, delimitation was suspended until after the census of 2001, ostensibly so that state' family-planning programs would not affect their political representation in the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabhas. This has led to wide discrepancies in the size of constituencies, with the largest having over 25,00,000 electors, and the smallest less than 50,000. Delimitation exercise, with 2001 census data released on 31st December 2003, has been completed.

#### **Reservation of Seats**

The Constitution puts a limit on the size of the Lok Sabha of 550 elected members, apart from two members who can be nominated by the President to represent the Anglo-Indian community. There are also provisions to ensure the representation of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, with reserved constituencies where only candidates from these communities can stand for election.

#### COMPONENTS OF CREDIBLE ELECTORAL DEMOCRACY

# **System of Election**

Elections to the Lok Sabha are carried out using a firstpast-the-post electoral system. The country is split up into separate geographical areas, known as constituencies, and the electors can cast one vote each for a candidate (although most candidates stand as independents, most successful candidates stand as members of political parties), the winner being the candidate who gets maximum votes.

# **Parliament**

The Parliament of the Union consists of the President, the Lok Sabha (House of People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States). The President is the head of the State, and he appoints the Prime Minister, who runs the Government, according to the political composition of the Lok Sabha. Although, the Government is headed by a Prime Minister, the Cabinet is the central decision making body of the Government. Members of more than one party can make up a Government, and although the governing parties may be a minority in the Lok Sabha, they can only govern as long as they have the confidence of a majority of MPs, the members of the Lok Sabha. As well as being the body, which determines whom, makes up the Government, the Lok Sabha is the main legislative body, along with the Rajya Sabha.

# **Rajya Sabha – The Council of the States**

The members of the Rajya Sabha are elected indirectly, rather than by the citizens at large. Rajya Sabha members are elected by each State Vidhan Sabha using the single transferable vote system. Unlike most federal systems where each state is represented by one or more members, in India, the number of members returned by each State is roughly in proportion to their population.

At present there are 233 members of the Rajya Sabha elected by the Vidhan Sabhas, and there are also twelve members nominated by the President as representatives of literature, science, art and social services. Rajya Sabha members can serve for six years, and elections are staggered, with one third of the assembly being elected every 2 years.

#### **Nominated Members**

The President can nominate two members of the Lok Sabha if it is felt that the representation of the Anglo-Indian community is inadequate, and 12 members of the Rajya Sabha, to represent literature, science, art and the social services.

#### **State Assemblies**

India is a federal country, and the Constitution gives the States and Union Territories significant control over their own Government. The Vidhan Sabhas (legislative assemblies) are directly elected bodies set up to carry out the administration of the Government in the 28 States of India. In some States there is a bicameral organisation of legislatures, with both an Upper and Lower House. Two of the seven Union Territories viz., the National Capital Territory of Delhi and Pondicherry, also have legislative assemblies.

Elections to the Vidhan Sabhas are carried out in the same manner as for the Lok Sabha election, with the States and Union Territories divided into single-member constituencies, and the first-past-the-post electoral system used. The assemblies range in size, according to population. The largest Vidhan Sabha is for Uttar Pradesh, with 403 members; the smallest Pondicherry, with 30 members.

#### **President and Vice President**

The President is elected by the elected members of the Vidhan Sabha, Lok Sabha, and Rajya Sabha, and serves for a period of 5 years (although they can stand for re-election). A formula is used to allocate votes so there is a balance between the population of each State and the number of votes assembly members from a State can cast, and to give an equal balance between State Assembly members and National Parliament members. If no candidate receives a majority of votes there is a system by which losing candidates are eliminated from the contest and votes for them transferred to other candidates, until one gains a majority. The Vice President is elected by a direct vote of all members elected and nominated, of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.

#### **Who Can Vote?**

The democratic system in India is based on the principle of universal adult suffrage; that any citizen over the age of 18 can vote in an election (before 1989 the age limit was 21). The right to vote is irrespective of caste, creed, religion or gender. Those who are deemed unsound of mind, and people convicted of certain criminal offences are not allowed to vote.

#### **The Electoral Roll**

The electoral roll is a list of all people in the constituency who are registered to vote in Indian Elections. Only those people with their names on the electoral roll are allowed to vote. The electoral roll is normally revised every year to add the names of those who are to turn 18 on the 1st January of that year or have moved into a constituency and to remove the names of those who have died or moved out of a constituency.

If one is eligible to vote and is not on the electoral roll, they can apply to the Electoral Registration Officer of the constituency, who will update the register. The updation of the Electoral Roll stops only during an election campaign, after the nominations for candidates are closed.

#### **Computerisation of Rolls**

In 1998 the Commission took a historic decision to computerize the entire electoral rolls of 620 million voters. This work has been completed and now well-printed electoral rolls are available. The photo identity card number of the voter has also been printed in the electoral rolls, for cross linking. The printed electoral rolls as well as CDs containing these rolls are available for sale to general public. National and State parties are provided these free of cost after every revision of electoral rolls. Entire country's rolls are also available on Election Commission's website.

#### **Electors' Photo Identity Cards**

In an attempt to improve the accuracy of the electoral roll and prevent electoral fraud, the Election Commission ordered the making of photo identity cards for all voters in the country in August 1993. To take advantage of latest technological innovations, the Commission issues revised guidelines for EPIC Program in May 2000. More than 450 million identity cards have been distributed till now.

Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC) is an identity document issued by the Electoral Registration Officer. The EPIC contains details of the elector like Name, Father's/ Mother's/Husband's Name, Date of Birth/Age on the qualifying date, Sex, Address and most importantly, the photograph of the elector. EPIC is a permanent document for an elector. It is to be used by the elector to establish one's identity at the time of polls. It is compulsory for an elector who has been issued an EPIC to produce the EPIC at the time of polling to enable voting.

Every EPIC is issued under a unique EPIC Number. EPIC Number is an alphanumeric string with 3 alphabetical codes followed by a seven-digit number. While the first 3 alphabetical codes, called the Functional Unique Serial Number (FUSN) code is unique for every Assembly Constituency and is provided by the Election Commission, the numeric code that follows the FUSN code is a six digit running serial number followed by one digit checksum making a total of seven digits

## **When Do Elections Take Place?**

Elections for the Lok Sabha and every State Legislative Assembly have to take place every five years, unless called earlier. The President can dissolve Lok Sabha and call a general election before five years is up, if the Government can no longer command the confidence of the Lok Sabha, and if there is no alternative Government available to take over.

Governments have found it increasingly difficult to stay in power for the full term of a Lok Sabha in recent times, and so elections have often been held before the five-year limit. A constitutional amendment passed in 1975, as part of the Government declared emergency, postponed the election due to be held in 1976. This amendment was later rescinded, and regular elections resumed in 1977.

Holding of regular elections can only be stopped by means of a constitutional amendment and in consultation with the Election Commission, and it is recognised that interruptions of regular elections are acceptable only in extraordinary circumstances.

## **Scheduling the Elections**

When the five-year limit is up, or the legislature has been dissolved and new elections have been called, the Election Commission puts into effect the machinery for holding an election. The constitution states that there can be no longer than 6 months between the last session of the dissolved Lok Sabha and the recalling of the new House, so elections have to be concluded before then.

In a country as huge and diverse as India, finding a period when elections can be held throughout the country is not simple.

The Election Commission, which decides the schedule for elections, has to take account of the weather – during winter constituencies may be snow-bound, and during the monsoon access to remote areas restricted, the agricultural cycle – so that the planting or harvesting crops is not disrupted, exam schedules – as schools are used as polling stations and teachers are employed as election officials, and religious festivals and public holidays. On top of this there are the logistical difficulties that go with holding an election – sending out ballot boxes or EVMs, setting up polling booths, recruiting officials to oversee the elections.

The Commission normally announces the schedule of the elections in a major press conference a few weeks before the formal process is set in motion. The Model Code of Conduct for guidance of candidates and political parties immediately comes into effect after such announcement. The formal process for the elections starts with the Notification or Notifications calling upon the electorate to elect members of a House. As soon as notifications are issued, candidates can start filling their nominations in the constituencies from where they wish to contest. These are scrutinised by the Returning Officer of the constituency concerned after the last date for the same is over after about a week. The nominated candidates can withdraw from the contest within two days from the date of scrutiny. Contesting candidates get at least two weeks for political campaign before the actual date of poll. On account of the vast magnitude of operations and the massive size of the electorate, polling is held at least on three days for the national elections. A separate date for counting is fixed and the results is declared for each constituency by the concerned Returning Officer. The Commission compiles the complete list of members elected and issues an appropriate notification for the due Constitution of the House. With this, the process of elections is complete and the President, in case of the Lok Sabha, and the Governors of the concerned States, in case of the State Legislatures, can then convene their respective Houses to hold their sessions. The entire process takes around 5 to 8 weeks for the national elections, 4 to 5 weeks for separate elections only for Legislative Assemblies.

#### **Candidates in Election**

Any Indian citizen who is registered as a voter and is over 25 years of age is allowed to contest elections to the Lok Sabha or State Legislative Assemblies. For the Rajya Sabha the age limit is 30 years.

Every candidate has to make a deposit of `10,000/- for Lok Sabha election and `5000 for Rajya Sabha or Vidhan Sabha elections, except for candidates from the SC and ST who pay half of these amounts. The deposit is returned if the candidate receives more than one-sixth of the total number of valid votes polled in the constituency. Nominations must be supported at least by one registered elector of the constituency, in the case of a candidate sponsored by a registered party and by ten registered electors from the constituency in the case of other candidates. Returning Officers, appointed by the Election Commission, are put in charge to receive nominations of candidates in each constituency, and oversee the formalities of the election.

#### **Number of Candidates**

The number of candidates contesting each election has steadily increased. In the general election of 1952 the average number of candidates in each constituency was 3.8; by 1991 it has risen to 16.3, and in 1996 stood at 25.6.

As it was far too easy for 'frivolous' candidates to stand for election, certain remedial measures were taken in August 1996, which included increasing the size of deposit and increasing the number of people who have to nominate a candidate. The impact of such measures was quite considerable at the elections which were subsequently held. As a result, in 1998 Lok Sabha elections, the number of candidates came down to an average of 8.74 per constituency. In 1999 Lok Sabha elections, it was 8.6, and in 2004 it was 10.

#### **Campaign**

The campaign is the period when the political parties put forward their candidates and arguments with which they hope to persuade people to vote for their candidates and parties. Candidates are given a week to put forward their nominations. These are scrutinised by the Returning Officers and if not found to be in order can be rejected after a summary hearing. Valid nominated candidates can withdraw their nominations within two days after their nominations have been scrutinised. The official campaign lasts at least two weeks from the drawing up of the list of nominated candidates, and officially ends 48 hours before polling closes.

During the election campaign, the political parties and contesting candidates are expected to abide by a Model Code of conduct evolved by the Election Commission on the basis of a consensus among political parties. The Model Code lays down broad guidelines as to how the political parties and candidates should conduct themselves during the election campaign. It is intended to maintain the election campaign on healthy lines, avoid clashes and conflicts between political parties or their supporters and ensure peace and order during the campaign period and thereafter, until the results are declared. The Model Code also prescribes guidelines for the ruling party either at the Centre or in the State to ensure that level field in maintained and that no cause is given for any complaint that the ruling party has used its officials position for the purposes of its election campaign.

Once an election has been called, parties issue manifestos detailing the programmes they wish to implement if elected to Government, the strengths of their leaders, and the failures of opposing parties and their leaders. Slogans are used to popularise and identify parties and issues, and pamphlets and posters are distributed to the electorate. Rallies and meetings where the candidates try to persuade, cajole and enthuse supporters, and denigrate opponents, are held throughout the constituencies. Personal appeals and promises of reform are made, with candidates travelling the length and breadth of the constituency to try to influence as many potential supporters as possible. Party symbols abound, are printed on posters and placards.

#### **Polling Days**

Polling is normally held on a number of different days in different constituencies, to enable the security forces and those monitoring the election to keep law and order and ensure that voting during the election is fair.

#### **Ballot Papers and Symbols**

After nomination of candidates is complete, a list of competing candidates is prepared by the Returning Officer, and ballot papers are printed. Ballot papers are printed with the names of the candidates (in languages set by the Election Commission) and the symbols allotted to each of the candidates. Candidates of recognised parties are allotted their party symbols.

#### **Voting**

Voting is done by secret ballot. Polling stations are usually set up in public institutions, such as schools and community halls. To enable as many electors as possible to vote, the officials of the Election Commission try to ensure that there is a polling station within 2 km of every voter, and that no polling stations should have to deal with more than 1500 voters. Each polling station is open for at least 8 hours on the day of the election.

Since 1998, the Commission has increasingly used Electronic Voting Machines instead of ballot boxes. In 2003, all State elections and byelections were held using EVMs. Encouraged by this, the Commission took a historic decision to use only EVMs for the Lok Sabha election due in 2004. More than 1 million EVMs were used in this election.

Political parties are an established part of modern mass democracy, and the conduct of elections in India is largely dependent on the behaviour of political parties. Although many candidates for Indian elections are independent, the winning candidates for Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections usually stand as members of political parties, and opinion polls suggest that people tend to vote for a party rather than a particular candidate. Parties offer candidates organisational support, and by offering a broader election campaign, looking at the record of Government and putting forward alternative proposals for government, help voters make a choice about how the Government is run.

# **Registration with Election Commission**

Political parties have to be registered with the Election Commission. The commission determines whether the party is structured and committed to the principles of democracy, secularism and socialism in accordance with the Indian Constitution and would uphold the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India. Parties are expected to hold organisational elections and have a written constitution.

# **Recognition and Reservation of Symbols**

According to certain criteria, set by the Election Commission regarding the length of political activity and success in elections, parties are categorised by the Commission as National or State parties, or simply declared registered – unrecognised parties. How a party is classified determines a party's right to certain privileges, such as access to electoral rolls and provision of time for political broadcasts on the state-owned television and radio stations – All India Radio and Doordarshan – and also the important question of allocation of the party symbol. Party symbols enable illiterate voters to identify the candidate of the party they wish to vote for. National parties are given a symbol that is for their use only, throughout the country. State parties have the sole use of a symbol in the State in which they are recognised as such registered-unrecognised parties can choose a symbol from a list of 'free' symbols.

# **Limit on Poll Expenses**

Amendment in October 2003 has increased expenses limits. For Lok Sabha seats in bigger States, it is `25,00,000. In other States and Union territories, it varies between `10,00,000 to `25,00,000. Similarly, for Assembly seats, in bigger states, it is `10,00,000, while in other States and Union Territories, it varies between `5,00,000 to `10,00,000.

Although supporters of a candidate can spend as much as they like to help out with a campaign, they have to get written permission of the candidate, and whilst parties are allowed to spend as much money on campaigns as they want, recent Supreme Court judgement have said that, unless a political party can specifically account for money spent during the campaign, it will consider any activities as being funded by the candidates and counting towards their election expenses. The accountability imposed on the candidates and parties has curtailed some of the more extravagant campaigning that was previously a part of Indian elections.

# **Free Campaign Time on State-Owned Electronic Media**

By Election Commission, all recognised National and State parties have been allowed free access to the state-owned electronic media – AIR and Doordarshan – on an extensive scale for their campaigns during elections. The total free time allocated extends over 122 hours on the state-owned television and radio channels. This is allocated equitably by combing a base limit and additional time linked to poll performance of the party.

# **Splits and Mergers and Anti-Defection Law**

Splits, mergers and alliances have frequently disrupted the compositions of political parties. This has led to a number of disputes over which section of a divided party gets to keep the party symbol, and how to classify the resulting parties in terms of national and State parties. The Election Commission has to resolve these disputes, although its decisions can be challenged in the courts.

# **Election Petitions**

Any elector or candidate can file an election petition if he or she thinks there has been malpractice during the election. An election petition is not an ordinary civil suit, but treated as a contest in which the whole constituency is involved. Election petitions are tried by the High Court of the State involved, and if upheld can even lead to the restaging of the election in that constituency.

# **Election Observers**

The Election Commission appoints a large number of observers to ensure that the campaign is conducted fairly, and that people are free to vote as they choose. Observers also keep a check on the amount that each candidate and party spends on the election.

#### **Counting of Votes**

After the polling is finished, the votes are counted under the supervision of Returning Officers and Observers appointed by the Election Commission. After the counting of votes is over, the Returning Officer declares the name of the candidate to whom the largest number of votes has been given as the winner, and as having been returned by the constituency to the concerned house.

#### **Media Coverage**

In order to bring as much transparency as possible to the electoral process, the media are encouraged and provided with facilities to cover the election, although subject to maintaining the secrecy of the vote. Media persons are given special passes to enter the polling stations to cover the poll process and the counting halls during the actual counting of votes.

## **Model Code of Conduct**

A visible and rigorous enforcement of Model Code of Conduct enhances the credibility of the elections and gives confidence to the stakeholders/voters. It is ensured that official machinery for the electoral purposes is not misused. It is also ensured that electoral offences, malpractices and corrupt practices such as impersonation, bribing and inducement of voters, threat and intimidation to the voters, is prevented by all means. Introduction of photo electoral roll by the Election Commission is expected to play a crucial role in minimising the scope for impersonation.

# **Vulnerability Mapping**

The threat and intimidation to the voters particularly, the voters from vulnerable sections of the society in some parts of the country has been a cause of concern. With a view to meet this challenge, the Commission has recently introduced the system of 'Vulnerability Mapping'. A free and fair election can be conducted only in a conducive atmosphere from the law and order point of view. Hence, it becomes imperative to keep track of the law and order situation during the run up to the election and on the poll day.

#### **Electronic Voting Machines**

The Electronic Voting Machine was used universally in all polling stations in the country during the Lok Sabha election 2004. However, the voter awareness about the EVM cannot be taken for granted. It is an endeavour of the Commission to spread the awareness about the EVM among all the voters particularly, in the remote areas and among the new voters. The Commission has introduced the system of randomisation of EVMs for allotment of EVMs to the polling stations and specific responsibility has been given to the Returning Officer. By the system, the firstlevel checking of EVMs are carried out only by BEL/ECIL Engineers, as the case may be, only at the District Headquarters. At this stage, the EVMs are randomised in the presence of representative of recognised political parties for distribution to Assembly Constituencies. The second randomisation of EVMs for allotting to specific polling stations is done in the presence of candidate or his election agent or authorised representative of the candidate and Election Commission's Observer.

#### Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail System (VVPAT)

The Election commission has introduced VVPAT system at selected polling stations and has ordered that a printer with drop box of such design, as may be approved by the Election Commission may also be attached to a voting machine for printing a paper tail of vote, in such constituency or constituencies or parts thereof as the Election commission may direct where printer for paper trial is used, the electors shall be able to view through the transparent window of the printer, the printed paper slip showing the serial number, name and the symbol of the candidate to whom he has cast his vote before such slips gets cut and drops in the drop box of the printer.

#### None of the Above: NOTA

The provision of NOTA option is an expression of decision not to vote for the contesting candidates. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in its judgments dated 27th September, 2013, in a writ Petition No 161 of 2004 directed that the Commission should make necessary provision in the ballot papers/EVM for 'None of the Above (NOTA)' option so that the electors who do not wish to vote for any of the candidates can exercise their right not to vote for any candidate without violation of the secrecy of their decision. A ballot panel with the words 'None of the Above: NOTA' will be available after the panel containing the name and particulars of the last candidate on the ballot paper. The electors who do not wish to vote for any of the candidate can exercise their right not to vote for any candidate without violation of the secrecy of their decision. For example, if there are 15 candidates contesting the election, the words 'None of the Above' shall be written on the 16th panel and the ballot button against such 16th panel shall also be kept open.

# **The Election Commission of India – Powers and Functions**

#### **Constitutional Body**

India is a socialist, secular, democratic republic and the largest democracy in the world. The modern Indian nation State came into existence on 15th August 1947. Since then free and fair elections have been held at regular intervals as per the principles enshrined in the Constitution, Electoral Laws and System.

The Constitution of India has vested in the Election Commission of India the superintendence, direction and control of the entire process for conduct of elections to Parliament and Legislature of every State and to the offices of President and Vice President of India.

Election Commission of India is a permanent Constitutional body. The Election Commission was established in accordance with the Constitution on 25th January 1950. The commission celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2001.

Originally the commission had only a Chief Election Commissioner. It currently consists of Chief Election Commissioners and two Election Commissioners.

For the first time two additional Commissioners were appointed on 16th October, 1989 but they had a very short tenure till 1st January, 1990. Later, on 1st October, 1993 two additional Election Commissioners were appointed. The concept of multi-member Commission has been in operation since then, with decision-making power by majority vote.

#### **Appointment and Tenure of Commissioners**

The President appoints Chief Election Commissioner and election Commissioners. They have tenure of six years, or up to the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier. They enjoy the same status and receive salary and perks as available to Judges of the Supreme Court of India. The Chief Election Commissioner can be removed from office only through impeachment by Parliament.

#### **Transaction of Business**

The Commission transacts its business by holding regular meetings and also by circulation of papers. All Election Commissioners have equal say in the decision making of the Commission. The commission, from time to time, delegates some of its executive functions to its officers in its Secretariat

#### **Setup**

The Commission has a separate Secretariat at New Delhi, consisting about 300 officials, in a hierarchical setup.

Two or three Deputy Election Commissioners who are the senior most officers in the Secretariat assist the Commission. They are generally appointed from the National Civil Service of the country and are selected and appointed by the Commission with tenure. Directors, Principal Secretaries, and Secretaries, Under Secretaries and Deputy Directors support the Deputy Election Commissioners in turn. There is a functional and territorial distribution of work in the Commission.

The work is organised in Divisions, Branches and sections; each of the last mentioned units is in charge of a Section Officer. The main functional divisions are Planning, Judicial, Administration, information Systems, Media and Secretariat Coordination. The territorial work is distributed among separate units responsible for different zones into which the 35 constituent States and Union Territories of the country are grouped for convenient management.

At the State level, the election work is supervised, subject to overall superintendence, direction and control of the Commission, by the Chief Electoral Officer of the State, who is appointed by the Commission from amongst senior civil servants proposed by the concerned State Government. He is, in most of the States, a full-time officer and has a small team of supporting staff.

At the district and constituency levels, the district Election Officers, Electoral Registration Officers and Returning Officers, who are assisted by a large number of junior functionaries, perform election work. They all perform their functions relating to elections in addition to their other responsibilities. During election time, however, they are available to the Commission, more or less, on a fulltime basis.

The gigantic task force for conducting a countrywide general election consists of nearly five million polling personnel and civil police forces. This huge election machinery is deemed to be on deputation to the Election Commission and is subject to its control, superintendence and discipline during the election period, extending over a period of one and half to two months.

#### **Budget and Expenditure**

The Secretariat of the Commission has an independent budget, which is finalised directly in consultation between the commission and the Finance Ministry of the Union Government. The latter generally accepts the recommendation of the Commission for its budgets. The major expenditure on actual conduct of elections is, however, reflected in the budgets of the concerned constituent units of the Union, States and Union Territories. If elections are being held only for the Parliament, the expenditure is borne entirely by the Union Government while for the elections being held only for the State Legislature, the expenditure is borne entirely by the concerned State. In case of simultaneous elections to the Parliament and State Legislature, the expenditure is shared equally between the Union and the State Governments. For capital equipment, expenditure related to preparation for electoral rolls and the scheme for Electors Identity Cards too, the expenditure is shared equally.

# **Executive Interference Barred**

In the performance of its functions, Election Commission is insulated from executive interference. It is the commission which decides the election schedules for the conduct of elections, whether general elections or byelections. Again, it is the commission which decides on the location of polling stations, assignment of voters to the polling stations, location of counting centres, arrangements to be made in and around polling stations and counting centres and all allied matters.

### **Political Parties and the Commission**

Political parties are registered with the Election Commission under the law. The Commission ensures inner party democracy in their functioning by insisting upon them to hold better organisational elections at periodic intervals. Political parties so registered with it are granted recognition at the State and National levels by the Election Commission on the basis of their poll performance at general elections according to criteria prescribed by it. The Commission, as a part of its quasi-judicial jurisdiction, also settles disputes between the splinter groups of such recognised parties.

Election Commission ensures a level playing field for the political parties in election fray, through strict observance by them of a Model Code of Conduct evolved with the consensus of political parties.

The commission holds periodical consultations with the political parties on matters related to the conduct of elections, compliance of Model Code of Conduct and new measures proposed to be introduced by the Commission on election-related matters.

#### **Advisory Jurisdiction and Quasi-Judicial Functions**

Under the Constitution, the Commission also has advisory jurisdiction in the matter of post-election disqualification of sitting members of Parliament and State Legislatures. Further, the cases of persons found guilty of corrupt practices at elections which come before the Supreme Court and High Courts are also referred to the Commission for its opinion on the question as to whether such person shall be disqualified and, if so, for what period. The opinion of the Commission in all such matters is binding on the President or, as the case may be the Governor to whom such opinion is tendered.

The Commission has the power to disqualify a candidate who has failed to lodge an account of his election expenses within the time and in the manner prescribed by law. The Commission also has the power for removing or reducing the period of such disqualification under the law.

#### **Judicial Review**

The decisions of the Commission can be challenged in the High Court and the Supreme Court of the India by appropriate petitions. By long standing convention and several judicial pronouncements, once the actual process of elections has started, the judiciary does not intervene in the actual conduct of the polls. Once the polls are completed and result declared, the commission cannot review any result on its own. This can only be reviewed through the process of an election petition, which can be filed before the High Court, in respect of elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures. In respect of elections for the offices of the President and Vice President, such petitions can only be filed before the Supreme Court.

# **Media Policy**

The Commission has a comprehensive policy for the media. It holds regular briefings for the mass media – print and electronic – on a regular basis, at close intervals during the election period and on specific occasions as necessary on other occasions. The representatives of the media are also provided facilities to report on actual conduct of poll and counting.

They are allowed entry into polling stations and counting centres on the basis of international and national media. The Commission also publishes statistical reports and other documents which are available for research and study to members of the academic fraternity; media representatives and anybody else interested.

The Commission has, in cooperation with the State owned media – Doordarshan and All India radio – taken up a major campaign for awareness of voters. The Prasar Bharti Corporation which manages the national Radio and Television networks, has brought out several innovative and effective short clips for this purpose.

#### **International Cooperation**

India is a founding member of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) Stockholm, Sweden. In the recent past, the Commission has expanded international contacts by way of sharing of experience and expertise in the areas of Electoral Management and Administration, Electoral Laws and Reforms. Election Officials from the national electoral bodies and other delegates from the several countries – Russia, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Indonesia, South Africa, Bangladesh, Thailand, Nigeria, Namibia, Bhutan, Australia, the United States and Afghanistan etc. – have visited the Commission for a better understanding of the Indian Electoral Process. The Commission has also provided experts and observers for elections to other countries in cooperation with the United Nations and the Commonwealth Secretariat.

#### **New Initiatives**

The Commission has taken several new initiatives in the recent past. Notable among these are, a scheme for use of state-owned electronic media for broadcast/telecast by political parties, checking criminalisation of politics, computerisation of electoral rolls, providing electors with Identity cards, simplifying the procedure for maintenance of accounts and filling of the same by candidates and a variety of measures for a strict compliance of Model Code of Conduct, for providing a level playing field to contestants during the elections.

# **The Representation of People Act – An Introduction**

In modern times, unless otherwise indicated, the word democracy stands for representative democracy, a practice whereby the people choose their *representatives*, who conducts the government on behalf of their electorates, the people. If people choose their representatives and vest (if nor surrender) with them their power, then how to ensure that they would stay moral and represent the genuine interests of the people?

*'And the people always put forward a single champion of their interests, whom they nurse to greatness. Here, plainly enough, is the root from which despotism invariably springs'*, Plato warned us so in his *Republic* which he wrote around 380 BC. The reader by now might have got an assumption that the modern representative democracies must have devised some mechanism to ensure that such champions of peoples interest remain great, and if they fail in their greatness, they would be deprived of their power. Undoubtedly, the world's largest democracy has its own mechanism to make certain this idea.

It comes to us in the form of Constitutional provisions, the Representation of People's Act 1950 and the Representation of People's Act 1951. The two acts stand today along with several amendments and a wide array of healthy and active judicial interpretations. Together they serve as the guardian of our representative democracy and electoral politics. What are such provisions of Constitution and these two Acts dealing with the representatives and electorates? Whether these provisions had prevented the Plato-warned-not-so-great personalities from entering the Parliament or State Legislatures? Or even if they have entered whether they have been disqualified promptly? Had the electors played their part in keeping Indian democracy healthy? These questions, in the same order, would remain as the guiding force for both the author and the reader, the active citizens of the Indian democracy, in their respective attempts of exploring and understanding.

# **Background of the Representation of People's Acts**

The Constitution when came into force, contained certain articles which laid down the basic fundamental details regarding peoples representatives, elections and the election machinery. As they themselves would not be sufficient, the articles empowered the Parliament to enact laws to supplement them. As the reader knows, since independence on 15th August, 1947, the Constituent Assembly functioned as the Provisional Parliament. Part XXI of the Constitution contained the translational provisions. It empowered the Provisional Parliament to make legislations. The first general election to the Indian Parliament was to be held once the Constitution gets ready. This necessitated the Provisional Parliament to make an act to govern the election. Accordingly the Provisional Parliament enacted two acts in succession, *'The Representation of the People's Act1950'and'The Representation of the People'sAct 1951'*, before the first general election which was held from October 1951 to March 1952. Governance is a dynamic process which has to keep pace with the changing aspirations and needs of the society. Accordingly the Act was amended several times (the latest one being 2010) to incorporate and repeal certain provisions.

While the provisions of Parts II A, II B, III and IV of RP Act 1950 and Parts II, VI, VII and VIII of RP Act 1951 and the issues emerged out of them would be the subject matter of this unit, the remaining Parts would be discussed under the next unit, *'Constitutional Provisions and Representation of the People Act II– Election Machinery, Elections and Electoral Reforms'*.

# **Important Provisions of Representation of People's Acts 1950 and 1951**

The Representation of People's Acts have a number of significant provisions which deals with the election process. The Parliament framed these rules in order to effectively conduct the elections in the country. The following are some of the important provisions in the Act, and by studying this we would be able to analyse various problems and issues associated with it.

# **Qualifications of Elected Representatives of People in Parliament and Assembly (RP Act, 1951)**

The Representative of People Act talks about the qualification of persons who can contest the election. Apart from the Act, the Constitution also contains provisions regarding the qualification of person contesting the elections.

# **Disqualifications of an Elected Representative of People in Parliament and Assembly (RP Act 1951)**

The following are the provisions regarding disqualification of a member as provided in the Constitution and the Representative of People's Act. The Articles 102 and 191 in the Constitution of India talk about these provisions of disqualification. The Constitution now also lays down an additional disqualification on the ground of 'defection', but it is relevant only for sitting members of Parliament and state legislatures for continuing as such member. Part 102(2) and 191(2) read with the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution].

*Constitutional Provisions*: A person shall be disqualified for being chosen as, and for being, a member of either House of Parliament or State Legislature

- **a.** If he holds any office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State, other than those office declared by Parliament by law (a person shall not be deemed to hold an office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State by reason only that he is a Minister either for the Union or for such State).
- **b.** If he is of unsound mind and declared so by a competent court.
- **c.** If he is an undischarged insolvent.
- **d.** If he is not a citizen of India, or has voluntarily acquired the citizenship of a foreign State, or has acknowledged allegiance or adherence to a foreign state.
- **e.** If he is so disqualified by/under any law made by the Parliament.

**f.** A person shall be disqualified for being a member of either House of Parliament or the Legislative Assembly or Legislative Council of a State if he is so disqualified under the Tenth Schedule – Anti-defection law.

#### **Provisions for Disqualifications under the RP Act 1951:**

These disqualifications have been presently prescribed by the Parliament in chapter III of Part II of the 1951 Act, containing Sections 7 to 11 thereof. These disqualifications are:

- **a.** Disqualification on conviction for certain offences (S 8);
- **b.** Disqualification on ground of commission of corrupt practices (S 8A);
- **c.** Disqualification for dismissal from government service for corruption or disloyalty (S 9);
- **d.** Disqualification for contract with 'appropriate government' (S 9A);
- **e.** Disqualification for holding office under government company (S 10); and
- **f.** Disqualification for failure to lodge account of election expenses (S 10A).

**'Disqualification'** is defined in Section 7(b) to mean disqualification for being chosen as, and for being, a member of either House of Parliament or of the legislative assembly or legislative council of a state.

'Appropriate government' is defined in Section7(a) to mean in relation to any disqualification for membership of Parliament, the Central Government, and in relation to any disqualification for membership of a state legislature, the government of the state concerned.

#### **(a) Disqualification on Conviction for Certain Offences**

**Object of the provision:** Conviction for certain offences– electoral, economic or criminal–has been considered by the Parliament a sufficient ground for disqualification of the convicted person for membership of Parliament and of state legislatures (**Section 8, 1951 Act**). The Supreme Court has observed in K Prabhakaran v P Jayarajan, that the purpose of enacting disqualification under **Section 8**: '…. is to prevent criminalisation of politics. Those who break the law should not make the law'.

**Classification of offences:** Parliament has classified offences under Section 8 into three categories having regard to the nature and gravity of those offences.

The first category of offences is listed out in S8 (1), where the mere conviction itself, without reference to any quantum of punishment therefore, attracts disqualification. These offences are:

- **a.** Section 153 A (offence of promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) or Section 171 E (offence of bribery) or Section 171 F (offence of undue influence or personation at an election) or sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) of section 376 or Sec 376A or Sec 376B or Sec 376C or Sec 376D (offences relating to rape) or section 498A (offence of cruelty towards a woman by husband or relative of a husband) or sub-Section (2) or sub-Section (3) of Section 505 (offence of making statement creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes or offence relating to such statement in any place of worship or in any assembly engaged in the performance of religious worship or religious ceremonies) of the Indian Penal Code 1860;
- **b.** The protection of Civil Rights Act 1955, which provides for punishment for the preaching and practice of 'untouchability', and for the enforcement of any disability arising there from;
- **c.** Section 11 (offence of importing or exporting prohibited goods) of the Customs Act 1962;
- **d.** Sections 10 to 12 (offence of being a member of an association declared unlawful, offence relating to dealing with funds of an unlawful association or offence relating to contravention of an order made in respect of a notified place) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967;
- **e.** The Foreign Exchange (Regulation) Act 1973;
- **f.** The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1985;
- **g.** Section 3 (offence of committing terrorist acts) or Section4 (offence of committing disrupting activities) of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act 1987;
- **h.** Section 7 (offence of contravention of the provisions of Sections3 to 6) of the Religious Institutions (Prevention of Misuse) Act 1988;
- **i.** Section 125 (offence of promoting enmity between classes in connection with the election) or Section135 (offence of removal of ballot papers from polling stations) or Section135A (offence of booth capturing) or cl (a) of sub-Section(2) of Section136 (offence of fraudulently defacing or fraudulently destroying any nomination paper) of the Representation of the People Act 1951;
- **j.** Section 6 (offence of conversion of a place of worship) of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act 1991;

- **k.** Section 2 (offence of insulting the Indian National Flag or the Constitution of India) or Section3 (offence of preventing singing of National Anthem) of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act 1971;
- **l.** The Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act 1987;
- **m.** The Prevention of Corruption Act 1988;
- **n.** The Prevention of Terrorism Act 2002

The disqualification under this Section 8(1) is for a period of six years from the date of conviction where the convicted person is sentenced to fine only. Where, however, the convicted person is sentenced to imprisonment for any period, he shall be disqualified from the date of conviction and shall continue to be disqualified for a further period of six years since his release.

The second category of offences listed in **Section 8(2)** relate to **hoarding or adulteration of food or drugs or dowry**, where the conviction coupled with a sentence of imprisonment for not less than six months invites disqualification. The resultant disqualification runs during the period of sentence of imprisonment and for a further period of six years from the release.

The third category **in Section 8(3**) includes all other offences for which a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years. Here also, the disqualification is operative during the period of sentence of imprisonment and for a further period of six years from his release.

#### **(b) Section 8(4) of the RP Act 1951**

Other than the above-mentioned offences, **Section 8(4)** of the RP Act 1951 says that, if a person convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years in any other case shall be disqualified from the date of such conviction and shall continue to be disqualified for a further period of six years since his release. But in this case if the convicted person makes an appeal to a higher court against the verdict given in the lower court within a period of three months of the lower court's conviction then he can continue to be a member until the appeal is disposed in the higher court. (One has to note here that on 10th July, 2013, in the Lily Thomas v. Union of India Case, the Supreme Court has struck down this provision as unconstitutional and hence void. This would be discussed later under *'Judiciary and RP Act–A Savior for CleansingElectoralPolitics'* )

#### **(c) Disqualification for Dismissal from Government Service for Corruption or Disloyalty**

Dismissal for corruption or disloyalty – A government servant dismissed for corruption or for disloyalty to the state shall be disqualified for five years from the date of such dismissal [**Section 9(1), 1951 Act**]. The words 'corruption' and 'disloyalty to the state' have not been defined in the 1951 – Act, and these words will have to take their respective meanings from other relevant laws, like the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 and the Indian Penal Code 1860.

If during the period of five years since dismissal, any dismissed government servant wishes to contest an election, he has to produce a certificate from the Election Commission that he has not been dismissed for corruption or disloyalty to the state and such certificate by the Election commission shall be conclusive of the fact [**Section 9(2), 1951 Act**]. Such certificate has to be annexed to the nomination paper itself and in the absence of such certificate accompanying a nomination paper, the candidate shall not be deemed to be duly nominated and his nomination shall be liable to be rejected on this ground alone [s 33(3), 1951 Act].

**(d) Disqualification for Contracts with Government Disqualification for contracts, underlying object** – A contract by a person with the government may also disqualify him for membership of Parliament and of state legislatures [**Section 9A**, 1951 – Act]. The underlying intention here also is to ensure that there is no conflict between public duty and private interests.

**Contracts which disqualify** – But it is not every contract with the government which attracts disqualification. Only specified types of contracts entail disqualification. Under the present law, a person shall be disqualified by reason of a contract with the government if: (a) the contract has been entered into by him in the course of his trade or business; (b) the contract is for the supply of goods to, or for the execution of any works undertaken by, the government; (c) the contract is with the appropriate government; and (d) the contract is still subsisting.

#### **(e) Disqualification for Holding Office under Government Company**

**Only specified offices to attract disqualification** – While dealing with the question of disqualification on holding an office of profit, it has been mentioned that, according to the tests laid down by the Supreme Court for determining the question whether an office shall entail disqualification, the employees of government companies, corporations and undertakings shall normally not attract the disqualification for the purpose under the Constitution. However, it is provided by Parliament that if a person is holding the office of a: (i) managing agent; (ii) manager; or (iii) secretary of any company or corporation (other than a cooperative society) in the capital of which the appropriate government has not less than 25% shares, such person shall also be disqualified (s 10, 1951 Act). It, however, deserves to be noted that the disqualification shall be attracted only by the persons holding the above-mentioned offices and not by the other employees of such government companies or corporations. Further, all cooperative societies also fall outside the purview of this disqualificatory provision. No definition of managing agent, manager or secretary has been provided in the 1951 Act, and these offices may derive their meanings from the Companies Act 1956.

A clerk in the Coal India Ltd., a government company, was not held to be holding the office of Manager though he occasionally performed some supervisor function. A Khalasi or meter reader holding a non-executive post in Bokaro Steel Plant, a government company, was also held not to be disqualified within the meaning of **Section 10** of the 1951 Act or art 191 (1) (a) of the Constitution.

#### **(f) Disqualification for Failure to Lodge Account of Election Expenses**

**Disqualification for failure without good reason or justification** – Every candidate at an election to the House of the People or to a state legislative assembly has to keep and maintain a separate account of his election expenses incurred or authorised by him or by his election agent between the date on which he has been nominated as such candidate and the date of declaration of result of the election, both dates inclusive [**Section 77(1), 1951 Act**]. The law further requires that every contesting candidate shall lodge a true copy of the account of his election expenses with the district election officer of the district in which his constituency falls, within a period of 30 days from the date of declaration of result of the election (**Section 76**).

Rule 86 of the 1961 Rules prescribes that the account should be maintained from day to day and should show the particulars mentioned in that rule. In order to ensure that the candidates maintain their accounts in the manner required, the Election Commission has now devised a register in which such account is to be maintained by every candidate. It is supplied by the returning officer to each candidate as soon as he files his nomination paper. After the election, this very register is now required to be submitted by the candidate to the district election officer, along with some abstract statements showing the details of his expenditure under various heads and sub-heads. The account of expenditure may be maintained in English, Hindi or any local language in which the electoral roll is printed.

If a candidate fails to lodge the account of his election expenses within the time and in the manner required, he shall be disqualified by the Election Commission, if he has no good reason or justification for his failure (**Section 10A**). Such disqualification shall be operative for a period of three years from the date of order of the Election Commission so disqualifying him.

#### **(g) Disqualification on Ground of Commission of Corrupt Practices**

Apart from the above conditions, a candidate contesting in an election shall be disqualified on account of *'corrupt practices'* made by him during and in election. There are some corrupt practices which are provided in the IPC, but these are general in nature and relate to all elections held under any law to any elective body. The provisions under the Representative of People's Act, 1951, is applicable only to the elections held to the State legislature and the Parliament, it does not cover other elections including to that of the office of President and Vice President.

In cases of corrupt practices, whether it is committed by the candidate or any person authorised by the candidate, it has the effect of vitiating the whole election and the whole constituency suffers as it would have to face reelection. Hence, the person committing such acts suffers from criminal liability.

Any such corrupt practices can be dealt by means of an election petition, and only when the said election is over in accordance with the provisions under Article 329 of Constitution of India.

If the high court in the trial of an election petition, or the Supreme Court on appeal, finds a person guilty of commission of corrupt practice, it names him so by an order under **Section 99** of the 1951 Act. Such guilty person may invite disqualification for contesting elections in future to Parliament and state legislatures [**Section 8A (1**), **1951 Act**], for six years from the date the order of the court, finding him guilty takes effect [proviso to **Section 8A (1**)].

The person so found guilty of commission of corrupt practice under **Section 99** may not necessarily be a candidate at the election. He can even be a third person.

The question whether such a person should be disqualified and, if so, for what period, is determined by the President. Before giving his decision in the matter, the President is required to obtain the opinion of the Election Commission and he is bound to act according to such opinion [**Section 8A (3)**].

**Meaning of corrupt practice** – The term 'corrupt practice' here means only the corrupt practices as defined in **Section 123** of the 1951 Act, and not any other irregularity or malpractice at an election.

**According to Section123 of the Act**, the following are the '*corrupt practices*' done by a candidate.

- **a. Bribery** providing any gift, offer of promise or of any gratification with the object of influencing the voter to vote or to stop from voting; to a candidate to withdraw from contesting.
- **b. Undue influence** any direct or indirect interference or attempt to interfere with the free exercise of any electoral right, by threatening any candidate or any elector with physical injury and social ostracism, or ex-communication or expulsion from any caste or community.
- **c.** The appeal to vote or refrain from voting for any person on the ground of his religion, race, caste, community or language or the use of, or appeal to religious symbols or the use of, or appeal to, national symbols, such as the national flag or the national emblem.
- **d.** The promotion of, or attempt to promote, feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of the citizens of India on grounds of religion, race, caste, community or language.
- **e.** The propagation of the practice or the commission of sati or its glorification by a candidate.
- **f.** The publication by a candidate of any statement of fact which is false in relation to the personal character or conduct of any other candidate.
- **g.** The obtaining of any assistance (other than the giving of vote) for the furtherance of the prospects of that candidate's election, from any person in the Government service.
- **h.** Booth capturing by a candidate or his agent or other person (inserted in 1989).

But here in this *'corrupt practices'* matter, the procedure for disqualification is different from that of others specified under the Act. Let us see what is the procedure for it. First, regarding corrupt practices done by a candidate who contests in election, it has to be challenged in the High Court under whose jurisdiction the offence takes place. It cannot be challenged through an ordinary case but only through an electoral petition. **What does an electoral petition mean?** The Act defines it as a petition calling in question any election presented to the High Court by any candidate at such election or any elector within 45 days from the date of election of the returned candidate. The High Court may reject the petition if it does not comply with the provisions of the Act. Or as soon as after an election petition has been presented to the High Court, it shall be referred to the Judge/Judges who has/ have been assigned by the Chief Justice for the trial of election petitions. The Act says, *'The trial of an election petition shall, so far as is practicable consistently with the interests of justice in respect of the trial, be continued*  *from day to day until its conclusion, unless the High Court finds the adjournment of the trial beyond the following day to be necessary for reasons to be recorded. Every election petition shall be tried as expeditiously as possible and endeavour shall be made to conclude the trial within six months from the date on which the election petition is presented to the High Court for trial'*. The High court may declare the election of all or any of the returned candidates to be void and even has the power to declare in its order that the petitioner or any other candidate to have been duly elected. But one has to note here that the order of the High Court alone cannot disqualify the person. It can only declare that particular election to be void. The person can be disqualified to stand in further elections only by the President of India. But before taking any decision on that matter, the President has to act in accordance with the advice given by the Election Commission. So in the analysis, one could see that in the ultimate, the Election Commission wields power with respect to disqualifying a representative on the grounds of 'corrupt practices'.

# **Registration of Political Parties**

**Part IV A, Section 29A** of The Representation of the People Act, 1951 empowers the Election Commission of India to register associations and bodies as political parties. All such associations or political parties in their Memorandum of the Rules should contain a specific provision that the association or body shall bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established, and to the principles of socialism, secularism and democracy, and would uphold the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India and the decision taken by the Commission shall be final.

There are many benefits of registering a party. First, the Representation of People's Act allows political parties to accept contributions voluntarily offered to it by any person or company other than a government company. Apart from this, candidates of registered parties get preference in allotment of election symbols. Other candidates are identified as independents and do not get preference in symbol allocation.

Registered political parties, in course of time, can get recognition as 'State Party' or 'National Party' subject to the **fulfilment of the conditions prescribed by the Commission in the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968**, as amended from time to time.

If a party is recognised as a 'State Party', it is entitled for exclusive allotment of its reserved symbol to the candidates set up by it in the state in which it is so recognised, and if a party is recognised as a 'National Party' it is entitled for exclusive allotment of its reserved symbol to the candidates set up by it throughout India. Recognised 'State' and 'National' parties need only one proposer for filing the nomination and are also entitled for two sets of electoral rolls free of cost at the time of revision of rolls and their candidates get one copy of electoral roll free of cost during General Elections. Further they get broadcast/ telecast facilities over Akashvani/Doordarshan during general elections. Political parties are entitled to nominate 'Star Campaigners' during General Elections. A recognised National or State party can have a maximum of 40 'Star campaigners' and a registered un-recognised party can nominate a maximum of 20 'Star Campaigners'. The travel expenses of star campaigners are not to be accounted for in the election expense accounts of candidates of their party.

The registered Political party has to keep the commission duly informed of any change in its name, head office, office bearers, address or any other matters.

A political party shall be treated as a recognised political party in a State, if and only if the political party fulfils any of the following conditions:

- At General Elections or Legislative Assembly elections, the party has won 3% of seats in the legislative assembly of the State (subject to a minimum of 3 seats).
- At a Lok Sabha General Elections, the party has won 1 Lok Sabha seat for every 25 Lok Sabha seats allotted for the State.
- At a General Election to Lok Sabha or Legislative Assembly, the party has polled minimum of 6% of votes in a State and in addition it has won 1 Lok Sabha or 2 Legislative Assembly seats.
- At a General Election to Lok Sabha or Legislative Assembly, the party has polled 8% of votes in a State.
- Similarly, a political party shall be treated as a recognised national party, if and only if the political party fulfils any of the following conditions:
- The party wins 2% of seats in the Lok Sabha (11 seats) from at least three different states.
- At a General Election to Lok Sabha or Legislative Assembly, the party polls 6% of votes in four states and in addition it wins 4 Lok Sabha seats.
- A party gets recognition as a State Party in four or more states.

Both national and state parties have to fulfil these conditions for all subsequent Lok Sabha or State elections. Else, they lose their status.

#### **Election Petitions**

Part VI of RPA, 1951 deals with the disputes regarding the elections and provides for the manner of presentation of election petitions, their trial and procedure. **Section 80 of RPA**, 1951 provides that, '**No election shall be called in question except by an election petition presented in accordance with the provisions of this part**'. The power is given to High Court to try these matters. Thus, the High Court of the particular state has the original jurisdiction to deal with such matters related to the election.

An election petition is a procedure for inquiring into the validity of the election results of Parliamentary or local government elections. In other words, it is a means under law to challenge the election of a candidate in a Parliamentary, Assembly or local election. It can be filed by any candidate, or an elector relating to the election personally, to the authorised officer of the High Court. It shall be filed within the time period of 45 days from the date of declaration of results.

The grounds for filing the election petition are given under Section 100 of the RPA. The election of a particular candidate can be declared void under section 100 of the Representation of People Act, 1951, if the High Court is of the opinion that

- **a.** On the date of his election a returned candidate was not qualified or was disqualified to be chosen to fill the seat.
- **b.** Any corrupt practice has been committed by a returned candidate or his election agent or by any other person with the consent of a returned candidate or his election agent.
- **c.** The nomination has been improperly accepted.
- **d.** Any improper reception, refusal or rejection of any vote or the reception of any vote which is void is done.
- **e.** The candidate has not complied with the provisions of the Constitution or RPA or any rules or orders made under this act.

When many election petitions are presented to the High Court in respect of the same election, all of them shall be referred for trial to the same judge who may, in his discretion, try them separately or in one or more groups. The Representation of Peoples Act recommends that every election petition shall be tried as expeditiously as possible and as far as practicable for the interests of justice. Every endeavour, its suggests, should be made on the part of the High Court to conclude a trial for an election petition within six months from the date on which the election petition was presented to the High Court for trial. And when the election of a candidate is declared void, any of his acts or proceedings in which that candidate has participated as a Member of Parliament or State Legislature, shall not be invalidated by reason of that order, nor shall such candidate be subjected to any liability or penalty on the ground of such participation.

#### **Delimitation of Constituencies**

The concept of delimitation involves not only demarcation or redrawing of boundaries of the territorial constituencies, but also adjustments in the allocation of seats to various states in the Lok Sabha and in the legislative assembly of the State.

The basic objective of the delimitation is to secure an equal representation for equal segments of the population in legislative bodies.

#### **Principles of Delimitation laid down by The Constitution of India**

- Constitution mandates that Delimitation of constituencies as determined by the authority, which was entrusted with the task, should be final and there should not be any intervention by any authority. This has been provided in the **Article 329 (a)** of the Indian Constitution.
- The constitution provided that, upon the completion of each census, the representation of several territorial constituencies in the house of people and legislative assembly of each state shall be, as parliament may by law determined **(Article 81 (3) and 174)** but Constitution was silent on who should undertake the initial territorial divisions. This gap has been filled by Representation of People Act, 1950.
- As per the constitutional mandate, delimitation has been done after every census.
- After the 1951 census, delimitation became due in all the states, Election Commission recommended to the government that the future delimitation of constituencies should be made by an independent commission and the decisions of such commission should be made final in law.

The government accepted their suggestion of the Election Commission and accordingly provided for the constitution of an independent Delimitation commission under the Delimitation Commission Act, 1952.

It has been done successively after the decennial censuses of 1961 and 1971. The **forty second Amendment Act, 1976** freezed the number of seats allocated to various states in the house of people, the total number of seats in the various state legislative assemblies and the extent of all parliamentary and assembly constituencies until the next census taken after the year 2000.

The **Constitution (Eighty Fourth Amendment) Act 2001**, provided that the number of seats allocated to various states in the house of people and the total number of seats in the state legislative assemblies, as determined on the basis of 1971 census, would remain further frozen till the year 2026. But that eighty fourth constitutional amendment further provided that all parliamentary and assembly constituencies in the country would be delimited afresh on the basis of 1991 census. Subsequently delimitation without increasing the number of seats has been done.

#### **Authority to Delimit Council Constituencies**

The power to delimit council constituencies is vested with the President. The President makes the order delimiting council constituencies on the basis of recommendation of Election Commission.

The procedure laid down in **section 13 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950**, was followed in delimiting the constituencies in 1951. In actual experience it was found that the procedure did not work very smoothly or satisfactorily. In particular, sub-section (3) of that section made the Delimitation Orders issued by the President subject to amendments by the Parliament and many of them were in fact materially amended by the Parliament.

The Election Commission recommended to the Government accordingly that future delimitation of constituencies should be made by an independent body, more or less judicial in composition and that the scheme of delimitation worked out by it should be made final in law. This recommendation was accepted and the Delimitation Commission Act, 1952 (Act 81 of 1952) was enacted by the Parliament. Under this Act, a Commission is required to be constituted for readjusting the representation of the territorial constituencies of the House of the People and the Legislative Assembly of each State, other than Jammu and Kashmir, and delimiting these constituencies. The Commission is to consist of three members, two of the members being serving or retired Judges of the Supreme Court or High Courts, while the third member is to be the Chief Election Commissioner ex-officio. The Commission that was eventually set up had a retired Judge of the Supreme Court as its Chairman and a retired Chief Justice of a High Court as the second member. The law provides that in the performance of its duties, the Commission is to be assisted by two to seven associate members for each State drawn from the members of the House of the People representing the State and of the Legislative Assembly of the State. The associate members were appointed by the Speaker of the House of which they were members. In making these appointments due regard was paid by the Speaker to the composition of the House. The associate members were not given the right to vote or to sign any decision of the Commission. In the case of the three Part 'C' States — Kutch, Manipur and Tripura which had no Legislative Assemblies, the two members of the House of the People representing each of the States were appointed as the associate members for the State.

All decisions were taken by the Delimitation Commission after consultation with the associate members. In ease of any difference of opinion amongst the members of the Commission, the opinion of the majority prevailed.

The Delimitation Commission Act laid down the procedure to be followed by the Commission in readjusting the representation and in delimiting the constituencies. The Commission was first to determine on the basis of the latest census figures the number of seats to be allotted to each of the states in the House of the People and to its Legislative Assembly. The Commission was also required in respect of each state to determine on the basis of the figures of population the number of seats, if any, to be reserved for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes of the State in the House of the People and in its Legislative Assembly. The Commission was then to distribute the seats so reserved amongst the constituencies to be delimited for the House of the People and the Legislative Assembly.

The following were the principles, to be followed in the delimitation of constituencies:

- **a.** Every constituency shall be either a single-member or a two-member constituency.
- **b.** The Commission was given the discretion, to continue either or both of the existing three-member constituencies. (These were a-House of the People constituency in West Bengal and a Legislative Assembly constituency in Bombay). In any such threemember constituency, one seat was to be reserved for the Scheduled Castes and another for the Scheduled Tribes.
- **c.** Wherever practicable, seats were to be reserved for the Scheduled Castes or for the Scheduled Tribes in single-member constituencies.
- **d.** In every two-member constituency, one seat was to be reserved either for the Scheduled Castes or for the Scheduled Tribes, while the other seat would not be so reserved.
- **e.** Constituencies in which a seat is reserved either for the Scheduled Castes or for the Scheduled Tribes were, as far as practicable, to be located in areas in which the population of the Scheduled Castes or, as the case may be, of the Scheduled Tribes is most concentrated. In regard to the Scheduled Castes, however,

care was to be taken to distribute the seats reserved for them in different areas of the State.

**f.** All constituencies should, as far as practicable, consist of geographically compact areas, and in delimiting them, regard was to be had to physical features, the existing boundaries of administrative units, facilities of communication and public convenience.

# **Electoral Roll – Issues Concerning Qualifications and Disqualifications of an Elector**

For a free and fair election, an accurate and error-free electoral roll is the most important pre-requisite. Some of the electoral malpractices like bogus voting and impersonations can be attributed, to a large extent to the defective electoral rolls. For enhanced participation of electors in the electoral process and reducing the electoral malpractices, it is essential to improve the registration processes which will in turn increase the credibility of the electoral rolls. Therefore, adequate stress has to be given to the preparation and revision of the electoral rolls.

#### **Constitutional provisions in regard to electoral roles***:*

- **1.** Under **Article 324(1)** of the Constitution of India, the superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of the electoral rolls for all elections to Parliament and to the Legislature of every state is vested in the Election Commission.
- **2. Article 325** of Constitution of India provides that there shall be one general electoral roll for every territorial constituency and no person shall be ineligible for inclusion in any such roll or claim to be included on grounds only of religion, race, caste or sex.
- **3.** Under **Article 326** of Constitution of India, every person who is a citizen of India and who is not less than 18 years of age and is not disqualified under the Constitution or any law made by the appropriate legislature on the ground of non-residence, unsoundness of mind, crime or corrupt or illegal practice, shall be entitled to be registered as a voter at any election to the House of the People or to a State Legislative Assembly.
- **4.** The Parliament has been authorised by **Article 327**  of the Constitution to make provisions by law with respect to all matters relating to elections to either House of Parliament or to the House or either House of the Legislature of a State including preparation of electoral rolls. In exercise of such power, the Parliament has enacted the Representation of the People Act 1950.

#### **Provisions of Representation of People's Act 1950 with regard to electoral roles**

The RP Act 1950 has conferred on the Central Government, the power to make rules, after consulting the Election Commission for carrying out the purposes of the aforesaid Act. In exercise of this power the Central Government has promulgated the Registration of Electors Rules (RER), 1960. The Election Commission has issued various directions under the RPA, 1950 and the RER, 1960 from time to time. In addition, the Commission has also issued a number of instructions and clarifications. All the above constitute the framework of law under which the preparation and revision of electoral roll has to be carried out.

The Delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly Constituencies Order, as amended from time to time, defines the territorial extent of each Assembly Constituency and the Parliamentary Constituency. A number of Assembly Constituencies comprise a Parliamentary Constituency. All Assembly and Parliamentary Constituencies are territorial, that is, have fixed geographical boundaries. An exception is the Sangha Assembly Constituency in Sikkim which comprise of monks residing in recognised monasteries all over the State of Sikkim.

The electoral rolls are maintained Assembly Constituency (AC) wise. The electoral roll of a Parliamentary Constituency consists of the electoral rolls for all the assembly constituencies comprised within that parliamentary constituency. J&K and Union Territories (UTs) not having a Legislative Assembly are the exceptions. In them the electoral rolls are prepared separately for Parliamentary Constituencies and separately for Assembly Constituencies.

In order to maintain the credibility of roll and to keep it updated, the aforesaid Acts and Rules provide for periodic revision of rolls. It is prepared based on house to house visit by the Enumerator. The electoral rolls are prepared or revised with reference to

- First day of January of the year in which the rolls are so prepared or revised.
- Before each general election to the House of the People or to the Legislative Assembly of a State.
- Before each byelection to fill a casual vacancy in a seat allotted to the constituency.
- Further, the Election Commission may at any time, direct a special revision of the electoral roll for any constituency or part of a constituency.

#### **Publication of the Roll**

Putting the roll on the website, immediately as it is published, is a very important step in the revision process. The website shall further facilitate an elector to check whether he/she has been registered as an elector or not and what are the details registered against his/her entry in the roll.

#### **Disqualifications for Registration in an Electoral Roll**

- **a.** According to the RP Act 1950, a person shall be disqualified for registration in an electoral roll if he/ she
  - **(i)** Is not a citizen of India; or
  - **(ii)** Is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court; or

in Indian Missions/High Commissions are enrolled in their native places and not at their places of postings. They are called 'Service Voters'.

- **f.** Overseas electors: The RP Act 1950 was amended in 2010 and was provided that every overseas elector, that is, an Indian citizen who is absenting from his place of ordinary residence in India owing to employment, education or otherwise, and has not acquired citizenship of any other country and who is not included in the electoral roll, is entitled to have his/her name registered in the electoral roll of the constituency in which his/her place of residence in India as mentioned in his/her passport is located.

- **29. How it is ensured that Control Unit of EVM has not been tampered with? (Recent allegations made by AAP)**

Ans. Before votes recorded in the EVM are counted, the carrying case and control unit of EVM are placed on the counting table for the inspection and checking of seals thereon by the candidate or their agents present at the counting table. If control unit is found to have been tampered with, votes recorded in that machine are not counted and matter is reported to the Commission for further direction.

**30. Can a candidate ask for a recount?**

Ans. Yes. By a written application stating the grounds on which recount is asked for. Such application can be made to the Returning Officer, who prepares and signs Final Result Sheet (Form 20).

**31. Is a candidate free to spend as much as he likes on his election?**

Ans. No. A candidate is not free to spend as much as he likes on his election. The law prescribes that the total election expenditure shall not exceed the prescribed maximum limit for the constituency concerned. (As per: Rule 90 of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 and Section 123 (6) of Representation of People Act, 1951.)

Every contesting candidate has to lodge a true copy of the said account within 30 days of result of the election. (As per: Sections 77 & 78 of the Representation of People Act, 1951). The account of election expenses shall be lodged by a contesting candidate with the District Election Officer of the district in which the constituency from which he contested lies. (As per : Section 78 of the Representation of People Act, 1951)

(As per: Section 10A of the Representation of People Act, 1951)

**34. Whether the expenditure incurred for preparation of campaigning materials prior to the date of nomination be accounted for in the election expenditure**.

Ans: Yes. The candidates, while maintaining their register of accounts of election expenditure, should also account for all expenditure including those incurred prior to the date of nomination for preparation of campaign materials etc. which are actually used during the post nomination period/in connection with the election.

# **35. Whether the expenditure incurred by a political party on advertisements be accounted for in the account of the candidates**.

Ans. Yes. The expenditure incurred by a political party on advertisements, in connection with any election could be categorised into the following: (i) Expenditure on general party propaganda seeking support for the party and its candidates in general, but, without any reference to any particular candidate or any particular class/group of candidates (ii) Expenditure incurred by the party, in advertisements etc. directly seeking support and/or vote for any particular candidate or group of candidates. (iii) Expenditure incurred by the party which can be related to the expenditure for promoting the prospects of any particular candidate or group of candidates. In the case of any advertisement by political parties, whether in print or electronic or any other media, falling in category (i) above, which is not relatable to the election of any particular candidate or a given group of candidates, the expenditure may be treated as expenditure of the political party on general party propaganda. In the cases of expenditure falling in categories (ii) and (iii) above, that is, cases where the expenditure is relatable to the election of a particular candidate or a group of candidates, the expenditure shall be treated as expenditure authorised by the candidates concerned and such expenditure shall be accounted for in the election expenses accounts of the candidates concerned. In those cases where the expenditure is incurred by the party for the benefit of a given group of candidates, the expenditure is to be apportioned equally among the candidates.

**36. What is an Electronic Voting Machine? In what way its functioning is different from the conventional system of voting?**

Ans. An Electronic Voting Machine consists of two Units – a Control Unit and a Balloting Unit – joined by a three-meter cable. The Control Unit remains with the Presiding Officer or a Polling Officer and the Ballot Unit is placed inside the voting compartment. Instead of issuing a ballot paper, the Polling Officer in charge of the Control Unit will press the Ballot Button. This will enable the voter to cast his vote by pressing the blue button on the Balloting Unit against the candidate and symbol of his choice.

# **37. What are the unique features of EVMs?**

Ans. It is a simple machine that can be operated easily by both the polling personnel and the voters. It is sturdy enough to withstand rough handling and variable climatic conditions. Being a standalone machine without any network connectivity, nobody can interfere with its programming and manipulate the result.

#### **38. What are the features of Control Unit?**

Ans. The Control Unit is the main unit which stores all data and controls the functioning of EVM. The program which controls the functioning of the control unit is burnt into a microchip on a 'one time programmable basis'. Once burnt, it cannot be read, copied out or altered. The EVMs use dynamic coding to enhance security of data transmitted from ballot unit to control unit. The new EVMs have also got real-time clock and date-time stamping facility which enables them to record the exact time and date whenever key is pressed. After the voting is completed and the close button is pressed, the machine does not accept any data or record any vote. Through the press of 'total' button, the control unit can display the number of votes recorded till that time which can be cross checked with the register of voters in Form 17-A. The display system of the control unit shows the total number of votes polled in a polling station and the candidate-wise votes polled in the machine when the 'result' button is pressed by the counting staff in the presence of counting agents at the counting center. The control unit can also detect any physical tampering made with the connecting cable and indicate the same in the display unit.

#### **39. What are the features of Balloting Unit?**

Ans. It holds the ballot paper containing the names and symbols of candidates. When pressed, the candidate button on the ballot unit sends a signal to the control unit where this is recorded in a non-volatile memory which can store the poll data indefinitely even without a battery backup.

#### **40. Can booth capturing be prevented by the use of EVMs?**

Ans. By booth-capturing, if one means, taking away or damaging of ballot boxes or ballot papers, this evil cannot be prevented by the use of EVMs as EVMs can also be forcibly taken away or damaged by miscreants. But if one looks at booth capturing as a case of miscreants intimidating the polling personnel and stamping the ballot papers on the symbol and escaping in a matter of minutes, this can be prevented by the use of EVMs. The EVMs are programmed in such a way that the machines will record only five votes in a minute. As recording of votes has necessarily to be through Control Unit and Balloting Unit, whatever be the number of miscreants they can record vote only at the rate of 5 per minute. In the case of ballot papers, the miscreants can distribute all the 1000 odd ballot papers assigned to a polling station, among themselves, stamp them, stuff them into the ballot boxes within a few minutes and run away before the police reinforcements reach. In EVMs, in half-an–hour, the miscreants can record only a maximum of 150 votes by which time, chances are the police reinforcement would have arrived. Further, the presiding Officer or one of the Polling Officers can always press the 'close' button as soon as they see some intruders inside the polling station. It will not be possible to record any vote once the 'close' button is pressed and this will frustrate the efforts of the booth capturers.

#### **41. What are the advantages in using EVMs?**

Ans. The first and most important advantage is that the printing of millions of ballot paper scan be dispensed with, as only one ballot paper is required for fixing on the Balloting Unit at each polling station instead of one ballot paper for each individual elector. This results in huge savings by way of cost of paper, printing, transportation, storage and distribution. Second, counting is very quick and the result can be declared within 2 to 3 hours as compared to 30–40 hours, on an average, under the conventional system. Third, there are no invalid votes under the system of voting under EVMs. The importance of this will be better appreciated, if it was remembered that in the past in several cases, the number of invalid votes is more than the winning margin between the winning candidate and the second candidate, in a number of constituencies. To this extent, the choice of the electorate will be more correctly reflected when EVMs are used.

# **Conclusion**

*Democracy must, in essence, mean the art and science of mobilising the entire physical, economic and spiritual resources of all the various sections of the people, in the service of the common good of all.*

 *— Mahatma gandhi*

In a democratic country, the word 'election' symbolises the active and direct participation of the people of a nation to form a Government. It is universally accepted that for a democracy to work as one, its citizens elect their representatives and, in turn, rule themselves. The elections represent the general will of the people, as expressed in their votes. The voting population expresses its choice of candidate, political party and Government through exercising their franchise at regular intervals. The votes of the electors crystallise into the mandate of the people. Elections are held in our country every five years (the only exception is the six-year term of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly).

By exercising their franchise, voters express their changing expectations and convictions regarding the kind of government they want.

The voters are the main stakeholders in a democracy and they vote with the belief that the Government, as the main arbiter of the future of the country and its people, will provide every citizen the best possible policies to build a better country, a better community, and a better life.

They also believe that it will work in the most efficient way to further their economic and social welfare, alleviate poverty and reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, build infrastructure, and formulate and implement policies that will ultimately improve the quality of life of every citizen, reduce the existing differences between different sections of society to make the social order as egalitarian as possible, maintain law and order, and protect the legal rights and civil liberties of the citizens.

The legitimacy of the entire democratic system of governance depends on the efficacy and effective working of the electoral mechanism. If the verdict of the people, which forms the basis of the propriety and legitimacy of the political system, is vitiated by unethical methods, the faith of the people in the electoral system gets eroded and ultimately destroys the very foundations of democracy.

In elections, voting is a primary manifestation of democratic behaviour. It creates and preserves the authenticity and credibility of democracy.

An electorate of informed and politically and socially aware citizens, determined to exercise their right to vote wisely, are equipped to build the right environment for a free and fair elections.

Democracy and elections are inextricable. In the Indian context, the emphasis has always been on creating a social order in which the people, by casting their vote without any coercion or inducement, make decisions about their government.

Electoral integrity is concerned with open dialogue, debate and information-sharing among leaders and the public. This depends on public confidence in electoral and political processes. Inclusiveness, transparency and accountability are tenets fundamental to developing the confidence of the voters in the electoral process. The four main tenets of a fair election process are:

- **1.** Universal suffrage
- **2.** Periodicity of election (i.e., prefixed term of the Lok Sabha/Legislative Assembly)
- **3.** Independent election management bodies (EMBs)
- **4.** Free, fair and transparent electoral process

Thus, the Representation of People Acts help to achieve a fair, periodic, independent and transparent election process which is the hallmark of democracy.
