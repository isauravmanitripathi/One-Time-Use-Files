literacy on culture and communication.

Pew of us can remember when we first became aware that words signified something.<br>Yet that moment was a milestone, not only in our acquisition of language but in our process of learning the configuration of attitudes, beliefs, and elaborate behaviors that constitutes our culture. Without language, the transmission of complex traditions would be virtually impossible, and each of us would be left trapped within a world of private sensations.

Helen Keller, whom illness made deaf and blind at the age of 19 months, gives a moving account of the afternoon she first established contact with another human being through words:

[My teacher] brought me my hat, and I knew I was going out into the warm sunshine. This thought, if a wordless sensation may be called a thought, made me hop and skip with pleasure.

We walked down the path to the well house, attracted by the fragrance of the honeysuckle with which it was covered. Someone was drawing water and my teacher placed my hand under the spout. As the cool stream gushed over one hand she spelled into the other the word water, first slowly, then rapidly. Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of something forgotten—a thrill of returning thought; and somehow the mystery of language was revealed to me. I knew then that w-a-t-e-r meant the wonderful cool something that was flowing over my hand. That living word awakened my soul, gave it light, hope, joy, set it free! There were barriers still, it is true, barriers that could in time be swept away.

I left the well house eager to learn. Everything had a name, and each name gave birth to a new thought. As we returned to the house every object which I touched seemed to quiver with life. That was because I saw everything with the strange, new sight that had come to me.<sup>1</sup>

# Communication

Against all odds, Helen Keller had come to understand the essential function that language plays in all societies—namely, to communicate. The word *communicate* comes from the Latin verb communicare, "to impart," "to share," "to make common." We communicate verbally by agreeing, consciously or unconsciously, to call an object, a movement, or an abstract concept by a common name. Speakers of English, for example, have agreed to call the color of grass *green*, even though we have no way of comparing precisely how two people actually experience this color. What we share is the agreement to call similar visual sensations *green*. Any system of language consists of publicly accepted symbols by which individuals try to share private experiences and thoughts. Communication is much broader than language. It can involve any means of transmission of information as long as the symbols, signs, or behaviors are shared and commonly understood.

Much research has been devoted to whether the capacity for language makes the human species unique. In the process, scholars have examined human—and nonhuman communication—in all its varieties. While spoken language is considered the major transmitter of human culture, we have also come to understand that we also communicate a great deal nonverbally. And even when we speak, we also tell what we mean through nonverbal signals.<sup>2</sup>

#### Nonverbal Human Communication

We all know from experience that the spoken word does not communicate everything we perceive about a social situation. As social theorist Anthony Wilden has put it, "every act, every pause, every movement in living and social systems is also a message; silence is communication; short of death it is impossible for an organism or person not to communicate."<sup>3</sup> We can usually tell, for instance, whether people mean it when they say, "Nice to meet you." We often can tell by their demeanor when others are sad, even if they merely say, "I'm fine" in response to the question, "How are you?" We communicate directly not only through spoken language but also indirectly through what we informally call "body language." We also communicate indirectly with nonverbal symbolic systems, such as writing, algebraic equations, chemical formulas, musical scores, code flags, and road signs. And artistically, we communicate with art, music, and dance.

14.1 Define communication, and compare and contrast human and nonhuman communication.

**Kinesics** is the study of direct communication by nonverbal or nonvocal means, including posture, mannerisms, body movement, facial expressions, and other signs and gestures. Some direct nonverbal communication appears to be universal. Humans the world over, for example, seem to understand common facial expressions in the same way; that is, they are able to recognize a happy, sad, surprised, angry, disgusted, or afraid face.4 How the face is represented in art also appears to evoke similar feelings in many different cultures. For example, masks intended to be frightening often have sharp, angular features and inward- and downward-facing eyes and eyebrows.5

Will everyone the world over interpret a smile or a frown in the same way? Some scholars argue that anger, for example, may be understood differently across cultures, or that the emotion term each culture associates with a facial expression may have different connotations. Paul Ekman, who carried out the experiment with Japanese and American participants, believes that some basic emotions are universal and that his research shows the facial expressions of emotion to be human universals. But he is careful to point out that "universal" does not mean that every person in every culture will interpret an expression the same way. Rather, he uses "universal" in the sense adopted by most anthropologists: to identify a pattern of human behavior that *seems* to hold true in a significantly diverse and random sampling of cultures.6

On the other hand, the kinds of facial expressions and other nonverbal gestures that are considered appropriate in a given situation can vary from culture to culture. For example, in a study comparing how the Japanese and Americans express emotions, individuals from both groups were videotaped while they were shown films intended to evoke feelings of fear and disgust. Both groups exhibited expressions of fear and disgust when they watched the films alone. However, when an authority figure was present, the Japanese subjects more often than the Americans tried to mask their negative feelings with a half-smile.7

Certainly many body and hand gestures are far from universal. Specific signs and gestures are often culturally variable and the cause of cultural misunderstandings. For example, moving the head up and down signals "yes" in the United States, but "no" in Greece. For governments and their diplomats, learning the fine points of another culture's body language has historically been an essential tool of cross-cultural cooperation. Now that business is conducted on a worldwide scale, kinesics has become an essential part of a business person's training as well.8

Nonverbal communication is not always voluntary or conscious. Our words may express one thought while our eyes or body language or tone of voice betray what we truly feel. Moreover, we may rely on unconscious signals when we form opinions of others. In many Western cultures, for example, a limp handshake, especially paired with a shifting gaze, can make us feel uncertain about a new acquaintance. At the very least, we may feel that the person has no interest in interacting with us. Researchers in Alabama performed an experiment with 112 female and male college students to see if such reactions were valid. The students were told that they would be taking a personality test. They did not know that their handshaking style would also be assessed by trained "handshake" technicians. The results showed a strong correspondence between particular personality traits and handshaking styles. For example, female participants who tested as "more extroverted and open to experience and less neurotic and shy" also tended to have firmer handshakes.9 Another study tested a more primal kind of communication: the ability to decode *pheromones*, the molecular compounds that we all secrete through our sweat glands. When female college students were asked to sniff a series of swatches marked with sweat, many were able to identify the samples that came from donors who were experiencing fear or stress.10 (Perhaps because females are typically taught to be more sensitive to others, they tend to be more skilled at assessing nonverbal behavior.)11

Nonverbal symbolic communication systems are yet another way humans interact without speaking. Although no system is used universally, many cultures develop systems that are collectively understood. Among the most interesting of these for anthropologists are so-called gesture calls. These include whistled languages, which, through a system of whistling sounds made by variation in amplitude and frequency, mimic the sounds and syntax of the society's spoken language. Whistled languages appear in low-density societies where communication across considerable distance is needed or where noise in the natural environment may impede hearing normal speech. Some internationally accepted symbolic languages, such as mathematical and musical notation, enable us to communicate across cultural and language boundaries.

Apes lack the human capacity for speech, so researchers have explored the capacity of chimpanzees and other apes to communicate with hand gestures. Researcher Joyce Butler teaches Nim, a chimpanzee, a sign for "drink."

**Paralanguage** Refers to all the optional vocal features or silences apart from the language itself that communicate meaning.

**Accents** Differences in pronunciation characteristic of a group.

**Paralanguage** is the study of all the nonverbal vocal sounds, including the silent pauses in speech, with which humans interact.12 We can tell a lot by the tone and pitch of a voice. A depressed person might speak very quietly and use a flat tone of voice. If a person thought about explaining what was really wrong but thought better of it, a significant pause or silence might come before the words, "I'm fine." **Accents** (differences in pronunciation) can reveal a person's place of origin, education, and, in some cultures, social class. And people communicate a wealth of meaning through their grunts, laughs, giggles, moans, and sighs.

How can silence be a communication? Silence may reflect companionship, as when two people work side by side on a project, or it may be a way to establish personal boundaries, as when strangers share an elevator. Because our silences in social interaction are open to interpretation, they can also be misunderstood. In North America, for example, the pauses in a conversation when one person finishes speaking and another person begins can vary by region. People raised in New York City may signal that they are fully engaged in a conversation by jumping in and responding while the other person is still speaking. In the South and Southwest, where such overlapping speech can be perceived as an interruption—that is, rude—there is typically a slight pause in conversation when one speaker finishes and the other speaker begins.

#### Nonhuman Communication

Systems of communication are not unique to human beings. Other animal species communicate in a variety of ways. One way is by sound. A bird may communicate by a call that "this is my territory"; a squirrel may utter a cry that leads other squirrels to flee from danger. Another means of animal communication is odor. An ant releases a chemical when it dies, and its fellows then carry it away to the compost heap. Apparently, the communication is highly effective; a healthy ant painted with the death chemical will be dragged to the funeral heap again and again. Bees use another means of communication, body movement, to convey the location of food sources. Karl von Frisch discovered that the black Austrian honeybee—by choosing a round dance, a wagging dance, or a short, straight run—can communicate not only the precise direction of the source of food but also its distance from the hive.13

One of the greatest scholarly debates is about the degree to which nonhuman animals, particularly nonhuman primates, differ from humans in their capacity for language. Some scholars see so much discontinuity that they propose that humans must have acquired (presumably through mutation) a specific genetic capability for language. Others see much more continuity between humans and nonhuman primates and point to research that shows much more cognitive

capacity in nonhuman primates than previously thought possible. They point out that the discontinuity theorists are constantly raising the standards for the capacities thought necessary for language.14 For example, in the past, only human communication was thought to be symbolic. But recent research suggests that some monkey and ape calls in the wild are also symbolic.

When we say that a call, word, or sentence is **symbolic communication**, we mean at least two things. First, the communication has meaning even when its *referent* (whatever is referred to) is not present. Second, the meaning is arbitrary; the receiver of the message could not guess its meaning just from the sound(s) and does not know the meaning instinctively. In other words, symbols have to be learned. There is no compelling or "natural" reason that the word *dog* in English should refer to a smallish, four-legged omnivore.

Vervet monkeys are not as closely related to humans as are African apes. Nevertheless, scientists who have observed vervet monkeys in their natural environment consider at least three of their alarm calls to be symbolic because each of them *means* (refers to) a different kind of predator—eagles, pythons, or leopards—and monkeys react differently to each call. For example, they look up when they hear the "eagle" call. Experimentally, in the absence of the referent, investigators have been able to evoke the normal reaction to a call by playing it back electronically. Another indication that the vervet's alarm calls are symbolic is that infant vervets appear to need some time to learn the referent for each call. Very young vervets will often make the eagle warning call, for example, when they see any flying bird. They apparently learn the appropriate referent through reinforcement: Adult vervets repeat their "correct" calls. This process is probably not too different from the way a North American infant in an English-speaking family first applies the "word" *dada* to all adult males and gradually learns to restrict it to one person,15 or from the way the Embers' daughter Kathy named all pictures of four-footed animals, including elephants, "dog" when she was 18 months old.

All of the nonhuman vocalizations we have described so far enable individual animals to convey messages. The sender gives a signal that is received and "decoded" by the receiver, who usually responds with a specific action or reply. How is human vocalization different? Because monkeys and apes appear to use symbols at least some of the time, it is not appropriate to emphasize symbolism as the distinctive feature of human language. However, there is a significant quantitative difference between human language and other primates' systems of vocal communication. All human languages employ a much larger set of symbols.

Another often-cited difference between human and nonhuman vocalizations is that the other primates' vocal systems are *closed*—that is, different calls are not combined to produce new, meaningful utterances. In contrast, human languages are *open* systems,

governed by complex rules about how sounds and sequences of sounds can be combined to produce an infinite variety of meanings.16 For example, an English speaker can combine *care* and *full* (*careful*) to mean one thing, then use each of the two elements in other combinations to mean different things. *Care* can be used to make *carefree, careless,* or *caretaker; full* can be used to make *powerful* or *wonderful.* And because language is a system of shared symbols, it can be reformed into an infinite variety of expressions and be understood by all who share these symbols. In this way, for example, T. S. Eliot could form a sentence never before formed—"In the room the women come and go/talking of Michelangelo"17—and all speakers of English could understand the sense of his sentence, if not necessarily what he meant.

Although no primatologist disputes the complexity and infinite variety with which human languages can combine sounds, other primates (cotton-top tamarins, pygmy marmosets, capuchin monkeys, and rhesus macaques) also combine calls in orderly sequences<sup>18</sup> but not nearly as much as humans do.

Another trait thought to be unique to humans is the ability to communicate about past or future events. But Sue Savage-Rumbaugh has observed wild bonobos leaving what appear to be messages to other bonobos to follow a trail. They break off vegetation where trails fork and point the broken plants in the direction to follow.

Perhaps most persuasive are the successful attempts to teach apes to communicate with humans and with each other using human-created signs. These successes have led many scholars to question the traditional assumption that the gap between human and other animal communication is enormous. Even a parrot, which has a small brain, has been taught to communicate with a human trainer in ways once thought impossible. Alex (the parrot) could correctly answer questions in English about what objects were made of, how many objects of a particular type there were, and even what made two objects the same or different.19 When he is not willing to continue a training session, Alex says, "I'm sorry . . . Wanna go back."20

Chimpanzees Washoe and Nim and the gorilla Koko were taught hand signs based on American Sign Language (ASL), which is used by the hearing impaired in the United States. The chimpanzee Sarah was trained with plastic symbols. Subsequently, many chimpanzees were trained on symbol keyboards connected to computers. Some of the best examples of linguistic ability come from a chimpanzee named Kanzi. In contrast to other apes, Kanzi initially learned symbols just by watching his mother being taught, and he spontaneously began using the computer symbols to communicate with humans, even indicating his intended actions. Kanzi did not need rewards or to have his hands put in the right position, and he understood a great deal of what was said to him in English. For example, when he was 5 years old, Kanzi heard someone talk about throwing a ball in the river, and he turned around and did so. Kanzi has come close to having a primitive English grammar when he strings symbols together.21 If chimpanzees and other primates have the capacity to use nonspoken language and even to understand spoken language, then the difference between humans and nonhumans may not be as great as people used to think.

Are these apes really using language in some minimal way? Many investigators do agree about one thing—nonhuman primates have the ability to "symbol," to refer to something (or a class of things) with an arbitrary "label" (gesture or sequence of sounds).22 For example, Washoe originally learned the sign *dirty* to refer to feces and other soil and then began to use it insultingly, as in "dirty Roger," when her trainer Roger Fouts refused to give her things she wanted.

When we discuss the structure of sounds (phonology) later in this chapter, we will see that every human language has certain ways of combining sounds and ways of not combining those sounds. Apes do not have anything comparable to linguistic rules for allowed and disallowed combinations of sounds. In addition, humans have many kinds of discourse. We make lists and speeches, tell stories, argue, and recite poetry. Apes do none of these things.23 But apes do have at least some of the capacities for language. Therefore, understanding their capacities may help us better understand the evolution of human language.

# The Origins of Language

How long humans have had spoken language is not known. There is widespread agreement that human language must have existed at least by about 50,000 years ago because there are archaeological signs of extensive symbolism in both art and ritual in the Upper Paleolithic. But others believe language probably arose earlier. For example, it is now known that Neandertals and modern humans share the same gene called FOXP2. This gene is directly associated with language ability in recent populations. Because Neandertals and modern humans share the same gene, some believe that Neandertals must have had language too.24 However, genes can have multiple purposes, and the presence of a gene is not unambiguous evidence of language. Because the only unambiguous remains of language are found on written tablets, and the earliest stone tablets date back only about 5,000 years,25 pinpointing the emergence of earliest languages remains speculative.

Many scholars believe that understanding the emergence of language will be aided by more research on systems of communication in other animals. Certainly this research has led to an understanding that there is much more capacity than previously realized. But there is also an understanding that animal communications systems lack the open-ended power of human language, so it is widely believed that genetic changes must have occurred in human evolution to make language possible after the human line separated from apes.26 But we do know that the actual development of individual language is not completely biologically determined; if it were, all human beings would speak the same brain-generated language. Instead, over 6,000 mutually unintelligible languages have been identified. More than 2,000 of them were still spoken as of recently, most by peoples who did not traditionally have a system of writing. Can we learn anything about the origins of language by studying the languages of nonliterate (without writing) and technologically simpler societies? The answer is no, because such languages are not simpler or less developed than ours. The sound systems, vocabularies, and grammars of technologically simpler peoples are in no way inferior to those of peoples with more complex technology.27 Of course, people in other societies, and even some people in our own society, will not be able to name the sophisticated machines used in our society. All languages, however, have the potential for doing so. As we will see later in this chapter, all languages possess the amount of vocabulary their speakers need, and all languages expand in response to cultural changes. A language that lacks terminology for some of our conveniences may have a rich vocabulary for events or natural phenomena that are of particular importance to the people in that society.

If there are no primitive languages, and if the earliest languages have left no traces that would allow us to reconstruct them, does that mean we cannot investigate the origins of language? Some linguists think that understanding the way children acquire language, which we discuss shortly, can help us understand the origins of language. Other linguists have suggested that an understanding of how creole languages develop will also tell us something about the origins of language.

#### Pidgin and Creole Languages

In many contact situations where one group is much more powerful than the other, people shift to the dominant language, and their native language gradually becomes lost. However, some contact situations led to a different result—the development of a new language, different from the dominant language or the previous native languages.

Some languages developed where European colonial powers established commercial enterprises that relied on imported labor, generally slaves. The laborers in one place often came from many different societies and, in the beginning, would speak with their masters and with each other in some kind of simplified way, using linguistic features of one or more of the languages. Often, most of the vocabulary is drawn from the masters' language.28 These *pidgin languages* become a new way of communicating. Pidgins are simplified languages and lack many of the building blocks found in the languages of whole societies, building blocks such as prepositions (*to, on,* and so forth) and auxiliary verbs (designating future and other tenses). If a pidgin language is used merely as system of communicating in a limited setting, it may not develop into a fully developed language. However, children may begin to use pidgin as their first language. The pidgin

#### **Can Languages Be Kept from Extinction?**

any peoples and their languages are endangered. In the last few hundred years, and continuing in some places today, Western expansion and colonization have led to the depopulation and extinction of many native societies, mainly as a result of introduced disease and campaigns of extermination. Thus, many languages disappeared with the peoples who spoke them. More than 50 of approximately 200 aboriginal languages in Australia disappeared relatively quickly as a result of massacre and disease.

Today, native languages are endangered more by the fact that they are not being passed on to children. Political and economic dominance by speakers of Western languages undoubtedly play an enormous role in this process. First, schooling is usually conducted in the dominant language. Second, when another culture is dominant, the children may prefer to speak in the language perceived to have higher prestige.

Almost all the languages of aboriginal Australia are now gone. This is a worldwide trend. It is estimated that 50 to 90 percent of the 6,000 to 7,000 of the world's languages will be gone by 2100. What can be done? For a long time, linguists have worked on describing languages that are endangered, often working closely with the few remaining speakers. Although description is essential to language preservation, linguists are increasingly engaging actively in efforts to revitalize endangered languages by participating in community programs and by playing active roles in organizations that are preserving, often in digitized archives, endangered languages and recordings of speech. After all, without speakers or any written records, languages are truly lost. The following are a few examples of "dead" languages being brought back to life. Kaurna, a language of Australia abandoned for over a century, is now used in songs, ritual events, public

speeches, and everyday greetings. It has moved from no use to some use. Hebrew is an often-cited example of a "dead" language that was brought back to life because more than 5 million people now speak it. However, Hebrew, like Latin, was never really "dead" in the same sense as Kaurna. Hebrew has been used in religious contexts for over 16 centuries and had extensive written literature. But the Hebrew case indicates that for successful revitalization to occur, a community of people must be strongly motivated to revive it.

Total immersion programs are probably the most likely to work, but they are the most costly and difficult to implement. School programs employing total immersion during the school day beginning with preschool have had considerable success among the Maori of New Zealand, as well as among Hawaiians of the United States and the Mohawk of Canada. Bilingual programs are perhaps the most popular programs, but they use only partial immersion. UNESCO favors a very different approach: to first teach adults, who can then teach their children naturally.

H. Russell Bernard believes that "to keep a language truly alive we must produce authors." With the help

of computer technology, which allows reconfiguring a keyboard to produce special characters for sounds, Bernard has taught native speakers to write their native languages directly on computers. These texts then become the basis for dictionaries. Although these authors may not be using the standardized characters that linguists use, they are producing "written" materials that might otherwise be lost forever. These texts also convey ideas about curing illness, acquiring food, raising children, and settling disputes. On a broader scale, the Web provides a way for far-flung people to access language materials, pick up advice for teaching languages, and even feel more part of a "community" with those whose language is shared.

We are not sure when humans first developed spoken language. But the enormous linguistic diversity on this planet took a long time to develop. Unfortunately, it may take only a short time for that diversity to become a thing of the past.

language may expand and become more complex grammatically.29 Many pidgin languages developed into and were replaced by so-called *creole languages,* which incorporate much of the vocabulary of another language (often the masters' language) but also have a grammar that differs from it and from the grammars of the laborers' native languages.30

Derek Bickerton argues that there are striking grammatical similarities in creole languages throughout the world.31 This similarity, he thinks, is consistent with the idea that some grammar is inherited by all humans. Creole languages, therefore, may resemble early human languages. All creoles use intonation instead of a change in word order to ask a question. The creole equivalent of the question "Can you fix this?" would be "You can fix this?" The creole version puts a rising inflection at the end; in contrast, the English version reverses the subject and verb without much inflection at the end. All creoles express the future and the past in the same grammatical way, by the use of particles (such as the English *shall*) between subject and verb, and they all employ double negatives, as in the Guyana English Creole "Nobody no like me."<sup>32</sup>

It is possible that many other things about language are universal, that all languages are similar in many respects, because of the way humans are "wired" or because people in all societies have similar experiences. For example, names for frogs may usually contain *r* sounds because frogs make them.33

#### Children's Acquisition of Language

A child is apparently equipped from birth with the capacity to reproduce all the sounds used by the world's languages and to learn any system of grammar. Research on 6-month-old infants finds that they can distinguish the sounds of approximately 600 consonants and 200 vowels—all the sounds in all the known languages of the world. However, this capability gives way to cultural influences around the time babies turn 1, when they become more adept at recognizing the salient, or prominent, sounds and sound clusters of their parents or caretakers and less adept at distinguishing those of other languages.34

Children's acquisition of the structure and meaning of language has been called the most difficult intellectual achievement in life. If that is so, it is pleasing to note that they accomplish it with relative ease and vast enjoyment. All over the world, children begin to learn language at about the same age. By 12 or 13 months of age, children are able to name a few objects and actions, and by 18 to 20 months, they can make one key word stand for a whole sentence: "Out!" for "Take me out for a walk right now"; "Juice!" for "I want some juice now." Evidence suggests that children acquire the concept of a word as a whole and that they especially learn sequences of sounds that are stressed or at the ends of words (e.g., "raffe" for giraffe). These universal ways of acquiring language hold true even for children with hearing

impairments who are learning a sign language.35 Children the world over tend to progress to two-word sentences at about 18 to 24 months of age. They express themselves in "telegraph" form sentences, using noun-like words and verblike words but leaving out the seemingly less important words. A two-word sentence, such as "Shoes off," may stand for "Take my shoes off"; "More milk" may stand for "Give me more milk, please."36 They do not utter their two words in random order, sometimes saying "off" first, other times saying "shoes" first. If children say, "Shoes off," then they will also say, "Clothes off" and "Hat off." They seem to select an order that fits the conventions of adult language, so they are likely to say, "Daddy eat," not "Eat Daddy." In other words, they tend to put the subject first, as adults do. And they tend to say "Mommy coat" rather than "Coat Mommy" to indicate "Mommy's coat."37 Adults do not utter sentences such as "Daddy eat," so children seem to know a lot

A lot of language instruction occurs by pointing to something and saying what it is called.

# **Migrants and Immigrants**

#### Why are "Mother Tongues" Retained, and for How Long?

he longer an immigrant group lives in another country, the more they incorporate the culture of their new home. At some point, they no longer even partially understand their original language. Consider the people of Wales, the region west of England in Great Britain. Until about a century ago, they were mostly Welsh speakers. (The Welsh language, along with Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Breton, belongs to the Celtic subfamily of Indo-European, whereas English belongs to the Germanic subfamily.) When, in 1729, settlers from Wales established the Welsh Society in Philadelphia, the oldest ethnic organization in the United States, many of its members, if not all, spoke Welsh as well as English. But by the 20th century, hardly any of the descendants did.

Although immigrant groups eventually lose their "mother tongues" in many if not most countries, the process does not occur at the same rate in every group. Why is that? Why do some immigrant groups lose their language faster than others? Is it because they do not live in tightly knit ethnic enclaves, or because they marry outside their ethnic group? Or is it because they do not have traditional festivals or celebrations to mark their separate identity? A comparative study by Robert Schrauf revealed some likely reasons.

Schrauf used data on 11 North American ethnic groups drawn from the HRAF Collection of Ethnography. He noted that because these ethnoqraphies were written for more general purposes or for purposes other than linguistic study, they contained a wealth of sociocultural information, allowing him to test several factors for their possible effects on language retention and loss. Based on the data, Schrauf identified three levels of native language retention over time in North America by assessing the degree to which the language was spoken by the third generation (the grandchildren of immigrants):

1. Continued use, which he found among Chicanos, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Haitians.

![](_page_9_Picture_7.jpeg)

- 2. Some native language understanding, which he found among Chinese and Koreans.
- 3. No native language comprehension of the native language except for isolated words, with even the second generation (the children of immigrants) mostly speaking and understood only English, which he found among Italians, Armenians, and Basques.

Schrauf then measured seven social factors that might explain longer versus shorter retention of the mother tonque:

- 1. Lived in tightly knit communities
- 2. Maintained religious rituals
- 3. Had separate schools
- 4. Held traditional festivals
- 5. Visited the homeland
- 6. Did not intermarry with other aroups
- 7. Worked with others of the ethnic group

We might suspect that all of the factors Schrauf measured would lead people to retain their native language (and presumably other native cultural patterns). But not all do, apparently. Only living in tightly knit communities and retaining

religious rituals strongly predict retention of the mother tongue in the home into the third generation. Why? Possibly because life in an ethnic community and religious rituals are experienced early in life, and early socialization might have more lasting effects than such later experiences as schooling, visits to the homeland, marriage, and work. Participation in celebrations and festivals is probably important too, but it does not have quite as strong an effect, perhaps because celebrations and festivals are not everyday experiences.

As always with such studies, the findings raise questions for future research. Would the same effects be found outside of North America? Would the results be the same if we also looked at other immigrant groups in North America? Does frequent travel back to the homeland help language retention? Do some immigrant groups live in close-knit communities because of discrimination or by choice and, if so, is discrimination or choice a factor in language retention? Are some groups more interested in assimilating than others? And, if so, why?

about how to put words together with little or no direct teaching from their caretakers. Consider the 5-year-old who, confronted with the unfamiliar "Gloria in Excelsis," sings quite happily, "Gloria eats eggshells." To make the words fit the structure of English grammar is more important than to make the words fit the meaning of the Christmas pageant.

If there is a basic grammar imprinted in the human mind, we would expect that children's early and later speech patterns would be similar in different languages. We might also expect children's later speech to be similar to the structure of creole languages. And it is, according to Derek Bickerton.38 He says that the "errors" children make in speaking are consistent with the grammar of creoles. For example, English-speaking children 3 to 4 years old tend to ask questions by intonation alone, and they tend to use double negatives, such as "I don't see no dog," even though the adults around them do not speak that way and consider the children's speech "wrong."

But some linguists argue that the evidence for an innate grammar is weak because children the world over do not develop the same grammatical features at similar ages. For example, word order is a more important determinant of meaning in English than in Turkish; the endings of words are more important in Turkish. The word at the beginning of the sentence in English is likely to be the subject. The word with a certain ending in Turkish is the likely subject. Consistent with this difference, English-speaking children learn word order earlier than Turkish children do.39

Future research on children's acquisition of language and on the structure of creole languages may bring us closer to an understanding of the origins of human language. But even if much of grammar is universal, we still need to understand how and why the thousands of languages in the world vary, which brings us to the conceptual tools linguists have had to invent to study languages.

# Descriptive Linguistics

In every society, children do not need to be taught grammar to learn how to speak. They begin to grasp the essential structure of their language at a very early age, without direct instruction. If you show English-speaking children a picture of one "gork" and then a picture of two of these creatures, they will say there are two "gorks." Somehow they know that adding an *s* to a noun means more than one. But they do not know this consciously, and adults may not either. One of the most surprising features of human language is that meaningful sounds and sound sequences are combined according to rules that the speakers often do not consciously know.

These rules should not be equated with the "rules of grammar" you were taught in school so that you would speak "correctly." Rather, when linguists talk about rules, they are referring to the patterns of speaking that are discoverable in actual speech. Needless to say, there is some overlap between the actual rules of speaking and the rules taught in school. But there are rules that children never hear about in school because their teachers are not linguists and are not aware of them. When linguists use the term *grammar,* they are *not* referring to the prescriptive rules that people are supposed to follow in speaking. Rather, *grammar* to the linguist consists of the actual, often unconscious principles that predict how most people talk. As we have noted, young children may speak two-word sentences that conform to a linguistic rule, but their speech is hardly considered "correct."

Discovering the mostly unconscious rules operating in a language is a very difficult task. Linguists have had to invent special concepts and methods of transcription (writing) to permit them to describe these rules that have resulted in three related areas of study:

- 1. The study of aspects of language that predicts how sounds are made and how they are used is called **phonology**.
- 2. The study of how sound sequences (and sometimes even individual sounds) convey meaning and how meaningful sound sequences are strung together to form words is called **morphology**.
- 3. The study of how words are strung together to form phrases and sentences is called **syntax**.

Understanding the language of another people is an essential part of understanding the culture of that people. Although sometimes what people say is contradicted by their observed behavior, there is little doubt that it is hard to understand the beliefs, attitudes,

values, and worldview of a people without understanding their language and the nuances of how that language is used. Even behavior, which theoretically one can observe without understanding language, usually cannot be readily understood without interpretation. Imagine that you see people go by a certain rock and seemingly walk out of their way to avoid it. Suppose they believe that an evil spirit resides there. How could you possibly know that without being able to ask and to understand their answer?

#### Phonology

**Phones** A speech sound in a language.

Most of us have had the experience of trying to learn another language and finding that some sounds are exceedingly difficult to make. Although the human vocal tract theoretically can make a very large number of different sounds—**phones**, to linguists—each language uses only some of them. It is not that we cannot make the sounds that are strange to us; we just have not acquired the habit of making those sounds. And until the sounds become habitual for us, they continue to be difficult to make.

Finding it difficult to make certain sounds is only one of the reasons we have trouble learning a "foreign" language. Another problem is that we may not be used to combining certain sounds or making a certain sound in a particular position in a word. Thus, English speakers find it difficult to combine *z* and *d,* as Russian speakers often do, whereas Russian speakers may struggle with the *th* at the beginning of many common English words. The position of a sound may also be challenging. English speakers may have trouble pronounc-

#### Figure 14.1

ing the *ng* sound at the beginning of some words in Samoan, a South Pacific language, even though the sound is common at the end of English words, such *sing* and *hitting.*

To study the patterning of sounds, linguists who are interested in *phonology* have to write down speech utterances as sequences of sound. This task would be almost impossible if linguists were restricted to using their own alphabet (say, the one they use to write English) because other languages use sounds that are difficult to represent with the English alphabet or because the English alphabet represents a particular sound in different ways. (English writing represents the sound *f* by *f* as in *food,* but also as *gh* in *tough* and *ph* in *phone.*) In addition, in English, different sounds may be represented by the same letter. English has 26 letters and 46 significant sounds (sounds that can change the meaning of a word).40 To overcome these difficulties in writing sounds with the letters of existing writing systems, linguists have developed systems of transcription with special alphabets in which each symbol represents only one particular sound. Figure 14.1 shows the International Phonetic Alphabet symbols used to represent the phones in English.

Once linguists have identified the sounds or phones used in a language, they try to identify which sounds affect meaning and which sounds do not—that is, they try to determine which sounds just seem like variations in pronunciation to the language speakers and which sounds make an important difference. One way is to start with a simple word like *lake* and change the first sound to *r* to make the word *rake.* A linguist will ask

if this new combination of sounds means the same thing. Because an English speaker would say *lake* means something completely different from *rake,* we can say that in the English language the sound *l* at the beginning of a word conveys different meaning from the sound *r* at the beginning of a word. These minimal contrasts enable linguists to identify a **phoneme** in a language—a sound or set of sounds that makes a difference in meaning in that language.41 So the sound *l* in *lake* is different phonemically from the sound *r* in *rake.* The ways in which sounds are grouped together into phonemes vary from language to language. Each of us is so used to phonemes in our own language that it may be hard to believe that the contrast between *r* and *l* may not make a difference in meaning in some languages. For example, in Samoan, *l* and *r* can be used interchangeably in a word without changing the meaning. Therefore, these two sounds belong to the same phoneme in Samoan. (A Samoan speaker may call an American named Reuben either "Leupena" or "Reupena.")

English speakers may joke about languages that "confuse" *l* and *r,* but they are not usually aware that they do the same thing with other sets of sounds. For example, in English, the beginning of the word spelled *and* may be pronounced like the *a* in *air* or the *a* in *bat* without a change in meaning. If you say *air* and *bat* and focus on how you are forming the vowel sounds, you will realize that your mouth and tongue assume a different position to form the two sounds. Now think about *l* and *r.* Although the two letters of the alphabet are pronounced with very different tongue positions, when you utter them in words (with vowels) you will notice that they are only slightly different with respect to how far the tongue is from the ridge behind the upper front teeth. Languages do tend to consider sounds that are close as belonging to the same phoneme, but why they choose some sounds and not others to group together is not yet fully understood.

Some recent research suggests that infants may learn early to ignore meaningless variations of sound (those that are part of the same phoneme) in the language they hear at home. It turns out that, as early as 6 months of age, infants "ignore" sound shifts within the same phoneme of their own language, but they "hear" a sound shift within the phoneme of another language. Researchers are not sure how babies learn to make the distinction, but they seem to acquire much of the phonology of their language very early indeed.42

After discovering which sounds are grouped into phonemes, linguists can begin to discover the sound sequences that are allowed in a language and the usually unconscious rules that predict those sequences. For example, English has a number of *consonant blends,* but they rarely start with three nonvowel sounds. When they do, the first sound or phone is always an *s,* as in *strike* and *scratch.*43 (Some other words in English may start with three consonants but only two sounds are involved, as in *chrome,* where the *ch* stands for the sound in *k.*)

Linguists' descriptions of the sound patterns (phonology) in different languages may allow them to investigate why languages vary. Why, for example, are two or more consonant sounds strung together in some languages, whereas in other languages vowels are *almost* always put between consonants? The Samoan language now has a word for "Christmas" borrowed from English, but to fit Samoan rules the borrowed word has been changed to *Kerisimasi* (pronounced as if it were spelled Keh-ree-see-mah-see).

What explains why some languages alternate consonants and vowels more or less regularly? Recent cross-cultural research suggests three predictors of this variation. One predictor is a warmer climate. Where people live in warmer climates, the typical syllable is more likely to be a consonant-vowel syllable. Linguists have found that consonant-vowel syllables provide the most contrast in speech. Perhaps when people converse outdoors at a distance, which they are likely to do in a warmer climate, they need more contrast between sounds to be understood. A second predictor of consonant-vowel alternation is literacy. Languages that are written have fewer consonant-vowel syllables. If communication is often in written form, meaning does not have to depend so much on the contrast between adjacent sounds. A third (and indeed strongest) predictor of consonant-vowel alternation is the degree to which babies are held by others. Societies in which babies are held have a greater number of consonant-vowel syllables. Theoretically, babies that are held much of the day come to associate regular rhythm—the caretaker's heartbeat or rhythmic movements—with pleasurable experiences. That experience may generalize to a preference for regular rhythms in adult life, apparently including a regular consonant-vowel alternation in adult speech, as in *Kerisimasi.*<sup>44</sup>

**Phoneme** A sound or set of sounds that makes a difference in meaning to the speakers of the language.

#### Morphology

A phoneme in a language usually does not have a meaning by itself. Phonemes are combined with other phonemes to form a meaningful sequence of sounds. *Morphology* is the study of sequences of sounds that have meaning. Often these meaningful sequences of sounds make up what we call *words,* but a word may be composed of a number of smaller meaningful units. We take our words so much for granted that we do not realize how complicated it is to say what words are. People do not usually pause very much between words when they speak; if we did not know our language, a sentence would seem like a continuous stream of sounds. This is how we first hear a foreign language. Only when we understand the language and write down what we say do we separate the sounds (with spaces) into words. But a word is actually an arbitrary sequence of sounds that has a meaning; we would not "hear" words as separate units if we did not understand the spoken language.

Because anthropological linguists traditionally investigated unwritten languages, sometimes without the aid of interpreters, they had to figure out which sequences of sounds conveyed meaning. And because words in many languages can be broken down into smaller meaningful units, linguists had to invent special words to refer to those units. Linguists call the smallest unit of language that has a meaning a **morph**. Just as a phoneme may have one or more phones, one or more morphs with the same meaning may make up a **morpheme**. For example, the prefix *in-,* as in *indefinite,* and the prefix *un-,* as in *unclear,* are morphs that belong to the morpheme meaning *not.* Although some words are single morphs or morphemes (e.g., *for* and *giraffe* in English), many words are a combination of morphs, generally prefixes, roots, and suffixes. Thus *cow* is one word, but the word *cows* contains two meaningful units—a root (*cow*) and a suffix (pronounced like *z*) meaning more than one. The **lexicon** of a language, which a dictionary approximates, consists of words and morphs and their meanings.

It seems likely that the intuitive grasp children have of the structure of their language includes a recognition of morphology. Once they learn that the morph */-z/* added to a noun-type word indicates more than one, they plow ahead with *mans, childs;* once they grasp that the morpheme class pronounced */-t/* or */-d/* or */-ed/* added to the end of a verb indicates that the action took place in the past, they apply that concept generally and invent *runned, drinked,* and *costed.* They see a ball roll near*er* and near*er,* and they transfer that concept to a kite, which goes upp*er* and upp*er.* From their mistakes as well as their successes, we can see that children understand the regular uses of morphemes. By the age of 7, they have mastered many of the irregular forms as well—that is, they learn which morphs of a morpheme are used when.

The child's intuitive grasp of the dependence of some morphemes on others corresponds to the linguist's recognition of free morphemes and bound morphemes. A *free* morpheme has meaning standing alone—that is, it can be a separate word. A *bound* morpheme displays its meaning only when attached to another morpheme. The morph pronounced */-t/* of the bound morpheme meaning *past tense* is attached to the root *walk* to produce *walked;* but the */-t/* cannot stand alone or have meaning by itself.

In English, the meaning of an utterance (containing a subject, verb, object, and so forth) usually depends on the order of the words. "The dog bit the child" is different in meaning from "The child bit the dog." But in many other languages, the grammatical meaning of an utterance does not depend much, if at all, on the order of the words. Rather, meaning may be determined by how the morphs in a word are ordered. For example, in Luo, a language of East Africa, the same bound morpheme may mean the subject or object of an action. If the morpheme is the prefix to a verb, it means the subject; if it is the suffix to a verb, it means the object. Another way that grammatical meaning may be conveyed is by altering or adding a bound morpheme to a word to indicate what part of speech it is. For example, in Russian, when the subject of a sentence, the word for *mail* is pronounced something like *pawchtah*. When *mail* is used as the object of a verb, as in "I gave her the mail," the ending of the word changes to *pawchtoo.* And if I say, "What was in the mail?" the word becomes *pawchtyeh*.

Some languages have so many bound morphemes that they might express as a complex but single word what is considered a sentence in English. For example, the English sentence, "He will give it to you" can be expressed in Wishram, a Chinookan dialect that was spoken along the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest, as *acimluda* (a-c-i-m-l-ud-a,

**Morph** The smallest unit of a language that has a meaning.

**Morpheme** One or more morphs with the same meaning.

literally "will-he-him-thee-to-give-will"). Note that the pronoun *it* in English is genderneutral; Wishram requires that *it* be given a gender, in this case, "him."45

#### Syntax

Because language is an open system, we can make up meaningful utterances that we have never heard before. We are constantly creating new phrases and sentences. Just as they do for morphology, speakers of a language seem to have an intuitive grasp of *syntax*—the rules that predict how phrases and sentences are generally formed. These "rules" may be partly learned in school, but children know many of them even before they get to school. In adulthood, our understanding of morphology and syntax is so intuitive that we can even understand a nonsense sentence, such as this famous one from Lewis Carroll's *Through the Looking-Glass:*

*'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe*

Simply from the ordering of the words in the sentence, we can surmise which part of speech a word is, as well as its function in the sentence. *Brillig* is an adjective; *slithy,* an adjective; *toves,* a noun and the subject of the sentence; *gyre* and *gimble,* verbs; and *wabe,* a noun and the object of a prepositional phrase. Of course, an understanding of morphology helps too. The *-y* ending in *slithy* is an indication that the latter is an adjective, and the *-s* ending in *toves* tells us that we most probably have more than one of these creatures. In addition to producing and understanding an infinite variety of sentences, speakers of a language can tell when a sentence is not "correct" without consulting grammar books. For example, an English speaker can tell that "Child the dog the hit" is not an acceptable sentence but "The child hit the dog" is fine. There must, then, be a set of rules underlying how phrases and sentences are constructed in a language.46 Speakers of a language know these implicit rules of syntax but are not usually consciously aware of them. The linguist's description of the syntax of a language tries to make these rules explicit.

# Historical Linguistics

The field of **historical linguistics** focuses on how languages change over time. Written works provide the best data for establishing such changes. For example, the following brief passage from Chaucer's *Canterbury Tales,* written in the English of the 14th century, has recognizable elements but is different enough from modern English to require a translation.

*A Frere ther was, a wantowne and a merye, A lymytour, a ful solempne man. In alle the ordres foure is noon that kan So muche of daliaunce and fair language. He hadde maad ful many a mariage Of yonge wommen at his owene cost. A Friar there was, wanton and merry, A limiter [a friar limited to certain districts], a very important man. In all the orders four there is none that knows So much of dalliance [flirting] and fair [engaging] language. He had made [arranged] many a marriage Of young women at his own cost.47*

In this passage, we can recognize several changes. Many words are spelled differently today, and in some cases meaning has changed: *Full,* for example, would be translated today as *very.* What is less evident is that changes in pronunciation have occurred. For example, the *g* in *mariage* (marriage) was pronounced *zh,* as in the French from which it was borrowed, whereas now it is usually pronounced like either *g* in *George.*

Because languages spoken in the past leave no traces unless they were written, and most of the languages known to anthropology were not written by their speakers, you might think that historical linguists can study linguistic change only by studying written languages such as English. But that is not the case. Linguists can reconstruct changes that

have occurred by comparing contemporary languages that are similar. Such languages show phonological, morphological, and syntactical similarities because they usually derive from a common ancestral language. For example, Romanian, Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese have many similarities. On the basis of these similarities, linguists can reconstruct what the ancestral language was like and how it changed into what we call the Romance languages. Of course, these reconstructions can easily be tested and confirmed because we know from many surviving writings what the ancestral language, Latin, was like; we also know from documents how Latin diversified as the Roman Empire expanded. Thus, common ancestry is frequently the reason why neighboring, and sometimes even separated, languages show patterns of similarity.

But languages can be similar for other reasons too. Contact between speech communities, often with one group dominant over another, may lead one language to borrow from the other. For example, English borrowed a lot of vocabulary from French after England was conquered by the French-speaking Normans in a.d. 1066. Languages may also show similarities even though they do not derive from a common ancestral language and even though there has been no contact or borrowing between them. Such similarities may reflect common or universal features of human cultures or human brains or both. (As we noted earlier in the chapter, the grammatical similarities exhibited by creole languages may reflect how the human brain is "wired.") Finally, even unrelated and separated languages may show some similarities because of the phenomenon of convergence; similarities can develop because some processes of linguistic change may have only a few possible outcomes.

#### Language Families and Culture History

Latin is the ancestral language of the Romance languages. We know this from documentary (written) records. But if the ancestral language of a set of similar languages is not known from written records, linguists still can reconstruct many features of that language by comparing the derived languages. (Such a reconstructed language is called a **protolanguage**.) That is, by comparing presumably related languages, linguists can become aware of the features that many of them have in common, features that were probably found in the common ancestral language. The languages that derive from the same protolanguage are called a *language family.* Most languages spoken today can be grouped into fewer than 30 families. The language family that English belongs to is called *Indo-European* because it includes most of the languages of Europe and some of the languages of India. (Persian, spoken in Iran, and Kurdish also belong to this family.) About 50 percent of the world's population (now more than 6 billion people) speak Indo-European languages.48 (See Figure 14.2 for a simplified diagram of the Indo-European language family.) Another very large language family, now spoken by more than a billion people, is Sino-Tibetan, which includes the languages of northern and southern China as well as those of Tibet and Burma.49

The field of historical linguistics got its start in 1786, when a British scholar living in India, Sir William Jones, noticed similarities between Sanskrit, a language spoken and written in ancient India, and classical Greek, Latin, and more recent European languages.50 In 1822, Jakob Grimm, one of the brothers Grimm of fairy tale fame, formulated rules to describe the sound shifts that had occurred when the various Indo-European languages diverged from each other. So, for example, in English and the other languages in the Germanic branch of the Indo-European family, *d* regularly shifted to *t* (compare the English *two* and *ten* with the Latin *duo* and *decem*), and *p* regularly shifted to *f* (compare the English *father* and *foot,* to Latin's *pater* and *pes*). Scholars generally agree that the Indo-European languages derive from a language spoken 5,000 years to 6,000 years ago.51 The ancestral Indo-European language, many of whose features have now been reconstructed, is called *proto-Indo-European,* or *PIE* for short.

Where did PIE originate? Some linguists believe that the approximate location of a protolanguage is suggested by the words for plants and animals in the derived languages. More specifically, among these different languages, the words that are **cognates**—that is, words that are similar in sound and meaning—presumably refer to plants and animals that were present in the original homeland. So, if we know where those animals and plants were located 5,000 years to 6,000 years ago, we can guess where PIE people lived. Among all the cognates for trees in the Indo-European languages, Paul Friedrich has identified 18 that he

On this basis, he suggests that the eastern Ukraine was the PIE homeland.<sup>52</sup> Also consistent with this hypothesis is the fact that the Balto-Slavic subfamily of Indo-European, which includes most of the languages in and around the former Soviet Union, has the most tree names (compared with other subfamilies) that are similar to the reconstructed form in proto-Indo-European.<sup>53</sup>

Marija Gimbutas thinks we can even identify the proto-Indo-Europeans archaeologically. She believes that the PIE people were probably the people associated with what is known as the Kurgan culture (5000 b.c. to 2000 b.c.), which spread out from the Ukraine around 3000 b.c. The Kurgan people were herders, raising horses, cattle, sheep, and pigs. They also relied on hunting and grain cultivation. Burials suggest differences in wealth and special status for men.54 Why the Kurgan and linguistically similar people were able to expand to many places in Europe and the Near East is not yet clear. Some have suggested that horses and horse-drawn wagons and perhaps horseback riding provided important military advantages.55 In any case, it is clear that many Kurgan cultural elements were distributed after 3000 b.c. over a wide area of the Old World.

Colin Renfrew disagrees with the notion that the Ukraine was the homeland of PIE. He thinks that PIE is 2,000 years to 3,000 years older than Kurgan culture and that the PIE people lived in a different place. Renfrew locates the PIE homeland in eastern Anatolia (Turkey) in 7000 b.c. to 6000 b.c., and he suggests, on the basis of archaeological evidence, that the spread of Indo-European to Europe and what is now Iran, Afghanistan, and India accompanied the spread of farming to those areas.56

Just as some historical linguists and archaeologists have suggested when and where the PIE people may have lived originally and how they may have spread, other linguists and archaeologists have suggested culture histories for other language families. For example, the Bantu languages in Africa (spoken by perhaps 100 million people) form a subfamily of the larger Niger-Congo family of languages. Bantu speakers currently live in a wide band across the center of Africa and down the eastern and western sides of southern Africa. All of the Bantu languages presumably derive from people who spoke proto-Bantu. But where was their homeland?

This 16th century painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder depicts the well-known story of the Tower of Babel in the biblical Book of Genesis. From an anthropologist's viewpoint, the story of the tower is one of several ancient examples, among them a Mayan and a Sumerian text, that strive to explain the diversity of the world's languages. The idea that humans spoke one language before they dispersed across the world remains a popular theory among anthropological linguists

As in the case of proto-Indo-European, different theories have been proposed. But most historical linguists now agree with Joseph Greenberg's suggestion that the origin of Bantu was in what is now the Middle Benue area of eastern Nigeria.57 The point of origin is presumably where there is the greatest diversity of related languages and *dialects* (varying forms of a language); it is assumed that the place of origin has had the most time for linguistic diversity to develop, compared with an area only recently occupied by a related language. For example, England has more dialect diversity than New Zealand or Australia.

Why were the Bantu able to spread so widely over the last few thousand years? Anthropologists have only begun to guess.58 Initially, the Bantu probably kept goats and practiced some form of agriculture and thereby were able to spread, displacing huntergatherers in the area. As the Bantu speakers expanded, they began to cultivate certain cereal crops and herd sheep and cattle. Around this time, after 1000 b.c., they also began to use and make iron tools, which may have given them significant advantages. In any case, by 1,500 years to 2,000 years ago, Bantu speakers had spread throughout central Africa and into the northern reaches of southern Africa. But speakers of non-Bantu languages still live in eastern, southern, and southwestern Africa.

# The Processes of Linguistic Divergence

Historical or comparative linguists hope to do more than record and date linguistic divergence. Just as physical anthropologists may attempt to develop explanations for human variation, so linguists investigate the possible causes of linguistic variation. Some of the divergence undoubtedly comes about gradually. When groups of people speaking the same language lose communication with one another because they become separated, either physically or socially, they begin to accumulate small changes in phonology, morphology, and syntax (which occur continuously in any language). These variant forms of language are considered **dialects** when the differences in phonology, morphology, and syntax are not great enough to produce unintelligibility. (Dialects should not be confused with accents, which are merely differences in pronunciation.) Eventually, if the separation continues, the former dialects of the same language will become separate languages; that is, they will become mutually unintelligible, as German and English now are. Just as culture change originates from individual changes, language change originates from individual speakers, either from spontaneous innovation or from borrowing. Only when innovative speech patterns are picked up by others does linguistic change occur.59

Geographic barriers, such as large bodies of water, deserts, and mountains, may separate speakers of what was once the same language, but distance by itself can also produce divergence. For example, if we compare dialects of English in the British Isles, it is clear that the regions farthest away from each other are the most different linguistically (compare the northeast of Scotland and London).60 In northern India, hundreds of semiisolated villages and regions developed hundreds of local dialects. Today, the inhabitants of each village understand the dialects of the surrounding villages and, with a little more difficulty, the dialects of the next circle of villages. But slight dialect shifts accumulate village by village, and it seems as if different languages are being spoken at the opposite ends of the region, which are separated by more than a thousand miles.61

Even where there is little geographic separation, there may still be a great deal of dialect differentiation because of social distance. So, for example, the spread of a linguistic feature may be halted by religious, class, or other social differences that inhibit communication.62 In the village of Khalapur in northern India, John Gumperz found substantial differences in speech between the Untouchables and other groups. Members of the Untouchables have work contacts with members of other groups but no friendships.63 Without friendships and the easy communication between friends, dialect differentiation can readily develop.

Whereas isolation brings gradual divergence between speech communities, contact results in greater resemblance. This effect is particularly evident when contact between mutually unintelligible languages introduces borrowed words, which usually name some new item

14.5 Identify the processes by which languages diverge.

**Dialects** A variety of a language spoken in a particular area or by a particular social group.

borrowed from the other culture—*tomato, canoe, sushi,* and so on. Bilingual groups within a culture may also introduce foreign words, especially when the mainstream language has no real equivalent. Thus, *salsa* has come into English, and *le weekend* into French.

Conquest and colonization often result in extensive and rapid borrowing, if not linguistic replacement. The Norman conquest of England introduced French as the language of the new aristocracy. It was 300 years before the educated classes began to write in English. During this time, the English borrowed words from French and Latin, and the two languages—English and French—became more alike than they would otherwise have been. About 50 percent of the English general vocabulary originated in French. As this example suggests, different social classes may react to language contact differentially. For example, English aristocrats eventually called their meat "pork" and "beef" (derived from the French words), but the people who raised the animals and prepared them for eating continued (at least for a while) to refer to the meat as "pig" and "bull," the original Anglo-Saxon words.

In those 300 years of extensive contact, the grammar of English remained relatively stable. English lost most of its inflections or case endings, but it adopted little of the French grammar. In general, the borrowing of words, particularly free morphemes,64 is much more common than the borrowing of grammar.65 As we might expect, borrowing by one language from another can make the borrowing language more different from its *sibling languages* (those derived from a common ancestral language) than it would otherwise be. Partly as a result of the French influence, the English vocabulary looks quite different from the languages to which it is actually most similar in terms of phonology and grammar—German, Dutch, and the Scandinavian languages.

# Relationships Between Language and Culture

Some attempts to explain the diversity of languages have focused on the possible interactions between language and other aspects of culture. On the one hand, if it can be shown that a culture can affect the structure and content of its language, then it would follow that linguistic diversity derives at least in part from cultural diversity. On the other hand, the direction of influence between culture and language might work in reverse: Linguistic features and structures might affect other aspects of the culture.

#### Cultural Influences on Language

One way a society's language may reflect its corresponding culture is in **lexical content**, or vocabulary. Which experiences, events, or objects are singled out and given words may be a result of cultural characteristics.

Basic Words for Colors, Plants, and Animals Early in the 20th century, many linguists pointed to the lexical domain (vocabulary) of color words to illustrate the supposed truth that languages vary arbitrarily or without apparent reason. Different languages not only had different numbers of basic color words (from 2 to 12 or so; e.g., the words *red, green,* and *blue* in English), but they also, it was thought, had no consistency in the way they classified or divided the colors of the spectrum. But findings from a comparative (cross-linguistic) study contradicted these traditional presumptions about variation in the number and meaning of basic color words. On the basis of their study of at first 20, then over 100 languages, Brent Berlin and Paul Kay found that languages did not encode color in completely arbitrary ways. Moreover, they suggested that there appears to be a nearly universal sequence by which basic color terms evolve.66 Paul Kay and his collaborators followed up these earlier studies with a three-decade field study that included 110 additional unwritten languages. Although they added refinements, the later work supports the idea that a culture's basic color words evolve in predictable stages.67

Although different languages do have different numbers of basic color words, most speakers of any language are very likely to point to the same color chips as the best representatives

14.6 Discuss the relationship between language and culture.

**Lexical content** Vocabulary or lexicon. of particular colors. Moreover, a culture's set of basic color terms evolves through seven more or less predictable stages of refinement from 2 to 11 colors.68 If a language has just two basic color words, its speakers will always refer to "black" (or dark) hues and "white" (or light) hues. (Figure 14.3 shows a graphical representation of the proposed evolutionary stages of the development of basic color words.) Speakers of the language will also uniformly associate black with "cold" colors, among which they include blue, green, and purple, while they group red, orange, yellow, and pink, with "warm" white. If a language has three basic color words, the third word will nearly always be "red." (Why red comes third remains unclear.) The next category to appear is either "yellow" or "grue" (green/ blue), then different words for green and blue, and so on. To be sure, we usually do not see the process by which basic color words are added to a language. But we can infer the usual sequence because, for example, if a language has a word for "yellow," it will almost always have a word

![](_page_20_Figure_2.jpeg)

![](_page_20_Figure_3.jpeg)

for "red," whereas having a word for "red" does not mean that the language will have a word for "yellow."

What exactly is a *basic* color word? All languages, even the ones with only two basic color terms, have many different ways of expressing how color varies. For example, in English, we have words such as *turquoise, blue-green, scarlet, crimson,* and *sky blue.* Linguists do not consider these to be basic color words. In English, the basic color words are *white, black, red, green, yellow, blue, brown, pink, purple, orange,* and *gray.* One feature of a basic color word is that it consists of a single morph; it cannot include two or more units of meaning. This feature eliminates combinations such as *blue-green* and *sky blue.* A second feature of a basic color word is that the color it represents is not generally included in a higher-order color term. For example, scarlet and crimson are usually considered variants of red, turquoise a variant of blue. A third feature is that basic terms tend to be the first-named words when people are asked for color words. Finally, for a word to be considered a basic color word, many individual speakers of the language have to agree on the central meaning (in the color spectrum) of the word.69

Why do different societies (languages) vary in number of basic color terms? Berlin and Kay suggest that the number of basic color terms in a language increases with technological specialization as color is used to decorate and distinguish objects.70 Cross-linguistic variation in the number of basic color terms does not mean that some languages make more color distinctions than others. Every language could make a particular distinction by combining words (e.g., "fresh leaf" for green); a language need not have a separate basic term for that color.

There may also be many basic color terms because of a biological factor.71 Peoples with darker (more pigmented) eyes seem to have more trouble distinguishing colors at the dark (blue-green) end of the spectrum than do peoples with lighter eyes. It might be expected, then, that peoples who live nearer the equator (who tend to have darker eyes, presumably for protection against damaging ultraviolet radiation) would tend to have fewer basic color terms. And they do.72 Moreover, it seems that both cultural and biological factors are required to account for cross-linguistic variation in the number of basic color terms. Societies tend to have six or more such terms (with separate terms for blue and green) only when they are relatively far from the equator and only when their cultures are more technologically specialized.73 As we will see in later chapters, technological specialization tends to go with larger communities, more centralized governments, occupational specialization, and more social inequality. Societies with such traits are often referred to in a shorthand way as more "complex," which should not be taken to mean "better."

Echoing Berlin and Kay's finding that basic color terms seem to be added in a more or less universal sequence, Cecil Brown has found what seem to be developmental sequences in other lexical domains. Two such domains are general, or *life-form,* terms for plants and for animals. Life-form terms are higher-order classifications. All languages have lower-order terms for specific plants and animals. For example, English has words such as *oak, pine, sparrow,* and *salmon.* English speakers make finer distinctions too—*pin oak, white pine, white-throated sparrow,* and *red salmon.* But why, in some languages, do people have a larger number of general terms such as *tree, bird,* and *fish?* It seems that these general terms show a universal developmental sequence too. That is, general terms seem to be added in a somewhat consistent order. After "plant" comes a term for "tree"; then one for "grerb" (small, green, leafy, nonwoody plant); then "bush" (for plants between tree and grerb in size); then "grass"; then "vine."74 The life-form terms for animals also seem to be added in sequence; after "animal" comes a term for "fish," then "bird," then "snake," then "wug" (for small creatures other than fish, birds, and snakes—e.g., worms and bugs), then "mammal."<sup>75</sup>

More complex societies tend to have a larger number of general, or life-form, terms for plants and animals than do simpler societies, just as they tend to have a larger number of basic color terms. Why? And do all realms or domains of vocabulary increase in size as social complexity increases? If we look at the total vocabulary of a language (as can be counted in a dictionary), more complex societies do have larger vocabularies.76 But we have to remember that complex societies have many kinds of specialists, and dictionaries will include the terms such specialists use. If we look instead at the nonspecialist, **core vocabulary** of languages, it seems that all languages have a core vocabulary of about the same size.77 Indeed, although some domains increase in size with social complexity, some remain the same and still others decrease. An example of a smaller vocabulary domain in complex societies is that of specific names for plants. Urban North Americans may know general terms for plants, but they know relatively few names for specific plants. The typical individual in a small-scale society can commonly name 400 to 800 plant species; a typical person in our own and similar societies may be able to name only 40 to 80.78 The number of life-form terms is larger in societies in which ordinary people know less about particular plants and animals.79

The evidence now available strongly supports the idea that the vocabulary of a language reflects the everyday distinctions that are important in the society. Those aspects of environment or culture that are of special importance will receive greater attention in the language.

Grammar Most of the examples we could accumulate would show that a culture influences the names of things visible in its environment. Evidence for cultural influence on the grammatical structure of a language is less extensive. Harry Hoijer draws attention to the verb categories in the language of the Navajo, a traditionally nomadic people. These categories center mainly in the reporting of events, or "eventings," as he calls them. Hoijer notes that, in "the reporting of actions and events, and the framing of substantive concepts, Navajo emphasizes movement and specifies the nature, direction, and status of such movement in considerable detail."80 For example, Navajo has one category for eventings that are in motion and another for eventings that have ceased moving. Hoijer concludes that the emphasis on events in the process of occurring reflects the Navajo's nomadic experience over the centuries, an experience also reflected in their myths and folklore.

A linguistic emphasis on events may or may not be generally characteristic of nomadic peoples; as yet, no one has investigated the matter cross-culturally or comparatively. But there are indications that systematic comparative research would turn up other grammatical features that are related to cultural characteristics. For example, many languages lack the possessive transitive verb we write as "have," as in "I have." Instead, the language may say something such as "it is to me." A cross-cultural study has suggested that a language may develop the verb "have" after the speakers of that language have developed a system of private property or personal ownership of resources.81 The concept of private property is far from universal and tends to occur only in complex societies with social inequality. In contrast, many societies have some kind of communal ownership, by kin groups or communities. How people talk about owning seems to reflect how they own; societies that lack a concept of private property also lack the verb "have."

**Core vocabulary** Nonspecialist vocabulary.

#### Linguistic Influences on Culture: The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis

There is general agreement that culture influences language. But there is less agreement about the opposite possibility—that language influences other aspects of culture. Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf suggested that language is a force in its own right, that it affects how individuals in a society perceive and conceive reality. This suggestion is known as the *Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.*82 In comparing the English language with Hopi, Whorf pointed out that English-language categories convey discreteness with regard to time and space, but Hopi does not. English has a discrete past, present, and future, and things occur at a definite time. Hopi expresses things with more of an idea of ongoing processes without time being apportioned into fixed segments. According to Ronald Wardhaugh, Whorf believed that these language differences lead Hopi and English speakers to see the world differently.83

As intriguing as that idea is, the relevant evidence is mixed. Linguists today do not generally accept the view that language coerces thought, but some suspect that particular features of language may facilitate certain patterns of thought.84 The influences may be clearest in poetry and metaphors, where words and phrases are applied to other than their ordinary subjects, as in "all the world's a stage."85 One of the serious problems in testing the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is that researchers need to figure out how to separate the effects of other aspects of culture from the effects of language.

One approach that may reveal the direction of influence between language and culture is to study how children in different cultures (speaking different languages) develop concepts as they grow up. If language influences the formation of a particular concept, we might expect that children will acquire that concept earlier in societies where the languages emphasize that concept. For example, some languages make more of gender differences than others. Do children develop gender identity earlier when their language emphasizes gender? (Very young girls and boys seem to believe they can switch genders by dressing in opposite-sex clothes, suggesting that they have not yet developed a stable sense that they are unchangeably girls or boys.) Alexander Guiora and his colleagues have studied children growing up in Hebrew-speaking homes (Israel), English-speaking homes (the United States), and Finnish-speaking homes (Finland). Hebrew has the most gender emphasis of the three languages; all nouns are either masculine or feminine, and even second-person and plural pronouns are differentiated by gender. English emphasizes gender less, differentiating by gender only in the third-person singular (*she* or *her* or *hers; he* or *him* or *his*). Finnish emphasizes gender the least; although some words, such as *man* and *woman,* convey gender, differentiation by gender is otherwise lacking in the language. Consistent with the idea that language may influence thought, Hebrew-speaking children acquire the concept of stable gender identity the earliest on the average, Finnish-speaking children the latest.<sup>86</sup>

Another approach is to predict from language differences how people may be expected to perform in experiments. Comparing the Yucatec Mayan language and English, John Lucy predicted that English speakers might recall the *number* of things presented more than Yucatec Mayan speakers. For most classes of nouns, English requires a linguistic way of indicating whether something is singular or plural. You cannot say "I have dog" (no indication of number), but must say "I have a dog," "I have dogs," or "I have one (two, three, several, many) dogs." Yucatec Maya, like English, can indicate a plural, but it allows the noun to be neutral with regard to number. For example, the translated phrase thereis-dog-over-there (*yàan pèek té'elo'*) can be left ambiguous about whether there is one or more than one dog. In English, the same ambiguity would occur in the sentence "I saw deer over there," but English does not often allow ambiguity for animate or inanimate nouns.87 In a number of experiments, Yucatec Mayan and American English speakers were equally likely to recall the objects in a picture, but they differed in how often they described the number of a particular object in the picture. Yucatec Mayan speakers did so less often, consistent with their language's lack of insistence on indicating number.<sup>88</sup> So the salience of number in the experiments was probably a consequence of how the languages differ. Of course, it is possible that salience of number is created by some other cultural feature, such as dependence on money in the economy.

# The Ethnography of Speaking

Until the early 1960s, linguistic anthropologists concentrated on understanding the structure of the language spoken in a society, particularly those lacking writing. They focused on the linguistic features of the language, such as its phonology, morphology, and syntax. Those interested in historical relationships between languages compared their structures to try to understand linguistic ancestry and divergence. In recent years, many linguists have begun to conduct fieldwork to study what people actually say and how they use language. The focus is on "speech" or "communicative events" to describe the context, who can participate, what topics are discussed, and how people present themselves. The main goal of an *ethnography of speaking* is to find cultural and subcultural patterns of speech variation in different social contexts.89 We will consider in more detail how speech may vary by social status or gender, but analysis of speech events also helps reveal what is felt important to present or communicate.90 One sociolinguist might ask, for example, what the cultural functions of story-telling are in a Cree community and then record what occurs during an evening with an elder and his family, an occasion when a story is likely to be told.91 Another sociolinguist may look at hip-hop language to understand what it reveals not only about a musical movement but also about identity of a subcultural group in the United States.92

#### Social Status and Speech

That a foreign speaker of a language may know little about the small talk of that language is but one example of the sociolinguistic principle that what we say and how we say it are not wholly predictable by the rules of our language. Who we are socially and who we are talking to may greatly affect what we say and how we say it.

In a study interviewing children in a New England town, John Fischer noted that, in formal interviews, children were likely to pronounce the ending in words such as *singing* and *fishing,* but in informal conversations, they said *"singin'"* and *"fishin'."* Moreover, he noted that the phenomenon also appeared to be related to social class; children from higher-status families were less likely to drop the ending than were children from lowerstatus families. Subsequent studies in English-speaking areas tend to support Fischer's observations with regard to this speech pattern. Other patterns are observed as well. For example, in Norwich, England, lower classes tend to drop the *h* in words such as *hammer,* but in all classes, the pattern of dropping the *h* increases in casual situations.93 With respect to grammatical differences, in inner-city Detroit, lower-class African Americans are more likely to use double negatives as in "It ain't nobody's business," in contrast to middle-class African Americans who usually say "It isn't anybody's business."94

Research has shown that English people from higher-class backgrounds tend to have more *homogeneous* speech, conforming more to what is considered standard English (the type of speech heard on television or radio), whereas people from lower-class backgrounds have very *heterogeneous* speech, varying in their speaking according to the local or dialect area they come from.95 In some societies, social status differences may be associated with more marked differentiation of words. Clifford Geertz, in his study of Javanese, showed that the vocabularies of the three rather sharply divided groups in Javanese society—peasants, townspeople, and aristocrats—reflect their separate positions. For example, the concept *now* is expressed differently in these three groups. A peasant will use *saiki* (considered the lowest and roughest form of the word); a townsman will use *saniki* (considered somewhat more elegant); and an aristocrat will use *samenika* (the most elegant form).96

Status relationships between people can also influence the way they speak to each other. Terms of address are a good example. In English, forms of address are relatively simple. One is called either by a first name or by a title (such as *Doctor, Professor, Ms.,* or *Mister*) followed by a last name. A study by Roger Brown and Marguerite Ford indicates that terms of address in English vary with the nature of the relationship between the speakers.97 The reciprocal use of first names generally signifies an informal or intimate relationship between two people. A title and last name used reciprocally usually indicates a more formal or businesslike relationship between individuals who are roughly equal in status. Nonreciprocal use of first names and titles in English is reserved for speakers who

recognize a marked difference in status between them. This status difference can be a function of age, as when a child refers to her mother's friend as Mrs. Miller and is in turn addressed as Sally, or can be due to occupational hierarchy, as when a person refers to his boss as Ms. Ramirez and is in turn addressed as Joe. In some cases, generally between boys and between men, the use of the last name alone represents a middle ground between the intimate and the formal usages.

#### Gender Differences in Speech

In many societies, the speech of men differs from the speech of women. The variation can be slight, as in our own society, or more extreme, as with the Carib Indians in the Lesser Antilles of the West Indies, among whom women and men use different words for the same concepts.98 In Japan, males and females use entirely different words for numerous concepts (e.g., the male word for water is *mizu;* the female version is *ohiya*), and females often add the polite prefix *o-* (females will tend to say *ohasi* for chopsticks; males will tend to say *hasi*).99 In the United States and other Western societies, there are differences in the speech of females and males, but they are not as dramatic as in the Carib and Japanese cases. For example, earlier we noted the tendency for the *g* to be dropped in words such as *singing* when the situation is informal and when the social class background is lower. But there is also a gender difference. Women are more likely than men to keep the *g* sound and less likely than men to drop the *h* in words such as *happy.* In Montreal, women are less likely than men to drop the *l* in phrases such as *il fait* ("he does") or in the idiom *il y a* ("there is/are").100 And in Detroit, in each social class, African American women are less likely than men to use double negatives.101

Gender differences occur in intonation and in phrasing of sentences as well. Robin Lakoff found that, in English, women tend to answer questions with sentences that have rising inflections at the end instead of a falling intonation associated with a firm answer. Women also tend to add questions to statements, such as "They caught the robber last week, didn't they?"102

One explanation for the gender differences, particularly with regard to pronunciation, is that women in many societies may be more concerned than men with being "correct."103 (This is not in the linguist's sense; it is important to remember that linguists do not consider one form of speech more correct than another, just as they do not consider one dialect superior to another. All are equally capable of expressing a complex variety of thoughts and ideas.) In societies with social classes, what is considered more correct by the average person may be what is associated with the upper class. In other societies, what is older may be considered more correct. For example, in the Native American language of Koasati, which used to be spoken in Louisiana, males and females used different endings in certain verbs. The differences seemed to be disappearing in the 1930s, when the research on Koasati was done. Young girls had begun to use the male forms, and

![](_page_24_Picture_6.jpeg)

Strangers shake hands when they meet; friends may touch each other more warmly. How we speak to others also differs according to the degree of friendship.

only older women still used the female forms. Koasati men said that the women's speech was a "better" form of speech.<sup>104</sup> Gender differences in speech may parallel some of the gender differences noted in other social behavior (as we will see in the chapter on sex and gender): Girls are more likely than boys to behave in ways that are acceptable to adults.

There are not enough studies to know just how common it is for women to exhibit more linguistic "correctness." We do know of some instances where it is not the case. For example, in a community in Madagascar where people speak Merina, a dialect of Malagasy, it is considered socially correct to avoid explicit directives. So, instead of directly ordering an action, a Merina speaker will try to say it indirectly. Also, it is polite to avoid negative remarks, such as expressing anger, toward someone. In this community, however, women, not men, often break the rules; women speak more directly and express anger more often. $^{105}$  This difference may be related to the fact that women are more involved in buying and selling in the marketplace.

Some researchers have questioned whether it is correctness that is at issue. Rather, we may be dealing in these examples with unequal prestige and power. Women may try to

### **Perspectives on Gender**

#### Blatelas

#### **Does the English Language Promote Sexist Thinking?**

oes English promote sexist thinking, or does the language merely reflect gender inequalities that already exist? For those who wish to promote gender equality, the answers to these questions are important because, if language influences thought (along the lines put forward by Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf), then linguistic change will be necessary to bring about change in the culture of gender. If it is the other way around, that is, if language reflects inequality, then social, economic, and political changes have to come before we can expect substantial linguistic change to occur.

Leaving aside for the moment which changes first, how does English represent gender inequity? Consider the following written by Benjamin Lee Whorf: "Speech is the best show man puts on. . . . Language helps man in his thinking." Although man in English technically refers to all humans and his technically refers to the thinking of a single person of either gender, the frequent use of such words could convey the idea that males are more important. Do the words chairman and *policeman* convey that males are supposed to have those jobs? What is conveyed when there are two words for the two genders, as hero and heroine? Usually the base word is male and the suffix is added for the female form. Does the suffix convey that the

female form is an afterthought or less important?

It is not just the structure of the language that may convey gender inequality. How come in the pairs sir/madam, master/mistress, wizard/ witch, the female version has acquired negative connotations? Coming back to the original questions, how would we know whether language promotes sexism or sexism influences lanquage? One way to find out is to do experimental studies, such as the one conducted by Fatemeh Khosroshashi. Some individuals were asked to read texts written with man, he, and his referring to people; others were asked to read texts with more gender-neutral phrasing. Individuals were subsequently asked to draw pictures to go with the texts. The ones who read the texts with more male terminology drew more accompanying pictures of men, strongly suggesting that the use of the terms *man*, *he*, and *his* conveyed the thought that the people in the text were men, not women, because of the vocabulary used.

It would be important to know whether societies with more "maleoriented" language are more maledominated than other societies. We don't have that kind of comparative research yet. But one study by Robert and Ruth Munroe looked at the *proportion* of female and male nouns in 10 languages (including six Indo-European languages) in which nouns have gender. The Munroes asked whether those societies with less male bias in social customs (e.g., all children are equally likely to inherit property) had a higher proportion of female nouns than male nouns (more female than male nouns). The answer appears to be yes. Studies like it are important if we want to discover how language differences may be related to other aspects of culture. If male-oriented languages are not related to male dominance, then it is not likely that sexist thinking is a consequence of language.

On the assumption that language may influence thought, many are pushing for changes in the way English is used, if not structured. It is hard to get English speakers to adopt a gender-neutral singular pronoun to replace he. Attempts to do so go back to the 18th century and include suggestions of tey, thon, per, and s/he. Although these efforts have not succeeded, the way English is written and spoken has begun to change. Words or phrases such as *chair* (or *chairperson*) or police officerman versions. If Whorf were writing his sentence now, it probably would be written: "Speech is the best show humans put on.... Language helps people think."

raise their status by conforming more to standard speech. When they answer a question with a rising inflection, they may be expressing uncertainty and a lack of power. Alternatively, perhaps women want to be more cooperative conversationalists. Speaking in a more "standard" fashion is consistent with being more likely to be understood by others. Answering a question with another question leads to continued conversation.106

It is popular wisdom that men and women typically differ in what they do or do not talk about. Deborah Tannen has studied gender differences in speaking patterns and found evidence that supports this belief. For example, when women hear about someone else's troubles, they are likely to express empathy. In contrast, men are likely to offer solutions. Men tend not to ask for directions; women do. Women tend to talk a lot in private settings; men talk more in public settings. These and other differences can cause friction and misunderstanding between the genders. When women express their troubles and men offer solutions, women feel that their feelings are not understood; men are frustrated that the women do not take their solutions seriously. Men may prefer to sit at home quietly and feel put upon to have to engage in conversation; women feel slighted when men avoid extended conversations with them. Why these differences? Tannen suggests that misunderstanding between men and women arises because boys and girls grow up in somewhat different cultures. Girls typically play in small groups, talk frequently, and are intimate with others. Boys more often play in large groups in which jockeying for status and attention is more of a concern. In these groups, they learn that higher-status individuals give rather than seek directions and solutions. Because large play groups resemble public settings, later in life, men feel more comfortable speaking in public, whereas women are typically more comfortable speaking in small, intimate groups.107

#### Multilingualism and Code-Switching

For many people, the ability to speak more than one language is a normal part of life. One language may be spoken at home and another in school, the marketplace, or government. Or more than one language may be spoken at home if family members come from different cultures and still other languages are spoken outside. Some countries explicitly promote multilingualism. Singapore, for example, has four official languages—English, Mandarin (one of the Chinese languages), Tamil, and Malay. English is stressed for trade, Mandarin as the language of communication with most of China, Malay as the language of the general region, and Tamil as the language of an important ethnic group. Moreover, most of the population speaks Hokkien, another Chinese language. Education is likely to be in English and Mandarin.108

What happens when people who know two or more languages communicate with each other? Very often you find them **code-switching**, using more than one language in the course of conversing.109 Switching can occur in the middle of a Spanish-English bilingual sentence, as in "No van a bring it up in the meeting" ("They are not going to bring it up in the meeting").110 Or switching can occur when the topic or situation changes, such as from social talk to schoolwork. Why do speakers of more than one language sometimes switch? Although speakers switch for a lot of different reasons, what is clear is that the switching is not a haphazard mix that comes from laziness or ignorance. Code-switching involves a great deal of knowledge of two or more languages and an awareness of what is considered appropriate or inappropriate in the community. For example, in the Puerto Rican community in New York City, code-switching within the same sentence seems to be common in speech among friends, but if a stranger who looks like a Spanish speaker approaches, the language will shift entirely to Spanish.111

Although each community may have its own rules for code-switching, variations in practice can depend upon the broader political and historical context. Why do German speakers in Transylvania, for example, rarely code-switch to Romanian, the region's national language? Perhaps it is because they historically viewed Romanians as inferior in status. Germans settled in Transylvania as colonists in the 12th and 13th centuries, not long before semi-nomadic Romanians also settled there. However, for centuries afterwards the Germans—or Saxons, as they were called—were given greater privileges by the Hungarian and Austrian rulers of the region. Germans and Hungarians could own land, but the Romanians could not and effectively became the serf class. The

Romanian population would see its fortunes rise when the Austro-Hungarian Empire came to an end in World War I and Transylvania was annexed by Romania. When Romania became part of the Soviet bloc after World War II, the German speakers, for their part, would lose their economic privilege. Yet they continued to speak German without code-switching among themselves. In the rare cases that Romanian was used among the German speakers, it tended to be associated with such low-status speech as singing bawdy songs.

An opposite reaction occurred in a Hungarian region of German-speaking Austria. The people of this agricultural region, annexed to Austria in 1921, were fairly poor peasant farmers. After World War II, business expansion began to attract labor from rural areas, and many Hungarians eagerly moved into jobs in industry. Younger generations saw German as a symbol of higher status and upward mobility; not surprisingly, code-switching between Hungarian and German became part of their conversations. Indeed, for the third generation, German has become the language of choice, except when they are speaking to the oldest Hungarians. The Hungarian-Austrian pattern, where the language of the politically dominant group becomes "linguistically dominant," is common in many parts of the world.112

14.8 Identify the origins of writing and literacy, and assess the impact of writing and literacy on culture and communication.

# Writing and Literacy

Most of us have come to depend on writing for so many things that it is hard to imagine a world without it. Yet humans spent most of their history on earth without written language, and many, if not most, important human achievements predate written language. Parents and other teachers passed on their knowledge by oral instruction and demonstration. Stories, legends, and myths abounded—the stuff we call oral literature—even in the absence of writing. This is not to say that writing is not important. Far more information and far more literature can be preserved for a longer period of time with a writing system. The earliest writing systems are only about 6,000 years old and are associated with early cities and states. Early writing is associated with systematic record-keeping—keeping of ledgers for inventorying goods and transactions. In early times, probably only the elite could read and write—indeed, only recently has universal literacy (the ability to read and write) become the goal of most countries. But in most countries, the goal of universal

literacy is far from achieved. Even in countries with universal education, the quality of education and the length of education vary considerably between subcultures and genders. Just as some ways of speaking are considered superior to others, a high degree of literacy is usually considered superior to illiteracy.113 But literacy in what language or languages? As we discussed in the box on endangered languages, recent efforts to preserve languages have encouraged writing of texts in languages that were only spoken previously. Obviously, there will be few texts in those languages; other languages have vast numbers of written texts. As more accumulated knowledge is written and stored in books, journals, and databases, attainment of literacy in those written languages will be increasingly critical to success. And texts do not only convey practical knowledge—they may also convey attitudes, beliefs, and values that are characteristic of the culture associated with the language in which the texts are written.

# Summary and Review

### Communication

14.1 Define *communication*, and compare and contrast human and nonhuman communication.

- • There are many ways in which information is exchanged or imparted, but all systems of communication require a common and shared system of symbols, signs, or behaviors.
- • Humans rely heavily on spoken language to communicate, and it is probably the major way culture is transmitted. Any system of language consists of publicly accepted symbols by which individuals try to share private experiences and thoughts, but human language is much more than symbolic communication.
- • All human languages are thought to use a large set of symbols that can be combined to produce new meanings (open system), communicate about past and future events, apply linguistic rules for combinations of sounds, and have many kinds of discourse.
- • Human communication happens directly through spoken language; indirectly through "body language"; with nonverbal symbolic systems such as writing, algebraic equations, musical scores, and road signs; and through art, music, and dance.
- • Some direct nonverbal communication appears to be universal in humans. Humans worldwide seem able to recognize a happy, sad, surprised, angry, disgusted, or afraid face. But many body and hand gestures are not universal.
- • Other animal species communicate through sound, chemicals, and body movement. Some animals use symbolic communication; there is general agreement that humans have much more complexity in their systems of communication, but there is debate about how profound the differences are.

In what ways do human and nonhuman communication differ?

### The Origins of Language

14.2 Explain how the study of creole and pidgin languages and of children's acquisition of language might tell us something about the origins of language.

- • Unambiguous evidence of human language dates back to 5,000 years ago, but it likely existed 50,000 years ago and may possibly have been used by humans as well Neandertals.
- • Actual development of language is neither completely biologically determined nor dependent on a system of writing. Languages of simpler societies are equally as complex as those of developed societies.
- • All languages possess the amount of vocabulary their speakers need, and all languages expand in response to cultural changes.
- • Pidgin languages combine features of various languages but without basic components such as prepositions or auxiliary verbs. They may or may not develop into full languages.
- • Pidgin languages that do develop further (often through children) become creole languages, having grammar different from the source languages. Some argue that creole languages throughout the world have striking grammar similarities and may resemble early human languages.
- • A child is apparently equipped from birth with the capacity to reproduce all the sounds used by the world's languages and to learn any system of grammar, an ability that gives way to cultural influences around the age of 1 year.

### Descriptive Linguistics

14.3 Discuss the major components of descriptive linguistics (phonology, morphology, and syntax) and the key findings in each of these areas.

- • Grammar to the linguist consists of the actual, often unconscious, principles that predict how most people talk, which linguists study through phonology, morphology, and syntax.
- • Even though what people say is sometimes contradicted by their observed behavior, language is important to understanding the beliefs, attitudes, values, and worldview of a people. In many cases, behaviors also cannot be readily understood without verbal interpretation.

- • Linguists studying phonology write down speech utterances as sound sequences and then try to identify which sounds affect meaning, which sound sequences are allowed in a language, and what usually unconscious rules predict those sequences.
- • Morphology is the study of sequences of sounds that have meaning. The smallest unit of language that has a meaning is called a morph. One or more morphs with the same meaning may make up a morpheme.
- • The lexicon of a language consists of words and morphs and their meanings. A free morpheme can be a separate word. A bound morpheme displays its meaning only when attached to another morpheme.
- • Syntax reflects the rules that predict how phrases and sentences are generally formed. Speakers of a language follow implicit rules of syntax but are not usually consciously aware of them. The linguist's description of the syntax of a language makes these rules explicit.

### Historical Linguistics

14.4 Describe how historical linguistics establishes historical relationships between languages and language families.

- • Historical linguists focus on how languages change over time. Linguists can reconstruct changes that have occurred in a language, written or unwritten, by comparing contemporary languages that are similar.
- • Common ancestry, contact between speech communities, and the limited processes of linguistic change may explain why languages show similarities.
- • Languages that derive from the same protolanguage are called a language family. Most languages spoken today can be grouped into fewer than 30 families. Linguists still can reconstruct many features of a protolanguage by comparing the derived languages.
- • The location of a protolanguage may be suggested by the words for plants and animals in the derived languages. The locations of those animals and plants thousands of years ago may help researchers decipher the origins of the protolanguage.

How does historical linguistics establish relationships between languages and language families?

### The Processes of Linguistic Divergence

14.5 Identify the processes by which languages diverge.

- • When groups speaking the same language lose communication with one another through physical or social separation, they accumulate small changes in phonology, morphology, and syntax that lead to dialects and, with continued separation, to separate languages.
- • Isolation leads to divergence between speech communities, and contact leads to resemblance. Conquest and colonization often promote extensive and rapid linguistic borrowing or total replacement. Generally, words are borrowed more commonly than grammar.

How do languages diverge?

### Relationships Between Language and Culture

14.6 Discuss the relationship between language and culture.

- • A society's language may reflect its corresponding culture in lexical content or vocabulary.
- • Both cultural and biological factors influence the number of basic color terms. Societies tend to have six or more color terms only when they are relatively far from the equator and only when their cultures are more technologically specialized.
- • Ignoring terms that specialists use within a society, it seems that all languages have a core vocabulary of about the same size.
- • Current evidence supports the idea that the vocabulary of a language reflects the everyday distinctions that are important in the society. This finding may also be true of grammar.
- • Some evidence supports the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis that language affects how individuals in a society perceive and conceive reality, but more research is needed.

How are language and some other aspects of culture related?

### The Ethnography of Speaking

14.7 Discuss the relationship between ways of speaking and issues of class, gender, and ethnicity.

- • The main goal of an ethnography of speaking is to find cultural and subcultural patterns of speech variation in different social contexts.
- • Social status and whom a person is talking to may greatly affect what a person says and how it is said. Social status may predict variation in speech from "standard" speech, use and differentiation of certain words, and terms of address.
- • In many societies, the speech of men and women differs, particularly in terms of word choice, pronunciation, intonation, and phrasing. Some researchers are suggesting that these differences may be related to prestige and power.
- • In code-switching, speakers who know two or more languages in common purposefully use words and phrases from both languages in their speech. Each community may have its own rules for code-switching, and variations in practice can depend on political and historical context.

How do some ways of speaking vary by class, gender, and ethnicity?

### Writing and Literacy

14.8 Identify the origins of writing and literacy, and assess the impact of writing and literacy on culture and communication.

- • Humans spent most of their history on earth without written language, and many important human achievements predate written language. However, far more information and literature can be preserved for a longer period of time with a writing system.
- • The earliest writing systems are only about 6,000 years old and are associated with early cities and states. Early writing is associated with systematic record-keeping—keeping of ledgers for inventories of goods and transactions.
- • Universal literacy is far from achieved today. A high degree of literacy is usually considered superior to illiteracy.
- • As more accumulated knowledge is written and stored, attainment of literacy in those written languages will be increasingly critical to success. Texts convey not only practical knowledge but also attitudes, beliefs, and values that are characteristic of the related culture.

# Think on it

- 1. Why might natural selection have favored the development of true language in humans but not in apes?
- 2. Would the world be better off with many different languages spoken or with just one universal language? Why do you think so?
- 3. Discuss some new behavior or way of thinking that led people to adopt or invent new vocabulary or some new pattern of speech.
- 4. How does some aspect of your speech differ from your parents or others of the previous generation? Why do you think it has changed?
