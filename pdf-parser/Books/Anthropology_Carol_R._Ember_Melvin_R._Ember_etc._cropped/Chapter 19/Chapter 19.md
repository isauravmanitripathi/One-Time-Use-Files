arriage is customary in every society known to anthropologists, with only one or two exceptions. When a cultural institution is as common as marriage but apparently not absolutely essential to human survival—people can reproduce and have families without marriage—anthropologists ask *why*. One popular answer today might be that people marry for love. Many of us can recognize the adoration mixed with desire that compelled High Horse, a young Dakotan of North America, to want to marry Good Plume, a "beautiful" Cheyenne girl he had gotten to know:

#### ... I want her so much that I cannot eat and I cannot sleep, and if I do not get her, maybe I shall just starve to death.

But mere passion has in much of the world been frowned upon as the basis for as important a social contract as marriage. High Horse's friend, for example, was alarmed by his friend's lovesick delirium and determined to cure him.

We have no certain way of knowing how far back in time humans began to have more or less permanent male-female bonding or customary marriages, but physical anthropologists surmise that such bonds were possibly in place over a million years ago when early humans relied more heavily on hunting. Written records, which exist for only 5,000 years or so of human history, describe marriages—and divorces—in the early kingdoms of West Asia.<sup>2</sup> We do know that the fundamental concept of marriage is nearly universal, and in this chapter we will look at it in all its forms, for how one marries, whom one marries, and even how many people a person can be married to simultaneously vary from society to society. Indeed, although each marriage usually involves one pair at a time, most societies have allowed a man to be married to more than one woman at a time, and a few have allowed a woman more than one husband. And we will explore the debate over why humans marry.

Families are unequivocally universal, for all societies have parent-child groups. The form and size of the family, however, can also vary from society to society. Extended families with two or more related parent-child groups are the norm in a majority of societies, whereas others have smaller, independent families. Marriage is not necessarily the basis for family life. One-parent families are increasingly common in our own and other societies today. Although marriage has not disappeared in these places—it is still customary to marry—more individuals are choosing to have children without being married. Yet the majority of people continue to think that marriage and family belong together.

# Marriage

Marriage is customary in nearly every known society. The fact that it exists nearly everywhere does not mean **marriage** takes the same form or is recognized in similar ways. Marriage is a socially approved sexual and economic union, usually between a woman and a man. It is presumed, by both the couple and others, to be more or less permanent, and it subsumes reciprocal rights and obligations between the two spouses and between spouses and their future children.<sup>3</sup>

Marriage is a socially approved sexual union in that the couple's sexual relationship is implicitly understood and legitimated. A woman might say, "I want you to meet my husband," but she could not say, "I want you to meet my lover" without embarrassment in most societies. Although the union may one day end in divorce, couples in all societies enter into marriage expecting a long-term commitment. Implicit too in marriage are reciprocal rights and obligations regarding property, finances, and childrearing. As George Peter Murdock noted, "Sexual relations can occur without economic cooperation, and there can be a division of labor between men and women without sex. But marriage unites the economic and the sexual."<sup>4</sup>

As we will see, societies have had a variety of marriage practices. Customs marking the onset of the union—the nuptials or wedding ceremony—may have been elaborate and lasted for several days or have hardly existed. A Ho-Chunk (or Winnebago) bride, for example, experienced no formal wedding ceremony. If the marriage was arranged by 19.1 Define marriage in anthropological terms.

The bride's relatives arrive at the groom's home bearing gifts and Piki bread from the bride's family at a traditional Hopi engagement ceremony in Arizona.

the couple's parents, as was customary, the families would exchange presents when the engagement was made, and then the groom would move in with the bride's family, where he might stay for two years as a dutiful son-inlaw before returning to his own home with his wife. If the couple eloped, the marriage might be even less ceremonious. One man, Crashing Thunder, recalled eloping with a young woman at his grandfather's instructions:

*I told her of my intention and asked her to go home with me. . . . After a while she came back all dressed up and ready. She had on a waist covered with silver buckles and a beautifully colored hair ornament and she wore many strings of beads around her neck, and bracelets around her wrists. Her fingers were covered with rings and she wore a pair of ornamental leggings. She wore a wideflap ornamented moccasin and in each ear she* 

*had about half a dozen ear holes and they were full of small silver pieces made into ear ornaments. She was painted also. She had painted her cheeks red and the parting of her hair red.*

Crashing Thunder takes his resplendent bride home on horseback but stops along the way for a singing engagement with his band. Because they have eloped "and that is the custom," he has his bride hide under "a small oak bush" for the night. It rains all night, and she is "soaked through and through" when Crashing Thunder returns the next day to retrieve her. When they arrive at his grandfather's house, the bride takes off her finery and gives it to her in-laws, who give her "other clothing to wear." And that is that.5

### The Na and Nayar Exceptions

We say that marriage is customary in almost all societies, but there are some interesting exceptions. Two are the Na of China and, in the 19th century, the Nayar subcaste of India.

The Na of Yunnan in southwest China, with a population of about 40,000, have customarily not married or lived with their sexual partners. Rather, men and women lived their entire lives in residential groups made up of their respective maternal kin (grandmother, great-uncles, brothers, sisters, and their children). The maternal household cooperated economically and raised the children. The Na practice *sese,* the consensual sexual union of an unmarried couple.6 When a couple agrees to see each other, the man visits the woman discreetly in the evening and returns to his own residence the next morning. No other tie exists between the lovers, nor is there any expectation that the relationship be longstanding or monogamous. The offspring of such relationships normally take the woman's family name and are raised by her family.

However, the Chinese government has tried off and on since 1959 to impose marriage among the Na and even to fine them for illegitimate births, but without much success. Traditionally, only a few women and men, usually of the aristocratic class, chose to live together. While the government has become more flexible about Na customs, some Na are now choosing to marry, especially when they work in the Chinese government or work away from their community. Young people's attitudes are also changing, largely because of their education in Chinese schools, where they become self-conscious when asked their fathers' names.7

In the nineteenth century, the Nayar, a subcaste in India, also lacked the custom of marriage.8 The Na and the Nayar may both have had frequently absent men. Nayar men hired themselves out to fight for princes in various parts of India. In the Na case, between the 1920s and the 1950s, the Na raised horses and mules for caravans they organized to transport merchandise throughout the western part of Yunnan. Of course, the relative absence of men cannot be the only reason for the absence of marriage in these groups; long-distance travel by men occurs in some other ethnic groups along with marriage.

#### Same-Sex Marriages

In addition to male-female marriages, some societies recognize same-sex marriages. Although they are far from common in any known society, same-sex marriages may be socially approved unions and entail reciprocal rights and obligations similar to those between heterosexual women and men. In some cultures, a biological female or male is expected to take on the opposite gender role and become the wife or husband in the union. Cheyenne Indians allowed a married man to take as a second wife a biological man who belonged to the third-gender "two-spirits."

It is not clear that Cheyenne male-male marriages involved homosexual relationships, but temporary homosexual marriages are known to have occurred among the Azande of Africa. Before the British took control over what is now Sudan, Azande warriors who could not afford wives often married "boy-wives." The boy-wives had sexual relations with their husbands and also performed many of the chores traditionally delegated to female wives. As in normal marriages, gifts (although less substantial) were given by the "husband" to the parents of his boy-wife. The husband performed services for the boy's parents and could sue any other lover of the boy in court for adultery.9

Female-female marriages are reported to have occurred in many African societies, but there is no evidence of sexual relationships between the partners. It seems, rather, that female-female marriages were a socially approved way for a woman to take on the legal and social roles of father and husband.10 Such marriages have existed, for example, among the Nandi, a pastoral and agricultural society of Kenya, as a way to resolve the failure to produce a male heir to property through a regular marriage. A woman, even if her husband is still alive, will become "husband" to a younger female and "father" the younger woman's future children. The female husband provides the marriage payments required for obtaining a wife, renounces female work, and takes on the obligations of husband. No sexual relations are permitted between the female husband and the new wife (or between the female husband and her own husband). Rather, the female husband arranges for her new wife to have a male consort in order to have children and subsequently becomes the socially designated father. If asked who their father is, children of such a marriage will name the female husband.11

# Why is Marriage Nearly Universal?

We said earlier that humans can survive and reproduce without marriage, but saying that does not mean that marriage isn't advantageous. In fact, because virtually all societies practice female-male marriage as we have defined it, we can assume that the custom is adaptive. But saying that does not specify exactly how it may be adaptive. Several interpretations have traditionally been offered to explain why all human societies have the custom of marriage. Each suggests that marriage solves problems found in all societies—how to share the products of a gender division of labor; how to care for infants, who are dependent for a long time; and how to minimize sexual competition. To evaluate the plausibility of these interpretations, we must ask whether marriage provides the best or the only reasonable solution to each problem. After all, we are trying to explain a custom that is virtually universal. The comparative study of other animals, some of which have something like marriage, may help us to evaluate these explanations.

#### Gender Division of Labor

Females and males in every society known to anthropology perform different economic activities. This gender division of labor has often been cited as a reason for marriage.12 As long as there is a division of labor by gender, society has to structure a way for women and men to share the products of their labor. Marriage would be one way to solve that problem. But it seems unlikely that marriage is the only possible solution. The hunter-gatherer rule of sharing could be extended to include all the products brought in by both women and men. Or a small group of men and women, such as brothers and sisters, might be pledged to cooperate economically. Thus, although marriage may solve the problem of sharing the fruits of a division of labor, it clearly is not the only possible solution.

19.2 Explain the nearuniversality of marriage across cultures.

## Prolonged Infant Dependency

Humans exhibit the longest period of infant dependency of any primate. The child's prolonged dependence places the greatest burden on the mother, who is the main child caregiver in most societies. The burden of prolonged child care by human females may limit the kinds of work they can do. They may need the help of a man to do certain types of work, such as hunting, that are incompatible with child care. Because of this prolonged dependency, it has been suggested, marriage is necessary.13 But here the argument becomes essentially the same as the division-of-labor argument, and it has the same logical weakness. It is not clear why a group of women and men, such as a hunter-gatherer band, could not cooperate in providing for dependent children without marriage.

## Sexual Competition

Unlike most other female primates, the human female may engage in intercourse at any time throughout the year. Some scholars have suggested that more or less continuous female sexuality may have created a serious problem: considerable sexual competition between males for females. It is argued that society had to prevent such competition to survive, that it had to develop some way of minimizing the rivalry among males for females to reduce the chance of lethal and destructive conflict.14

There are several problems with this argument. First, why should continuous female sexuality make for more sexual competition in the first place? One might argue the other way around. More availability should make for less competition. When there is only a brief breeding season, competition should be greater. Second, males of many animal species, even some in which females are frequently sexually receptive (such as many of our close primate relatives), do not show much aggression over females. Third, why couldn't sexual competition, even if it existed, be regulated by cultural rules other than marriage? For instance, society might have adopted a rule whereby men and women circulated among all the opposite-sex members of the group, each person staying a specified length of time with each partner. Such a system presumably would solve the problem of sexual competition. On the other hand, such a system might not work particularly well if individuals came to prefer certain other individuals. Jealousies attending those attachments might give rise to even more competition.

## A Look at Other Mammals and Birds

None of the theories we have discussed explains convincingly why marriage is the only or the best solution to a particular problem. In addition, some comparative evidence on mammals and birds casts doubt on those theories.15 How can evidence from other animals help us evaluate theories about human marriage? If we look at animals that, like humans, exhibit some stable

![](_page_4_Picture_8.jpeg)

female-male mating, as opposed to those that are completely promiscuous, we can perhaps see what factors may predict male-female bonding in the warm-blooded animal species. Female-male bonding occurs in most species of birds and some mammals, such as wolves and beavers. Among 40 mammal and bird species, neither division of labor, nor prolonged infant dependency, nor greater female sexuality correlates with male-female bonding in the direction predicted by the theories discussed earlier. The birds and mammals studied have nothing comparable to a humanlike division of labor, but they exhibit female-male unions nevertheless. The two other suggested factors prolonged infant dependency and female sexuality—relate to male-female bonding in the opposite direction to what was expected. Mammal and bird species that have longer infant dependency periods or more female sexuality are less likely to have male-female bonding.

Does any factor predict male-female bonding among other mammals and birds and thereby also help explain human marriage? It appears that animal species in which females are able to simultaneously feed themselves and

their babies after birth (*postpartum*) tend not to mate stably. On the other hand, species in which postpartum mothers cannot feed themselves and their babies at the same time do typically form male-female bonds. Among the typical bird species, a mother would have difficulty feeding herself and her babies simultaneously. Because her young cannot fly for some time, the mother risks losing them to predators if she leaves the nest untended to search for food. If a male has bonded with her, as males in most bird species do, he can bring food or take his turn watching the nest. Among animal species that have no postpartum feeding problem, babies are able to travel with the mother almost immediately after birth as she moves about to eat (as do such grazers as horses), or the mother can transport the babies as she moves about to eat (as do baboons and kangaroos). We believe the human female has a postpartum feeding problem. When humans lost most of their body hair, babies could not readily travel with the mother by clinging to her fur. And when humans began to depend on certain kinds of food-getting that could be dangerous, such as hunting, mothers could not safely engage in such work with their infants along.16

Research by Frank Marlowe on the Hadza foragers of Tanzania appears to support our view of female-male bonding. Hadza women and men both forage for food, with the women providing more berries and other plant foods while the men provide more meat and honey. Generally, it appears that Hadza women could support themselves and their children without a mate. Married women forage more regularly and contribute more food (in terms of calories) to the family diet, *except* when they have a nursing infant. Marlowe found that the father of an infant made up for the mother's lower food contribution while she was nursing. In fact, Hazda fathers with nursing children contributed significantly more food to the household than fathers with older children.17

Even if we assume that human mothers have a postpartum feeding problem, we must ask if marriage is the most likely solution to the problem. It may well be, because other conceivable solutions probably would not work as well. If a mother took turns babysitting with another mother, for example, neither might be able to collect enough food for both mothers and the two sets of children dependent on them. A mother and father share the same set of children, making it easier for them to feed themselves and their children adequately. Another possible solution is males and females living in a promiscuous group. We believe that a particular mother in that kind of arrangement would probably not be able to count on any male, if he didn't think he was the father, to watch her baby when she had to go out for food or to bring her food when she had to watch her baby. The need to solve the postpartum feeding problem by itself helps to explain why some animals, including humans, have relatively stable male-female bonds.18 Can research of this kind with other animals be applied to human beings? We believe it can, though not everybody will agree.

# How does One Marry?

When we say that marriage is a socially approved sexual and economic union, we mean that all societies have some way of marking the onset of a marriage, but the ways of doing so vary considerably. For reasons that we don't fully understand, some cultures mark marriages by elaborate rites and celebrations; others mark marriages in much more informal ways. And most societies have economic transactions before, during, or even after the onset of the marriages.

#### Marking the Onset of Marriage

Many societies mark the beginning of a marriage with a ceremony. Others, such as the Taramiut Inuit of the Arctic, the Trobriand Islanders, and the Kwoma of New Guinea, use different social signals to indicate that a marriage has taken place.

Among the Taramiut Inuit, an engaged couple's success at producing offspring marks the onset of marriage. The betrothal, or engagement, is considered extremely important and is arranged between the parents at or before the time their children reach puberty. Later, when the young man is ready, he moves in with his betrothed's family for a trial period. If all goes well—that is, if the young woman gives birth to a baby within a year or so—the couple is considered married and the wife goes with her husband to his camp. If the couple does not conceive, the young man returns to his family without a wife.19

19.3 Identify the various ways that marriage is marked out in different societies and the economic exchanges that accompany it.

In keeping with the general openness of their society's attitudes toward sexual matters, a Trobriand couple advertises its desire to marry "by sleeping together regularly, by showing themselves together in public, and by remaining with each other for long periods at a time."20 When a girl accepts a small gift from a boy, she demonstrates that her parents favor the match. Before long, she moves to the boy's house, takes her meals there, and accompanies her husband all day. Then the word goes around that the two are married.21

The Kwoma practice a trial marriage followed by a ceremony that makes the couple husband and wife. The girl lives for a while in the boy's home. When the boy's mother is satisfied with the match and knows that her son is too, she waits for a day when he is away from the house. Until that time, the girl has been cooking only for herself, and the boy's food has been prepared by his womenfolk. Now the mother has the girl prepare his meal. The young man returns and begins to eat his soup. When the first bowl is nearly finished, his mother tells him that his betrothed cooked the meal, and his eating it means that he is now married. At this news, the boy customarily rushes out of the house, spits out the soup, and shouts, "Faugh! It tastes bad! It is cooked terribly!" A ceremony then makes the marriage official.22

Just in the last three decades, "living together" has become more of an option in the United States and other Western countries. For most, living together is a prelude to marriage or kind of a trial marriage. For some, living together has become an alternative to marriage. Statistics in the United States suggest that by 1995 more than half of married women under the age of 45 had lived with a man without being married for at least some time period.23

Among those societies that have ceremonies marking the onset of marriage, feasting is a common public expression of the unification of the two families by marriage. A feast opens and ends the ceremony among the Reindeer Tungus of Siberia, for example. A wedding date is set after protracted negotiations between the two families and their larger kin groups. Go-betweens assume most of the responsibility for the negotiating. The wedding day opens with the two kin groups, probably numbering as many as 150 people, pitching their lodges in separate areas and offering a great feast. After the groom's gifts have been presented, the bride's dowry is loaded onto reindeer and carried to the groom's lodge. There, the climax of the ceremony takes place. The bride takes the wife's place—that is, at the right side of the entrance of the lodge—and members of both families sit in a circle. The groom enters and follows the bride around the circle, greeting each guest, while the guests, in their turn, kiss the bride on the mouth and hands. Finally, the go-betweens spit three times on the bride's hands, and the couple is formally husband and wife. More feasting and revelry bring the day to a close.24

In many cultures, marriage includes ceremonial expressions of hostility between the couples' families. Mock fights are staged or, in many societies, taunting and teasing take place. On occasion, such mock fights can have genuinely aggressive overtones, as among the Gusii of Kenya:

*Five young clansmen of the groom come to take the bride and two immediately find the girl and post themselves at her side to prevent her escape, while the others receive the final permission of her parents. When it has been granted the bride holds onto the house posts and must be dragged outside by the young men. Finally she goes along with them, crying and with her hands on her head.*<sup>25</sup>

But the battle is not yet over. Mutual antagonism continues right onto the marriage bed, even up to and beyond coitus. The groom is determined to display his virility; the bride is equally determined to test it. "Brides," Robert and Barbara LeVine remarked, "are said to take pride in the length of time they can hold off their mates." Men can also win acclaim. If the bride is unable to walk the following day, the groom is considered a "real man."26 Such expressions of hostility usually occur in societies in which the two sets of kin are actual or potential rivals or enemies. In many societies, it is common to marry women from "enemy" villages.

As the Gusii example suggests, marriage ceremonies often symbolize important elements of the culture. Whereas some ceremonies may symbolize hostility between the two families, others may promote harmony between the families. On the Polynesian island of Rotuma, for example, a female clown is an important part of the ceremony. She is responsible for creating an enjoyable, joking atmosphere that facilitates interaction between the two sides.27

#### **Economic Aspects of Marriage**

"It's not man that marries maid, but field marries field, vineyard marries vineyard, cattle marry cattle," goes a German peasant saying. In its down-to-earth way, the expression states a reality in many societies: Marriage involves economic considerations. In our culture, economic considerations may or may not be explicit. However, in about 75 percent of the societies known to anthropology,<sup>28</sup> one or more explicit economic transactions take place before or after the marriage. The economic transaction may include any of several forms: bride price, bride service, exchange of females, gift exchange, dowry, or indirect dowry. The distribution of those forms among societies that have economic marriage transactions is shown in Figure 19.1.

**Bride Price** A gift of money or goods from the groom or his kin to the bride's kin is known as **bride price** or **bride wealth**. The gift usually grants the groom the right to marry the bride and the right to her children. Of all the forms of economic transaction involved in marriage, bride price is the most common. In one cross-cultural sample, 44 percent of societies that had economic transactions at marriage practiced bride price; in almost all of those societies, the bride price was substantial.<sup>29</sup> Bride price is practiced all over the world, but it is especially common in Africa and Oceania. Payment may be made in different currencies; livestock and food are two of the more common. With the increased importance of commercial

exchange, money has increasingly become part of bride price payments. Among the Nandi, the bride price consists of five to seven cattle, one or two sheep and goats, cowrie shells, and money equivalent to the value of one cow. Even in unusual female-female marriages, the female "husband" must pay a bride price to arrange the marriage and be considered the "father."<sup>30</sup>

The Subanun of the Philippines exact a high bride price—several times the annual income of the groom plus three to five years of bride service (described in the next section).<sup>31</sup> Among the Manus of the Admiralty Islands of New Guinea, a groom requires an economic backer, usually an older brother or an uncle, if he is to marry, but it will be years before he can pay off his debts. Depending on the final bride price, payments may be concluded at the time of the marriage, or they may continue for years afterward.<sup>32</sup>

Despite the connotations that bride price may have, the practice does not reduce a woman to the position of slave. It is, nevertheless, associated with societies in which women have relatively low status. The bride price may be important to the woman and her family. Indeed, the fee they receive can serve as a security. If the marriage fails through no fault of hers and the wife returns to her kin, the family might not return the bride price to the groom. On the other hand, the wife's kin may pressure her to remain with her husband, even though she does not wish to, because they do not want to return the bride price or are unable to do so. A larger bride price is associated with more difficulty in obtaining a divorce.<sup>33</sup>

What kinds of societies are likely to have the custom of bride price? Cross-culturally, societies with bride price are likely to practice horticulture and lack social stratification. Bride price is also likely where women contribute a great deal to primary subsistence activities<sup>34</sup> and where they contribute more than men to all kinds of economic activities.<sup>35</sup> Although these findings might suggest that women are highly valued in such societies, recall that the status of women relative to men is not higher in societies in which women contribute a lot to primary subsistence activities. Indeed, bride price is likely to occur in societies in which men make most of the decisions in the household,<sup>36</sup> and decision making by men is one indicator of lower status for women.

**Bride Service** The next most common type of economic transaction at marriage occurring in about 19 percent of the societies with economic transactions—requires the groom to provide bride service, or work for the bride's family, sometimes before the

![](_page_7_Figure_9.jpeg)

Note that there are societies in the ethnographic record (25 percent) that lack any substantial economic transactions at marriage.

marriage begins, sometimes after. Bride service varies in duration. In some societies, it lasts for only a few months; in others, as long as several years. Among the North Alaskan Eskimo, for example, the boy works for his in-laws after the marriage is arranged. To fulfill his obligation, he may simply catch a seal for them. The marriage may be consummated at any time while he is in service.37 In some societies, bride service sometimes substitutes for bride price. An individual might give bride service to reduce the amount of bride price required. Native North and South American societies were likely to practice bride service, particularly if they were egalitarian food collectors.38

Exchange of Females Of the societies that have economic transactions at marriage, 6 percent have the custom whereby a sister or female relative of the groom is exchanged for the bride. Among the societies that practice exchange of females are the Tiv of West Africa and the Yanomamö of Venezuela and Brazil. These societies tend to be horticultural and egalitarian, and their women make a relatively high contribution to primary subsistence.39

Gift Exchange The exchange of gifts of about equal value by the two kin groups about to be linked by marriage occurs somewhat more often (about 11 percent of those with economic transactions) than the exchange of females.40 Among the Andaman Islanders, for example, as soon as a boy and girl indicate their intention to marry, their respective sets of parents cease all communication and begin sending gifts of food and other objects to each other through a third party. The gift exchange continues until the marriage is completed and the two kin groups are united.<sup>41</sup>

Dowry A substantial transfer of goods or money from the bride's family to the bride, 42 Unlike the types of transactions we have discussed so far, the dowry, which is given in about 8 percent of societies with economic transactions, is usually not a transaction between the kin of the bride and the kin of the groom. A family has to have wealth to give a dowry, but because the goods go to the new household, no wealth comes back to the family that gave the dowry. Payment of dowries was common in medieval and Renaissance Europe, where the size of the dowry often

determined the desirability of the daughter. The custom is still practiced in parts of eastern Europe and in sections of southern Italy and France, where land is often the major item the bride's family provides. Parts of India also practice the dowry.

In contrast to societies with bride price, societies with dowry tend to be those in which women contribute relatively little to primary subsistence activities, there is a high degree of social stratification, and a man is not allowed to be married to more than one woman simultaneously.43 Why does dowry tend to occur in these types of societies? One theory suggests that the dowry is intended to guarantee future support for a woman and her children, even though she will not do much primary subsistence work. Another theory is that the dowry is intended to attract the best bridegroom for a daughter in monogamous societies with a high degree of social inequality. The dowry strategy is presumed to increase the likelihood that the daughter and her children will do well reproductively. Both theories are supported by recent cross-cultural research, with the second predicting dowry better.44 But many stratified societies in which women and men have only one spouse at a time (including our own) do not practice dowry. Why this is so still needs to be explained.

Indirect Dowry The dowry is provided by the bride's family to the bride, the groom, or the couple. But sometimes the payments to the bride originate from the groom's family. Because the goods are sometimes first given to the bride's father, who passes most if not all of them to her, this kind of transaction is called **indirect dowry**. 45 Indirect dowry occurs in about 12 percent of the societies in which marriage involves an economic transaction. For example, among the Basseri of southern Iran, the groom's father assumes the expense of setting up the couple's new household. He gives cash to the bride's father, who uses at least some of the money to buy his daughter household utensils, blankets, and rugs.46

# Restrictions on Marriage: The Universal Incest Taboo

Romantic literature and Hollywood notwithstanding, marriage is seldom based solely on mutual love, independently discovered and expressed by the two life-partners-to-be. Nor is it based on sex or wealth alone. Even when love, sex, and economics are contributing factors, regulations specify whom one may or may not marry. Perhaps the most rigid regulation, found in *all* cultures, is the **incest taboo**, which prohibits sexual intercourse or marriage between some categories of kin.

The most universal aspect of the incest taboo is the prohibition of sexual intercourse or marriage between mother and son, father and daughter, and brother and sister. No society in recent times has permitted either sexual intercourse or marriage between those pairs. A few societies in the past, however, did permit incest, mostly within the royal and aristocratic families, though generally it was forbidden to the rest of the population. For example, the Incan and Hawaiian royal families allowed marriage within the family. Probably the best-known example of allowed incest involved Cleopatra of Egypt.

It seems clear that the Egyptian aristocracy and royalty indulged in father-daughter and brother-sister marriages. Cleopatra was married to two of her younger brothers at different times.47 The reasons seem to have been partly religious—a member of the family of the pharaoh, who was considered a god, could not marry any "ordinary" human—and partly economic, for marriage within the family kept the royal property undivided. Between 30 b.c. and a.d. 324, incest was allowed in ancient Egypt not only among the royal family but among commoners; an estimated 8 percent of commoner marriages were brother-sister marriages.48

In spite of such exceptions, no culture we know of today permits or accepts incest within the nuclear family. Why is the familial incest taboo universal? Several explanations have been suggested.

#### Childhood-Familiarity Theory

The childhood-familiarity theory, suggested by Edward Westermarck, was given a wide hearing in the early 1920s. Westermarck argued that people who have been closely associated with each other since earliest childhood, such as siblings, are not sexually attracted to each

other and would therefore avoid marriage with each other.49 This theory was rejected upon the subsequent discovery that some children were sexually interested in their parents and siblings. More recent studies have suggested, however, that there might be something to Westermarck's theory.

Yonina Talmon investigated marriage patterns among the second generation of three wellestablished collective communities (*kibbutzim*) in Israel. In these collectives, children live with many members of their peer group in quarters separate from their families. They are in constant interaction with their peers from birth to maturity. The study among 125 couples revealed that, despite parental encouragement of marriage within the peer group, there was "not one instance in which both mates were reared from birth in the same peer group."50 Children reared in common not only avoided marriage, they also avoided any sexual relations among themselves.

Talmon reported that the people reared together firmly believed that overfamiliarity breeds sexual disinterest. As one of them told her, "We are like an open book to each other. We have read the story in the book over and over again and know all about it."51 Talmon's evidence reveals not only the onset of disinterest and even sexual antipathy among children reared together but a correspondingly heightened fascination with newcomers or outsiders, particularly for their "mystery."

Arthur Wolf's study of the Chinese in northern Taiwan also supports the idea that something about being reared together produces sexual disinterest. Wolf focused on a community still practicing the Chinese custom of *t'ung-yang-hsi,* or "daughter-in-law raised from childhood":

*When a girl is born in a poor family . . . she is often given away or sold when but a few weeks or months old, or one or two years old, to be the future wife of a son in the family of a friend or relative which has a little son not betrothed in marriage. . . . The girl is called a "little bride" and taken home and brought up in the family together with her future husband.52*

Wolf's evidence indicates that this arrangement is associated with sexual difficulties when the childhood "couple" later marry. Informants implied that familiarity caused the couple to be disinterested and to fail to be stimulated by one another. Such couples produce fewer offspring than spouses who are not raised together, are more likely to seek extramarital sexual relationships, and are more likely to get divorced.53

The Talmon and Wolf findings are consistent with Westermarck's belief that the incest taboo may indicate avoidance more than it does a prohibition of certain matings. Another study, undertaken by Hilda and Seymour Parker, that may be consistent with Westermarck's explanation of the incest taboo compared two groups of fathers: those who had allegedly sexually abused their daughters and those who had not.54 To maximize the similarities among the men in their test group, the Parkers selected the fathers from the same prisons and psychiatric facilities. The Parkers found that the fathers who had committed incest with their daughters were much more likely to have had little involvement with bringing up their daughters; they were not at home or rarely at home during the daughters' first three years of life. The fathers who avoided incest had been more closely involved with their daughters' early childhood.

Although Westermarck's theory suggests that sexual aversion develops during early childhood, some researchers have asked whether the childhood familiarity theory could explain the extension of incest taboos to first cousins. The familiarity argument would imply that first-cousin marriage should be prohibited in societies where first cousins grow up in the same community. However, such societies are not more likely to prohibit first-cousin marriage.55

Even if it is likely that familiarity in childhood normally leads to sexual disinterest,56 we must ask why societies need to prohibit marriages that would voluntarily be avoided because of disinterest. And if familiarity breeds disinterest, what are we to make of couples who remain actively interested in each other sexually after years of marriage?

#### Freud's Psychoanalytic Theory

Sigmund Freud proposed that the incest taboo is a reaction against unconscious, unacceptable desires.57 He suggested that the son is attracted to his mother (as the daughter is to her father) and as a result feels jealousy and hostility toward his father. But the son knows that these feelings cannot continue, for they might lead the father to retaliate against him; therefore, they must be renounced or repressed. Usually the unacceptable feelings are repressed and retreat into the unconscious. But the desire to possess the mother continues to exist in the unconscious, and, according to Freud, horror at the thought of incest is a reaction to, or a defense against, the forbidden unconscious impulse.

Freud's theory may account for the aversion felt toward incest, or at least the aversion toward parent-child incest, but it, too, does not explain why society needs an explicit taboo, particularly on brother-sister incest. Nor does it account for the findings that support Westermarck's hypothesis that familiarity breeds sexual disinterest.

### Family-Disruption Theory

The family-disruption theory, often associated with Bronislaw Malinowski,58 can best be summed up as follows: Sexual competition among family members would create so much rivalry and tension that the family could not function as an effective unit. Because the family must function effectively for society to survive, society has to curtail competition within the family. The familial incest taboo is thus imposed to keep the family intact.

But while this theory might explain why father-daughter and mother-son incest would need to be prohibited, why couldn't societies have a rule that brothers and sisters could marry when they were adults? Hypothetically, brother-sister incest would not disrupt the authority of the parents if the children were allowed to marry when mature. And brothersister marriages did exist in ancient Egypt. The family-disruption theory, then, does not explain the origin of the incest taboo.

### Cooperation Theory

The cooperation theory was proposed by the early anthropologist Edward B. Tylor and further elaborated by Leslie A. White and Claude Lévi-Strauss. It emphasizes the value of the incest taboo in promoting cooperation among family groups and thus helping communities to survive. As Tylor saw it, certain operations necessary for the welfare of the community can be accomplished only by large numbers of people working together. To break down suspicion and hostility between family groups and make such cooperation possible, early humans developed the incest taboo to ensure that individuals would marry members of other families. The ties created by intermarriage would serve to hold the community together. Thus, Tylor explained the incest taboo as an answer to the choice "between marrying out and being killed out."59

The idea that marriage with other groups promotes cooperation sounds plausible, but is there evidence to support it? There are, of course, societies such as the Gusii in which

marriage is often between hostile groups. But is that society an exception? And does marriage itself promote cooperation? Because people in all recent societies marry outside the family, we cannot test the idea that such marriages promote cooperation more than marriages within the family. We can ask whether other kinds of out-marriage, such as marriage with other communities, promote cooperation with those communities. The evidence suggests not. There is no greater peacefulness between communities when marriages are forbidden within the community and arranged with other communities than when they are not.<sup>60</sup>

Even if marriage outside the family promoted cooperation with other groups, why would it be necessary to prohibit all marriages within the family? Couldn't families have required some of their members to marry outside the family if they thought it necessary for survival, but permitted incestuous marriages when such alliances were not needed? Although the incest taboo might enhance cooperation between families, other customs can also promote alliances. The need for cooperation does not adequately explain why the incest taboo exists in all societies. In particular, the cooperation theory does not explain the sexual aspect of the incest taboo. Premarital and extramarital sex is common and tolerated in many societies. Incestuous sex could likewise theoretically be allowed, as long as children were required to marry outside the family.

#### Inbreeding Theory

One of the oldest explanations for the incest taboo is inbreeding theory. It focuses on the potentially damaging consequences of inbreeding or marrying within the family. People within the same family are likely to carry the same harmful recessive genes. Inbreeding, then, will tend to produce offspring who are more likely to die early of genetic disorders than are the offspring of unrelated spouses. Recent evidence suggests that inbreeding also tends to increase the likelihood of diseases that affect people later in life, such as heart disease and diabetes.61 For many years, inbreeding theory was rejected because of what is known from dog-breeding, in which, for example, a half-brother and half-sister might be bred (line breeding) or brothers and sisters might be bred (inbreeding). The inbreeding practiced to produce prize-winning dogs, however, is not a good guide to whether inbreeding is harmful; dog breeders have not counted the runts they cull at the expense of producing one superficially show-worthy dog. Nor have they needed to worry about the genetic ailments a dog may eventually display. Indeed, dog-breeders as well as mating humans now have a good deal of evidence that the closer the degree of inbreeding, the more harmful the genetic effects.62

Genetic mutations occur frequently. Although many pose no harm to the individuals who carry a single recessive gene, matings between two people who carry the same gene often produce offspring with a harmful or lethal condition. Close blood relatives are much more likely than unrelated individuals to carry the same harmful recessive gene. If close relatives mate, their offspring have a higher probability than the offspring of nonrelatives of inheriting the harmful trait.

One study compared children produced by familial incest with children of the same mothers produced by nonincestuous unions. About 40 percent of the incestuously produced children had serious abnormalities, compared with about 5 percent of the other children.63 Matings between less closely related kin also show harmful, though not as harmful, effects of inbreeding. The likelihood that a child will inherit a double dose of a harmful recessive gene is lower the more distantly the child's parents are related. Also consistent with inbreeding theory is the fact that rates of abnormality are consistently higher in the offspring of uncle-niece marriages (which are allowed in some societies) than in the offspring of cousin marriages; for the offspring of uncle-niece marriages, the likelihood of inheriting a double dose of a harmful recessive is twice that for the offspring of first cousins.64

Although most scholars acknowledge the harmful effects of inbreeding, some question whether people in former days would deliberately have invented or borrowed the incest taboo because they knew that inbreeding was biologically harmful. William Durham's cross-cultural survey suggests that they did. Ethnographers do not always report the perceived consequences of incest, but Durham found that biological harm to offspring

was mentioned in 50 percent of ethnographic reports.65 For example, Raymond Firth reporting on the Tikopia, who live on an island in the South Pacific, wrote:

*The idea is firmly held that unions of close kin bear with them their own doom, their* mara*. . . . The idea* [mara] *essentially concerns barrenness. . . . The peculiar barrenness of an incestuous union consists not in the absence of children, but in their illness or death, or some other mishap. . . . The idea that the offspring of a marriage between near kin are weakly and likely to die young is stoutly held by these natives and examples are adduced to prove it.*<sup>66</sup>

Durham concluded that if the harm of inbreeding was widely recognized, people may have deliberately invented or borrowed the incest taboo.67 But whether or not people actually recognized the harmfulness of inbreeding, the demographic consequences of the incest taboo would account for its universality: Reproductive and hence competitive advantages probably accrued to groups practicing the taboo. Thus, even though cultural solutions other than the incest taboo might provide the desired effects assumed by the family-disruption theory and the cooperation theory, the incest taboo is the only possible solution to the problem of inbreeding.

As is discussed toward the end of the next section, a society may or may not extend the incest taboo to first cousins. That variation is also predictable from inbreeding theory, a fact that lends additional support to the idea that the incest taboo was invented or borrowed to avoid the harmful consequences of inbreeding.

# Whom should One Marry?

Probably every child in our society knows the story of Cinderella—the poor, downtrodden, but lovely girl who accidentally meets, falls in love with, and marries a prince. It is a charming tale, but it is misleading as a guide to mate choice. The majority of marriages simply do not occur in so free and coincidental a way in any society. In addition to the familial incest taboo, societies often have other rules regarding the mate, such as whether they may or not be cousins, whether they should or should not come from the same community, and even whether the couple has choice in the matter.

Even in a post-industrial, urbanized society such as ours, where mate choice is theoretically free, people tend to marry within their own class and geographic area. Studies in the United States consistently indicate that a person is likely to marry someone who lives close by.68 Because we tend to live in neighborhoods with people from similar class backgrounds, it is unlikely that many of these alliances are Cinderella stories. Moreover, it is worth remembering that even Cinderella's story stretches convention only so far. She was, after all, a well-born girl who just happened to be oppressed by her evil stepmother and stepsisters—until, that is, the prince discovers that only Cinderella's *aristocratically* dainty foot will fit in the glass slipper. Parental preferences are not just found in complex societies. Even in societies with subsistence economies, parents prefer their children marry someone of a "good family background."69

#### Arranged Marriages

Parents invariably play a role in who their offspring marry. In many societies, parents or other family members determine who their sons and daughters will marry, with the respective families or go-betweens handling the negotiations. Sometimes betrothals are completed while the future partners are still children, as was formerly the custom in much of Hindu India, China, Japan, and eastern and southern Europe. Implicit in the arranged marriage is the conviction that the joining together of two different kin groups to form new social and economic ties is too important to be left to free choice and romantic love.

In some societies, arranged marriages were more likely to take place among the elite or royal families; commoners or poorer people could make their own choices. King Solomon, according to biblical texts, married the daughter of the Egyptian pharaoh, his old enemy. In order to protect his growing empire, Alexander the Great married the daughter of the Persian king Darius III. Beginning with the 12th-century rule of the first

19.5 Discuss the types of restrictions on whom one can marry.

English king, Henry I, until the late-20th-century marriage of Prince Charles and Lady Diana, the British monarchy arranged the unions of heirs to the throne.

Even in modern Western societies, where people assume that they choose their mates freely, parents' choices were shown to influence who their sons and daughters married well into the mid-20th century.70 Given the freedom to choose, do people today pick someone very different from the spouse their parents might have selected for them? Perhaps not. One experiment showed that, whether selecting a husband or wife for their offspring or for themselves, people placed three key traits at the top of a list of 18: emotional stability, a dependable character, and a pleasing disposition. It seems that secondary traits, such as good looks, mattered more if someone were choosing a mate for him or herself.71

Good looks appear to matter less when an arranged marriage is also a class alliance, as among the Kwakiutl of British Columbia.

*When I was old enough to get a wife—I was about 25—my brothers looked for a girl in the same position that I and my brothers had. Without my consent, they picked a wife for me— Lagius'[s] daughter. The one I wanted was prettier than the one they chose for me, but she was in a lower position than me, so they wouldn't let me marry her.*<sup>72</sup>

Arranged marriages are becoming less common in many places, and couples are beginning to have more a voice in selecting their marriage partners. Marriages were still arranged, for example, on the Pacific island of Rotuma in 1960, and the bride and groom would sometimes not meet until the wedding day. A Rotuma wedding ceremony may be much the same today as it was then, but couples are now allowed to "go out" and have a say about whom they wish to marry.73 In a small Moroccan town, arranged marriages are still the norm, although a young man may ask his mother to make a marriage offer to a particular girl's parents, who may then ask her whether she wants to accept the marriage offer. But dating is still not acceptable, so getting acquainted is hard to arrange.74

#### Exogamy and Endogamy

A widespread marriage practice is the regulation of whether a partner comes from outside or inside one's own kin group or community. The rule of **exogamy** requires that the marriage partner come from outside one's own kin group or community. Exogamy can take many forms. It may mean marrying outside a particular group of kin or outside a particular village or group of villages. Often, then, spouses come from a distance. For example, in Rani Khera, a village in India, 266 married women originally came from some 200 different villages that were, on average, between 12 and 24 miles away. Meanwhile, 220 local women had gone to 200 other villages to marry. As a result of these exogamous marriages, Rani Khera, a village of 150 households, was linked to 400 other nearby villages.75 When there are rules of exogamy, violations are often believed to cause harm. On the islands of Yap in Micronesia, people who are related through women are referred to as "people of one belly." The elders say that if two people from the same kinship group married, they would not have any female children and the group would die out.76

People in exogamous societies with very low population densities often have to travel considerable distances to meet mates. A study of foragers and horticulturalists found a clear relationship between population density and the distance between the communities of the husband and wife—the lower the density, the greater the marriage distance. Because forager societies generally have lower population densities than horticulturalists, they generally have further to go to find mates. Among the !Kung, for instance, the average husband and wife had lived 40 miles (65 kilometers) from each other before they were married.77

The opposite rule, **endogamy**, obliges a person to marry within a particular group. The caste groups of India traditionally have been endogamous. The higher castes believed that marriage with lower castes would "pollute" them, and such unions were forbidden. Caste endogamy is also found in some parts of Africa. In East Africa, a Masai warrior would never stoop to marry the daughter of an ironworker, nor would a former ruling-caste Tutsi in Rwanda, in central Africa, think of marrying a person from the hunting caste Twa.

# **Migrants and Immigrants**

#### Arranging Marriages in the Diaspora

hat happens when people move from a place with arranged marriage to a place where marriage is based on free choice and romantic love? Many people around the world or their parents are from places that reject love marriage because it could fizzle out. Love was not considered a sufficient basis for marriage. So parents and other kin, or hired go-betweens, would select your marriage partner, preferably someone from the same socioeconomic background. For example, in many parts of South Asia, one was supposed to marry someone from the same caste and class until recently. Many immigrant parents still insist that their children's marriages be arranged. But this is changing. Consider how some young South Asians in England are "arranging" their own marriages.

Go-betweens are replaced by Web sites, chat rooms, and personal advertisements on the Internet. A couple who "meet" first electronically might arrange a face-to-face meeting, in what's called "South Asian speed dating"; they agree to meet and talk for just three minutes—at a restaurant or bar, and then they move on. The participants, who are in their 20s and middle class, consider themselves hip. They are quite comfortable blending behaviors from West and East. Is the same true for South Asians in the United States?

But at the age of 27, she decided to marry someone like herself. Because she was focused on her career and didn't have time to date, her mother enlisted the help of a Sikh matchmaker who had been instructed by the mother of a man named Ranjeet to find a wife for him. Ranjeet also had thought he would marry for love. "But seeing how different cultures treated their families, I realized the importance of making

the right match," he said. When the matchmaker organized a party to which she invited Rakhi and Ranjeet (and their mothers), Rakhi's mother whispered: "I think he's the one." After the two young people dated secretly for two months, the matchmaker was once again summoned, this time to negotiate the marital arrangements. Some time later, Rakhi and Ranjeet were married in a Sikh temple in a New York suburb.

### **Cousin Marriages**

When referring to their cousins, people in the United States generally do not differentiate between types of cousins. In some other societies, such distinctions can be important, particularly with regard to first cousins. The terms for the different kinds of first cousins may indicate which cousins are suitable marriage partners (sometimes even preferred mates) and which are not. Although most societies prohibit marriage with all types of first cousins,  $\sqrt{8}$ some societies allow and even prefer particular kinds of cousin marriage.

When first-cousin marriage is allowed or preferred, it is usually with some kind of crosscousin. Cross-cousins are children of siblings of the opposite sex; that is, a person's crosscousins are the father's sisters' children and the mother's brothers' children. The Chippewa Indians used to practice cross-cousin marriage, as well as cross-cousin joking. With his female cross-cousins, a Chippewa man was expected to exchange broad, risqué jokes, but he would not do so with his parallel cousins, with whom severe propriety was the rule.

Cross-cousins Children of siblings of the opposite sex. One's cross-cousins are the father's sisters' children and mother's brothers' children.

#### **Parallel cousins** Children of siblings of the same sex. One's parallel cousins are the father's brothers' children and the mother's sisters' children.

#### **Levirate** A custom whereby a man is obliged to marry his deceased brother's wife.

#### **Sororate** A custom whereby a woman is obliged to marry her deceased sister's husband.

**Monogamy** Marriage between only one man and only one woman at a time.

**Polygamy** Plural marriage; one individual is married to more than one spouse simultaneously. Polygyny and polyandry are types of polygamy.

**Polygyny** The marriage of one man to more than one woman at a time.

**Polyandry** The marriage of one woman to more than one man at a time.

19.6 Describe the three different rules regarding how many persons one can marry, and explain social or economic reasons for each.

**Parallel cousins** are children of siblings of the same sex; a person's parallel cousins, then, are the father's brothers' children and the mother's sisters' children. In general, in any society that allows cross-cousin but not parallel-cousin marriage, a joking relationship exists between a man and his female cross-cousins. In marked contrast, the man will maintain a formal and respectful relationship with female parallel cousins. The joking relationship apparently signifies the possibility of marriage, whereas the respectful relationship extends the incest taboo to parallel cousins.

Parallel-cousin marriage is fairly rare, but some Muslim societies have historically preferred such marriages and allowed other cousin marriages as well. The Kurds, who are mostly Sunni Muslims, preferred that a young man marry his father's brother's daughter (for her part, the young woman would be marrying her father's brother's son). The woman will stay close to home in such a marriage, since her father and his brother usually live near each other. Because the bride and groom are also in the same kin group, marriage in this case also entails kin group endogamy.79

What kinds of societies allow or prefer first-cousin marriage? There is evidence from cross-cultural research that cousin marriages are most likely to be permitted in relatively large and densely populated societies. Perhaps this is because such marriages, and thus the risks of inbreeding, are less likely in large populations. However, a number of small, sparsely populated societies also permit or even prefer cousin marriage. How can these cases be explained? It appears that most of the small societies that permit cousin marriage have lost a lot of people to epidemics. For example, many societies around the world, particularly in the Pacific and in North and South America, suffered severe depopulation in the first generation or two after contact with Europeans, who introduced diseases (including measles, pneumonia, and smallpox) to which the native populations had little or no resistance. Such societies may have permitted cousin marriage to provide enough mating possibilities within a reduced population of eligible mates.80

#### Levirate and Sororate

Cultural rules that oblige individuals to marry the spouse of a deceased relative are exceedingly common and have been an obligatory form of second marriage in a majority of the societies known to anthropology.<sup>81</sup> **Levirate** is a custom whereby a man is obliged to marry his deceased brother's wife. **Sororate** obliges a woman to marry her deceased sister's husband.

Among the Chukchee of Siberia, levirate obliges the next oldest brother to become the successor husband to his brother's widow. He cares for her and the children, assumes the sexual privileges of the husband, and unites the deceased's reindeer herd with his own, though he keeps ownership of the herd in the name of his brother's children. If there are no brothers, the widow is married to a cousin of her first husband. The custom is regarded more as a duty than a right.<sup>82</sup>

# How Many does One Marry?

Today, in most Western societies, **monogamy**, not only is the form of marriage in which one has only one spouse at a time (usually one man and one woman) customary, but plural marriage is illegal. However, cross-culturally, most societies known to anthropology have allowed some form of **polygamy**, or plural spouse marriage. There are two types of polygamy. **Polygyny**, the form of marriage that allows a man to be married to more than one woman at the same time, is very common. The mirror image of polygyny, the marriage of one woman to more than one man at the same time, is called **polyandry**. It is practiced in just a few societies. However, societies with polygamy cannot practice it exclusively because few, if any, societies have twice as many of one gender than the other. So in a polygynous society, for example, most men will be married monogamously at any given time. *Group marriage*, in which more than one man is married to more than one woman at the same time, sometimes occurs but is not customary in any known society.

### Polygyny

Although polygyny is now illegal in most Western societies, it was very much a part of Judeo-Christian history and appeared to be a privilege of rulers and elites. The Old Testament includes many references to men with multiple wives. King David and his son, King Solomon, are both said to have had hundreds of wives and concubines, though such extravagant numbers are likely to be exaggerated. In early Medieval Europe, rulers practiced polygyny to ensure that they would have a male heir. And rulers took more than one wife as a way to build alliances with or annex neighboring kingdoms. Polygyny continues to be a mark of great wealth or high status in many societies, but in those societies only the very wealthy are expected to (or can) support more than one wife. Some Muslim societies, especially Arabic-speaking ones, still view polygyny in this light. But a man does not always have to be wealthy to be polygynous; indeed, in some societies in which women are important contributors to the economy, it seems that men try to have more than one wife to become wealthier.

Among the Siwai, a society in the South Pacific, status is achieved through feast giving. Pork is the main dish at these feasts, so the Siwai associate raising pigs with prestige. The great interest in pigs also sparks an interest in wives, because in Siwai society women raise the food needed to feed pigs. Thus, although having many wives does not in itself confer status among the Siwai, the increase in pig herds—and prestige—that can result offers men a strong incentive to be polygynous.83 Polygynously married Siwai men do seem to have greater prestige, but they also complain that a household with multiple wives is difficult. Sinu, a Siwai, described his plight:

*There is never peace for a long time in a polygynous family. If the husband sleeps in the house of one wife, the other one sulks all the next day. If the man is so stupid as to sleep two consecutive nights in the house of one wife, the other one will refuse to cook for him, saying, "So-and-so is your wife; go to her for food. Since I am not good enough for you to sleep with, then my food is not good enough for you to eat." Frequently the co-wives will quarrel and fight. My uncle formerly had five wives at one time and the youngest one was always raging and fighting the others. Once she knocked an older wife senseless and then ran away and had to be forcibly returned.*<sup>84</sup>

Sororal and Nonsoral Polygyny Jealousy and conflict between co-wives seem not to be present in a minority of polygynous societies. Margaret Mead reported that married life among the Arapesh of New Guinea, even in polygynous marriages, was "so even and contented that there is nothing to relate of it at all."85 What might explain such harmony? One possible explanation is that the co-wives are sisters. **Sororal polygyny**, a man's marriage to two or more sisters, seems to work because siblings, having grown up together, are more likely to get along and cooperate than co-wives who practice **nonsororal polygyny**—that is, who are not related. Indeed, a recent cross-cultural study confirms that persistent conflict and resentment were all-too-common in societies with nonsororal polygyny. The most commonly reported complaint was insufficient access to the husband for sex and emotional support.86

Perhaps because conflict is so common among co-wives, particularly with nonsororal polygyny, polygynous societies appear to have invented similar customs to try to lessen conflict and jealousy in co-wives:

- 1. Whereas sororal co-wives nearly always live under the same roof, co-wives who are not sisters tend to have separate living quarters. Among the African Plateau Tonga, who practice nonsororal polygyny, co-wives live in separate dwellings and the husband shares his personal goods and his favors among his wives according to principles of strict equality. The Crow of the northern plains of North America, on the other hand, practiced sororal polygyny; their co-wives usually shared a tepee.
- 2. Co-wives have clearly defined equal rights in matters of sex, economics, and personal possessions. For example, the Tanala of Madagascar require the husband to spend a day with each co-wife in succession. Failure to do so constitutes adultery and entitles the slighted wife to sue for divorce and alimony of up to one-third of the husband's

property. Furthermore, the land is shared equally among all the women, who expect the husband to help with its cultivation when he visits them.

3. Senior wives often have special prestige. The Tonga of Polynesia, for example, bestow the status of "chief wife" upon the first wife. Her house stands to the right of her husband's and is named the "house of the father." The other wives are called "small wives," and their houses are to the left of the husband's. The chief wife has the right to be consulted first, before the small wives, and her husband is expected to sleep under her roof before and after a journey. Because later wives are often favored because they tend to be younger and therefore more attractive, practices that elevate the first wife's status may serve as compensation for her loss of physical attractiveness by increased prestige.87

Why Is Polygyny a Common Practice? Although jealousy and conflict are noted as common problems in polygynous marriage, the practice may also offer social benefits. Married females as well as males in Kenya believed that polygyny provided economic and political advantages, according to a study conducted by Philip and Janet Kilbride. Because they tend to be large, polygynous families provide plenty of farm labor and extra food that can be marketed. They also tend to be influential in their communities and are likely to produce individuals who become government officials.88 And in South Africa, Connie Anderson found that women choose to be married to a man with other wives because the other wives could help with child care and household work, provide companionship, and allow more freedom to come and go. Some women said they chose polygynous marriages because there was a shortage of marriageable males.89

How can we account for the fact that polygyny is allowed and often preferred in most of the societies known to anthropology? Ralph Linton suggested that polygyny derives from a general male primate urge to collect females.90 But if that were so, then why wouldn't all societies allow polygyny? Other explanations of polygyny have been suggested. We restrict our discussion here to those that statistically and strongly predict polygyny in worldwide samples of societies.

One theory is that polygyny will be permitted in societies that have a long **postpartum sex taboo**. 91 In these societies, a couple must abstain from intercourse until their child is at least a year old. John Whiting suggested that couples abstain from sexual intercourse for a long time after their child is born for health reasons. A Hausa woman reported:

*A mother should not go to her husband while she has a child she is suckling. If she does, the child gets thin; he dries up, he won't be strong, he won't be healthy. If she goes after two years it is nothing, he is already strong before that, it does not matter if she conceives again after two years.*<sup>92</sup>

The symptoms the woman described seem to be those of *kwashiorkor.* Common in tropical areas, kwashiorkor is a protein-deficiency disease that occurs particularly in children suffering from intestinal parasites or diarrhea. If a child gets protein from mother's milk during its first few years, the likelihood of contracting kwashiorkor may be greatly reduced. By observing a long postpartum sex taboo, and thereby ensuring that her children are widely spaced, a woman can nurse each child longer. Consistent with Whiting's interpretation, societies whose principal foods are low-protein staples, such as taro, sweet potatoes, bananas, breadfruit, and other root and tree crops, tend to have a long postpartum sex taboo. Societies with long postpartum sex taboos also tend to be polygynous. Perhaps, then, a man's having more than one wife is a cultural adjustment to the taboo. As a Yoruba woman said,

*When we abstain from having sexual intercourse with our husband for the two years we nurse our babies, we know he will seek some other woman. We would rather have her under our control as a co-wife so he is not spending money outside the family.*<sup>93</sup>

Even if we agree that men will seek other sexual relationships during the period of a long postpartum sex taboo, it is not clear why polygyny is the only possible solution to the problem. After all, it is conceivable that all of a man's wives might be subject to the postpartum sex taboo at the same time. Furthermore, there may be sexual outlets outside marriage.

#### Love, Intimacy, and Sexual Jealousy in Marriage

mericans believe that love should be a basis of marriage. Does this ideal characterize most societies? We know the answer to that question: No. In fact, in many places, romantic love is believed to be a poor basis for marriage and is strongly discouraged. However, even though romantic love may not be a basis for marriage everywhere, it does occur almost everywhere. A cross-cultural survey suggests that about 89 percent of the world's societies show signs of romantic love—accounts of personal longing, love songs or love depicted in folklore, elopement because of affection, and passionate love that is described by informants and quoted in ethnographies. If love is nearly universal, then why is it often discouraged as a basis for marriage?

Three conditions appear to predict that a society will discourage romantic love in marriage. One is that the husband and wife live in an extended family. In this situation, the family seems more concerned with how the in-marrying person gets along with others and less concerned with whether the husband and wife love each other. A second condition predicting the discouragement of romantic love as a basis for marriage is that one of the spouses does most of the primary subsistence work or earns most of the couple's income. Third, romantic love is unlikely when men have more sexual freedom than women. In general, then, romantic love is discouraged as a basis for marriage under conditions of inequality—if one of the spouses is highly dependent on the other or the other's kin or the woman has fewer sexual rights than the man.

Intimacy is different from romantic love. It refers to how close the married

couple are to each other—eating together, sleeping in the same bed, spending their leisure time together, as well as having frequent sex. In some societies, couples are together a lot; in others, they spend very little time together. Foraging societies seem on average to have more marital intimacy than more complex herding and agricultural societies, but the reasons are not entirely clear. Also, a high involvement in war seems to detract from intimacy.

When it comes to sexual jealousy, men are far more likely to be violent than women. Infidelity is, incidentally, the most frequently reported reason for a husband to divorce a wife. According to anthropologists with a biological orientation, fathers always have some uncertainty about whether their children are theirs; for that reason alone males are more likely to try to guard against rival males.

But how can we account for the considerable variation in jealousy from one society to another? It does seem that the more a society emphasizes the importance of getting married, the more it limits sex to the marriage relationship, the more it also emphasizes property, the more its males appear to exhibit sexual jealousy.

Does romantic love as a basis for marriage increase or decrease sexual jealousy? Does romantic love predict intimacy, or is romantic love more likely with less frequent contact between the spouses? We are still far from understanding how the different aspects of marriage are related. All we know is that an emphasis on love and intimacy does not preclude marital violence or marital dissolution.

Another explanation of polygyny is that it is a response to an excess of women over men. Such an imbalanced sex ratio may occur because of the prevalence of warfare in a society. Because men and not women are generally the warriors, warfare almost always takes a greater toll of men's lives. Given that almost all adults in noncommercial societies are married, polygyny may be a way of providing spouses for surplus women. Indeed, there is evidence that societies with imbalanced sex ratios in favor of women tend to have both polygyny and high male mortality in warfare. Conversely, societies with balanced sex ratios tend to have both monogamy and low male mortality in warfare.<sup>94</sup>

![](_page_20_Picture_1.jpeg)

Even though illegal, many in the state of Utah still practice polygyny. The husband in the top row of this picture has five wives and 35 children.

A third explanation is that a society will allow polygyny when men marry at an older age than women. The argument is similar to the sex-ratio interpretation. Delaying the age when men marry would create an artificial, though not an actual, excess of marriageable women. Why marriage for men is delayed is not clear, but the delay does predict polygyny.95

Is one of these explanations better than the others, or are all three factors—long postpartum sex taboo, imbalanced sex ratio in favor of women, and delayed age of marriage for men—important in explaining polygyny? One way of trying to decide among alternative explanations is to do what is called a *statistical-control analysis,* which allows us to see if a particular factor still predicts when the effects of other possible factors are removed. In this case, when the possible effect of sex ratio is removed, a long postpartum sex taboo no longer predicts polygyny and hence is probably not a cause of polygyny.96 But both an actual excess of women and a late age of marriage for men seem to be strong predictors of polygyny. Added together, these two factors predict polygyny even more strongly.97

Behavioral ecologists have also suggested ecological reasons why both men and women might prefer polygynous marriages. If there are enough resources, men might prefer polygyny because they can have more children if they have more than one wife. If resources are highly variable and men control resources, women might find it advantageous to marry a man with many resources even if she is a second wife. A recent study of foragers suggests that foraging societies in which men control hunting or fishing territories are more likely to be polygynous. This finding is consistent with the theory, but the authors were surprised that control of gathering sites by men did not predict polygyny.98 The main problem with the theory of variable resources and their marital consequences is that many societies, particularly in the "modern" world, have great variability in wealth but little polygyny. Behavioral ecologists have had to argue, therefore, that polygyny is lacking because of socially imposed constraints. But why are those constraints imposed?

The sex-ratio interpretation can explain the absence of polygyny in most commercialized modern societies. Very complex societies have standing armies, and in such societies male mortality in warfare is rarely as high *proportionately* as in simpler societies. Also, with commercialization, there are more possibilities for individuals to support themselves in commercialized societies without being married. The degree of disease in the environment may also be a factor.

Bobbi Low has suggested that a high incidence of disease may reduce the prevalence of "healthy" men. In such cases, it may be to a woman's advantage to marry a healthy man even if he is already married, and it may be to a man's advantage to marry several unrelated women to maximize genetic variation (and disease resistance) among his children. Indeed, societies with many pathogens are more likely to have polygyny.99 A recent cross-cultural study compared the degree of disease as an explanation of polygyny with the imbalanced sex-ratio explanation. Both were supported. The number of pathogens predicted particularly well in more densely populated complex societies, where pathogen load is presumably greater. The sex-ratio explanation predicted polygyny particularly well in sparser, nonstate societies.100 Nigel Barber used data from modern nations to test these ideas. He found that sex-ratio and pathogen stress predicted polygyny in modern nations as well.101

#### Polyandry

George Peter Murdock's "World Ethnographic Sample" included only four societies (less than 1 percent of the total) in which polyandry, or the marriage of several men to one woman, was practiced.102 When the husbands are brothers we call it **fraternal polyandry**; if they are not brothers, it is **nonfraternal polyandry**. Some Tibetans, the Toda of India, and the Sinhalese of Sri Lanka have practiced fraternal polyandry. Among some Tibetans who practice fraternal polyandry, biological paternity seems to be of no particular concern; there is no attempt to link children biologically to a particular brother, and all children are treated the same.103

One possible explanation for the practice of polyandry is a shortage of women. The Toda practiced female infanticide;104 the Sinhalese had a shortage of women but denied the practice of female infanticide.105 A correlation between shortage of women and polyandry would account for why polyandry is so rare in the ethnographic record; an excess of men is rare cross-culturally.

Another possible explanation is that polyandry is an adaptive response to severely limited resources. Melvyn Goldstein studied Tibetans who live in the northwestern corner of Nepal, above 12,000 feet in elevation. Cultivable land is extremely scarce there, with most families having less than an acre. The people say they practice fraternal polyandry to prevent the division of a family's farm and animals. Instead of dividing up their land among them and each taking a wife, brothers preserve the family farm by sharing a wife. Although not recognized by the Tibetans, their practice of polyandry minimizes population growth. There are as many women as men of marriageable age. But about 30 percent of the women do not marry, and although these women do have some children, they have far fewer than married women. Thus, the practice of polyandry minimizes the number of mouths to feed and therefore maximizes the standard of living of the polyandrous family. In contrast, if the Tibetans practiced monogamy and almost all women married, the birth rate would be much higher and there would be more mouths to feed with the severely limited resources.<sup>106</sup>

Polyandry is still customary in some Tibetan communities, although monogamous marriages actually outnumber polyandrous marriages. This is because a set of brothers may start off being married to one woman, but younger brothers may later opt to marry separately and form their own households. Also, some households have only one son or daughter and polyandrous marriages are not possible. Family wealth increases the likelihood of a young brother leaving, but this mostly happens when the polyandrous household lacks agricultural fields, herds, and opportunities for trade.107 In polygynous societies, monogamous marriages also outnumber polygynous marriages at any given time. But the reasons are different. Most polygynous societies practice nonsororal marriages, and when a man first marries, he is married monogamously. Because significant resources are needed to marry again (a bride price is common), subsequent marriages occur later in life.

# The Family

Family form varies from one society to another and even within societies, but all societies have families. A **family** is a social and economic unit consisting minimally of one or more parents (or parent substitutes) and their children. Members of a family have certain reciprocal rights and obligations, particularly economic ones. Family members usually live in one household, but common residence is not a defining feature of families. In our society, **Fraternal polyandry** The marriage of a woman to two or more brothers at the same time.

**Nonfraternal polyandry** Marriage of a woman to two or more men who are not brothers.

**Family** A social and economic unit consisting minimally of a parent and a child.

children may live away while they go to college. Some members of a family may deliberately set up separate households to manage multiple business enterprises while maintaining economic unity.108 In simpler societies, the family and the household tend to be indistinguishable; only in more complex societies, and in societies that become dependent on commercial exchange, may some members of a family live elsewhere.109

#### Adoption

In many societies, the family does not have enough kin in the nuclear or extended family. They need to add new members to perform all of the necessary chores or to inherit access to family property. There may be a shortage of family members because of infertility or deaths (particularly of young children) from introduced diseases or natural disasters, such as hurricanes or because the adults do not get along and cooperate in the traditional ways. Many societies adopt children to deal with one or another of these problems, or families adopt one or more related children to relieve the pressure on resources in the family that adopts the child "out."

The family Melvin Ember lived with at the beginning of his fieldwork in the Pacific islands of American Samoa had six children. The oldest, Tavita, was 11 at the time and in school most of the day, as were three of the other children. Tavita had been adopted informally. His natural mother, who lived in the same village, was a sister of Tavita's adoptive mother. By adopting Tavita "out," his natural family, which already had nine children, was relieved of the responsibility of feeding and caring for him. In addition to depopulation and hurricanes, reducing the number of mouths to feed was a common reason for adoption in Samoan villages then, as it was elsewhere in the

far Pacific islands.110 A number of factors generated unusual population growth, particularly the availability of more jobs and improved medical care (there was a medical dispensary in every village and a hospital on the main island).111

Of course, adoption occurs in industrial societies as well. As of the 1990s (the latest figures available), there have been more than 100,000 legally recognized adoptions in the United States per year. About 50 percent of the adoptions are of children who are relatives, and usually close relatives; a large number of these adoptions may be solutions to resource problems for the natural mothers. More than 10,000 children from abroad who are not usually relatives are adopted each year. Most of the known adoptions, foreign and domestic, are arranged by middle-class or wealthier people, since a sizeable amount of money may have been spent, particularly for foreign adoptions. Most of the adopted children, domestic and foreign, apparently turn out as well adjusted as natural children.112

### Variation in Family Form

The minimal family has one parent (or parent substitute). Single-parent families, usually headed by the mother, are common in some societies, but most societies typically have larger families. These larger family units usually include at least one **nuclear family** (a married couple and their children), but there is often polygamy, so there may be more than one spouse with more than one set of children. If a single-parent family, nuclear family, polygynous, or polyandrous family lives alone, each is an **independent family**. However, the **extended family** is the prevailing form of family in more than half the societies known to anthropology.113 It may consist of two or more single-parent, monogamous, polygynous, or polyandrous families linked by a blood tie. Most commonly, the extended family consists of a married couple and one or more of the married children, all living in the same house or household. The constituent nuclear families are normally linked through the parent-child tie. An extended family, however, is

# **Current Research and Issues**

#### **One-Parent Families: Why the Recent Increase?**

n most societies known to anthropology one-parent families are relatively uncommon. However, although some parents are clearly choosing to stay single, many might prefer to marry if they could find an appropriate spouse. In some countries, and among some ethnic groups within some countries, there are many fewer males than females, and sometimes a high proportion of the males have poor economic prospects. In the former Soviet Union, males are more likely to have died from war, alcoholism, and accidents. The United States does not have such a skewed sex ratio, but in some neighborhoods, particularly poor neighborhoods, there are very high mortality rates for young males, and many males in such neighborhoods do not have work. In a study by Daniel Lichter and his colleagues, an estimated 80 African American men were available for every 100 African American women between the ages of 21 and 28. Counting only the men who are employed full- or part-time, the number of available men per 100 women dropped below 50. A recent comparison of 85 countries finds that single parenthood is much more likely when there is higher male unemployment and there are also fewer men than women of a comparable age. There may be considerable merit to the argument that one-parent families, usually headed by women, will be likely when a spouse (particularly an employed one) is hard to find.

Another popular explanation for the rise in number of one-parent families is that, in contrast to the past, women can manage without husbands because of support from the state. This scenario seems to fit Sweden, where unmarried and divorced mothers receive many social supports and allowances for maternity and educational leave. But Iceland has few social supports from the government and yet has the highest rate of out-of-wedlock births of all the Scandinavian countries. In the United States, the welfare argument fails to predict changes over time. The program called Aid to Families with Dependent Children provided aid largely to single mothers. If the theory about government help was correct, increases in such aid would generally predict increases in the percentage of mother-headed households. Yet the percentage of families receiving aid and the value of aid decreased during the 1970s, whereas the percentage of mother-headed households increased. In the 1980s, it was more difficult to go "on welfare," but the percentage of mother-headed households increased anyway.

Women might be more able to manage alone if they have high-paying employment, and therefore we might expect more one-parent families by choice as more women enter the job market. Work equity may explain the choices of some women, but recent research finds that employed women generally are more rather than less likely to marry.

There is, nevertheless, a general association between commercial economies and the possibility of one-parent families. Is there something about subsistence economies that promotes marriage and something about commercial economies that detracts from it? Although marriage is not universally based on love or companionship, it entails a great deal of economic and other kinds of interdependence, particularly in not-so-commercial economies. Market economies allow individuals other possibilities; goods and services can be bought and sold, and governments may take over functions that kin and family normally handle. Either by choice or necessity, the one-parent family is likely to remain an option for some people.

sometimes composed of families linked through a sibling tie. Such a family might consist of two married brothers, their wives, and their children. Extended families may be very large, containing many relatives and including three or four generations. For a diagram of these different types of family, see Figure 19.2.

### **Extended-Family Households**

In a society composed of extended-family households, marriage does not bring as pronounced a change in lifestyle as it does in our culture, where the couple typically moves to a new residence and forms an independent family unit. Newlyweds in extended families are assimilated into an existing family unit. Margaret Mead described such a situation in Samoa:

In most marriages there is no sense of setting up a new and separate establishment. The change is felt in the change of residence for either husband or wife and in the reciprocal relations which spring up between the two families. But the young couple live in the main household, simply receiving a bamboo pillow, a mosquito net and a pile of mats for their bed.... The wife works with all the women of the household and waits on all the men. The husband shares the enterprises of the other men and boys. Neither in personal service given or received are the two marked off as a unit. $^{114}$ 

A young couple in Samoa, as in other societies with extended families, generally has little decision-making power over the governing of the household. Often the responsibility

### The Changing Family and "Social Security": A Look at Japan

uch of the world has seen major changes in demography and family structure. People are living longer and having fewer children. Women are more often working for wages, and fewer generations are living together. These changes make it much more difficult for family to provide "social security" for the older generation as they have done in the past. In the course of this transition, governments have been pushed to step in and provide some programs for retirees, for those unable to work, and for the elderly who lack family support.

Anthropologists and other social scientists can play a significant role in helping governments to craft or change their policies. They can share their knowledge of the cultural practices, beliefs, and attitudes that must be considered when social policy is crafted for a particular group. They can identify how cultural models and expectations have changed over time. They can help uncover the stresses and ambivalences that suggest how cultures are changing or even what kinds of public programs people may be ready to accept. As an example of the insights anthropologists can share, let us look at Japan, which happens to have the most aging population in the world combined with one of the lowest birth rates.

Prior to World War II, the ideal and typical Japanese family was a small extended family of three generations—in the first generation was a married couple, in the second generation, the eldest son and his wife, and in the third generation, the unmarried children. If there were only daughters, it was common to adopt a daughter's husband as a son. The head of the household was the oldest male, who passed on the role to his eldest son. Although the eldest son was technically responsible for the care of his parents, it was his wife who did most of the work of caring for her in-laws. This cultural model, called "filial piety," worked less well after World War II. The Allied occupation of Japan made the legal family the nuclear family and declared that inheritance should be equal across siblings, including daughters. Also, in the last quarter of the 20th century, Japanese women's attitudes toward their family roles changed and the expression "Never marry the eldest son" was coined. Increasingly, newly married women negotiated living quarters separate from their in-laws. Is the cultural model of filial piety gone in Japan? Changes in the country's social structure would indicate that it is; after all, threegeneration families constituted only 9 percent of Japanese families in 2008.

Given such broad social changes, we would expect the public to embrace the new programs Japan began providing for the elderly and frail in the 1990s, including some residential facilities, home care services, bath services, and day care. In 2000, the Japanese government established a mandatory long-term-care insurance program whereby everyone over 65 who needs care gets services and equipment, though what is received is decided by the elderly person in conjunction with family members. Day care has come to be commonly used at least a few days a week, particularly because of the large public baths at the centers. Bathing was particularly difficult to manage at home, and it was a service tailored to the needs of both caregivers and recipients.

But the extended family still exists as a "moral" entity: Parents continue to be viewed as important guides in the decisions of their adult children. and half of Japanese over 65 still live with their children. The Japanese still have the strong sense that the best caretaker is an adult child. Nursing homes are viewed as dumping grounds resorted to by unfilial children.

At the same time, the form filial piety is taking may be changing. Interviews with women suggest that there is considerable ambivalence regarding the tradition of caring for a mother-in-law. The young women who said "Never marry the eldest son" and chose to live in a nuclear household in the late 20th century are now voicing their opinions about who they prefer to embrace in their filial piety. They would rather take care of their own aqing mothers, not their mothers-in-law.

Researchers do not pretend to have the answers for what works or how care for the elderly is paid for, but they can provide insights into what people consider important, what they are ambivalent about, and, therefore, what might work. As is clear from a look at Japan's "social security" problem, cultures are a nuanced and complicated audience for policy makers.

of running the household rests with the senior male. Nor can the new family accumulate its own property and become independent; it is a part of the larger corporate structure:

So the young people bide their time. Eventually, when the old man dies or retires, they will own the homestead, they will run things. When their son grows up and marries, he will create a new subsidiary family to live with them, work for the greater glory of their extended family homestead, and wait for them to die.<sup>115</sup>

The extended family is more likely than the independent nuclear family to perpetuate itself as a social unit. In contrast with the independent nuclear family, which by definition disintegrates with the death of its senior members (the parents), the extended family is always adding junior families (monogamous, polygamous, or both), whose members become the senior members when their elders die.

At the top are four types of independent family assuming only two children (one male, one female) and only two spouses where multiple spouses are allowed. At the bottom are two types of extended family. These diagrams show only small extended families, but extended families can have many constituent family units if there are many children as well as plural marriages.

# Possible Reasons for Extended-Family Households

Why do most societies known to anthropology have extended-family households? Such households usually occur in sedentary, agricultural societies, suggesting that the type of economy could be a determining factor. Agricultural life, as opposed to a hunter-gatherer life, may favor extended families. The extended family may be a social mechanism that prevents the economically ruinous division of family property in societies in which property such as cultivated land is important. Conversely, the need for mobility in hunter-gatherer societies may make it difficult to maintain extended-family households. During certain seasons, the huntergatherers may be obliged to divide into nuclear families that scatter into other areas.116

But agriculture is only a weak predictor of extended-family households. Many agriculturalists lack them, and many nonagricultural societies have them. A different theory is that extended-family households come to prevail in societies that have incompatible activity requirements—that is, requirements that cannot be met by a mother or a father in a one-family household. In other words, extended-family households are generally favored when the work a mother has to do outside the home (cultivating fields or gathering foods far away) makes it difficult for her to also care for her children and do other household tasks. Similarly, extended families may be favored when the required outside activities of a father (warfare, trading trips, or wage labor far away) make it difficult for him to do the subsistence work required of males. There is cross-cultural evidence that societies with such incompatible activity requirements are more likely to have extended-family households than societies with compatible activity requirements, regardless of whether or not the society is agricultural. Even though they have incompatible activity requirements, however, societies with commercial or monetary exchange may not have extended-family households. In commercial societies, a family may be able to obtain the necessary help by "buying" the required services.117

19.8 Explain reasons for extended-family households.

Of course, even in societies with money economies, not everyone can buy required services. Those who are poor may need to live in extended families, and extended-family living may become more common even in the middle class when the economy is depressed. As a popular magazine noted,

*Whatever happened to the all-American nuclear family—Mom, Pop, two kids and a cuddly dog, nestled under one cozy, mortgaged roof? What happened was an economic squeeze: layoffs, fewer jobs for young people, more working mothers, a shortage of affordable housing and a high cost of living. Those factors, along with a rising divorce rate, a trend toward later marriages and an increase in the over-65 population, all hitting at once, are forcing thousands of Americans into living in multigenerational families.*<sup>118</sup>

In many societies, there are kin groups even larger than extended families. The next chapter discusses the varieties of such groupings.

# Summary and Review

## Marriage

19.1 Define marriage in anthropological terms.

- • Marriage is customary in nearly every known society, even though humans can survive and reproduce without marriage.
- • Although its form varies, marriage everywhere is understood to be a socially approved sexual and economic union, usually between a woman and a man.
- • Marriage is presumed, by both the couple and others, to be more or less permanent, and it subsumes reciprocal rights and obligations between the two spouses and between spouses and their future children.

What are some of the exceptions to the universality of marriage?

## Why Is Marriage Nearly Universal?

19.2 Explain the near-universality of marriage across cultures.

- • Various traditional explanations for marriage suggest that marriage solves problems found in all societies how to share the products of a gender division of labor; how to care for infants, who are dependent for a long time; and how to minimize sexual competition.
- • Marriage is not the only way to share the products of their labor, to support the prolonged dependency of infants, or to minimize sexual competition, so those explanations cannot explain near universality of marriage.

- • Comparative evidence on female-male bonding in mammals and birds does not support the traditional theories explaining near universality of marriage.
- • Bird and mammal species in which mothers cannot feed themselves and their babies at the same time *do* typically form male-female bonds, which may be true also for humans and may support a reason for marriage.

- • Marking the onset of marriage seems to be important, whether or not an actual ceremony takes place. Marriage ceremonies may symbolize hostility between the two families or promote harmony between them.
- • Marriage involves economic factors, explicit or not, in about 75 percent of the societies known to anthropology. Bride price is the most common form; bride service is second most common. Other forms include exchange of females, gift exchange, and forms of the dowry.

## Restrictions on Marriage: The Universal Incest Taboo

19.4 Critically assess different explanations for the universality of the incest taboo.

- • The incest taboo, found in *all* cultures, may be the most rigid regulation. The incest taboo prohibits sexual intercourse or marriage between some categories of kin, most universally, between mother and son, father and daughter, and brother and sister.
- • Childhood-familiarity theory says that people who have been closely associated with each other since earliest childhood are not sexually attracted to each other and would avoid marriage with each other, but it does not explain incest taboos for first-cousin marriage.
- • Freud's psychoanalytic theory proposed that the incest taboo is a reaction against unconscious, unacceptable desires, but it does not explain why society needs an explicit taboo nor does it account for some evidence of childhood aversion.
- • Family-disruption theory proposes that the familial incest taboo curtails sexual competition among family members to keep the family intact, but it does not adequately account for why independent adult brothers and sisters could not interact sexually.
- • Cooperation theory suggests that the incest taboo promotes cooperation among family groups by supporting interfamily marriage, thus helping communities to survive, but the evidence does not seem to support it.
- • Inbreeding theory focuses on the damaging biological consequences of the practice. Evidence supports that societies are aware of these dangers. Adaptive reproductive and hence competitive advantages probably accrued to groups practicing the taboo.

How might the universality of the familial incest taboo be explained? Critically assess the logic of the theories and the evidence.

## Whom Should One Marry?

19.5 Discuss the types of restrictions on whom one can marry.

- • In addition to the familial incest taboo, societies often have other rules regarding the mate such as whether they may be cousins, whether they should come from the same community, and even whether the couple has choice in the matter.
- • Parents invariably play a role, directly or indirectly, in who their offspring marry, including negotiating arranged marriages, which tend to increase economic

benefits. Arranged marriages are becoming less common, and couples have stronger voices in selecting partners.

- • Exogamy requires that the marriage partner come from outside one's own kin group or community. Endogamy obliges a person to marry within a particular group. The caste groups of India traditionally have been endogamous.
- • When first-cousin marriage is allowed, it is usually between cross-cousins (children of siblings of the opposite sex). Marriage among parallel cousins (children of siblings of the same sex) is rare, but some Muslim societies have preferred such marriages.
- • Large and densely populated societies may permit cousin marriages more often because such marriage are less likely in large populations. Small societies that have lost many people to epidemics may permit cousin marriage to provide enough mating possibilities.
- • Cultural rules that oblige individuals to marry the spouse of a deceased relative are exceedingly common. The levirate custom obliges a man to marry his brother's widow; the sororate custom obliges a woman to marry her deceased sister's husband.

What are some of the ways cultures restrict or express preferences for whom one marries?

## How Many Does One Marry?

19.6 Describe the three different rules regarding how many persons one can marry, and explain social or economic reasons for each.

- • Most Western societies allow only monogamy (one spouse at a time) and prohibit polygamy (plural spouse marriage). However, most societies known to anthropology have allowed some form of polygamy polygyny, or more rarely polyandry or group marriage.
- • Polygyny, the form of marriage that allows a man to be married to more than one woman at the same time, has been and is very common, especially among those with high status. Evidence seems to show that polygyny provides economic and political advantages.
- • The theory that polygyny is permitted in societies that have a long postpartum sex taboo predicts it less strongly than explanations that it is a response to an excess of women over men and that a society will allow polygyny when men marry at an older age than women.
- • Polyandry, the marriage of one woman to more than one man at the same time, is practiced in just a few societies. Polyandry may be practiced when there are a shortage of women or as an adaptive response to severely limited resources.

• Group marriage, in which more than one man is married to more than one woman at the same time, sometimes occurs but is not customary in any known society.

How are monogamy, polygyny, and polyandry defined, and what may explain why each form is preferred in societies that practice that form?

## The Family

19.7 Describe and explain variation in family form.

- • All societies have families, but family forms vary considerably. A family is a social and economic unit consisting minimally of one or more parents (or parent substitute) and their children. Family members have reciprocal rights and obligations, particularly economic ones.
- • Adoption occurs when a family does not have enough kin to perform chores or to inherit or when one family needs to relieve pressure on resources.
- • The extended family is the prevailing form of family in more than half the societies known to anthropology and may consist of two or more single-parent, monogamous, polygynous, or polyandrous families linked by a blood tie.
- • In most societies known to anthropology, one-parent families are relatively uncommon. However, in many Western countries there has been a dramatic increase recently in the percentage of one-parent families, most of which are female-headed.
- • Single parenthood occurs more with higher male unemployment and lower ratios of men to women of comparable age and in commercial economies. Evidence does not support the idea that singleparenthood increases because the state supports women to manage independently.

• Marriage in an extended family does not bring as pronounced a change in lifestyle as it does when marriage forms an independent unit. The extended family is more likely than the independent nuclear family to perpetuate itself as a social unit.

## Possible Reasons for Extended-Family Households

19.8 Explain reasons for extended-family households.

- • Extended-family households usually occur in sedentary, agricultural societies and may be a social mechanism that prevents economically damaging division of family property. But agriculture is only a weak predictor of extended-family households.
- • Another theory is that extended-family households are generally favored when a mother's work outside the home makes it difficult to also care for her children and do household tasks or when the required outside activities of a father interfere with subsistence tasks.
- • Cross-cultural evidence supports the above theory, regardless of whether or not the society is agricultural. However, in commercial societies, a family may be able to obtain the necessary help by "buying" the required services.
- • In the United States, layoffs, fewer jobs, more working mothers, affordable housing shortages, high costs, a rising divorce rate, increasingly later marriages, and increases in the over-65 population are leading to increases in the number of extended families.

How would you describe and explain variation in family form?

# Think on it

- 1. Will it remain customary in our society to marry? Why do you think it will or will not?
- 2. Do you think extended-family households will become more common in our society? Why?
- 3. Why is polyandry so much less common than polygyny?
