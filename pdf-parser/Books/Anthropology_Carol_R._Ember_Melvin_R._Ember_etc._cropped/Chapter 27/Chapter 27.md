lmost every day, the news makes us aware that terrible social problems threaten people ðŸ“£ around the world. War, crime, family violence, natural disasters, poverty, famineâ€”all these and more are the lot of millions of people in many places. And now there is an increasing threat of terrorism. Can anthropological and other research help us solve these global social problems? Many anthropologists and other social scientists think so.

High-tech communications have increased our awareness of problems all over the world, and we seem to be increasingly more aware of, and bothered by, problems in our own society. For these two reasons, and perhaps also because we know much more than we used to about human behavior, we may be more motivated now to try to solve those problems. We call them "social problems" not just because a lot of people worry about them but also because they have social causes and consequences, and treating or solving them requires changes in social behavior.

The idea that we can solve social problems, even the enormous ones such as war and family violence, is based on two assumptions. First, we have to assume that it is possible to discover the causes of a problem. And second, we have to assume that we may be able to do something about the causes, once they are discovered, and thereby eliminate or reduce the problem. Not everyone would agree with these assumptions. Some would say that our understanding of a social problem cannot ever be sufficient to suggest a solution guaranteed to work. To be sure, no understanding in science is perfect or certain; there is always some probability that even a well-supported explanation is wrong or incomplete. But the uncertainty of knowledge does not rule out the possibility of application. With regard to social problems, the possible payoff from even incomplete understanding could be a better and safer world. This possibility is what motivates many researchers who investigate social problems. After all, the history of the various sciences strongly supports the belief that scientific understanding can often allow humans to control nature, not just predict and explain it. Why should human behavior be any different?

So what do we know about some of the global social problems, and what policies or solutions are suggested by what we know?

27.1 Explain how cultural, economic, and social factors can cause or exacerbate natural events and cause disasters and famine.

# Natural Events, Disasters, and Famine

Natural events such as floods, droughts, earthquakes, and insect infestations are usually but not always beyond human control, but their effects are not.<sup>1</sup> We call such events accidents or emergencies when only a few people are affected, but we call them disasters when large numbers of people or large areas are affected. The harm caused is not just a function of the magnitude of the natural event. Between 1980 and 2002, the United States had slightly more earthquakes than India. Yet over 32,000 people died in those earthquakes compared to about 140 people in the United States. More broadly, richer countries have lower death tolls even though there is no significant differences in exposure to natural shocks or their magnitude between rich and poor countries.<sup>2</sup> The vast majority of deaths occurred in lower income countries.<sup>3</sup> These comparative figures demonstrate that climatic and other events in the physical environment become worse disasters because of events or conditions in the social environment.

If people live in houses that are designed to withstand earthquakesâ€”if governing bodies require such construction and the economy is developed enough so that people can afford such constructionâ€”the effects of an earthquake will be minimized. If poor people are forced to live in deforested floodplains to be able to find land to farm (as in coastal Bangladesh), if the poor are forced to live in shanties built on precarious hillsides (like those of Rio de Janeiro), the floods and landslides that follow severe hurricanes and rainstorms can kill thousands and even hundreds of thousands.

Thus, because natural events can have greater or lesser effects on human life, depending on social conditions, they are also social problems, problems that have social causes and possible social solutions. Legislating safe construction of a house is a social solution. The 1976 earthquake in Tangsham, China, killed 250,000 people, mostly because they lived in top-heavy adobe houses that could not withstand severe shaking, whereas the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in California, which was of comparable intensity, killed 65 people.

A family in Sichuan gathers for a meal outside their home after a 2013 earthquake. Tens of thousands of homeless survivors of China's devastating quake are living in makeshift tents or on the streets, facing shortages of food and supplies as well as an uncertain future.

One might think that floods, of all disasters, are the least influenced by social factors. After all, without a huge runoff from heavy rains or snow melt, there cannot be a flood. But consider why so many people have died from Hwang River floods in China. (One such flood, in 1931, killed nearly 4 million people, making it the deadliest single disaster in history.) The floods in the Hwang River basin have occurred mostly because the clearing of nearby forests for fuel and farmland has allowed enormous quantities of silt to wash into the river, raising the riverbed and increasing the risk of floods that burst the dams that normally would contain them. The risk of disastrous flooding would be greatly reduced if different social conditions prevailedâ€”if people were not so dependent on firewood for fuel, if they did not have to farm close to the river, or if the dams were higher and more numerous.

*Famines*, episodes of severe starvation and resultant death, often appear to be triggered by physical events such as a severe drought or a hurricane that kills or knocks down food trees and plants. But famines do not inevitably follow such an event. Social conditions can prevent a famine or increase the likelihood of one. Consider what is likely to happen in Samoa after a hurricane.4 Whole villages that have lost their coconut and breadfruit trees, as well as their taro patches, pick up and move for a period of time to other villages where they have relatives and friends. The visitors stay and are fed until some of their cultivated trees and plants start to bear food again, at which point they return home. This kind of intervillage reciprocity probably could occur only in a society that has relatively little inequality in wealth. Nowadays, the central government or international agencies may also help out by providing food and other supplies.

Researchers point out that famine rarely results from just one bad food production season. During one bad season, people can usually cope by getting help from relatives, friends, and neighbors or by switching to less desirable foods. The 1974 famine in the African Sahel occurred after eight years of bad weather; a combination of drought, floods, and a civil war in 1983 to 1984 contributed to the subsequent famine in the Sahel, Ethiopia, and Sudan.5 Famine almost always has some social causes. Who has rights to the available food, and do those who have more food distribute it to those who have less? Cross-cultural research suggests that societies with individual property rights rather than shared rights are more likely to suffer famine.6 Nonetheless, government assistance can lessen the risk of famine in societies with individual property.

Relief provided by government may not always get to those who need it the most. In fact, famine can occur in countries that have adequate food but that fail to distribute it to populations with severe food stress.<sup>7</sup> Or, if food is distributed, it may not be equitable. In India, for example, the central government provides help in time of drought to minimize the risk of famine. But the food and other supplies provided to a village may end up being unequally distributed, following the rules of social and gender stratification. Members of the local elite arrange to function as distributors and find ways to manipulate the relief efforts to their advantage. Lower-class and lower-caste families still suffer the most. Within the family, biases against females, particularly young girls and elderly women, translate into their getting less food. It is no wonder, then, that in times of food shortage and famine, the poor and other socially disadvantaged people are especially likely to die.8

Considerable progress has been made in eliminating famine. There have been no famines in Europe since the 1940s and none in Asia since the 1970s. Contemporary famines are now confined to sub-Saharan Africa. Why do they persist? Since a majority of Africans produce their own food, failures of production are partially to blame. But for a famine to occur, there also must be exchange failures (inability to barter or purchase food). In addition, a famine will only result if social support networks, governments, or the international community provide inadequate help. The famine of 1999â€“2000 in Ethiopia in the pastoral Somali region followed a multi-year drought in 1997 and 1998. Both drought and disease killed many livestock. The Somali relied heavily on sales of livestock to the Middle East, and the loss of cash meant that they could not buy sufficient food. Ethiopia had an "early warning system" in place, but it focused on the highland areas, not the lowlands where the pastoralists lived. Some NGOs sounded warnings, but they were ignored until the BBC started broadcasting information. By the time information got out, the response by the international community could not avert much of the loss of life.9

Thus, the people of a society may not all be equally at risk in case of disaster. In socially stratified societies, the poor particularly suffer. They are likely to be forced to overcultivate, overgraze, and deforest their land, making it more susceptible to degradation. A society most helps those it values the most.

People in the past, and even recently in some places, viewed extreme natural events as divine retribution for human immorality. For example, the great flood described in the Old Testament was understood to be God's doing. But scientific research increasingly allows us to understand the natural causes of disasters, and particularly the social conditions that magnify or minimize their effects. To reduce the impact of disasters, then, we need to reduce the social conditions that magnify the effects of disasters. If humans are responsible for those social conditions, humans can change them. If earthquakes destroy houses that are too flimsy, we can build stronger houses. If floods caused by overcultivation and overgrazing kill people directly (or indirectly by stripping their soils), we can grow new forest cover and provide new job opportunities to floodplain farmers. If prolonged climate-related disasters or wars threaten famine, social distribution systems can lessen the risk. In short, we may not be able to do much about the weather or other physical causes of disasters, but we can do a lotâ€”if we want toâ€”about the social factors that make disasters disastrous. The challenge isâ€”how do you make people want to?

27.2 Describe the factors that lead to inadequate housing and homelessness.

# Inadequate Housing and Homelessness

The world's urban population, particularly in developing countries, is growing rapidly. In 2010, a slight majority of the people in the world lived in urban areas, and it is projected to be about 70 percent by 2050.10 But rapid growth is occurring in places with inadequate ability to provide decent infrastructure. And so, in most nations, those who are poor typically live in inadequate housing, in areas we call *slums*. In many of the developing nations, where cities are growing very rapidly, squatter settlements emerge as people build dwellings (often makeshift) that are typically declared illegal, either because the land is illegally occupied or because the dwellings violate building codes. Squatter settlements are often located in degraded environments that are subject to flooding and mudslides or have inadequate or polluted water.11 The magnitude of the problem is made clear in some statistics. As of 2012, it was estimated that 1 billion people or about 33 percent of urban dwellers lived in slums. In some world regions, the slum problem is much worse. In Africa,

62 percent of urban dwellers live in slums.12 Four in ten of the nonpermanent houses in slums were in high-risk environments such as flood zones or landslide-prone areas.13

But contrary to what some people have assumed, not all dwellers in illegal settlements are poor; all but the upper-income elite may be found in such settlements.14 Moreover, although squatter settlements have problems, they are not chaotic and unorganized places that are full of crime. Most of the dwellers are employed, aspire to get ahead, live in intact nuclear families, and help each other.15 People live in such settlements because they cannot find affordable housing, and they house themselves as best they can. Many researchers think that such self-help tendencies should be assisted to improve housing because governments in developing countries can seldom afford costly public housing projects. But they could invest somewhat in infrastructureâ€”sewers, water supplies, roadsâ€”and provide construction materials to those who are willing to do the work required to improve their dwellings.16 In some countries, the urban slum and shack dwellers have organized into more formal local collective action groups that have even joined into international alliances with the support of some NGOs. Local federations have pushed for co-production, which means that the local collective action group becomes actively engaged in design, implementation, and management of improvements to their communities.17 Thailand is one of the countries that supports these collective efforts to upgrade slums by offering subsidies and soft loans. But the communities must first form community savings groups before they can get government assistance. They then need to negotiate for land to lease or buy collectively. The cooperative can then make plans and loans to individuals. The importance of collective ownership is not only that it fosters working together for a collective good, but it also prevents individuals from selling out as soon as their house is upgraded.18

Housing in slum areas or shantytowns does provide shelter, minimal though it may be. But many people in many areas of the world have no homes at all. Even in countries such as the United States, which is affluent by world standards, large numbers of people are homeless. They sleep in parks, over steam vents, in doorways, subways, and cardboard boxes. Homelessness is difficult to measure. In 1987, more than 1 million people were estimated to be homeless in the United States.19 About 3.5 million people experienced homelessness in 2000, almost 40 percent of them children. Most researchers agree that homelessness has increased in the last few decades; the United States Conference of Mayors reported increases after the recession in 2007.20

Who are the homeless, and how did they get to be homeless? We have relatively little research on these questions, but what we do have suggests differences in the causes of homelessness in different parts of the world. In the United States, unemployment and the shortage of decent low-cost housing appear to be at least partly responsible for the large number of homeless people.21 But there is also another factor: the deliberate policy to reduce the number of people hospitalized for mental illness and other disabilities. For example, from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s, New York State released thousands of patients from mental hospitals. Many of these ex-patients had to live in cheap hotels or poorly monitored facilities with virtually no support network. With very little income, they found it especially hard to cope with their circumstances. Ellen Baxter and Kim Hopper, who studied the homeless in New York City, suggest that one event is rarely sufficient to render a person homeless. Rather, poverty and disability (mental or physical) seem to lead to one calamity after another and, finally, homelessness.22

Many people cannot understand why homeless individuals do not want to go to municipal shelters, but observations and interviews with the homeless individuals suggest that violence pervades the municipal shelters, particularly the men's shelters. Many feel safer on the streets. Some private charities provide safe shelters and a caring environment. These shelters are filled, but the number of homeless people they can accommodate is small.23 Even single-room-occupancy hotels are hardly better. Many of them are infested with vermin, the common bathrooms are filthy, and they, like the shelters, are often dangerous.24

Some poor individuals may be socially isolated, with few or no friends and relatives and little or no social contact. But a society with many such individuals does not necessarily have much homelessness. Socially isolated individuals, even mentally ill individuals, could still have housing, or so the experience of Melbourne, Australia, suggests. Universal health insurance there pays for health care as well as medical practitioners' visits to isolated and ill individuals, wherever they live. Disabled individuals receive a pension or sickness benefits sufficient to allow them to live in a room or apartment. And there is still a considerable supply of cheap

# **Applied Anthropology**

### **Climate Change: What Can Anthropologists Contribute** to Research and Policy?

limate change is a global concern. Scientists are about 90 percent certain that human activities, such as the burning of coal and fossil fuels, over the past 250 years have led to the world heating up. And they are worried about the worsening consequences. There is already increased melting of polar ice and the more the temperature rises, the more the higher sea level will flood low-lying coastal areas, including many world cities. Storms, floods, and droughts will continue to intensify. The weather will become even more erratic. Places at high latitudes are likely to see increased rainfall and snow; places at low latitudes are likely to have less rainfall and more drought. The earth normally traps heat in the atmosphere by gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane. These are called "greenhouse gases." And while some warmth is essential for life, the amounts of these gases have dramatically increased. Scientists have told us that the need to reduce greenhouse gases and prepare for more extreme conditions is now. But bringing about change is not easy.

Many environmental anthropologists use ethnographic methods to study how communities perceive changes in the weather and landscapes around them as well as the

measures they take to try to adapt. So, for example, Sakka horse and cattle breeders living in Siberia live in land with extreme temperature fluctuations from -76 degrees to 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Their cattle are in barns for nine months a year and live on hav gathered in the summer. But almost everyone notes that the climate has changed; winter and spring both come later, the weather is erratic, and there is so much rain in the summer that hay doesn't grow well and doesn't dry out. But the Sakka do not frame climate change the way we do. Some attribute the changes to the building of hydroelectric dams, others to rockets "mixing up" the sky. The Sakka adapted before around the year 1200 when they moved from more southerly climates to Siberia. But it is not clear that they can adapt now. The melting permafrost may turn their land into swampland unfit for animal husbandry.

Susan Crate points out that "global climate changeâ€”its causes, effects, and ameliorationâ€”is intimately and ultimately about culture (p. 570)," but it is the industrialized and post-industrial world that has largely caused global warmingâ€”therefore dramatic change will be needed in the cultural behavior of that world. Therefore, many argue

that cultural anthropologists need to broaden their horizons and become more engaged in understanding how policy is formulated by climate scientists and governments, and they need to work with interdisciplinary teams. They also need to show how the effects of climate change are related to the broader social, political, and economic context of the people they study, and finally, they need to engage moreâ€”both by making the situation known of the people they study and engaging in projects that plan and pursue how to cope with climate change.

Understanding how societies have responded to climate change in the past is an important component. Archaeologists have studied livelihoods, the interaction of groups, and changes in local environments in the past. In some places, decades-long or century-long droughts have led to extreme changesâ€”abandonment of sites, regional collapses, and movements to other places; smaller environmental changes, such as the Little Ice Age in Europe; and decreased agricultural productivity.

housing in Melbourne. Research in Melbourne suggests that a severe mental disorder often precedes living in marginal accommodationsâ€”city shelters, commercial shelters, and cheap single rooms. About 50 percent of the people living in such places were diagnosed as previously having some form of mental illness; this percentage is similar to what seems to be the case for homeless people and people living in marginal accommodations in the United States.

The contrast between the United States and Australia makes it clear that social and political policies cause homelessness. Individuals with similar characteristics live in both Australia and the United States, but a larger percentage of them are homeless in the United States.<sup>25</sup> As Kim Hopper noted, perhaps the important question is not what makes some people homeless but rather why the rest of the people in a society tolerate homelessness.<sup>26</sup>

Because homelessness cannot occur if everybody can afford housing, some people would say that homelessness can happen only in a society with great extremes in income. Statistics on income distribution in the United States clearly show that, since the 1970s, the rich have gotten much richer and the poor have gotten much poorer.<sup>27</sup> The United States now has more income inequality than any country in Western Europe and more than most high-income countries. In fact, the profile of inequality in the United States more closely resembles that of developing countries, such as Cambodia and Morocco $^{28}$  (see the discussion in the chapter on social stratification).

In the United States and many other countries, most homeless people are adults. Whereas adults are "allowed" to be homeless, public sensibilities in the United States appear to be outraged by the sight of children living in the streets; when authorities discover homeless children, they try to find shelters or foster homes for them. But many countries have "street children." In the late 1980s, 80 million of the world's children lived in the streets: 40 million in Latin America, 20 million in Asia, 10 million in Africa and the Middle East, and 10 million elsewhere.29 In the 2000s, the estimated number grew to about 150 million worldwide.30

Lewis Aptekar, who studied street children in Cali, Colombia, reported some surprises.31 Whereas many of the homeless in the United States and Australia are mentally disabled, the street children in Cali, ranging in age from 7 to 16, are mostly free of mental problems; by and large, they also test normally on intelligence tests. In addition, even though many street children come from abusive homes or never had homes, they usually seem happy and enjoy the support and friendship of other street children. They cleverly and creatively look for ways to get money, frequently through entertaining passersby.

Although observers might think that the street children must have been abandoned by their families, most of them in actuality have at least one parent they keep in touch with. Street life begins slowly, not abruptly; children usually do not stay on the streets full time until they are about 13 years old. Though street children in Cali seem to be in better physical and mental shape than their siblings who stay at home, they often are viewed as a "plague." The street children come from poor families and cope with their lives as best they can, so why are they not viewed with pity and compassion? Aptekar suggests that well-off families see the street children as a threat because a life independent of family may appeal to children, even those from well-off families, who wish to be free of parental constraint and authority.

Whether people become homeless and whether they have shantytowns seem to depend on a society's willingness to share wealth and help those in need. The street children of Cali may remind us that children as well as adults need companionship and care. Addressbut it won't get them a "home."

# **Migrants and Immigrants**

#### **Refugees Are a Global Social Problem**

he continuing turmoil in many countries throughout the world has created a flow of refugees that is much larger than ever before in world history. An estimated 140 million people became refugees in the 20th century. In 2012 alone, over 45 million people were displaced; the highest number since 1994. More than half of the refugees in 2012 came from five countriesâ€”Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq, Syria, and Sudan. In the past, thousands of people might have had to flee persecution and war. Now that refugees number in the many millions per year, the problems of how to minimize suffering and find long-term solutions are more complex. Refugees flee to other parts of the country (internally displaced persons), to neighboring countries, and some to countries on the other side of the world. The refugees from the civil wars in Somalia are not unusual; 10 percent of the Somali population is now living outside of Somalia, perhaps a million people altogether. Much of the burden of sheltering refugees falls to nearby countries. For example, over 640,000 have sought refuge from the Syrian conflict in Iraq, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt. Often people are channeled into refugee camps where the United Nations and other international agencies try to find "durable" solutions. Voluntary repatriation is considered the ideal solution, but it requires that the conflict be over and that the home country is willing to protect and reintegrate those who have fled. The process, however, can be a long one, especially if conflict is protracted. Resettlement in other countries is another option, but not that many countries are willing to take a large number of people. For example, in 2012, half a million refugees were repatriated,

![](_page_7_Picture_4.jpeg)

but only about 89,000 people were resettled in other countries (the United States received about 66,000 people).

What is often not realized about refugees is that often families strategize about who stays and who goes. Persecution is real, but it takes resources to flee. That is, those who are better off in the first place have the best chance to flee the furthest. Those family members who do get out may be able to channel money to other family members back home to help them leave as well.

Almost all people seeking refuge are fleeing conflict. Therefore the ultimate answer to the problem of refugees has to be to prevent those conflicts in the first place or to minimize their escalation.

Some researchers are predicting that a whole new type of refugee problem will soon emergeâ€”"climate change refugees." With changes in

climate, millions of people will be forced to leave their homes because of flooding or worsening drought. The crisis is likely to be worse in developing countries that haven't been able to commit resources to adapt to climate changes. Migration may be the only choice for some nations like Tuvalu, which consists of low-lying islands in the Pacific. One estimate is that by 2050 there will be over 200 million climate refugees. The world has not only been slow to acknowledge climate change, but little has been done to plan for it. If there will be so many climate refugees, there will need to be some analogous mechanisms for coping with and resettling these refugees, just like some have developed for refugees fleeing persecution.

27.3 Discuss the magnitude, causes, and consequences of family violence.

# Family Violence and Abuse

In U.S. society, we hear regularly about the abuse of spouses and children, which makes us think that such abuse is increasingâ€”but is it? This seems to be a simple question, but it is not so simple to answer. We have to decide what we mean by *abuse*.

Is physical punishment of a child who does something wrong child abuse? Not so long ago, teachers in public schools in the United States were allowed to discipline children by hitting them with rulers or paddles, and many parents used switches or belts. Many would consider these practices to be child abuse, but were they abusive when they were generally accepted? Some would argue that abuse is going beyond what a culture considers appropriate behavior. Others would disagree and would focus on the violence and severity of parents' or teachers' behavior, not the cultural judgment of appropriateness. And abuse need not involve physical violence. It could be argued that verbal aggression and neglect may be just as harmful as physical aggression. Neglect presents its own problems of definition. People from other cultures might argue that we act abusively when we put an infant or child alone in a room to sleep.32 Few would disagree about severe injuries that kill a child or spouse or require medical treatment, but other disciplinary behaviors are more difficult to judge.

To avoid having to decide what is or is not abuse, many researchers focus their studies on variation in the frequencies of specific behaviors. For example, one can ask which societies have physical punishment of children without calling physical punishment abusive.

According to four national interview surveys of married or cohabiting couples in the United States conducted from 1975 onwards, physical violence against older children appears to have decreased in frequency over time, as did serious assaults by husbands against wives. But serious assaults by wives on husbands did not decrease.33 In fact, to many people's surprise, in over 200 studies of partner violence carried out mostly in the United States, husbands and wives commit about an equal number of attacks on their partners.34 Perhaps the perception that males commit more violence toward their wives stems from the fact that wives are more often injured. The United States remains a society with a lot of physical violence in families. By far the most violence is directed to children by parents. Ninety-four percent of parents report hitting a 3- to 5-year-old child during the year. (Parents often do not consider slapping or spanking violence.) Next most violent group are siblings to other siblings, then toddlers hitting parents. While parents being violent to each other is the rarest type of family violence in the family, it is far from rare. About 16 percent of men and women report experiencing violence from a partner.35 If we focus on crimes reported to the police, family violence accounted for 33 percent of all crimes, and nearly a quarter of murders were against a family member. And in terms of crime, females are more likely than males to be victims of family violence crimes, but males are more likely to experience violent crime from strangers and acquaintances.36 Just as women face more risk from those close to them, so do children. When a child is the target of violence, it usually comes from the birth mother.37

Cross-culturally, if one form of family violence occurs, others are also likely. So, for example, wife beating, husband beating, child punishment, and fighting among siblings are all significantly associated with each other. But the relationships among these types of family violence are not that strong, which means that they cannot be considered as different facets of the same phenomenon. Indeed, somewhat different factors seem to explain different forms of family violence.38 We focus here on two forms of violence that are most prevalent cross-culturally: violence against children and violence against wives.

#### Violence Against Children

Cross-culturally, many societies practice and allow infanticide. Frequent reasons for infanticide include illegitimacy, deformity of the infant, twins, too many children, or that the infant is unwanted. Infanticide is usually performed by the mother, but this does not mean that she is uncaring; it may mean that she cannot adequately feed or care for the infant or that it has a poor chance to survive. The reasons for infanticide are similar to those given for abortion. Therefore, it seems that infanticide may be performed when abortion does not work or when unexpected qualities of the infant (e.g., deformity) force the mother to reevaluate her ability to raise the child.39

Much of the violence directed at children is believed to be morally correctâ€”a necessary way of teaching children to behave. The old proverb warns: "Spare the rod and spoil the child." In recent years in the United States and elsewhere, there has been some turning away from corporal or bodily punishment, and more people in this country and elsewhere would like parents to stop spanking their children. They point to evidence that spanking and other corporal punishment is associated with a child later hitting others in kindergarten or elsewhere. Later in life, children who are corporally punished are more likely to

physically assault their dating partners or spouses, be convicted of a crime, and have bouts of depression.40 So it is possible that corporal punishment is a cradle of violence.

So if we want to reduce family violence, one thing we could do is reduce the conditions that predict corporal punishment of children. The frequency of corporal punishment does not vary that much from one country to another, and most approve of the practice. There is more variation in the cross-cultural record, and we can use that record to predict the variation.

Physical punishment of children occurs at least sometimes in over 70 percent of the world's societies.41 And physical punishment is frequent or typical in 40 percent of the world's societies.

The main predictors of corporal punishment in the ethnographic or cross-cultural record are two conditions that are practically universal in the nation-states of the world, namely, a money economy and a stratified social system. If parents want children to do well when they grow up in a world with power inequality, might parents practice corporal punishment to convey that some people (particularly employers) are much more powerful than others? To a child, parents are clearly powerful. Not only are they taller and physically stronger, they also control and dispense important resources (food, love). So, perhaps, parents may consciously or unconsciously think that, if children fear those who are more powerful, they may be less likely to get into trouble and more likely to be able to get and keep a job.42 Research in the United States is consistent with the cross-cultural finding: Those at the bottom of the socioeconomic hierarchy are more likely than those at the top to practice corporal punishment of children.43 Unfortunately, parents probably do not realize that physical punishment may produce more violent behavior in their children, an outcome they probably do not want or intend. Donna Goldstein poignantly describes the plight of a woman in a shantytown near Rio de Janeiro who supports more than 10 children in a one-room shack. Her discipline is harsh, but she is trying, as Goldstein points out, to ensure that the kids "have the skills, as well as the attitudes of obedience, humility, and subservience, necessary for a poor black person to survive in urban Brazil."44

Do these results suggest how corporal punishment of children could decrease? At one level, it is difficult to see how. Societies that use money and have social classes are not likely to become egalitarian. But societies could move in the direction of de-emphasizing economic and power inequality. When parents hit their children, it is generally not because they want their children to be violent; they want them to behave properly. If they understood the connection between parental violence and child violence, they might begin to change their practices.

Some countries already have not-so-high rates of corporal punishment. These are the more democratic countriesâ€”with contested elections that allow people to replace leaders peacefully, and laws that protect civil rights such as the right to express dissent. (The agreement to disagree, and protecting civil rights, means that you don't have to worry so much about losing your job if you disagree with your employer's beliefs.) Sweden and the other Scandinavian countries have lower rates of approval of corporal punishment. Is this because Scandinavia is more democratic, allowing people (even workers in factories) to participate more in decision making in the workplace and not just in elections? We think so. But only time will tell if increasing democracy, and less need for workers to act subservient, will translate into less violent ways of socializing children.

#### Violence Against Wives

Cross-culturally, wife beating is a common form of family violence; it occurs at least occasionally in about 85 percent of the world's societies. In about half the societies, wife beating is sometimes serious enough to cause permanent injury or death.45 It is often assumed that wife beating is common in societies in which males control economic and political resources. In a cross-cultural test of this assumption, David Levinson found that not all indicators of male dominance predict wife beating, but many do. Specifically, wife beating is most common when men control the products of family labor, when men have the final say in decision making in the home, when divorce is difficult for women, when remarriage for a widow is controlled by the husband's kin, or when women do not have any female work groups.46 Similarly, in the United States, the more one spouse in the family makes the decisions and has the power, the more physical violence occurs in the family. Wife beating is even more likely when the husband controls the household and is out of work.47

When we compare countries, although wife beating is widespread, there is very wide variability in prevalence. For example, in Japan, 13 percent of women report ever experiencing violence from their male partner, but it is reported as high as 61 percent in rural Peru.48

In some places, such as the United States and other Western countries, women are about as equally likely to be violent toward their husbands as their husbands are to them. So wife beating seems unlikely to be caused by gender inequality. As it turns out, degree of gender empowerment, or the relative emancipation of women, does predict the variability among nations. The United States and many other Western countries do not have gender equality, but they have more equality than countries like India, Korea, and Jordan. And it is in the countries with more equality that male and female partners are about equal in their propensity to hit each other; it is in the more male-dominated countries that males are much more likely to hit their spouses than the other way around. It is also the case that in such countries, wife beating tends to be approved of.49

Wife beating appears to be related to broader patterns of violence. Societies that have violent methods of conflict resolution within communities, physical punishment of criminals, high frequency of warfare, and cruelty toward enemies generally have more wife beating.50

#### Reducing the Risk

What can be done to minimize family violence? First, we have to recognize that probably nothing can be done as long as people in a society do not acknowledge that a problem exists. If severe child punishment and wife beating are perfectly acceptable to almost everyone in a society, they are unlikely to be considered social problems that need solutions. In our own society, many programs are designed to take abused children or wives out of the family situation or to punish the abuser. (Of course, in these situations, the violence has already occurred and was serious enough to have been noticed.) Cross-culturally, at least with respect to wife beating, intervention by others seems to be successful only if the intervention occurs before violence gets serious. As one would expect, however, those societies most prone to a high rate of wife beating are the least likely to practice immediate intervention. More helpful perhaps, but admittedly harder to arrange, is the promotion of conditions of life that are associated with low family violence. Research so far suggests that promoting the equality of men and women and the sharing of childrearing responsibilities may go a long way toward lessening incidents of family violence.51 And reducing the risk of corporal punishment of children may reduce the risk of violence when they have families.

# Crime

What is a crime in one society is not necessarily a crime in another. Just as it is difficult to decide what constitutes abuse, it is difficult to define *crime*. In one society, it may be a crime to walk over someone's land without permission; in another, there might not be any concept of personal ownership and therefore no concept of trespassing. In seeking to understand variation in crime, many researchers have not surprisingly preferred to compare those behaviors that are more or less universally considered crimes and that are reliably reported. For example, in a large-scale comparison of crime in 110 nations over a span of 70 years, Dane Archer and Rosemary Gartner concentrated on homicide rates. They argued that homicide is harder for the public to hide and for officials to ignore than other crimes. A comparison of interviews about crime with police records suggests that homicide is the most reliably reported crime in official records.52

Nations not only have very different crime rates when we compare them at a given point in time, the rates also vary over time within a nation. In the last 600 years, homicide rates have generally declined in Western societies. In England, where homicide rates have been well documented for centuries, the chance of murder during the 13th and 14th centuries was 10 times higher than in England today. Around 2010, some of the lowest homicide rates were found in Norway, Austria, Hong Kong, Japan, Bahrain, and Oman. Some of the highest homicide rates were in Jamaica, El Salvador, and Venezuala. The United States has a higher homicide rate than almost any of the countries in Europe.<sup>53</sup>

One of the clearest findings to emerge from comparative studies of crime is that war is associated with higher rates of homicide. Archer and Gartner compared changes in homicide rates of nations before and after major wars. Whether a nation is defeated or victorious, homicide rates tend to increase after a war. This result is consistent with the idea that a society or nation legitimizes violence during wartime. That is, during wartime, societies approve of

27.4 Explain how cultural and societal features relate to crime, especially in regard to homicide.

killing the enemy; afterward, homicide rates may go up because inhibitions against killing have been relaxed.54 Ted Gurr suggested that the long-term downtrend in crime in Western societies seems to be consistent with an increasing emphasis on humanistic values and nonviolent achievement of goals. But such goals may be temporarily suspended during wartime. In the United States, for example, surges in violent crime rates occurred during the 1860s and 1870s (during and after the Civil War), after World War I, after World War II, and during the Vietnam War.55 But recently the homicide rate in the United States has declined.56

In the types of societies that anthropologists have typically studied, homicide statistics are not often available. However, where statistics are available the variation appears to be much greater than among modern nations. Nations vary from about .5 homicides per 100,000 people to about 52 per 100,000. Using statistics calculated by anthropologists, the range is from about 1 to 683.57 Thus, some of the highest homicide rates described are more than 10 times the rate of any known country today. Cross-cultural studies of homicide usually measure homicide rates by comparing and rank-ordering ethnographers' statements about the frequency of homicide. For example, the statement that murder is "practically unheard of" is taken to mean that the murder rate is lower than where it is reported that "homicide is not uncommon." Despite the fact that the data on cultural homicide rates are not quantitative, the cross-cultural results are consistent with the cross-national results; more war is usually associated with more homicide and assault, as well as with socially approved aggressive behaviors (as in aggressive games) and severe physical punishment for wrongdoing.58 A cross-cultural study suggests that the more war a society has, the more the society socializes or trains boys in aggression, and such socialization strongly predicts higher rates of homicide and assault.59

Capital punishmentâ€”execution of criminalsâ€”is severe physical punishment for wrongdoing. It is commonly thought that the prospect of capital punishment deters would-be murderers. Yet, cross-national research suggests otherwise. More countries show murder rates going down rather than up after capital punishment was abolished.60 Capital punishment may legitimize violence rather than deter it.

Research conducted in the United States suggests that juvenile delinquents (usually boys) are likely to come from broken homes, with the father absent for much of the time the boy is growing up. The conclusion often drawn is that father absence somehow increases the likelihood of delinquency and adult forms of physical violence. But other conditions that may cause delinquency are also associated with broken homes, conditions such as the stigma of not having a "regular" family and the generally low standard of living of such families. It is therefore important to conduct research in other societies, in which father absence does not occur in concert with these other factors, to see if father absence by itself is related to physical violence.

For example, in many polygynous societies, children grow up in a mother-child household; the father lives separately and is seldom around the child. Does the father absence explanation of delinquency and violence fit such societies? The answer is apparently yes: Societies in which children are reared in mother-child households, where fathers sleep at a distance, or the father spends little time caring for the child tend to have more physical violence by males than do societies in which fathers spend time with children.61 The rate of violent crime is also more frequent in nations that have more women than men, which is consistent with the theory that father absence increases violence.62

More research is needed to discover exactly what accounts for these relationships. It is possible, as some suggest, that boys growing up without fathers are apt to act "supermasculine" to show how "male" they are. But it is also possible that mothers who rear children alone have more frustration and more anger, and therefore are likely to provide an aggressive role model for the child. In addition, high male mortality in war and an excess of women predicts polygyny; therefore, boys in polygynous societies are likely to be exposed to a warrior tradition.63

Trying to act supermasculine, however, may be likely to involve violence only if aggression is an important component of the male gender role in society. If men were expected by society to be sensitive, caring, and nonviolent, boys who grew up without fathers might try to be supersensitive and supercaring. So society's expectations for males probably shape how growing up in a mother-child household affects behavior in adolescence and later.64 The media may also influence the expectations for males. Numerous studies in the United States show that, even controlling for other factors like parental neglect, family income, and mental illness, more television watching in childhood and adolescence predicts

Evidence indicates that violence on TV encourages violence in real life.

more overt aggression later. Estimates show that an hour of prime-time television depicts 3â€“5 violent acts, and an hour of children's television depicts 20â€“25 violent acts.65

One widely held idea is that poor economic conditions increase the likelihood of crime, but the relationship does not appear to be strong. Also, the findings are somewhat different for different types of crime. For example, hundreds of studies in this and other countries do not show a clear relationship between changes in economic wellbeing as measured by unemployment rates and changes in violent crime as measured by homicide. The rate of homicide does not appear to increase in bad times. Property crimes, however, do increase with increases in unemployment. There are some stressful conditions though that do predict more homicide. A high disease load is one such condition.66 Homicide is usually highest in nations or societies with high poverty and income inequality.67 Why income inequality predicts homicide but downturns in the economy do not is something of a puzzle.<sup>68</sup>

The fact that property crime is linked to unemployment is consistent with the crosscultural finding that theft (but not violent crime) tends to occur less often in egalitarian societies than in stratified ones. Societies with equal access to resources usually have distribution mechanisms that offset any differences in wealth. Hence, theft should be less of a temptation and therefore less likely in an egalitarian society. Theft rates are higher in socially stratified societies despite the fact that they are more likely than egalitarian societies to have police and courts to punish crime. Societies may try to deter property and other crimes when the rates of such are high, but we do not know that these efforts actually reduce the rates.

So what does the available research suggest about how we might be able to reduce crime? The results so far indicate that homicide rates are highest in societies that socialize their boys for aggression. Such socialization is linked to war and other forms of socially approved violenceâ€”capital punishment, television and movie violence by heroes, violence in sports. The statistical evidence suggests that war encourages socialization for aggression, which in turn results unintentionally in high rates of violence. The policy implication of these results is that, if we can reduce socialization for aggression by reducing the risk of war and therefore the necessity to produce effective warriors, and if we can reduce other forms of socially approved violence, we may thereby reduce the rates of violent crime. The reduction of inequalities in wealth may also help to reduce crime, particularly theft. And although it is not yet clear why, it appears that raising boys with a male role model around may reduce the likelihood of male violence in adulthood.

27.5 Discuss warfare in terms of cultural, social, and ecological factors, and describe the reasons societies go to war.

# War

There are two important points to note about war. First, war is an unfortunate fact of life in most societies known to anthropology. Almost every society had at least occasional wars when it was first described, unless it had been pacified (usually by Western colonial powers).69 However, this does not imply that war is inevitable or "natural" since some societies were peaceful. Second, it is now fairly clear that warfare has declined over the long stretch of history.70 That being so, the presumption is that if warfare has already declined, it can continue to decline further.

Since the Civil War, the United States has not had any wars within its territory, but it is unusual in that respect. Before pacification, most societies in the ethnographic record had frequent armed combat among communities or larger units that spoke the same language. That is, most warfare was internal to the society or language group. Even some wars in modern times involved speakers of the same language; recall the wars among Italian states before the unification of Italy and many of the "civil" wars of the last two centuries. Although people in some societies might fight against people in other societies, such "external" wars were usually not organized on behalf of the entire society or even a major section of it.71 That is, warfare in the ethnographic record did not usually involve politically unified societies. The absolute numbers of people killed may have been small, but this does not mean that warfare in nonindustrial societies was a trivial matter. Indeed, it appears that nonindustrial warfare may have been even more lethal *proportionately* than modern warfare, judging by the fact that wars killed from 25 percent to 30 percent of the males in some nonindustrial societies.72

In nonindustrial societies, warfare appears to be more likely when there are unpredictable climate-related disasters (droughts, floods, hurricanes, among others) that destroy food supplies.73 Since warfare is not predicted by chronic food shortages, it seems that people may be motivated to fight mostly by fear of future loss. If so, we would expect them to take resources when they win. And they do. The victors in war almost always take resources (land, animals, other things) from the defeated, even when the victors have no current resource problems.74 The relationship between climate change and war has been analyzed over centuries in both China and Korea. Armed conflict appears to be greater in periods of worsening climate and more frequent disasters.75 Another factor apparently making for more war is teaching children to mistrust others. People who grow up to be mistrustful of others may be more likely to go to war than to negotiate or seek conciliation with "enemies." Mistrust or fear of others seems to be partly caused by threat or fear of disasters.76

Is warfare in and between modern state societies explainable in much the same way that nonindustrial warfare seems to be explainable? Here the evidence is less clear. First, the relationship between natural disasters and war seems to be opposite in state societies. Perhaps because states usually have standing armies that need to be supplied, states appear less likely to fight when there are food-related disasters. Second, the realities of industrialized societies probably require an expanded conception of disasters. In the modern world, with its complex economic and political dependencies among nations, possible curtailments of other resources, such as oil, may be more important factors. However, interstate wars today are uncommon, and it is internal wars and civil wars that constitute most of the present armed conflict. While disasters might not clearly be related to war in state societies, recent research suggests that civil wars are predicted by the per capita income of the countryâ€”all of the wars today are in poorer regions. Conversely, in rich nations, prosperity appears to make war unattractive.77

Threat of disasters and poverty both indicate that people face risks to their livelihoods. War is one way to try to obtain resources, but the costs are enormous. But we may be coming to realize (since the end of the Cold War) that war is not the only way to ensure access to resources. There may be a better way in the modern world, a way that is more cost-effective as well as more preserving of human life. The international community, governments and NGOs, has already shown commitment to intervening in the face of disasters. Assurance of disaster relief worldwide might reduce the fear of disasters. But far more important than responding to disasters that have already occurred is to reduce the vulnerability of populations to disasters in the first place by reducing poverty. With respect to poverty, the United Nations has declared a commitment to reducing world poverty by half by 2015 in its Millenium Development Goals statement. If poverty is also a condition

making civil war more likely, reduction in such wars should also be more likely. The certainty of international cooperation could compensate for the uncertainty of resources.

Consider how Germany and Japan have fared in the years since their "unconditional surrender" in World War II. They were forbidden to participate in the international arms race and could rely on others, particularly the United States, to protect them. Without a huge burden

# **Current Research and Issues**

#### **Ethnic Conflicts: Ancient Hatreds or Not?**

n the period after World War II, ethnic conflicts appeared to rise dramatically and reached a peak in the early 1990s. Violent conflicts erupted between ethnic groups in the former Yugoslavia, Russia, and Spain (in Europe), in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and the Sudan (in Africa), and in Sri Lanka and Indonesia (in Asia)â€”to name just a few of the many instances. Such conflicts are often thought to be intractable and inevitable because they are supposedly based on ancient hatreds. But is that true?

Social scientists are a long way from understanding the conditions that predict ethnic conflicts, but they do know that ethnic conflicts are not necessarily ancient or inevitable. For example, anthropologists who did fieldwork in the former Yugoslavia in the 1980s described villages where different ethnic groups had lived side by side for a long time without apparent difficulty. The differences between them were hardly emphasized. Mary Kay Gilliland worked in a midsize town (Slavonski Brod) in the Slavonian region of Croatia, which was part of Yugoslavia. The people in the town identified themselves as from Slavonia rather than as Croats, Serbs, Hungarians, Czechs, Muslims (from Bosnia or from Albania), or Roma (Gypsies). Mixed marriages were not uncommon, and people discussed differences in background without anger. But in 1991, when Gilliland returned to Croatia, people complained about Serb domination of the Yugoslav government and there was talk of Croatia seceding. Symbols of Croat nationalism had appearedâ€”new place names, a new flagâ€”and Croats were now said to speak Croatian rather than the language they shared with the Serbs (Serbo-Croatian or Croato-Serbian). Later in 1991, violence broke out between Serbs and Croats, and atrocities were committed on both sides. Ethnicity became

Estimates are that up to 180,000 people were killed when Saddam Hussein's troops began a military campaign against Iraq's minority Kurds in 1988.

a matter of life or death, and Croatia seceded from Yugoslavia. At the same time, Tone Bringa, a Norwegian anthropologist who worked in Bosnia (which was then still a region of Yugoslavia), reported that the people there also paid little attention to ethnicity. A few years later, however, ethnic violence erupted among Bosnian Serbs, Muslims, and Croats, and only the intervention of the United Nations established a precarious peace.

Ethnic differences do not always lead to violence. Most of the time, even when ethnic aroups have faced discrimination, people of different ethnic backgrounds live in peace with each other. So the basic question is why do some places with ethnic differences erupt in violence, but not all? Why do different ethnic groups get along in some places?

We need more research to answer this question. With all of the forced and voluntary immigration in the world, many countries are becoming

more multiethnic or multicultural. The possibility of ethnic violence has become a global social problem. Gilliland suggests, among other things, that discontent over economic and political power (inequitable access to resources and opportunities) drove the Croatians to violence and secession. Does this predict ethnic violence more generally? Some cross-national studies have tested this and other theories. but so far there are no clear answers. A lot more is known about what doesn't predict ethnic violence than what does. For example, the degree of political repression does not predict ethnic conflict generally, nor does degree of intergroup hatred, income inequality, or colonial history. If we knew which factors generally give rise to ethnic violence, we might be able to think of ways to reduce or eliminate the causal conditions.

Sources: Gilliland 1995; Bringa 1995; M. H. Ross 2009a; J. Goldstein 2011. of armaments, Germany and Japan thrived. But countries that competed militarily, particularly the United States and the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War, experienced economic difficulties. Doesn't that scenario at least suggest the wisdom of international cooperation, particularly the need for international agreements to ensure worldwide disaster relief? Compared with going to war and its enormous costs, going to peace would be a bargain!

Recent research in political science and anthropology suggests an additional way to reduce the risk of war. Among the societies known to anthropology, studies indicate that people in more participatoryâ€”that is, more "democratic"â€”political systems rarely go to war with each other.78 Thus, if authoritarian governments were to disappear from the world because the powerful nations of the world stopped supporting them militarily and otherwise, the world could be more peaceful for this reason too.

Although democratically governed states rarely go to war with each other, it used to be thought that they are not necessarily more peaceful in general, that they are as likely to go to war as are other kinds of political systems, but not so much with each other. For example, the United States has gone to war with Grenada, Panama, and Iraqâ€”all authoritarian statesâ€”but not with democratic Canada, with which the United States has also had disputes. But now a consensus is emerging among political scientists that democracies are not only unlikely to go to war with each other, they are also less warlike in general.79 The theory suggested by the cross-national and cross-cultural results is that democratic conflict resolution within a political system generalizes to democratic conflict resolution between political systems, particularly if the systems are both democratic. If our participatory institutions and perceptions allow us to resolve our disputes peacefully, internally and externally, we may think that similarly governed people would also be disposed to settle things peacefully. Therefore, disputes between participatory political systems should be unlikely to result in war.

The understanding that participatory systems rarely fight each other, and knowing why they do not, would have important consequences for policy in the contemporary world. The kinds of military preparations believed necessary and the costs people would be willing to pay for them might be affected. On the one hand, understanding the relationship between democracy and peace might encourage war making against authoritarian regimes to overturn themâ€”with enormous costs in human life and otherwise. On the other hand, understanding the consequences of democracy might encourage us to assist the emergence and consolidation of more participatory systems of government in the countries of Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and elsewhere. In any case, the relationship between democracy and peace strongly suggests that it is counterproductive to support any undemocratic regimes, even if they happen to be enemies of our enemies, if we want to minimize the risk of war in the world. The latest cross-national evidence suggests that extending democracy around the world will in the long run minimize the risk of war. However, change in political systems is not easy or simple. In fact, societies transitioning to democracy are more prone to ethnic conflict and civil war. It is between stable or mature democracies that you find the lowest likelihood of war.80 Encouraging nations to be more interdependent economically, and encouraging the spread of international nongovernmental organizations (like professional societies and trade associations) to provide informal ways to resolve conflicts, would also minimize the risk of war, judging by results of recent research by political scientists.81

27.6 Describe the difficulty of defining terrorism and discuss what is known about the factors associated with it.

# Terrorism

Ever since September 11, 2001, when terrorists crashed airliners into the World Trade Center towers in New York City and into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, people all over the world realize that terrorism has become a social problem globally. It is now painfully clear that organized groups of terrorists can train their people to kill themselves and thousands of others half a world away, not only by hijacking airliners and flying them into skyscrapers but also by using easily transported explosives and biological weapons. Social scientists are now actively trying to understand terrorism, in the hope that research may lead to ways to minimize the likelihood of future attacks. But there are lots of questions to answer. What is *terrorism*, and how shall it be defined? How long has terrorist activity been around? What are the causes of terrorism? What kinds of people are likely to become terrorists? And what are the consequences of terrorism?

Answering these questions is not so simple. Most people can point to instances that hardly anyone would have trouble calling terrorismâ€”spraying nerve gas in a Japanese subway, Palestinian suicide bombers targeting Israeli civilians, Ku Klux Klan members lynching African Americans.82 It is harder to identify the boundaries among terrorism, crime, political repression, and warfare.83 Most researchers agree that terrorism involves the threat or use of violence against civilians. Terrorism is usually also politically or socially organized, in contrast to most crimes, which are usually perpetrated by individuals acting on their own. (To be sure, crime can be socially organized too, as, for example, in what we call "organized crime.") One marker of the difference between most crime and terrorism is that criminals rarely take public credit for their activities because they want to avoid being caught. In terrorism, the perpetrators usually proclaim their responsibility. In terrorism also, the violence is directed mostly at unarmed people, including women and children. It is intended to frighten the "enemy," to *terrorize* them, to scare them into doing something that the terrorists want to see happen. Generally, then, **terrorism** may be defined as the use or threat of violence to create terror in others, usually for political purposes.84 Some define terrorism as perpetrated by groups that are not formal political entities. However, this criterion presents some difficulty. What are we to call it when governments support death squads and genocide against their own civilians? Some scholars call this "state terror."85 And what are we to call the activities of some governments that support secret operations against other countries (often referred to as "state-sponsored terrorism")? Finally, although some nations conducting war explicitly try to avoid civilian casualties and focus primarily on combatants (armed soldiers), their weapons, and resources or "assets" such as factories, air strips, and fuel depots, many attacks in wartime throughout history have purposefully targeted civilians (e.g., the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to persuade the Japanese to end World War II).

One thing is certain about terrorism: It is not a new development. Some of the words we use for terroristsâ€”for example, "zealots" and "assassins"â€”derive from terrorist movements in the past. The Zealots, Jewish nationalists who revolted against the Romans occupying Judea in the first century, would hide in crowds and stab officials and priests as well as soldiers. In the 11th and 12th centuries in southwest Asia, the Fedayeen (a group of Muslim Isma'ili Shi'ites) undertook to assassinate Sunni rulers despite the almost certainty of their own capture or death. The rulers said that the Fedayeen were under the influence of hashish and called them "Hashshashin," which is the root of the later term *assassin*. 86 In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the "reign of terror" occurred during and after the French Revolution.

**Terrorism** The use or threat of violence to create terror in others, usually for political purposes.

In the early and middle 20th century, the dictator Joseph Stalin ordered the execution of many millions of people who were considered enemies of the Soviet state. Six million Jews and millions of other innocents were exterminated by the German Third Reich in the 1930s and 1940s.87 And many Latin American regimes, such as that in Argentina, terrorized and killed dissidents in the 1970s and 1980s.88 Now there is a heightened fear of terrorists who may have access to weapons of mass destruction. In a world made smaller by global transportation, cell phones, and the Internet, terrorism is a greater threat than ever before.

We still lack much systematic research that explains why terrorism occurs and why people are motivated to become terrorists. But there is a good deal of research about state terrorism. Political scientist R. J. Rummel estimates that governments have killed nearly 262 million people in the 20th century (he calls this kind of terrorism "democide"). State terrorism has been responsible for four times more deaths than all the wars, civil and international, that occurred in the 20th century. Regimes in the Soviet Union (1917â€“1987), China (1923â€“1987), and Germany (1933â€“1945) were responsible for killing more than a total of 190 million civilians. Proportionately, the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia topped them all, killing over 30 percent of its population from 1975 to 1978.89 What predicts state terrorism against one's own people? Rummel finds one clear predictorâ€”totalitarian governments. By far, they have the highest frequencies of domestic state terrorism, controlling for factors such as economic wealth, type of religion, and population size. As Rummel puts it, "power kills; absolute power kills absolutely."90 Democratic countries are less likely to practice state terrorism, but when they do, it occurs during or after a rebellion or a war.91 If state terrorism is more likely to occur in totalitarian regimes, terrorists and terrorist groups may be more likely to occur in such societies. If so, the spread of democracy may be our best hope of minimizing the risk of terrorism in the world, just as the spread of democracy seems to minimize the likelihood of war between countries.

We know relatively little so far about what predicts who will become a terrorist. We do know that terrorists often come from higher social statuses and generally have more education than the average person.92 But while terrorists are not commonly poor, it is important to ask whether the societies in which terrorism thrives are deprived in some way. A suggestive piece of evidence is that if we focus on the most deadly terrorist organizations, they do tend to occur in countries that are lower in measures of human development, that have poor records of political rights and civil liberties, and that have higher concentrations of young people.93

27.7 Discuss some lessons learned from anthropology that could make the world a better place.

# Making the World Better

Many social problems afflict our world, not just the ones discussed in this chapter and elsewhere in this book.94 But we have tried in this chapter to encourage positive thinking about global social problems; we have suggested how the results of past and future scientific research could be applied to solving some of those problems.

We may know enough now that we can do something about our problems, and we will discover more through future research. Social problems are mostly of human making and are, therefore, susceptible to human unmaking. There may be obstacles on the road to solutions, but we can overcome them if we want to. So let's go for it!

# Summary and Review

#### Natural Disasters and Famine

27.1 Explain how cultural, economic, and social factors can cause or exacerbate natural events and cause disasters and famine.

- â€¢ Climatic and other events in the physical environment become worse disasters because of events or conditions in the social environment. Therefore, disasters are also social problems, which have social causes and possible social solutions.
- â€¢ Famine almost always has some social causes and is determined by who has rights to the available food

and whether those who have more food distribute it to those who have less.

â€¢ Cross-cultural research suggests that societies with individual rather than shared property rights are more likely to suffer famine.

> What are some examples of how cultural, economic, and social factors cause or exacerbate natural disasters? What might be some solutions?

#### Inadequate Housing and Homelessness

27.2 Describe the factors that lead to inadequate housing and homelessness.

- â€¢ In 2010, half of the people in the world lived in urban areas, and it is projected to be about 70 percent by 2050.
- â€¢ As of 2012, approximately 1 billion people or about 33 percent of urban dwellers lived in slums. Four in ten of nonpermanent houses in slums were in high-risk areas such as flood zones or areas prone to landslides.
- â€¢ All but the upper-income elite may be found in illegal settlements. Squatter settlements are not chaotic, unorganized, or full of crime. Most dwellers cannot find affordable housing, but they are employed, aspire to get ahead, live in intact nuclear families, and help each other.
- â€¢ Research suggests differences in the causes of homelessness in different parts of the world. Social and political policies cause homelessness.
- â€¢ Many countries have "street children." In the late 1980s, 80 million of the world's children lived in the streets. In the 2000s, the estimated number grew to about 150 million worldwide.

What factors lead to inadequate housing and homelessness and what may help minimize these conditions?

## Family Violence and Abuse

27.3 Discuss the magnitude, causes, and consequences of family violence.

- â€¢ To avoid having to decide what is or is not abuse, many researchers focus their studies on variation in the frequencies of specific behaviors, for example, which societies have physical punishment of children.
- â€¢ Much of the violence directed at children is believed to be morally correct by the people practicing it.

- â€¢ Children who are corporally punished are more likely to later physically assault their dating partners or spouses, be convicted of a crime, and have depression. Corporal punishment is possibly a cradle of violence.
- â€¢ Two main predictors of corporal punishment in the cross-cultural record that are practically universal in the nation-states of the world are a money economy and a stratified social system.
- â€¢ Wife beating occurs in 85 percent of the world's societies; it is most common when men control family labor and have the final say in the home, when divorce is difficult for women, when a husband's kin control remarriage for a widow, or when women have no female work groups.

What are some of the causes and consequences of family violence? What might be done to minimize it?

## Crime

27.4 Explain how cultural and societal features relate to crime, especially in regard to homicide.

- â€¢ What is a crime in one society is not necessarily a crime in another. Researchers tend to look at homicide rates to assess variability among societies in terms of crime.
- â€¢ Whether a nation is defeated or victorious, homicide rates tend to increase after a war.
- â€¢ More countries show murder rates going down rather than up after capital punishment was abolished.
- â€¢ Homicide is usually highest in nations or societies with high poverty and income inequality.

What are some of the conditions that increase the likelihood of crime? What might decrease it?

#### War

27.5 Discuss warfare in terms of cultural, social, and ecological factors, and describe the reasons societies go to war.

- â€¢ Armed conflict appears to be greater in periods of worsening climate and more frequent climate-related natural events associated with disasters.
- â€¢ Teaching children to mistrust others may be another factor predicting war. People who grow up to be

mistrustful may be more likely to go to war than to negotiate or seek conciliation. Mistrust or fear of others seems to be partly caused by threat or fear of disasters.

â€¢ Interstate wars today are uncommon; internal wars and civil wars constitute most of the present armed conflict. Recent research suggests that civil wars are predicted by the per capita income of the country all of the wars today are in poorer regions.

What are some of the predictors of more warfare? What might minimize warfare?

### Terrorism

27.6 Describe the difficulty of defining terrorism and discuss what is known about the factors associated with it.

- â€¢ One marker of the difference between most crime and terrorism is that criminals rarely take public credit for their activities because they do not want to be caught. Terrorist perpetrators usually proclaim their responsibility.
- â€¢ Terrorist violence is directed mostly at unarmed people, including women and children. It is intended to frighten the "enemy," to scare them into doing something that the terrorists want to see happen.
- â€¢ Terrorism is not a new development and goes back to at least the first century. Today, there is a heightened fear of terrorists who may have access to weapons of mass destruction.
- â€¢ More research has been done on state terrorism than on terrorism. State terrorism has resulted in four

times more deaths than all the wars, civil and international, that occurred in the 20th century. A clear predictor of state terrorism is the presence of a totalitarian government.

â€¢ Terrorists generally come from higher statuses and have higher levels of education. Terrorist organizations tend to arise in countries that have lower measures of human development, poor records of political rights and civil liberties, and higher concentrations of young people.

What are the difficulties in defining terrorism? What may explain state terrorism?

# Making the World Better

27.7 Discuss some lessons learned from anthropology that could make the world a better place.

- â€¢ Social problems such as disasters, famine, inadequate housing, homelessness, family violence, crime, war, and terrorism can be studied, and the research findings can be applied to improve or resolve those problems.
- â€¢ Factors that create social problems are not always obvious, so it is important to look carefully at beliefs and practices within and among cultures to better understand the dynamics of these problems.
