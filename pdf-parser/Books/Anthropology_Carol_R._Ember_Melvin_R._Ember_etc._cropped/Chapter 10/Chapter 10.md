### 10 chapter Origins of Food Production and Settled Life

![](_page_0_Picture_1.jpeg)

loward the end of the period known as the Upper Paleolithic, people seem to have obtained most of their food from hunting migratory herds of large animals, such as wild cattle, antelope, bison, and mammoths. These hunter-gatherers were probably highly mobile to follow the migrations of the animals. Beginning about 14,000 years ago, people in some regions began to depend less on big game hunting and more on relatively stationary food resources, such as fish, shellfish, small game, and wild plants (see Figure 10.1). In some areas, particularly Europe and the Near East, the exploitation of local, relatively permanent resources may account for an increasingly settled way of life. The cultural period in which these developments took place is usually now called the Epipa**leolithic** in the Near East and the **Mesolithic** in Europe. Other areas of the world show a similar switch to what is called *broad-spectrum* food-collecting, but they do not always show an increasingly settled lifestyle, as, for example, in Mesoamerica, where this period is called the Archaic.

We see the first clear evidence of a changeover to **food production**—the cultivation and domestication of plants and animals—in the Near East, about 8000 B.C.<sup>1</sup> This shift, called the *Neolithic revolution* by archaeologist V. Gordon Childe, occurred, probably independently, in other areas of the Old and New Worlds within the next few thousand years. In the Old World, there were independent centers of domestication in China, Southeast Asia (what is now Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and New Guinea), and Africa around 6000 B.C.<sup>2</sup> In the New World, there were centers of cultivation and domestication in the highlands of Mesoamerica (about 7000 B.C.), the central Andes around Peru (about 7000 B.C.), and the Eastern Woodlands of North America (about 2000 B.C., but perhaps earlier).<sup>3</sup> Most of the world's major food plants and animals were domesticated well before 2000 B.C. Also developed by that time were techniques of plowing,

logical period in the Old World beginning about 12,000 B.C. Humans were starting to settle down in semipermanent camps and villages, as people began to depend less on big game (which they used to have to follow over long distances) and more on relatively stationary food resources such as fish, shellfish, small game, and wild plants rich in carbohydrates, proteins, and oils.

fertilizing, fallowing, and irrigation.4 Figure 10.2 shows the regions of the world that domesticated today's main food crops.

In this chapter, we discuss what is believed about the origins of food production and settled life, called **sedentarism**—how and why people in different places may have come to cultivate and domesticate plants and animals and to live in permanent villages. **Agriculture** (which we use here to refer to all types of domestic plant cultivation) and a sedentary life did not necessarily develop together. In some regions of the world, people began to live in permanent villages before they cultivated and domesticated plants and animals, whereas people in other places planted crops without settling down permanently.

#### 10.1 Explain the relationship between broad-spectrum collecting, sedentarism, and population growth in terms of preagricultural developments.

# Preagricultural Developments

Much of our discussion here focuses on the Near East and Mesoamerica, the areas we know best archaeologically for the developments leading to food production and settled life. As much as we can, however, we try to indicate how data from other areas appear to suggest patterns different from, or similar to, those in the Near East and Mesoamerica.

### The Near East

In the Near East, there seems to have been a shift from mobile big game hunting to the utilization of a broad spectrum of natural resources at the end of the Upper Paleolithic.5 There is evidence that people subsisted on a variety of resources, including fish, mollusks, and other water life; wild deer, sheep, and goats; and wild grains, nuts, and legumes.6 The increased utilization of stationary food sources such as wild grain may partly explain why some people in the Near East began to lead more sedentary lives during the Epipaleolithic.

#### **Sedentarism** Settled life.

**Agriculture** The practice of raising domesticated crops.

Even today, a traveler passing through the Anatolian highlands of Turkey and other mountainous regions in the Near East may see thick stands of wild wheat and barley growing as densely as if they had been cultivated.7 Wielding flint sickles, Epipaleolithic people could easily have harvested a bountiful crop from such wild stands. Just how productive these resources can be was demonstrated in a field experiment duplicating prehistoric conditions. Using the kind of flint-blade sickle an Epipaleolithic worker would have used, researchers were able to harvest a little over two pounds of wild grain in an hour. A family of four, working only during the few weeks of the harvest season, probably could have reaped more wheat and barley than they needed for the entire year.<sup>8</sup>

The amount of wild wheat harvested in the experiment prompted Kent Flannery to conclude, "Such a harvest would almost necessitate some degree of sedentism—after all, where could they go with an estimated metric ton of clean wheat?"9 Moreover, the stone equipment used for grinding would have been a clumsy burden to carry. Part of the harvest would probably have been set aside for immediate consumption, ground, and then cooked by either roasting or boiling. The rest of the harvest would have been stored to supply food for the remainder of the year. A grain diet, then, could have been the impetus for the construction of roasters, grinders, and storage pits by some preagricultural people, as well as for the construction of solid, fairly permanent housing. Once a village was built, people may have been reluctant to abandon it. We can visualize the earliest preagricultural settlements clustered around such naturally rich regions, as archaeological evidence indeed suggests they were.

The Natufians of the Near East Eleven thousand years ago, the Natufians, a people living in the area that is now Israel and Jordan, inhabited caves and rock shelters and built villages on the slopes of Mount Carmel in Israel. At the front of their rock shelters, they hollowed out basin-shaped depressions in the rock, possibly for storage pits. Examples of Natufian villages are also found at the Eynan site in Israel.

![](_page_3_Picture_4.jpeg)

Eynan is a stratified site containing the remains of three villages in sequence, one atop another. Each village consisted of about 50 circular *pit houses.* The floor of each house was sunk a few feet into the ground so that the walls of the house consisted partly of earth, below ground level, and partly of stone, above ground level. Pit houses had the advantage of retaining heat longer than houses built above the ground. The villages appear to have had stone-paved walks and circular stone pavements ringed with what seem to be permanent hearths, and the dead were interred in village cemeteries.

The tools suggest that the Natufians harvested wild grain intensively. Sickles recovered from their villages have a specific sheen that experiments have shown to be the effect of flint striking grass stems, as the sickles would have been used in the cutting of grain. The Natufians are the earliest Epipaleolithic people known to have stored surplus crops. Beneath the floors of their stone-walled houses, they constructed plastered storage pits. In addition to wild grains, the Natufians exploited a wide range of other resources.10 The remains of many wild animals are found in Natufian sites; Natufians appear to have concentrated on hunting gazelle, which they would take by surrounding whole herds.<sup>11</sup>

The Natufians, as well as foragers in other areas at the time, show many differences as compared with foragers in earlier periods.12 Not only was Natufian foraging based on a more intensive use of stationary resources such as wild grain, but the archaeological evidence suggests increasing social complexity. Natufian sites on the average were five times larger than those of their predecessors. Communities were occupied for most of the year, if not year-round. Burial patterns suggest more social differences between people. Although the available wild cereal resources appear to have enabled the Natufians to live in relatively permanent villages, their diet seems to have suffered. Their tooth enamel shows signs of nutritional deficiency, and their stature declined over time.13

### Mesoamerica

A similar shift toward more broad-spectrum hunting and gathering occurred in the New World at the end of the Paleo-Indian period, about 10,000 years ago. Climate change seems to have been vital here too, as it was in the Old World. The retreat of glacial ice from North America and overall warmer and wetter climate brought dramatic changes to plant and animal communities throughout North America and Mesoamerica. Pleistocene megafauna, such as mammoth, mastodon, rhinoceros, giant ground sloth, and others, as well as a variety of smaller game animals, such as the horse, all went extinct in a relatively short period of time.14 Hunting strategies shifted toward a broader range of game species, particularly deer, antelope, bison, and small mammals. At the same time, deciduous woodlands and grasslands expanded, providing a range of new plants to exploit. Ground stone woodworking tools such as axes and adzes first appeared, as did nut-processing tools such as mortars and pestles. Shellfish began to be exploited in some areas. Throughout North America and Mesoamerica, people began to expand the range of plants and animals they relied upon.15

The Archaic Peoples of Highland Mesoamerica In Highland Mesoamerica, the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico, we also see a shift from big game hunting to a broader use of resources, in part due to a change in climate to be more like today's. Altitude became an important factor in the hunting and collecting regime, as different altitudes have different plant and animal resources. Valleys tend to have scrubby, grassland vegetation, whereas foothills and mountains have "thorn forests" of cactuses and succulents, giving way to oak and pine forests at higher altitudes, where there is more moisture. This vertical zonation means that a wide range of plants and animals were available in relatively close proximity—different environments were close by—and the Archaic peoples took advantage of these varied conditions to hunt and collect a broad range of resources.16

About 8,000 years ago, the Archaic peoples in Mesoamerica appear to have moved seasonally between communities of two different sizes: camps with 15 to 30 residents (*macrobands*) and camps with only 2 to 5 residents (*microbands*). Macroband camps were located near seasonally abundant resources, such as acorns or mesquite pods. Several

families would have come together when these resources were in season, both to take advantage of them and to work together to harvest them while they were plentiful, perhaps to perform rituals, and simply to socialize. Microband camps were also inhabited seasonally, probably by a single family, when groups were not assembled into macroband camps. Remains of these microband camps are often found in caves or rock shelters from which a variety of environments could be exploited by moving either upslope or downslope from the campsite.17

Unlike the Natufians of the Near East, there is no evidence of social differences among the Archaic peoples of Highland Mesoamerica. The largest social unit, the macroband camp, was probably composed of related family groups, and leadership in these groups was probably informal. There is little evidence of ritual behavior beyond the presence of what may have been a ceremonial dance floor at Gheo-Shih, a macroband campsite in the Valley of Oaxaca. In short, lifestyles remained much like the simple and egalitarian ones of the Paleo-Indians despite the transition to a much broader strategy of foraging.

### Other Areas

People in other areas of the world also shifted from hunting big game to collecting many types of food before they began to practice agriculture. The still-sparse archaeological record suggests that such a change occurred in Southeast Asia, which may have been one of the important centers of original plant and animal domestication.18 The faunal remains in inland sites there indicate that many different sources of food were being exploited from the same base camps. For example, at these base camps, we find the remains of animals from high mountain ridges as well as lowland river valleys, birds and primates from nearby forests, bats from caves, and fish from streams. The few coastal sites indicate that many kinds of fish and shellfish were collected and that animals such as deer, wild cattle, and rhinoceros were hunted.19 The preagricultural developments in Southeast Asia probably were responses to changes in the climate and environment, including a warming trend, more moisture, and a higher sea level.20

In Africa, too, the preagricultural period was marked by a warmer, wetter environment. The now-numerous lakes, rivers, and other bodies of water provided fish, shellfish, and other resources that apparently allowed people to settle more permanently than they had before. For example, there were lakes in what is now the southern and central Sahara Desert, where people fished and hunted hippopotamus and crocodile. This pattern of broad-spectrum food-collecting seems also to have been characteristic of the areas both south and north of the Sahara.21 One area showing increased sedentarism is the Dakhleh Oasis in the Western Desert of Egypt. Between 9,000 years and 8,500 years ago, the inhabitants lived in circular stone huts on the shores of rivers and lakes. Bone harpoons and pottery are found there and in other areas from the Nile Valley through the central and southern Sahara westward to what is now Mali. Fishing seems to have allowed people to remain along the rivers and lakes for much of the year.22

### Why Did Broad-Spectrum Collecting Develop?

It is apparent that the preagricultural switch to broad-spectrum collecting was fairly common throughout the world. Climate change was probably at least partly responsible for the exploitation of new sources of food. For example, the worldwide rise in sea level because of glacial melting may have increased the availability of fish and shellfish. Changes in climate may have also been partly responsible for the decline in the availability of big game, particularly the large herd animals.23 In addition, it has been suggested that another possible cause of that decline was human activity, specifically overkilling of some of these animals.24 The evidence suggesting overkill is that the extinction in the New World of many of the large Pleistocene animals, such as the mammoth, coincided with the movement of humans from the Bering Strait region into the Americas.25

The overkill hypothesis has been questioned on the basis of bird as well as mammal extinctions in the New World. An enormous number of bird species also became extinct during the last few thousand years of the North American Pleistocene, and it is difficult to

![](_page_6_Picture_1.jpeg)

argue that human hunters caused all of those extinctions. Because the bird and mammal extinctions occurred simultaneously, it is likely that most or nearly all the extinctions were due to climatic and other environmental changes.26 Then again, the example of the New Zealand moas, which went extinct soon after humans colonized the islands, may be instructive. Moas had low reproductive rates; computer simulations suggest their population would have been very sensitive to increases in adult mortality. Because many large animals have low reproductive rates like moas, human overhunting may have been responsible for their extinction.<sup>27</sup>

The decreasing availability of big game may have stimulated people to exploit new food resources. But they may have turned to a broader spectrum of resources for another reason—population growth (see Figure 10.3). As Mark Cohen has noted, hunter-gatherers were "filling up" the world, and they may have had to seek new, possibly less desirable sources of food.28 (We might think of shellfish as more desirable than mammoths but only because we don't have to do the work to get such food. A lot of shellfish have to be collected, shelled, and cooked to produce the amount of animal protein obtainable from one large animal.)

Broad-spectrum collecting may have involved exploitation of new sources of food, but that does not necessarily mean that people were eating better. A decline in stature often indicates a poorer diet. During the preagricultural period, height apparently declined by as much as two inches in many parts of the Old World (Greece, Israel, India, and northern and western Europe).29 This decline may have been a result of decreasing nutrition, but it could also be that natural selection for greater height was relaxed because leverage for throwing projectiles such as spears was not so favored after the decline of big game hunting. (Greater limb-bone length, and therefore greater height, would enable a hunter to throw a spear with more force and farther.30) In other areas of the world, such as Australia and what is now the midwestern United States, skeletal evidence also suggests a decline in the general level of health with the rise of broad-spectrum collecting.31

### Broad-Spectrum Collecting and Sedentarism

Does the switch to broad-spectrum collecting explain the increasingly sedentary way of life we see in various parts of the world in preagricultural times? The answer seems to be both yes and no. In some areas of the world—some sites in Europe, the Near East, Africa, and Peru—settlements became more permanent. In other areas, such as the semiarid highlands of Mesoamerica, the switch to broad-spectrum collecting was not associated with increasing sedentarism. Even after the Highland Mesoamericans began to cultivate plants, they still did not live in permanent villages.32 Why?

It would seem that it is not simply the switch to broad-spectrum collecting that accounts for increasing sedentarism in many areas. Rather, a comparison of settlements on the Peruvian coast suggests that the more permanent settlements were located nearer, within three and a half miles, to most, if not all, of the diverse food resources exploited during the year. The community that did not have a year-round settlement seems to have depended on more widely distributed resources. What accounts for sedentarism may thus be the nearness33 or the high reliability and yield34 of the broad-spectrum resources rather than the broad spectrum itself.

### Sedentarism and Population Growth

Although some population growth undoubtedly occurred throughout the hunting and gathering phase of world history, some anthropologists have suggested that populations would have increased dramatically when people began to settle down. The evidence for this suggestion comes largely from a comparison of recent nomadic and sedentary !Kung populations.

The settling down of a nomadic group may reduce the typical spacing between births.35 Nomadic !Kung have children spaced four years apart on the average; in contrast, recently sedentarized !Kung have children about three years apart. Why might birth spacing change with settling down? There are several possibilities.

The spacing of children far apart can occur in a number of ways. One way, if effective contraceptives are not available, is prolonged sexual abstinence after the birth of a child the postpartum sex taboo—which is common in recent human societies. Another way is abortion or infanticide.36 Nomadic groups may be motivated to have children farther apart because of the problem of carrying small children. Carrying one small child is difficult enough; carrying two might be too burdensome. Thus, sedentary populations could have their children spaced more closely because carrying children would not always be necessary.

Although some nomadic groups may have deliberately spaced births by abstinence or infanticide, there is no evidence that such practices explain why four years separate births among nomadic !Kung. There may be another explanation, involving an unintended effect of how babies are fed. Nancy Howell and Richard Lee have suggested that the presence of baby foods other than mother's milk may be responsible for the decreased birth spacing in sedentary agricultural !Kung groups.37 It is now well established that the longer a mother nurses her baby without supplementary foods, the longer it is likely to be before she starts ovulating again. Nomadic !Kung women have little to give their babies in the way of soft, digestible food, and the babies depend largely on mother's milk for two to three years. But sedentary !Kung mothers can give their babies soft foods such as cereal (made from cultivated grain) and milk from domesticated animals. Such changes in feeding practices may shorten birth spacing by shortening the interval between birth and the resumption of ovulation. In preagricultural sedentary communities, it is possible that baby foods made from wild grains might have had the same effect. For this reason alone, therefore, populations may have grown even before people started to farm or herd.

Another reason sedentary !Kung women may have more babies than nomadic !Kung women has to do with the ratio of body fat to body weight. Some investigators suspect that a critical minimum of fat in the body may be necessary for ovulation. A sedentary !Kung woman may have more fatty tissue than a nomadic !Kung woman, who walks many miles daily to gather wild plant foods, often carrying a child with her. Thus, sedentary !Kung women might resume ovulating sooner after the birth of a baby and so for that

reason alone may be likely to have more closely spaced children. If some critical amount of fat is necessary for ovulation, that would explain why many women who have little body fat in our own society—long-distance runners, gymnasts, and ballet dancers are examples—do not ovulate regularly.38

### Microlithic Technology

Technologically, these preagricultural cultures did not differ radically from Upper Paleolithic cultures.39 However, the trend toward smaller and lighter tools continued. Microliths, small blades half an inch to two inches long, which were made in late Upper Paleolithic times, were now used in quantity. In place of the one-piece flint implement, the preagricultural peoples in Europe, Asia, and Africa equipped themselves with *composite* tools—that is, tools made of more than one material.

Microliths, too small to be used one at a time, could be fitted into grooves in bone or wood to form arrows, harpoons, daggers, and sickles. A sickle, for example, was made by inserting several microliths into a groove in a wooden or bone handle. Resin held the blades in place. A broken microlith could be replaced like a blade in a modern razor. Besides being adaptable for many uses, microliths could be made from many varieties of available stone. Because they did not need the large nodules to make large core and flake tools, people using microliths could work with smaller nodules to make the small blades.<sup>40</sup>

# The Domestication of Plants and Animals

*Neolithic* means "of the new stone age"; the term originally signified the cultural stage in which humans invented pottery and ground-stone tools. We now know, however, that both were present in earlier times, so now archaeologists generally define the **Neolithic** in terms of the presence of domesticated plants and animals. In this type of culture, people began to produce food rather than merely collect it.

The line between food collecting and food producing occurs when people begin to plant crops and to keep and breed animals. How do we know when this transition occurred? In fact, archaeologically we do not see the beginning of food production; we can see signs of it only after plants and animals show differences from their wild varieties.

When people plant crops, we refer to the process as cultivation. It is only when the crops cultivated and the animals raised are *modified*—different from wild varieties—that we speak of plant and animal **domestication**.

We know, in a particular site, that domestication occurred if plant remains have characteristics different from those of wild plants of the same types (see Figure 10.4). For example, wild grains of barley and wheat have a fragile **rachis**—the seed-bearing part of the stem—which shatters easily, releasing the seeds. Domesticated grains have a tough rachis, which does not shatter easily. In addition, the grain of wild barley and wheat has a tough shell protecting the seed from premature exposure, whereas domesticated grain has a brittle shell that can be easily separated, which facilitates preparing the seed for grinding into flour.

How did the domesticated plants get to be different from the wild varieties? Artificial or human selection, deliberate or accidental, obviously was required. Consider how the rachis of wheat and barley may have changed. As we said, when wild grain ripens in the field, the rachis shatters easily, scattering the seed. This trait is selectively advantageous under wild conditions; it is nature's method of propagating the species. Plants with a tough rachis, therefore, have only

It is only when the crops cultivated and the animals raised have been modified—are different from wild varieties—that we speak of plant and animal domestication.

a slight chance of reproducing themselves under natural conditions, but they are more desirable for planting. When humans arrived with sickles and flails to collect the wild stands of grain, the seeds harvested probably contained a high proportion of tough-rachis mutants because these could best withstand the rough treatment of harvest processing. If planted, the harvested seeds would be likely to produce tough-rachis plants. If, in each successive harvest, seeds from tough-rachis plants were the least likely to be lost, toughrachis plants would come to predominate.<sup>41</sup>

Domesticated species of animals also differ from the wild varieties. For example, the horns of wild goats in the Near East are shaped differently from those of domesticated  $\text{goats.}^{42}$  But differences in physical characteristics may not be the only indicators of domestication. Some archaeologists believe that imbalances in the sex and age ratios of animal remains at particular sites also suggest that domestication had occurred. For example, at Zawi Chemi Shanidar in Iraq, the proportion of young to mature sheep remains was much higher than the ratio of young to mature sheep in wild herds. One possible inference to be drawn is that the animals were domesticated, the adult sheep being saved for breeding purposes whereas the young were eaten. (If mostly young animals were eaten, and only a few animals were allowed to grow old, most of the bones found in a site would be from the young animals that were killed regularly for food. $^{43}$ 

#### **Domestication in the Near East**

For some time, most archaeologists have thought that the Fertile Crescent (see Figure 10.5), the arc of land stretching up from Israel and the Jordan Valley through southern Turkey and then downward to the western slopes of the Zagros Mountains in Iran, was one of the

![](_page_10_Figure_7.jpeg)

![](_page_10_Figure_8.jpeg)

Modern cities are represented by a dot, early settlements by a square. The yellow color indicates the area known as the Fertile Crescent

earliest centers of plant and animal domestication. We know that several varieties of domesticated wheat were being grown there after about 8000 b.c., as were oats, rye, barley, lentils, peas, and various fruits and nuts (apricots, pears, pomegranates, dates, figs, olives, almonds, and pistachios).44 It appears that animals were first domesticated in the Near East. Dogs were first domesticated before the rise of agriculture, around 13,000 b.c., goats, sheep, cattle, and pigs were domesticated around 7000 b.c. and perhaps even earlier.45

Let us look at two early Neolithic sites in the Near East to see what life there may have been like after people began to depend on domesticated plants and animals for food.

Ali Kosh At the stratified site of Ali Kosh in what is now southwestern Iran (see Figure 10.5), we see the remains of a community that started out about 7500 b.c., living mostly on wild plants and animals. Over the next 2,000 years, until about 5500 b.c., agriculture and herding became increasingly important. After 5500 b.c., we see the appearance of two innovations—irrigation and the use of domesticated cattle—that seem to have stimulated a minor population explosion during the following millennium.

From 7500 to 6750 b.c., the people at Ali Kosh cut little slabs of raw clay out of the ground to build small, multiroom structures. The rooms excavated by archaeologists are seldom more than 7 feet by 10 feet, and there is no evidence that the structures were definitely houses where people actually spent time or slept. Instead, they may have been storage rooms. On the other hand, house rooms of even smaller size are known in other areas of the world, so it is possible that the people at Ali Kosh in its earliest phase were actually living in those tiny, unbaked "brick" houses. There is a bit of evidence that the people at Ali Kosh may have moved for the summer (with their goats) to the grassier mountain valleys nearby, which were just a few days' walk away.

We have a lot of evidence about what the people at Ali Kosh ate. They got some of their food from cultivated emmer wheat and a kind of barley and a considerable amount from domesticated goats. We know the goats were domesticated because wild goats do not seem to have lived in the area. Also, the fact that virtually no bones from elderly goats were found in the site suggests that the goats were domesticated and herded rather than hunted. Moreover, it would seem from the horn cores found in the site that mostly young male goats were eaten, so the females probably were kept for breeding and milking. But with all these signs of deliberate food production, there is an enormous amount of evidence—literally tens of thousands of seeds and bone fragments—that the people at the beginning of Ali Kosh depended mostly on wild plants (legumes and grasses) and wild animals (including gazelles, wild oxen, and wild pigs). They also collected fish, such as carp and catfish, and shellfish, such as mussels, as well as waterfowl that visited the area during part of the year.

The flint tools used during this earliest phase at Ali Kosh were varied and abundant. Finds from this period include tens of thousands of tiny flint blades, some only a few millimeters wide. About 1 percent of the chipped stone that archaeologists found was **obsidian**, or volcanic glass, which came from what is now eastern Turkey, several hundred miles away. Thus, the people at Ali Kosh during its earliest phase definitely had some kind of contact with people elsewhere. This contact is also suggested by the fact that the emmer wheat they cultivated did not have a wild relative in the area.

From 6750 to 6000 b.c., the people increased their consumption of cultivated food plants; 40 percent of the seed remains in the hearths and refuse areas were now from emmer wheat and barley. The proportion of the diet coming from wild plants was much reduced, probably because the cultivated plants have the same growing season and grow in the same kind of soil as the wild plants. Grazing by the goats and sheep that were kept may also have contributed to the reduction of wild plant foods in the area and in the diet. The village may or may not have grown larger, but the multiroom houses definitely had. The rooms were now larger than 10 feet by 10 feet; the walls were much thicker; and a mud mortar now held the clay-slab bricks together. Also, the walls now often had a coat of smooth mud plaster on both sides. The stamped-mud house floors were apparently covered with rush or reed mats (you can see the imprints of them). There were courtyards with domed brick ovens and brick-lined roasting pits. Understandably, considering the summer heat in the area, none of the ovens found was inside a house.

**Obsidian** A volcanic glass that can be used to make mirrors or sharpedged tools.

Even though the village probably contained no more than 100 individuals, it participated in an extensive trading network. Seashells were probably obtained from the Persian Gulf, which is some distance to the south; copper may have come from what is now central Iran; obsidian was still coming from eastern Turkey; and turquoise somehow made its way from what is now the border between Iran and Afghanistan. Some of these materials were used as ornaments worn by both sexes—or so it seems from the remains of bodies found buried under the floors of houses.

After about 5500 b.c., the area around Ali Kosh began to show signs of a much larger population, apparently made possible by a more complex agriculture employing irrigation and plows drawn by domesticated cattle. In the next thousand years, by 4500 b.c., the population of the area probably tripled. This population growth was apparently part of the cultural developments that culminated in the rise of urban civilizations in the Near East.<sup>46</sup>

Population growth may have occurred in and around Ali Kosh but did not continue in all areas of the Near East after domestication. For example, one of the largest early villages in the Near East, 'Ain Ghazal (on the outskirts of what is now Amman, Jordan), suffered a decline in population and standard of living over time, perhaps because the environment around 'Ain Ghazal could not permanently support a large village.47

Catal Hüyük On a windswept plateau in the rugged, mountainous region of southern Turkey stand the remains of a mud-brick town known as Catal Hüyük. *Hüyük* is the Turkish word for a mound formed by a succession of settlements, one built on top of another.

About 5600 b.c., Catal Hüyük was an adobe town. Some 200 houses have been excavated, and they are interconnected in *pueblo fashion* (each flat-roofed structure housed a number of families). The inhabitants decorated the walls of the houses with imaginative murals and their shrines with symbolic statuary. The murals depict what seem to be religious scenes and everyday events. Archaeologists peeling away frescoes found layer upon layer of murals, indicating that old murals were plastered over to make way for fresh paintings. Several rooms are believed to have been shrine rooms. They contain many large bull murals and clay bull figurines and have full-sized clay heads of cattle on the walls. Other "shrine room" murals depict scenes of life and death, painted in red and black, respec-

tively. Clay statuettes of a pregnant woman and of a bearded man seated on a bull have also been found in these rooms.

Farming was well advanced at Catal Hüyük. Lentils, wheat, barley, and peas were grown in quantities that produced a surplus. Archaeologists were astonished at the richly varied handicrafts, including beautifully carved wooden bowls and boxes that the people of the town produced. These people also had obsidian and flint daggers, spearheads, lance heads, scrapers, awls, and sickle blades. Bowls, spatulas, knives, ladles, and spoons were made from bone. The houses contained belt hooks, toggles, and pins carved from bone. Evidence also suggests that men and women wore jewelry fashioned from bone, shell, and copper and that they used obsidian mirrors.48

town evidently depended on exchange with other areas to secure the rich variety of materials it used. Shells were procured from the Mediterranean, timber from the hills, obsidian from 50 miles away, and marble from western Turkey.

### Domestication in Mesoamerica

A very different pattern of domestication is seen in Mesoamerica. Here the seminomadic Archaic hunting and gathering lifestyle persisted long after people first domesticated plants.49 How can this be? Don't people have to settle near their crops to take care of them? Once they have domesticated plants, don't they stop collecting wild plants? The answer is no. In Mesoamerica, people sowed a variety of plants, but after doing so they went on with their seasonal rounds of hunting and gathering and came back later to harvest what they had sown. Many of the early domesticates in Mesoamerica were not basic to subsistence, even if they were highly desirable. Domestication may have been a way for Archaic peoples to make desirable plants more common in their environment. For example, one of the first domesticates was the bottle gourd. These were not eaten but were used to carry water. Joyce Marcus and Kent Flannery hypothesize that people deliberately domesticated the bottle gourd by planting them in areas where they did not grow naturally so that as groups moved through those areas, they always had access to gourds for carrying water.50

Bottle gourds are only one of many early domesticates from Highland Mesoamerica. Others include tomatoes, cotton, a variety of beans and squashes, and, perhaps most importantly, maize. The earliest domesticated form of maize (corn), dating from about 5000 b.c., has been found in Tehuacán, Mexico. Genetic studies of maize show that it was domesticated from teosinte, a tall wild grass that still grows widely in Mexico (see Figure 10.6).51 Indeed, these genetic studies suggest that changes occured in only two genes, one related to the kernel glumes (outer casing) and one related to the stalk shape.52 The genes of modern corn were already established 4,000 years to 6,000 years ago.

Figure 10.6 Teosinte Plant, Spike, and Seeds and Maize Plant, Cob, and Kernels

Note how much larger the domesticated maize cob and kernels are compared to the teosinte spike and seeds. *Source*: Feder 2000.

Teosinte is quite different from maize in several important ways, but small genetic changes led to major phenotypic changes. The genetic malleability of maize may be one reason it has become one of the most important domesticated crops on earth. Teosinte stalks do look a lot like maize, but teosinte has a "spike" to which 7 to 12 individual seeds are attached in a single row, unlike the maize cob, which has many seeds in many rows. Each teosinte seed has its own brittle shell, whereas the entire maize cob is covered with a tough husk. However, early maize was also considerably different from modern maize. The oldest maize cobs—dating to about 7,000 years ago—are tiny, only about an inch long. They have only a half-dozen rows of seeds, and each seed is tiny. One interesting fact about both ancient and modern maize is that it is almost completely dependent on humans to reproduce—the shift from seeds with brittle coats to cobs with a tough husk meant that someone had to open the husk without damaging the seeds for them to be dispersed and reproduce.53

Like maize and the bottle gourd, beans and squash were probably domesticated by simple manipulation of wild varieties. Runner beans, for example, grow naturally in the soils on the slopes outside of rock shelters and caves. It is not a stretch of the imagination to envision Archaic peoples harvesting these beans (for their roots to begin with—nondomestic runner bean seeds are tiny and probably were not eaten) and selectively planting those with desired qualities, like large seeds. Similarly, the Archaic peoples likely only ate the seeds of wild squashes, as the flesh of wild squashes often has an unattractive smell and taste. But they may have selectively planted mutants with good-tasting flesh and larger seeds, eventually producing the domestic varieties over time.54

People who lived in Mesoamerica, Mexico, and Central America are often credited with the invention of planting maize, beans, and squash together in the same field. This planting strategy provides some important advantages. Maize takes nitrogen from the soil; beans, like all legumes, put nitrogen back into the soil. The maize stalk provides a natural pole for the bean plant to twine around, and the low-growing squash can grow around the base of the tall maize plant. Beans supply people with the amino acid lysine, which is missing in maize. Thus, maize and beans together provide all the essential amino acids that humans need to obtain from their food. Teosinte may have provided the model for this unique combination, as wild runner beans and wild squash occur naturally where teosinte grows.55

Guila Naquitz The Guila Naquitz cave, excavated in the 1960s by Kent Flannery, provides a good picture of early domestication in Highland Mesoamerica. Here, small groups of people, probably only a single family at a time, lived intermittently (and probably seasonally) over a period of 2,000 years (circa 8900 b.c.–6700 b.c.), the period during which plants were domesticated. The cave itself is located in the thorn forest of the upper piedmont above the floor of the Valley of Oaxaca. The residents of Guila Naquitz hunted deer and peccary (a wild piglike animal) with spears and spear throwers, and they trapped small animals such as rabbits. They also collected plant foods from the surrounding area, particularly prickly pear fruits, cherries, acorns, and piñon nuts from the forests above the cave, along with agave hearts, onions, and various other nuts and fruits from a variety of thorn forest plants.<sup>56</sup>

Also found in the Guila Naquitz cave are the remains of domesticated plants, including bottle gourd and several varieties of squashes. How did these come to be in the cave? Were the inhabitants planting fields of squashes? Probably not in the way one thinks of planting a field today. Squashes are common wild plants in Highland Mesoamerica and thrive in disturbed soils such as those outside of caves. It may be that the inhabitants of the Guila Naquitz cave knew squashes would grow easily near their cave and so actively planted some with better-tasting flesh or larger seeds than those that might naturally grow there.57 Domestication and the use of domesticated plants would be rather informal—a supplement to a diet already rich in animal and plant species. This picture seems much different from that at Near Eastern sites such as Ali Kosh and Catal Hüyük. Domestication in Guila Naquitz appears to have been accomplished by hunters and gatherers who supplemented their basic diet with some desired plants (squashes with tasty flesh, for example); there was no "revolution" that enabled the people to rely on domesticated plants.

### Domestication Elsewhere in the World

South America and the Eastern United States Outside of Mesoamerica, evidence of independent domestication of plants comes from at least two areas in the New World: South America and the eastern United States. The first plants to be domesticated in the New World were members of the cucurbit family, including the bottle gourd and a variety of squashes, all probably domesticated some time after 7500 b.c. In addition to these and other plants domesticated in Mesoamerica, we can trace more than 200 domesticated plants to the Andes in South America, including potatoes, lima beans, peanuts, amaranth, and quinoa (see the box feature on "Raised Field Agriculture"). The first clear domesticates were squashes and gourds, which may date back to 8000 b.c., which makes domestication in the Andes as old as in Mesoamerica and perhaps even older.58 The origins of the root crops manioc and sweet potato are less certain, but those crops probably originated in lowland tropical forest regions of South America.<sup>59</sup>

Many of the plants grown in North America, such as corn, beans, and squash, were apparently introduced from Mesoamerica. However, at least three seed plants were probably domesticated independently in North America at an earlier time—sunflowers, sumpweed, and goosefoot. Sunflowers and sumpweed contain seeds that are highly nutritious in terms of protein and fat; goosefoot is high in starch and similar to corn in food value.60 Sumpweed is an unusually good source of calcium, rivaled only by greens, mussels, and bones. It is also a very good source of iron (better than beef liver) and thiamine.61 These plants may have been cultivated in the area of Kentucky, Tennessee, and southern Illinois beginning around 2000 b.c. (Corn was introduced about a.d. 200.)

All of the domesticates before corn are nutritionally superior to corn, so why did North American agriculturalists switch to a reliance on corn in the last 1,000 years?62 In archaeologist Bruce Smith's words, "With the exception of the sunflower, North American seed crops are not exactly household words."63 Crop yields of corn would have had to be quite high to surpass the yields of those other crops, so perhaps the crucial factors were the time of harvest and the amount of effort required. Goosefoot, for example, was comparable to corn nutritionally. But harvesting and preparing it for storage took a lot of work and also had to be done during the fall, the time of year when deer could be hunted intensively. So perhaps the incompatibility of goosefoot production and deer hunting, and the ease of harvesting corn and preparing it for storage, explain the switch to corn.64

On the whole, domestic animals were less important economically in the New World than they were in many parts of the Old World. In North America, dogs and turkeys were the main domesticated animals before the arrival of the Spanish. Dogs in North and South America probably accompanied the first colonizers of the Americas, as all domestic dogs appear to be descended from a common Asian ancestor.65 Domesticated turkeys from about a.d. 500 have been found in pueblos in the American Southwest.66 Their feathers were used for arrows, ornaments, and weaving, and their bones for tools; but they do not seem to have been used frequently for food. However, turkeys were an important food in Mexico, where they may have been independently domesticated, and in Central America. When Cortes came to Mexico in 1519, he found domesticated turkeys in great quantities.<sup>67</sup>

The central Andes was the only part of the New World where animals were a significant part of the economy. Used for meat, transportation, and wool, llamas and alpacas (members of the camel family) were domesticated as early as 5000 b.c. in the Andes.68 Guinea pigs, misnamed because they are neither pigs nor from Guinea, are rodents that were domesticated in the Andes sometime later. They were an important source of food even before domestication.69 Since they were domesticated, they have been raised in people's dwellings.

Animal domestication in the New World differed from that in the Old World because different wild species were found in the two hemispheres. The Old World plains and forests were the homes for the wild ancestors of the cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and horses we know today. In the New World, the Pleistocene herds of horses, mastodons, mammoths, and other large animals were long extinct, allowing few opportunities for domestication of large animals.<sup>70</sup>

# **Applied Anthropology**

### **Raised Field Agriculture**

ost agricultural systems in the Americas today rely upon either animal power or large machines to cultivate the soil and harvest food. But in the past, people had no traction animals or machines to help with agricultural production. How did the ancient farmers in the Americas till the soil and harvest crops? The answer is that they used human labor. In most cases, animal or mechanical power is much more efficient than human power and allows more food to be grown on the same piece of land. Archaeologists, however, have found that some ancient, human-powered agricultural systems are actually better suited to specific local environments and produce more food than modern, mechanized systems. These archaeologists have started to use their knowledge of ancient food production to help modern communities improve their lives.

Archaeologist Clark Erickson calls this work "applied archaeology," and he has been conducting applied archaeological work in South America for decades. One of his most significant projects involved the reconstruction of raised fields in the community of Huatta near Lake Titicaca in highland Peru. The environment there is relatively harsh. Early agricultural development projects tried and failed to make the land surrounding Huatta productive. But Erickson recognized that most of the area surrounding the community had once been highly productive raised fields, and he wondered if rebuilding these ancient agricultural structures might help the community.

![](_page_16_Picture_5.jpeg)

Raised field agriculture in practice.

Raised fields are created by piling soil into a long mound, which becomes surrounded by a ditch as soil is taken from it and piled on the mound. Over time, the ditch fills with water and aquatic plants. The aquatic plants are harvested annually and placed on top of the mound as fertilizer. The water in the ditch both keeps the mound soil moist and helps control the soil temperature. As a system, raised fields form a self-sustaining agricultural microenvironment. The major drawback is that mechanized equipment cannot be used easily on these mounds and ditches, so significant amounts of human labor are often required.

Erickson began working with members of the Huatta community to rebuild several of the ancient raised

fields. About five years later it was clear that raised field agriculture was well suited to the area. Raised fields were not as labor-intensive as initially thought and were as productive as nearby agricultural fields built upon better soils. More significantly, the "manure" from aquatic plants maintained the soils in the raised fields and actually improved them over time. So, although more labor-intensive, raised fields were able to bring otherwise marginal land into full agricultural production. Although many problems have arisen, including some failures, parts of the Lake Titicaca basin have been returned to raised field agriculture.

**East Asia** The archaeological record for the domestication of seed crops is better known than for soft-flesh crops because the latter do not preserve well. The earliest clear evidence of cereal cultivation outside the Near East is from China. Late in the 6th millennium B.C. in North China there were sites where foxtail millet was cultivated. Storage pits, storage pots, and large numbers of grinding stones suggest that millet was an enormously important item in the diet. The wild animal bones and the hunting and fishing tools that have been found suggest that people still depended on hunting and fishing somewhat, even though domesticated pigs (as well as dogs) were present. In South China, from about the same time, archaeologists have found a village by the edge of a small lake where people

cultivated rice, bottle gourds, water chestnuts, and the datelike fruit called jujube. The people in South China also raised water buffalo, pigs, and dogs. And, as in the North China sites, some of their food came from hunting and fishing.71

Mainland Southeast Asia may have been a place of domestication as early as the Near East was. The dating of domestication in Southeast Asia is not yet clear; the dates of the oldest site with probable domesticates—Spirit Cave in northwest Thailand—range from about 9500 b.c. to 5500 b.c. Some of the plants found at Spirit Cave are not clearly distinguishable from wild varieties, but others, such as gourds, betel nut, betel leaf, and water chestnut, were probably domesticates.72

Most of the early cultivation in mainland Southeast Asia seems to have occurred in the plains and low terraces around rivers, although the main subsistence foods of early cultivators were probably the fish and shellfish in nearby waters. The first plants to be domesticated probably were not cereal grains, as they were in the Near East. Indeed, some early cultivated crops may not have been used for food at all. In particular, bamboo may have been used to make cutting tools and for a variety of building purposes, and gourds were probably used as containers or bowls. We do not know yet exactly when rice was first domesticated, but there is definite evidence of cultivated rice in Thailand after 4000 b.c.

Bananas and taro may have been first domesticated in New Guinea. Analyses of soils from archaeological deposits at Kuk Swamp have identified phytoliths (small silica crystals formed between plant cells that are unique to particular species of plants) from bananas and taro dating from almost 7,000 years ago.73 Archaeologists have known that agricultural fields with soil mounds and irrigation features have a long history in New Guinea, dating back as far as 10,000 years. The discovery of very early taro and banana cultivation suggests that New Guinea may have been the location where these plants were first domesticated. Other major food plants domesticated in Southeast Asia include yams, breadfruit, and coconuts.<sup>74</sup>

![](_page_17_Picture_5.jpeg)

Bananas and taro were domesticated in New Guinea nearly 7,000 years ago. Bananas are now grown in many tropical regions, including Ghana pictured here.

Africa Some plants and animals were domesticated first in Africa. Most of the early domestications probably occurred in the wide, broad belt of woodland-savanna country south of the Sahara and north of the equator. Among the cereal grains, sorghum was probably first domesticated in the central or eastern part of this belt, bulrush millet and a kind of rice (different from Asian rice) in the western part, and finger millet in the east. Groundnuts (peanuts) and yams were first domesticated in West Africa.75 We do know that farming became widespread in the northern half of Africa after 6000 b.c.; investigators continue to debate whether the earliest crops grown there were indigenous or borrowed from the Near East. There is little doubt, however, that some of the plant foods were first domesticated in sub-Saharan Africa because the wild varieties occur there. Many of the important domestic animals in Africa today, especially sheep and goats, were first domesticated elsewhere in the Old World, but one form of cattle, as well as donkey and guinea fowl, was probably first domesticated in Africa.76

10.3 Evaluate theories for why food production developed.

## Why Did Food Production Develop?

We know that an economic transformation occurred in widely separate areas of the world beginning after about 10,000 years ago as people began to domesticate plants and animals. But why did domestication occur? And why did it occur independently in many different places within a period of a few thousand years? Considering that people depended

![](_page_18_Picture_5.jpeg)

only on wild plants and animals for millions of years, the differences in exactly when domestication first occurred in different parts of the world seem small. The spread of domesticated plants seems to have been more rapid in the Old World than in the New World, perhaps because the Old World spread was more along an east-west axis (except for the spread to sub-Saharan Africa), whereas the New World spread was more north-south. Spreading north and south may have required more time to adapt to variation in day lengths, climates, and diseases.77

There are many theories of why food production developed; most have tried to explain the origin of domestication in the area of the Fertile Crescent. Gordon Childe's theory, popular in the 1950s, was that a drastic change in climate caused domestication in the Near East.78 According to Childe, the postglacial period was marked by a decline in summer rainfall in the Near East and northern Africa. As the rains decreased, people were forced to retreat into shrinking pockets, or oases, of food resources surrounded by desert. The lessened availability of wild resources provided an incentive for people to cultivate grains and to domesticate animals, according to Childe.

Robert Braidwood criticized Childe's theory for two reasons. First, Braidwood believed that the climate changes may not have been as dramatic as Childe had assumed, and therefore the "oasis incentive" may not have existed. Second, the climatic changes that occurred in the Near East after the retreat of the last glaciers had probably occurred at earlier interglacial periods too, but there had never been a similar foodproducing revolution before. Hence, according to Braidwood, there must be more to the explanation of why people began to produce food than simply changes in climate.79

Braidwood and Gordon Willey claimed that people did not undertake domestication until they had learned a great deal about their environment and until their culture had evolved enough for them to handle such an undertaking: "Why did incipient food production not come earlier? Our only answer at the moment is that culture was not ready to achieve it."80

But most archaeologists now think we should try to explain why people were not "ready" earlier to achieve domestication. Both Lewis Binford and Kent Flannery suggest that some change in external circumstances must have induced or favored the changeover to food production.81 As Flannery pointed out, there is no evidence of a great economic incentive for hunter-gatherers to become food producers. In fact, some contemporary hunter-gatherers obtain adequate nutrition with far *less* work than many agriculturalists. So what might push food collectors to become food producers?

Binford and Flannery thought that the incentive to domesticate animals and plants may have been a desire to reproduce what was wildly abundant in the most bountiful or optimum hunting and gathering areas. Because of population growth in the optimum areas, people might have moved to surrounding areas containing fewer wild resources. In those marginal areas, people might have first turned to food production to reproduce what they used to have.

The Binford-Flannery model seems to fit the archaeological record in the Levant, the southwestern part of the Fertile Crescent, where population increase did precede the first signs of domestication.82 But, as Flannery admitted, in some regions, such as southwestern Iran, the optimum hunting and gathering areas do not show population increase before the emergence of domestication.83

The Binford-Flannery model focuses on population pressure in a small area as the incentive to turn to food production. Mark Cohen theorizes that population pressure on a global scale explains why so many of the world's peoples adopted agriculture within the span of a few thousand years.84 He argues that hunter-gatherers all over the world gradually increased in population so that the world was more or less filled with foragers by about 10,000 years ago. Thus, people could no longer relieve population pressure by moving to uninhabited areas. To support their increasing populations, they would have had to exploit a broader range of less desirable wild foods; that is, they would have had to switch to broad-spectrum collecting, or they would have had to increase the yields of the most desirable wild plants by weeding, protecting them from animal pests, and perhaps deliberately planting the most productive among them. Cohen thinks that people might have tried a variety of these strategies but would generally have ended up depending on cultivation because that would have been the most efficient way to allow more people to live in one place.

Recently, some archaeologists have returned to the idea that climatic change (not the extreme variety that Childe envisaged) might have played a role in the emergence of agriculture. It seems clear from the evidence now available that the climate of the Near East about 13,000 years to 12,000 years ago became more seasonal: The summers got hotter and drier than before and the winters became colder. These climatic changes may have favored the emergence of annual species of wild grain, which archaeologically we see proliferating in many areas of the Near East.85 People such as the Natufians intensively exploited the seasonal grains, developing an elaborate technology for storing and processing the grains and giving up their previous nomadic existence to do so. The transition to agriculture may have occurred when sedentary foraging no longer provided sufficient resources for the population. This could have happened because sedentarization led to population increase and therefore resource scarcity86 or because local wild resources became depleted after people settled down in permanent villages.87 In the area of Israel and Jordan where the Natufians lived, some of the people apparently turned to agriculture, probably to increase the supply of grain, whereas other people returned to nomadic foraging because of the decreasing availability of wild grain.<sup>88</sup>

Change to a more seasonal climate might also have led to a shortage of certain nutrients for foragers. In the dry seasons, certain nutrients would have been less available. For example, grazing animals get lean when grasses are not plentiful, so meat from hunting would have been in short supply in the dry seasons. Although it may seem surprising, some recent hunter-gatherers have starved when they had to rely on lean meat. If they could have increased their carbohydrate or fat intake somehow, they might have been more likely to get through the periods of lean game.89 So it is possible that some foragers in the past thought of planting crops to get them through the dry seasons when hunting, fishing, and gathering did not provide enough carbohydrates and fat for them to avoid starvation.

Mesoamerica presents a very different picture because the early domesticates were not important to subsistence. Theories about population pressure and nutrient shortage don't seem to fit Mesoamerica well. However, there were apparently shortages of desired plants, such as bottle gourds, and domestication may well have occurred as humans actively sowed these desired plants. The difference between this model and the ones described previously is that humans in Mesoamerica were apparently not forced into domestication by climate change or population pressure but actively turned to domestication to obtain more of the most desired or useful plant species. The most interesting case is maize, which only became a staple food some 2,500 or more years after it was first domesticated. Why did it become a staple? Probably both because it was a suitable staple crop (especially when intercropped with beans and squash, as discussed earlier) and because people liked it, so they grew it in large quantities. Over time, and perhaps because of conflict, population pressure, and other forces similar to those that apparently led to domestication in the Near East, people in Mesoamerica and later North and South America came to rely on maize as their dietary mainstay.

10.4 Critically analyze the consequences of food production.

### Consequences of the Rise of Food Production

We know that intensive agriculture (permanent rather than shifting cultivation) probably developed in response to population pressure, but we do not know for sure that population pressure was even partly responsible for plant and animal domestication in the first place. Still, population growth certainly accelerated after the rise of food production (see Figure 10.7). There were other consequences too. Paradoxically, perhaps, health seems to have declined. Material possessions, though, became more elaborate (also see the box feature on "The Archaeology of Environmental Collapse").

![](_page_20_Figure_6.jpeg)

The rate of population growth accelerated after the emergence of farming and herding 10,000 years ago. The rate of growth accelerated even more dramatically in recent times.

*Source*: Coale 1974.

### Accelerated Population Growth

As we have seen, settling down (even before the rise of food production) may have increased the rate of human population growth. But population growth definitely accelerated after the emergence of farming and herding, possibly because the spacing between births was reduced further and therefore fertility (the number of births per mother) increased. Increased fertility may have been advantageous because of the greater value of children in farming and herding economies; there is evidence from recent population studies that fertility rates are higher where children contribute more to the economy.90

Not only may parents desire more children to help with chores; the increased workload of mothers may also (but inadvertently) decrease birth spacing. The busier a mother is, the less frequently she may nurse and the more likely her baby will be given supplementary food by

### The Archaeology of Environmental Collapse

n The Life of Reason, philosopher George Santayana (1905) wrote, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." Archaeologists have long sought to provide a way for government agencies to remember the past so that mistakes will not be repeated. Today, the world's governments are struggling with problems of environmental degradation and global warming, but this is nothing new to archaeologists. Societies have routinely damaged or even destroyed their environments and either developed solutions or collapsed.

In the 1990s, the European Union (EU) decided that an archaeological perspective might help them to better understand the problem of land degradation within Europe. A team of archaeologists, geographers, environmental scientists, and others developed the ARCHAEOMEDES project for the EU, with the expressed purpose of developing a long-term perspective on the problem of land degradation. To date, the ARCHAEO-MEDES team has completed case

studies on four situations of land degradation spanning the range of human history in Europe from the Bronze Age to the present, and more are planned.

One example is the Rhône Valley of southeastern France. During the first few centuries A.D., the Rhône experienced a major period of Roman colonization. Hundreds of new towns emerged, transportation and water management systems were put in place, and thousands of acres were brought into agricultural production. Much of the agricultural production was market-oriented, particularly olive oil and wine. But, by the fifth century A.D., much of the region had been deserted, and agricultural land had been degraded (mainly by erosion) to the point that some has not yet recovered. What happened?

The ARCHAEOMEDES team found that the answer was complex. Minor climatic fluctuations increased the amount of rainfall and runoff from the Alps, causing periodic floods that forced farmers to abandon large

parts of the Rhône floodplain. But water control systems the Romans put in place exacerbated the problem, extending flooding to other areas and fostering high levels of erosion.

The ARCHAEOMEDES team concluded that the environmental crisis of the first centuries A.D. in the Rhône Valley were largely political and economic in their origins. The changes Roman colonists imposed on the Rhône Valley triggered land degradation because the infrastructure could only be sustained during good times. When too much rain fell, flooding could not be controlled, and the system collapsed. The lesson seems clear. The environment itself did not collapse; human alterations to the environment could not adapt to "normal" fluctuations in the climate and sparked an environmental crisis. It is a lesson the ARCHAEOMEDES team hopes European governments will take to heart.

other caretakers such as older siblings.<sup>91</sup> Less frequent nursing<sup>92</sup> and greater reliance on food other than mother's milk may result in an earlier resumption of ovulation after the birth of a baby. (Farmers and herders are likely to have animal milk to feed to babies, and also cereals that have been transformed by cooking into soft, mushy porridges.) Therefore, the spacing between births may have decreased (and the number of births per mother, in turn, increased) when mothers got busier after the rise of food production.

### **Declining Health**

Although the rise of food production may have led to increased fertility, this does not mean that health generally improved. In fact, it appears that health declined at least sometimes with the transition to food production. The two trends may seem paradoxical, but rapid population growth can occur if each mother gives birth to a large number of babies, even if many of them die early because of disease or poor nutrition.

The evidence that health may have declined sometimes after the rise of food production comes from studies of the bones and teeth of some prehistoric populations, before and after the emergence of food production. Nutritional and disease problems are indicated by such features as incomplete formation of tooth enamel, nonaccidental bone lesions (incompletely filled-in bone), reduction in stature, and decreased life expectancy. Many of the studied prehistoric populations that relied heavily on agriculture seem to show less adequate nutrition and higher infection rates than populations living in the same areas before agriculture.<sup>93</sup> Some of the agricultural populations are shorter and had lower life expectancies.

The reasons for a decline in health in those populations are not yet clear. Greater malnutrition can result from an overdependence on a few dietary staples that lack some necessary nutrients. Overdependence on a few sources of food may also increase the risk of famine because the fewer the staple crops, the greater the danger to the food supply posed by a weather-caused crop failure. But some or most nutritional problems may be the result of social and political factors, particularly the rise of different socioeconomic classes of people and unequal access, between and within communities, to food and other resources.94

Social stratification or considerable socioeconomic inequality seems likely to develop after the rise of food production. The effects of stratification and political dominance from afar on the general level of health may be reflected in the skeletal remains of prehistoric Native Americans who died in what is now Illinois between a.d. 950 and a.d. 1300, the period spanning the changeover in that region from hunting and gathering to agriculture. The agricultural people living in the area of Dickson Mounds—burial sites named after the doctor who first excavated them—were apparently in much worse health than their hunter-gatherer ancestors. But curiously, archaeological evidence suggests that they were still also hunting and fishing. A balanced diet was apparently available, but who was getting it? Possibly it was the elites at Cahokia, 110 miles away, where perhap. 15,000 people lived, who were getting most of the meat and fish. The individuals near Dickson Mounds who collected the meat and fish may have gotten luxury items such as shell necklaces from the Cahokia elites, but many of the people buried at Dickson Mounds were clearly not benefiting nutritionally from the relationship with Cahokia.<sup>95</sup>

### The Elaboration of Material Possessions

In the more permanent villages that were established after the rise of food production about 10,000 years ago, houses became more elaborate and comfortable, and construction methods improved. The materials used in construction depended on whether timber or stone was locally available or whether a strong sun could dry mud bricks. Modern architects might find to their surprise that bubble-shaped houses were known long ago in Neolithic Cyprus. Families in the island's town of Khirokitia made their homes in large, domed, circular dwellings shaped like beehives and featuring stone foundations and mud-brick walls.

Sophisticated ceramics like this 5,000-year-old Chinese funeral urn first appeared in the Neolithic era as part of the elaboration of material possessions.

Often, more space was created by dividing the interior horizontally and firmly propping a second floor on limestone pillars.

Sizable villages of solidly constructed, gabled wooden houses were built in Europe on the banks of the Danube and along the rims of Alpine lakes.96 Many of the gabled wooden houses in the Danube region were long, rectangular structures that apparently sheltered several family units. In Neolithic times, these longhouses had doors, beds, tables, and other furniture that closely resembled those in modern-day societies. We know the people had furniture because miniature clay models have been found at their sites. Several of the chairs and couches seem to be models of padded and upholstered furniture with wooden frames, indicating that Neolithic European artisans were creating fairly sophisticated furnishings.97 Such furnishings were the result of an advanced tool technology put to use by a people who, because they were staying in one area, could take time to make and use furniture.

For the first time, apparel made of woven textiles appeared. This development was not simply the result of the domestication of flax (for linen), cotton, and wool-growing sheep. These sources of fiber alone could not produce cloth. It was the development by Neolithic society of the spindle and loom for spinning and weaving that made textiles possible. True, textiles can be woven by hand without a loom, but to do so is a slow, laborious process, impractical for producing garments.

The pottery of the early Neolithic was similar to the plain earthenware made by some preagricultural groups and included large urns for grain storage, mugs, cooking pots, and dishes. To improve the retention of liquid, potters in the Near East may have been the first to glaze the earthenware's porous surface. Later, Neolithic ceramics became more artistic. Designers shaped the clay into graceful forms and painted colorful patterns on the vessels.

It is probable that virtually none of these architectural and technological innovations could have occurred until humans became fully sedentary. Nomadic hunting and gathering peoples would have found it difficult to carry many material goods, especially fragile items such as pottery. Only when humans settled in one place would these goods have provided advantages, enabling villagers to cook and store food more effectively and to house themselves more comfortably.

There is also evidence of long-distance trade in the Neolithic, as we have noted. Obsidian from southern Turkey was being exported to sites in the Zagros Mountains of Iran and to what are now Israel, Jordan, and Syria in the Levant. Great amounts of obsidian were exported to sites about 190 miles from the source of supply; more than 80 percent of the tools that residents of those areas used were made of this material.98 Marble was being sent from western to eastern Turkey, and seashells from the coast were traded to distant inland regions. Such trade suggests a considerable amount of contact among various Neolithic communities.

About 3500 b.c., cities first appeared in the Near East. These cities had political assemblies, kings, scribes, and specialized workshops. The specialized production of goods and services was supported by surrounding farming villages, which sent their produce to the urban centers. A dazzling transformation had taken place in a relatively short time. People had not only settled down, but they had also become "civilized," or urbanized. (The word *civilized* literally means to make "citified.") Urban societies seem to have developed first in the Near East and somewhat later around the eastern Mediterranean, in the Indus Valley of northwestern India, in northern China, and in Mexico and Peru.

# Summary and Review

### Preagricultural Developments

10.1 Explain the relationship between broad-spectrum collecting, sedentarism, and population growth in terms of preagricultural developments.

- • In the period immediately before plants and animals were domesticated, there seems to have been a shift in many areas of the world to less dependence on big game hunting and greater dependence on what is called broad-spectrum collecting.
- • The broad spectrum of available resources frequently included aquatic resources such as fish and shellfish and a variety of wild plants, deer, and other game.
- • Climatic changes may have been partly responsible for the change to broad-spectrum collecting.
- • In Europe, the Near East, Africa, and Peru, the switch to broad-spectrum collecting seems to be associated with more permanent communities. But in areas of Mesoamerica, domestication of plants and animals may have preceded permanent settlements.

What were some of the preagricultural developments in the Near East and Mesoamerica that might have led to agriculture?

### The Domestication of Plants and Animals

10.2 Discuss the domestication of plants and animals in the Near East, Mesoamerica, and elsewhere in the world.

- • Domestication refers to changes in plants and animals that make them more useful to humans. Often, without human assistance, domesticated plants and animals cannot reproduce. Neolithic cultures reflect the presence of domestication.
- • The earliest evidence of domestication comes from the Near East at about 8000 b.c.
- • In the New World early areas of cultivation and domestication include the highlands of Mesoamerica (about 7000 b.c.), the Central Andes around Peru (about the

same time but perhaps even earlier), and the Eastern Woodlands of North America (about 2000 b.c.).

• There were also probably independent centers of domestication in other areas of the Old World—China, Southeast Asia (what is now Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam), New Guinea, and Africa sometime around or after 6000 b.c.

What kinds of plants and animals were domesticated in the Near East, Mesoamerica, and South America?

### Why Did Food Production Develop?

10.3 Evaluate theories for why food production developed.

- • Theories about why food production originated remain controversial, but most archaeologists think that conditions must have pushed people to switch from collecting to producing food rather than food production being a voluntary choice.
- • One possible cause of food production may have been population growth in regions of bountiful wild resources, pushing people to move to marginal areas where they tried to reproduce their former abundance.
- • Another cause of food production may have been global population growth, filling most of the world's habitable regions and forcing people to use a broader spectrum of wild resources and to domesticate plants and animals.
- • Perhaps a third cause of food production was hotter and drier summers and colder winters, favoring sedentarism near seasonal stands of wild grain; resulting population growth may have forced people to plant crops and raise animals to support themselves.

• However, climate change or population pressure apparently did not lead to domestication in Mesoamerica, but humans in that area seem to have actively turned to domestication to obtain more of the most desired or useful plant species.

Compare two theories for the origins of agriculture. What are the strengths and the weaknesses of each theory?

### Consequences of the Rise of Food Production

10.4 Critically analyze the consequences of food production.

- • Regardless of why food production originated, it seems to have had important consequences for human life.
- • Plant and animal domestication led to substantial increases in population.
- • A greater reliance on agriculture led to an increase in sedentarism in many areas.
- • Populations that relied heavily on agriculture were less healthy compared with earlier foraging populations.
- • In more permanent villages, houses and furnishings became more elaborate, people began to make textiles and to paint pottery, long-distance trade seemed to increase, and political assemblies formed.

What were the consequences of food production?

# Think on it

- 1. What factors might cause people to work harder to get food?
- 2. How might people have domesticated sheep, goats, and cattle?
- 3. Do the various theories of the rise of food production explain why domestication occurred in many areas of the world within a few thousand years?
