Homo Genus to which modern humans and their ancestors belong.

 $\bullet$  etween about 2 million years ago and 500,000 years ago, there were many important Changes in hominin biological and cultural evolution. Among the most important was the routine use of patterned or nearly standardized stone toolsâ€”widely considered one sign that culture had emerged. Who made these tools? It is assumed, but not known for sure, that patterned stone tools were made by the first members of our own genus, *Homo*, because it is in our genus that we first see a number of trends that may have started because of habitual stone toolmaking and use: expansion of the brain; modification of the female pelvis to accommodate bigger-brained babies; and reduction in the teeth, face, and jaws.

Even though stone tools are found at various sites in East Africa before the time early *Homo* appeared, most anthropologists surmise that members of early *Homo* species, rather than the australopithecines, made those tools (see Figure 7.1). After all, early *Homo* had

![](_page_1_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_1_Figure_5.jpeg)

a brain capacity almost one-third larger than that of the australopithecines. But the fact is that none of the earliest stone tools is clearly associated with early *Homo*, so it is impossible as yet to know who made them.1 We turn now to a discussion of those earliest stone tools and what archaeologists and paleoanthropologists infer about the lifestyles of their makers, the hominins (whoever they were) who lived between about 2.5 million and 1.5 million years ago.

# Early Hominin Tools

The earliest identifiable stone tools found so far come from various sites in East Africa and date from about 2.5 million years ago and maybe earlier.2 The oldest tools, some 3,000 in number, were discovered at Gona, Ethiopia. They range from very small flakes (thumb-size) to cobble or core tools that are fist-size.3 These early tools were apparently made by striking a stone with another stone, a technique called **percussion flaking**. Both the sharp-edged flakes and the sharp-edged cores (the pieces of stone left after flakes are removed) were probably used as tools.

What were those earliest stone tools used for? What do they tell us about early hominin lifestyles? Unfortunately, little can be inferred about lifestyles from the earliest tool sites because little else was found with the tools. In contrast, finds of later tool assemblages at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania have yielded a rich harvest of cultural information. The Olduvai site was uncovered accidentally in 1911, when a German entomologist followed a butterfly into the gorge and found fossil remains. Well-known paleoanthropologists Louis and Mary Leakey searched the gorge for clues to the evolution of early humans beginning in the 1930s. Of the Olduvai site, Louis Leakey wrote,

*[It] is a fossil hunter's dream, for it shears 300 feet through stratum after stratum of earth's history as through a gigantic layer cake. Here, within reach, lie countless fossils and artifacts which but for the faulting and erosion would have remained sealed under thick layers of*

7.2 Describe early hominin lifestyles.

**Oldowan** The earliest stone toolmaking tradition, named after the tools found in Bed I at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, from about 2.5 million years ago. The stone artifacts include core tools and sharp-edged flakes made by striking one stone against another. Flake tools predominate. Among the core tools, so-called choppers are common.

The oldest cultural materials from Olduvai (Bed I) date from Lower Pleistocene times (about 1.6 million years ago). The stone artifacts include core tools and sharpedged flakes. Flake tools predominate. Among the core tools, so-called choppers are common. Choppers are cores that have been partially flaked and have a side that might have been used for chopping. Other core tools, with flaking along one side and a flat edge, are called scrapers. Whenever a stone has facets removed from only one side of the cutting edge, we call it a **unifacial tool**. If the stone has facets removed from both sides, we call it a **bifacial tool**. Although there are some bifacial tools in the early stone tool assemblages, they are not as plentiful or as elaborated as in later tool traditions. The kind of tool assemblage found in Bed I and to some extent in later (higher) layers is referred to as **Oldowan** (see Figure 7.2).<sup>5</sup>

## Early Hominin Lifestyles

Archaeologists have speculated about the lifestyles of early hominins from Olduvai and other sites. Some of these speculations come from analysis of what can be done with the tools, microscopic analysis of wear on the tools, and examination of the marks the tools make on bones; other speculations are based on what is found with the tools.

Archaeologists have experimented with what can be done with Oldowan tools. The flakes appear to be very versatile; they can be used for slitting the hides of animals, dismembering animals, and whittling wood into sharp-pointed sticks (wooden spears or digging sticks). The larger stone tools (choppers and scrapers) can be used to hack off branches or cut and chop tough animal joints.6 Those who have made and tried to use stone tools for various purposes are so impressed by the sharpness and versatility of flakes that they wonder whether most of the core tools were really used as tools. The cores could mainly be what remained after wanted flakes were struck off.<sup>7</sup>

Archaeologists surmise that many early tools were also made of wood and bone, but these do not survive in the archaeological record. Present-day populations use sharppointed digging sticks for extracting roots and tubers from the ground; stone flakes are very effective for sharpening wood to a very fine point.8

None of the early flaked stone tools can plausibly be thought of as weapons. So, if the toolmaking hominins were hunting or defending themselves with weapons, they had to have used wooden spears, clubs, or unmodified stones as missiles. Later, Oldowan tool assemblages also include stones that were flaked and battered into a rounded shape. The unmodified stones and the shaped stones might have been lethal projectiles.<sup>9</sup>

Experiments may indicate what can be done with tools, but they cannot tell us what was *actually* done with them. Other techniques, such as microscopic analysis of the wear on tools, are more informative. Early studies looked at the microscopic scratches formed when a tool was used in different ways. Scratches parallel to the edge of a tool often occur when a tool is used in a sawing motion; perpendicular scratches suggest whittling or scraping.10 Lawrence Keeley used high-powered microscopes in his experimental investigations of tools and found that different kinds of "polish" develop on tools when they are used on different materials. The polish on tools used for cutting meat is different from the polish on tools used for woodworking. On the basis of microscopic investigation of the 1.5-million-year-old tools from the eastern side of Lake Turkana, Keeley and his colleagues concluded that at least some of the early tools were probably used for cutting meat, others for cutting or whittling wood, and still others for cutting plant stems.<sup>11</sup>

In the 1950s and 1960s, Olduvai Gorge revealed the presence of both Oldowan tools and the remains of broken bones and teeth from many different animal species. For many years, it seemed plausible to assume that hominins were the hunters and the animals their prey. But archaeologists had to reexamine this assumption with the emergence of the field of *taphonomy*, which studies the processes that can alter and distort an assemblage of bones. So, for example, flowing water can bring bones and artifacts together, which may have happened at Olduvai Gorge about 1.8 million years ago. (The area of what is now the gorge bordered the shores of a shallow lake at that time.) Other animals such as hyenas could have also brought carcasses to some of the same places that hominins spent time. Taphonomy requires archaeologists to consider all the possible reasons things may be found together.<sup>12</sup>

But there is little doubt that hominins were cutting up animal carcasses for meat shortly after 2 million years ago. Microscopic analyses show that cut marks on animal bones were unambiguously created by stone flake tools, and microscopic analyses of the polish on stone tools indicate that the polish is consistent with butchering. We still do not know for sure whether the hominins around Olduvai Gorge were just scavenging meat (taking meat from the kills of other animals) or actually hunting the animals.

On the basis of her analysis of cut marks on bone from Bed I in Olduvai Gorge, Pat Shipman suggested that scavenging, not hunting, was the major meat-getting activity of the hominins living there between 2 million and 1.7 million years ago. For example, the cut marks made by the stone tools usually (but not always) overlie teeth marks made by carnivores. This suggests that the hominins were often scavenging the meat of animals killed and partially eaten by nonhominin predators. The fact that the cut marks were sometimes made first, however, suggested to Shipman that the hominins were also sometimes the hunters.13 On the other hand, prior cut marks may indicate only that the hominins scavenged before carnivores had a chance to consume their prey.

The artifact and animal remains from Bed I and the lower part of Bed II at Olduvai suggest a few other things about the lifestyles of the hominins there. First, it seems that the hominins moved around during the year; most of the sites in what is now the Olduvai Gorge appear to have been used only in the dry season, as indicated by an analysis of the kinds of animal bones found there.14 Second, whether the early Olduvai hominins were hunters or scavengers, they apparently exploited a wide range of animals. Although most of the bones are from medium-sized antelopes and wild

![](_page_4_Picture_5.jpeg)

The Production of a Simple Oldowan Chopper Core and the Resultant Flakes

pigs, even large animals such as elephants and giraffes seem to have been eaten.15 It is clear, then, that the Olduvai hominins scavenged or hunted for meat, but we cannot tell yet how important meat was in their diet.

There is also no consensus about how to characterize the Olduvai sites that contain concentrations of stone tools and animal bones. In the 1970s, there was a tendency to think of them as home bases to which hominins (presumably male) brought meat to share with others (presumably nursing mothers and young children). Indeed, Mary Leakey identified two locations where she thought early hominins had built simple structures (Figure 7.3). One was a stone circle that she suggested formed the base of a small brush windbreak. The other was a circular area of dense debris surrounded by an area virtually without debris. Leakey suggested

![](_page_5_Picture_1.jpeg)

![](_page_5_Figure_2.jpeg)

A ring of stones and bones found in Bed I of Olduvai Gorge that Mary Leakey interpreted as the remains of an ancient hut.

that the area lacking debris may represent the location of a ring of thorny brush with which early hominins surrounded their campsite in order to keep out predatorsâ€”much like pastoralists living in the region do today.<sup>16</sup> But archaeologists today are not so sure that these sites were home bases. For one thing, carnivores also frequented the sites. Places with meaty bones lying around may not have been so safe for hominins to use as home bases. Second, the animal remains at the sites had not been completely dismembered and butchered. If the sites had been hominin home bases, we would expect more complete processing of carcasses.17 Third, natural processes as simple as trees growing through a site can create circular

areas of debris such as the ones Leakey identified as structures, and without better evidence that early hominins made them, one cannot be sure that the circles of debris were indeed structures.<sup>18</sup>

If these sites were not home bases, what were they? Some archaeologists are beginning to think that these early sites with many animal bones and tools may just have been places where hominins processed food but did not live. Why would the hominins return repeatedly to a particular site? Richard Potts suggests one possible reasonâ€”that hominins left caches of stone tools and stones for toolmaking at various locations to facilitate recurrent food-collecting and processing activities.19 Future research may tell us more about early hominin life. Did they have home bases, or did they just move from one processing site to another? How did they protect themselves from predators? They apparently did not have fire to keep the predators away. Did they climb trees to get away or to sleep?

### Stone Tools and Culture

Regardless of the answers to these questions, the presence of patterned stone tools means that these early hominins had probably developed *culture*. Archaeologists consider a pattern of behavior, such as a particular way to make a tool that is shared and learned by a group of individuals, to be a sign of cultural behavior. To be sure, toolmaking does not imply that early humans had anything like the complex cultures of humans today. Chimpanzees have patterns of tool use and toolmaking that appear to be shared and learned, but they do not have that much in the way of cultural behavior.

What, exactly, makes human culture so different from other forms of animal behavior? Anthropologists have spent more than a century trying to answer this question, and there is still no widely accepted answer. One thing is clear, however: Culture must be understood as a set of interrelated processes, not as a thing.20 What are the processes that make up culture? Let's consider some of the more important ones.

First, culture is *learned* as well as *shared*. This is the fundamental difference between culture and most other forms of animal behavior. Culture is not a set of innate behaviors but rather a set of learned ones. Culture is something individuals acquire during their lifetimes as they mature and interact with others. Interaction is key here because not only are cultural behaviors learned, they are learned through interaction with others, through

education, and through shared experiences. Culture, then, is a social process, not an individual one. It also includes attitudes, values, and ideals as well as behavior.

Second, culture is generally *adaptive*. What this means is that most of the learned and shared behaviors that make up a culture are thought to have developed and spread through a group of people because they help that group of people survive in a given environment. Thus, cultural behaviors may be favored by natural selection just as genes are. The extent to which human culture is a product of natural selection is hotly debated, but few anthropologists would argue that culture is not a key aspect of human adaptation. What makes culture quite different from the behavioral systems of other animals is that, because culture is learned and shared rather than innate, humans can develop new behaviors quickly and adapt to diverse and changing conditions with relative ease. Adaptation, then, is perhaps the most significant process of culture.

Change is the third major process of culture, for culture is always *changing*. Culture change regularly occurs as new and beneficial means of adaptation are developed and shared. But anthropologists also assume that, when new behaviors or ideas are developed, they tend to become integrated with existing behaviors or ideas. That is, new items that conflict with established ones may lead to one or the other changing. For example, a group of early humans could not have both scavenged meat and, at the same time, prohibited eating meat that they did not themselves kill. Such a situation would create a contradiction, and something would probably have to change. Working out contradictions between new, highly beneficial behaviors and established but less beneficial ones may be one of the reasons that cultures are so dynamic. It seems clear that the early hominins, like other primates, were social beings. It also seems clear from the archaeological record that early hominins were making and using stone tools on a regular basis. Tools are frequently found in discrete concentrations, and often in association with animal bones and other debris from human activity. And, as we have already noted, a number of paleoanthropologists have argued that such concentrations of debris may represent campsites or even small shelters. Home bases of some sort may have been a part of early hominin culture.

Whether they reflect home bases or not, large numbers of animal bones and tools are found in discrete locations, and these accumulations suggest that groups of individuals used the areas over periods of time. In such a situation, sharing of food is very likely. It seems counterintuitive to think that individuals would have purposely brought food to a common location only to keep it to themselves. Although we must move into the realm of pure speculation, it does seem reasonable to think that closely related individuals, like parents, children, and siblings, would be more likely to associate and share food with one another than more distantly related individuals. This speculation is supported by the fact that, when food sharing takes place among chimpanzees, it is usually among closely related individuals.21 Thus, the ancient locations of early hominin social activity may be evidence of family groups. How would such a system of social behaviorâ€”the creation of a common meeting, resting, and living place for a group of related individuals to share foodâ€”have evolved? Let's consider one model.

### One Model for the Evolution of Culture

Early *Homo* had a brain almost one-third larger than that of the australopithecines. As we discuss later in the section on trends in hominin evolution, one of the possible consequences of brain expansion was the lessening of maturity at birth. The fact that babies were born more immature may at least partly explain the lengthening of the period of infant and child dependency in hominins. Compared with other animals, we spend not only a longer proportion of our life span, but also the longest absolute period, in a dependent state. Prolonged infant dependency has probably been of great significance in human cultural evolution. According to Theodosius Dobzhansky,

*it is this helplessness and prolonged dependence on the ministrations of the parents and other persons that favors . . . the socialization and learning process on which the transmission of culture wholly depends. This may have been an overwhelming advantage of the human growth pattern in the process of evolution.*<sup>22</sup>

It used to be thought that the australopithecines had a long period of infant dependency, just as modern humans do, but the way their teeth apparently developed suggests that the early australopithecines followed an apelike pattern of development. Thus, prolonged maturation may be relatively recent, but just how recent is not yet known.23

Although some use of tools for digging, defense, or scavenging may have influenced the development of bipedalism, full bipedalism may have made possible more efficient toolmaking and consequently more efficient foraging and scavenging. As we have seen, there are archaeological signs that early hominins may have been scavenging (and perhaps even hunting) animals as far back as the late Pliocene. Indeed, we have fairly good evidence that early hominins were butchering and presumably eating big game some 2 million years ago.

Whenever it was that hominins began to scavenge for game and perhaps hunt regularly, the development of scavenging would have required individuals to travel long distances frequently in search of suitable carcasses. Among groups of early *Homo*, longer infant and child dependency may have fostered the creation of home bases or at least established meeting places. The demands of childbirth and caring for a newborn might have made it difficult for early *Homo* mothers to travel for some time after the birth. Certainly, it would have been awkward for a mother carrying a nursing child to travel long distances to hunt. Although carrying an infant might be possible with a sling, successful hunting might not be so likely with a needy and potentially noisy child along. Because early *Homo* males (and perhaps females without young children) would have been freer to roam farther from home, they probably became the scavengers or hunters. Women with young children may have gathered wild plants within a small area that could be covered without traveling far from the home base or meeting place.

The creation of home bases or meeting places among early *Homo* groups may have increased the likelihood of food sharing. If mothers with young children were limited to gathering plant foods in a relatively small area, the only way to ensure that they and their children could obtain a complete diet would have been to share the other foods obtained elsewhere. With whom would such sharing take place? Most likely with close relatives. Sharing with them would have made it more likely that their offspring would survive to have offspring. Thus, if early *Homo* had home bases and families, those characteristics could have encouraged the development of the learned and shared behaviors we call culture.24 Obviously, this is a "just-so" storyâ€”a tale that we may never be able to prove really happened. However, it is a tale that is consistent with the archaeological record.<sup>25</sup>

7.3 Identify the main trends in hominin evolution.

# Trends in Hominin Evolution

With early *Homo*, we see the start of several trends in hominin evolution that appear to reflect the manufacture and use of patterned stone toolsâ€”the expansion of the brain, the modification of the female pelvis to accommodate bigger-brained babies, and a general reduction in the size of teeth, face, and jaws.

### Expansion of the Brain

The australopithecines had relatively small cranial capacities, about 380â€“530 cubic centimeters (cc)â€”not much larger than that of chimpanzees. But around 2.3 million years ago, close to the time that patterned stone tools first appeared, some hominins show evidence of enlarged brain capacity. These hominins, early *Homo*, had cranial capacities averaging about 630â€“640 cc, which is about 50 percent of the brain capacity of modern humans (which averages slightly more than 1,300 cc). (See Figure 7.4.) A later member of our genus, *Homo erectus*, which may have first appeared about 1.8 million years ago, had a cranial capacity averaging about 895â€“1,040 cc, or about 70 percent of the brain capacity of modern humans.26

The australopithecines were small, and the earliest *Homo* finds were hardly bigger, so much of the increase in brain size over time might have been a result of later hominins'

#### Figure 7.4

bigger bodies. When we correct for body size, however, it turns out that brain size increased not only absolutely but also relatively after 2 million years ago. Between about 4 million and 2 million years ago, relative brain size remained just about the same. Only in the last 2 million years has the hominin brain doubled in relative size and tripled in absolute size.27

What may have favored the increase in brain size? Many anthropologists think that the increase is linked to the emergence of stone toolmaking about 2.5 million years ago. The reasoning is that stone toolmaking was important for the survival of our ancestors, and therefore natural selection would have favored bigger-brained individuals because they had motor and conceptual skills that enabled them to be better toolmakers. According to this view, the expansion of the brain and more sophisticated toolmaking would have developed together. Other anthropologists think that the expansion of the brain may have been favored by other factors, such as warfare, hunting, longer life, and language.28 One intriguing theory is that life in complex social groups requires increased intelligence and memory, and that the creation of home bases and family groups may have fostered the expansion of the hominin brain.29 Whatever the factors favoring bigger brains, they also provided humans with an expanded capacity for culture. Thus, along with bipedalism, the expansion of the brain marks a watershed in human evolution.

As the hominin brain expanded, natural selection also favored the widening of the female pelvis to allow larger-brained babies to be born.30 But there was probably a limit to how far the pelvis could widen and still be adapted to bipedalism. Something had to give, and that something was the degree of physical development of the human infant at birthâ€”for instance, the human infant is born with cranial bones so plastic that they can overlap. Because birth takes place before the cranial bones have hardened, the human infant with its relatively large brain can pass through the opening in the mother's pelvis. Human infants are born at a relatively early stage of development and are wholly dependent on their parents for many years. As we have noted, this lengthy period of infant dependency may have been an important factor in the evolution of culture.

#### Reduction of the Face, Teeth, and Jaws

As in the case of the brain, substantial changes in the face, teeth, and jaws do not appear in hominin evolution until after about 2 million years ago. The australopithecines all have cheek teeth that are very large relative to their estimated body weight, perhaps because the diet of the australopithecines was especially high in plant foods,31 including small, tough objects such as seeds, grasses, and tubers. The australopithecines have thick jawbones, probably also related to their chewing needs. The australopithecines have relatively

![](_page_9_Figure_1.jpeg)

Figure 7.5 Comparison of *A. africanus* and *H. habilis*

large faces that project forward below the eyes. But when we get to the *Homo* forms, we see reduction in the size of the face, cheek teeth, and jaws (see Figure 7.5). It would seem that natural selection in favor of a bigger and stronger chewing apparatus was relaxed. One reason might be that members of the *Homo* genus started to eat foods that were easier to chew. Such foods might have included roots, fruits, and meat. As we discuss later, it may have been the development of habitual tool use and the control of fire that allowed members of the *Homo* genus to change their diet to include foods that are easier to chew, including meat. If food is cooked and easy to chew, individual humans with smaller jaws and teeth would not be disadvantaged, and therefore the face, cheek teeth, and jaw would get smaller on average over time.32

The expansion of the brain and reduction of the face occurred at about the same time and were probably related. A recent discovery in human genetics appears to provide direct evidence of a connection. Researchers studying muscle diseases in modern humans discovered that humans have a unique myosin gene called MYH16 (myosin is a protein in muscle tissue) that is only present in jaw muscles. Comparing MYH16 to related genes in primates, the researchers determined that MYH16 evolved about 2.4 million years ago around the time the brain began to enlarge and the face and jaw began to shrink. So, the expansion of the brain may have been aided by a mutation in myosin that caused jaw muscles to shrink.33

What is the evidence that the physical and behavioral changes we have been discussing occurred during the evolution of the *Homo* genus? We shall now consider the earliest *Homo* fossils and how they are associated with brain expansion and the reduction of the face, jaws, and teeth.

# Early *Homo*

Hominins with a brain absolutely and relatively larger than those of the australopithecines appear about 2.3 million years ago. These hominins, classified in our own genus, *Homo*, are generally divided into two species: *Homo habilis* and *Homo* 

#### *Homo habilis* Dating

from about 2 million years ago, an early species belonging to our genus, *Homo*, with cranial capacities averaging about 630â€“640 cc, about 50 percent of the brain capacity of modern humans.

#### *Homo rudolfensis*

Early species belonging to our genus, *Homo*. Similar enough to *Homo habilis* that some paleoanthropologists make no distinction between the two.

7.4 Describe early *Homo* species.

*rudolfensis*. Both are known primarily from the western parts of Kenya and Tanzania, but remains have been found elsewhere in eastern and southern Africa, including the Omo Basin of Ethiopia and Sterkfontein cave in South Africa. Both lived in the same place and time as the paranthropoid, *Paranthropus boisei* and may later have lived at the same time as *Homo erectus*.

*Homo habilis* appears to be the earlier of these two species, appearing around 2.3 million years ago. Compared with the australopithecines, *H. habilis* had a significantly larger brain, averaging 630â€“640 cc,34 and reduced molars and premolars.35 The rest of the skeleton is reminiscent of the australopithecines, including the presence of powerful hands and relatively long arms, suggesting that *H. habilis* was at least partially arboreal. *H. habilis* may also have been sexually dimorphic like the australopithecines, as individuals seem to have greatly differed in size.

*Homo rudolfensis* is roughly contemporary with *Homo habilis* and shares many of its features. Indeed, many paleoanthropologists make no distinction between the two species, putting *H. rudolfensis* into *H. habilis*. Those who do see them as distinct species point to the larger and more thickly enameled cheek teeth of *H. rudolfensis*, its flatter and broader face, and its more modernlike limb proportions. Even with its larger teeth and broader face, the dentition of *H. rudolfensis* is considerably reduced over the

australopithecines and, as in *H. habilis*, its brain is at least a third larger.

We have little postcranial skeletal material for either early *Homo* species, so it is impossible to tell whether the female pelvis had changed. But, with brains averaging a third larger than those of the australopithecines, it seems likely that some modifications must have developed to allow bigger-brained babies to be born. We do know that changes in the female pelvis to accommodate bigger-brained babies can be seen in *Homo erectus*, and it is this species that we turn to next.

![](_page_10_Picture_8.jpeg)

*Homo erectus* evolved very shortly after *Homo habilis*, probably about 1.8 million years ago. *Homo erectus* was the first hominin species to be widely distributed in the Old World (see the box feature on "The First Migrants"). Examples of *H. erectus* were found first in Java, later in China, and still later in Africa. Most paleoanthropologists agree that some human ancestor moved from Africa to Asia at some point. Until recently, it was assumed that it was *H. erectus* who moved because *H. erectus* lived in East Africa about 1.6 million years ago but *H. erectus* fossils were not found in Asia until after about 1 million years ago.36 However, more recent finds place *H. erectus* in Java perhaps. 1.8 million years ago,37 and *H. erectus* fossils from Dmanisi, in the southeastern European nation of Georgia, are dated to at least 1.7 million years ago.38 So early hominins may have moved out of Africa earlier than previously thought. Indeed, one well-preserved skull found at Dmanisi in 2001 has

The brain (averaging 895â€“1,040 cc) was larger than that found in any of the australopithecines or *H. habilis* but smaller than the average brain of a modern human.

some features that are reminiscent of *H. habilis*â€”a brain only about 600 cc, relatively large canines, and a relatively thin browridge.39 Although the excavators classify the skull as *H. erectus*, it does make one wonder whether *H. habilis* or transitional *habiliserectus* individuals were the first to leave Africa.

There is also the question of whether there is only one species *of H. erectus* or whether *H. erectus* contains several distinct species. Some scholars see enough differences between Asian and African populations of *H. erectus* to argue that they should be separated into two distinct species, *Homo erectus* for the Asian populations and *Homo ergaster* for the African ones. Furthermore, *Homo erectus* (or *Homo ergaster*) fossils are also found in Europe. But some paleoanthropologists think that the finds in Europe typically classified as *H. erectus* are actually early examples of *H. sapiens*. 40 Others think that the European fossils and similar ones found in southern Africa and the Near East should be grouped into a distinct species, *Homo heidelbergensis*. There is also *Homo floresiensis*, a diminutive hominin that appears to be a miniature form of *Homo erectus* that evolved only on the isolated island of Flores, Indonesia. It is all a bit confusing. Later we will try to sort it all out.

#### The Discovery of Homo erectus

In 1891, Eugene Dubois, a Dutch anatomist digging in Java, found what he called *Pithecanthropus erectus*, meaning "erect ape man." (We now refer to this hominin as *Homo erectus*.) The discovery was not the first humanlike fossil found, but no one was certain, not even Dubois himself, whether the fossil he found in Java was an ape or a human.

The actual find consisted of a cranium and a thighbone. For many years, it was thought that the fragments were not even from the same animal. The skull

was too large to be that of a modern ape but was smaller than that of an average human, having a cranial capacity between the average ape's 500 cc and the average modern human's 1,300 cc. The thighbone, however, matched that of a modern human. Did the two fragments in fact belong together? The question was resolved many years later by fluorine analysis. If fossils from the same deposit contain the same amount of fluorine, they are the same age. The skull fragment and thighbone found by Dubois were tested for fluorine content and found to be the same age.

A discovery by G. H. R. von Koenigswald in the mid-1930s, also in Java, not only confirmed Dubois's earlier speculations and extended our knowledge of the physical characteristics of *Homo erectus* but also gave us a better understanding of this early human's place in time. Since then, many more *H. erectus* fossils have been found in Java, some dating back to perhaps 1.8 million years ago.41

Between the times of Dubois's and von Koenigswald's discoveries, Davidson Black, a Canadian anatomy professor teaching in Peking (Beijing), China, set out to investigate a large cave at nearby Zhoukoudian where a fossilized tooth had been found. Confident that the tooth came from a hitherto unknown hominin genus, he obtained funds to excavate the area extensively. After two years of excavation, he and his colleagues found a skull in limestone, which they dubbed "Peking Man." Black died in 1934, and his work was carried on by Franz Weidenreich.

It was not until the 1950s that *H. erectus* fossils were uncovered in northern Africa (see Figure 7.6). Many finds since then have come from East Africa, particularly two

## **Migrants and Immigrants**

#### **The First Migrants**

ominins evolved in Africa, yet today hominins are found on every continent. Who were the first hominins to leave Africa, and when did they first leave? For many years, the clear answer was that Homo erectus were the first to leave Africa, and they did so perhaps 700,000 to 1 million years ago. In recent years, new findings and sources of evidence have led scholars to question this established answer.

The first new information came from geochemist Carl Swisher, who in the mid-1990s redated the Java sites where Homo erectus fossils had been found and determined they dated to perhaps 1.8 million years ago. Because the earliest H. erectus fossils in Africa share a similar date, this created a problem how did *H. erectus* appear in Java at about the same time they appeared in Africa? As this question was being pondered, a remarkable set of new H. erectus fossils were being uncovered in Dmanisi, Georgia. Dated at 1.7 million years ago, these fossils made it clear that *H. erectus* left Africa almost as soon as they had evolved. The discovery of Homo habilis-like fossil at Dmanisi, and of Oldowan-like tools at Riwat, Pakistan, and Longgupo, China, suggested that H. habilis may have been the first to leave Africa, and H. erectus followed a path their predecessors blazed. If they were following an earlier migration, it could explain how *H. erectus* were able to move so quickly across Asia.

A more unusual source of information on when hominins first left Africa comes from the parasites that accompanied them. All hominoids are plaqued by lice, but humans host a distinct species, Pediculus humanus. Geneticist David Reed and his colleagues found that *P. humanus* diverged from other lice about 5.6 million years agoâ€”about the time the first hominins appeared. More interesting, however, Reed and colleagues discovered that there are two subspecies of *P. humanus* that appear to have diverged about 1.2 million years ago. One subspecies is found worldwide today; the other is restricted to the New World. Reed and colleagues suggest this is evidence that at least some hominin migrants (probably H. erectus) became isolated in Asia by at least 1.2 million years ago, where their lice diverged from that of other hominin populations, only to be picked up much later by modern human migrants who ended up colonizing the New World.

So, who were the first hominin migrants? They may have been H. habilis, or they may have been very early *H. erectus*. When did the first hominin migrations out of Africa take place? Probably slightly less than 2 million years ago, but once these hominins left, they moved quickly, and they moved long distances. By 1.6 million years ago, *H. erectus* was in both western and southern Asia, and by 1.2 million years ago, their populations had moved far enough to have become isolated from one another. Whether or not they were the first migrants out of Africa, H. erectus migrated fast and far.

sites-Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania and the Lake Turkana region of Kenya. An almost complete skeleton of a boy was found at Nariokotome, on the western side of Lake Turkana, dating from about 1.6 million years ago. The Olduvai finds are from about 1.2 million years ago.<sup>42</sup>

### **Physical Characteristics of Homo erectus**

The *Homo erectus* skull generally was long, low, and thickly walled, with a flat frontal area and prominent browridges. It had a unique pentagonal shape when looked at from the back, formed in part by a rounded ridge, called a **sagittal keel**, running along the crest of the skull. There was also a ridge of bone running horizontally along the back of the skull, called an occipital torus, which added to the skull's overall long shape (see Figure  $7.7$ ).<sup>43</sup>

Compared with early *Homo*, *H. erectus* had relatively small teeth. *Homo erectus* was the first hominin to have third molars that were smaller than the second or first molars, as in modern humans. The molars also had an enlarged pulp cavity, called **taurodontism**, which may have allowed the teeth to withstand harder use and wear than the teeth of modern humans. But the  $H$ . *erectus* jaw was lighter and thinner than in either early *Homo* or the australopithecines, and the face was less **prognathic**, or forward thrusting, in the upper and lower jaw.

The brain, averaging  $895-1,040$  cc, was larger than that found in any of the australopithecines or early *Homo* species but smaller than the average brain of a modern human.<sup>44</sup> Endocasts, which provide a picture of the surface of the brain, suggest that it was organized more like the brain of modern humans than like those of australopithecines.

similarly open, dry environment.<sup>47</sup> *Homo erectus* was also less sexually dimorphic than either the australopithecines or early  $Homo$ . The degree of sexual dimorphism in  $H$ . *erectus* was comparable to that in modern humans.

Those scholars who group the African populations into a distinct species, *Homo ergaster*, point to several differences between them and other *Homo erectus* populations: The cranial proportions differ in *Homo ergaster*; the browridge is thinner and is arched above each of the eye sockets; the eye sockets are more rounded; and the face is oriented more vertically below the skull, among others. On the other hand, some scholars believe that the differences between *Homo erectus* and modern humans are not large enough to be identified as differ-

![](_page_13_Figure_7.jpeg)

ent species, and they argue that *Homo erectus* populations should be lumped into *Homo sapiens*.<sup>48</sup> These arguments will not be settled any time soon, and here we will stick with the single taxon *Homo erectus*.

#### Homo floresiensis

Whether or not there are distinct African and Asian species of *Homo erectus*, most scholars agree that *Homo floresiensis* is a distinct species that is closely related to Homo erectus. H. floresiensis has only been found on the Indonesian island of Flores, and only a handful of individuals have been located to date. All are tiny (they stood perhaps three feet tall) and have very small brains, on the order of  $380 \text{ cc.}^{49}$  The structure of the brain, however, seems closely related to that of  $H$ . *erectus*, as do the structures of the skull.<sup>50</sup> In other words, H. floresiensis appears to be a tiny version of *H. erectus*. *H. floresiensis* even made tools that look similar to those made by  $H$ . erectus, and in some cases the tools look even more sophisticated. So, although they were small in stature and had very small brains, H. floresiensis seems to have been culturally and intellectually similar to  $H$ . erectus.<sup>51</sup>

*Homo erectus* had a prominent, projecting nose, in contrast to the australopithecines' flat, nonprojecting nose.<sup>45</sup> From the neck down, H. erectus was practically indistinguishable from *H. sapiens*. In contrast to the smaller australopithecines and early *Homo* species who lived in East Africa around the same time, H. erectus was comparable to modern humans in size. The almost complete skeleton of the boy at Nariokotome suggests that he was about  $5\frac{1}{2}$ feet tall and about 8 years of age when he died; researchers estimate that he would have been over 6 feet tall had he lived to maturity. About 1.6 million years ago, the Nariokotome region was probably open grassland, with trees mostly along rivers.<sup>46</sup> Homo erectus in East Africa was similar in size to Africans today who live in a

The body of *Homo floresiensis* also seems to resemble *Homo erectus*, or perhaps even *Homo habilis*. The wrist of *H. floresiensis* is not like that of modern humans or Neandertals but resembles that of the great apes and australopithecines (unfortunately, no wrists of *H. erectus* or *H. habilis* have been found, so no comparison can be made to them).52 Similarly, the foot of *H. floresiensis* resembles that of *H. erectus* and earlier hominins more than that of modern humans.53 Once again, *H. floresiensis* appears to be a tiny version of *H. erectus*.

How might a miniature version of *H. erectus* have evolved? The answer is that both dwarfism and gigantism are common phenomena in isolated populations. Dwarfism appears to be an adaptation that occurs when there are few predatorsâ€”a species in isolation can become smaller, and have a large population, if there are no predators threatening them. This may be what happened on Flores.54 It is interesting that the island also hosted a number

skulls. Note how small *H. floresiensis* is compared to a modern human.

of dwarf species in addition to *H. floresiensis*, including a dwarf elephant that appears to have been one of the favorite foods of *H. floresiensis*. Perhaps even more interesting is the fact that *H. floresiensis* may have survived until as recently as 12,000 years agoâ€”well into the time period when modern humans were living in Indonesia. Could modern humans and the tiny *H. floresiensis* have met some time in the distant past? It is an intriguing possibility, but there is no evidence to tell us.

### The Evolution of *Homo erectus*

The evolution of *Homo erectus* reflects a continuation of the general evolutionary trends we discussed previously. The brain continued to expand, increasing more than a third over early *Homo* (just as early *Homo* had increased more than a third over the australopithecines). The face, teeth, and jaws continued to shrink, taking on an almost modern form. An increasing use and variety of tools may have led to a further development of the brain. *Homo erectus* was eating and probably cooking meat, and this may have led to further reduction in the teeth and jaws.

One additional change in *Homo erectus* is an apparent reduction in the extent of sexual dimorphism to almost modern levels. The australopithecines and early *Homo* were quite sexually dimorphic. *Homo erectus* does not appear to be as sexually dimorphic as these earlier hominins. What might have caused this change? In other primates, sexual dimorphism appears to be linked to social systems in which males are at the top of dominance hierarchies due to physical size and prowess, and such males control sexual access to multiple females in the group. In contrast, lack of sexual dimorphism seems most pronounced in the animals where *pair bonding* existsâ€”that is, where a male and a female form a breeding pair that lasts for a long period of time (there are several distinct variations of male-female bonding in modern human cultures).55 Could male-female bonding have developed in *Homo erectus*? It seems possible.

Recall that early *Homo* may have established some of the basic elements of human culture, including home bases or meeting places, family groups, and sharing. Another basic element of recent human culture, one that is present in almost all known cultures, is *marriage*. Marriage is a socially recognized sexual and economic bond between two individuals, typically a male and a female, that is intended to continue throughout the lifetimes of the individuals and to produce socially accepted children. It is a specific kind of pair bond with a set of behaviors, expectations, and obligations that extend beyond the pair to those individuals' families. With marriage, then, the competition between males

for access to females may have diminished, lessening the importance of sexual dimorphism. But why might marriage have developed in *Homo erectus*?

In animal species where females can feed themselves and their babies after birth, pair bonding is rare. But in species where females cannot feed both themselves and their babies, pair bonding is common. Why? We think it is because a strong male-female bond provides a good solution to the problem of incompatibility between a mother's feeding requirements and tending a newborn baby. A male partner can bring food and/or watch the newborn while the mother gets food.56 But most primates lack pair bonding. This may be because primate infants are able to cling to their mother's fur soon after birth so that the mother's hands are free to forage. Human infants demonstrate a residual form of this innate ability to cling during their first

few weeks of life. This is called the *Moro reflex*. If a human infant feels it is falling backward, it will automatically stretch out its arms and clench its fists.57

We have no way of knowing if *Homo erectus* had fur like other primates, but we think probably not because we think they may have worn clothing, as we discuss later. The brain in *Homo erectus* may also have already expanded enough that *Homo erectus* infants, like modern human infants, could not adequately support their heads even if they could hold onto their mother's fur. In any case, when early hominins began to depend on scavenging and hunting for food (and for skins to be used in clothing), it would have been difficult and hazardous for a parent with a newborn baby to engage in these activities with a baby along. Marriage would have been an effective solution to this problem because each parent could help protect the baby while the other was away getting food. Another important aspect of the evolution of *Homo erectus* was the movement of populations out of eastern and southern Africa. As with the lessening of sexual dimorphism, it seems likely that cultural innovations were the key to allowing *Homo erectus* to move into new environments (see the box "How Do We Reconstruct Ancient Environments?"). Why? Because upon entering new environments, *Homo erectus* would have been faced with new (and generally colder) climatic conditions, new and different sources of raw material for tools, and new plants and animals to rely on for food. All animals adapt to such changes through natural selection, but natural selection typically takes a relatively long time and requires physical changes in the adapting organisms. *Homo erectus* was able to adapt to new environments very quickly and without apparent physical changes. This suggests that the primary mechanisms of adaptation for *Homo erectus* were cultural rather than biological.

What cultural adaptations might *Homo erectus* have made? Fire might have been the crucial cultural adaptation to colder climates. As we discuss later, there is tantalizing evidence that *Homo erectus* used fire. But fire can only warm people when they are stationary; it doesn't help when people are out collecting food. To be mobile in colder climates, *Homo erectus* may have begun to wear animal furs for warmth. Some *Homo erectus* tools look like the hide-processing tools used by more recent human groups,58 and it seems unlikely that *Homo erectus* could have survived in the colder locations where they have been found, in eastern Europe and Asia, without some form of clothing. And if *Homo erectus* was wearing furs for warmth, they must have been hunting. *Homo erectus* could not have depended on scavenging to acquire skinsâ€”the skin is the first thing predators destroy when they dismember a carcass. *Homo erectus* needing skins would have had to kill fur-bearing animals themselves if they wanted intact skins and furs for clothing.

Fossil remains themselves cannot provide evidence for whether or not *H. erectus* was hairless. But scientists have found that the genes of modern peoples may offer

## **Current Research and Issues**

#### How Do We Reconstruct Ancient Environments?

n important question arises when discussing hominin adaptations to the environment: How do we know what past environments were like? The answer is provided by the fields of paleobotany, paleozoology, and paleoclimatology. Let's take a look at each

Paleobotany uses plant remains found in archaeological and fossil sites to identify the range of flora in a location at a given point in time. These plant remains usually include preserved seeds, pollen, and phytoliths, which are small pieces of silicon that develop between plant cells. Phytoliths are unique to particular plant species, and since they are essentially small rocks, they preserve very well. Plants can also fossilize. By looking at all these types of plant remains, paleobotanists can often provide a very clear picture of the flora that once existed in a given area.

Paleozoologists examine the animal remains and fossils from sites to determine the types of animals that once inhabited a given location. Many of the more important animals are small-rodents, reptiles, snails, and the like, which are highly sensitive to environmental changes. Like plants, animals are adapted to particular environments, so the animals found can give a clear indication of past environments.

Paleoclimatologists use evidence provided by paleobotanists and paleozoologists to develop a basic picture of the climate that once existed in a given area (since particular plants and animals live in particular types of climates) but also employ unique evidence of their own. One type of evidence is the growth rings on trees, which are thicker when there is more rainfall and thinner when there is less. For more global climate reconstructions, scholars look to the materials trapped in glacial ice cores, deep sea sediments, and cave speleothems to provide information on the composition of the atmosphere.

Combining all this information, scholars can develop a fairly accurate picture of what the environment in a

given area was like at a given point in time and can also trace environmental change over time.

clues to when our ancestors became hairless. For example, one of the primary genes responsible for hair and skin color, called MC1R, demonstrates uniformity among modern dark-skinned African populations but diversity among non-Africans. Alan Rogers and colleagues have recently argued that the uniformity in this gene among Africans demonstrates recent, powerful selective pressure in favor of darker skin and that protection against the tropical sun after the loss of body hair is the likely reason. When did this selective pressure start? Rogers and colleagues estimate it was at least 1.2 million years ago.<sup>59</sup>

It is interesting to consider that, in eastern Africa, *Homo erectus* coexisted with at least one other species of hominin (*P. boisei*) and possibly with as many as three others (P. boisei, A. africanus, and H. habilis/rudolfensis). Why did Homo erectus survive and flourish while these other species went extinct? Again, culture may be the answer. A. boisei seems to have been a specialized grasslands species. Their large molars and powerful dental architecture would have allowed them to eat tough grasses and other coarse materials that other hominins could not chew. However, they had to compete with the many other grassland animals that also relied on these plants but reproduced faster and had speed to help them escape from predators. Early *Homo* was apparently a tool user and relied at least in part on scavenging and hunting, but compared to *Homo erectus*, early *Homo* technology was crude and early *Homo* populations may not have been as well organized to scavenge, hunt, and defend themselves against predators. These differences in culture may have provided advantages to *Homo erectus* that drove early *Homo* to extinction.

This scenario, just like the one we suggested for the evolution of early *Homo*, is a "justso" story that may or may not be true. But it does fit the facts we now have about *Homo erectus* and the area in which it evolved. Regardless of this story's particular details, there seems to be no doubt that the development of a more complex culture was vital to the evolution of *Homo erectus*.

7.6 Identify features of Lower Paleolithic cultures.

#### **Lower Paleolithic** The

period of the Oldowan and Acheulian stone tool traditions.

#### **Acheulian** A stone

toolmaking tradition dating from 1.5 million years ago. Compared with the Oldowan tradition, Acheulian assemblages have more large tools created according to standardized designs or shapes. One of the most characteristic and prevalent tools in the Acheulian tool kit is the so-called hand axe, which is a teardrop-shaped bifacially flaked tool with a thinned sharp tip. Other large tools might have been cleavers and picks.

**Hand axe** A teardropshaped stone tool characteristic of Acheulian assemblages.

**Soft hammer** A technique of stone tool manufacture in which a bone or wood hammer is used to strike flakes from a stone.

**Hard hammer** A technique of stone tool manufacture where one stone is used to knock flakes from another stone. Flakes produced through hard hammer percussion are usually large and crude.

## Lower Paleolithic Cultures

The stone tool traditions of *Homo erectus* are traditionally called **Lower Paleolithic**. These stone tool traditions involve core tool techniques, in which a core of stone, rather than a flake, is used as the basic raw material for finished tools (we will talk more about Lower Paleolithic stone tool technology shortly). Because stone tools are the most common cultural material in the archaeological record of these ancient peoples, the entire culture of *Homo erectus* is often termed *Lower Paleolithic*, a practice we follow here.

The archaeological finds of tools and other cultural artifacts dating from 1.5 million years to about 200,000 years ago are assumed to have been produced by *Homo erectus*. But hominin fossils are not usually associated with these materials. Therefore some of the tools during this period were possibly produced by hominins other than *H. erectus*, such as australopithecines earlier and *H. sapiens* later. But the so-called *Acheulian* tool assemblages dating from 1.5 million years ago to more than a million years later are very similar to each other, and *H. erectus* is the only hominin that spans the entire period. Thus, it is conventionally assumed that *H. erectus* was responsible for most if not all of the Acheulian tool assemblages we describe.60

#### The Acheulian Tool Tradition

The stone toolmaking tradition known as the **Acheulian** was named after the site at St. Acheul, France, where the first examples were found. But the oldest Acheulian tools recovered are from East Africa, on the Peninj River, Tanzania, dating back about 1.5 million years.61 In contrast to Oldowan, Acheulian assemblages have more large tools created according to standardized designs or shapes. Oldowan tools have sharp edges made by a few blows. Acheulian toolmakers shaped the stone by knocking more flakes off most of the edges. Many of these tools were made from very large flakes that had first been struck from very large cores or boulders.

One of the most characteristic and common tools in the Acheulian tool kit is the socalled **hand axe**, which is a teardrop-shaped, bifacially flaked tool with a thinned sharp tip. Other large tools resemble cleavers and picks. There were also many kinds of flake tools, such as scrapers with a wide edge.

Early Acheulian tools appeared to have been made by blows with a hard stone, but later tools are wider and flatter and may have been made with a **soft hammer** of bone or antler.62 This soft-hammer technique of making stone tools was an important innovation. Tools made by a **hard hammer** technique, rock against rock, have limits in terms of their sharpness and form because only large and thick flakes can be made with a hard-hammer technique (unless the flintknapper is very skillful and the stone being used has unique qualities). Flakes created by soft-hammer flaking are much thinner and longer than hardhammer flakes, and the flintknapper generally has better control over their size and shape. This means that thinner and sharper tools can be made, as well as tools with complex shapes. Hand axes can be made with either technique, as their shape is simple, but those made using a soft hammer have much thinner and sharper edges.63

Were hand axes made for chopping trees, as their name suggests? We cannot be sure what they were used for, but experiments with them suggest that they are not good for cutting trees; they seem more suited for butchering large animals.64 Lawrence Keeley microscopically examined some Acheulian hand axes, and the wear on them is more consistent with animal butchery. They may also have been used for woodworking, particularly hollowing and shaping wood, and they are also good for digging.65 William Calvin has even suggested that a hand axe could be used as a projectile thrown like a discus into a herd of animals in the hope of injuring or killing an animal.<sup>66</sup>

Acheulian tools are found widely in Africa, Europe, and western Asia, but bifacial hand axes, cleavers, and picks are not found as commonly in eastern and southeastern Asia.67 Because *H. erectus* has been found in all areas of the Old World, it is puzzling that the tool traditions seem to differ from west to east. Some archaeologists have suggested that large bifacial tools may be lacking in eastern and southeastern Asia because *H. erectus* in Asia had a better material to make tools out ofâ€”bamboo. Bamboo has been used recently in Southeast Asia for many purposes, including incredibly sharp arrows and sticks for digging and cutting. Geoffrey Pope has shown that bamboo is found precisely in those areas of Asia where hand axes and other large bifacial tools are largely missing.68

### Big Game Eating

Some of the Acheulian sites have produced evidence of big game eating. F. Clark Howell, who excavated sites at Torralba and Ambrona, Spain, found a substantial number of elephant remains and unmistakable evidence of human presence in the form of tools. Howell suggests that the humans at those sites used fire to frighten elephants into muddy bogs from which they would be unable to escape.69 To hunt elephants in this way, the humans would have had to plan and work cooperatively in fairly large groups.

But do these finds of bones of large- and medium-sized animals, in association with tools, tell us that the humans definitely were big game hunters? Some archaeologists who have reanalyzed the evidence from Torralba think that the big game may have been scavenged. Because the Torralba and Ambrona sites are near ancient streams, many of the elephants could have died naturally, their bones accumulating in certain spots because of the flow of water.70 What seems fairly clear is that the humans did deliberately butcher different kinds of gameâ€”different types of tools are found with different types of animals.71 Thus, whether the humans hunted big game at Torralba and Ambrona is debatable; all we can be sure of, as of now, is that they consumed big game and probably hunted smaller game.

#### Control of Fire

One way in which *H. erectus* is thought to have hunted is by using *fire drives*â€”a technique still used by hunting and gathering peoples in recent times. It is highly effective: Animals are driven out of their hiding places and homes by fire and dispatched by hunters positioned downwind of the oncoming flames. Most peoples who use this technique today set fires deliberately, but fires caused by lightning strikes may have also been utilized. Did *H. erectus* set these fires? Because *H. erectus* was the first hominin to be found throughout the Old World and in areas with freezing winters, most anthropologists presume that *H. erectus* had learned to control fire, at least for warmth. There is archaeological evidence of fire in some early sites, but fires can be natural events. Thus, whether fire was under deliberate control by *H. erectus* is not definitely established.72

Suggestive but not conclusive evidence of the deliberate use of fire comes from Wonderwerk Cave in South Africa and dates to over 1.7 million years ago.73 More persuasive evidence of human control of fire, dating from nearly 800,000 years ago, comes from the site of Gesher Benot Ya'aqov in Israel. Here, researchers found evidence of burned seeds, wood, and stone as well as concentrations of burned items suggestive of hearths.74 Evidence of the deliberate use of fire comes from Europe somewhat later. Unfortunately, the evidence of control of fire at Gesher Benot Ya'aqov and European sites is not associated with *H. erectus* fossils, so the link between deliberate use of fire and *H. erectus* cannot definitely be established yet.75 The lack of clear evidence does not, of course, mean that *H. erectus* did not use fire. After all, *H. erectus* did move into cold areas of the world, and it is hard to imagine how that could have happened without the deliberate use of fire. Such a move is also hard to imagine if *H. erectus* were relatively hairless and did not get warm skins and furs from hunting.

Clothing, therefore, may have been necessary, but fire might have been even more important, and not only for warmth. Cooking would be possible. The control of fire was a major step in increasing the energy under human control. Cooking would have made all kinds of food (not just meat) more safely digestible and therefore more usable.76 Fires would also have kept predators away, a not inconsiderable advantage given that there were many.

![](_page_19_Picture_1.jpeg)

*Homo erectus* ateâ€”and probably huntedâ€”large game animals, and they probably also learned to control fire.

#### Campsites

Acheulian sites were usually located close to water sources, lush vegetation, and large stocks of herbivorous animals. Some camps have been found in caves, but most were in open areas surrounded by rudimentary fortifications or windbreaks. Several African sites are marked by stony rubble brought there by *H. erectus*, possibly for the dual purpose of securing the windbreaks and providing ammunition in case of a sudden attack.<sup>77</sup>

The presumed base campsites display a wide variety of tools, indicating that the camp was the center of many group functions. More specialized sites away from camp have also been found. These are marked by the predominance of a particular type of tool. For example, a butchering site in Tanzania contained dismembered hippopotamus carcasses and rare heavy-duty smashing and cutting tools. Workshops are another kind of specialized site encountered with some regularity. They are characterized by tool debris and are located close to a source of natural stone suitable for toolmaking.78

A camp has been excavated at the Terra Amata site near Nice, on the French Riviera. The camp appears to have been occupied in the late spring or early summer, judging by the pollen found in fossilized human feces. The excavator describes stake holes driven into the sand, paralleled by lines of stones, presumably marking the spots where the people constructed huts of roughly 30 feet by 15 feet (see Figure 7.9). A basic feature of each hut was a central hearth that seems to have been protected from drafts by a small wall built just outside the northeast corner of the hearth. The evidence suggests that the Terra Amata occupants gathered seafood, such as oysters and mussels, did some fishing, and hunted in the surrounding area. The animal remains suggest that they obtained both small and large animals but mostly got the young of larger animals such as stags, elephants, boars, rhinoceroses, and wild oxen. Some of the huts contain recognizable toolmakers' areas, scattered with tool debris; occasionally, the impression of an animal skin shows where the toolmaker actually sat.79

### Religion and Ritual

Thus far, we have discussed the lifestyles of the Lower Paleolithic, but we have not talked about the less material aspects of life, such as religion and ritual. What beliefs did *Homo erectus* hold about the world around them? Did they take part in rituals? Did *H. erectus* have religion? The data we have to answer these questions are limited, but there are some hints that ritual and religion may have been a part of Lower Paleolithic culture.

Remains of *red ochre* (oxidized clay) have been found on a number of Lower Paleolithic sites.80 This may be significant because in many later cultures, even modern ones, red ochre has been used in rituals of various types to represent blood or, more generally, life. Ochre seems to be particularly important in burial rituals, and human remains sprinkled with red ochre have been found in many parts of the world, dating as far back as the Middle Paleolithic (about 200,000 years ago). However, there is no evidence that *Homo erectus* buried their dead nor any evidence that ochre was used in rituals. It may have been used for body decoration or simply for protection against insects or sunburn.

More significant, and even more controversial, is the suggestion made by the excavators of Zhoukoudian (in northern China) that some of the *H. erectus* remains there showed evidence of ritual cannibalism.81 The foramen magnum of some specimens had been deliberately enlarged and the facial bones had been deliberately broken away from the cranium on others. A possible reason may have been to remove the brain for ritual consumption. Ritual cannibalism has been widely reported among living peoples, so its presence among ancient peoples is not impossible. But scholars point out that the parts of the skull that seem to have been purposely enlarged (to remove the brain) are those that are also the weakest points on the skull, and they may have broken away because of decay or disturbance over the millennia.

At this point, we simply cannot say whether religion and ritual were parts of Lower Paleolithic culture.

# Summary and Review

### Early Hominin Tools

#### 7.1 Describe early hominin tools.

- â€¢ The earliest identifiable stone tools found come from East Africa and date from about 2.5 million years ago but reveal little information about culture.
- â€¢ Among later tools from Olduvai beds in Tanzania, flake tools predominate, but choppers are also common. These early stone tools are referred to as Oldowan.

What describes and differentiates flake and chopper tools?

### Early Hominin Lifestyles

7.2 Describe early hominin lifestyles.

- â€¢ Dating to about 2 million years ago, archaeologists find sites with concentrations of stone tools and animal bones. Archaeologists have shown that Oldowan tools can be used for slitting hides, dismembering animals, whittling wood, and cutting branches.
- â€¢ Hominins were likely cutting up animal carcasses shortly after 2 million years ago. Most sites in Olduvai Gorge appear to have been home bases or food processing places.
- â€¢ The presence of patterned stone tools and possible home bases suggests that early hominins had cultureâ€”a dynamic, adaptive process of learned, shared, and integrated behaviors and ideas.
- â€¢ The early *Homo* brain was almost one-third larger than the australopithecine brain. Brain expansion may have required reduced maturity at birth and prolonged infant dependency, likely influencing cultural evolution.

How did larger brain size affect the life styles of the early hominins?

### Trends in Hominin Evolution

7.3 Identify the main trends in hominin evolution.

â€¢ Physical changes in early hominins that led to the evolution of our genus, *Homo*, include the expansion of the brain; the widening of the female pelvis to allow birth of bigger-brained babies; and the reduction of the face, teeth, and jaws.

â€¢ Increased brain size may be linked to the emergence of stone tool making and possibly to life in complex social groups. Expansion of the brain and reduction of the face occurred at about the same time and were probably related.

How did reductions in the teeth, face, and jaws of early hominins affect their life styles?

### Early *Homo*

7.4 Describe early *Homo* species.

- â€¢ *Homo habilis* and *Homo rudolfensis*, from about 2.3 million years ago, have larger brains and smaller faces and teeth than other contemporary (and earlier) hominins.
- â€¢ Early *Homo* appears to have used tools and scavenged or possibly hunted meat. The evolution of cultural behavior also seems to have played a role in physical changes.

How do *Homo habilis* and *Homo rudolfensis* differ from each other and from earlier hominins?

### *Homo erectus*

- 7.5 Explain the evolution of *Homo erectus*.
- â€¢ *Homo erectus* emerged about 1.8 million to 1.6 million years ago. It had a larger brain capacity than *Homo habilis* and an essentially modern skeleton. What differentiates *H. erectus* most from modern humans is the long, low skull with prominent browridges.
- â€¢ *Homo erectus* was the first hominin species to be widely distributed in the Old World. Some scholars reserve *Homo erectus* for those populations living outside of Africa and call the African populations *Homo ergaster*.
- â€¢ Another species of hominin lived at this time: *Homo floresiensis*, a miniature form of *Homo erectus* found only on an island in Indonesia.

- â€¢ As *Homo erectus* evolved, brain size increased, tooth and jaw size decreased, and tool use increased. Sexual dimorphism decreased, perhaps explained by pair bonding patterns.
- â€¢ *Homo erectus* was able to adapt to new environments very quickly and without apparent physical changes, which suggests that the species' primary mechanisms of adaptation were cultural.

How does *Homo erectus* differ from *Homo habilis*?

### Lower Paleolithic Cultures

7.6 Identify features of Lower Paleolithic cultures.

â€¢ The stone tool traditions of *Homo erectus* are traditionally called Lower Paleolithic cultures. Lower Paleolithic tools and other cultural artifacts from about 1.6 million to about 200,000 years ago were probably produced by *H. erectus*.

- â€¢ The most well-known tool tradition of this period is called Acheulian. Acheulian tools include small flake tools, but hand axes and large bifacial tools are characteristic.
- â€¢ Evidence indicates that *H. erectus* ate big game but there is no definitive evidence that they hunted big game. Similarly, although *H. erectus* possibly used fire to survive in colder areas, no direct evidence confirms that *H. erectus* controlled fire.

What are the main differences between Oldowan and Acheulean tools?

# Think on it

- 1. Why might early hominins have begun to make stone tools? How would stone tools have been more useful than wood or bone tools?
- 2. How do the physical changes that occur in early hominins correlate with the apparent changes in their behavior?
- 3. When compared to earlier hominins, *H. erectus* is larger, has a larger brain, and smaller teeth. How might these physical changes correlate with apparent behavioral changes in *H. erectus*?
- 4. *H. erectus* lived throughout the Old World. What may have enabled them to spread so widely?
