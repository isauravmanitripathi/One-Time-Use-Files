When we think of economics, we think of things and activities involving money. We think of the costs of goods and services, such as food, rent, haircuts, and movie tickets. We may also think of factories, farms, and other enterprises that produce the goods and services we need, or think we need. Inevitably, we think about the economy as a system that employs people to produce goods and services in exchange for wages. Workers in industrial societies may stand before a moving belt for eight hours, tightening identical bolts that glide by. In a post-industrial society, workers more likely provide a knowledge-based service, such as computer programming. In either case, people receive money, a symbol of the value placed on a commodity or a service, in exchange for the tasks they perform. The bits of colored paper and coins we call cash—or, as is more often the case today, the value on the checks or plastic cards that stand in for the colored paper-may be exchanged for food, shelter, and other goods and services.

Yet many societies—indeed, most cultures known to anthropology—did not have money or the equivalent of the factory worker until relatively recently. Still, all societies have economic systems, whether or not they involve money. All societies have customs specifying how people gain access to natural resources; customary ways of transforming or converting those resources, through labor, into necessities and other desired goods and services; and customs for distributing and perhaps exchanging goods and services. Many aspects of a culture, including family and kinship groups, the political system, and the presence or absence of inequality based on social class or gender, affect the form its economy takes. However, the major factor in variations among economic systems is the way in which each society gets its food. In this chapter, we shall look at traditional economic systems according to their food-getting strategies before turning to recent local and global changes.

In the earlier days of anthropology, it was easier to study the economic system of a people in relative isolation from other societies. But today, nearly every society on earth has felt the impact of global political and economic forces. Because of the influence of colonialism, imperialism, and capitalism, most people have had no choice but to become part of the world market system, even though the degree to which societies have accepted or resisted outside influences has varied considerably. Moreover, no society is immune to change. Even people who have resisted external economic forces to live in traditional economic systems have undergone change over the last few centuries.

16.1 Compare and contrast the allocation of resources among foragers, horticulturalists, intensive agriculturalists, and pastoralists, and discuss how colonialism and the state has affected that allocation.

## The Allocation of Resources

Every society has access to natural resources—land, water, plants, animals, minerals—and every society has cultural rules for determining who has access to particular resources and what can be done with them. In societies like the United States, which have private property systems, people buy and sell land and many other things. Land is divided into precisely measurable units, the borders of which may be recorded in a municipal land register. Individuals usually own relatively small plots of land and the resources that exist on them. Generally, large plots of land are collective property. The owner may be a family, a corporation, or a government agency, such as the National Park Service, which owns socalled public land on behalf of the entire population. In the United States, property ownership entails the exclusive right to use land or other resources in whatever legal ways the owner wishes, including the right to withhold or prevent use by others. In many societies, including the United States, property owners also have the right to "alienate" property that is, to sell, give away, bequeath, or destroy the resources owned.

Societies specify what they consider property and the rights and duties associated with that property.<sup>1</sup> Because conceptions of property are social in nature, they may change over time. For example, the French government retroactively made all of the country's beaches public, thereby declaring that the ocean shore is not a resource that an individual can own. As a result, all the hotel owners and individuals who had fenced-off portions of the

best beaches for their exclusive use had to remove the barriers. Even in countries like the United States, which has a strong private property system, people cannot do anything they want with their property. Like many other governments around the world, the U.S. government has the right of *eminent domain:* It may take land for use in the construction of a highway or another purpose that serves "the greater public good." The state compensates owners, but individuals cannot prevent confiscation. The notion that the individual property owner has obligations to the greater good of the society is behind other laws. For example, it has long been illegal in the United States to burn down your house or to use it as a brothel or a munitions arsenal. More recently, federal, state, and local governments have adopted legislation that prevents property owners from undertaking activities that pollute the air and the water supply.

#### Natural Resources: Land

Societies differ in their rules for access to land. Anthropologists have found that the differences generally relate to a society's food-getting method. Let us now examine how foragers, horticulturalists, pastoralists, and intensive agriculturalists structure rights to land in different ways. We look at traditional patterns first. As we shall see later, state societies that have colonized native societies in the New World, Africa, and Asia have had a considerable impact on traditional rights to land.

Foragers Individuals in food-collecting societies generally do not own land. Nor do they buy or sell land, probably because what is valued in foraging is the game and wild plant life on the land, not the land itself. The foraging Hadza of Tanzania, for example, believe that they do not have exclusive rights over the land on which they hunt. Members of the group can hunt, gather, or draw water wherever they like.2 Nor do the Hadza defend the territories they use from outsiders—that is, members of other language groups. But the Hadza are somewhat unusual. Collective ownership by groups of related people (kinship groups) or by territorial groups (bands or villages) is common among foragers. If game migrates away and the supply of plant foods dwindles, the land is of no use to a forager. Where the wild food supply is likely to fluctuate, communal ownership of a large tract of land is more desirable than individually owned small parcels of land.

This is not to say that private ownership of land does not exist among foragers. Among foragers heavily dependent on fishing in rivers, individual or family ownership is more common,<sup>3</sup> perhaps because fishing in rivers is more predictable than other kinds of foraging. And, in some foraging societies, individuals and families have private rights to trees.<sup>4</sup> Although foragers generally do not have private ownership of important land resources, there is considerable variation in the extent of communal ownership. It is more common in food-collecting societies for a group of individuals, usually kin, to "own" land. To be sure, such ownership is not usually exclusive; typically, some degree of access is provided to members of neighboring bands.5

At the other extreme, local groups try to maintain exclusive rights to particular territories. Why have some foragers been more territorial than others? One suggestion is that, when the plants and animals collected are predictably located and abundant, groups are more likely to be sedentary and to try to maintain exclusive control over territories. In contrast, when plant and animal resources are unpredictable in location or amount, territoriality will tend to be minimal.6 Territorial foragers appear to have predictably located resources *and* live in more permanent villages, so it is hard to know which factor is more important in determining whether territory will be defended.

Horticulturalists Like foragers, most horticulturalist individuals and families do not own land. Their lack of interest in laying claim to the land may be explained by the dynamics of subsistence farming. Using simple tools and no fertilizers other than the ash they create when they slash and burn vegetation to clear a field, most horticulturalists must periodically move on to other farmable land because they have depleted the soil in one area of its nutrients. Individuals or families have little incentive to claim permanent access to land that, given the technology available to them, they cannot use permanently. Nevertheless, horticulturalist societies are more likely than foraging societies to assign the use of particular plots of land to individuals or families.

![](_page_3_Picture_1.jpeg)

The Kamayura of the Xingu region of the Amazon practice slash-and-burn horticulture. The rain forest is in the background.

For example, among the Mundurucú of Brazil, the village controls the rights to use land. People in the community can hunt and fish where they like, and they have the right to clear a garden plot wherever communal land is not being used. Gardens may be cultivated for only two years before the soil is exhausted; then the land reverts to the community. The Mundurucú distinguish between the land and the produce on the land; the produce belongs to the person who cultivates it. Similarly, the person who kills an animal or catches a fish owns it, no matter where it was obtained, even if he or she will later be expected to share the bounty.

Individual rights to land arose among the Mundurucú when they moved beyond subsistence to marketable products: the men began to tap rubber trees and sell the natural latex they harvested. Rights to a particular forest path of tapped trees could be inherited by a son or a son-in-law, but they could not be bought and sold.<sup>7</sup>

Pastoralists The territory of pastoral nomads usually far exceeds that of most horticultural societies. Because their wealth ultimately depends on mobile herds, uncultivated pasture for grazing, and water for drinking, pastoralists often combine the adaptive habits of both foragers and horticulturalists. Like foragers, they generally need to know the potential of a large area of land. The pastoral Basseri of Iran, for example, moved over

an area of 15,000 square miles to obtain supplies of grass and water. Like horticulturalists, pastoralists must move on when they have exhausted a resource. In their case, the resource is grass, which must renew itself after extensive grazing.

Because land is only good if there is sufficient pasture and water, there would be considerable risk to individuals or families to own land that did not predictably have grass and water. Therefore, like most foragers and horticulturalists, members of pastoralist communities generally have free access to pasture land.<sup>8</sup> While they tend to hold grazing land communally, pastoralists customarily own their herds individually.<sup>9</sup> Fredrik Barth argued that, if animals were not privately owned, the entire group might be in trouble because the members might be tempted to eat up their productive capital—their animals—in bad times. On the other hand, when a family owns its herd and the herd drops below the minimum number of animals necessary for survival, the family can drop out of nomadic life, at least temporarily, and work for wages in sedentary agricultural communities. In so doing, one family does not jeopardize other pastoral families. On the other hand, if the fortunate were to share their herds with the unfortunate, all might approach bankruptcy. Thus, Barth argued, individual ownership is adaptive for a pastoral way of life.<sup>10</sup>

John Dowling questioned whether private ownership is an inducement to save for future production. As he pointed out, pastoral nomads are not the only ones who have to save some of their "crop" for future production. Horticulturalist societies also must save some of their crop, in the form of seeds or tubers, for future planting, and manage to do so even though they generally lack private ownership of productive resources. Dowling suggested that private ownership develops only in pastoral societies that depend on selling their products to non-pastoralists.11 Thus, it may be the opportunity to sell their products, as well as their labor, that explains both the possibility of dropping out of nomadic life and the private ownership of animals among most pastoralists.

## Current Research and Issues

#### Does Communal Ownership Lead to Economic Disaster?

I n a controversial paper called "The Tragedy of the Commons," ecologist Garrett Hardin suggested that herders make an economically rational decision by grazing more animals than a pasture can sustain when they use common land—he would later explain that he meant *unregulated* common land. Economic logic dictates, according to Hardin, that herders have more to gain from owning more livestock than they have to lose by overgrazing land they do not own, since they are not accountable for the land. The tragedy Hardin saw results when overgrazing degrades pastureland to the point where herders can no longer sustain their herds. In the trade-off between self-interest and environmental destruction, Hardin also included water supplies, the air, and the oceans. He believed that a fisher is likely to take as many fish as possible from the ocean, a kind of commons, and not worry about the consequences. On the other hand, Harden argued, individuals might try to conserve natural resources if they own them, because they make an equally rational economic calculation that degrading those resources will cost them over the long term by decreasing their yields. The theory, then, is that private owners will find it rational to conserve their resources to minimize costs and maximize yields.

Does the evidence support Hardin's theory? Does communal ownership tend to result in overexploitation of resources and lower yields, and private ownership tend to result in conservation of resources and higher yields? This question is an active area of research in economic anthropology. We do know about instances in which communal grazing lands have been more productive than private grazing lands in comparable climates. For example, the Borana of Ethiopia, who have communal grazing, produce more animal protein per acre at lower cost than Australian cattleranchers, even though their climates are similar. And there are instances, such as the overgrazing in the Great American Desert, where private ownership did lead to degradation of the environment.

Fishing people often have communal rights to places to fish as in this area of Zaire.

Commercialization may be more important than private versus communal ownership in explaining overgrazing or overfishing, at least initially. In the Micronesian islands of Palau, which had traditional conservation practices, serious overfishing became a problem apparently only when people started to sell fish to Japanese colonists for imported trade goods. Some of those goods (nets and motors) helped to make fishing easier. Eventually, overfishing resulted in reduced catches and increased costs of fishing, and the Palauans had to buy much of their fish in imported cans.

It may also be that sustainability requires some regulation by political authorities. Before 1995, the halibut fishery in Alaska was facing collapse. Competing fishers rushed to fill their holds, no matter how dangerous the weather. Because the fishers often overshot the industry quota, regulators shortened the fishing season to just a few days. And when the boats returned after a few days with a year's worth of fish, the market was flooded and prices fell. In 1995, business became better and safer after a system of "catch shares" was adopted. The fishers were each allocated a transferable quota that they could use to catch fish or sell to others. The quotas are a percentage

of the total allowable catch, which regulators set each year. Consequently, captains could plan when to fish without worrying about weather or being beaten to the schools of fish by other fishers, regulators could extend the fishing season, and prices for halibut climbed. The new regulatory system was a success. The halibut fishery was sustained and the fishers were better off. But regulation does not always work, judging by the "groundfishing" (fishing for fish, like cod, that feed off the ocean bottom) industry off the New England coast. In contrast to lobster fishermen who have accepted regulation, groundfishers have not. Perhaps this is because the groundfishing industry did not play a role in creating the regulations, nor does it have a cohesive community that can police itself.

Is there a lesson here for sustaining and even enhancing resources in general? If so, which is more likely to lead to conservation, communal ownership or private ownership? We cannot say yet with any confidence. We need more comparisons of cases to tell us. It may be that conservation can be fostered in either type of system, if the people involved are so motivated.

Like hunter-gatherers, pastoralist groups vary in the degree of ownership rights they possess to territories through which they move their animals. The Basseri have rights to pass through certain areas, including agricultural areas and even cities, but they do not own the entire territory upon which they depend. On the other hand, the Baluch, another pastoralist group in the border region between Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, claim a "tribal" territory, which they defend by force, if necessary.12

Intensive Agriculturalists Individual ownership of land resources—including the right to use the resources and the right to sell or otherwise dispose of them—is common among intensive agriculturalists. The development of sole ownership is partly the result of the potential to use land season after season, which gives it lasting value. The concept of individual ownership is also partly a political (and social policy) matter. The U.S. Congress, for example, transformed government-owned frontier land west of the Mississippi River into privately owned land shortly before the Civil War, when the South had seceded from the Union. Under the Homestead Act of 1862, if a person cleared a 160-acre piece of land and farmed it for five years, the federal government would consider that person the owner of the land. Aside from being a populist social policy, the act served other political goals: It preempted the westward spread of the large-scale Southern plantation farming that relied on slave labor and created a larger voting population, since only property owners could vote at the time. The Homestead Act is similar to the custom in some societies by which a kin group, a chief, or a community is obligated to assign a parcel of land to anyone who wishes to farm it. Unlike the farmer of such a parcel, once American homesteaders became landowners, the laws of the country gave them the right to dispose of it at will by selling or giving it away. Moreover, property owners could use their economic and hence political power to pass laws that favored themselves.

Intensive agriculture is not always associated with private ownership. Nor does it always occur in complex political systems that have differences in wealth and power. Some communist and socialist nations—politically complex systems that seek to diminish differences in wealth and power—undertook intensive agriculture by forming state-run agricultural collectives. For example, after World War II, the small farm holdings in Zamfirovo, a village in Bulgaria, were incorporated into a cooperative. Most of the villagers worked as laborers on the new cooperative, but the cooperative also allocated to every household a small plot on which to grow its own grain, vegetables, and grapes. Such plots were fairly productive, and Westerners have often attributed their productivity to private enterprise. But the cooperative in Zamfirovo, at least, provided much of the labor needed to plant and plow these plots, so their productivity could hardly have been the result of private enterprise alone. In 1989, after the overthrow of the communist regime, the cooperative was dissolved, and the land was divided and sold to private owners.13

Colonialism, the State, and Land Rights Almost universally around the world, colonial conquerors and settlers have taken land away from the natives or aborigines. Even if the natives were given other land in exchange, as in Brazil and the United States, these so-called reservations were often, if not always, poorer in potential than the original land. (If the reservation land had not been poorer in quality, the settlers might have taken possession of it for themselves.) In addition, the new centralized governments often tried to change how the natives owned the land, almost always in the direction of individual or private ownership. If kin groups or larger social entities owned the land, it would be more difficult for the new settlers to get the natives to give it up, either by sale or threat. Individual owners could be dispossessed more easily.<sup>14</sup>

The newcomers who benefited from these forced changes were not always people of European background, but they were commonly people from expanding state societies. Beginning in the late 15th century, the expanding groups came mostly from Western Europe. But in recent times, as well as in the millennia before and after the time of Christ, conquerors and settlers have come from India, China, Japan, Arabia, Scandinavia, Russia, and other countries. This is not to say that native peoples in Africa, Asia, and the New World were never guilty of conquering and exploiting others on their continents or elsewhere. They were. The Aztecs in Mexico and Central America, the native kingdoms in West Africa after about 800 years ago, and the Arabs after the rise of Islam were just some

of the expanding state societies of the past. Imperialism and colonialism have existed wherever there have been "civilized" (urban) societies. In North America, the British recognized the principle that lands not ceded to the crown would be native hunting grounds, but such recognition of rights by the British and then by the United States remained in force only as long as the various native groups remained numerous enough to constitute a threat to the settlers. President Andrew Jackson, for example, called for removal of all eastern Native American groups to "permanent" settlements west of the Mississippi. Some 90,000 people were removed. But, as settlers moved west, the reservations were often reduced in size.15

In much of colonial Africa, governments ceded land to European-owned companies for development. Reserves were established for large native populations, who then were invariably forced to work as laborers on European-owned plantations and in European-owned mines.16 For example, in the 19th century, the land of the pastoral Masai stretched from the Lake Turkana area of northern Kenya down to northern Tanzania. The British pushed the Masai onto a reserve in the southern part of Kenya, south of the Mombasa-Uganda railway, and gave some of their prime grazing lands and water resources near Nairobi, as well as near the Naivasha and Nakuru lakes, to Europeans for farming and ranching. (Nairobi, which was then the administrative center of the British protectorate, is now the capital of Kenya.) The Masai grazing land was reduced by about 60 percent, and the Masai were also forbidden to graze in the areas where game parks were established by the British for tourism.17 Europeans, who constituted less than 1 percent of the population in Kenya, acquired access to or control of 20 percent of the land, mostly in the highlands, where there was the greatest potential for commercial production of tea and coffee.18

The taking of land by state authorities does not happen with colonialism and imperialism alone. Indigenous revolutionary movements have collectivized land, as in Russia, or broken up large private landholdings, as in Mexico. Typically, state authorities do not like communal land-use systems, and they particularly view mobile pastoralists unfavorably, because their mobility makes them difficult to control. Governments usually try to settle pastoralists or break up communally held pasture into small units.19 In Kenya, for example, after independence from the British, the pastoral Masai continued to lose grazing territory. The post-colonial national government, which strongly promotes tourism, not only needed land for the game parks it considered vital but also undertook the construction of massive greenhouses to grow flowers for the European market. Whereas the flower industry has flourished—flowers are Kenya's major horticultural export today—Lake Naivasha, where many greenhouses are located, has been polluted and overused. The pastoral Masai have also suffered. With the advice of international development agencies, the Kenyan government pushed for privatization of grazing land. But grazing on individually owned plots requires capital to grow or buy food for cattle, pay for medicines, and get cattle to market.20

#### Technology

Every society has a *technology*, a set of practical tools and skills with which it converts resources into food and other goods. Technologies include tools (such as digging sticks and harpoons), constructions (such as nets and traps), and learned skills (such as how and where to set up a fish trap). The technologies used and the ways in which access to them is allotted vary considerably among societies. Foragers and pastoralists, for example, typically employ relatively small tool kits. They must limit their number of tools, and their material possessions in general, to what they can comfortably carry with them. Access to technology is generally available to all members of forager and horticultural societies.

In industrial or post-industrial societies, on the other hand, the opportunity to acquire or use a particular technology (which may be enormously expensive, as well as complex) is hardly available to all. Most of us may be able to buy a drill or a hammer, but only a few of us have acquired the skill to make such tools. Even fewer of us could buy the factory—the system of technologies—needed to make the tools. Likewise, some of us can bake delicious breads, but few of us have the access to technology or the skill needed to mill grains into the flour we need. Nor do we have the same need to learn such technologies, for we can exchange the products of our specialized skills for products from other specialists.

While forager and pastoralist societies generally lack specialized labor, most individuals in such societies learn the skills they need to convert resources into food and other goods. The tools foragers most need are weapons for the hunt, digging sticks, and receptacles for gathering and carrying. Of all foragers, the Inuit probably had the most sophisticated weapons, including harpoons, compound bows, and ivory fishhooks. Yet the Inuit also had relatively fixed settlements with available storage space and dog teams and sleds for transportation.21

Foragers consider tools to belong to the person who made them. There is no way of gaining superiority over others through the possession of tools, because whatever resources for toolmaking are available to one are available to all. In addition, the custom of sharing applies to tools as well as to food. Elizabeth Thomas, speaking of the !Kung, said, "The few possessions that Bushmen have are constantly circulating among the members of their groups."22

Pastoralists, like foragers, are somewhat limited in their possessions, for they too are nomadic. But pastoralists can use their animals to carry some possessions. Each family owns its own tools, clothes, and perhaps a tent, as well as its own livestock. The livestock are the sources of other needed articles, for the pastoralists often trade their herd products for the products of the townspeople. Horticulturalists, on the other hand, are more selfsufficient than pastoralists. Their principal farming tools are the knife for slashing and the hoe or stick for digging. What a person makes is considered his or her own, yet everyone is often obligated to lend tools to others. In Chuuk society, the owner of a canoe has first use of it; the same is true for farming implements. Yet if a close relative needs the canoe and finds it unused, the canoe may be taken without permission. A distant relative or neighbor must ask permission to borrow any tools, but the owner may not refuse. If owners were to refuse, they would risk being scorned and refused if they were to need tools later.

Societies with intensive agriculture and industrialized societies are likely to have tools that are made by specialists and that must, therefore, be acquired by trade or purchase. Probably because complex tools cost a considerable amount of money, they are less likely than simple tools to be shared, except by those who contributed to the purchase price. A diesel-powered combine, for example, requires a large amount of capital for its purchase and upkeep. The person who has supplied the capital is likely to regard the machine as individual private property and to regulate its use and disposal. The owner must then use the machine to produce enough surplus to pay for its cost and upkeep, as well as for its replacement. The owner may rent the machine to neighboring farmers during slack periods to obtain a maximum return on the investment.

Expensive equipment, however, is not always individually owned in societies with intensive agriculture or industrialized economies. Even in capitalist countries, there may be collective ownership of machines by cooperatives or co-ownership with neighbors.23 Governments often own very expensive equipment or facilities, such as airports, highways, and dams, on behalf of the entire society. Rights of use depend on the facility. Anyone can use a highway, but only contributing municipalities can draw upon the water in a dam. Other productive resources in industrial societies, such as factories or service companies, may be owned jointly by shareholders, who purchase a portion of a corporation's assets in return for a proportionate share of its earnings. The proportion of technology and facilities owned by various levels of government also reflects the type of political-economic system—socialist and communist countries have more public ownership than do capitalist countries.

16.2 Explain the different types of economic production and economic exchange and their effect on labor.

## The Conversion of Resources

All societies transform or convert resources through labor into food, tools, and other goods. This conversion of resources constitutes what economists call *production.* In this section, after briefly reviewing different types of production, we examine what motivates people to work, how societies divide up the work to be done, and how they organize work. Some aspects of the conversion of natural resources are culturally universal, but there is also an enormous amount of cultural variation.

#### Types of Economic Production

Domestic When they were first described, most of the societies known to anthropology had a *domestic*—family or kinship—mode of production. Labor consisted of people getting food and producing shelter and implements for themselves and their kin. Families usually had the right to exploit productive resources and control the products of their labor. Even part-time specialists, such as potters, could support themselves without their craftwork if they needed to.

Industrial At the other extreme, *industrial* societies rely largely on mechanized production, in agriculture as well as in factories. Because machines and materials are costly, only some individuals (capitalists), corporations, or governments can afford the expenses of production. Therefore, most people in industrial societies labor for others as wage earners. Although wages can buy food, people out of work lose their ability to support themselves unless they are protected by welfare payments or unemployment insurance.

Tributary Found in nonindustrial societies, a third system is the *tributary* type of production, wherein most people still produce their own food but an elite or aristocracy controls a portion of production, including the products of specialized crafts. As the name implies, people pay a tribute of labor or produce to the elite landowner or ruler

who grants them access to land. The feudal societies of medieval Western Europe were examples of tributary production, as was czarist Russia when it practiced serfdom.24

Post-industrial It is often suggested that the U.S. economy and other developed economies are now moving from *industrialism* to *post-industrialism*. In many areas of commerce, computers have radically transformed the workplace. Because computers can "drive" machines and robots, much of the manual work required in industry is disappearing. Businesses are now more knowledge and service oriented. Information has become so easily accessible through telecommunication that *telecommuting* has entered the English vocabulary to describe how people can now work for wages at home. This economic transformation has important implications for both home life and the workplace. With inexpensive home computers and speedy data transmission by telephone and other means, more people are able to work at home. In addition, when information and knowledge become more important than capital equipment, more people can own and have access to the productive resources of society.25 If "who owns what" partly determines who has political and other influence, the wider ownership of resources that is possible in postindustrial society may eventually translate into new, more democratic political forms and processes.

#### Incentives for Labor

Why do people work? Probably all of us have asked ourselves this question. Our concern may not be why other people are working, but why we have to work. Clearly, part of the answer is that work is necessary for survival. Although there are always some able-bodied adults who do not work as much as they should and rely on the labor of others, no society would survive if most able-bodied adults were idle. In fact, most societies probably succeed in motivating most people to want to do (and even enjoy) what they have to do. But are the incentives for labor the same in all societies? Anthropologists believe the answer is both yes and no. One reason people work is because they must. But why do people in some societies apparently work *more* than they must?

The Profit Motive? We can be fairly certain that a particular and often-cited motive—the profit motive, or the desire to exchange something for more than it costs—is not universal or always the dominant motive. There can be no profit motive among people who produce food and other goods primarily for their own consumption, as do most foragers, most horticulturalists, and even some intensive agriculturalists. Such societies have what we call a *subsistence economy*, not a money or commercial economy. Anthropologists have noticed that people in subsistence economies (with a domestic mode of production) often work less than people in commercial economies (with tributary or industrial modes of production). Indeed, foragers appear to have a considerable amount of leisure time, as do many horticulturalists. It has been estimated, for example, that the men of the horticultural Kuikuru tribe in central Brazil spent about three and a half hours a day on subsistence. It appears that the Kuikuru could have produced a substantial surplus of manioc, their staple food, by working 30 minutes more a day.26 Yet they and many other peoples do not produce more than they need. Why should they? They cannot store a surplus for long because it would rot; they cannot sell it because there is no market nearby; and they do not have a political authority that might collect it for some purpose. Although we often think "more is better," a foodgetting strategy with such a goal might even be disastrous, especially for foragers. The killing of more animals than a group could eat might seriously jeopardize the food supply in the future, because overhunting could reduce reproduction among the hunted animals.27 Horticulturalists might do well to plant a little extra, just in case part of the crop failed, but a great deal extra would be a tremendous waste of time and effort.

Chayanov's Rule It has been suggested that, when resources are converted primarily for household consumption, people will work harder if they have more consumers in the household. That is, when there are few able-bodied workers and a proportionately large number of consumers (perhaps because there are many young children and elderly people), the workers have to work harder. But when there are proportionately more workers, they can work less. This idea is called *Chayanov's rule*. 28 Alexander Chayanov found this relationship in data on rural Russians before the Russian Revolution.29 But it appears to work in other places, too. Paul Durrenberger and Nicola Tannenbaum collected data in several villages in Thailand and found general support for Chayanov's rule,30 and Michael Chibnik found support for Chayanov's rule when he compared data from 12 communities in five areas of the world. The communities ranged in complexity from New Guinea horticulturalists to Swiss commercial farmers. Although Chayanov restricted his theory to farmers who produced food mostly for their own consumption and did not hire labor, Chibnik's analysis suggests that Chayanov's rule applies even to hired labor.31 On the other hand, Durrenberger and Tannenbaum found that political and social factors explained some of the variability in household production. In villages that lacked social classes, for example, families with a high ratio of workers to consumers produced less, apparently to avoid doing much better than other families. In contrast, in the villages that had social classes, households with a high ratio of workers to consumers produced more and gained prestige from their efforts.32

Social Rewards of Sharing There appear to be many societies in which some people work harder than they would need to in order to support their own families. What motivates them to work harder? They often share and transfer food and goods well beyond their own households, at times extending their reach to the whole community or even groups of communities. In such societies, social rewards come to those who are generous, who give things away. Thus, people who work harder than they have to for subsistence may be motivated to do so in order to gain respect or esteem.33 Also, in many societies extra food and goods may be needed at times for special purposes and occasions; goods and services may be needed to arrange and celebrate marriages, to form alliances, and to perform rituals and ceremonies (including what we would call sporting events). Thus, how the culture defines what one works for and what is required may go beyond what is necessary.

Achievement In commercial economies such as the United States—where food, other goods, and services are sold and bought—people seem to be motivated to keep any extra income for themselves and their families. Extra income is converted into bigger dwellings, more expensive furnishings and food, and other elements of a "higher" standard of living. But the desire to improve one's standard of living is probably not their only motive. Some people may work partly to satisfy a need for achievement34 or because they find their work enjoyable. In addition, just as in precommercial societies, some people may work partly to gain respect or influence by giving some of their income away. Not only are philanthropists and movie stars respected for giving to charities, but society encourages such giving by making it an allowable tax deduction. Still, commercial societies emphasize giving less than subsistence economies. People consider charity by the religious or rich appropriate and even admirable but would find giving away so much as to become poverty-stricken foolish.

#### Forced and Required Labor

Thus far, we have mostly discussed *voluntary labor*—voluntary in the sense that no formal organization within the society compels people to work and punishes them for not working. Social training and social pressure are powerful enough to persuade an individual to perform some useful task. In both food-collecting and horticultural societies, individuals who can stand being the butt of jokes about laziness will still be fed. At most, the other members of the group will ignore them. There is no reason to punish them and no way to coerce them to do the work expected of them.

Taxation More complex societies have ways of forcing people to work for the authorities, whether those authorities are kings or presidents. An indirect form of forced labor is taxation. The average tax in the United States (local, state, and federal) is about 33 percent of income, which means that the average person works four months out of the year for the various levels of government. If a person decides not to pay the tax, the money will be taken forcibly, or the person may be put in prison.

Corvée Money is the customary form of tax payment in a commercial society. In a politically complex but nonmonetary society, people may pay their taxes in other ways—by performing a certain number of hours of labor or by giving up a certain percentage of what they produce. The **corvée**, a system of required labor, existed in the Inca Empire in the central Andes before the Spanish conquest. Each male commoner was assigned three plots of land to work: a temple plot, a state plot, and his own plot. The enormous stores of food that went into state warehouses were used to supply the nobles, the army, the artisans, and all other state employees. If labor became overabundant, the people were still kept occupied; it is said that one ruler had a hill moved to keep some laborers busy. In addition to subsistence work for the state, Inca commoners were subject to military service, to duty as personal servants for the nobility, and to other "public" service.35 Elderly villagers in the Chiang Mai area of Thailand describe corvée this way: "Villagers had to work one *rai* [*rai myong* or 0.1 acre] per person for them [the rulers] for nothing. *And* one had to do it properly. The lord's underlings would take a banana tree trunk and stick it upright in the field after it was plowed. If it fell over, that meant it was well plowed. Otherwise, one would have to keep on plowing until the ground was soft."<sup>36</sup> a little salary.

Conscription or the draft, or compulsory military service, is also a form of corvée, in that a certain period of service is required, and failure to serve can be punished by a prison term or involuntary exile. Emperors of China had soldiers drafted to defend their territory and to build the Great Wall along the northern borders of the empire. The wall extends over 1,500 miles, and thousands were drafted to work on it.

**Slavery** is the most extreme form of forced work, in that slaves have little control over their labor. The practice of enslaving people has existed in almost every part of the world at one time or another, in simpler as well as in more complex societies. Slaves are often obtained from other cultures directly; they are kidnapped, captured in war, or given as tribute. Or they may be obtained indirectly through barter or trade. Slaves have sometimes come from the same culture; people have become slaves to repay a debt, as punishment for a crime, or even because it was an alternative to poverty. The degree to which slaves can gain their freedom varies among slave societies.

#### Division of Labor

All societies have some division of labor, some customary assignment of different kinds of work to different kinds of people. Universally, males and females, and adults and children, do not do the same kinds of work. In a sense, then, division of labor by gender and age is a kind of universal specialization of labor. Many societies known to anthropology divide labor only by gender and age; other societies have more complex specialization.

By Gender and Age All societies make use of gender differences to some extent in their customary assignment of labor. In the chapter on sex and gender, we discuss the division of labor by gender in detail.

Age is also a universal basis for division of labor. Clearly, children cannot do work that requires a great deal of strength. But, in many societies, girls and boys contribute much more in labor than do children in our own society. For example, they help in animal tending, weeding, and harvesting and do a variety of domestic chores such as child care, fetching water and firewood, and cooking and cleaning. In agricultural communities in the Ivory Coast, children's tasks mirror the tasks of same-sex adults (see Figure 16.1). In some societies, a child who is 6 years old is considered old enough to be responsible for a younger sibling for a good part of the day.<sup>37</sup> Animal tending is often important work for children. Children in some societies spend more time at this task than adults.<sup>38</sup>

Why do children do so much work in some societies? If adults, particularly mothers, have heavy

workloads, and children are physically and mentally able to do the work, a good part of the work is likely to be assigned to children.39 As we have seen, food producers probably have more work than foragers, so we would expect that children would be likely to work more where there is herding and farming. Consistent with this expectation, Patricia Draper and Elizabeth Cashdan found differences in children's work between nomadic and settled !Kung. Even though recently settled !Kung have not switched completely from foraging to food production, children's as well as adults' activities have changed considerably. The children living in nomadic camps had virtually no work at all; adults did all the gathering and hunting. But the settled children were given lots of chores, ranging from helping with animals to helping with the harvest and food processing.<sup>40</sup>

What we have said about the !Kung should not imply that children in foraging societies always do little work. For example, among the Hadza of Tanzania, children between the ages of 5 and 10 are able to get one-third to one-half of their calories as they forage with their mothers. The Hadza also have more children than the !Kung.<sup>41</sup> Is there a relationship between children's work and fertility? When children in a society do a great deal of work, parents may value them more and may consciously want to have more children.42 This may be one of the reasons why birth rates are especially high in intensive agricultural societies where workloads are very high.<sup>43</sup>

Beyond Gender and Age In societies with relatively simple technologies, there is little specialization of labor beyond that of gender and age. But as a society's technology becomes more complex and it is able to produce large quantities of food, more of its people are freed from subsistence work to become specialists in some other tasks.

In contrast with foragers, horticultural societies may have some part-time specialists. Some people may devote special effort to perfecting a particular skill or craft—pottery making, weaving, house building, doctoring—and in return for their products or services be given food or other gifts. Among some horticultural groups, the entire village may specialize part-time in making a particular product, which can then be traded to neighboring people.

With the development of intensive agriculture, full-time specialists—potters, weavers, blacksmiths—begin to appear. The trend toward greater specialization reaches its peak in industrialized societies, where workers develop skills in one small area of the economic system. Full-time specialization makes people dependent on the necessity to sell their labor or products to make a living. In societies with full-time occupational specialization, different jobs are usually associated with differences in prestige, wealth, and power, as we shall see in the chapter on social stratification.

#### The Organization of Labor

The degree to which labor has to be organized reaches its peak in industrial societies, which have great occupational specialization and complex political organization. The coordination required to produce an automobile on an assembly line is obvious; so is the coordination required to collect taxes from every wage earner.

In many food-collecting and horticultural societies, there is little formal organization of work. Work groups tend to be organized only when productive work requires it and to dissolve when they are no longer needed. Furthermore, the groups so organized often have changing composition and leadership; participation tends to be individualistic and voluntary.44 Perhaps this flexibility is possible because, when virtually everyone has the same work to do, little instruction is needed, and almost anyone can assume leadership. Still, some types of work require more organization than others. Hunting big game usually requires coordinated efforts by a large number of hunters; so might catching fish in large nets. For example, on Moala, a Fijian island in the Pacific, net fishing is a group affair. A party of 20 to 30 women wades out on the reef and makes a semicircle of nets. At a signal from an experienced woman, usually the chief's wife, the women move together at the ends, forming a circle. After the fish are caught in the nets, the women bite them on the backs of their heads to kill them and put them in baskets that they carry ashore. Around Christmas, the village, or several villages, undertakes a larger fish drive. The day before, more than 100 people make a "sweep," some 1,600 yards long, from coconut fronds. The next day, the men, women, and children all participate in the surround, catching thousands of fish.<sup>45</sup>

Kinship ties are an important basis for work organization, particularly in nonindustrial societies. For example, among the horticultural Kapauku of western New Guinea, the male members of a village are a kin group, and all work together to build drainage ditches, large fences, and bridges.46 With increasing technological complexity, the basis of work organization begins to shift to more formally organized groups.47 In modern industrial societies, the predominant basis of organization is the *contract*—the agreement between employers and employees whereby the latter perform a specified amount of work for a specified amount of wages. Although the arrangement may be entered into voluntarily, laws and the power of the state enforce the obligation of the parties to abide by the contract.

#### Making Decisions About Work

Foragers ignore many of the plant and animal species in their environment, choosing to go after only some. Why? The people may say that some animals are taboo whereas others are delicious. But where do such customary beliefs come from? Are they adaptive? And if there are no customary preferences for certain plants and animals, how can we explain why a food collector will go after certain foods and ignore others on a particular day? Food producers also make choices constantly. For example, a farmer has to decide when to plant, what to plant, how much to plant, when to harvest, how much to store, and how much to give away or sell. Researchers have tried to explain why certain economic decisions become customary and why individuals make certain economic choices in their everyday lives.

#### **Optimal foraging**

**theory** The theory that individuals seek to maximize the returns (in calories and nutrients) on their labor in deciding which animals and plants they will go after.

16.3 Explain the three general types of systems for distributing goods and services (reciprocity, redistribution, and market or commercial exchange).

**Reciprocity** Giving and taking (not politically arranged) without the use of money.

A frequent source of ideas about choices is **optimal foraging theory**, which was developed originally by students of animal behavior and which has been applied to decision making by foragers. Optimal foraging theory assumes that individuals seek to maximize the returns, in calories and nutrients, on their labor in deciding which animals and plants to hunt or collect. Natural selection should favor optimal foraging because "good" decisions would increase the chances of survival and reproduction. Research in different food-collecting societies supports the optimal foraging model.48 For example, the Aché of eastern Paraguay consistently prefer to hunt peccaries (wild piglike mammals) rather than armadillos. Although peccaries take much longer to find and are harder to kill than armadillos, a day spent hunting peccaries yields more than 4,600 calories per hour of work, whereas hunting armadillos yields only about 1,800 calories an hour.49 Other factors in addition to calorie yield, such as predictability of resources, may also influence which foods are collected. For example, the !Kung of the Kalahari Desert depend largely on mongongo nuts, even though these nuts yield fewer calories per hour of work than does meat. But mongongo nuts in season are more dependable than game is. Once a group of !Kung hikes to a grove of ripe mongongo nuts, they know they can obtain food there until the supply is exhausted; they are not as certain of getting game when they seek it.50 Similarly on Ifaluk, an atoll in the Federated States of Micronesia, where fishing is the main source of animal protein, men most often choose to fish in the place where there is the highest return on average. But they do not always fish there; if the return on a previous day was lower than average, they tend to choose other spots.51

How does a farmer decide whether to plant a particular crop and how much land and labor to devote to it? Christina Gladwin and others suggested that farmers make decisions in steps, with each choice point involving a yes or no answer. For example, in the high-altitude region of Guatemala, farmers could choose to plant about eight crops, or combinations of them, such as corn and beans, which grow together well. A farmer will quickly exclude some choices because of the answers to certain questions: Can I afford the seed and fertilizer? Can this crop be watered

adequately? Is the altitude appropriate? And so on. If any of the answers is no, the crop is not planted. By a further series of yes-or-no decisions, farmers presumably decide which of the remaining possibilities will be planted.52

Individuals may not always be able to state clearly their rules for making decisions, nor do they always have complete knowledge about the various possibilities, particularly when some of the possibilities are new. That does not mean, however, that researchers cannot predict or explain economic choices. For example, Michael Chibnik found that men in two villages in Belize and in Central America were not able to say why they devoted more or less time to working for wages versus growing crops. But their behavior was still predictable. Older men grew crops because wage labor was more physically demanding; and in the village with a higher cost of living, men were more likely to work for wages.53

## The Distribution of Goods and Services

Goods and services are distributed in all societies by systems that, however varied, can be classified under three general types: reciprocity, redistribution, and market or commercial exchange.54 The three systems often coexist in a society, but one system usually predominates. The predominant system seems to be associated with the society's food-getting technology and, more specifically, its level of economic development.

#### Reciprocity

**Reciprocity** consists of giving and taking without the use of money; it mainly takes the form of gift giving or generalized reciprocity. There may also be exchanges of equal value (barter or nonmonetary trade) or balanced reciprocity without the use of money.55

Generalized Reciprocity When goods or services are given to another, without any apparent expectation of a return gift, we call it **generalized reciprocity**. Generalized reciprocity sustains the family in all societies. Parents give food, clothing, and labor to children because they want to or perhaps feel obliged to, but they do not usually calculate exactly how their children will reciprocate years later. These gifts are one-way transfers. In this sense, all societies have some kind of generalized reciprocity. But some societies depend on it almost entirely to distribute goods and services.

Lorna Marshall recounted how the !Kung divided an eland brought to a site where five bands and several visitors were camping—more than 100 people in all. The owner of the arrow that had first penetrated the eland was, by custom, the owner of the meat. He first distributed the forequarters to the two hunters who had aided him in the kill. After that, the distribution depended on kinship: Each hunter shared with his wives' parents, wives, children, parents, and siblings, and they in turn shared with their kin. Sixty-three gifts of raw meat were recorded, after which further sharing of raw and cooked meat was begun. The !Kung distribution of large game—clearly, generalized reciprocity—is common among foragers. But giving away is not limited to game. For example, when Marshall left the band that had sponsored her in 1951, she gave each woman in the band a present of enough cowrie shells to make a necklace—one large shell and 20 small ones. When she returned in 1952, she found no cowrie shell necklaces and hardly a single shell among the people in the band. Instead, the shells appeared by ones and twos in the ornaments of the people of neighboring bands.56

Although generalized reciprocity may seem altruistic or unselfish, researchers have suggested that giving may in fact benefit the givers in various ways. For example, parents who help their children may not only perpetuate their genes (the ultimate biological benefit) but may also be likely to receive care and affection from their grown-up children when the parents are old. And giving parents may be happier and enjoy life more than nongiving parents. So, in the shorter as well as the longer run, givers may derive economic and psychological benefits, in addition to reproductive benefits.

Parent-child giving may seem easy to understand, but why do some societies rely more on generalized reciprocity than others, particularly beyond the family? Sharing may be most likely when resources are unpredictable. A !Kung band may share its water with other bands because they may have water now but not in the future. A related group in the Kalahari, the G//ana,57 has been observed to share less than other groups. It turns out that the resources available to the G//ana are more predictable because the G//ana supplement their hunting and gathering with plant cultivation and goat herding. Cultivated melons (which store water) appear to buffer the G//ana against water shortages, and goats buffer them against shortages of game. Thus, whereas the !Kung distribute the meat right after a kill, the G//ana dry it and then store it in their houses.58

The idea that unpredictability favors sharing may also explain why some foods are more often shared than others. Wild game, for example, is usually unpredictable; when hunters go out to hunt, they cannot be sure that they will come back with meat. Wild plants, on the other hand, are more predictable; gatherers can be sure when they go out that they will come back with at least some plant foods. In any case, it does appear that foragers tend to share game much more than wild plant foods.59 Even among people who depend largely on horticulture, such as the Yanomamö of Venezuela and Brazil, food items that are less predictably obtained (hunted game and fish) are shared more often than the more predictably obtained garden produce.60 But although meat is shared more than plant

**Generalized reciprocity** Gift giving without any immediate or planned return.

food, horticulturalists often share foraged or cultivated plants. Why? Sharing plant food may be advantageous to horticulturalists who are some distance from their gardens because they may not have to go as often. And sharing may solidify a social relationship so that other families will help in times of need, such as sickness or accident, when it may be hard to work.61 Does food sharing increase the food supply for an individual? Calculations for the Aché of eastern Paraguay, who get most of their food from hunting when they go on food-collecting trips, suggest that the average individual gets more food when food is shared. Even the males who actually do the hunting get more, although the benefits are greater for the females and children on the trip.62 Mathematically, the risk that an individual food collector will not find enough food on a particular day will be appreciably reduced if at least six to eight adult collectors share the food they collect. Food-collecting bands may often contain only 25 to 30 people, which is about the size that is needed to ensure that there are six to eight adult collectors.<sup>63</sup>

Although giving things to others may be expected in some societies, this does not necessarily mean that everyone does so willingly or without some social pressure. For example, the !Kung call "far-hearted" anyone who does not give gifts, and they express their disapproval openly.

Day-to-day unpredictability is one thing; more prolonged scarcity is another. What happens to a system of generalized reciprocity when resources are scarce because of a drought or other disaster? Does the ethic of giving break down? Evidence from a few societies suggests that the degree of sharing may actually *increase* during the period of food shortage.64 For example, in describing the Netsilik Inuit, Asen Balikci said, "Whenever game was abundant, sharing among non-relatives was avoided, since every family was supposedly capable of obtaining the necessary catch. In situations of scarcity, however, caribou meat was more evenly distributed throughout camp."65 Sharing may increase during mild scarcity because people can minimize their deprivation, but generalized reciprocity may be strained by extreme scarcity such as famine.66

Researchers generally find it difficult to explain the concept of sharing because they assume that, other things being equal, individuals will tend to be selfish. Most theories about sharing point out that sharing gives individuals advantages in certain circumstances. And it is in those circumstances that societies have found ways to make sharing a moral issue or to otherwise make non-sharers extremely uncomfortable. But increasingly a variety of evidence—experimental and observational—suggests that altruism, or selfless behavior, may be more common than we think. Even some nonhuman primates, such as chimpanzees, share with another chimp when they are given an experimental choice to do so.67 Experimental evidence suggests that sharing in humans is likely even among people who do not know each other or who have no expectation of any return in the future from that person. Experimenters set up "games" in which they can control for or eliminate certain responses. For example, in one two-person game a player receives an amount of money and must decide what share of it to offer to the second player. The second player can accept or reject the offer; but, if he or she rejects the offered amount, neither player gets any money. If the second player accepts the offered amount, both players receive the proposed division. If selfishness were normal, one would expect that the proposer of the division would try to give away as little as possible and the second player should always accept whatever is offered because otherwise nothing is gained. Surprisingly, equal divisions are commonly proposed and low offers are commonly rejected because they are viewed as unfair. If a person views the offer as unfair and forfeits any money, he or she seems willing to "punish" the greedy individual. While such experiments were mostly done at first in Western societies, we now have results from over 15 other societies that largely confirm the earlier results.68 And there is now evidence suggesting that cooperation may even evoke pleasure. Researchers studying brain activity in women, who are playing a game allowing either cooperative or greedy strategies, found to their surprise that cooperation made certain areas of the brain light up. These areas are normally associated with pleasure, such as when eating desserts. And friends spontaneously smile more when they share.69 So cooperation may be more "natural" than some people think.70

But what does "more natural" mean? Do humans have a genetic propensity to share? And if they do, altruism presents a genetic puzzle, because there are costs to altruistic actions such as helping a person in danger or giving away some of your food or money. And these costs should lead to a genetic disadvantage. To try to address the paradox, evolutionary anthropologists postulate that if altruism were mostly kin-based, and kin share many of your genes, then helping your relatives could increase altruism. Or, if you reciprocate with a partner (they help you and you help them), both individuals may do better. The problem for these theories is that in many societies, particularly foraging societies, sharing has been shown to be widespread, particularly when it involves large game. Neither kin-selection altruism or reciprocal altruism seem to explain such sharing. As we discussed earlier, a group of male hunters and their families may do better if they share large game. The ethic of cooperation and generosity is widespread among foragers, so perhaps altruists benefitted in another way. Suppose early human societies unconsciously rewarded people who were generous and punished people who were not. These cultural behaviors and values could, over the long stretch of time that humans were foragers, have favored some altruistic propensities if benefits, such as prestige and getting better mates, outweighed the costs.71 If this scenario were correct, we would have an interaction between cultural and genetic evolution that promoted altruism. Some researchers believe that altruism is at least partly genetic, since even 14- to 18-month-old children will offer help when they perceive that is needed; confronted with someone who has dropped an object and not picked it up, they will pick it up.72 But regardless of whether humans have some biological propensity to altruism, some cultures value altruism more than others. It is that variation that we need to explain.

Balanced Reciprocity **Balanced reciprocity** is explicit and short term in its expectations of return. In contrast to generalized reciprocity or a one-way transfer, which has no expectation of a return, balanced reciprocity involves either an immediate exchange of goods or services or an agreed-upon exchange over a limited period of time. *Barter* is the term used most often for this type of nonmonetary exchange of goods and services. The !Kung, for instance, trade with the Tswana Bantu: a gemsbok hide for a pile of tobacco, five strings of beads made from ostrich eggshells for a spear, or three small skins for a good-sized knife.73 In the 1600s, the Iroquois of the North American Northeast traded deerskin to Europeans for brass kettles, iron hinges, steel axes, woven textiles, and guns.74 The !Kung and Iroquois acquired trade goods by balanced reciprocity, but such exchanges were not crucial to their economies.

In contrast, some societies depend much more heavily on balanced reciprocity. For example, the Efe, who hunt and gather in the Ituri forest of central Africa, get most of their calories from manioc, peanuts, rice, and plaintains grown by another group—the agricultural Lese. Efe men and women provide labor to the Lese and in exchange receive a portion of the harvest as well as goods such as metal pots and spears.75 Pastoralists, too, are rarely self-sufficient, as we mentioned in the preceding chapter. They have to trade their pastoral products to agriculturalists to get the grain and other things they need.

Balanced reciprocity may mostly involve labor. Cooperative work parties usually exchange or balance gifts of labor. A cooperative work party, or *kuu,* among the Kpelle of Liberia may number from 6 to 40 people, all of whom are generally relatives or friends. In addition to promising return work on a particular date, each farmer rewards the work party's hard day's labor by providing a feast and sometimes rhythmic music to work by.76 When we say that an exchange is balanced, we do not mean to imply that the things exchanged are exactly equivalent in value or that the exchange is purely economic. In the absence of a money economy, where there is no explicit standard by which value can be judged, there is no way to assess value objectively. The point is that the parties in balanced reciprocity are freely giving each other the respective goods and services they each want; they are not coerced into doing so, so presumably they are not conceiving of the exchange as unbalanced.77 And when something is valued, it may be valued for other than economic reasons. The exchange itself may also be fun, adventuresome, or aesthetically pleasing, or it may enhance social relationships.

Because exchanges can have different motivations, they can have different meanings. Consequently, some economic anthropologists now want to distinguish between gift and commodity exchanges. *Gift exchanges* are personal and involve the creation or perpetuation of some kind of enduring relationship between people and groups. In our society, the exchange of dinner invitations or Christmas gifts is motivated by social considerations; **Balanced reciprocity** Giving with the expectation of a straightforward immediate or limited-time trade.

we are not interested only in the actual food or objects received. In contrast, *commodity exchanges,* which can occur even in the absence of money, focus on the objects or services received—the transaction itself is the motive. When the transaction is completed, the relationship between the parties involved usually ends.78

The *Kula* Ring The horticultural Trobriand Islanders, who live off the eastern coast of New Guinea, worked out an elaborate scheme for trading ornaments, food, and other necessities with the people of neighboring islands. The exchange of goods between farflung islands is essential, for some of the islands are small and rocky and cannot produce enough food to sustain their inhabitants, who specialize instead in canoe building, pottery making, and other crafts. Other islanders produce far more yams, taro, and pigs than they need. However, the practical side of the trade is hidden beneath a complex ceremonial exchange, called the *kula* **ring**, an exchange of valued shell ornaments across a set of farflung islands.<sup>79</sup>

Two kinds of ornaments are involved in the ceremonial exchanges—white shell armbands (*mwali*), which are given only in a counterclockwise direction, and red shell necklaces (*soulava*), which are given only in a clockwise direction. The possession of one or more of these ornaments allows a man to organize an expedition to the home of one of his trading partners on another island. The high point of an expedition is the ceremonial giving of the valued *kula* ornaments. During the two- to three-day visit, the trading of necessities goes on. Some of the exchange takes the form of gift giving between trading partners. By the time the visitors leave, they have accomplished a year's trading without seeming to do so.

But the practical advantages of the *kula* ring are not the only gains. There may be purely social ones, for goods are traded with ease and enjoyment. A trading expedition takes on the flavor of adventure rather than of business. Many of the traditions of the islands are kept alive: Myth, romance, ritual, and history are linked to the circulating ornaments, especially the larger, finer pieces, which are well known and recognized as heirlooms. A man is able to possess many valued things within his lifetime, each for a year or so. Each object, when it is received, arouses enthusiasm in a way that one lifelong possession could not.80 The *kula* ring continued to be an important institution after Papua New Guinea became an independent country. For example, active participation in the *kula* ring helped candidates in the 1960s and the 1970s to be elected to the national parliament.81

The *kula* is not the only form of exchange in Trobriand life. For example, on the two days following a burial, the kin of the deceased give yams, taro, and valuables to those who helped care for the deceased before death, to those who participated in the burial ceremonies, and to those who came to mourn the deceased. After these initial exchanges, the hamlet settles into mourning. Women from other hamlets bring food to the people in mourning, and the mourning women prepare bundles of banana leaves and weave skirts of banana fiber for later distribution. Husbands help their wives accumulate valuables to "buy" extra bundles of banana leaves. Then the women's mortuary ceremony is held. It is very competitive—each of the mourning women tries to distribute the most bundles and skirts. As many as 5,000 bundles and 30 skirts might be distributed by one mourning woman in a single day. Each of these giveaways completes a balanced reciprocity: The giver is reciprocating for gifts of goods and services received in the past. A woman's brothers gave her yams and taro during the year. She gives her brothers' wives bundles or skirts, which are also given to those who helped make the special mourning skirts and to those who brought or cooked food during the mourning period.82

Sometimes the line between generalized and balanced reciprocity is not so clear. Consider our gift giving at Christmas. Although such gift giving may appear to be generalized reciprocity, and it often is in the case of gift giving from parents to children, there may be strong expectations of balance. Two friends or relatives may try to exchange presents of fairly equal value, based on calculations of what last year's gift cost. If a person receives a \$5 present when he or she gave a \$25 present, that person may be hurt and perhaps angry. On the other hand, a person who receives a \$500 present when he or she gave a \$25 present may well also be dismayed. But Christmas giving, like the Trobriand *kula* ring, also illustrates that exchanges are not simply economic but serve many other purposes, including fun.

Kinship Distance and Type of Reciprocity Most food-collecting and horticultural societies depend on some form of reciprocity for the distribution of goods and labor. Marshall Sahlins suggested that the form of the reciprocity depends largely on the kinship distance between people. Generalized reciprocity may be the rule for family members and close kinsmen. Balanced reciprocity may be practiced among equals who are not closely related. People who would consider it inappropriate to trade with their own families will trade with neighboring groups.83 In general, the importance of reciprocity declines with economic development.84 In societies with intensive agriculture, and even more so in industrialized societies, reciprocity distributes only a small proportion of goods and services.

Reciprocity as a Leveling Device Reciprocal gift giving may do more than equalize the distribution of goods within a community, as in the sharing that takes place among the !Kung. It may also tend to equalize the distribution of goods between communities.

Many Melanesian societies in and near New Guinea have the custom of holding pig feasts in which 50, 100, or even 2,000 pigs are slaughtered. Andrew Vayda, Anthony Leeds, and David Smith have suggested that these enormous feasts, though apparently wasteful, are just one of the outcomes of a complex of cultural practices that are highly advantageous to a community. The people of these societies cannot accurately predict how much food they will produce during the year. Some years they will have bumper crops and other years very poor crops because of fluctuations in the weather. Overplanting can be a hedge against such fluctuations, but it can also result in overproduction when the weather supports an average or exceptionally good yield. What can a community do with this extra food? Because root plants such as yams and taro, which are the main crops cultivated by Melanesian societies, do not keep well over long periods, the surplus is fed to pigs. In effect, pigs serve as food repositories and food processors, since the same plump, yam-fed pigs become a food source during lean times. However, if there are several years of crop surplus, the resulting increase in pigs can become too much of a good thing. Pigs wanting food can destroy yam and taro patches. What does a village do when the pig population grows to a menacing proportion? It invites other villages to a gigantic pig roast. Over the years, the pig feasts serve to equalize the food consumption, and especially the protein consumption, of all the villages that participate in the feasts.85 Thus, the custom of pig feasts may be a way for villages to "bank" surplus food by storing up "social credit" with other villages, which will return that credit in subsequent feasts.

**Potlatch** A feast among Pacific Northwest Native Americans at which great quantities of food and goods are given to the guests in order to gain prestige for the host(s).

#### **Redistribution** The accumulation of goods (or labor) by a particular person or in a particular place and their subsequent distribution.

In some Melanesian societies, the pig feasts foster an element of competition among the men who give them. "Big men" may try to bolster their status and prestige by the size of their feasts. A reputation is enhanced not by keeping wealth but by giving it away. A similar situation existed among many Native American groups of the Pacific Northwest, where a chief might attempt to enhance his status by holding a **potlatch**. At a potlatch, a chief and his group would give away blankets, pieces of copper, canoes, large quantities of food, and other items to their guests. The host chief and his group would later be invited to other potlatches.

The competitive element in the potlatch appears to have intensified after contact with Europeans. Because of the fur trade, the number of trade goods increased, and so more items could be given away. Possibly more important was the population decline among the Indians, caused by diseases such as smallpox that European traders introduced. Distant relatives of chiefs who had no direct heirs might compete for the right to the title, each attempting to give away more than the others.86 Chiefs may also have attempted to attract men to their half-empty villages by spectacular giveaways.87 Decimated groups might have coalesced to maintain the potlatching. For example, when the Tlingit population declined to a low in the 1910s, kin groups coalesced to assemble enough resources for a potlatch.88 Although the potlatch system seems wasteful in that goods were often destroyed in the competition, the system probably also served to equalize the distribution of goods among competing groups.

On one level of analysis, the Melanesian pig feasts and the Pacific Northwest potlatches were all reciprocal exchanges between communities or villages. But these exchanges were not just intercommunity versions of reciprocal gift giving between individuals. Because these feasts were organized by people who collected goods, they also involved another mode of distribution, which anthropologists call *redistribution.*

#### Redistribution

**Redistribution** is the accumulation of goods or labor by a particular person or agency, or in a particular place, for the purpose of subsequent distribution. Although redistribution is found in all societies, it becomes an important mechanism only in societies that have political hierarchies—that is, chiefs or other specialized officials and agencies. In all societies, there is some redistribution, at least within the family. Members of the family pool their labor, products, or income for the common good. But in many societies, there is little or no redistribution beyond the family. It seems that redistribution on a territorial basis emerges when there is a political apparatus to coordinate centralized collection and distribution of goods or to mobilize labor for some public purpose.

In the African state of Bunyoro, in western Uganda, for example, the king (called the *mukama*) retained much of the wealth for himself and his close kin. The *mukama* had the authority to grant the use of land and all other natural resources to his subordinate chiefs, and they in turn granted it to the common people. In return, everyone was required to give the *mukama* large quantities of food, crafts, and even labor services. The *mukama* then redistributed these goods and services, in theory at least, to all the people. The *mukama* was praised with names that emphasized his generosity: *Agutamba* ("he who relieves distress") and *Mwebingwa* ("he to whom the people run for help"). But it is clear that much of what the king redistributed did not find its way back to the common people, who produced the bulk of the goods. Instead, the wealth was distributed largely according to rank within the state.89

Other redistribution systems are more equal. For example, among the Buin of Melanesia, "the chief is housed, dressed, and fed exactly like his bondsman."90 Even though the chief owns most of the pigs, everyone shares equally in the consumption of the wealth. In general, however, where redistribution is important, as in societies with higher levels of productivity, the wealthy are more likely than the poor to benefit from the redistributions.91

Why do redistribution systems develop? Elman Service suggested that they develop in agricultural societies that contain subregions suited to different kinds of crops or natural resources. Foragers can take advantage of environmental variation by moving to different areas. With agriculture, the task is more difficult; it might be easier to move different products across different regions.92 If the demand for different resources or products becomes too great, reciprocity between individuals might become awkward. So it might be more efficient to have someone—a chief, perhaps—coordinate the exchanges.

Marvin Harris agreed that redistribution becomes more likely with agriculture, but for a somewhat different reason. He argued that competitive feasting, as in New Guinea, is adaptive because it encourages people to work harder to produce somewhat more than they need. Why would this feature be adaptive? Harris argued that, with agriculture, people really have to produce more than they need so that they can protect themselves against crises such as crop failure. The groups that make feasts may be indirectly ensuring themselves against crises by storing up social credit with other villages, who will reciprocate by making feasts for them in the future. On the other hand, inducements to collect more than they need may not be advantageous to food-collecting groups, who might lose in the long run by overcollecting.93

#### Market or Commercial Exchange

When we think of markets, we usually think of bustling, colorful places where goods are bought and sold. The exchanges usually involve money. In our own society, we have supermarkets and the stock market and other places for buying and selling that we call shops, stores, and malls. In referring to **market** or **commercial exchange,** economists and economic anthropologists are referring to exchanges or transactions in which the "prices" are subject to supply and demand, whether or not the transactions actually occur in a marketplace.94 Market exchange involves not only the exchange (buying and selling) of goods but also transactions of labor, land, rentals, and credit.

On the surface, many market exchanges resemble balanced reciprocity. One person gives something and receives something in return. How, then, does market exchange differ from balanced reciprocity? It is easy to distinguish market exchange from balanced reciprocity when money is directly involved, because reciprocity is defined as not involving money. But market exchange need not always involve money directly.95 For example, a landowner grants a tenant farmer the right to use the land in exchange for a portion of the crop. So, to call a transaction market exchange, we have to ask whether supply and demand determine the price. If a tenant farmer gave only a token gift to the landowner, we would not call it market exchange, just as a Christmas gift to a teacher is not payment for teaching. If tenants, however, are charged a large portion of their crops when the supply of land is short, or if landowners lower their demands when few people want to tenant-farm, then we would call the transactions market or commercial exchange. The forces of supply and demand create considerable risk for those dependent on monetary exchange for life's necessities. A wage earner who loses a job may not be able to afford food or shelter; a farmer relying on a cash crop may not get a price sufficient to support the family. Societies with monetary exchange usually have considerable inequities in wealth and power.

Kinds of Money Although market exchange need not involve money, most commercial transactions, particularly nowadays, do involve what we call money. Some anthropologists define money according to the functions and characteristics of the **general-purpose money** used in our own and other complex societies, for which nearly all goods, resources, and services can be exchanged. According to this definition, money performs the basic functions of serving as an accepted medium of exchange, a standard of value, and a store of wealth. As a medium of exchange, it allows all goods and services to be valued in the same objective way; we say that an object or service is worth so much money. Also, money is nonperishable and therefore savable or storable, and it is almost always transportable and divisible, so transactions can involve the buying and selling of goods and services that differ in value.

Although money can technically be anything, the first money systems used rare metals such as gold and silver. These metals are relatively soft and therefore can be melted and shaped into standard sizes and weights. The earliest standardized coins we know of are said to have been made by the Lydians in Asia Minor and the Chinese in the 7th century a.d. It is important to realize that money has little or no intrinsic value; rather, it is society that determines its value. In the United States today, paper bills, bank checks, and credit and debit cards are fully accepted as money, and money is increasingly transferred electronically.

General-purpose money is used both for commercial transactions (buying and selling) and for noncommercial transactions (payment of taxes or fines, personal gifts, contributions to religious and other charities). General-purpose money provides a way **Market (or commercial) exchange** Transactions in which the "prices" are subject to supply and demand, whether or not the transactions occur in a marketplace.

**General-purpose money** A universally accepted medium of exchange.

**Special-purpose money** Objects of value for which only some goods and services can be exchanged.

of condensing wealth: Gold dust or nuggets are easier to carry around than bushels of wheat; paper bills, a checkbook, and plastic cards are handier than a herd of sheep or goats.

In many societies, money is not an all-purpose medium of exchange. Many peoples whose food production per capita is not sufficient to support a large population of nonproducers of food have **special-purpose money**. This consists of objects of value for which only some goods and services can be exchanged on the spot or through balanced reciprocity. In some parts of Melanesia, pigs are assigned value in terms of shell money lengths of shells strung together in units each roughly as long as the distance covered by a man's outstretched arms. According to its size, a pig will be assigned a value in tens of such units up to 100.96 But shell money cannot be exchanged for all the goods or services a person might need. Similarly, a Pacific Northwest native could exchange food, but not most other goods and services, for a "gift of wealth," such as blankets. The gift was a "receipt" that entitled the person to receive an equal amount of food, but little else, later.

Degrees of Commercialization Most societies were not commercialized at all, or only barely so, when first described in the ethnographic record by explorers, missionaries, and anthropologists. That is, most societies as first described did not rely on market or commercial exchange to distribute goods and services. But commercial exchange has become the dominant form of distribution in the modern world. Most societies of the ethnographic past are now incorporated into larger nation-states; for example, the Trobriand Islanders and other societies in Melanesia are now districts in the nation of Papua New Guinea. Selling today goes far beyond the nation-state. The world is now a multinational market.97

But there is considerable variation in the degree to which societies today depend on market or commercial exchange. Many societies still allocate land without purchase and distribute food and other goods primarily by reciprocity and redistribution, participating only peripherally in market exchange. These are societies in transition; their traditional subsistence economies are becoming commercialized. Among the Luo of western Kenya, for example, most rural families still have land that their kin groups allocated to them. The food they eat they mostly produce themselves. But many men also work for wages—some nearby, others far away in towns and cities, where they spend a year or two. These wages are used to pay government taxes, to pay for children's schooling, and to

buy commercially produced items, such as clothes, kerosene lamps, radios, fish from Lake Nyanza, tea, sugar, and coffee. Occasionally, families sell agricultural surpluses or craft items such as reed mats. Economies such as that of the rural Luo are not fully commercialized, but they may become so in the future.

What anthropologists call *peasant economies* are somewhat more commercialized than transitional subsistence economies, such as that of the Luo. Although **peasants** also produce food largely for their own consumption, they regularly sell part of their surplus (food, other goods, or labor) to others, and land is one of the commodities they buy, rent, and sell. But although their production is somewhat commercialized, peasants are still not like the fully commercialized farmers in industrialized societies, who rely on the market to exchange all or almost all of their crops for all or almost all of the goods and services they need.

In fully commercialized societies such as our own, market or commercial exchange dominates the economy; prices and wages are regulated, or at least significantly affected, by the forces of supply and demand. A modern industrial or post-industrial economy may involve international as well as national markets in which everything—natural resources, labor, goods, services, prestige items, religious and ceremonial items—has a price, stated in the same money terms. Reciprocity is reserved for family members and friends or remains behind the scenes in business transactions. Redistribution, however, is an important mechanism. It is practiced in the form of taxation and the use of public revenue for transfer payments and other benefits to low-income families—welfare, Social Security, health care, and so on. But commercial exchange is the major way goods and services are distributed.

Why Do Money and Market Exchange Develop? Most economists think that money is invented in a society, or copied from another society, when trade increases and barter becomes increasingly inefficient. The more important or frequent trade is, the more difficult it is to find a person who can give something you want and wants something you have to give. Money makes it easy to trade. It is a valuable that may be exchanged for *anything,* and so it is an efficient medium of exchange when trade becomes important. In contrast, many anthropologists do not link the origins of money or market exchange to the necessities of trade. Instead, they link the origins of money to various noncommercial "payments," such as the *kula* valuables and the taxes that have to be paid to a political authority. All of the available explanations of money suggest that money will be found mostly in societies at higher levels of economic development; and indeed it is. When simpler societies have money, dominant and more complex societies have usually introduced it.98 In the next major section, we discuss more fully the impact of colonialism and global markets on societies that were not so long ago subsistence economies.

Most theories about the development of money and market exchange assume that producers have regular surpluses they want to exchange. But why do people produce surpluses in the first place? Perhaps they are motivated to produce extra only when they want to obtain goods from a distance and the suppliers of such goods are not well known to them, making reciprocity less likely as a way to obtain those goods. So some theorists suggest that market exchange begins with external, or intersocietal, trade; kin would not likely be involved, so transactions would involve bargaining and therefore are market exchange, by definition. Finally, some argue that as societies become more complex and more densely populated, social bonds between individuals become less kinlike and friendly, and therefore reciprocity becomes less likely.99 Perhaps this is why traders in developing areas are often foreigners or recent immigrants.100

In any case, Frederic Pryor's cross-cultural research supports the notion that all types of market exchange—goods, labor, land, and credit—are more likely with higher levels of economic productivity. Pryor also found that market exchange of goods appears at lower levels of economic development than market exchange of labor and credit; market exchange of land, probably because it is associated with private property (individual ownership), appears mostly at the highest levels of productivity. Perhaps surprisingly, smaller societies tend to have more market exchange or trade with other societies. Larger societies can presumably get more of what they need from inside the society; for example, until recently, China had relatively little foreign trade throughout much of its history.<sup>101</sup>

**Peasants** Rural people who produce food for their own subsistence but who must also contribute or sell their surpluses to others (in towns and cities) who do not produce their own food.

Fiesta sponsors spend a great deal of money for food and drink as well as for musicians and dancers. Shown is the annual religious fiesta of the Zapotec Indian village of Teotitlan del Valle, Oaxaca, Mexico.

#### Possible Leveling Devices in Commercial Economies In

societies that depend substantially on market or commercial exchange, some people tend to have more wealth than others have. Nevertheless, societies also have practices that may lessen the inequality and at least partially act as leveling devices. Some anthropologists have suggested that the fiesta tradition in highland Indian communities of Latin America may be a practice that tends to equalize income.102 In these peasant villages, annual fiestas are held to celebrate the Christian saints the villagers most revere. A remarkable feature of the fiesta system is the extraordinary amount of money and labor a sponsoring family must contribute. Sponsors must hire ritual specialists; pay for church services, musicians, and costumes for dancers; and cover the total cost of food and drink for the entire community. The costs incurred can very easily amount to a year's wages.<sup>103</sup>

Still other anthropologists argue that fiestas do not really level wealth at all. First, true economic leveling would entail the redistribution of important productive resources such as land or animals; the fiesta only temporarily increases the general level of consumption. Second, the resources the sponsors expend are usually extra resources that have been accumulated specifically for the fiesta, which is why the sponsors are always appointed in advance. Third, and perhaps most important, the fiestas do not seem to have reduced long-term wealth distinctions within the villages.104

In nations such as ours, can the income tax and the socialassistance programs it pays for, such as welfare and disaster relief, be thought of as leveling devices? Theoretically, our tax system is supposed to work that way, by taxing higher incomes at higher rates. But we know that, in fact, it doesn't. Those in higher income brackets can often deduct an appreciable amount from their taxable incomes and therefore pay taxes at a relatively low rate. Our tax sys-

tem may help some to escape extreme poverty, but, like the fiesta system, it has not eliminated marked distinctions in wealth.

16.4 Discuss the worldwide trend toward commercialization and its social effects.

## The Worldwide Trend Toward Commercialization

One of the most important changes resulting from the expansion of Western societies and the capitalist system is the increasingly worldwide dependence on commercial exchange. The borrowed customs of buying and selling may at first be supplementary to traditional means of distributing goods in a society. As new commercial customs take hold, however, the economic base of the receiving society alters. Inevitably, social, political, and even biological and psychological changes accompany such a change.

When examining contemporary examples of change resulting from commercialization, it is important to remember that the phenomenon has ancient roots. Some early state societies, including the Chinese, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Phoenicians, and Hindus, practiced commercial exchange, and their influence was felt well beyond their own territories. We may cast some light on how and why earlier cultures changed when we consider several questions: How, and why, does a contemporary society change from a subsistence to a commercial economic base? What are the resultant cultural changes? Why do they occur?

In general, the limited evidence available suggests that a previously noncommercial people may begin to sell and buy things simply to live, not just because they may be attracted by goods they can obtain only by commercial exchange. If the resources available to a group have been significantly reduced per person—because the group has been forced to resettle on a small "reservation" or because population has increased—the group may be likely to take

advantage of any commercial opportunities that become available, even if such opportunities require considerably more work, time, and effort.105

Many anthropologists have noted that with the introduction of money, customs of sharing seem to change dramatically. Money, perhaps because it is nonperishable and largely hideable, tends to invoke feelings of not wanting to share. The plight of a man from the central highlands of New Guinea is typical. He agrees that it is not good manners to refuse a request from a relative or village friend; nonetheless, to keep his income from being "eaten," he tries to conceal some of his income. Some of the strategies include opening a savings account into which his pay is deposited, purchasing a semipermanent house, or joining a revolving credit association.106 A recent series of experiments in the United States, where money has always been fundamental to the economic system, suggests that even the mere reminder of money causes people to behave more independently and to be less helpful to others.<sup>107</sup>

#### Migratory Labor

One way commercialization can occur is for some members of a community to move to a place that offers the possibility of working for wages. This happened in Tikopia, an island near the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific. In 1929, when Raymond Firth first studied the island, its economy was still essentially noncommercial—simple, self-sufficient, and largely self-contained.108 Some Western goods were available but, with the exception of iron and steel in limited quantities, not sought after. Their possession and use were associated solely with Europeans. This situation changed dramatically with World War II. During the war, military forces occupied neighboring islands, and people from Tikopia migrated to those islands to find employment. In the period following the war, several large commercial interests extended their activities in the Solomons, thus creating a continued demand for labor. As a result, when Firth revisited Tikopia in 1952, he found the economic situation already significantly altered. More than 100 Tikopians had left the

island to work for varying periods. The migrants wanted to earn money because they aspired to standards of living previously regarded as appropriate only to Europeans. Already, living conditions on Tikopia were changing. Western cooking and water-carrying utensils, mosquito nets, kerosene storm lamps, and so forth had come to be regarded as normal items in a Tikopia household.

The introduction of money into the economy of Tikopia not only altered the economic system but also affected other areas of life. Compared with the situation in 1929, land was under more intensive cultivation in 1952, with introduced manioc and sweet potatoes supplementing the old principal crop, taro. Pressures on the food supply resulting from improved living standards and an increased population seem to have weakened the ties of extended kinship. For example, the nuclear families constituting the extended family (the landholding and land-using unit in 1929) were not cooperating as much in 1952. In many cases, in fact, the land had actually been split up among the constituent nuclear families; land rights had become more individualized. People were no longer as willing to share with members of their extended family, particularly with respect to the money and goods acquired by working in the Solomons.

In many areas of the world, the money sent back home has become a major factor in the economy (see the box "Working Abroad to Send Money Home"). Often remittances are not sent through the formal banking system but rather through an informal network of brokers. In the Middle East and South Asia, the system is called *hawala* and is based on an honor system. For instance, the Hazara, the third largest ethnic group in Afghanistan, have migrated throughout the 20th century to cities in Afghanistan as well as to Pakistan and Iran. The banks in Afghanistan are not functioning, and the Hazara often do not have official identification papers, so they use *hawala* brokers to transfer money back home.109 The money from remittances often far exceeds the money spent by development efforts.110 But unlike development efforts, usually supported by wealthier countries, money received by remittances can be channeled where families want. Migration becomes part of a family's economic strategy. Of course, not all families can employ that strategy the poorest families cannot afford the costs of long-distance migration.111

#### Nonagricultural Commercial Production

Commercialization can also occur when a self-sufficient society comes to depend more and more on trading for its livelihood. Such a change is exemplified by the Mundurucú of the Amazon Basin, who largely abandoned general horticulture for commercial rubber production. A similar change may also be seen in the Montagnais of northeastern Canada, who came to depend increasingly on commercial fur trapping, rather than hunting, for subsistence. Robert Murphy and Julian Steward found that when modern goods from industrialized areas became available through trade, both the Mundurucú and the Montagnais devoted their energies to producing specialized cash crops or other trade items. They did this to obtain other industrially made objects.112 The primary socioeconomic change that occurred among the Mundurucú and the Montagnais was a shift from cooperative labor and community autonomy to individualized economic activity and a dependence on an external market.

Among the Mundurucú, for example, before close trading links were established, the native population and the Europeans had been in contact for some 80 years without the Mundurucú way of life being noticeably altered. The men did give up their independent military activities to perform as mercenaries for the Brazilians, but they continued to maintain their horticultural economy. Some trading took place with Brazilians, with the chief acting as agent for the village. Barter was the method of exchange. Traders first distributed their wares, ranging from cheap cottons to iron hatchets, trinkets, and so on; they returned about three months later to collect manioc, India rubber, and beans from the Mundurucú. At this time (1860), however, rubber was only a secondary item of commerce.

The rapidly growing demand for rubber from the 1860s onward increased the importance of Mundurucú-trader relationships. Traders now openly began to appoint agents, called *capitoes,* whose job it was to encourage greater rubber production. *Capitoes* were given economic privileges and hence power, both of which began to undercut the

## **Migrants and Immigrants**

### **Working Abroad to Send Money Home**

hroughout recorded history, people have been going to other places to make a living. They do it not only to support themselves but also to support their families back home. Indeed, the people left behind might suffer terribly, or even starve, without these remittances, the term economists use when referring to the money people send back home. People who went to another country to work generated more than \$440 billion in remittances in 2010.

In the 19th century, men from China were recruited to come to North America to build the transcontinental railroads, and Italians were recruited to work on building the railroads in New York State, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. In the years after World War II, when West German businesses were short of labor because so many people had been killed in the war, men from Turkey were recruited to come to Germany to fill the available jobs. Now, 30 to 40 years later, they make up a sizeable proportion of the population. Most if not all of the labor-short countries in western Europe (including England and France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Italy, and Spain) have attracted considerable numbers of immigrants in recent years. Indeed, much like the United States before them, the countries of western Europe are now becoming quite diverse culturally.

We may think that many if not most immigrants want to stay in the countries they have moved to. But this was not always true in the past, and it is not always true today. Many in the past just wanted to stay a few

years. They wanted to earn money to help relatives back home, and maybe (if they were lucky) they could earn enough money to return home themselves and buy a farm or other small business. They often didn't become citizens in the new country because they didn't intend to stay. But until recently, most immigrants never went home again, and by the second or third generation, they had lost their native languages. In the last few decades, people who move to other countries to work often go home again—and again and again. They have become "transnationals," fluent in at least two languages and comfortable living in different countries alternately. They may even retain two (or more) citizenships. Consider how different this is from many past immigrants who were highly motivated to "pass." It is not clear yet what explains why some people are more

comfortable now with not passing. Could it be that some places are less ethnocentric than in the past? If so, why is that?

Not all moves to another country turn out well for the migrants. Consider the poor young women from Sri Lanka who are recruited to work as housemaids in other countries. They may be burned or beaten if their work is deemed unacceptable, and they may return home with no money saved from their work time abroad. One in every 19 citizens of Sri Lanka now works abroad, most of them as housemaids. For a country like Sri Lanka, migration has become a safety valve for the economy. The Sri Lankan economy may be advantaged by the remittances received, but not without suffering for some of the migrants.

position of the traditional chief. In addition, the process of rubber collection itself began to alter Mundurucú social patterns by moving people away from their jungle-based communities.

Wild rubber trees are found only along rivers, which are often a considerable distance from the jungle habitat of the Mundurucú and can be exploited only during the dry season (late May to December). So the Mundurucú man who elected to gather rubber

had to separate himself from his family for about half the year. Furthermore, rubber collecting is a solitary activity. Each tapper must daily work his territory, consisting of about 150 trees, and he must live close to his trees because the work lasts all day. Therefore, the tapper usually lives alone or in a small group except during the rainy season, when he returns to his village.

At this stage in the commercialization process, the Mundurucú became increasingly dependent on goods the trader supplied. Firearms were useless without regular quantities of gun powder and lead or shot; clothing required needles and thread for repairs. But these items could be earned only through increased rubber production, which in turn led to greater dependency on the outside world. Inevitably, the ability to work with traditional materials and the desire to maintain traditional crafts disappeared. Metal pots took the place of clay ones, and manufactured hammocks replaced homemade ones. Gradually, the village agricultural cycle ceased to be followed by all in the community so that rubber production would not suffer. The authority of the traditional chiefs was weakened as that of the *capitoes* was enhanced.

The point of no return was reached when significant numbers of Mundurucú abandoned the villages for permanent settlements near their individual territories of trees. These new settlements lacked the unity, the sense of community, of former village life. Nuclear families held and carefully maintained property in the interest of productivity.

With the discovery of gold, many Mundurucú young men have turned to panning for gold in rivers. The required equipment is simple, and gold is easier to transport and trade than rubber. Because gold can be sold for cash, which is then used for purchases, trading relationships are no longer so important. Cash is now used to buy transistor radios, tape recorders, watches, bicycles, and new kinds of clothing, in addition to firearms, metal pots, and tools. With money as a medium of exchange, the traditional emphasis on reciprocity has declined. Even food may now be sold to fellow Mundurucú, a practice that would have been unthinkable in the 1950s.113

#### Supplementary Cash Crops

A third way commercialization occurs is when people cultivating the soil produce a surplus above their subsistence requirements, which is then sold for cash. In many cases, this cash income must be used to pay rent or taxes. Under these circumstances, commercialization may be said to be associated with the formation of a peasantry.

Peasants first appeared with the emergence of state and urban civilizations about 5,000 years to 6,000 years ago, and they have been associated with civilization ever since.114 To say that peasants are associated with urban societies perhaps needs some qualification. The contemporary, highly industrialized urban society has little need of peasants. Their scale of production is small and their use of land "uneconomic." A highly industrialized society with a large population of nonfood producers requires mechanized agriculture. As a result, the peasant has passed, or is passing, out of all but the most peripheral existence in industrial countries.

What changes does the development of a peasantry entail? In some respects, there is little disturbance of the cultivator's (now peasant's) former way of life. The peasant still has to produce enough food to meet family needs, to replace what has been consumed, and to cover a few ceremonial obligations (e.g., the marriage of a child, village festivals, and funerals). But in other respects, the peasant's situation is radically altered. For, in addition to the traditional obligations—indeed, often in conflict with them—the peasant now has to produce extra crops to meet the requirements of a group of outsiders landlords or officials of the state. These outsiders expect to be paid rent or taxes in produce or currency, and they are able to enforce their expectations because they control the military and the police.

#### Introduction of Commercial and Industrial Agriculture

Commercialization can come about through the introduction of commercial agriculture, cultivation for sale rather than personal consumption. The system of agriculture may come to be industrialized. In other words, some of the production processes, such as plowing,

#### Impact of the World System—Deforestation of the Amazon

he great rain forest drained by the Amazon River and its tributaries covers more than a billion acres. The Amazon forest is not only the home to many largely selfsufficient indigenous cultures; it also supports about 20 percent of all the earth's plant and animal species. The vast forests absorb  $CO_2$ , which helps to reduce global warming. The forest also puts needed moisture into the atmosphere through evaporation about 8 trillion tons of water a year. Global warming will lead to reduced rainfall, putting stress on the ability of the forest to grow or the existing trees to survive.

The Amazon forest and other tropical forests have been disappearing at an alarming rate because of the accelerated clearing of forest by humans, primarily for ranching and farming. About 15 percent of the Amazon forests have already been cleared. Some have suggested that the world demand for wood, hamburger, and crops for biofuels is largely responsible for the diminution of the Amazon forest. Like many tropical forests, the Amazon has large numbers of desirable hardwood trees. Forests in Africa and Asia are already largely depleted, so the demand for wood from the Amazon has grown considerably. In addition, the Amazon Development Agency in Brazil has offered incentives to clear forest for cattle ranching, which can provide hamburger to fast-food restaurants.

Clearing land for crops has increased because of the need for food for cattle and for production of crops suitable for biofuels.

The indigenous people often find themselves in a land squeeze, with loggers, cattle ranchers, and miners trying to encroach on their territory. With less land, food-getting and traditional economic practices are in jeopardy. But it is naive to assume that the indigenous people are interested only in maintaining their traditional economies. They often accept the dilemma of economic development: They might lose some land, but selling rights to loggers and miners brings in money, which they can use to buy things they need and want. And indigenous people themselves, although they contribute relatively little to the direct deforestation that is occurring, are increasingly involved in the world market economy. Researchers studying the Tsimane of the Bolivian lowlands, mainly foragers who also farm, have found that those who grow a cash crop are most likely to clear more forest.

Development experts and applied anthropologists are searching for ways to achieve development without destroying or degrading the environment. For example, indigenous groups are encouraged to gather Brazil nuts, a wild but renewable resource, for sale. Others are encouraged to harvest latex (natural rubber) and hearts of palm. Medicinal plants have economic value to multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnical companies, which have discovered that the conservation of biodiversity may be economically advantageous to themselves as well as to the local people and to scientists who want to study the diversity. The countries with large portions of Amazon forest have played an important role in encouraging development but have worked to reduce deforestation with international pressure. For example, in Brazil, the annual rate of forest clearing declined between 2005 and 2010 because of the intervention of the Brazilian government. The international community is also working on a plan that would encourage countries to reduce deforestation, perhaps in exchange for monetary credits.

Can development be sustainable? Whether we like it or not, economic development and the desire for it are not going to go away. But we need to do more than applaud or bemoan economic development. In particular, we need more research that reveals what impact particular changes will have on people, other animals, plants, and the environment. Most of all, for the sake of human rights, we need to listen to the people whose lives will be most affected, to understand their needs as well as those of the developers.

weeding, irrigation, and harvesting, can be done by machine. Commercial agriculture is, in fact, often as mechanized as any manufacturing industry. Land is worked for the maximum return it will yield, and labor is hired and fired just as impersonally as in other industries.

E. J. Hobsbawm noted some of the developments that accompanied the introduction of commercial agriculture in 18th-century England and in continental Europe somewhat later.<sup>115</sup> The close, near-familial relationship between farmer and farm laborer disappeared, as did the once-personal connection between landlord and tenant. Land came to be regarded as a source of profit rather than a way of life. Fields were merged into single units and enclosed, and local grazing and similar privileges were reduced. Labor was hired at market rates and paid in wages. Eventually, as the emphasis on large-scale production for a mass market increased, machines began to replace farmers.

The introduction of commercial agriculture brings several important social consequences. Gradually, a class polarization develops. Farmers and landlords become increasingly separated from laborers and tenants, just as the employer in town becomes socially separated from the employees. Gradually, too, manufactured items of all sorts are introduced into rural areas. Laborers migrate to urban centers in search of employment, often meeting even less sympathetic conditions there than exist in the country.

The changeover to commercial agriculture may result in an improved standard of living in the short and long run. But sometimes the switch is followed by a decline in the standard of living if the market price for the commercial crop declines. For example, the changeover of the farmer-herders of the arid *sertão* region of northeastern Brazil after 1940 to the production of sisal (a plant whose fibers can be made into twine and rope) seemed to be a move that could provide a more secure living in their arid environment. But when the world price for sisal dropped and the wages of sisal workers declined, many workers were forced to curtail the caloric intake of their children. The poorer people were obliged to save their now more limited food supplies for the money earners, at the expense of the children.116

Commercialization can start in various ways: People can begin to sell and buy because they begin to work near home or away for wages, or because they begin to sell nonagricultural products, surplus food, or cash crops (crops grown deliberately for sale). One type of commercialization does not exclude another; all types can occur in any society. However commercialization begins, it seems to have predictable effects on traditional economics. The ethic of generalized reciprocity declines, particularly with respect to giving away money. (Perhaps because it is nonperishable and hideable, money seems more likely than other goods to be kept for one's immediate family rather than shared with others.) Property rights become individualized rather than collective when people begin to buy and sell. Even in societies that were previously egalitarian, commercialization usually results in more unequal access to resources and hence a greater degree of social stratification.

## Summary and Review

## The Allocation of Resources

16.1 Compare and contrast the allocation of resources among foragers, horticulturalists, intensive agriculturalists, and pastoralists and discuss how colonialism and the state have affected that allocation.

- • Every society has access to natural resources—land, water, plants, animals, minerals—and cultural rules for determining who has access to particular resources. Societies differ in their rules for land access, but the differences generally relate to a society's food-getting method.
- • In food-collecting societies individual or family ownership of land is generally lacking. If there is ownership, it is tends to be by collective groups such as kinship groups or through communities. Territoriality is stronger when the plants and animals collected are predictably located and abundant.

- • Horticulturalist societies also tend to lack individual or family ownership, probably because their technologies do not enable them to effectively use the same land permanently, but they are more likely to assign individuals or families use of a particular plot of land.
- • Pastoralists often combine the adaptive habits of both foragers and horticulturalists because they need large territories for grazing herds. While they tend to hold grazing land communally, pastoralists customarily own their herds individually.
- • Individual ownership of land resources is common among intensive agriculturalists. However, some communist and socialist nations undertake intensive agriculture by forming state-run agricultural collectives.
- • Almost universally worldwide, colonial conquerors and settlers from expanding state societies have taken land from the native people. Typically, state authorities do not like communal land-use systems and see mobile pastoralists as difficult to control.

• Every society has a technology, a set of tools, constructions, and skills with which it converts resources into food and other goods. Technological access varies, generally being widespread among forager and horticultural societies, but not among industrial or postindustrial societies.

> How has the worldwide phenomenon of colonialism and the effects of statehood affected land rights?

## The Conversion of Resources

16.2 Explain the different types of economic production and economic exchange and their effect on labor.

- • Production is the conversion of resources through labor into food, tools, and other goods.
- • In domestic production, the family controls conversion of resources. In tributary production, people pay a tribute of labor or goods to an authority for access to land. In industrial production, people labor as wage earners. In post-industrial production, information and services are the main products.
- • People in subsistence economies with a domestic mode of production often work less than people in commercial economies with tributary or industrial modes of production and tend not to produce more than they need.
- • People may be motivated to work harder than they have to for subsistence to gain social respect or esteem or to satisfy a need for achievement, especially in commercial economies.
- • Forms of forced labor are found in more complex societies and can be indirect (taxation and corvée) or direct (slavery).
- • Many societies divide labor only by gender and age; other societies have more complex specialization. Horticultural societies may have some part-time specialists. Societies with intensive agriculture have some full-time specialists, and industrialized societies have many.
- • In many food-collecting and horticultural societies, there is little formal organization of work. The need to coordinate labor is highest in industrialized societies.
- • Optimal foraging theory assumes that individuals seek to maximize the returns, in calories and nutrients, on their labor by deciding which animals and plants to hunt or collect.

What are the different types of economic production? Looking at different aspects of labor, how do they vary with type of society?

### The Distribution of Goods and Services

16.3 Explain the three general types of systems for distributing goods and services (reciprocity, redistribution, and market or commercial exchange).

- • Goods and services are distributed in all societies under three general types of systems: reciprocity, redistribution, and market or commercial exchange, each of which is associated with a society's food-getting technology and level of economic development.
- • Reciprocity systems do not involve money. Sharing may (a) create social relationships that ensure help when needed, (b) equalize distribution of goods within and between communities, and (c) be most likely when resources are unpredictable.
- • In redistribution systems, one person or agency accumulates goods or labor for the purpose of later distribution. Redistribution is found in all societies but is an important mechanism only in societies that have political hierarchies.
- • Market or commercial exchange involves the buying and selling of goods and transactions of labor, land, rentals, and credit. General-purpose money provides an objective value for all goods and services. Specialpurpose money can be used for only some goods and services.
- • Societies may begin to use money when trade and barter increases or when political authorities demand noncommercial fees such as taxes. Social bonds between individuals may become less kinlike in more complex and populated societies, making reciprocity less likely.

What are the major ways of distributing goods and services, and how do they relate to a society's food-getting technology?

## The Worldwide Trend Toward Commercialization

16.4 Discuss the worldwide trend toward commercialization and explain its social effects.

• The expansion of Western societies and the capitalist system has led to an increasingly worldwide dependence on commercial exchange. Inevitably, social, political, and even biological and psychological changes accompany such a change.

#### 368 PART IV Cultural Variation

- • Many anthropologists have noted that with the introduction of money, customs of sharing seem to change dramatically.
- • Commercialization can occur when some society members move to places that offer possible work for wages, when a self-sufficient society increasingly depends on trading, and when people cultivating crops produce a surplus sell it for cash.
- • Commercial systems of agriculture may become industrialized. The introduction of commercial agriculture brings several important social consequences, including class polarization.

What are examples of social, political, biological, and psychological changes that might occur as a result of dependence on commercial exchange?

## Think on it

- 1. What conditions might enable us to achieve a world of sustainable resources?
- 2. What are the possible effects of a post-industrial economy in which a large proportion of the population has inexpensive access to computers and information?
- 3. Do you expect the amount of privately owned resources to change appreciably in the future? State your reasons.
- 4. What might be the beneficial consequences of the worldwide trend toward commercialization?
- 5. Why might an increasing understanding of cultural variation also provide an increasing understanding of cultural change?
