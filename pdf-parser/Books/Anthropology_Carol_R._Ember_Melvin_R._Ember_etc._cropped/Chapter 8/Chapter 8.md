Recent finds in Africa indicate the presence of *Homo sapiens* perhaps 160,000 years ago (see Figure 8.1). Completely modern 1. 1 (see Figure 8.1). Completely modern-looking humans, appeared by 50,000 years ago. One paleoanthropologist, Christopher Stringer, characterizes, *Homo sapiens*, as having "a domed skull, a chin, small eyebrows, browridges, and a rather puny skeleton."<sup>1</sup> Some of us might not like to be called puny, but except for our larger brain, most modern humans definitely are puny compared with *Homo erectus* and even with earlier forms of *H. sapiens*. We are relatively puny in several respects, including our thinner and lighter bones as well as our smaller teeth and jaws.

In this chapter, we discuss the fossil evidence, as well as the controversies, about the transition from *H. erectus* to modern humans, which may have begun 500,000 years ago. We also discuss what we know archaeologically about the Middle Paleolithic cultures between about 300,000 and 40,000 years ago.

#### 8.1 Discuss the

anatomical characteristics of the Neandertals and the relationship between Neandertals and Homo sapiens.

#### Homo heidelbergensis

A transitional species between Homo erectus and Homo sapiens.

#### Homo antecessor

Refers to a group of homin fossils found in the Atapuerca region of Spain that appear to be transitional between Neandertals and modern humans. They are closely related to Homo heidelbergensis, and many scholars believe they are the same species.

## The Transition from Homo erectus to Homo sapiens

Most paleoanthropologists agree that  $H$ . *erectus* evolved into  $H$ . *sapiens*, but they disagree about how and where the transition occurred. There is also disagreement about how to classify some fossils from about 500,000 years to 200,000 years ago that have a mix of  $H.$  erectus and  $H.$  sapiens traits.<sup>2</sup> A particular fossil might be called  $H.$  erectus by some anthropologists and "archaic" *Homo sapiens* by others. And, as we shall see, still other anthropologists see so much continuity between  $H$ . *erectus* and  $H$ . *sapiens* that they think it is completely arbitrary to call them different species. According to these anthropologists, H. erectus and H. sapiens may just be earlier and later varieties of the same species and therefore all should be called  $H$ . sapiens. ( $H$ . erectus would then be  $H$ . sapiens erectus.)

#### Homo heidelbergensis

In recent years, some scholars have suggested that the "transitional" fossils share common traits and may actually represent a separate speciesâ€”*Homo heidelbergensis*, named after a jaw found in 1907 in the village of Mauer near Heidelberg, Germany.<sup>3</sup> Other specimens that have been suggested as members of this species have been found in many parts of the world: Bodo, Hopefield, Ndutu, Elandsfontein, and Rabat in Africa; Bilzingsleben, Petralona, Arago, Steinheim, and Swanscombe in Europe; and Dali and Solo in Asia. More recently discovered "transitional" specimens from the Atapuerca region of Spain have been classified as a different species, *Homo antecessor*, but many scholars believe these specimens should be classified as *H. heidelbergensis*.<sup>4</sup> To simplify things, we will call all these "transitional" specimens H. heidelbergensis.

*Homo heidelbergensis* differs from *Homo erectus* in having smaller teeth and jaws, a much larger brain (on the order of  $1,300$  cc), a skull that lacks a sagittal keel and occipital torus, a browridge that divides into separate arches above each eye, and a more robust skeleton (see Figure 8.2). *Homo heidelbergensis* differs from *Homo sapiens* in retaining a large and prognathic face with relatively large teeth and jaws; a browridge; a long, low cranial vault with a sloping forehead; and in its more robust skeleton.<sup>5</sup>

Many scholars question whether *Homo heidelbergensis* represents one or several species of Middle Pleistocene hominin, or whether it is indeed a separate species at all. Many would

argue that *Homo heidelbergensis* should be considered an archaic *Homo sapiens*. As noted, some scholars also argue that *Homo erectus* should be included in the *Homo sapiens* species.

#### Neandertals: Homo sapiens or Homo neandertalensis?

There may be disagreement about how to classify the mixed-trait fossils from 500,000 to 200,000 years ago, but until about 10 years ago there was an outright battle about many of the fossils that are less than 200,000 years old. Some anthropologists argued that they were definitely *Homo sapiens* and classified them as *Homo sapiens neander*talensis. Other anthropologists argued that they were part of a distinct species, Homo *neandertalensis*, more commonly referred to as the **Neandertals**. The Neandertals have been a confusing hominin fossil group since the first specimen was found in 1856. Somehow through the years, the Neandertals have become the victims of their cartoon image, which usually misrepresents them as burly and more ape than human. Actually, they might go unnoticed in a cross-section of the world's population today

## **Applied Anthropology**

#### **Facial Reconstruction**

ave you ever wondered how we know what early humans looked like? The answer lies in the field of forensic anthropology and more particularly in the field of facial reconstruction.

Facial reconstruction is based on knowledge of skull musculature and the thickness of soft tissue, determined over many years (the first such analysis was done in 1895) from cadavers and, more recently, magnetic resonance images of living people. From these measurements, forensic anthropologists have established a standard set of 21 to 34 locations on the skull where the average soft tissue thicknesses are known. The first step in facial reconstruction is to mark these locations on a cast of the skull to be reconstructed, using pegs that are the same length as the thickness of muscle and soft tissue at that location. Clay is then used to cover the skull cast to the depth of these pegs (the musculature of the face is first modeled in more sophisticated reconstructions, then clay is used to represent the soft tissues, up to the depth of the pegs).

The size and shape of the nose are reconstructed based on the size and shape of the nasal opening. The size and shape of lips and ears are more difficult to determine, and the skull itself can tell the forensic anthropologist almost nothing about hair or eye color, whether the person had facial hair, or how the person's hair was cut. Those aspects of facial reconstruction require some artistic intuition, and it is helpful

to know something about the person, such as sex, age, and ethnicity.

But what about ancient humans? The standard measurements used to reconstruct faces from modern human skulls cannot be assumed to work for ancient skulls. For those, the forensic anthropologists have to go back to the basis of facial reconstructionmuscle and soft tissue. When reconstructing the faces of ancient humans, forensic anthropologists begin with a careful reconstruction of skull musculature, often aided by the comparative anatomy of modern great apes. Once the muscles are in place, glands, fatty

tissue, and skin are added, and the face begins to take shape.

Though based on study of the likely muscular anatomy in fossils and the comparative anatomy of modern humans and great apes, it is important to realize that the reconstruction of ancient faces is in part an artistic exercise. This is why reconstructions vary in the ways they depict ancient humans. We need to keep in mind when we look at reconstructions that they are educated, perhaps biased, guesses, and not necessarily true depictions of ancient people.

Boule's reconstruction of a Neandertal, as displayed at Chicago's Field Museum in 1929, illustrates how subjective fossil reconstructions can be. It falsely implies that Neandertals could not stand upright or straighten their knees, and that they were more primitive than we know today that they actually were.

(see the box on "Facial Reconstruction"). Were they part of our species? For a while, the answer seemed to be yes. But recent archaeological and genetic evidence has led most to question the relationship between Neandertals and modern humans. Let's take a look at some of the history of research on the Neandertals.

In 1856, three years before Darwin's publication of *Origin of Species*, a skullcap and other fossilized bones were discovered in a cave in the Neander Valley (*tal* is the German word for "valley"), near DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. The fossils in the Neander Valley were the first that scholars could tentatively consider as an early hominin. (The fossils classified as *Homo erectus* were not found until later in the 19th century, and the fossils belonging to the genus *Australopithecus* were not found until the 20th century.) After Darwin's revolutionary work was published, the Neandertal find aroused considerable controversy. A few evolutionist scholars, such as Thomas Huxley, thought that the Neandertal was not that different from modern humans. Others dismissed the Neandertal as irrelevant to human evolution; they saw it as a pathological freak, a peculiar, disease-ridden individual. However, similar fossils turned up later in Belgium, Yugoslavia, France, and elsewhere in Europe, which meant that the original Neandertal find could not be dismissed as an oddity.6

The predominant reaction to the original and subsequent Neandertallike finds was that the Neandertals were too "brutish" and "primitive" to have been ancestral to modern humans. This view prevailed in the scholarly community until well into the 1950s. A major proponent of this view was Marcellin Boule, who between 1908 and 1913, claimed that the Neandertals would not have been capable of complete bipedalism. Boule, however, misinterpreted the bowed legs and bent spine in the Neandertal skeleton he examinedâ€”these were not normal in Neandertals but were the result of disease in this particular individual. It is now universally agreed that the skeletal traits of the Neandertals are completely consistent with bipedalism.

Perhaps more important, when the much more ancient australopithecine and *H. erectus* fossils were accepted as hominins in the 1940s and 1950s, anthropologists realized that the Neandertals did not look that different from modern humansâ€”despite their sloping foreheads, large browridges, flattened braincases, large jaws, and nearly absent chins (see Figure 8.2).7 After all, they did have larger brains (averaging more than 1,450 cc) than modern humans (slightly more than 1,300 cc).8 Some scholars believe that the large brain capacity of Neandertals suggests that they were capable of the full range of behaviors characteristic of modern humans. Their skeletons did, however, attest to one behavioral trait markedly different from behaviors of most modern humans: Neandertals apparently made very strenuous use of their bodies.<sup>9</sup>

It took almost 100 years for scholars to accept the idea that Neandertals were not that different from modern humans and perhaps should be classified as *Homo sapiens neandertalensis.* But in the last decade, there has been a growing debate over whether the Neandertals in western Europe were ancestral to modern-looking people who lived later in western Europe, after about 40,000 years ago. Neandertals lived in other places besides western Europe. A large number of fossils from central Europe strongly resemble those from western Europe, although some features, such as a projecting midface, are less pronounced.10 Neandertals have also been found in southwestern Asia (Israel, Iraq) and Central Asia (Uzbekistan). One of the largest collections of Neandertal fossils comes from Shanidar cave in the mountains of northeastern Iraq, where Ralph Solecki unearthed the skeletons of nine individuals (see Figure 8.3).11

What has changed scholars' opinions of the Neandertals so that they are now most commonly seen as not belonging to the *Homo sapiens* group?

In 1997, a group of researchers from the United States and Germany published findings that forced a reconsideration of the Neandertals and their relationship to modern humans. These scholars reported that they had been able to extract mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA, which is DNA located in cellular structures called mitochondria and is different from the nuclear DNA that is the blueprint for our bodies) from the original Neandertal specimen found in 1856.<sup>12</sup> How similar is Neandertal mtDNA to modern human mtDNA? Not as similar as many scholars would have expected. Among individual modern humans, there are usually five to ten differences in the sequence of mtDNA examined by the U.S. and German researchers. Between modern humans and the Neandertal specimen, there tend to be about 25 differencesâ€”more than three times that among modern humans (see Figure 8.4). This suggested to the researchers that the ancestors of modern humans and the Neandertal must have diverged about 600,000 years ago.<sup>13</sup> If the last common ancestor of ours and the Neandertal lived that long ago, the Neandertal would be a much more distant relative than previously thought. This research has since been replicated with mtDNA from other Neandertal fossils.<sup>14</sup>

But mtDNA is only part of the story. After their success in sequencing mtDNA, anthropological geneticist Svante PÃ¤Ã¤bo and his colleagues began trying to recover and sequence nuclear DNA from Neandertals. After several setbacks, PÃ¤Ã¤bo and collaborators successfully sequenced the nuclear DNA from two female Neandertals.<sup>15</sup> Analysis of the Neandertal DNA has found that Neandertals and modern humans have identical versions of several genes that were thought to only be found in modern humans, and that the two species occasionally interbred.<sup>16</sup> Neandertals also had fair skin, and at least some had red hair.<sup>17</sup>

However, some significant differences between Neandertal and modern human nuclear DNA have also been identified. For example, Neandertals apparently lack the modern human version of *microcephalin*, a gene that is associated with brain development.<sup>18</sup> And initial analyses of the nuclear DNA suggest that the ancestral modern human and Neandertal populations split more than a half million years ago.<sup>19</sup>

Archaeological findings from Europe and the Near East also seem to indicate that Neandertals and the modern human were different species. It has been known for decades that both modern human and Neandertal fossils are found in the same locations in parts of the Levant, but recent improvements in dating technology and newly discovered fossils have even more clearly demonstrated that the two kinds of hominin coexisted. In fact, several caves in the Mount Carmel region of Israel contain both modern human and Neandertal occupations. The fact that these two groups of hominins coinhabited the Near East for perhaps as much as 30,000 years and did not interbreed or share much in the way of tool technology strongly suggests that the two are different species.20 And finds in Europe seem to corroborate that assessment. As early modern humans began moving into Europe, they appear to have displaced populations of Neandertals already living there. Sites with tools thought to be associated with Neandertals disappear throughout Europe as sites with tools thought to be associated with modern humans expand their range.21 Significantly, the area of Europe last colonized by modern humans (Iberia) contains the very latest Neandertal fossils yet found, dating to some 30,000 years ago.<sup>22</sup>

With all this evidence pointing to Neandertals not being part of the modern human species, why is there an ongoing debate? In part, this is because none of the evidence is conclusive, and much of it can be interpreted in alternate ways. Perhaps more important, however, Neandertal culture, typically referred to as Middle Paleolithic after the predominant tool technology, has some features that make it seem similar to the culture of early modern humans.

**Middle Paleolithic** The time period of the Mousterian stone tool tradition.

8.2 Describe the features of Middle Paleolithic cultures.

# Middle Paleolithic Cultures

The period of cultural history associated with the Neandertals is traditionally called the **Middle Paleolithic** in Europe and the Near East and dates from about 300,000 years to about 40,000 years ago.23 For Africa, the term *Middle Stone Age* is used instead of Middle Paleolithic. The tool assemblages from this period are generally referred to as Mousterian in Europe and the Near East.

#### Tool Assemblages

The Mousterian The Mousterian type of tool complex is named after the tool assemblage found in a rock shelter at Le Moustier in the Dordogne region of southwestern France. Compared with an Acheulian assemblage, a **Mousterian tool assemblage** has a smaller proportion of large core tools such as hand axes and cleavers and a bigger proportion of small flake tools such as scrapers.<sup>24</sup> Although many flakes struck off from a core were used "as is," the Mousterian is also characterized by flakes that were often altered or "retouched" by striking small flakes or chips from one or more edges (see Figure 8.5).25 Studies of the wear on scrapers suggest that many were used for scraping hides or working wood. The fact that some of the tools, particularly points, were thinned or shaped on one side suggests that they were hafted, or attached to a shaft or handle.<sup>26</sup>

Toward the end of the Acheulian period, a technique developed that enabled toolmakers to produce flake tools of a predetermined size instead of simply chipping flakes away from the

core at random. In this **Levalloisian method**, toolmakers first shaped the core and prepared a "striking platform" at one end. Flakes of predetermined and standard sizes could then be knocked off. Although some Levallois flakes date as far back as 400,000 years

ago, they are found more frequently in Mousterian tool kits.27 The tool assemblages in particular sites may be characterized as Mousterian, but one site may have more or fewer scrapers, points, and so forth than another site. A number of archaeologists have suggested possible reasons for this variation. For example, Sally Binford and Lewis Binford suggested that different activities may have occurred in different sites. Some sites may have been used for butchering and other sites may have been base camps; hence, the kinds of tools found in different sites should vary.28 And

Paul Fish has suggested that some sites may have more tools produced by the Levalloisian technique because larger pieces of flint were available.<sup>29</sup> The Middle Stone Age in Africa Like Mousterian tools, many Middle Stone Age tools were struck off prepared cores in the Levalloisian way. The assemblages consist mostly of various types of flake tools. A well-described sequence of such tools comes from the area around the mouth of the Klasies River on the southern coast of South Africa. This area contains rock shelters and small caves in which early and later *Homo sapiens* lived. The oldest cultural remains in one of the caves may date back 120,000 years.30 These earliest tools include parallel-sided flake blades (probably used as knives), pointed flakes (possibly spearpoints), burins or gravers (chisel-like tools), and scrapers. Similar tools discovered at

#### Homesites

Most of the excavated Middle Paleolithic homesites in Europe and the Near East are located in caves and rock shelters. The same is true for the excavated Middle Stone Age homesites in sub-Saharan Africa. We might conclude, therefore, that Neandertals (as well as many early modern humans) lived mostly in caves or rock shelters. But that conclusion

Border cave, South Africa, may have been used almost 200,000 years ago.31

![](_page_7_Figure_10.jpeg)

Flakes were carefully retouched, usually on two sides. Mousterian tools, associated with Neandertals, are part of what archaeologists call the Middle Paleolithic, about 200,000 to 35,000 years before the present.

Compared with an Acheulian assemblage, the Middle Paleolithic (40,000â€“300,000 years ago) Mousterian has a smaller proportion of large core tools such as hand axes and cleavers and a bigger proportion of small flake tools such as scrapers. Flakes were often altered or "retouched" by striking small flakes or chips from one or more edges.

## **Perspectives on Gender**

#### Liafola

#### Mother-Infant Communication and the Origin of Language

ost models for the origin of human language identify tool use and hunting as major factors driving the development of language skills in early humans. Problems with these models of language origin are well recognized. Flintknappers have suggested that observation and imitation are more important than vocal communication in learning to make stone tools. Most contemporary hunters communicate with hand signals rather than speech during hunts. But despite these problems, the view that tool use and hunting promoted language is still widely accepted. Feminist scholars have raised another objection: gender bias. They suggest that toolmaking and hunting are typically male roles, so that these models of language origin see males as the producers of human language. Several have suggested alternative models that give women a primary role in language origins.

Catherine Borchert and Adrienne Zihlman have argued that language

may have developed through mother-infant communication. They suggest that the problems faced by hominin mothers and infants may also have played a key role in the origin of language. The extreme dependency of human infants on their mothers may have been one important factor. Infants would have had to convey both distress and desire to their mothers. Anyone who has ever been around infants knows that they are able to let you know when they are content, when they are in distress, and when they want something, even though they cannot talk. Borchert and Zihlman argue that many uniquely human traits like crying, smiling, laughing, and cooing may have evolved as ways for mothers and infants to communicate, and such communication may well have provided the beginnings of human language.

Borchert and Zihlman also point out that child rearing in human groups is a social process with many caretakers, not just the mother, looking after children. Communication would have been essential in these interactions as well, both for the mother and the child. The mother would have needed to be able to convey known needs and preferences to caretakers of her child, and more significantly, the child would have had to be able to communicate with caretakers who were not the mother. Sharing child care would have required a shared communication system that all members of the group, both adults and infants, could understand. Borchert and Zihlman suggest it may have been these social interactions among mothers, infants, and caretakers that formed the foundation for human language, not toolmaking and hunting. If so, language may have begun to develop before toolmaking and hunting.

Levalloisian method A method that allowed flake tools of a predetermined size to be produced from a shaped core. The toolmakers first shaped the core and prepared a "striking platform" at one end. Flakes of predetermined and standard sizes could then be knocked off. Although some Levallois flakes date from as far back as 400,000 years ago, they are found more frequently in Mousterian tool kits.

could be incorrect. Caves and rock shelters may be overrepresented in the archaeological record because they are more likely to be found than are sites that originally were in the open but now are hidden by thousands of years, and many feet, of sediment. Sediment is the dust, debris, and decay that accumulate over time; when we dust the furniture and vacuum the floor, we are removing sediment.

Still, we know that many Neandertals lived at least part of the year in caves. This was true, for example, along the Dordogne River in France. The river gouged deep valleys in the limestone of that area. Below the cliffs are rock shelters with overhanging roofs and deep caves, many of which were occupied during the Middle Paleolithic. Even if the inhabitants did not stay all year, the sites do seem to have been occupied year after year.<sup>32</sup> Although there is evidence of some use of fire in earlier cultures, Middle Paleolithic humans seem to have relied more on fire. There are thick layers of ash in many rock shelters and caves and evidence that hearths were used to increase the efficiency of the fires.<sup>33</sup>

Quite a few Neandertal homesites were in the open. In Africa, open-air sites were located on floodplains, at the edges of lakes, and near springs.<sup>34</sup> Many open-air sites have been found in Europe, particularly eastern Europe. The occupants of the well-known site at Moldova in western Russia lived in river-valley houses framed with wood and covered with animal skins. Bones of mammoths, huge elephants now extinct, surround the remains of hearths and were apparently used to help hold the animal skins in place. Even though the winter climate near the edge of the glacier nearby was cold at that time, there still would have been animals to hunt because the plant food for the game was not buried under deep snow.

The hunters probably moved away in the summer to higher land between the river valleys. In all likelihood, the higher ground was grazing land for the large herds of animals the Moldova hunters depended on for meat. In the winter river valley sites, archaeologists have found skeletons of wolf, arctic fox, and hare with their paws missing. These animals probably were skinned for pelts that were made into clothing.35

#### Getting Food

How Neandertals got their food probably varied with their environment. In Africa, they lived in savanna and semiarid desert. In western and eastern Europe, they had to adapt to cold; during periods of increased glaciation, much of the environment was steppe grassland and tundra.

The European environment during this time was much richer in animal resources than the tundra of northern countries is today. Indeed, the European environment inhabited by Neandertals abounded in game, both big and small. The tundra and alpine animals included reindeer, bison, wild oxen, horses, mammoths, rhinoceroses, and deer, as well as bears, wolves, and foxes.36 Some European sites have also yielded bird and fish remains. For example, people in a summer camp in northern Germany apparently hunted swans and ducks and fished for perch and pike.37 Little, however, is known about the particular plant foods the European Neandertals may have consumed; the remains of plants are unlikely to survive thousands of years in a nonarid environment.

In Africa, too, early *Homo sapiens* varied in how they got food. For example, we know that the people living at the mouth of the Klasies River in South Africa ate shellfish as well as meat from small grazers such as antelopes and large grazers such as eland and buffalo.38 But archaeologists disagree about how the Klasies River people got their meat when they began to occupy the caves in the area.

Richard Klein thinks they hunted both large and small game. Klein speculates that because the remains of eland of all ages have been found in Cave 1 at the Klasies River site, the people there probably hunted the eland by driving them into corrals or other traps, where animals of all ages could be killed. Klein thinks that buffalo were hunted differently. Buffalo tend to charge attackers, which would make it difficult to drive them into traps. Klein believes that because bones from mostly very young and very old buffalo are found in the cave, the hunters were able to stalk and kill only the most vulnerable animals.39

Lewis Binford thinks the Klasies River people hunted only small grazers and scavenged the eland and buffalo meat from the kills of large carnivores. He argues that sites should contain all or almost all of the bones from animals that were hunted. According to Binford, because more or less complete skeletons are found only from small animals, the Klasies River people were not, at first, hunting all the animals they used for food.40

But evidence suggests that people were hunting big game as much as 400,000 years ago. Wooden spears that old were found in Germany in association with stone tools and the butchered remains of more than 10 wild horses. The heavy spears resemble modern aerodynamic javelins, which suggests they would have been thrown at large animals such as horses, not at small animals. This new evidence strongly suggests that hunting, not just scavenging, may be older than archaeologists once thought.41

#### Funeral and Other Rituals?

Some Neandertals appear to have been deliberately buried. At Le Moustier, the skeleton of a boy, 15 or 16 years old, was found with a beautifully fashioned stone axe near his hand. At La Ferrassie, five children and two adults were apparently interred together in a family plot. These finds, along with several at Shanidar cave in Iraq, have aroused speculation about the possibility of funeral rituals.

The most important evidence at Shanidar consists of pollen around and on top of a man's body. Pollen analysis suggests that the flowers included ancestral forms of modern grape hyacinths, bachelor's buttons, hollyhocks, and yellow flowering groundsels. John Pfeiffer speculated about this find:

*A man with a badly crushed skull was buried deep in the cave with special ceremony. One spring day about 60,000 years ago members of his family went out into the hills, picked masses of wild flowers, and made a bed of them on the ground, a resting place for the deceased. Other flowers were probably laid on top of his grave; still others seem to have been woven together with the branches of a pinelike shrub to form a wreath.*<sup>42</sup>

Can we be sure? Not really. All we really know is that there was pollen near and on top of the body. It could have gotten there because humans put flowers in the grave, or it could have gotten there for other, even accidental, reasons. Some scholars have argued that other Shanidar burials are actually the remains of people who were trapped under rockfalls within the cave and killedâ€”they were not deliberately buried at all but rather buried accidentally.43

Neandertals may have taken part in other rituals as well, but, like funeral rituals, the evidence is ambiguous. At Drachenloch cave in the Swiss Alps, for example, a stone-lined pit holding the stacked skulls of seven cave bears was found in association with a Neandertal habitation. Why preserve these skulls? One reason might be for rituals intended to placate or control bears. Cave bears were enormousâ€”some nearly nine feet tallâ€”and competed with Neandertals for prime cave living sites. Perhaps the Neandertals preserved the skulls of bears they killed in the cave as a way of honoring or appeasing either the bears or their spirits. But, as with funeral rituals, the evidence is not completely persuasive. In our own society, some may hang a deer or moose head on the wall without any associated ritual. At this point, we cannot say for certain whether or not Neandertals engaged in ritual behavior.<sup>44</sup>

# The Denisovans

While there remain many unanswered questions about the Neandertals and their culture, a recent find in Siberia has created a new mystery, in this case involving a potentially new species of hominin living contemporaneously with the Neandertals and modern humansâ€”the **Denisovans**. Surprisingly, this new hominin species is known from only one site, Denisova Cave in the Altai region of southern Siberia, and through only a single molar and several fragmentary bones. How can a new species be defined through such a tiny amount of evidence? The answer is that the Denisovan finds were subjected to a new DNA recovery process, and the results were spectacular. We now have the most complete genetic picture of any ancient human, and it is different from either ancient modern humans or Neandertals.45

Who were the Denisovans? It's a difficult question to answer with so little information, but we do know several things. The Denisovans were neither Neandertals nor modern humans but a separate species that was more closely related to Neandertals than to modern humans. They appear to have separated from our lineage a little earlier than the Neandertals and from the Neandertals a bit later.46 If artifacts associated with the Denisovan remains were made by the Denisovans (both Neandertals and modern humans lived in the cave after Denisovans), then they fashioned Middle Paleolithic-style tools, but the stratigraphy of the cave makes this conclusion uncertain. Far less uncertain is the contribution of Denisovans to the modern human genomeâ€”people in Melanesia can count 4 percent to 6 percent of their DNA as coming from the Denisovans.47

# The Emergence of Modern Humans

**Cro-Magnon** humans, who appear in western Europe about 35,000 years ago, were once thought to be the earliest specimens of modern humans. (The Cro-Magnons are named after the rock shelter in France where they were first found, in 1868.48) But we now know that modern-looking humans appeared earlier outside of Europe. As of now, the oldest unambiguous fossils classified as *H. sapiens* come from Ethiopia and date to perhaps 160,000 years ago.49 Additional fossils, discovered in one of the Klasies River mouth caves in South Africa, are possibly as old as 100,000 years.50 Other *Homo sapiens* fossils of about the same age have been found in Border cave in South Africa.51 Remains of anatomically modern humans found at two sites in Israel, at Skhul and Qafzeh, which used to be thought to date back 40,000 years to 50,000 years, may be 90,000 years old.52 There are also anatomically modern human finds in Borneo, at Niah, from about 40,000 years ago and in Australia, at Lake Mungo, from about 30,000 years ago.<sup>53</sup>

These modern-looking humans differed from the Neandertals and other early *H. sapiens* in that they had higher, more bulging foreheads, thinner and lighter bones, smaller faces and jaws, chins (the bony protuberances that remain after projecting faces recede), and only slight browridges (or no ridges at all; see Figure 8.2).

#### Theories About the Origins of Modern Humans

Three theories about the origins of modern humans continue to be debated among anthropologists. One, which can be called the *single-origin theory* (sometimes called the total replacement theory), suggests that modern humans emerged in just one part of the Old World and then spread to other parts, replacing Neandertals, Denisovans, and perhaps other hominin species. (Africa is generally thought to be the place of modern humans' origin.) The second theory, which has been called the *multiregional theory*, developed in opposition to the single-origin theory and suggested that modern humans evolved in various parts of the Old World after *Homo erectus* spread out of Africa.54 The multiregional theory has largely been supplanted with the *assimilation theory*, which suggests that modern humans replaced Neandertals and Denisovans but that interbreeding during the replacement process led to some assimilation between the various hominins.55 Let's take a look at each of these theories.

Single-Origin Theory According to the single-origin theory, the Neandertals and Denisovans did not evolve into modern humans. Rather, Neandertals became extinct after 30,000 years ago because they were replaced by modern humans (we do not know yet when Denisovans became extinct). The presumed place of origin of the first modern humans has varied over the years as new fossils have been discovered. When earlier *Homo sapiens* were found in Africa, paleoanthropologists postulated that modern humans emerged first in Africa and then moved to the Near East and from there to Europe and Asia. Single-origin theorists think that the originally small population of *H. sapiens* had some biological or cultural advantage, or both, that allowed them to spread and replace Neandertals, Denisovans, and other hominins.

The main evidence for the single-origin theory comes from the genes of living peoples. In 1987, Rebecca Cann and her colleagues presented evidence that the mtDNA from people in the United States, New Guinea, Africa, and East Asia showed differences consistent with a common ancestor living only 200,000 years ago. Cann and colleagues further claimed that because the amount of variation among individuals was greatest in African populations, the common ancestor of all lived in Africa.56 (It is generally the case that people living in a homeland exhibit more variation than any emigrant descendant population.) Thus was born what the media called the "mitochondrial Eve" and the "Eve hypothesis" for the origins of modern humans. Of course, there wasn't just one "Eve"; there must have been more than one of her generation with similar mtDNA.

There were many problems with early mtDNA studies, but those problems have been addressed over the years, and new and better mtDNA analyses have been performed. Most scholars now agree that the mtDNA of modern humans shows a remarkably small degree of variation (in fact, less than half the variation found in most chimpanzee populations), which strongly suggests that we all share a very recent, common ancestry.57 More detailed analyses of mtDNA diversity in modern humans have allowed scholars to identify the ancestral roots of contemporary populations around the world, and these analyses also point to modern human origins in East Africa and a subsequent spread out of that region (see Figure 8.6).58

Evidence for an East African origin of modern humans and the subsequent expansion also comes from research on variation in the Y chromosome. The Y chromosome is the chromosome that determines whether a person is male. A female inherits an X chromosome from both her mother and father, whereas a male inherits an

This map shows the current location and suspected origin of mitochondrial DNA haplogroups in modern human populations. A haplogroup reflects a population that shares a unique mutation in their mtDNA. Such mutations, their age as determined by the molecular clock, and their relationship to other haplogroups that suggest a shared ancestral homeland, provide strong evidence for an African origin of modern humans.

X chromosome from his mother and a Y chromosome from his father. Only men have a Y chromosome, and because there is only one copy in any given man, the Y chromosome is the only nuclear chromosome that, like mtDNA, does not undergo recombination. Although the Y chromosome can be affected by selection, it is thought that most variation in the Y chromosome, like variation in mtDNA, is caused by random mutations. Variation in the Y chromosome can therefore be analyzed in much the same way as variation in mtDNA.<sup>59</sup>

The results of research on variation in the Y chromosome mirror those on variation in mtDNA to a remarkable extent. Analysis of Y chromosome variation points to Africa as the source of modern humans and suggests an exodus from Africa of modern humans. One of the major differences between mtDNA studies and those employing the Y chromosome is in the dating of the most recent common ancestor. As noted previously, studies of mtDNA suggest the most recent common ancestor lived about 200,000 years ago, whereas studies of the Y chromosome suggest the most recent ancestor lived only about 100,000 years ago.60 Additional research, including new research on variation in nuclear DNA, may help to resolve these differences. For now, however, it seems clear that the modern human gene pool has a single, and fairly recent, origin in Africa.<sup>61</sup>

The mtDNA and nuclear DNA analyses of Neandertals, and the archaeological evidence suggesting that Neandertals and modern humans lived without apparent interaction in Europe and the Near East, also tend to support the single-origin theory. The *Homo sapiens* skeletal material from Ethiopia, Africa, in the 150,000â€“200,000-years-ago time range, further supports the single-origin theory.62 However, such evidence does not necessarily contradict the validity of the multiregional theory of human origins.

Multiregional Theory According to the multiregional theory, *Homo erectus* populations in various parts of the Old World gradually evolved into anatomically modernlooking humans. The few scholars who continue to support this view believe that the "transitional" or "archaic"*H. sapiens* and the Neandertals represent phases in the gradual development of more "modern" anatomical features. Indeed, as we have noted, some of these scholars see so much continuity between *Homo erectus* and modern humans that they classify *Homo erectus* as *Homo sapiens erectus.*

Continuity is the main evidence multiregional theorists use to support their position. In several parts of the world, there seem to be clear continuities in distinct skeletal features between *Homo erectus* and *Homo sapiens.* For example, *Homo erectus* fossils from China tend to have broader faces with more horizontal cheekbones than specimens from elsewhere in the world, traits that also appear in modern Chinese populations.63 Southeast Asia provides more compelling evidence, according to multiregional theorists. There, a number of traitsâ€”relatively thick cranial bones, a receding forehead, an unbroken browridge, facial prognathism, relatively large cheekbones, and relatively large molarsâ€”appear to persist from *Homo erectus* through modern populations.64 But others suggest that these traits cannot be used to establish a unique continuation from *Homo erectus* in Southeast Asia because these traits are found in modern humans all over the world. And still others argue that the traits are not as similar as the multiregional theorists claim.<sup>65</sup>

Assimilation Theory The assimilation theory, which is perhaps the most widely supported of the three theories of modern human origins today, suggests that while there may have been replacement of one population by another, interbreeding between early modern humans who spread out of Africa and populations encountered in North Africa, Europe, and Asia also contributed to the emergence of modern humans.66

Genetic data provide the strongest support for the assimilation theory. Not only does it appear that modern human nuclear DNA contains from 1 percent to 6 percent of Neandertal and Denisovan nuclear DNA, but some of that DNA provided important benefits to modern humans. For example, it appears that an important part of the modern human immune system, human leukocyte antigens (HLA), were inherited from Neandertals and Denisovans.67 Presumably, these antigens provided unique benefits to modern humans and so were transmitted throughout the human population despite their introduction through what appears to be a very low level of interbreeding.

## What Happened to the Neandertals?

Regardless of which theory (single-origin, multiregional, or assimilation) is correct, it seems clear that Neandertals and modern humans coexisted in Europe and the Near East for at least 20,000 years and maybe as long as 60,000 years. What happened to the Neandertals? Three answers have generally been considered. The multiregional theorists assume considerable interbreeding and gradual change, so the disappearance of Neandertal traits would not be surprising. The single-origin theorists assume that replacement occurredâ€”either because they were killed off by modern humans or they were driven to extinction due to competition with modern humans. Let's take a look at each of these scenarios.

#### Interbreeding

The interbreeding scenario seems the most probable, yet genetic evidence supporting it is ambiguous. If the interbreeding hypothesis were correct, then we would expect to find Neandertal traits in modern humans. According to the nuclear DNA evidence, we do find a small percentage of Neandertal traits. But the mtDNA and Y chromosome analyses we have discussed several times suggest a divergence between Neandertals and modern humans 100,000 to 200,000 years ago with no interbreeding.

Recent research on Neandertal tools suggests that some Neandertal groups adopted new techniques of tool manufacture that are thought to be uniquely associated with modern humans and that they produced jewelry.68 If Neandertals were learning from modern humans, then the idea that they could have interbred and perhaps been absorbed within the modern human population gains credibility.

#### Genocide

The genocide scenario, that modern humans killed off Neandertals, has appeal as a sensational story but little evidence. Not a single "murdered" Neandertal has ever been found, and one might wonder, in a fight between the powerful Neandertals and the more gracile modern humans, who might get the better of whom.

8.5 Evaluate competing scenarios for the disappearance of Neandertals.

#### Extinction

Finally, the extinction scenario, that Neandertals simply could not compete with modern humans, seems to have the best archaeological support. As we discussed earlier, there appear to be "refugee" populations of Neandertals in Iberia as recently as perhaps 30,000 years ago. The "retreat" of Neandertals from the Near East, eastern Europe, and finally western Europe following the movement of modern humans into the region seems to support the "refugee" interpretation.69 More importantly, physical anthropologist Erik Trinkaus has argued, based on both physical characteristics of the Neandertal skeleton and their apparent patterns of behavior, that Neandertals were less efficient hunters and gatherers than modern humans.70 And not only may Neandertals have been less efficient than modern humans in getting food, they may have needed more of it. Steve Churchill has suggested that Neandertals' stocky bodies and great muscle mass might have required 25 percent more calories than modern humans.71 If this is true, a modern human group would have been able to live and reproduce more easily than a Neandertal group in the same territory, and this would likely drive the Neandertals away. When there were no new territories to run to, the Neandertals would go extinctâ€”precisely what the archaeological record seems to suggest.<sup>72</sup>

Of course, it is possible that there was some interbreeding with modern humans prior to the extinction of the Neandertals, which would be consistent with assimilationist theory.

# Summary and Review

### The Transition from *Homo erectus* to *Homo sapiens*

8.1 Discuss the anatomical characteristics of the Neandertals and the relationship between Neandertals and *Homo sapiens*.

- â€¢ Most anthropologists agree that *Homo erectus* began to evolve into *Homo sapiens* after about 500,000 years ago but do not agree about how and when the transition occurred
- â€¢ The mixed traits of the transitional fossils include large cranial capacities (well within the range of modern humans), together with low foreheads and large browridges, which are characteristic of *H. erectus* specimens.
- â€¢ Some scholars have suggested that the "transitional" fossils share common traits and may actually represent a separate speciesâ€”*Homo heidelbergensis*.
- â€¢ The Neandertals, genetically distinct from modern humans, evolved in Europe by about 200,000 years ago. They were robust, with large brains and faces, and had a complex culture that used sophisticated stone tools and practiced possibly complex ritual behavior.

â€¢ The earliest definite *H. sapiens* appeared about 160,000 years ago.

What is the likely the relationship between Neandertals and modern humans?

### Middle Paleolithic Cultures

8.2 Describe the features of Middle Paleolithic cultures.

- â€¢ The period of cultural history associated with the Neandertals is traditionally called the Middle Paleolithic in Europe and the Near East and dates from about 300,000 years to about 40,000 years ago.
- â€¢ Assemblages of flake tools from this period are referred to as Mousterian (Europe, Near East) and as Middle Stone Age (Africa). Both assemblages proportionally have fewer large hand axes and cleavers and more small flake tools than an Acheulian assemblage.
- â€¢ Middle Paleolithic humans lived at least part of the year in caves and seem to have relied more on fire than earlier species. Some Mousterian sites show signs of intentional burial.

What features are common among Middle Paleolithic cultures?

### The Denisovans

8.3 Explain the relationship of Denisovans to Neandertals and modern humans.

- â€¢ The Denisovans are known from a handful of skeletal fragments found at a single site in southern Siberia.
- â€¢ DNA recovered from those fragments revealed that they belonged to a unique species of hominin that had interbred with modern humans and contributed some of its DNA to us.

### The Emergence of Modern Humans

8.4 Explain theories about the origins of modern humans and how they differed from earlier species.

â€¢ Modern-looking humans differed from the Neandertals and other early *H. sapiens* in that they had higher, more bulging foreheads, thinner and lighter bones, smaller faces and jaws, chins, and only slight browridges (or no ridges at all).

â€¢ Anthropologists continue to debate three theories about the origins of modern humans: the singleorigin theory, the multiregional theory, and the assimilation theory.

Which of the three theories about the origins of modern humans is most widely supported and why?

### What Happened to the Neandertals?

8.5 Evaluate competing scenarios for the disappearance of Neandertals.

- â€¢ The area inhabited by Neandertals shrunk after about 60,000 years ago, and by about 30,000 years ago, Neandertals had disappeared.
- â€¢ Neandertals probably became extinct because they could not compete with modern humans, who were more efficient hunters and gatherers.

# Think on it

- 1. If the single-origin or "out-of-Africa" theory were correct, by what mechanisms could *Homo sapiens* have been able to replace *Homo erectus* and *Homo neandertalensis* populations?
- 2. If modern human traits emerged in *Homo erectus* populations in different areas more or less at the same time, what mechanisms would account for similar traits emerging in different regions?
- 3. How do Middle Paleolithic cultures differ from Lower Paleolithic cultures?
