fter about 40,000 years ago, we see many significant changes in the archaeological record, reflecting important changes in cultural and social life. We see art, many new inventions, and considerable increases in population. This period of cultural history in Europe, the Near East, and Asia is known as the Upper Paleolithic (see Figure 9.1) and dates from about 40,000 years ago to the period known as the Neolithic (beginning about 10,000 years ago, depending on the area). In Africa, the cultural period comparable to the Upper Paleolithic is known as the Later Stone Age and may have begun much earlier. In North and South America, the period begins when humans first entered the New World. some time before 12,000 years ago (these colonizers are typically called Paleo-Indians) and continues until what are called Archaic traditions emerged some 10,000 years ago. To

simplify terminology, we use the term Upper Paleolithic to refer to cultural developments in all areas of the Old World during this period.

In many respects, lifestyles during the Upper Paleolithic were similar to lifestyles before. People were still mainly hunters, gatherers, and fishers who probably lived in small mobile bands. They made their camps out in the open in skin-covered huts and in caves and rock shelters. And they continued to produce smaller and smaller stone tools.

But the Upper Paleolithic is also characterized by a variety of new developments. One of the most striking developments is the emergence of art—painting on cave walls and stone slabs, and carving tools, decorative objects, and personal ornaments out of bone, antler, shell, and stone. (Perhaps for this, as well as other purposes, people began to obtain materials from distant sources.) Because more archaeological sites date from the Upper Paleolithic than from any previous period and some Upper Paleolithic sites seem larger than any before, many archaeologists think that the human population increased considerably during the Upper Paleolithic.<sup>1</sup> And new inventions, such as the bow and arrow, the spear thrower, and tiny replaceable blades that could be fitted into handles, appear for the first time.<sup>2</sup>

9.1 Describe the environment of the Upper Paleolithic world.

### The Last Ice Age

The Upper Paleolithic world had an environment very different from today's. The earth was gripped by the last ice age, with glaciers covering Europe as far south as Berlin and Warsaw, and North America as far south as Chicago. To the south of these glacial fronts was a tundra zone extending in Europe to the Alps and in North America to the Ozarks, Appalachians, and well out onto the Great Plains (see Figure 9.2). Environmentally, both Europe and North America probably resembled contemporary Siberia and northern Canada. Elsewhere in the world conditions were not as extreme but were still different from conditions today.<sup>3</sup>

For one thing, the climate was different. Annual temperatures were as much as 50°F (10°C) below today's, and changes in ocean currents would have made temperature contrasts (i.e., the differences between summer and winter months) more extreme as well. The changing ocean currents also changed weather patterns, and Europe experienced heavy annual snowfall. Not all the world was cold, however; still, the presence of huge ice sheets in the north changed the climate throughout the world. North Africa, for example, appears to have been much wetter than today, and South Asia was apparently drier. And everywhere the climate seems to have been highly variable.4

The plants and animals of the Upper Paleolithic world were adapted to these extreme conditions. Among the most important, and dramatic, were the large game animals collectively known as *Pleistocene megafauna.*<sup>5</sup> These animals, as their name suggests,

were huge compared to their contemporary descendants. In North America, for example, giant ground sloths stood some 8 feet to 10 feet tall and weighed several thousand pounds. Siberian mammoths were the largest elephants ever to live—some standing more than 14 feet tall. In East Asia, species such as the woolly rhinoceros and giant deer were present.

### Upper Paleolithic Europe

With the vast supplies of meat available from megafauna, it is not surprising that many Upper Paleolithic cultures relied on hunting, and this was particularly true of the Upper Paleolithic peoples of Europe, on whom we focus here. Their way of life represents

a common pattern throughout the Old World. But as people began to use more diverse resources in their environments, the use of local resources allowed Upper Paleolithic groups in much of the Old World to become more sedentary than their predecessors. They also began to trade with neighboring groups to obtain resources not available in their local territories.6

As was the case in the known Middle Paleolithic sites, most of the Upper Paleolithic remains that have been excavated were situated in caves and rock shelters. In southwestern France, some groups seem to have paved parts of the shelter floors with stones. Tentlike structures were built in some caves, apparently to keep out the cold.7 Some open-air sites have also been excavated.

The site at Dolni Vestonice in what is now the Czech Republic, dated to around 25,000 years ago, is one of the first for which there is an entire settlement plan.8 The settlement seems to have consisted of four tentlike huts, probably made from animal skins, with a great open hearth in the center. Around the outside were mammoth bones, some rammed into the ground, which suggests that the huts were surrounded by a wall. All told, there were bone heaps from about 100 mammoths. Each hut probably housed a group of related families—about 20 to 25 people. (One hut was approximately 27 feet by 45 feet and had five hearths distributed inside it, presumably one for each family.) With 20 to 25 people per hut, and assuming that all four huts were occupied at the same time, the population of the settlement would have been 100 to 125 people.

Up a hill from the settlement was a fifth and different kind of hut. It was dug into the ground and contained a bake oven and more than 2,300 small, fired fragments of animal figurines. There were also some hollow bones that may have been musical instruments. Another interesting feature of the settlement was a burial

find, of a woman with a disfigured face. She may have been a particularly important personage; her face was found engraved on an ivory plaque near the central hearth of the settlement.

#### Upper Paleolithic Tools

Upper Paleolithic toolmaking appears to have had its roots in the Mousterian and post-Acheulian traditions because flake tools are found in many Upper Paleolithic sites. But the Upper Paleolithic is characterized by a preponderance of blades; there were also burins, bone and antler tools, and microliths. In addition, two new techniques of toolmaking appeared—*indirect percussion* and *pressure flaking.* Blades were found in Middle Paleolithic assemblages, but they were not widely used until the Upper Paleolithic. Although blades can be made in a variety of ways, **indirect percussion** using a hammer-struck punch was common in the Upper Paleolithic. After shaping a core into a pyramidal or cylindrical form, toolmakers put a punch of antler, wood, or other hard material into position and struck it with a hammer. Because the force is readily directed, toolmakers were able to strike off consistently shaped **blades**, which are more than twice as long as they are wide9 (see Figure 9.3).

The Upper Paleolithic is also noted for the production of large numbers of bone, antler, and ivory tools; needles, awls, and harpoons made of bone appear for the first time.10 The manufacture of these implements may have been made easier by the

development of many varieties of burins. **Burins** are chisel-like stone tools used for carving; bone and antler needles, awls, and projectile points could be produced with them.11 Burins have been found in Middle and Lower Paleolithic sites but are present in great number and variety only in the Upper Paleolithic.

**Pressure flaking** also appeared during the Upper Paleolithic. Rather than using percussion to strike off flakes as in previous technologies, pressure flaking works by employing pressure with a bone, wood, or antler tool at the edge of the tool to remove small flakes. Pressure flaking would usually be used in the final stages of retouching a tool.12

As time went on, all over the Old World, smaller and smaller blade tools were produced. The very tiny ones, called **microliths**, were often hafted or fitted into handles, one blade at a time or several blades together, to serve as spears, adzes, knives, and sickles. The hafting required inventing a way to trim the blade's back edge so that it would be blunt rather than sharp. In this way, the blades would not split the handles into which they might be inserted; the blunting would also prevent the users of an unhafted blade from cutting themselves.<sup>13</sup>

Some archaeologists think that the blade technique was adopted because it made for more economical use of flint. André Leroi-Gourhan of the Musée de l'Homme in Paris calculated that, with the old Acheulian technique, a 2-pound lump of flint yielded 16 inches of working edge and produced only two hand axes. If the more advanced Mousterian technique were used, a lump of equal size would yield 2 yards of working edge. The indirect percussion

method of the Upper Paleolithic would yield as much as 25 yards of working edge.14 With the same amount of material, a significantly greater number of tools could be produced. Getting the most out of a valuable resource may have been particularly important in areas lacking large flint deposits. Then again, if the population were increasing, that by itself would require more tools and more working edges to be produced.

Jacques Bordaz suggested that the evolution of toolmaking techniques, which continually increased the amount of usable edge that could be gotten out of a lump of flint, was significant because people could then spend more time in regions where flint was unavailable. Another reason for adopting the blade toolmaking technique may have been that it made for easy repair of tools. For example, the cutting edge of a tool might consist of a line of razorlike microliths set into a piece of wood. The tool would not be usable if just one of the cutting edge's microliths broke off or was chipped. But if the user carried a small prepared core of flint from which an identical-sized microlith could be struck off, the tool could be repaired easily by replacing the lost or broken microlith. A spear whose point was lost could be repaired similarly. Thus, the main purpose of the blade toolmaking technique may not have been to make more economical use of flint but rather to allow easy replacement of damaged blades.15

How Were the Tools Used? Ideally, the study of tools should reveal not only how the implements were made but also how they were used. One way of suggesting what a particular tool was used for in the past is to observe the manner in which similar tools are used by members of recent or contemporary societies, preferably societies with subsistence activities and environments similar to those of the ancient toolmakers. This method of

**Burin** A chisel-like stone tool used for carving and for making such artifacts as bone and antler needles, awls, and projectile points.

**Blade** A thin flake whose length is usually more than twice its width. In the blade technique of toolmaking, a core is prepared by shaping a piece of flint with hammerstones into a pyramidal or cylindrical form. Blades are then struck off until the core is used up.

**Pressure flaking** Toolmaking technique whereby small flakes are struck off by pressing against the core with a bone, antler, or wooden tool.

**Microlith** A small, razorlike blade fragment that was probably attached in a series to a wooden or bone handle to form a cutting edge.

study is called reasoning from **ethnographic analogy**. The problem with such reasoning, however, is obvious: We cannot be sure that the original use of a tool was the same as the present use. When selecting recent or contemporary cultures that may provide the most informative and accurate comparisons, we should try to choose those that derive from the ancient culture in which we are interested. If the cultures being compared are historically related—prehistoric and recent Pueblo cultures in the southwestern United States, for example—there is a greater likelihood that the two groups used a particular kind of tool in similar ways and for similar purposes.16

Another way of suggesting what a particular kind of tool was used for is to compare the visible and microscopic wear marks on the prehistoric tools with the wear marks on similar tools made and experimentally used by contemporary researchers. The idea behind this approach is that different uses leave different wear marks. A pioneer in this research was S. A. Semenov, who re-created prehistoric stone tools and used them in a variety of ways to find out which uses left which kinds of wear marks. For example, by cutting into meat with his re-created stone knives, he produced a polish on the edges that was like the polish found on blades from a prehistoric site in Siberia. This finding led Semenov to infer that the Siberian blades were probably also used to cut meat.17

The tools made by Upper Paleolithic peoples suggest that they were much more effective hunters and fishers than their predecessors.18 During the Upper Paleolithic, and probably for the first time, spears were shot from a spear thrower rather than thrown with the arm. We know this because bone and antler **atlatls** (the Aztec word for "spear thrower") have been found in some sites. A spear propelled off a grooved board could be sent through the air with increased force, causing it to travel farther and hit harder with less effort by the thrower. The bow and arrow was also used in various places during the Upper Paleolithic, and harpoons, used for fishing and perhaps for hunting reindeer, were invented at this time.

These new tools and weapons for more effective hunting and fishing do not rule out the possibility that Upper Paleolithic peoples were still scavenging animal remains. Olga Soffer suggests that Upper Paleolithic peoples may have located their settlements near places where many mammoths died naturally in order to make use of the bones for building. For example, in Moravia, the mammoths may have come to lick deposits of calcite and

Here we see the type of mammoth-bone shelters constructed about 15,000 years ago on the East European Plain. Often mammoth skulls formed part of the foundation for the tusk, long bone, and wooden frame, covered with hide. As many as 95 mammoth mandibles were arranged around the outside in a herringbone pattern.

other sources of magnesium and calcium, particularly during the late spring and early summer when resources were short and mortality was high. Consistent with the idea that humans may not have killed so many of the enormous mammoths is the fact that in some places there are few human-made cut marks on mammoth bones. For example, at Dolni Vestonice, where bones of 100 mammoths were found, few bones show cut marks from butchering and few bones were found inside the huts. In contrast, the site is littered with bison, horse, and reindeer bones, suggesting that these other animals were deliberately killed and eaten by humans. If the people had been able to kill all the mammoths we find the remains of, why would they have hunted so many other animals?19

#### Upper Paleolithic Art

The earliest discovered traces of art are beads and carvings, and then paintings, from Upper Paleolithic sites. We might expect that early artistic efforts were crude, but the cave paintings of Spain and southern France show a marked degree of skill. So do the naturalistic paintings on slabs of stone excavated in southern Africa. Some of those slabs appear to have

been painted as much as 28,000 years ago, which suggests that painting in Africa is as old as painting in Europe.20 But painting may be even older than that. The early Australians may have painted on the walls of rock shelters and cliff faces at least 30,000 years ago and maybe as much as 60,000 years ago.21 And at Blombos Cave in South Africa, engraved pieces of red ochre date back to more than 77,000 years ago.<sup>22</sup>

Peter Ucko and Andrée Rosenfeld identified three principal locations of paintings in the caves of western Europe: (1) in obviously inhabited rock shelters and cave entrances art as decoration or "art for art's sake"; (2) in "galleries" immediately off the inhabited areas of caves; and (3) in the inner reaches of caves, whose difficulty of access has been interpreted by some as a sign that magical-religious activities were performed there.23

The subjects of the paintings are mostly animals. The paintings are on bare walls, with no backdrops or environmental trappings. Perhaps, like many contemporary peoples, Upper Paleolithic men and women believed that the drawing of a human image could cause death or injury. If that were indeed their belief, it might explain why human figures are rarely depicted in cave art (but see the box feature on "Depictions of Women in Upper Paleolithic Art"). Another explanation for the focus on animals might be that these people sought to improve their luck at hunting. This theory is suggested by evidence of chips in the painted figures, perhaps made by spears thrown at the drawings. But if hunting magic was the chief motivation for the paintings, it is difficult to explain why only a few show signs of having been speared. Perhaps then the paintings were inspired by the need to increase the supply of animals. Cave art seems to have reached a peak toward the end of the Upper Paleolithic period, when the herds of game were decreasing.

The particular symbolic significance of the cave paintings in southwestern France is more explicitly revealed, perhaps, by the results of Patricia Rice and Ann Paterson's statistical study.24 The data suggest that the animals portrayed in the cave paintings were mostly the ones that the painters preferred for meat and for materials such as hides. For example, wild cattle (bovines) and horses are portrayed more often than we would expect by chance, probably because they were larger and heavier (meatier) than the other animals in the environment. In addition, the paintings mostly portray animals that the painters may have feared the most because of their size, speed, natural weapons such as tusks and horns, and unpredictability of behavior. That is, mammoths, bovines, and horses are portrayed more often than deer and reindeer. Thus, the paintings are consistent with the idea that "the art is related to the importance of hunting in the economy of Upper Paleolithic people."25

### Perspectives on Gender

#### Depictions of Women in Upper Paleolithic Art

I t is a common misperception that depictions of the human form in Upper Paleolithic art are restricted to Venus figurines. To the contrary, there are many other depictions of humans, both female and male, running the whole range of ages from infants to elderly people. For women, figures of obese or pregnant women, like those sometimes depicted in Venus figurines, appear to be only one type in a wide range of images, many of which offer accurate rather than stylized representations.

In a survey of Upper Paleolithic art, Jean-Pierre Duhard found that all shapes and sizes of women as well as all age ranges were present. Indeed, he argued that a range of female body types can be seen. One engraved figure from Gönnersdorf cave on the Rhine River, for example, depicts four women. Three are the same size, but one is smaller and has small breasts—she may be an adolescent. Of the three larger figures, one appears to have a child tied to her

back, and she also has large, rounded breasts, as opposed to the flat and pointed breasts of the other two. Duhard argued that this is an accurate depiction of four women, one with a child she is breast-feeding.

Duhard also argued that although depictions of women are common in Upper Paleolithic art, similar depictions of men and children are comparatively rare. He suggested this disparity may reflect women's status in Upper Paleolithic societies. Most depictions of women show them in some motherhood role—pregnant, in childbirth, or carrying an infant (and perhaps walking with older children). Duhard suggested that women's roles as mothers may have given them a privileged status in Upper Paleolithic life, which may be why that status is the most frequently depicted subject in Upper Paleolithic art.

In a similar way, Patricia Rice has argued that Venus figurines accurately reflect the social importance of women in Upper Paleolithic society.

She demonstrated that a range of body types and ages are represented in Venus figurines and argued that because the Venuses depict real women of all ages, not just pregnant women, they should be seen as symbols of "womanhood" rather than "motherhood." The wide distribution of Venus figurines and their apparent importance to Upper Paleolithic peoples reflect, according to Rice, the recognized importance of women in Upper Paleolithic society.

Arguing along similar lines, Olga Soffer examined the clothing worn by some Venus figures. Soffer and her colleagues show that woven items are the most frequently depicted and argue that because these woven items would have been highly valued in Upper Paleolithic society, their presence on some Venus figurines suggests that some women held positions of high status in Upper Paleolithic society.

*Sources*: Duhard 1993; Rice 1981; Soffer et al. 2000.

Consistent with this idea, according to the investigators, is the fact that the art of the cultural period that followed the Upper Paleolithic also seems to reflect how people got their food. But in that period, when getting food no longer depended on hunting large game (because they were becoming extinct), the art ceased to focus on portrayals of animals.

Upper Paleolithic art was not confined to cave paintings. Many spear shafts and similar objects were decorated with figures of animals. Alexander Marshack has an interesting interpretation of some of the engravings made during the Upper Paleolithic. He believes that, as far back as 30,000 years ago, hunters may have used a system of notation, engraved on bone and stone, to mark the phases of the moon. If this is true, it would mean that Upper Paleolithic people were capable of complex thought and were consciously aware of their environment.26 In addition, figurines representing the human female in exaggerated form have been found at Upper Paleolithic sites. Called Venuses, these figurines portray women with broad hips and large breasts and abdomens.

What the Venus figurines symbolized is still controversial. Most scholars believe these figurines represented a goddess or fertility symbol, but that belief is not universally held. For example, LeRoy McDermott has argued that Venus figurines are not symbolic representations at all but rather accurate self-portraits made by pregnant women. Their exaggerated breasts, hips, and stomachs are distortions that can be attributed to the perspective gained by a person looking down at herself, as is the lack of facial details on many of the figurines.27 Others have argued that the figurines are examples of early erotica made by males for their sexual gratification or education. Still others suggest they were made by females to instruct young women in pregnancy and childbirth.<sup>28</sup>

The controversies surrounding Venus figurines provide insight into a basic problem in archaeology: There is often little or no evidence available that allows us to accept or reject a particular interpretation. Rather, in most cases, we have to balance data and interpretation to come to an informed judgment, recognizing that our judgment will likely change with new data.

#### Language

When did hominins acquire language? It is a notoriously difficult question to answer archaeologically. Some scholars have argued that *Homo erectus* must have had language to develop the broadly shared Acheulean tool tradition. Others have suggested that the modern FOXP2 gene is directly associated with language, and because Neandertals and modern humans share the same gene, Neandertals must have had language. But none of this is direct evidence of language.

If we think of language as a system of shared symbols (whether vocal or written), then the emergence of symbolic art in the Upper Paleolithic may be taken as direct archaeological evidence of language. Indeed, paleoanthropologist Richard Klein sees the rapid emergence of art and ritual in the Upper Paleolithic as evidence of the emergence of the modern human brain. He believes that around 50,000 years ago some key mutation occurred that unlocked our big brain's potential for abstract and symbolic thought. As Klein explains:

*This mutation could have originated in a small east African population, and the evolutionary advantage it conferred would have enabled the population to grow and expand. This is because it permitted its possessors to extract far more energy from nature and to invest it in society. It also allowed human populations to colonize new and challenging environments. Possibly the most critical aspect of the neural change was that* 

The Venus of Lespugues, one of the most famous Venus figurines.

*it allowed the kind of rapidly spoken phonemic language that is inseparable from culture as we know it today.29*

For now, all we can say is that the symbolic aspects of culture blossomed during the Upper Paleolithic and set the stage for the complex cultural life we follow today. The emergence of language may well have been a key aspect of the Upper Paleolithic cultural fluorescence.

### Upper Paleolithic Cultures in Africa and Asia

Europe was not the only region where Upper Paleolithic peoples thrived. In North Africa, for example, Upper Paleolithic peoples hunted large animals on the grasslands that covered the region during that period. They lived in small communities located within easy access to water and other resources, and they moved regularly, probably to follow the animal herds. Trade took place between local groups, particularly for high-quality stone used in making tools.30 In eastern and southern Africa, a way of life known as the Later Stone Age developed that persisted in some areas until very recently. People lived in small, mobile groups, hunting large animals and collecting a wide variety of plant foods. Interaction was common among these bands. Among their ethnographically known descendants, individuals would regularly switch their membership from one band to another.<sup>31</sup>

9.3 Describe Upper Paleolithic migration from Africa to Asia.

In South Asia, the Upper Paleolithic saw an increasingly sedentary lifestyle developing along the banks of freshwater streams. The Upper Paleolithic peoples in South Asia combined hunting, fishing, and gathering with seasonal movements to exploit seasonally abundant resources.32 In East and Southeast Asia, ocean resources became vital to coastaldwelling peoples, whereas those inland lived primarily in caves, hunting and collecting broadly in the local environment. Many of these sites appear to have been occupied for long periods of time, suggesting some degree of sedentism. During the Upper Paleolithic, peoples from Asia also populated Australia, New Guinea, and some of the islands of western Melanesia, clearly demonstrating the ability of these peoples to navigate on the sea and to use its resources.33

9.4 Evaluate scenarios for the migration of humans into the New World.

### The Earliest Humans and Their Cultures in the New World

So far in this chapter, we have dealt only with the Old World—Africa, Europe, and Asia. What about the New World—North and South America? How long have humans lived there, and what were their earliest cultures like?

Because only *Homo sapiens* fossils have been found in North and South America, migrations of humans to the New World had to have taken place some time after the emergence of *H. sapiens.* But exactly when these migrations occurred is subject to debate, particularly about when people got to areas south of Alaska (see the box feature on "Who Were the First Americans?"). On the basis of similarities in biological traits such as tooth forms and blood types, and on possible linguistic relationships, anthropologists agree that Native Americans originally came from Asia. The traditional assumption is that they came to North America from Siberia, walking across a land bridge (Beringia) that is now under water (the Bering Strait) between Siberia and Alaska. The ice sheets or glaciers that periodically covered most of the high latitudes of the world contained so much of the world's water (the ice sheets were thousands of feet thick in some places) that Beringia was dry land in various periods (see Figure 9.4). For example, there was a land bridge for a while, until the last 10,000 years or so. Since then, the glaciers have mostly melted, and the Bering "bridge" has been completely covered by a higher sea level.

Until recently, the prevailing view was that humans were not present south of Alaska until after 11,500 years ago. Now it appears that modern humans were in North America as early as 15,000 years ago, and an extraordinary archaeological site called Monte Verde in Chile demonstrates that modern humans got to southern South America by at least 12,500 years ago.34 The Monte Verde site contains more than 700 stone tools, the remains of hide-covered huts, and a child's footprint next to a hearth.35 And there are other possible sites of early occupation.36 For example, the Cactus Hill site in Virginia, the Gault site in Texas, and the Shriver site in Missouri all contain a stratum of blades and other stone tools below a Paleo-Indian stratum containing Clovis tools. Meadowcroft Rockshelter in western Pennsylvania contains the most carefully reported pre-Clovis occupation in North America.37 In the bottom third of a stratum that seems to date from 19,600 years to 8,000 years ago, the Meadowcroft site shows clear signs of human occupation—a small fragment of human bone, a spearpoint, and chipped knives and scrapers. If the dating is accurate, the tools would be about 12,800 years old. Perhaps the most surprising physical evidence for early people in the Americas comes from the Paisley Caves in southern

### **Applied Anthropology**

#### Who Were the First Americans?

key element of laws protecting archaeological materials in the United States is that descendant groups are given the right to decide how human remains and sacred objects unearthed from archaeological sites should be treated. Many descendant groups have requested such items be repatriated to the group or reburied in a location where they will not be disturbed. But a major problem has arisen surrounding the first Americans and their relationship to contemporary peoples. The most widely accepted model for how humans entered the New World is by walking across Beringia, which joined Asia and North America at the end of the last ice age, when sea levels were lower than today. There is good evidence to support this model, both archaeological and geological. But there are also some problems. There are sites that appear to date before the time when glacial ice had retreated far enough to allow access to North America. There are also South American sites that appear to be older than the oldest North American ones, which seems contradictory to a model based on humans moving into the New World from north to south.

An alternative model for human entry into the New World, which solves some of the problems with the Beringia model, suggests that some people came to the New World from Asia by boat. These people would have moved along the sea edge of the glaciers, subsisting on fish and sea mammals. Once past the glaciers, they either would have moved farther down the coast, perhaps all the way to the tip of South America, or proceeded inland into North America. Small groups of people may have made such voyages on many occasions, and it may be that none

established communities that lasted more than a few generations.

Some scholars posit that the few very early archaeological sites may be the remnants of these early explorers. The small numbers would leave only a small archaeological record, so it is not surprising that more material has not been found. The fact that early occupations at a number of sites are separated from later occupations by soil showing no signs of human presence may also be evidence that these early explorers were present but died out. Additional support for the coastal migration model has recently come from archaeological explorations of ancient coastlines now lying deep beneath the Bering Sea. Archaeologists have found stone tools in locations that would have been coastal during the last ice age.

Skeletons of very early Americans also suggest there may have been early populations that died out, as many appear more similar to East Asians than

to contemporary Native Americans in their skeletal features. If the colonization of the Americas was not as simple as the Beringia model suggests, how are archaeologists to determine descendant groups? What if no descendants remain? Current historic preservation laws make the situation difficult, and a number of lawsuits have tested the question of whether or not the first Americans were directly ancestral to contemporary Native Americans. The most well known of these legal cases involved a 9,300-year-old skeleton found along the Columbia River near Kennewick, Washington. After a nearly decade-long legal battle, a federal court decided that the skeleton was not "Native American" under current laws. Other cases are pending, and Congress may step in to clarify the legal status of the first Americans.

It was geologically possible for humans to have walked into the New World at various times, and they could have traveled by boat, too, as coastal areas of Alaska were icefree by at least 16,000 years ago.<sup>40</sup> Parts of the Beringia land bridge were exposed from

about 60,000 years to 25,000 years ago. Not until between 20,000 years and 18,000 years ago was the land bridge at its maximum, and it was finally inundated about 10,000 years ago. An ice-free corridor between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets may have been present after 25,000 years ago, but that corridor is not likely to have supported big game, and permitted humans to hunt enough for sustenance, until after about 14,000 years ago.41 Thus, it is likely that humans didn't arrive in the New World over land until after 14,000 years ago, but they could have arrived by a coastal route in boats much earlier, and certainly after 16,000 years ago.<sup>42</sup>

There were several different routes that modern humans could have used to enter the Americas over at least a time span of several thousand years. But how many groups did come to the Americas? According to comparative linguists Joseph Greenberg and Merritt Ruhlen, there were three waves of migration into the New World.43 They compared hundreds of languages in North and South America, grouping them into three different language families. Because each of these language families has a closer relationship to an Asian language family than to the other New World language families, it would appear that three different migrations came out of Asia. The first arrivals spoke a language that diverged over time into most of the languages found in the New World, the Amerind family of languages; the speakers of these related languages came to occupy all of South and Central America as well as most of North America. Next came the ancestors of the people who speak languages belonging to the Na-Dené family, which today includes Navajo and Apache in the southwestern United States and the various Athapaskan languages of northern California, coastal Oregon, northwestern Canada, and Alaska. Finally, perhaps 4,000 years ago, came the ancestors of the Inuit (Eskimo) and Aleut (the latter came to occupy the islands southwest of Alaska and the adjacent mainland), who speak languages belonging to the Inuit-Aleut family. Genetic analyses generally support the three-wave migration model but also suggest that the peopling of the New World may have been even more complicated.44 There could have been four separate migrations from the Old World, from different regions of Asia, or there could have been only one, with languages and genes diverging after humans arrived.45

#### The Paleo-Indians

Archaeological remains of early New World hunters, called *Paleo-Indians*, have been found in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Just south of the farthest reaches of the last glaciation, the area east of the Rockies known as the High Plains abounded with mammoths, bison, wild camels, and wild horses. The tools found with mammoth kills are known as the *Clovis complex*, which includes the Clovis projectile point as well as stone scrapers and knives and bone tools. The Clovis projectile point is large and leafshaped, flaked on both sides. It has a broad groove in the middle, presumably so that the point could be attached to a wooden spear shaft.46 Because one mammoth was found with eight Clovis points in it, there is little dispute that Clovis people hunted large game.47 Recent dating places most Clovis sites between 11,200 years and 10,900 years ago.48

The mammoth disappeared about 10,000 years ago, and the largest game animal became the now-extinct large, straight-horned bison. The hunters of that bison used a projectile point called the *Folsom point*, which was much smaller than the Clovis point. Tools are also

found with many other kinds of animal remains, including wolf, turtle, rabbit, horse, fox, deer, and camel, so the bison hunters obviously depended on other animals as well.49 In the Rio Grande valley, the Folsom toolmakers characteristically established a base camp on low dune ridges overlooking both a large pond and broad, open grazing areas. If we assume that the pond provided water for the grazing herds, the people in the camp would have been in an excellent position to watch the herds.<sup>50</sup>

As the climate of what is now the American Southwest became drier, the animals and the cultural adaptations changed somewhat. About 9,000 years ago, the smaller modern bison replaced the earlier straight-horned variety.51 Base camps began to be located farther from ponds and grazing areas and closer to streams. If the ponds were no longer reliable sources of water during these drier times, the animals probably no longer frequented them, which would explain why the hunters had to change the sites of their base camps. Not much is known about the plant foods these Paleo-Indian people may have exploited, but plant gathering on the desert fringes may have been vital. In Nevada and Utah, archaeologists have found milling stones and other artifacts for processing plant food.<sup>52</sup>

The Olsen-Chubbuck site, a kill site excavated in Colorado, shows the organization that may have been involved in hunting bison.53 In a dry gulch dated to 6500 b.c. were the remains of 200 bison. At the bottom were complete skeletons, and at the top were completely butchered animals. This find clearly suggests that Paleo-Indian hunters deliberately stampeded the animals into a natural trap—an arroyo, or steep-sided dry gully. The animals in front were probably pushed into the arroyo by the ones behind. Joe Ben Wheat estimated that the hunters may have obtained 55,000 pounds of meat from this one kill. If we judge from 19th-century Plains Indians, who could prepare bison meat to last a month, and estimate that each person would eat a pound a day, the kill at the Olsen-Chubbuck site could have fed more than 1,800 people for a month (they probably did not all live together throughout the year). The hunters must have been highly organized not only for the stampede itself but also for butchering. It seems that the enormous carcasses had to be carried to flat ground for that job. In addition, the 55,000 pounds of meat and hides had to be carried back to camp.<sup>54</sup>

Although big game may have been most important on the High Plains, other areas show different adaptations. For example, Paleo-Indian people in woodland regions of

what is now the United States seem to have depended more heavily on plant food and smaller game. In some woodland areas, fish and shellfish may have been a vital part of the diet.55 On the Pacific coast, some Paleo-Indian people developed food-getting strategies more dependent on fish.56 And in other areas, the lower Illinois River valley being one example, Paleo-Indian people who depended on game and wild vegetable foods managed to get enough food to live in permanent villages of perhaps between 100 and 150 people.<sup>57</sup>

Once humans colonized the Americas, they established a way of life very similar to that of their Upper Paleolithic cousins in the Old World, a life generally based on big game hunting. As time went on, life became more sedentary, with increasing interaction among local groups.

### The End of the Upper Paleolithic

After about 10,000 years ago, the glaciers began to disappear, and with their disappearance came other environmental changes. The melting of the glacial ice caused the oceans to rise, and, as the seas moved inland, the waters inundated some of the richest fodderproducing coastal plains, creating islands, inlets, and bays. Other areas were opened up for human occupation as the glaciers retreated and the temperatures rose.58 The cold, treeless plains, tundras, and grasslands eventually gave way to dense mixed forests, mostly birch, oak, and pine, and the Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. The warming waterways began to be filled with fish and other aquatic resources.59

Archaeologists believe that these environmental changes induced some populations to alter their food-getting strategies. When the tundras and grasslands disappeared, hunters could no longer obtain large quantities of meat simply by remaining close to large migratory herds of animals, as they probably did during Upper Paleolithic times. Even though deer and other game were available, the number of animals per square mile (density) had decreased, and it became difficult to stalk and kill animals sheltered in the thick woods. Thus, in many areas, people seemed to have turned from a reliance on big game hunting to the intensive collecting of wild plants, mollusks, fish, and small game to make up for the extinction of the large game animals they had once relied upon.

#### The Maglemosian Culture of Northern Europe

Some adaptations to the changing environment can be seen in the cultural remains of the settlers in northern Europe who archaeologists call *Maglemosians.* Their name derives from the peat bogs (*magle mose* in Danish means "great bog") where their remains have been found.

To deal with the new, more forested environment, the Maglemosians made stone axes and adzes to chop down trees and form them into various objects. Large timbers appear to have been split for houses; trees were hollowed out for canoes; and smaller pieces of wood were made into paddles. The canoes presumably were built for travel and perhaps for fishing on the lakes and rivers that abounded in the postglacial environment.

We do not know to what extent the Maglemosians relied on wild plant foods, but there were a lot of different kinds available, such as hazelnuts. However, we do know many other things about the Maglemosians' way of life. Although fishing was fairly important, as suggested by the frequent occurrence of bones from pike and other fish, as well as fishhooks, these people apparently depended mainly on hunting for food. Game included elk, wild ox, deer, and wild pig. In addition to many fishing implements and the adzes and axes, the Maglemosians' tool kit included the bow and arrow. Some of their tools were ornamented with finely engraved designs. Ornamentation independent of tools also appears in amber and stone pendants and small figurines representing, for example, the head of an elk.<sup>60</sup>

9.5 Relate the end of the Upper Paleolithic to climate change and the development of Maglemosian culture.

Like the Maglemosian finds, many of the European post–Upper Paleolithic sites are along lakes, rivers, and oceanfronts. But these sites probably were not inhabited yearround; there is evidence that at least some groups moved seasonally from one place of settlement to another, perhaps between the coast and inland areas.61 Finds such as kitchen *middens* (piles of shells) that centuries of post–Upper Paleolithic seafood eaters had discarded, and the remains of fishing equipment, canoes, and boats indicate that these people depended much more heavily on fishing than had their ancestors in Upper Paleolithic times.

#### The Archaic Cultures of Eastern North America

A related set of adaptations to the changing environment can be seen among the peoples who inhabited eastern North America at the end of the ice age. As the climate became warmer and drier, the flora and fauna of North America changed. Megafauna, as elsewhere in the world, went extinct and were replaced by smaller mammals, particularly deer. The availability of meat was greatly reduced—hunters could count on coming home with pounds, not tons, of meat. Warmer-adapted plants replaced cold-adapted plants and were used for food to replace the meat that was no longer available. Warmer-adapted plants had advantages as food resources for humans over cold-adapted ones because edible seeds, fruits, and nuts were more common, and often more plentiful and accessible, on the warmer-adapted plants. Thus, the Archaic peoples came to use a much greater diversity of plants and animals.62

The Archaic peoples of North America, like the Maglemosian peoples in Europe, began to follow a more sedentary lifestyle. Two forms of Archaic settlement appear to have been typical. One was a residential base camp, which would have been inhabited seasonally by several, probably related, families. The other was a special-purpose camp, which would have been a short-term habitation near a particular resource or perhaps used by a

group of hunters for a short period of time.63 On the Atlantic coast, for example, individual groups apparently moved seasonally along major river valleys, establishing summer base camps in the piedmont and winter camps near the coast. Special-purpose camps were created year-round as groups went out from the base camp to hunt and collect particular resources, such as stone for making tools.<sup>64</sup>

One of the innovations of the Archaic peoples was the development of ground stone woodworking tools. Axes, adzes, and tools for grinding seeds and nuts become more and more common in the tool kit.65 This probably reflects the emergence of greater areas of forest following the retreat of the glaciers from North America, but it also demonstrates a greater reliance on forest products and, most likely, a greater use of wood and wood products. Fish and shellfish also came to be relied upon in some areas, and this too reflects the adjustment made by the Archaic peoples to the changing conditions they faced at the end of the last ice age.

The innovation of most lasting importance in both the New and Old Worlds, however, was the development of domesticated plants and animals. In both parts of the world, peoples at the end of the ice age began to experiment with plants. By around 14,000 years ago in the Old World, and 10,000 years ago in the New World, some species had been domesticated. While hunting and gathering did not disappear, the domestication of plants and animals became more important in the next period of cultural history, the Neolithic.

# Summary and Review

### The Last Ice Age

9.1 Describe the environment of the Upper Paleolithic world.

- • The period of cultural history known as the Upper Paleolithic in Europe, the Near East, and Asia or the Later Stone Age in Africa dates from about 40,000 years ago to about 14,000–10,000 years ago.
- • An ice age dominated this period. Glaciers covered much of northern Europe and North America. North Africa was much wetter than today and South Asia drier.

![](_page_15_Picture_6.jpeg)

How did ice age conditions during the Upper Paleolithic period affect the environment?

### Upper Paleolithic Europe

9.2 Describe Upper Paleolithic tools and cultures in Europe.

- • The Upper Paleolithic tool kit is characterized by the preponderance of blades; there were also burins, bone and antler tools, and (later) microliths.
- • In many respects, Upper Paleolithic lifestyles were similar to lifestyles before. People were still mainly hunters, gatherers, and fishers who probably lived in highly mobile bands. They made their camps out in the open and in caves and rock shelters.
- • This period is also characterized by a variety of new developments: new tool-making techniques, evidence of trade among groups, the emergence of art, population growth, and new inventions such as the bow and arrow, the spear thrower (atlatl), and the harpoon.

![](_page_15_Picture_13.jpeg)

Why does the emergence of art suggest that language might also have been developing during the Upper Paleolithic?

#### Upper Paleolithic Cultures in Africa and Asia

9.3 Describe Upper Paleolithic migration from Africa to Asia.

• Upper Paleolithic peoples spread throughout the world. The first Upper Paleolithic cultures are found in Africa about 60,000 years ago but had spread to South and East Asia by about 50,000 years ago and to New Guinea and Australia by about 40,000 years ago.

- • In North Africa Upper Paleolithic peoples hunted large animals on grasslands. They lived in small communities located within easy access to water and other resources and moved regularly, probably to follow the animal herds. Trade took place between local groups.
- • In South Asia, peoples developed an increasingly sedentary lifestyle along the banks of freshwater streams.

How did the Upper Paleolithic cultures of Europe, Africa, and Asia differ?

### The Earliest Humans and Their Cultures in the New World

9.4 Evaluate scenarios for the migration of humans into the New World.

- • The earliest remains of people in North America date to about 14,000 years ago. Migrations of humans to the New World took place some time after the emergence of *H. sapiens.*
- • The prevailing opinion is that humans migrated to the New World over a land bridge between Siberia and Alaska in the area of what is now the Bering Strait, or by boat along the Alaskan coast.
- • By about 11,000 years ago, there were many people living in both North and South America.
- • The Clovis people created unique projectile points that have a single long flake, or "flute," knocked from their base to thin them and make them easy to haft. They lived by hunting big game animals, especially bison and mammoth.
- • Paleo-Indians had diverse ways of life, some hunting and following herds, some relying on fish and shellfish, and others developing semi-sedentary riverine communities.

What were the basic features of Paleo-Indian life?

#### The End of the Upper Paleolithic

9.5 Relate the end of the Upper Paleolithic to climate change and the development of Maglemosian culture.

- • At the end of the ice age, around 14,000 years ago, the climate began to become more temperate. Many large animals that Upper Paleolithic peoples relied upon for food went extinct, and new warmer-adapted plants provided rich, new food sources.
- • Evidence from the Maglemosian culture of northern Europe shows adaptations from big game hunting to

reliance on smaller animal food sources. Maglemosians used stone tools to chop down trees and use the wood for shelter and canoes.

• Around the world, people began to use more plant foods and a broader range of resources overall. In many parts of the world, people began experimenting with domesticating plants and animals as they began to follow a more sedentary lifestyle.

How did climate change at the end of the Upper Paleolithic period lead to other cultural changes?

## Think on it

- 1. What is the significance of differences between Middle Paleolithic and Upper Paleolithic tools in terms of human culture?
- 2. Upper Paleolithic cave paintings arouse our imaginations. We have described some research that tested ideas about what these paintings might mean. Can you think of other ways to understand the significance of cave art?
- 3. What factors might have led humans to colonize the New World?
