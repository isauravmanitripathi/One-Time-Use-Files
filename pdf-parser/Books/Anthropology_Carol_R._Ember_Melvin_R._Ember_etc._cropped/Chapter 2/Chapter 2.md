The intellectuals who developed science in the mid- $17$ th century understood very well  $\perp$  that human knowledge of the world could be biased and incomplete. Rather than rejecting the possibility of objective understanding, the founders of science created a way of generating understanding based on the rigorous testing of ideas. As anthropologist Philip Salzman explains:

The scientific method, the heart of science, was invented because it was understood that human error, wish-fulfillment, duplicity, dishonesty, and weakness would commonly distort research findings. The scientific requirements that the procedures of all studies must be specified in detail so that others could repeat them, and the actual replication of findings by other scientists in other venues, were established to minimize the distorting effects of human subjectivity and moral weakness in the quest for knowledge.<sup>1</sup>

Although one goal of anthropology is to understand what it means to be a human in a different cultural context, a goal for which science and its pursuit of explanations may not be appropriate, most anthropologists believe that objective knowledge about other cultures is possible through science.

### Explanations

An **explanation** is an answer to a *why* question. There are many types of explanations, some more satisfying than others. For example, suppose we ask why a society has a long postpartum sex taboo. We could guess that the people in that society want to abstain from sex for a year or so after the birth of a baby. Is this an explanation? Yes, because it does suggest that people have a purpose in practicing the custom; it therefore partly answers the  $why$  question. But such an explanation would not be very satisfying because it does not specify what the purpose of the custom might be. How about the idea that people have a long postpartum sex taboo because it is their tradition? That too is an explanation, but it is not satisfactory for a different reason. It is a *tautology*; that is, the thing to be explained (the taboo) is being explained by itself, by its prior existence. To explain something in terms of tradition is to say that people do it because they already do it, which is not informative. What kinds of explanations are more satisfactory, then? In science, investigators try to achieve two kinds of explanations: associations and theories.

### Associations or Relationships

One way of explaining something (an observation, an action, a custom) is to say how it conforms to a general principle or relationship. So to explain why the water left outside in the basin froze, we say that it was cold last night and that water freezes at  $32^{\circ}$ F ( $0^{\circ}$ C). The statement that water solidifies (becomes ice) at  $32^{\circ}$ F is a statement of a relationship or association between two variables—things or quantities that vary. In this case, variation in the state of water (liquid vs. solid) is related to variation in the temperature of the air (above vs. below  $32^{\circ}$ F). The truth of the relationship is suggested by repeated observations. In the physical sciences, such relationships are called **laws** when almost all scientists accept them. We find such explanations satisfactory because they allow us to predict what will happen in the future or to understand something that has happened regularly in the past.

In the social sciences, associations are usually stated *probabilistically*; that is, we say that two or more variables

association between two variables: water and temperature. A theory explains why an association exists.

tend to be related in a predictable way, which means that there are usually some exceptions. For example, to explain why a society has a long postpartum sex taboo, we can point to the association (or correlation) that John Whiting found in a worldwide sample of societies: Societies with apparently low-protein diets tend to have long postpartum sex taboos.2 We call the relationship between low-protein diets and the sex taboo a **statistical association**, which means that the observed relationship is unlikely to be due to chance.

#### Theories

Even though laws and statistical associations explain by relating what is to be explained to other things, we want to know more: why those laws or associations exist. Why does water freeze at 32°F? Why do societies with low-protein diets tend to have long postpartum sex taboos? Therefore, scientists try to formulate theories that will explain the observed relationships (laws and statistical associations).3

**Theories**—explanations of laws and statistical associations—are more complicated than the observed relationships they are intended to explain. It is difficult to be precise about what a theory is. By way of example, let us return to the question of why some societies have long postpartum sex taboos. We have already seen that a known statistical association can be used to help explain it. If a society has a low-protein diet, it will generally have a long postpartum sex taboo. But most people would ask additional questions: Why does a low-protein diet explain the taboo? What is the mechanism by which a society with such a diet develops the custom of a long postpartum sex taboo? A theory is intended to answer such questions.

John Whiting theorized that a long postpartum sex taboo may be an adaptation to certain conditions. Particularly in tropical areas, where the major food staples are low in protein, babies are vulnerable to the protein-deficiency disease called *kwashiorkor.* But if a baby could continue to nurse for a long time, it might have more of a chance to survive. The postpartum sex taboo might be adaptive, Whiting's theory suggests, because it increases the likelihood of a baby's survival. That is, if a mother puts off having another baby for a while, the first baby might have a better chance to survive because it can be fed mother's milk for a longer time. Whiting suggests that parents may be aware, whether unconsciously or consciously, that having another baby too soon might jeopardize the survival of the first baby, and so they might decide that abstaining from intercourse for more than a year after the birth of the first baby would be a good idea.

As this example of a theory illustrates, there are differences between a theory and an association. A theory is usually more complicated, containing a series of statements. An association usually states quite simply that there is a relationship between two or more measured variables. Another difference is that although a theory may mention some things that are observable, such as the presence of a long postpartum sex taboo, it contains other concepts or statements that could not be observed. For example, with regard to Whiting's theory, it would be difficult to find out if the people who adopted the custom of a long postpartum sex taboo had some awareness that babies would thereby have a better chance to survive. Then, too, the concept of adaptation—that some characteristic promotes greater reproductive success—is difficult to verify because of the challenge of finding out whether different individuals or groups have different rates of reproduction because they do or do not practice the supposedly adaptive custom. Thus, some concepts or implications in a theory are unobservable (at least at the present time), and only some aspects may be observable. In contrast, statistical associations or laws are based entirely on observations.4

#### Why Theories Cannot Be Proved

Many people think that the theories they learned in physics or chemistry courses have been proved. Unfortunately, many students get that impression because their teachers present lessons in an authoritative manner. Scientists and philosophers of science now generally agree that no theory can be said to be proved or unquestionably true, although some theories may have considerable evidence supporting them. This is because many of the concepts and ideas in theories are not directly observable and therefore not directly verifiable. For example, scientists may try to explain how light behaves by postulating

**Statistical association** A relationship or correlation between two or more variables that is unlikely to be due to chance.

**Theories** Explanations of associations or laws.

#### **Theoretical construct** Something that cannot be observed or verified directly.

**Falsification** Showing that a theory seems to be wrong by finding that implications or predictions derivable from it are not consistent with objectively collected data.

**Hypotheses** Predictions, which may be derived from theories, about how variables are related.

that it consists of particles called photons, but photons cannot be observed, even with the most powerful microscope. So, exactly what a photon looks like and exactly how it works remain in the realm of the unprovable. The photon is a **theoretical construct**, something that cannot be observed or verified directly. Because all theories contain such constructs, theories cannot be proved entirely or with absolute certainty.5

Why should we bother with theories, then, if we cannot prove that they are true? Perhaps the main advantage of a theory as a kind of explanation is that it may lead to new understanding or knowledge. A theory can suggest new relationships or imply new predictions that might be supported or confirmed by new research. For example, Whiting's theory about long postpartum sex taboos has implications that researchers could investigate. Because the theory discusses how a long postpartum sex taboo might be adaptive, we would expect that certain changes would result in the taboo's disappearance. For example, suppose people adopted either mechanical birth-control devices or began to give supplementary high-protein foods to babies. With birth control, a family could space births without abstaining from sex, so we would expect the custom of postpartum abstinence to disappear. Additionally, we would expect it to disappear with protein supplements for babies because *kwashiorkor* would then be less likely to afflict the babies. Whiting's ideas might also prompt investigators to try to find out whether parents are consciously or unconsciously aware of the problem of close birth spacing in areas with low supplies of protein.

Although theories cannot be proved, they are rejectable. The method of **falsification**, which shows that a theory seems to be wrong, is the main way that theories are judged.6 Scientists derive implications or predictions that should be true if the theory is correct. So, for example, Whiting predicted that societies with long postpartum sex taboos would be found more often in the tropics than in temperate regions and that they would be likely to have low-protein food supplies. Such predictions of what might be found are called **hypotheses**. If the predictions turn out not to be correct, the researcher is obliged to conclude that something may be wrong with the theory or something wrong with the test of the theory. Theories that are not falsified are accepted for the time being because the available evidence seems to be consistent with them. But remember that no matter how much the available evidence seems to support a theory, we can never be certain it is true. There is always the possibility that some implication of it, some hypothesis derivable from it, will not be confirmed in the future.

## A Brief History of Anthropological Theory

John Whiting's theory explaining why a long postpartum sex taboo might be adaptive is only one of many theories that anthropologists employ in their research. The history of anthropology reflects broad themes the types of theories anthropologists have used. Whiting's theory, for example, can be placed within the body of ecological theories. Let's take a look at some of the variety of **theoretical orientations** that have been important to anthropologists.

#### Early Evolutionism

The theory of evolution had a strong impact on anthropology in the 19th century. The prevailing view was that culture generally develops (or evolves) in a uniform and progressive manner, just as Darwin argued species did. It was thought that most societies pass through the same series of stages, to arrive ultimately at a common end. Two 19th-century anthropologists whose writings exemplified the theory that culture generally evolves uniformly and progressively were Edward B. Tylor (1832–1917) and Lewis Henry Morgan (1818–1881). Both maintained that culture evolved from the simple to the complex and that all societies passed through three basic stages of development: from savagery through barbarism to civilization.<sup>7</sup> "Progress" was therefore possible for all. To account for cultural variation, Tylor and Morgan postulated that different contemporary societies were at different stages of evolution. According to this view, the "simpler"

peoples of the day had not yet reached "higher" stages. Though important at the beginning of anthropology, the evolutionism of Tylor and Morgan is largely rejected today.

#### "Race" Theory

Evolutionism also influenced another branch of early anthropological theory, one that posited that the reason human cultures differed in their behaviors was because they represented separate subspecies of humans, or "races." This idea was also influenced by the fact that, by the 19th century at least, it became clear that few cultures were being "civilized" in the way Europeans expected. Rather than attribute this to the strength of cultural tradition, some attributed it to the innate capabilities of the people—in other words, to their "race." Members of "uncivilized races" were, by their very nature, incapable of being "civilized." Such ideas were widely held during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and American anthropology played a large role in showing that "race" theory was unsupported in a variety of contexts. Unfortunately, "race" theory persists in some disciplines.8

#### Boasian Anthropology

The beginning of the 20th century brought the end of evolutionism's reign in American anthropology. Its leading opponent was Franz Boas (1858–1942), whose main disagreement with the evolutionists involved their assumption that universal laws governed all human culture. Boas pointed out that these 19th-century "armchair anthropologists" lacked sufficient data to formulate many useful generalizations. Boas also strongly opposed "race" theory, and made significant contributions to the study of human variation that demonstrated how supposedly "racial" characteristics actually varied depending on where a person grew up.9

Boas stressed the idea that single cultural traits had to be studied in the context of the society in which they appeared. According to the method he advocated, the essence of science is to mistrust all expectations and to rely only on facts. But, as we argue in this chapter, collecting data without some preliminary theorizing, without ideas about what to expect, is problematic, for the facts that are most important may be ignored whereas irrelevant ones may be recorded. Boas's concern with innumerable local details did not encourage a belief that it might be possible to explain the major variations in culture, and by the 1950s many anthropologists felt that the Boasian focus on describing cultures rather than explaining how and why cultures varied limited the scope of anthropology. Two major approaches to anthropology emerged from this movement away from description: ecological and interpretive.

#### Ecological Approaches

Julian Steward (1902–1972) was one of the first to advocate the study of **cultural ecology** the analysis of the relationship between a culture and its environment. Steward felt that the explanation for some aspects of cultural variation could be found in the adaptation of societies to their particular environments.10 Cultural ecologists assume that cultural adaptation involves the mechanism of *natural selection*—the more frequent survival and reproduction of the better adapted. Environment, including the physical and social environments, affects the development of culture traits in that "individuals or populations behaving in certain different ways have different degrees of success in survival and reproduction and, consequently, in the transmission of their ways of behaving from generation to generation."11

Today anthropologists who refer to themselves as evolutionary or behavioral ecologists (as opposed to cultural ecologists) explore how particular characteristics may be adaptive for an individual in a given environment (cultural ecologists tend to focus on the group or culture more than the individual).12 *Adaptive* means the ability of individuals to get their genes into future generations. This viewpoint implies that behavior is transmitted in some way (by genes or learning) to people who share your genes (usually offspring).13 If a certain behavior is adaptive for individuals in a particular environment (or a particular historical context in which these individuals are able to reproduce more than others), it should become more widespread in future generations as the individuals with those traits increase in number. One important contemporary idea, dual-inheritance theory, gives much more weight to culture as part of the evolutionary process. Dual inheritance refers to both genes and culture playing different but nonetheless important and interactive roles in transmitting traits to future generations.14

### Current Research and Issues

#### **Evaluating Alternative Theories**

n working among the Abelam of New Guinea, Richard Scaglion was puzzled why they invest so much energy in growing giant ceremonial yams, sometimes more than 10 feet long. Also, why do they abstain from sex for six months while they grow them? Of course, to try to understand, we need to know much more about the Abelam way of life. Scaglion had read about them, lived among them, and talked to them, but, as many ethnographers have discovered, answers to why questions don't just leap out at you. Answers, at least tentative ones, often come from theoretical orientations that suggest how or where to look for answers. Scaglion considers several possibilities. As Donald Tuzin had suggested for a nearby group, the Plains Arapesh, yams may be symbols of, or stand for, shared cultural understandings. (Looking for the meanings of symbols is a kind of interpretative approach to ethnographic data.) The Abelam think of yams as having souls that appreciate tranquility. Yams also have family lines; at marriage, the joining of family lines is symbolized by planting different yam lines in the same garden. During the yam-growing cycle (remember that yams appreciate tranquility), lethal

warfare and conflict become channeled mostly into competitive but nonlethal yam-growing contests. So yam growing may be functional in the sense that it helps to foster harmony.

Then again, ceremonial yam growing may have adaptive ecological consequences. Just as the Tsembaga pig feasts seemed to keep human population in line with resources, Scaglion thinks that ceremonial yam growing did too. Growing pig populations damage gardens and create conflicts, but pigs are also given away during competitive yam ceremonies, so the pig population declines. Wild animals that are hunted also have a chance to replenish themselves because hunting is frowned upon during the yam-growing cycle.

As Scaglion's discussion illustrates, theoretical orientations help researchers derive explanations. They do not have to be "rival" explanations, in the sense that one has to be right and others wrong; more than one theory may help explain some phenomenon. But we can't assume that a theory is correct and helps us to understand just because it sounds good. The important point is that we need something more to evaluate theory.

We have to find ways to test a theory against evidence. Until we do that, we really don't know how many, or if indeed any, of the theories available are helpful.

The ecological approaches have led to an active program of research in anthropology. However, these approaches have aroused considerable controversy, particularly from those cultural anthropologists who do not believe that biological considerations or cultural adaptations have much to do with understanding culture.

#### Interpretive Approaches

Since the 1960s, writers in the field of literary criticism have influenced the development of a variety of "interpretive" approaches in cultural anthropology, particularly with respect to ethnography.<sup>15</sup> Clifford Geertz (1926–2006) popularized the idea that a culture is like a literary text that can be analyzed for meaning. According to Geertz, ethnographers choose to interpret the meaning of things in the cultures they study that are of interest to themselves. Then they try to convey their interpretations of cultural meaning to people of their own culture. Thus, according to Geertz, ethnographers are a kind of selective intercultural translator.<sup>16</sup>

For many interpretive anthropologists, the goal of anthropology is to understand what it means to be a person living in a particular culture, rather than to explain why cultures vary. The task of understanding meaning, these scholars claim, cannot be achieved scientifically, but can only be approached through forms of literary analysis.

Many of these anthropologists think that interpretation is the only achievable goal in cultural anthropology because they do not believe it is possible to describe or measure cultural phenomena in objective or unbiased ways. Scientific anthropologists do not agree. To be

sure, interpretive ethnographies provide insights into other cultures. But we do not have to believe what an interpretation suggests, no matter how eloquently it is stated. (We are rarely given objective evidence to support the interpretation.) As we discuss below, scientific researchers have developed many techniques for minimizing bias and increasing the objectivity of measurement. Thus, interpretative anthropologists who deny the possibility of scientific understanding of human behavior and thinking may not know how much has been achieved so far by scientific studies of cultural phenomena. Let's take a look at how scientific anthropologists test explanations of cultural phenomenon.

## Evidence: Testing Explanations

In any field of investigation, theories are generally the most plentiful commodity, apparently because of the human predisposition to try to make sense of the world. It is necessary, then, for us to have procedures that enable us to select from among the many available theories those that are more likely to be correct. As Peter Caws pointed out, "Just as mutations arise naturally but are not all beneficial, so hypotheses [theories] emerge naturally but are not all correct. If progress is to occur, therefore, we require a superfluity of hypotheses and also a mechanism of selection."17 In other words, generating a theory or interpretation is not enough. We need some reliable method of testing whether or not that theory is likely to be correct. If a theory is not correct, it may detract from our efforts to achieve understanding by misleading us into thinking the problem is already solved.

The strategy in all kinds of testing in science is to predict what one would expect to find if a particular theory were correct, and then to conduct an investigation to see if the prediction is generally consistent with the data. If the prediction is not supported, the investigator is obliged to accept the possibility that the theory is wrong. If, however, the prediction holds true, then the investigator is entitled to say that evidence supports the theory. Thus, conducting research designed to test expectations derived from theory allows researchers to eliminate some theories and to accept others, at least tentatively.

#### Operationalization and Measurement

We test predictions derived from a theory to see if the theory may be correct—to see if it is consistent with observable events or conditions in the real world. A theory and the predictions derived from it are not useful if there is no way to measure the events or conditions mentioned in the predictions. If there is no way of relating the theory to observable events, it does not matter how good the theory sounds; it is still not a useful scientific theory.18 To transform theoretical predictions into statements that might be verified, a researcher provides an **operational definition** of each of the concepts or variables mentioned in the prediction. An operational definition is a description of the procedure that is followed to measure the variable.19

Whiting predicted that societies with a low-protein diet would have a long postpartum sex taboo. Amount of protein in the diet is a variable; some societies have more, others have less. Length of the postpartum sex taboo is a variable; a society may have a short taboo or a long taboo. Whiting operationally defined the first variable, *amount of protein,* in terms of staple foods.20 For example, if a society depended mostly on root and tree crops (such as cassava and bananas), Whiting rated the society as having low protein. If the society depended mostly on cereal crops (such as wheat, barley, corn, oats), he rated it as having moderate protein because cereal crops have more protein by weight than root and tree crops. If the society depended mostly on hunting, fishing, or herding for food, he rated it as having high protein. The other variable in Whiting's prediction, *length of postpartum sex taboo,* was operationalized as follows: A society was rated as having a long taboo if couples customarily abstained from sex for more than a year after the birth of a baby; abstention for a year or less was considered a short taboo.

Specifying an operational definition for each variable is extremely important because it allows other investigators to check a researcher's results.21 Science depends on *replication,* the repetition of results. Only when many researchers observe a particular association can we call that association or relationship a law. Providing operational definitions is also

extremely important because it allows others to evaluate whether a measure is appropriate. Only when we are told exactly how something was measured can we judge whether the measure reflects what it is supposed to reflect. Specifying measures publicly is so important in science that we are obliged to be skeptical of any conclusions offered by a researcher who fails to say how variables were measured.

To **measure** something is to say how it compares with other things on some scale of variation. People often assume that a measuring device is always a physical instrument, such as a scale or a ruler, but physical devices are not the only way to measure something. *Classification* is also a form of measurement. When we classify people as male or female or employed versus unemployed, we are dividing them into *types.* Deciding which type they belong to is a kind of measurement because doing so allows us to compare them. We can also measure things by deciding which cases or examples have more or less of something (e.g., more or less protein in the diet). The measures employed in physical science are usually based on scales that allow us to assign numbers to each case; we measure height in meters and weight in grams, for example. However we measure our variables, the fact that we can measure them means that we can test our hypotheses to see if the predicted relationships actually exist, at least most of the time.

#### Sampling

After deciding how to measure the variables in some predicted relationship, investigators must decide how to select which cases to study to see if the predicted relationship holds. If the prediction is about the behavior of people, the sampling decision involves which people to observe. If the prediction is about an association between societal customs, the sampling decision involves which societies to study. Investigators must decide not only which cases to choose but also how many to choose. No researcher can investigate all the possible cases, and so choices must be made. Some choices are better than others. The best sample is almost always some kind of random sample. A **random sample** is one in which all cases selected have an equal chance of being included in the sample. Almost all statistical tests used to evaluate the results of research require random sampling because only results based on a random sample can be assumed to be probably true for some larger set or universe of cases.

Before researchers can sample randomly, they must specify the **sampling universe**, that is, the list of cases to be sampled from. Suppose an anthropologist is doing fieldwork in a society. Unless the society is very small, it is usually not practical to use the whole society as the sampling universe. Because most fieldworkers want to remain in a community for a considerable

length of time, the community usually becomes the sampling universe. If a cross-cultural researcher wants to test an explanation, it is necessary to sample the world's societies. But we do not have descriptions of all the societies—past and present—that have existed in the world. Thus, samples are usually drawn from published lists of described societies that have been classified or coded according to standard cultural variables,22 or they are drawn from the Human Relations Area Files *eHRAF World Cultures,* a finely-indexed, online, and annually growing collection of ethnographies on more than 285 societies—past and present—around the world.23 There is also a collection of archaeological traditions—*eHRAF Archaeology*.

Random sampling is not often employed in anthropology, but a nonrandom sample might still be fairly representative if the investigator has not personally chosen the cases for study. We should be particularly suspicious of any sample that may reflect the investigator's own biases or interests. For example, if investigators pick only the people with whom they are friendly, the sample is suspicious. If researchers select sample cases (i.e., societies and traditions) because books on them happen to be on their own bookshelves, such samples are also suspicious. A sampling procedure should be designed to get a fair, unbiased representation of the sampling universe. If we want to increase our chances of getting a representative sample, we have to use a random sampling procedure. To do so, we conventionally number the cases in the statistical universe and then use a table of random numbers to draw our sample cases.

#### Statistical Evaluation

When researchers have measured the variables of interest for all the sample cases, they are ready to see if the predicted relationship actually exists in the data. Remember, the results may not turn out to be what the theory predicts. Sometimes researchers construct a *contingency table,* like that shown in Table 2.1, to see if the variables are associated as predicted. In Whiting's sample of 172 societies, each case is assigned to a box, or cell, in the table, depending on how the society is measured on the two variables of interest. For example, a society that has a long postpartum sex taboo and a low-protein diet is placed in the third row of the Long Duration column. (In Whiting's sample [see Table 2.1], there are 27 such societies.) A society that has a short postpartum sex taboo and a low-protein diet is placed in the third row in the Short Duration column. (There are 20 such societies in the sample.) The statistical question is: Does the way the cases are distributed in the six central cells of the table generally support Whiting's prediction? If we looked just at the table, we might not know what to answer. Many cases appear to be in the expected places. For example, most of the high-protein cases

(47 of 62) have short taboos, and most of the low-protein cases (27 of 47) have long taboos. But there are also many exceptions (e.g., 20 cases have low protein and a short taboo). So, although many cases appear to be in the expected places, there are also many exceptions. Do the exceptions invalidate the prediction? How many exceptions would compel us to reject the hypothesis? Here is where we resort to *statistical tests of significance.*

Statisticians have devised various tests that tell us how "perfect" a result must be to convince us to believe that there is probably an association between the variables of interest, and that one variable generally predicts the other. Essentially, every statistical result is evaluated in the same objective way. We ask: What is the chance that this result is purely accidental, that there is no association at all between the two variables? Although some of the mathematical ways of answering this question are complicated, the answer always involves a **probability value** (or *p***-value**)—the likelihood that the observed result or a stronger one could have occurred by chance. The statistical test used by Whiting gives a *p*-value of less than .01 (*p* < .01) for the observed result. In other words, there is less than 1 chance out of 100 that the relationship observed is purely accidental. A *p*-value of less than .01 is a fairly low probability; most social scientists conventionally agree to call any result with a *p*-value of .05 or less (5 or fewer chances out of 100) a **statistically significant**, or probably true, result. When we describe relationships or associations in the rest of this book, we are almost always referring to results that have been found to be statistically significant.

But why should a probably true relationship have any exceptions? If a theory is really correct, shouldn't *all* the cases fit? There are many reasons why we can never expect a perfect result. First, even if a theory is correct (e.g., if a low-protein diet really does favor the adoption of a long postpartum sex taboo), there may still be other causes that we have not investigated. Some of the societies could have a long taboo even though they have high protein. For example, societies that depend mostly on hunting for their food, and would therefore be classified as having a high-protein diet, may have a problem carrying infants from one campsite to another and may practice a long postpartum sex taboo so that two infants will not have to be carried at the same time.

Exceptions to the predicted relationship might also occur because of *cultural lag.*<sup>24</sup> Cultural lag occurs when change in one aspect of culture takes time to produce change in another aspect. Suppose that a society recently changed crops and is now no longer a low-protein society but still practices the taboo. This society would be an exception to the predicted relationship, but it might fit the theory if it stopped practicing the taboo in a few years. Measurement inaccuracy is another source of exception. Whiting's measure of protein, which is based on the major sources of food, is not a very precise measure of protein in the diet. It does not take into account the possibility that a "tree crop" society might get a lot of protein from fishing or raising pigs. Some supposedly low-protein societies might therefore have been misclassified, which could be one reason why there are 20 cases in the lowest cell in the left-hand column of Table 2.1. Measurement error usually produces exceptions.

Significant statistical associations that are predictable from a theory offer tentative support for the theory. But much more is needed before we can be fairly confident about the theory. Replication is needed to confirm whether other researchers can reproduce the predictions using other samples. Other predictions should be derived from the theory to see if they too are supported. The theory should be pitted against alternative explanations to see which

theory works better. We may have to combine theories if the alternative explanations also predict the relationship in question. The research process in science thus requires time and patience. Perhaps most important, it requires that researchers be humble. No matter how wonderful one's own theory seems, it is important to acknowledge that it may be wrong. If we do not acknowledge that possibility, we cannot be motivated to test our theories. If we don't test our theories, we can never tell the difference between a better or worse theory, and we will be saddled forever with our present ignorance. In science, knowledge or understanding is explained variation. Thus, if we want to understand more, we have to keep testing our beliefs against sets of objective evidence that could contradict our beliefs.

### Types of Research in Anthropology

Anthropologists use several methods to conduct research. Each has certain advantages and disadvantages in generating and testing explanations. The types of research in anthropology can be classified according to two criteria. One is the spatial scope of the study (e.g., the analysis of a single society, analysis of societies in a region, or analysis of a worldwide sample of societies). The other criterion is the temporal scope of the study—historical versus nonhistorical. Combinations of these criteria are shown in Table 2.2.

In this section, we mostly discuss research strategies in cultural anthropology. However, most of these have parallels in archaeology and biological anthropology, as Table 2.2 makes clear. Archaeology and biological anthropology have special methods, and we devote the last section of the chapter to some of those methods.

#### Ethnography

Around the beginning of the 20th century, anthropologists realized that, if they were to produce anything of scientific value, they would have to study their subject in depth. To describe cultures more accurately, they started to live among the people they were studying. They observed, and even took part in, the important events of those societies and carefully questioned the people about their native customs. This method is known as **participant-observation**. Participant-observation always involves **fieldwork**, which is firsthand experience with the people being studied, but fieldwork may also involve other methods, such as conducting a census or a survey.25

Fieldwork, the cornerstone of modern anthropology, is the means by which most anthropological information is obtained. Regardless of other methods that anthropologists may use, participant-observation conducted usually for a year or more is regarded as

2.4 Differentiate the types of research in anthropology.

**Participant-observation** Living among the people being studied—observing, questioning, and (when possible) taking part in the important events of the group. Writing or otherwise recording notes on observations, questions asked and answered, and things to check out later are parts of participant-observation.

**Fieldwork** Firsthand experience with the people being studied and the usual means by which anthropological information is obtained. Regardless of other methods that anthropologists may use (e.g., censuses, surveys), fieldwork usually involves participantobservation for an extended period of time, often a year or more. See Participant-observation.

fundamental. In contrast to the casual descriptions of travelers and adventurers, anthropologists' descriptions record, describe, analyze, and eventually formulate a picture of the culture, or at least part of it.26 After doing fieldwork, an anthropologist may prepare an *ethnography,* a description and analysis of a single society.

How an anthropologist goes about doing long-term participant-observation in another culture—and, more important, doing it well—is not so straightforward. Much of it depends on the person, the culture, and the interaction between the two. Without a doubt, the experience is physically and psychologically demanding, comparable often to a rite of passage. Although it helps enormously to learn the local language before going, often it is not possible to do so, and so most anthropologists find themselves struggling to communicate in addition to trying to figure out how to behave properly. Participant-observation carries its own dilemma. Participation implies living like the people who are being studied, trying to understand subjectively what they think and feel by doing what they do, whereas observation implies a certain amount of objectivity and detachment.27 Because participant-observation is such a personal experience, it is not surprising that anthropologists have begun to realize that *reflecting* on their experiences and their personal interaction with the people they live with is an important part of understanding the enterprise.

An essential part of the participant-observation process is finding some knowledgeable people who are willing to work with you (anthropologists call them *informants*) to help you interpret what you observe and tell you about aspects of the culture that you may not have a chance to see or may not be entitled to see. For example, it is not likely that you will see many weddings in a village of 200 people in a year or two of fieldwork. So how can you know who will be a good informant? It is obviously important to find people who are easy to talk to and who understand what information you need. But how do you know who is knowledgeable? You can't just assume that the people you get along with have the most knowledge. (Besides, knowledge is often specialized; one person may know much more about some subjects than others.) At a minimum, you have to try out a few different people to compare what they tell you about a subject. What if they disagree? How do you know who is more trustworthy or accurate? Fortunately, formal methods have been developed to help anthropologists select the most knowledgeable informants. One method, called the cultural consensus model, relies on the principle that those things that most informants

agree on are probably cultural. After you establish which things appear to be cultural by asking a sample of informants the same questions about a particular cultural domain, it will be easy to discover which informants are very likely to give answers that closely match the cultural consensus. These individuals are your best bets to be the most knowledgeable in that domain.28 It may seem paradoxical, but the most knowledgeable and helpful individuals are not necessarily "typical" individuals. Many anthropologists have pointed out that key informants are likely to feel somewhat marginal in their culture. After all, why would they want to spend so much time with the visiting anthropologist?29

Participant-observation is valuable for understanding some aspects of culture, particularly the things that are the most public, readily talked about, and most widely agreed upon. But more systematic methods are important too: mapping, house-to-house censuses, behavior observations (e.g., to determine how people spend their time), as well as focused interviews with a sample of informants.

Ethnographies and ethnographic articles on particular topics provide much of the essential data for all kinds of studies in cultural anthropology. To make a comparison of societies in a given region or worldwide, anthropologists would require ethnographic data on many societies. With regard to the goal of generating theory, ethnography—with its in-depth, firsthand, long-term observation—provides investigators with a wealth of descriptive material covering a wide range of phenomena. Thus, it may stimulate interpretations about the way different aspects of the culture are related to each other and to features of the environment. Ethnographers in the field have the opportunity to get to know the context of a society's customs by directly asking the people about those customs and by observing the phenomena that appear to be associated with those practices. In addition, ethnographers who develop a possible explanation for some custom can test that hunch by collecting new information related to it. In this sense, ethnographers are similar to physicians who are trying to understand why a patient has certain symptoms of illness.

Although ethnography is extremely useful for generating explanations, a field study of a single site does not generally provide sufficient data to test a hypothesis. For example, an ethnographer may think that a particular society practices *polygyny* (one man married to two or more women simultaneously) because it has more women than men. But the ethnographer could not be reasonably sure that this explanation was correct unless the results of a comparative study of a sample of societies showed that most polygynous societies have more women than men. After all, the fact that one society has both these conditions could be a historical accident rather than a result of some necessary connection between the two conditions.

#### Ethnography as Source Material

Ethnography is a valuable source of information for anthropologists in all the subfields of the discipline. Data from ethnographies is particularly useful in cross-cultural research and remains the single best source of information on the many aspects of culture that anthropologists seek to understand. Because undertaking ethnographic research is time-consuming and challenging, however, the available data on a particular culture may be several decades old. How, then, do we know whether the data are still valid? The answer lies in how the concept of time is treated by anthropologists. Changes in fundamental cultural beliefs, customs, and traits have occurred slowly in most cultures—a fact that explains why anthropologists use the present tense, or the so-called ethnographic present, in their written observations. It can safely be assumed that general observations will probably hold true whether the ethnography was written 20 years or 10 years ago. However, anthropologists are also aware that dramatic cultural change occurs. When using ethnographic data from several cultures, anthropologists make sure that all of the information was gathered in the same time period. That way, the data are considered valid for each of the cultures at the same point in time and a comparison can be made reliably.

#### Within-Culture Comparisons

Ethnographers could test a theory within one society if they decide to compare individuals, families, households, communities, or districts. The natural variability that exists can be used to create a comparison. Suppose we want to verify Whiting's assumption that longer postpartum taboos enhance the survival of babies in a society with a low-protein diet. Although

almost all couples might practice a long postpartum sex taboo because it is customary, some couples might not adhere to the taboo consistently, and some couples might not conceive quickly after the taboo is lifted. So we would expect some variation in spacing between births. If we collected information on the births of each mother and the survival outcome of each birth, we would be able to compare the survival rates of children born a short time after the mother's last pregnancy with those of children born after longer intervals. A significantly higher survival rate for the births after longer intervals would support Whiting's theory. What if some communities within the society had access to more protein than others? If Whiting's theory is correct, those communities with more protein should also have a higher survival rate for babies. If there were variation in the length of the postpartum sex taboo, the communities with more protein should have shorter taboos.

Whether or not we can design intracultural tests of hypotheses depends on whether we have sufficient variability in the variables of the hypotheses. We do more often than not, and we can make use of that variation to test hypotheses within a culture.

#### Regional Controlled Comparisons

In a regional controlled comparison, anthropologists compare ethnographic information obtained from societies found in a particular region—societies that presumably have similar histories and occupy similar environments. Anthropologists who conduct a regional comparison are apt to be familiar with the complex of cultural features associated with that region. These features may provide a good understanding of the context of the phenomenon that is to be explained. An anthropologist's knowledge of the region under study, however, is probably not as great as the ethnographer's knowledge of a single society. Still, the anthropologist's understanding of local details is greater in a regional comparison than in a worldwide comparison. The worldwide comparison is necessarily so broad that the investigator is unlikely to know a great deal about any of the societies being compared.

The regional controlled comparison is useful not only for generating explanations but also for testing them. Because some of the societies being compared will have the characteristic that is to be explained and some will not, anthropologists can determine whether the conditions hypothesized to be related are in fact related, at least in that region. We must remember, however, that two or more conditions may be related in one region for reasons peculiar to that region. Therefore, an explanation supported in one region may not fit others.

#### Cross-Cultural Research

Anthropologists can generate interpretations on the basis of worldwide comparisons by looking for differences between those societies having and those lacking a particular characteristic. But the most common use of worldwide comparisons has been to test explanations. An example is Whiting's test of his theory about the adaptive functions of a long postpartum sex taboo. Recall that Whiting hypothesized that, if his theory were correct, variation in protein supplies in the adult diet should predict variation in the duration of the postpartum sex taboo. Crosscultural researchers first identify conditions that should generally be associated if a particular theory is correct. Then they look at a worldwide sample of societies to see if the expected association generally holds true. Although it is possible for cross-cultural researchers to choose any set of societies upon which to test theories and hypotheses, it is preferable to avoid personal bias in the selection of the sample societies. One of the worst possible samples would be to choose the ethnographies from your own bookshelf (you are unlikely to have collected them in a random way). As we indicated in the sampling section, most cross-culturalists choose a published sample of societies that was not constructed for any specific hypothesis test. Two of the most widely used samples are the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS) of 186 societies and the annually growing *eHRAF World Cultures.* Because HRAF actually contains ethnographies that are subject-indexed by paragraph, researchers can quickly find information to code a new variable across a large number of societies. In contrast, the SCCS sample contains pointers to ethnography, not ethnographies themselves. However, thousands of variables have now been coded by other researchers for this sample, so researchers who want to use data coded by others tend to use this sample30 or the overlap between the SCCS sample and eHRAF.31

The advantage of cross-cultural research is that the conclusion drawn from it is probably applicable to most societies, if the sample used for testing has been more or less randomly

selected and therefore is representative of the world. In other words, the results of a crosscultural study are probably applicable to most societies and most regions, in contrast with the results of a regional comparison, which may or may not be applicable to other regions.

As we have noted, the greater the number of societies examined in a study, the less likely investigators will have detailed knowledge of the societies involved. So, if a crosscultural test does not support a particular explanation, the investigators may not know enough about the sample societies to know how to modify the interpretation or come up with a new one. In this situation, the anthropologists may reexamine the details of one or more particular societies to stimulate fresh thinking on the subject. Another limitation of cross-cultural research, as a means of both generating and testing explanations, is that only those explanations for which the required information is generally available in ethnographies can be tested. Investigators interested in explaining something that has not been generally described must resort to some other research strategy to collect data.

#### Historical Research

*Ethnohistory* consists of studies based on descriptive materials about a single society at more than one point in time. It provides the essential data for historical studies of all types, just as ethnography provides the essential data for all nonhistorical types of research. Ethnohistorical

data may consist of sources other than the ethnographic reports prepared by anthropologists—accounts by explorers, missionaries, traders, and government officials. Ethnohistorians, like historians, cannot simply assume that all the documents they find are simply descriptions of fact; they were written by very different kinds of people with very different goals and purposes. So they need to separate carefully what may be fact from what may be speculative interpretation. To reconstruct how a culture changed over hundreds of years, where the natives left few or no written accounts, anthropologists have to seek out travelers' accounts and other historical documents that were written by non-natives. Mary Helms had to do this when she decided to do fieldwork among the Miskito of Nicaragua, to reconstruct how their life had changed under the conditions of European colonialism. She was particularly interested in discovering why the Miskito were able to preserve a lot of political independence.32

In terms of generating and testing hypotheses, studies of single societies over time tend to be subject to the same limitations as studies of single societies confined to a single period. Like their nonhistorical counterparts, studies that concentrate on a single society observed through time are likely to generate more than one hypothesis, but they do not generally provide the opportunity to establish with reasonable certainty which of those hypotheses is correct. Cross-cultural historical studies (of which we have only a few examples thus far) suffer from the opposite limitation. They provide ample means of testing hypotheses through comparison, but, because of the necessity of working with secondhand data, they are severely constrained in their ability to generate hypotheses derived from the available data.

There is, however, one advantage to historical studies of any type. The goal of theory in cultural anthropology is to explain variation in cultural patterns, that is, to specify what conditions will favor one cultural pattern rather than another. Such specification

![](_page_14_Picture_8.jpeg)

Ethnohistorians need to analyze pieces of information from a variety of sources such as the accounts of European explorers. Pictured here is a group of Roanoke Native Americans fishing in the late 1500s. It provides ethnohistorians with good information on how these people harvested fish.

requires us to assume that the supposed causal, or favoring, conditions antedated the pattern to be explained. Theories or explanations, then, imply a sequence of changes over time, which are the stuff of history. Therefore, if we want to come closer to an understanding of the reasons for the cultural variations we are investigating, we should examine historical sequences. They will help us determine whether the conditions we think caused various phenomena truly antedated those phenomena and thus might more reliably be said to have caused them. If we can examine historical sequences, we may be able to make sure that we do not put the cart before the horse.

The major impediment to historical research is that collecting and analyzing historical data—particularly when they come from the scattered accounts of explorers, missionaries, and traders—tends to be very time consuming. It may be more efficient to test explanations nonhistorically first to eliminate some interpretations. Only when an interpretation survives a nonhistorical test should we look to historical data to test the presumed sequence. Archaeological evidence is one answer to this problem; many archaeological sites contain evidence from several cultures that lived in that location over time. Even when sites contain evidence for only one period of time, sites dating from different times can be compared to examine historical trends.

### Studying the Distant Past

One goal of archaeological research is the description or reconstruction of what happened in the past. Archaeologists attempt to determine how people lived in a particular place at a particular time, and when and how their lifestyles changed. Also of interest, of course, is whether new populations carrying new cultures arrived, or whether people with a particular culture moved out of a given area. Creating histories of cultures and their changes over time is called, simply enough, **culture history**. Doing culture history was the primary goal of archaeology until the 1950s.33

A second major goal of archaeological research, and one that has become the primary goal since the 1950s, is testing specific explanations about human evolution and behavior. In part, this change in focus results from our increased knowledge about the past—the culture history of many areas is well known today. But this change is also due to changes going on in anthropology as a whole. Historical particularism was dominant in American anthropology until the 1950s. It suggested that variation in human cultures was best explained by considering the specific historical developments of particular cultures. Like the purpose of historical particularism, the purpose of culture history was to trace historical developments. After the 1950s, a variety of new approaches arose in anthropology, most of them sharing the idea that the environment and how humans use it actively shapes cultures and mostly explains cultural variability. Archaeology became a key tool for anthropologists attempting to understand how changes in the ways humans used the environment explained variation in human cultures. One of the results of this focus on hypothesis testing and human use of the environment was research on agricultural origins. Another was a concern with the rise of cities and states, which radically transformed human use of the environment. In addition to testing explanations, archaeology has a primary role within anthropology in its attempt to identify and understand general trends and patterns in human biological and cultural evolution. As we discussed earlier, cross-cultural research (comparative ethnography) has this goal as well. But only archaeology is able to look through long stretches of time and directly examine evolutionary trends. A major emphasis in paleoanthropology is demonstrating longterm trends and patterns in the biological evolution of humans. These trends and patterns help us understand how and why we have come to be the way we are.

Archaeologists and paleoanthropologists rely on four kinds of evidence to learn about the past: *artifacts, ecofacts, fossils,* and *features.*

#### Artifacts

Anything made or modified by humans is an **artifact**. The book you are reading now, the chair you are sitting in, the pen you are taking notes with are all artifacts. In fact, we are surrounded by artifacts, most of which we will lose or throw away. That is exactly how things

2.5 Describe the four kinds of evidence that archaeologists and paleoanthropologists find and how they analyze it.

**Culture history** A history of the cultures that lived in a given area over time. Until the 1950s, building such culture histories was a primary goal of archaeological research.

**Artifact** Any object made by a human.

enter what we call the "archaeological record." Think about it: How much garbage do you produce in a day? What kinds of things do you throw away? Mostly paper, probably, but also wood (from the ice cream bar you ate at lunch), plastic (like the pen that ran out of ink last night), and even metal (the dull blade on your razor). Into the garbage they go and out to the dump or landfill. Under the right conditions, many of those items will survive for future archaeologists to find. Most of the artifacts that make up the archaeological record are just this kind of mundane waste—the accumulated garbage of daily life that archaeologists may recover and examine to reconstruct what daily life was like long ago. By far the most common artifacts from the past are stone tools, which archaeologists call **lithics**. Indeed, lithics are the only kind of artifact available for 99 percent of human history.

#### Ecofacts

**Ecofacts** are natural objects that humans have used or affected. A good example is the bone from animals that people have eaten. These bones are somewhat like artifacts, but they haven't been made or modified by humans, just used and discarded by them. Another example is pollen found at archaeological sites. Because humans bring plants back to their houses to use, pollens from many plants are commonly found. These pollens may not have come from the same location. The only reason they are together is that they have been brought together by human use. Other examples are the remains of insect and animal pests that associate with humans, such as cockroaches and mice. Their remains are found in sites because they associate with humans and survive by taking advantage of the conditions that humans create. Their presence is in part caused by human presence, and thus they are also considered ecofacts.

#### Fossils

Fossils, although rare, are particularly informative about human biological evolution. **Fossils** may be impressions of an insect or leaf on a muddy surface that now is stone. A fossil may also consist of the actual hardened remains of an animal's skeletal structure. When an animal dies, the organic matter that made up its body begins to deteriorate. The teeth and skeletal structure are composed largely of inorganic mineral salts, and soon they are all that remains. Under most conditions, these parts eventually deteriorate too. But once in a great while, conditions are favorable for preservation—for instance, when volcanic ash, limestone, or highly mineralized groundwater is present to form a high-mineral environment. If the remains are buried under such circumstances, the minerals in the ground may become bound into the structure of the teeth or bone, hardening the remains and thus making them less likely to deteriorate.

But we don't have fossil remains of everything that lived in the past, and sometimes we only have fragments from one or a few individuals. So the fossil record is very incomplete. For example, Robert Martin estimates that the earth has probably seen 6,000 primate species; remains of only 3 percent of those species have been found. It is hardly surprising that primate paleontologists cannot identify most of the evolutionary connections between early and later forms. The task is particularly difficult with small mammals, such as the early primates, which are less likely than large animals to be preserved in the fossil record.34

#### Features

**Features** are kinds of artifacts, but archaeologists distinguish them from other artifacts because they cannot be easily removed from an archaeological site. Hearths are good examples. When humans build a fire on bare ground, the soil becomes heated and is changed—all the water is driven out of it and its crystalline structure is broken down and reformed. When archaeologists find a hearth, what exactly is found? An area of hard, reddish, even slightly magnetic soil, often surrounded by charcoal and ash. Here, then, is an artifact—an object of human manufacture. But it would be very hard, if not impossible, for archaeologists to take the hearth back to the lab for study like a lithic or ceramic. A hearth is really an intrinsic feature of a site—hence the name *feature.*

Hearths are common features, but the most common features by far are called *pits.* Pits are simply holes dug by humans that are later filled with garbage or eroded soil. They are usually fairly easy to distinguish because the garbage or soil they are filled with is often different in color and texture from the soil the pit was dug into. *Living floors* are another

**Lithics** The technical name for tools made from stone.

**Ecofacts** Natural items that humans have used; things such as the remains of animals eaten by humans or plant pollens found on archaeological sites are examples of ecofacts.

**Fossils** The hardened remains or impressions of plants and animals that lived in the past.

**Features** Artifacts of human manufacture that cannot be removed from an archaeological site. Hearths, storage pits, and buildings are examples of features.

common type of feature. These are the places where humans lived and worked. The soils in these locations are often compacted through human activity and are full of minute pieces of garbage—seeds, small stone flakes, beads, and the like—that became embedded in the floor. A large or very deep area of such debris is called a *midden.* Middens are often the remains of garbage dumps or areas repeatedly used over long periods of time, such as caves. Finally, *buildings* are common features on archaeological sites. These can range from the remains of stone rings that once held down the sides of tents to palaces built of stones that had been shaped and fitted together. Even the remains of wooden houses (or parts of them) have been preserved under some conditions. Features can be a diverse array of things that provide lots of information about the past.

#### Finding the Evidence of the Past

Evidence of the past is all around us, but finding it is not always easy or productive. Archaeologists and paleoanthropologists usually restrict their searches to what are called *sites.* **Sites** are known or suspected locations of past human activity that contain a record of that activity. Sites can be small, such as places where humans camped for perhaps only one night, or as large as ancient cities.

Sites are created when the remnants of human activity are covered or buried by some natural process. The most dramatic process is volcanic activity. The most impressive example of this must be Pompeii, an entire city that was buried in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in a.d. 79. Today, archaeologists are digging out the city and finding the remains of ancient life just as it was left in the moments before the eruption.35 Less dramatic processes are the natural processes of dirt accumulation and erosion. Windor water-borne soil and debris can cover a site either quickly (as in a flood) or over a long period of time, preserving intact the artifacts, ecofacts, fossils, and features left by humans. Finally, the processes through which soils are built up can also bury artifacts, ecofacts, fossils, and features in a way that allows archaeologists to uncover them later. In forests, for example, falling leaves cover the locations where humans camped. Over time, the leaves decay and build up soil, covering the remains of the human encampment slowly but completely over many years.

Because humans often reuse good locations to live and work in, many sites contain the remains of numerous human occupations. The most valuable sites to archaeologists and paleoanthropologists are those in which the burial processes worked quickly enough that each use of the site is clearly separated from the previous one. Such sites are called **stratified**; each layer, or *stratum,* of human occupation is separate, like a layer in a layer cake. Not only do stratified sites allow archaeologists or paleoanthropologists to distinguish the sequence of site occupations, but the strata themselves provide a way to know the relative ages of the occupations—earlier occupations will always be below later ones.

There is no single method of finding sites, and indeed many sites are found by happenstance. But when archaeologists and paleoanthropologists want to go out and find sites, they typically employ one of two basic methods: pedestrian survey and remote sensing. *Pedestrian survey* is what the name suggests—walking around and looking for sites. But archaeologists and paleoanthropologists can use sampling and systematic surveying methods to reduce the area to be covered on foot. *Remote sensing* techniques allow archaeologists and paleoanthropologists to find archaeological deposits from a remote location, usually the current surface of the ground beneath which the archaeological deposits are buried. Most remote sensing techniques are borrowed from exploration geology and are the same ones geologists use to find mineral or oil deposits. They typically involve the measurement of minute variations in phenomena like the earth's magnetic or gravitational field, or changes in an electric current or pulse of energy directed into the ground. When these subtle changes, called *anomalies,* are located, more detailed exploration can be done to map the extent and depth of the buried archaeological deposits.

Whether they are identified by pedestrian survey or remote sensing, there is only one way to recover archaeological deposits once they are found them—by *excavation.* **Excavation** itself is a complex process with two goals: (1) to find every scrap of evidence (or a statistically representative sample) about the past that a given site holds and (2) to record the horizontal and vertical location of that evidence with precision. Archaeologists and paleoanthropologists have developed many excavation strategies and techniques to accomplish these goals, but all of them involve the careful removal of the archaeological deposits; the recovery of artifacts, ecofacts, fossils, and features from the soil in which those deposits have been buried; and the detailed recording of where each artifact, ecofact, fossil, and feature was located on the site.

To date, no one has figured out a way to recover artifacts, ecofacts, fossils, and features from a site without destroying the site in the process, and this is one of the strange ironies of archaeological research. As we discuss shortly, the relationships between and among artifacts, ecofacts, fossils, and features are of most interest to archaeologists, and precisely these relationships are destroyed when archaeologists remove them from a site. For this reason, most excavation by professional archaeologists today is done only when a site is threatened with destruction, and then only by highly trained personnel using rigorous techniques. Archaeologists and paleoanthropologists collect data in basically the same ways, with one important difference. Archaeologists are most concerned with recovering intact features, whereas paleoanthropologists are most concerned with recovering intact fossils. This leads to some differences in approaches to collecting data, particularly where to look. So archaeologists tend to seek out undisturbed sites where intact features can be found. In contrast, disturbances are a plus for paleoanthropologists, because disturbed sites may make finding fossils easier—they may be eroding out of the surface of the ground and be easily visible without digging. This doesn't mean archaeologists never excavate disturbed sites, because they do. And paleoanthropologists have sometimes made important discoveries by excavating undisturbed sites.<sup>36</sup>

### **Perspectives on Gender**

Lefold

#### Women in the Shell Mound Archaic

ow we can learn about and understand gender roles in prehistoric cultures? How is gender preserved in the archaeological record? Information about gender roles can be recovered if one is aware of how particular kinds of material culture are associated ethnographically with particular gender roles and with changes in them over time. Archaeologists argue that such an awareness leads not only to a better understanding of gender in prehistory but can also lead to a fuller understanding of prehistoric cultures overall.

An example is Cheryl Claassen's work on the Shell Mound Archaic culture of the Tennessee River Valley. The Shell Mound Archaic peoples were hunter and gatherers who lived between about 5,500 and 3,000 years ago. The most distinctive feature of the Shell Mound Archaic is the large mounds of mollusk shells they constructed for burying their dead. Tens of thousands of shells were piled together to create these mounds. Yet, around 3,000 years ago, shellfishing and thus the creation of shell burial mounds stopped abruptly. Claassen wondered why.

Suggested explanations include climate change, overexploitation of shellfish, and the migration of shellfishing peoples from the area. None has proven wholly satisfactory. In contemporary cultures, women and children typically do the shellfishing, and Claassen decided to approach the problem through the perspective of women's workloads. The end of shellfishing would have meant that women would have had a lot of free time—free time that could have been put to use in some other way. Did some other activities become more important, so that women's labor was needed more for those other tasks?

![](_page_19_Picture_7.jpeg)

Artist's interpretation of a Shell Mound Archaic camp.

Women's labor might have been redirected toward domesticated crops. There is archaeological evidence that about 3,000 years ago several productive crops that required intensive labor came into wide use. Women were likely the ones burdened with such work. They not only would have harvested these crops but also would have been the ones to process and prepare meals from them. Thus, the emergence of agricultural economies would have required women to undertake new labor in food production and processing that may well have forced them to stop engaging in other tasks, like shellfishing, especially if the new tasks produced a larger food supply.

The development of agricultural activities might also have brought about changes in ritual and ceremonialism. The shell burial mounds

were clearly central to Shell Mound Archaic death ceremonies. Later societies in the region buried their dead in earthen mounds. Could this be a reflection of the new importance dirt had in an emerging agricultural economy? If so, what role did women play in ceremonies of death and burial? If they were no longer the providers of the raw materials needed for burial, does that mean their status in society as a whole changed?

We may never know exactly why the Shell Mound Archaic disappeared or how women's work and women's roles in society changed. But as Claassen points out, taking a gender perspective provides new avenues along which to pursue answers to these questions as well as interesting new questions to pursue.

Context The relationships between and among artifacts, ecofacts, fossils, and features

separate from one another. Nothing could be farther from the truth. In fact, putting these materials in context with one another is really what archaeology and paleoanthropology are all about. **Context** is how and why the artifacts and other materials are related. Artifacts, ecofacts, fossils, and features in isolation may be beautiful or interesting by

themselves, but only when they are placed in context with the other materials found on a site are we able to "read" and tell the story of the past.

To illustrate this point, let's consider a set of letters that were found separately: A E G I M N N. They are arranged here in alphabetical order, the way a set of beautiful artifacts might be arranged in a museum display in order of size. Do these arrangements tell us anything? No. What if we knew something about the relationships between and among these letters—their context? What if, for example, we knew that the *M* was the first letter found, and that the *A* and *E* were found next to the *M,* but in reverse order, that one *N* was found between the *E* and *I,* and that the other *N* was found between the *I* and the *G?* Knowing in what context the letters were found would tell us that the letters should be arranged like this: *M E A N I N G.* And meaning is exactly what context gives to artifacts, ecofacts, fossils, and features.

#### Dating the Evidence from the Past

An important, indeed vital, part of putting artifacts and other materials into context is putting them in chronological order. To reconstruct the evolutionary history of the primates, for example, one must know how old primate fossils are. For some time, relative dating methods were the only methods available. The last half century has seen important advances in absolute dating, including techniques that allow the dating of the earliest phases of primate evolution. **Relative dating** is used to determine the age of a specimen or deposit relative to another specimen or deposit. **Absolute dating**, or **chronometric dating**, is used to measure how old a specimen or deposit is in years.

Relative Dating Methods The earliest, and still the most commonly used, method of relative dating is based on **stratigraphy**, the study of how different rock or soil formations are laid down in successive layers or strata (see Figure 2.1). Older layers are generally deeper or lower than more recent layers. Indicator artifacts or ecofacts are used to establish a stratigraphic sequence for the relative dating of new finds. These **indicator artifacts or ecofacts** are items of human manufacture or remains from animals and plants that spread widely over short periods of time, or that disappeared or changed fairly rapidly. Different artifacts and ecofacts are used as indicators of relative age in different areas of the world. In Africa, elephants, pigs, and horses have been particularly important in establishing stratigraphic sequences. Figure 2.1 shows the stratigraphy of Olduvai Gorge, an important site where early human fossils have been found. The stratigraphy here was established in part on the basis of fossil pigs.37 The various species of pig in the successive strata are different, allowing archaeologists or paleoanthropologists to differentiate the strata based on the species found within them. Once the stratigraphy of an area is established, the relative ages of two different fossils, or features, in the same or different sites are indicated by the associated indicator artifacts or ecofacts. Major transitions in indicator artifacts or ecofacts define the epochs and larger units of geologic time. The dates of the boundaries between such units are estimated by absolute dating, described in the next section.

If a site has been disturbed, stratigraphy will not be a satisfactory way to determine relative age. As noted earlier, remains from different periods may be washed or blown together by water or wind. Or a landslide may superimpose an earlier layer on a later layer. Still, it may be possible using absolute, or chronometric, dating methods to estimate the relative age of the different fossils found together in a disturbed site.

Absolute, or Chronometric, Dating Methods Many of the absolute dating methods are based on the decay of a radioactive isotope. Because the rate of decay is known, the age of the specimen can be estimated, within a range of possible error. **Radiocarbon**, or **carbon-14 (**<sup>14</sup>**C)**, **dating** is perhaps the most popularly known method of determining the absolute age of a specimen. It is based on the principle that all living matter possesses a certain amount of a radioactive form of carbon (carbon-14, or 14C). Radioactive carbon, produced when nitrogen-14 is bombarded by cosmic rays, is absorbed from the air by plants and then ingested by animals that

#### Figure 2.1Stratigraphy of Beds I-IV along Olduvai Main Gorge

Notice how complex the four stratigraphic layers are—each has numerous layers of soil and rock within them. Index fossils, particularly pigs, along with a series of potassium-argon dates, allowed the researchers to identify the four major strata of the site, which correspond to four major periods of human occupation.

eat the plants (see Figure 2.2). After an organism dies, it no longer takes in any of the radioactive carbon. Carbon-14 decays at a slow but steady pace and reverts to nitrogen-14. (By *decays,* we mean that the 14C gives off a certain number of beta radiations per minute.) The rate at which the carbon decays—its **half-life**—is known: 14C has a half-life of 5,730 years. In other words, half of the original amount of 14C in organic matter will have disintegrated 5,730 years after the organism's death; half of the remaining 14C will have disintegrated after another 5,730 years; and so on. After about 50,000 years, the amount of 14C remaining in the organic matter is too small to permit reliable dating.

To discover how long an organism has been dead—that is, to determine how much 14C is left in the organism and therefore how old it is—we either count the number of beta radiations given off per minute per gram of material or use a particle accelerator to measure the actual amount of 14C in a sample. Modern 14C emits about 15 beta radiations per minute per gram of material, but 14C that is 5,730 years old emits only half that amount (the half-life of 14C) per minute per gram. So, if a sample of some organ-

![](_page_22_Figure_3.jpeg)

Figure 2.2 The Carbon-14 Cycle

*Source*: Taylor and Aitken 1997.

ism gives off 7.5 radiations a minute per gram, which is only half the amount given off by modern 14C, the organism must be 5,730 years old. Similarly, because the amount of 14C in a sample slowly declines over time, the atoms in a sample can be sent through a particle accelerator to separate them by weight (the lighter 12C accelerates faster than the heavier 14C) and measure the actual amount of each. This method, called accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), is more accurate than the beta radiation method, requires only a very small sample of material, and provides a way to date specimens that are up to 80,000 years old.38

Another very common absolute dating technique based on radioactive decay uses potassium-40 (40K), a radioactive form of potassium that decays at an established rate and forms argon-40 (40Ar). The half-life of 40K is a known quantity, so the age of a material containing potassium can be measured by the amount of 40K compared with the amount of 40Ar it contains.39 Radioactive potassium's (40K's) half-life is very long—1,330 million years. This means that **potassium-argon (K-Ar) dating** may be used to date samples from 5,000 years up to 3 billion years old.

The K-Ar method is used to date potassium-rich minerals in rock, not the fossils that may be found in the rock. A very high temperature, such as occurs in a volcanic event, drives off any original argon in the material. The amount of argon that accumulates afterward from the decay of radioactive potassium is directly related to the amount of time since the volcanic event. This type of dating has been extremely useful in East Africa, where volcanic events have occurred frequently since the Miocene, which began 24 million years ago. If the material to be dated is not rich in potassium, or the area did not experience any high-temperature events, other methods of absolute dating are required.

**Half-life** The time it

takes for half of the atoms of a radioactive substance to decay into atoms of a different substance.

#### **Potassium-argon**

**(K-Ar) dating** A chronometric dating method that uses the rate of decay of a radioactive form of potassium (40K) into argon ( 40Ar) to date samples from 5,000 years to 3 billion years old. The K-Ar method dates the minerals and rocks in a deposit, not the fossils themselves.

2.6 Describe the ethical requirements of anthropological research.

One problem with the K-Ar method is that the amounts of potassium and argon must be measured on different rock samples; researchers must assume that the potassium and argon are evenly distributed in all the rock samples from a particular stratum. Researchers got around this problem by developing the 40**Ar-**<sup>39</sup>**Ar dating** method. After measuring the amount of 40Ar, a nuclear reactor is used to convert another kind of argon, 39Ar, to potassium so that the potassium-argon ratio can be measured from the same sample.40

There are many other methods of absolute dating; indeed, new methods are being developed all the time.

### Ethics in Anthropological Research

Anthropologists have many ethical obligations—to the people they study, to their anthropological colleagues, to the public and the world community, and even to their employers and their own and host countries. But anthropologists agree that, should a conflict arise in ethical obligations, the most important obligation is to protect the interests of the people they study. According to the profession's code of ethics, anthropologists should tell people in the field site (or, if they are archaeologists, people who are direct descendants of the prehistoric people they are studying) about the research, and they should respect the right of people to remain anonymous if they so choose.41 For this reason, informants are often

![](_page_23_Picture_5.jpeg)

Archaeologists must be aware of the effects of their work on descendant communities. Many people, for example, find the excavation of ancestor's remains to be offensive.

given pseudonyms, or fake names; many anthropologists have extended this principle to using a fake name for the community as well. But the decision to create a fake name for a community is questionable in many circumstances.<sup>42</sup> First, anthropologists "stick out," and it is not hard for anyone interested to figure out where they lived and worked. Governments may have to be asked for research clearance, which means that they know where the anthropologist is going to do the fieldwork. Second, people who are studied are often proud of their place and their customs, and they may be insulted if their community is called something else. Third, important geographic information is often vital to understanding the community. You have to reveal if it is located at the confluence of two major rivers or if it is the trading center of the region. Lastly, it may be difficult for future anthropologists to conduct follow-up studies if the community is disguised. Of course, if a community were truly in danger, there would be no question that an anthropologist has an obligation to try to protect it.

Honest, objective reporting is also an obligation to the anthropological profession, to the public at large, and to the observed community. But suppose a custom or trait that the community views as reasonable is considered objectionable by outsiders? Such customs could range from acts that outsiders consider criminal, such as infanticide, to those that are considered repugnant, such as eating dogs. Archaeologists have caused outrage by presenting evidence of cannibalism in ancient populations.43 An anthropologist may believe that publication of the information could bring harm to the population. Kim Hill and Magdalena Hurtado faced this situation when they realized that infanticide rates were high in the group they studied in South America. They did not want to play up their findings, nor did they want to dissimulate. After they met with community leaders to discuss the situation, they agreed not to publish their findings in Spanish to

minimize the possibility that the local media or neighboring groups might learn of their findings.<sup>44</sup>

Everyday decisions like how to compensate people for their time are not easy either. Nowadays, many if not most informants expect to be paid or receive gifts. But in the early days of anthropology, in places where money was not an important part of the native economy, the decision to pay people was not a clear ethical choice. If money is rare, paying people increases the importance of money in that economy. Even nonmonetary gifts can increase inequalities or create jealousies. On the other hand, doing nothing by way of compensation doesn't seem right either. As an alternative, some anthropologists try to find some community project that they can help with—that way, everyone benefits. This is not to say that the anthropologists are necessarily a burden on the community. People often like to talk about their customs, and they may want others to appreciate their way of life. And anthropologists are often amusing. They may ask "funny" questions, and when they try to say or do customary things, they often do them all wrong. Probably every anthropologist has been laughed at sometimes in the field.

Archaeologists must always be concerned with the ethics of their work when undertaking or reporting the results of their research. Archaeology does not simply describe past cultures; it can also have a profound effect on living peoples. For example, many people find the idea of archaeologists excavating, cleaning, and preserving the remains of ancestors to be offensive. Therefore, archaeologists must be sensitive to the desires and beliefs of the populations that descend from the ones they are researching. In addition, artifacts from some ancient cultures are in great demand by art and antiquities collectors, and archaeological finds can lead to uncontrolled looting if archaeologists are not careful about how and to whom they report their discoveries. Wholesale ransacking of ancient cemeteries in some parts of China, for example, started because new archaeological discoveries led Chinese antiquities to become increasingly popular among collectors and hence increasingly valuable to those able to discover them.45

Although it is the ethical responsibility of archaeologists to consult with descendant populations and to be careful about how archaeological finds are reported, it is also an ethical responsibility of archaeologists to present the results of their work to the general public. Publishing archaeological results increases public awareness about the past and the importance of historic preservation. If people know how much can be learned from the archaeological record, they may be less likely to destroy it or to support those who destroy it for personal gain. Of course, when archaeologists excavate sites, they also destroy some of the context of the artifacts, ecofacts, fossils, and features found in the sites. But if they leave some of the sites unexcavated, they are preserving them (at least partially) for future investigation. To offset their partial destruction, archaeologists are ethically obligated to publish the results of their work. Reporting the results of archaeological research, therefore, plays a central role in both archaeological research and archaeological ethics.

**40Ar-39Ar dating** Used in conjunction with potassium-argon dating, this method gets around the problem of needing different rock samples to estimate potassium and argon. A nuclear reactor is used to convert the 39Ar to 39K, on the basis of which the amount of 40K can be estimated. In this way, both argon and potassium can be estimated from the same rock sample.

# Summary and Review

#### Explanations

2.1 Define *explanation* and *theory,* and discuss their role in anthropology.

- • Scientists try to achieve two kinds of explanations associations (observed relationships between two or more variables) and theories (explanations of associations).
- • A theory is more complicated than an association. Some concepts or implications in a theory are unobservable; an association is based entirely on observations.
- • Theories can never be proved with absolute certainty. There is always the possibility that some implication, some derivable hypothesis, will not be confirmed by future research.

• A theory may be rejectable through the method of falsification. Scientists derive predictions that should be true if the theory is correct. If the predictions turn out to be incorrect, scientists are obliged to conclude that something may be wrong with the theory.

> How do associations and theory differ as explanations?

### Brief History of Theoretical Approaches

2.2 Describe some of the main theoretical approaches in anthropology.

- • The prevailing evolutionary theory during the 19th century was based on a belief that culture generally evolves in a uniform and progressive manner.
- • During the early 20th century, the leading opponent of early evolutionism was Franz Boas, whose historical particularism rejected the idea that universal laws governed all human culture. Boas championed collecting as much data as possible, from which laws would supposedly emerge.
- • Later in the 20th century, the idea of cultural ecology, the analysis of interactions between a culture and its environment, began a debate about whether biological ecology should be separated from cultural ecology. Cultural ecologists ask how a particular culture trait may be adaptive in its environment.
- • Today anthropologists who refer to themselves as evolutionary or behavioral ecologists explore how particular characteristics may be adaptive for an individual in a given environment (cultural ecologists tend to focus on the group or culture more than the individual). However, dual-inheritance theory, gives much more weight to culture as part of the evolutionary process. Dual inheritance refers to both genes and culture playing different but nonetheless important and interactive roles in transmitting traits to future generations.
- • Influenced by literary criticism, a variety of "interpretive" approaches developed beginning in the 1960s. For many interpretive anthropologists, the goal of anthropology is to understand what it means to be a person living in a particular culture, rather than to explain why cultures vary. The task of understanding meaning, these scholars claim, cannot be achieved scientifically.
- • Scientific anthropologists do not agree that explanation is not achievable and have developed many techniques for minimizing bias and increasing the objectivity of measurement.

What are some examples of different theoretical approaches in anthropology?

### Evidence: Testing Explanations

2.3 Explain the process of operationalization, the importance of measurement, and the value of statistical evaluation in testing explanations.

- • A theory needs to be tested to determine whether it is likely to be correct. A general strategy is to predict what one would expect to find if a particular theory were correct and then to conduct an investigation to see whether the prediction is generally consistent with the data.
- • A satisfactory test specifies operationally how to measure the variables involved in the relationships that are expected to exist so other researchers can try to replicate, or repeat, the results.
- • Tests of predictions should use samples that are unbiased and representative of the whole. The most objective way to obtain a representative sample is to select the sample cases randomly, but sometimes anthropologists must depend on a sample that is not random.
- • The results of tests are evaluated by statistical methods that assign probability values to the results. These values make it possible to distinguish between probably true and probably accidental results.

What are the main steps in testing explanations?

### Types of Research in Anthropology

2.4 Differentiate the types of research in anthropology.

- • The types of research in anthropology can be classified according to two criteria: (1) the spatial scope of the study and (2) the temporal scope of the study.
- • In cultural anthropology, the basic research methods within the two main criteria are (a) ethnographic fieldwork and ethnohistory, (b) historical and nonhistorical regional controlled comparisons, and (c) historical and nonhistorical cross-cultural research.

What are the main types of research in anthropology?

### Studying the Distant Past

2.5 Describe the four types of evidence that archaeologists and paleoanthropologists find and how they analyze it.

- • Three goals of archaeology are (1) to understand a culture's history, (2) to test specific explanations about human evolution and behavior, and (3) to identify and understand general trends and patterns in human biological and cultural evolution.
- • Archaeologists and paleoanthropologists collect four basic types of evidence about the past: artifacts, ecofacts, fossils, and features. Artifacts are any objects made by humans. Ecofacts are natural objects that humans use or modify. Fossils are the preserved remains of ancient plants and animals. Features are artifacts that cannot be removed from archaeological sites.
- • Archaeological sites are locations where the evidence of the past has been preserved. Sites are found through pedestrian survey or remote sensing, and artifacts, ecofacts, fossils, and features are recovered from sites through excavation.
- • A key part of any archaeological survey or excavation is the preservation of context—the relationships between and among artifacts, ecofacts, fossils, and features.
- • Accurate techniques for dating archaeological material contribute significantly to determining context. Relative dating techniques determine the age of archaeological materials relative to other materials of known ages. Absolute dating techniques determine the age of the archaeological deposits or materials themselves.

### Ethics in Anthropological Research

2.6 Describe the ethical requirements of anthropological research.

- • Anthropologists must inform the people they are studying (or the descendants of those people) about their work and its purpose.
- • Anthropologists must ensure that their work does no harm and that the confidentiality of people they study is protected. They must be particularly careful to identify appropriate and nondisruptive ways to compensate groups who participate in studies.
- • Archaeologists must present the results of their work to the general public. Publishing archaeological results increases public awareness about the past and the importance of historic preservation.
