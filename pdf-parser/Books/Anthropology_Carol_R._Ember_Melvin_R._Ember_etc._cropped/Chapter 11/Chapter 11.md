Civilization Urban society, from the Latin word for "city-state."

**State** An autonomous political unit with centralized decision making over many communities with power to govern by force (e.g., to collect taxes, draft people for work and war, and make and enforce laws). Most states have cities with public buildings; full-time craft and religious specialists; an "official" art style; a hierarchical social structure topped by an elite class; and a governmental monopoly on the legitimate use of force to implement policies.

rom the time agriculture first developed until about 6000 B.C., people in the Near  $\mathbf{C}$  East lived in fairly small villages. There were few differences in wealth and status from household to household, and apparently there was no governmental authority beyond the village. There is also no evidence that these villages had any public buildings or craft specialists or that one community was very different in size from its neighbors. In short, these settlements had none of the characteristics we commonly associate with "civilization."

But sometime around 6000 B.C., in parts of the Near East—and at later times in other places—a great transformation in the quality and scale of human life seems to have begun. For the first time, we can see evidence of differences in status among households. For example, some are much bigger than others. Communities begin to differ in size and to specialize in certain crafts. And there are signs that some political officials had acquired authority over several communities—that what anthropologists call "chiefdoms" had emerged.

Somewhat later, by about 3500 B.C., we can see many, if not all, of the conventional characteristics of **civilization**: the first inscriptions, or writing; cities; many kinds of full-time craft specialists; monumental architecture; great differences in wealth and status; and the kind of strong, hierarchical, centralized political system we call the state (see Figure 11.1).

This type of transformation has occurred many times and in many places in human history. The most ancient civilizations arose in the Near East around 3500 B.C., in northwestern India and in Peru about 2500 B.C., in northern China around 1750 B.C., in Mexico a few hundred years before the time of Christ, and in tropical Africa somewhat later.<sup>1</sup> At least some of these civilizations evolved independently of the others—for example, those in the New World and those in the Old World. Why did they do so?

What conditions favored the emergence of centralized, state-like political systems? What conditions favored the establishment of cities? We ask this last question separately because archaeologists are not yet certain that all the ancient state societies had cities when they first developed centralized government. In this chapter, we discuss some of the things archaeologists have learned or suspect about the growth of ancient civilizations. Our discussion focuses primarily on the Near East and Mexico because archaeologists know the most about the sequences of cultural development in those two areas.

## Archaeological Inferences About Civilization

Archaeologists rather than historians have studied the most ancient civilizations because those civilizations evolved before the advent of writing. How do archaeologists infer that a particular people in the preliterate past had social classes, cities, or a centralized government?

It appears that the earliest Neolithic societies were *egalitarian;* that is, people did not differ much in wealth, prestige, or power. Some later societies show signs of social inequality, indicated by burial finds. Archaeologists generally assume that inequality in death reflects inequality in life, at least in status and perhaps also in wealth and power. Thus, we can be fairly sure that a society had differences in status if only some people were buried with special objects, such as jewelry or pots filled with food. And we can be fairly sure that high status was assigned at birth rather than achieved in later life if we find noticeable differences in children's tombs. For example, some (but not all) child burials from as early as 5500 b.c. to 5000 b.c. at Tell es-Sawwan in Iraq, and from about 800 b.c. at La Venta in Mexico, are filled with statues and ornaments, suggesting that some children had high status from birth.<sup>2</sup> But burials indicating differences in status do not necessarily mean a society had significant differences in wealth. Only when archaeologists find other substantial differences, as in house size and furnishings, can we be sure the society had different socioeconomic classes of people.

Some archaeologists think that states first evolved around 3500 b.c. in greater Mesopotamia, the area now shared by southern Iraq and southwestern Iran. Archaeologists do not always agree on how a state should be defined, but most think that hierarchical and centralized decision making affecting a substantial population is the key criterion. Other characteristics are usually, but not always, found in these first states. They usually have cities with a substantial part of the population not involved directly in the collection or production of food (which means that people in cities are heavily dependent on people elsewhere); full-time religious

and craft specialists; public buildings; and often an official art style. There is a hierarchical social structure topped by an elite class from which the leaders are drawn. The government tries to claim a monopoly on the use of force. (Our own state society says that citizens do not have the right "to take the law into their own hands.") The state uses its force or threat of force to tax its population and to draft people for work or war (see the box "Imperialism, Colonialism, and the State").3

How can archaeologists tell, from the information provided by material remains, whether a society was a state or not? This depends in part on what is used as the criterion for a state. For example, Henry Wright and Gregory Johnson defined a state as a centralized political hierarchy with at least three levels of administration.4 But how might archaeologists infer that such a hierarchy existed in some area? Wright and Johnson suggested that the way settlement sites differ in size is one indication of how many levels of administration there were in an area.

During the early Uruk period (just before 3500 b.c.), in what is now southwestern Iran, there were some 50 settlements that seem to fall into three groups in terms of size.<sup>5</sup> There were about 45 small villages, three or four "towns," and one large center, Susa. These three types of settlements seem to have been part of a three-level

## Migrants and Immigrants

#### Imperialism, Colonialism, and the State

J ust like the British and French, who first came to North America to explore and trade and often used force to protect their settlements and access to trade items, Uruk citystates seem also to have dominated their peripheral, less developed trading "partners." For example, before 3000 b.c. there were fortified towns with Uruk-style pottery and administrative artifacts at river junctions in the north of Mesopotamia. Why did the Uruk people go there? One possibility is that they deliberately built outposts to secure their access to needed trade goods, including hides and dried meat.

The various Uruk period polities of the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys seem to have been intensely competitive. The walls around the cities indicate that they were probably subject to attack by their rivals at any time. The picture is reminiscent of the Greek city-states described by Thucydides. It is also like the picture we get from the hieroglyphic writings of the Mayan city-states in and around southern Mexico (a.d. 300 to a.d. 800), which, in a mixture of history and propaganda, extol the triumphs of the various rival rulers. And, of course, we are all familiar with how Britain and Spain and Holland and France were rivals before and after the New World was discovered.

But what about the Uruk city-states? Why should we think they too were imperialistic colonizers? Archaeologist Guillermo Algaze reviewed the evidence. First, there was the colonization of the plains of southwestern Iran, which people could get to from southern Mesopotamia in 7 to 10 days by foot or donkey caravan. Then, and maybe overlapping with the expansion into southwestern Iran, the Uruk polities established outposts or took over already existing settlements to the north and northwest, on the plains of what are now northern Iraq and Syria; these latter settlements were apparently all located at intersections of the important waterways and overland routes.

According to Algaze, the Uruk enclaves and outposts outside southern Mesopotamia fit what comparative historian Philip Curtin calls a trade diaspora. Diasporas have taken various forms, but they all represent ways to organize exchange between areas with different but complementary resources. At one end of the range of possibilities—involving little or no political organization—commercial specialists remove themselves from their own society and settle as aliens somewhere else. At the other end of the range of variation—the most politically organized—the expanding polity is involved from the beginning

in the founding of outposts that secure the required trade.

Algaze thinks that the Uruk expansion was motivated by a lack of resources in southern Mesopotamia. But other areas of the world, at the time and since, have lacked resources, so what else might explain the Uruk expansion? Algaze notes that, when the Uruk settlers moved into southwestern Iran, they were entering an area that was not so densely settled, so they may have encountered only minimal resistance. Indeed, the various Uruk period enclaves and outposts outside southern Mesopotamia were apparently larger and more complex than any previous communities in the peripheral areas. Perhaps, then, imperialism and colonialism are possible only in a world of unequals.

Years ago, anthropologist Stanley Diamond argued that "imperialism and colonialism are as old as the State." Does this mean that states are likely to practice imperialism and colonialism if they can get away with it? Or are only some conditions likely to predispose states to imperialism and colonialism? Perhaps future research, particularly cross-cultural and crosshistorical research, will tell us.

administration hierarchy because many small villages could not trade with Susa without passing through a settlement intermediate in size. Because a three-level hierarchy is Wright and Johnson's criterion of a state, they think a state had emerged in the area by early Uruk times.

Evidence from the next period, middle Uruk, suggests more definitely that a state had emerged. This evidence takes the form of clay seals that were apparently used in trading.6 *Commodity sealings* were used to keep a shipment of goods tightly closed until it reached its destination, and *message sealings* were used to keep track of goods sent and received. The clay seals found in Susa include many message seals and *bullae,* clay containers that served as bills of lading for goods received. The villages, in contrast, had few message seals and bullae. Again, this finding suggests that Susa administered the regional movement of goods and that Susa was the "capital" of the state.

Let us turn now to the major features of the cultural sequences leading to the first states in southern Iraq.

## Cities and States in Southern Iraq

Farming communities older than the first states have not been found in the arid lowland plains of southern Iraq—the area known as Sumer, where some of the earliest cities and states developed (see Figure 11.2). Perhaps silt from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers has covered them. Or, as has been suggested, Sumer may not have been settled by agriculturalists until people learned how to drain and irrigate river-valley soils otherwise too wet or too dry for cultivation. At any rate, small communities depending partly on agriculture had emerged in the hilly areas north and east of Sumer early in the Neolithic. Later, by about 6000 b.c., a mixed herding and farming economy developed in those areas.

#### The Formative Era

Elman Service called the period from about 5000 b.c. to 3500 b.c. the *formative era,* for it saw the coming together of many changes that seem to have played a part in the development of cities and states. Service suggested that, with the development of smallscale irrigation, lowland river areas began to attract settlers. The rivers provided not only water for irrigation but also mollusks, fish, and waterbirds for food. And they provided

routes by which to import needed raw materials, such as hardwood and stone, that were lacking in Sumer.

Changes during this period suggest an increasingly complex social and political life. Differences in status are reflected in the burial of statues and ornaments with children. Different villages specialized in the production of different goods—pottery in some, copper and stone tools in others.7 Temples were built in certain places that may have been centers of political as well as religious authority for several communities.8 Furthermore, some anthropologists think that chiefdoms, each having authority over several villages, had developed by this time.9

#### Sumerian Civilization

By about 3500 b.c., there were quite a few cities in the area of Sumer. Most were enclosed in a fortress wall and surrounded by an agricultural area. About 3000 b.c., all of Sumer was unified under a single government. After that time, Sumer became an empire. It had great urban centers. Imposing temples, commonly set on artificial mounds, dominated the cities. In the city of Warka, the temple mound was about 150 feet high. The empire was very complex and included an elaborate system for the administration of justice, codified laws, specialized government officials, a professional standing army, and even sewer systems in the cities. Among the many specialized crafts were brickmaking, pottery, carpentry, jewelry making, leatherworking, metallurgy, basketmaking, stonecutting, and sculpture. Sumerians learned to construct and use wheeled wagons, sailboats, horse-drawn chariots, and spears, swords, and armor of bronze.11

As economic specialization developed, social stratification became more elaborate. Sumerian documents describe a system of social classes: nobles, priests, merchants, craftworkers, metallurgists, bureaucrats, soldiers, farmers, free citizens, and slaves. Slaves were common in Sumer; they often were captives, brought back as the spoils of war.

We see the first evidence of writing around 3000 b.c. The earliest Sumerian writings were in the form of ledgers containing inventories of items stored in the temples and records of livestock or other items owned or managed by the temples. Sumerian writing was wedge-shaped, or **cuneiform**, formed by pressing a stylus against a damp clay tablet. For contracts and other important documents, the tablet was fired to create a virtually permanent record. Egyptian writing, or hieroglyphics, appeared about the same time. **Hieroglyphics** were written on rolls woven from papyrus reeds, from which our word *paper* derives.

## Cities and States in Mesoamerica

Cities and states emerged in Mesoamerica—Mexico and Central America—later than they did in the Near East. The later appearance of civilization in Mesoamerica may be linked to the later emergence of agriculture in the New World and possibly to the near-absence of large animals such as cattle and horses that could be domesticated.11 We focus primarily on the developments that led to the rise of the city-state of Teotihuacán, which reached its height shortly after the time of Christ. Teotihuacán is located in a valley of the same name, which is the northeastern part of the larger Valley of Mexico.

#### The Formative Period

The formative period in the area around Teotihuacán (1000 b.c. to 300 b.c.) was characterized initially by small, scattered farming villages on the hilly slopes just south of the Teotihuacán Valley. There were probably a few hundred people in each hamlet, and each of these scattered groups was probably politically autonomous. After about 500 b.c., there seems to have been a population shift to settlements on the valley floor, probably in association with the use of irrigation. Between about 300 b.c. and 200 b.c., small "elite" centers emerged in the valley; each had an earthen or stone raised platform. Residences or small temples of poles and thatch originally stood on these platforms. That some individuals, particularly those in the elite centers, were buried in special tombs supplied with ornaments, headdresses, carved bowls, and a good deal of food indicates some social inequality.12 The various elite centers may indicate the presence of chiefdoms.

#### The City and State of Teotihuacán

About 150 years before the time of Christ, no more than a few thousand people lived in scattered villages in the Teotihuacán Valley. In a.d. 100, there was a city of 80,000. By a.d. 500, well over 100,000 people, or approximately 90 percent of the entire valley population, seem to have been drawn or coerced into Teotihuacán.13

![](_page_6_Picture_7.jpeg)

The city of Teotihuacán, which had its peak in a.d. 500, was a planned city built on a grid pattern. At the center was the Pyramid of the Sun, seen in the background on the left here.

11.3 Describe the emergence of cities and states in Mesoamerica.

The layout of the city of Teotihuacán, which shows a tremendous amount of planning, suggests that the valley was politically unified under a centralized state from its beginning. Mapping has revealed that the streets and most of the buildings are laid out in a grid pattern following a basic modular unit of over 613 square feet (57 square meters). Residential structures are often squares of this size, and many streets are spaced according to multiples of the basic unit. Even the river that ran through the center of the city was channeled to conform to the grid pattern. Perhaps the most outstanding feature of the city is the colossal scale of its architecture. Two pyramids dominate the metropolis, the socalled Pyramid of the Moon and the Pyramid of the Sun. At its base, the latter is as big as the Great Pyramid of Cheops in Egypt.

The thousands of residential structures built after a.d. 300 follow a standard pattern. Narrow streets separate the one-story buildings, each of which has high, windowless walls. Patios and shafts provide interior light. The layout of rooms suggests that each building consisted of several apartments; more than 100 people may have lived in one of these apartment compounds. There is variation from compound to compound in the size of rooms and the elaborateness of interior decoration, suggesting considerable variation in wealth.<sup>14</sup>

At the height of its power (a.d. 200 to a.d. 500), the metropolis of Teotihuacán encompassed an area larger than imperial Rome.15 Much of Mesoamerica seems to have been influenced by Teotihuacán. Archaeologically, its influence is suggested by the extensive spread of Teotihuacán-style pottery and architectural elements. Undoubtedly, large numbers of people in Teotihuacán were engaged in production for, and the conduct of, long-distance trade. Perhaps 25 percent of the city's population worked at various specialized crafts, including the manufacture of projectile points and cutting and scraping tools from volcanic obsidian. Teotihuacán was close to major deposits of obsidian, which was apparently in some demand over much of Mesoamerica. Materials found in graves indicate that there was an enormous flow of foreign goods into the city, including precious stones, feathers from colorful birds in the tropical lowlands, and cotton.16

#### The City of Monte Albán

Teotihuacán probably was not the earliest city-state in Mesoamerica. There is evidence of political unification somewhat earlier, about 500 b.c., in the Valley of Oaxaca, in southern Mexico, with the city of Monte Albán at its center. Monte Albán presents an interesting contrast to Teotihuacán. Whereas Teotihuacán seems to have completely dominated its valley, containing almost all its inhabitants and craftspeople, Monte Albán did not. The various villages in the Valley of Oaxaca seem to have specialized in different crafts, and Monte Albán did not monopolize craft production. After the political unification of the valley, cities and towns other than Monte Albán remained important; the population of Monte Albán grew only to 30,000 or so. Unlike Teotihuacán, Monte Albán was not an important commercial or market center, it was not laid out in a grid pattern, and its architecture was not much different from that of other settlements in the valley.17

Monte Albán did not have the kinds of resources that Teotihuacán had. It was located on top of a mountain in the center of the valley, far from either good soil or permanent water supplies that could have been used for irrigation. Even finding drinking water must have been difficult. No natural resources for trade were nearby, nor is there much evidence that Monte Albán was used as a ceremonial center. Because the city was at the top of a steep mountain, it is unlikely that it could have been a central marketplace for valleywide trade.

Why, then, did Monte Albán rise to become one of the early centers of Mesoamerican civilization? Richard Blanton suggested it may have originally been founded in the late formative period (500 b.c. to 400 b.c.) as a neutral place where representatives of the different political units in the valley could reside to coordinate activities affecting the whole valley. Thus, Monte Albán may have been like the cities of Brasília, Washington, DC, and Athens, all of which were originally founded in "neutral," nonproductive areas. Such a center, lacking obvious resources, would not, at least initially, threaten the various political units around it. Later it might become a metropolis dominating a more politically unified region, as Monte Albán came to do in the Valley of Oaxaca.18

#### Other Centers of Mesoamerican Civilization

In addition to Teotihuacán and Oaxaca, there were other Mesoamerican state societies that developed somewhat later. For example, there are a number of centers with monumental architecture, presumably built by speakers of Mayan languages, in the highlands and lowlands of modern-day Guatemala and the Yucatán Peninsula of modern-day Mexico. On the basis of surface appearances, the Mayan centers do not appear to have been as densely populated as Teotihuacán or Monte Albán. But it is now evident that the Mayan centers were more densely populated and more dependent on intensive agriculture than was once thought,19 and recent translations of Mayan picture writing indicate a much more developed form of writing than previously thought.20 It is apparent now that Mayan urbanization and cultural complexity were underestimated because of the dense tropical forest that now covers much of the area of Mayan civilization.

## The First Cities and States in Other Areas

So far, we have discussed the emergence of cities and states in southern Iraq and Mesoamerica whose development is best, if only imperfectly, known archaeologically. But other state societies probably arose more or less independently in many other areas of the world as well (see Figure 11.2). We say "independently" because such states seem to have emerged without colonization or conquest by other states.

Almost at the same time as the Sumerian empire, the great dynastic age was beginning in the Nile Valley in Egypt. The Old Kingdom, or early dynastic period, began about 3100 b.c., with a capital at Memphis. The archaeological evidence from the early centuries is limited, but most of the population appears to have lived in largely self-sufficient villages. Many of the great pyramids and palaces were built around 2500 b.c. 21

Artist's reconstruction of the ancient city of Harappa. Despite large public works like this water control system, there was little display of grandeur at Harappa. Unlike many other ancient civilizations, all Harappan cities were laid out according to the same basic plan.

Elsewhere in Africa, states also arose. In what is present-day Ethiopia, the Axum (or Aksum) state evolved beginning sometime early in the first millennium a.d. and ultimately became a center of trade and commerce between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Among the unique accomplishments of the Axum state were multistory stone residences built in a singular architectural style. Axum is also notable as being perhaps the first officially Christian state in the world.<sup>22</sup>

In sub-Saharan Africa, by a.d. 800, the savanna and forest zones of western Africa had a succession of city-states. One of them was called Ghana, and it became a major source of gold for the Mediterranean world (as did other states in what came to be known as the "Gold Coast"). In the Congo River basin, a powerful kingdom had evolved by a.d. 1200, with cities described as having tens of thousands of residences and a king that was recognized as an equal by the Portuguese king in the early 1500s.23 Farther south, states apparently arose in several areas early in the second millennium a.d. One of these was responsible for the large, circular stone structures known today as the Great Zimbabwe.24

In the Indus Valley of northwestern India, a large state society had developed by 2300 b.c. This Harappan civilization did not have much in the way of monumental architecture, such as pyramids and palaces, and it was also unusual in other respects. The state apparently controlled an enormous territory—over a million square kilometers. There was not just one major city but many, each built according to a similar pattern and with a municipal water and sewage system.25

The Shang dynasty in northern China (1750 b.c.) has long been cited as the earliest state society in the Far East. But recent research suggests that an even earlier one, the Xia dynasty, may have emerged in the same general area by 2200 b.c. In any case, the Shang dynasty had all the earmarks of statehood: a stratified, specialized society; religious, economic, and administrative unification; and a distinctive art style.<sup>26</sup>

In South America, a group of distinct state societies may have emerged as early as 2500 b.c. in the Supe and Pativilca valleys north of Lima, Peru. The valley contains a group of large cities that seem to have been interdependent—cities on the coast

## Current Research and Issues

#### Was Cahokia a State?

ahokia was the largest community to develop in the pre-Columbian Americas north of Mexico, but scholars are not sure if it was a complex chiefdom or a simple state. What factors suggest a state? Factors suggesting that it was a state include its size—the core community covered over 13 square kilometers and included more than 100 earthen mounds. The largest of these mounds was the largest human-made construction in the Americas north of Mexico until the Empire State Building was completed in 1931. The population of Cahokia was at least 10,000 people and may have been more like 15,000. There were also elites one buried on a blanket decorated with over 20,000 shell beads and surrounded by over 100 other individuals who appear to have been sacrificed at the time of the elite individual's death. Cahokia also engaged in long-distance trade that stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes and from the Appalachians to the Black Hills. There were a number of smaller communities in the Cahokia region, and some scholars have suggested a four-level settlement hierarchy was present. Four-level hierarchies indicate the presences of states. With all this evidence suggesting a state, why is there any controversy?

So why do most scholars not think Cahokia was a state? Largely because the evidence is lacking on a number of points. There is no evidence of leaders able to control the population by force. There was no standing army, no obvious administrative bureaucracy, and no obvious administrative control over the economy. While there was an obvious elite who controlled access to prestige goods (and for whom human sacrifices may have been made upon their deaths), it is not clear that these elites had political power over the entire society or controlled an all-encompassing bureaucracy. The settlement hierarchy, too, may have been informal, rather than administrative, and trade may have been carried out by individuals without any government regulation. In short, most scholars think that while Cahokia was clearly a complex social and economic entity, it was not a true state.

Regardless of whether Cahokia was actually a state or not, Cahokia demonstrates the difficulty of interpreting political and economic organization from the archaeological record.

supplied inland cities with fish, whereas inland cities served as political and economic centers. The cities contain plaza areas and large pyramids, which are thought to be temple structures.<sup>27</sup> After 200 B.C. the major river valleys leading from the Andes to the sea witnessed the development of a complex agricultural system dependent on irrigation. The separate, but similar, states participated in a widespread system of religious symbols and beliefs called Chavín. The various states included the well-known Moche state, creators of some of the most remarkable effigy ceramics ever known, and the Nazca state, the people of which constructed a huge landscape of intaglios (inscribed images and lines) on the hard ground of highland deserts. By A.D. 700, these regional states were integrated into a large, militaristic empire called Wari (or Huari).<sup>28</sup>

And in North America, a huge settlement, with over 100 earthen mounds (one of them, Monk's Mound, is the largest pre-Columbian structure north of Mexico) and covering an area of more than 5 square miles (13 square kilometers), developed near present-day St. Louis late in the first millennium A.D. The site is called Cahokia, and it was certainly the center of a large and powerful chiefdom. Whether it had achieved a state level of organization is controversial (see the box feature "Was Cahokia a State?"). There is evidence for religious and craft specialists, and there is clear social stratification, but whether or not the leaders of Cahokian society were able to govern by force is still unclear.<sup>29</sup>

11.5 Evaluate the major theories about the origin of the state.

## Theories About the Origin of the State

We have seen that states developed in many parts of the world. Why did they evolve when and where they did? A number of theories have been proposed. We consider those that archaeologists have discussed frequently.30

#### Irrigation

Irrigation seems to have been important in many of the areas in which early state societies developed. Irrigation made the land habitable or productive in parts of Mesoamerica, southern Iraq, the Nile Valley, China, and South America. It has been suggested that the labor and management needed for the upkeep of an irrigation system led to the formation of a political elite, the overseers of the system, who eventually became the governors of the society.31 Proponents of this view believe that both the city and civilization were outgrowths of the administrative requirements of an irrigation system.

Critics note that this theory does not seem to apply to all areas where cities and states may have emerged independently. For example, in southern Iraq, the irrigation systems serving the early cities were generally small and probably did not require extensive labor and management. Large-scale irrigation works were not constructed until after cities had been fully established.32 Thus, irrigation could not have been the main stimulus for the development of cities and states in Sumer. Even in China, for which the irrigation theory was first formulated, there is no evidence of large-scale irrigation as early as Shang times.33

Although large-scale irrigation may not always have preceded the emergence of the first cities and states, even small-scale irrigation systems could have resulted in unequal access to productive land and so may have contributed to the development of a stratified society.34 In addition, irrigation systems may have given rise to border and other disputes between adjacent groups, thereby prompting people to concentrate in cities for defense and stimulating the development of military and political controls.35 Finally, as Robert Adams and Elman Service both suggested, the main significance of irrigation, either large or small scale, may have been its intensification of production, a development that in turn may have indirectly stimulated craft specialization, trade, and administrative bureaucracy.<sup>36</sup>

#### Population Growth, Circumscription, and War

Robert Carneiro has suggested that states may emerge because of population growth in an area that is physically or socially limited. Competition and warfare in such a situation may lead to the subordination of defeated groups, who are obliged to pay tribute and to submit to the control of a more powerful group.37 Carneiro illustrated his theory by describing how states may have emerged on the northern coast of Peru.

After the people of that area first settled into an agricultural village life, population grew at a slow, steady rate. Initially, new villages were formed as population grew. But in the narrow coastal valleys—blocked by high mountains, fronted by the sea, and surrounded by desert—this splintering-off process could not continue indefinitely. The result, according to Carneiro, was increasing land shortage and warfare between villages as they competed for land. Because the high mountains, the sea, and the desert blocked any escape for losers, the defeated villagers had no choice but to submit to political domination. In this way, chiefdoms may have become kingdoms as the most powerful villages grew to control entire valleys. As chiefs' power expanded over several valleys, states and empires may have been born.

Carneiro noted that physical or environmental circumscription may not be the only kind of barrier that gives rise to a state. Social circumscription may be just as important. People living at the center of a high-density area may find that their migration is blocked by surrounding settlements just as effectively as it could be by mountains, sea, and desert.

Marvin Harris suggested a somewhat different form of circumscription. He argued that the first states with their coercive authority could emerge only in areas that supported intensive grain agriculture (and the possibility of high food production) and were surrounded by areas that could not support intensive grain agriculture. So people in such areas might put up with the coercive authority of a state because they would suffer a sharp drop in living standards if they moved away.<sup>38</sup>

Carneiro suggested that his theory applies to many areas besides the northern coast of Peru, including southern Iraq and the Indus and Nile valleys. Although there were no geographic barriers in areas such as northern China or the Mayan lowlands on the Yucatán Peninsula, the development of states in those areas may have been the result of social circumscription. Carneiro's theory seems to be supported for southern Iraq, where there is archaeological evidence of population growth, circumscription, and warfare.39 There is evidence of population growth before the emergence of the state in the Teotihuacán Valley as well.40

But population growth does not necessarily mean population pressure. For example, the populations in the Teotihuacán and Oaxaca valleys apparently did increase prior to state development, but there is no evidence that they had even begun to approach the limits of their resources. More people could have lived in both places.41 Nor is population growth definitely associated with state formation in all areas where early states arose. For example, according to Wright and Johnson, there was population growth long before states emerged in southwestern Iran, but the population apparently declined just before the states emerged.<sup>42</sup>

In addition, Carneiro's circumscription theory leaves an important logical question unanswered: Why would the victors in war let the defeated populations remain and pay tribute? If the victors wanted the land so much in the first place, why wouldn't they try to exterminate the defeated and occupy the land themselves, which has happened many times in history?

#### Local and Long-Distance Trade

It has been suggested that trade was a factor in the emergence of the earliest states.43 Wright and Johnson theorized that the organizational requirements of producing items for export, redistributing the items imported, and defending trading parties would foster state formation.44 Does the archaeological evidence support such a theory?

In southern Iraq and the Mayan lowlands, long-distance trade routes may indeed have stimulated bureaucratic growth. In the lowlands of southern Iraq, as we have seen, people needed wood and stone for building, and they traded with highland people for those items. In the Mayan lowlands, the development of civilization seems to have been preceded by long-distance trade. Farmers in the lowland regions traded with faraway places to obtain salt, obsidian for cutting blades, and hard stone for grinding tools.45 In southwestern Iran, long-distance trade did not become very important until after Susa became the center of a state society, but short-distance

trade may have played the same kind of role in the formation of states.

Kwang-chih Chang put forward a similar theory for the origin of states in China. He suggested that Neolithic societies in the Yellow River Valley developed a long-distance trade network, which he called an *interaction sphere,* by about 4000 b.c. Trade spread cultural elements among the societies in the interaction sphere so that they came to share some common elements (see Figure 11.3). Over time, these societies came to depend on each other both as trade partners and as cultural partners, and around 2000 b.c. they unified into a single political unit under the Shang dynasty.46 Thus, Chang sees political unification in China as an outgrowth of a preexisting system of trade and cultural interaction.

#### The Various Theories: An Evaluation

Why do states form? As of now, no one theory seems to fit all the known situations. The reason may be that different conditions in different places may have favored the emergence of centralized government. After all, the state, by definition, implies an ability to organize large

Figure 11.3 Expansion of Regional Neolithic Cultures in China, 4000 b.c. to 3000 b.c. populations for a collective purpose. In some areas, this purpose may have been the need to organize trade with local or far-off regions. In other cases, the state may have emerged as a way to control defeated populations in circumscribed areas. In still other instances, a combination of factors may have fostered the development of the state type of political system.47

11.6 Identify and explain consequences of state formation.

## The Consequences of State Formation

We have considered several areas where states arose, as well as a number of theories to explain the origin of states. But what were the consequences for the people living in those societies? The consequences seem to have been dramatic.

One of the ways states change the lifestyles of people is by allowing for larger and denser populations.48 The presence of agriculture itself gives populations the potential to grow, and the development of a state only furthers that potential. Why? Because a state is able to build infrastructure—irrigation systems, roadways, markets—that allows both the production and distribution of agricultural products to become more efficient. States are able to coordinate information as well, and they can use that information to manage agricultural production cycles and to anticipate or manage droughts, blights, or other natural disasters. States are also able to control access to land (through laws and a military) and thus can both maintain farmers on the land and prevent others (from either within or outside of the state) from removing the farmers or interfering with their ability to produce food.

With increased efficiency of agricultural production and distribution, states also allow many (if not most) people in the society to be relieved of food production. These people are freed to become craftspeople, merchants, and artists as well as bureaucrats, soldiers, and political leaders. People may also live apart from agricultural fields, and thus cities with

dense populations can arise. Cities can also arise in locations that are not suited to agriculture but that perhaps are suited to trade (such as the cities on rivers in southern Mesopotamia) or defense (such as on top of a mountain, as in the case of Monte Albán). Art, music, and literature often flourish in such contexts, and these too are often consequences of the rise of states. Organized religion also often develops after states appear. Thus, all the hallmarks we associate with civilization can be seen as resulting from the evolution of states.49

The development of states can have many negative impacts as well. When states develop, people become governed by force and are no longer able to say "no" to their leaders. Police and military forces can become instruments of oppression and terror.50 On a less obvious level, the class stratification of states creates differences in access to resources and an underclass of poor, uneducated, and frequently unhealthy people. Health issues are exacerbated by the concentration of people in cities, an environment in which epidemic diseases can flourish.51 Without direct access to food supplies, people in cities also face the threat of malnutrition or outright starvation if food production and distribution systems fail.52

All states appear to be expansionistic, and the emergence of state warfare and conquest seems one of the most striking negative impacts of the evolution of states. In fact, more human suffering can probably be linked to state expansion than to any other single factor. Why do states expand? One basic reason may be that they are able to. States have standing armies

ready to fight or be sent to conquer enemies. Another reason for state expansion might be related to the threat of famine and disease, which is more likely with intensive agriculture.53 While the Embers have found that, in recent societies, resource unpredictability with regard to food is generally associated with a higher frequency of warfare,54 such problems are not predictive of more warfare in state societies, 55 perhaps because state societies can employ redistribution to help alleviate food shortages. And states, with standing armies, need resources to deploy troops. However, states may have other unpredictabilities with regard to access to goods from outside, and those unpredictabilites may push states fearful of shortfalls to war ahead of time as a means of gaining access to more resources (or of limiting the unpredictability of resources).56 A third answer to the question of why states tend to expand might be that belligerence is simply part of the nature of states. States often arise through military means, and it may be vital to the continuation of some states that military power be continually demonstrated.57 Regardless of the causes, war and conquest are the consequences of state formation. Often, too, defeat in war is the fate of states.

## The Decline and Collapse of States

When you look over the list of ancient states we have discussed in this chapter—Monte Albán, Teotihuacán, Sumer, pharonic Egypt—you will notice one element common to them all: Each eventually collapsed; none maintained its power and influence into historic times. Why? It is an important question because, if collapse is the ultimate fate of many if not all states, then we can anticipate that our own state is likely to collapse eventually. Perhaps knowing something about how and why other states have fallen can prevent (or at least hold off) the fall of our own.

One suggested explanation for the decline and collapse of states is environmental degradation. If states originally arose where the environment was conducive to intensive agriculture and harvests big enough to support social stratification, political officials, and a state type of political system, then perhaps environmental degradation—declining soil productivity, persistent drought, and the like—contributed to the collapse of

11.7 Discuss explanations for the decline and collapse of states.

The history of Ephesus, a former city lying in ruins in what is now western Turkey, illustrates the waxing and waning of states and empires. From about 1000 b.c to 100 b.c., it was controlled by the Greeks, Lydians, Persians, Macedonians, and Romans, among others.

![](_page_14_Picture_7.jpeg)

ancient states. Archaeologist Harvey Weiss has suggested that persistent drought helped to bring about the fall of the ancient Akkadian empire in the Near East. By 2300 b.c., the Akkadians had established an empire stretching over 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) from the Persian Gulf in what is now Iraq to the headwaters of the Euphrates River in what is now Turkey. But a century later, the empire collapsed. Weiss thinks that a longterm drought brought the empire down, as well as other civilizations around at that time too. Many archaeologists doubted there was such a widespread drought, but new evidence indicates that the worst dry spell of the past 10,000 years began just as the Akkadians' northern stronghold was being abandoned.58 The evidence of the drought, windblown dust in sediment retrieved from the bottom of the Persian Gulf, indicates that the dry spell lasted 300 years. Other geophysical evidence suggests that the drought was worldwide.<sup>59</sup>

Environmental degradation may also have contributed to the collapse of Mayan civilization.60 The Mayans built large temple complexes in the lowland regions of Mexico and the Yucatán Peninsula beginning about a.d. 250, but after about a.d. 750 construction ceased, and by about a.d. 900 the temple complexes appear to have been all but abandoned. Lake sediments show that the region the Maya inhabited experienced an extended period of drought lasting between roughly a.d. 800 and a.d. 1000. The Maya, who depended on rainfall agriculture for subsistence, may not have been able to produce enough food in areas around temple complexes during this long period of drought to feed the resident populations. People would have been forced to move into less populated areas to survive, and the temple complexes would have slowly been abandoned.<sup>61</sup>

Environmental degradation may occur for reasons other than natural events. The behavior of humans may sometimes be responsible. Consider the collapse of Cahokia, a city of at least 15,000 people that thrived for a while in the area where the Missouri and Mississippi rivers converge. In the 12th century a.d., Cahokia had large public plazas, a city wall constructed from some 20,000 logs, and massive mounds. But within 300 years, only the mounds were left. Silt from flooding covered former croplands and settled areas. Geographer Bill Woods thinks that overuse of woodlands for fuel, construction, and defense led to deforestation, flooding, and persistent crop failure. The result was the abandonment of Cahokia. Timber depletion is also indicated by studies of charcoal from excavations in the area. Apparently the quality of wood used in construction declined over time, suggesting that choice trees got scarcer.<sup>62</sup>

Cahokia is just one example of degradation that may have been caused by human behavior. Another example is the increasing saltiness of soils caused by evaporation of water from fields that have been irrigated over long periods of time, as in what is now southern Iraq.

Civilizations may sometimes decline because human behavior has increased the incidence of disease. As we noted, many lowland Mayan cities were abandoned between a.d. 800 and a.d. 1000, possibly because of drought. But another factor may have been the increasing incidence of yellow fever. The clearing of forests and the consequent increase of breeding sites for mosquitoes may have favored the spread of the disease from areas farther south in Central America, or the planting of particular trees by the Maya in their urban areas may have increased the populations of coresident monkeys who carried the disease (which mosquitoes transmitted to people).<sup>63</sup>

Another reason that some states have collapsed appears to be overextension. This is often one of the reasons given for the decline of the Roman Empire. By the time of its fall, beginning in the second century a.d., the empire had expanded throughout the Mediterranean region and into northwestern Europe. That huge area may simply have been too large to administer. "Barbarian" incursions on the peripheries of the empire went unchecked because it was too difficult, and too costly, to reinforce these far-flung frontiers. Sometimes these incursions became wholesale invasions that were exacerbated by famines, plagues, and poor leadership. By the time the last Roman emperor of the West was deposed in a.d. 476, the empire had withered to virtually nothing.64

Finally, internal conflict because of leaders' mismanagement or exploitation has been put forward to explain the collapse of states. For example, Peter Charanis has argued that the Byzantine empire (the eastern half of the Roman empire) collapsed because large, powerful landholders had been allowed to take over the land of too many small holders, creating a group of overtaxed, exploited peasants with no interest in maintaining the empire. When the landholders began vying with the emperor for power, civil wars erupted, leading to disunity that left the empire vulnerable to conquest.65

Many other ideas have been put forward to explain collapse, ranging from catastrophes to almost mystical factors such as "social decadence," but, as with theories for the origin of states, no single explanation seems to fit all or even most of the situations. Although it is still not clear what specific conditions led to the emergence, or collapse, of the state in each of the early centers of civilization, the question of why states form and decline is a lively focus of research today. More satisfactory answers may come out of ongoing and future investigations.

# Summary and Review

#### Archaeological Inferences About Civilization

11.1 Explain how archaeologists infer that a particular people in the past had social classes, cities, or a centralized government.

- • Archaeologists rather than historians have studied the most ancient civilizations because those civilizations evolved before the advent of writing.
- • Archaeologists generally assume that burial finds reflecting inequality in death reflect inequality in life, at least in status and perhaps also in wealth and power. When archaeologists find other substantial differences, as in house size and furnishings, they can confirm that the society had different socioeconomic classes of people.
- • Archaeologists do not always agree on how a state should be defined, but most seem to agree that hierarchical and centralized decision making that affects a substantial population is the key criterion.
- • Most states have cities with public buildings, fulltime craft and religious specialists, an official art style, and a hierarchical social structure topped by an elite class from which the leaders are drawn.
- • Most states maintain power with a monopoly on the use of force. The state uses force or the threat of force to tax its population and to draft people for work or war.

How do archaeologists infer that a particular people in the past had social classes, cities, or a centralized government?

#### Cities and States in Southern Iraq

11.2 Describe the emergence of cities and states in southern Iraq.

- • Early state societies arose in what is now southern Iraq and southwestern Iran.
- • Burial sites from the formative era reflect differences in status. Villages specialized in the production of particular goods. Temples may have been centers of political and religious authority for several communities. Chiefdoms, each having authority over several villages, may have developed.
- • The state of Sumer in southern Iraq was unified under a single government just after 3000 b.c. It had writing, large urban centers, imposing temples, codified laws, a standing army, wide trade networks, a complex irrigation system, and a high degree of craft specialization.

How was Sumer after 3000 b.c. different from earlier societies in southern Iraq?

#### Cities and States in Mesoamerica

11.3 Describe the emergence of cities and states in Mesoamerica.

• In the formative period, small, autonomous farming villages shifted from the hilly slopes to the floor of the Teotihuacán Valley, probably in association with

the use of irrigation. Small "elite" centers emerged, each having a raised platform that supported temples and residences.

- • The city and state of Teotihuacán developed somewhat later in the Valley of Mexico and likely influenced much of Mesoamerica. Teotihuacán-style pottery and architectural elements are spread extensively, and graves include significant amounts of foreign goods. Streets and buildings were laid out in a grid pattern that involved much planning.
- • The earliest city-state in Mesoamerica developed in the Valley of Oaxaca, with a capital at Monte Albán. It may have originally been founded in the late formative period as a neutral place where different political units in the valley could coordinate activities affecting the whole valley.
- • Mayan state societies were densely populated and dependent on intensive agriculture. Their societies may have been more urban and complex than previously thought.

What social, economic, and political features characterize Mesoamerican state societies?

#### The First Cities and States in Other Areas

11.4 Describe the first cities and states in other areas of the world.

- • City and states arose early on the African, Asian, South American, and North American continents.
- • In Africa, the Nile Valley in Egypt with a capital at Memphis supported a population that lived in selfsufficient villages; later states built the pyramids. The Axum state in Ethiopia was a center of trade with multistory stone residences. Sub-Saharan Africa comprised a succession of city-states.
- • In Asia, the Harappan civilization in the Indus Valley of India controlled enormous territory with major cities built on similar patterns that included municipal water and sewage systems. The Shang dynasty in China was a stratified and specialized state society with religious, economic, and administrative unification and a distinctive art style.
- • In South America, state societies near present-day Lima, Peru, had independent cities, plazas, and large pyramids, and those in the Andes had complex agricultural systems with irrigation, a widespread system of religious symbols and beliefs, and art.

• In North America, Cahokia, near present-day St. Louis, was a huge settlement with a powerful chiefdom, religious and craft specialists, and social stratification.

What were the first cities and states like in Asia, Africa, South America, and North America?

#### Theories About the Origin of the State

11.5 Evaluate the major theories about the origin of the state.

- • The irrigation theory suggests that the administrative needs of maintaining extensive irrigation systems may have been the impetus for state formation.
- • The circumscription theory suggests that states emerge when competition and warfare in circumscribed areas lead to the subordination of defeated groups, which are obliged to submit to the control of the most powerful group.
- • Theories involving trade suggest that the organizational requirements of producing exportable items, redistributing imported items, and defending trading parties would foster state formation.
- • At this point, no one theory is able to explain the formation of every state. Perhaps different organizational requirements in different areas all favored centralized government.

Why is there not yet a widely accepted theory for the origin of the state?

### The Consequences of State Formation

#### 11.6 Identify and explain consequences of state formation.

- • Populations grow and become concentrated in cities.
- • More efficient agriculture allows many people to be removed from food production. As a result, art, music, literature, and organized religion can develop and flourish.
- • Militaristic expansion and conquest occurs, and leaders wield power over their own populations. An underclass of poor and often unhealthy people emerges.

• Epidemic disease and periodic famine affect the population, often resulting from dense populations and issues with food production.

What characteristics of states allow them to expand and conquer non-state societies?

#### The Decline and Collapse of States

11.7 Discuss explanations for the decline and collapse of states.

- • All ancient states collapsed eventually. As with theories for the origin of states, no single explanation seems to fit all or even most of the situations. Research into this question may have implications for prolonging the lives of our modern state systems.
- • Four possible reasons may partially explain the collapse of a state: (1) environmental degradation, (2) human behavior that may increase the incidence of disease, (3) overextension that may deplete resources, and (4) internal conflict that results from leaders' mismanagement or exploitation.
