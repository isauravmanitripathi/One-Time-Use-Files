umans belong to the order Primates. All living primates, including humans, evolved from earlier primates that are now extinct. How do primates differ from other mammals? And what distinguishes humans from the other primates? After discussing these questions, we turn to the evolution of the primates: When, where, and why did the early primates emerge, and how and why did they diverge? Our overview covers the period from about 65 million years ago to the end of the Miocene, a little over 5 million years ago.

5.1 Identify common primate traits.

## Common Primate Traits

All primates belong to the class Mammalia, and they share all the common features of mammals. Except for humans, the bodies of primates are covered with dense hair or fur, which provides insulation. Even humans have hair in various places, though perhaps not always for insulation. Mammals are *warm-blooded*; that is, their body temperature is more or less constantly warm and usually higher than that of the air around them. Almost all mammals give birth to live young that develop to a considerable size within the mother and are nourished by suckling from the mother's mammary glands. The young have a relatively long period of dependence on adults after birth. This period is also a time of learning, for a great deal of adult mammal behavior is learned rather than instinctive. Play is a learning technique common to mammal young and is especially important to primates.

The primates have a number of physical and social traits that set them apart from other mammals. No one of the primates' physical features is unique to primates; animals from other orders share one or more of the following described characteristics. But the complex of all these physical traits is unique to primates.

Many skeletal features of the primates reflect an **arboreal** (tree-living) existence. All primate hind limbs are structured principally to provide support, but the "feet" in most primates can also grasp things (see Figure 5.1). Some primates—orangutans, for

Arboreal Adapted to living in trees.

instance—can suspend themselves from their hind limbs. The forelimbs are especially flexible, built to withstand both pushing and pulling forces. Each of the hind limbs and forelimbs has one bone in the upper portion and two bones in the lower portion (with the exception of the tarsier). This feature has changed little since the time of the earliest primate ancestors. It has remained in modern primates (although many other mammals have lost it) because the double bones give great mobility for rotating arms and legs.

Another characteristic structure of primates is the clavicle, or collarbone. The clavicle also gives primates great freedom of movement, allowing them to move the shoulders both up and down and back and forth. Although humans obviously do not use this flexibility for arboreal activity, we do use it for other activities. Without a clavicle, we could not throw a spear or a ball; we could not make any fine tools or turn doorknobs if we did not have rotatable forearms.

Primates generally are **omnivorous**; that is, they eat all kinds of food, including insects and small animals, as well as fruits, seeds, leaves, and roots. The teeth of primates reflect this omnivorous diet. The chewing teeth—the *molars* and *premolars*—are unspecialized, particularly in comparison with those of other groups of animals, such as the grazers. The front teeth—the *incisors* and *canines*—are often very specialized, principally in the lower primates. For example, the slender, tightly packed lower incisors and canines in many prosimians form a "dental comb" that the animals use in grooming or for scraping hardened tree gum (which is a food for them) from tree trunks.2

Primate hands are extremely flexible. All primates have prehensile—grasping—hands, which can be wrapped around an object. Primates have five digits on both hands and feet (in some cases, one digit may be reduced to a stub), and their nails, with few exceptions, are broad and flat, not clawlike. This structure allows them to grip objects; the hairless, sensitive pads on their fingers, toes, heels, and palms also help them grip. Most primates have **opposable thumbs**, a feature that allows an even more precise and powerful grip.

Vision is very important to primate life. Compared with other mammals, primates have a relatively larger portion of the brain devoted to vision rather than smell. Primates are characterized by stereoscopic, or depth, vision. Their eyes are directed forward rather than sideways, as in other animals—a trait that allows them to focus on an object (insects or other food or a distant branch) with both eyes at once. Most primates also have color vision, perhaps to recognize when plant foods are ready to eat.

Another important primate feature is a large brain relative to body size. That is, primates generally have larger brains than animals of similar size, perhaps because their survival depends on an enormous amount of learning, as we discuss later. In general, animals with large brains seem to mature more slowly and to live longer than animals with small brains.<sup>3</sup> The more slowly an animal matures and the longer it lives, the more it can learn.

For the most part, primates are social animals. For most primates, particularly those that are **diurnal**—that is, active during the day—group life may be crucial to survival. Social relationships begin with the mother and other adults during the fairly long dependency period of primates. The prolonged dependency of infant monkeys and apes probably offers an evolutionary advantage in that it allows infants more time to observe and learn the complex behaviors essential to survival while enjoying the care and protection of mature adults.

# The Various Living Primates

The order Primates is traditionally divided into two suborders: the *prosimians*—literally, premonkeys—and the *anthropoids.* (A newer classification divides the primates into those with wet noses, the *strepsirrhines*, and those with dry noses, the *haplorhines.* We use the traditional classification because we think it is easier to understand.) The **prosimians** include lemurs, lorises, and tarsiers. The **anthropoid** suborder includes New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, the lesser apes (gibbons, siamangs), the great apes (orangutans, gorillas, and chimpanzees), and humans.

**Omnivorous** Eating both meat and vegetation.

**Opposable thumbs** A thumb that can touch the tips of all the other fingers.

**Diurnal** Active during the day.

**Prosimians** Literally "pre-monkeys," one of the two suborders of primates; includes lemurs, lorises, and tarsiers.

**Anthropoids** One of the two suborders of primates; includes monkeys, apes, and humans.

5.2 Describe the major types of living primates and their geographical distribution.

# **Applied Anthropology**

#### **Endangered Primates**

n contrast to many human populations that are too numerous for their resources, many populations of nonhuman primates face extinction because they are not numerous enough. The two trends—human overpopulation and nonhuman primate extinctions—are related. Were it not for human expansion in many parts of the world, the nonhuman primates living in those habitats would not be endangered. Various lemur and other prosimian species of Madagascar, gorillas and red colobus monkeys of Africa, langurs, gibbons, orangutans of Asia, and the tamarin monkeys of Brazil are among the species most at risk.

Many factors are responsible for the difficulties that nonhuman primates face, but most of them are directly or indirectly the result of human activity. Perhaps the biggest problem is the destruction of tropical rain forest, the habitat of most nonhuman primates, because of encroaching agriculture and cattle ranching and the felling of trees for wood products. The people who live in these areas are partly responsible for the threats to nonhuman primates—population pressure in the human populations increases the likelihood that more forest will be cleared and burned for agriculture, and

nonhuman primates are an important source of hunted food in some areas. But world market forces are probably more important. The increasing need for "American" hamburger in fast-food restaurants has accelerated the search for places to raise beef inexpensively. There is also enormous demand for wood products from tropical forests;

Japan imports half of all the timber from rain forests to use for plywood, cardboard, paper, and furniture.

Some would argue that it is important to preserve all species. Primatologists remind us that it is especially important to preserve primate diversity. One reason is the scientific one of needing those populations to study and understand how humans are similar and different and how they came to be that way. Another reason is the usefulness of nonhuman primates in biomedical research on human diseases: we share many of our diseases, and many of our genes, with our primate relatives (chimpanzees share more than 98 percent of their genes with humans). The film The Planet of the Apes, in which the humans are subordinate to the apes, tells us that the primates in zoos could have been us.

So how can nonhuman primates be protected from us? There really are only two major ways: Either human population growth in many places has to be curtailed, or we have to preserve substantial populations of nonhuman primates in protected parks and zoos. Both are difficult but humanly possible.

#### Prosimians

**Quadrupeds** Animals that walk on all fours.

#### Vertical clinging and

**leaping** A locomotor pattern characteristic of several primates, including tarsiers and galagos. The animal normally rests by clinging to a branch in a vertical position and uses its hind limbs alone to push off from one vertical position to another.

Nocturnal Active during the night.

The prosimians resemble other mammals more than the anthropoid primates do. For example, the prosimians depend much more on smell for information than do anthropoids. Also in contrast with the anthropoids, they typically have more mobile ears, whiskers, longer snouts, and relatively fixed facial expressions. The prosimians also exhibit many traits shared by all primates, including grasping hands, stereoscopic vision, and enlarged visual centers in the brain.

**Lemurlike Forms** Lemurs and their relatives, the indris and the aye-ayes, are found only on two island areas off the southeastern coast of Africa: Madagascar and the Comoro Islands. These primates range in size from the mouse lemur to the 4-foot-long indri. Members of the lemur group usually produce single offspring, although twins and even triplets are common in some species. Many of the species in this group are **quadrupeds**—animals that move on all fours; they walk on all fours in the trees as well as on the ground. Some species, such as the indris, use their hind limbs alone to push off from one vertical position to another in a mode of locomotion called **vertical clinging and leaping**. Lemurs are mostly vegetarians, eating fruit, leaves, bark, and flowers. Lemur species vary greatly in their group size. Many lemur species, particularly those that are **nocturnal** (active during the night),

are solitary during their active hours. Others are much more social, living in groups ranging in size from a small family to as many as 60 members.4 An unusual feature of the lemurlike primates is that females often dominate males, particularly over access to food. In most primates, and in most other mammals, female dominance is rarely observed.<sup>5</sup>

Lorislike Forms Members of the loris group, found in both Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, are all nocturnal and arboreal. They eat fruit, tree gum, and insects and usually give birth to single infants.<sup>6</sup> There are two major subfamilies, the lorises and the bush babies (galagos), and they show wide behavioral differences. Bush babies are quick, active animals that hop between branches and tree trunks in the vertical-clinging-and-leaping pattern. On the ground, they often resort to a kangaroolike hop. Lorises are much slower, walking sedately along branches hand over hand in the quadrupedal fashion.

Tarsiers The nocturnal, tree-living tarsiers, found now only on the islands of the Philippines and Indonesia, are the only primates that depend completely on animal

foods. They are usually insect eaters, but they sometimes capture and eat other small animals. They are well equipped for night vision, possessing enormous eyes, extraordinary eyesight, and enlarged visual centers in the brain. The tarsiers get their name from their elongated tarsal bones (the bones of the ankle), which give them tremendous leverage for their long jumps. Tarsiers are very skilled at vertical clinging and leaping. They live in family groups composed of a mated pair and their offspring. Like some higher primates, male and female tarsiers sing together each evening to advertise their territories.7 The classification of tarsiers is somewhat controversial. Some classifiers group tarsiers with anthropoids rather than with prosimians. In this classification scheme, the suborders of primates are labeled *strepsirrhines* (which includes lemurs and lorises) and *haplorhines* (which includes tarsiers and anthropoids). Tarsiers have chromosomes similar to those of other prosimians; they also have claws for grooming on some of their toes, more than two nipples, and a uterus shaped like that of other prosimians (two-horned). Tarsiers are more like anthropoids in having a reduced dependence on smell. And, in common with the anthropoids, their eyes are closer together and are protected by bony orbits.8

#### Anthropoids

The anthropoid suborder includes humans, apes, and monkeys. Most anthropoids share several traits in varying degrees. They have rounded braincases; reduced, nonmobile outer ears; and relatively small, flat faces instead of muzzles. They have highly efficient reproductive systems. They also have highly dexterous hands.9 The anthropoid order is divided into two main groups: **platyrrhines** and **catarrhines** (see Figure 5.2). Platyrrhines have broad, flat-bridged noses, with nostrils facing outward; these monkeys are found only in the New World, in Central and South America. Catarrhines have narrow noses with nostrils facing downward. Catarrhines include monkeys of the Old World (Africa, Asia, and Europe) as well as apes and humans.

New World Monkeys Besides the shape of the nose and the position of the nostrils, other anatomical features distinguish the New World monkeys (platyrrhines) from the catarrhine anthropoids. The New World species have three premolars, whereas the Old World species have two. Some New World monkeys have a **prehensile** (grasping) tail; no Old World monkeys do. All the New World monkeys are completely arboreal; they vary a lot in the size of their groups; and their food ranges from insects to nectar and sap to fruits and leaves.<sup>10</sup>

Two main families of New World monkeys have traditionally been defined. One family, the *callitrichids*, contains marmosets and tamarins; the other family, the *cebids*, contains all the other New World monkeys. The callitrichids are very small, have claws instead of fingernails, and give birth to twins who mature in about 2 years. Perhaps because twinning is so common and the infants have to be carried, callitrichid mothers

cannot take care of them alone. Fathers and older siblings have often been observed carrying infants. Indeed, males may do more carrying than females. Callitrichid groups may contain a mated pair (monogamy) or a female mated to more than one male (polyandry). The callitrichids eat a lot of fruit and tree sap, but like other very small primates, they obtain a large portion of their protein requirements from insects. $^{11}$ 

Cebids are generally larger than callitrichids, take about twice as long to mature, and tend to bear only one offspring at a time.<sup>12</sup> The cebids vary widely in size, group composition, and diet. For example, squirrel monkeys weigh about 2 pounds, whereas woolly spider monkeys weigh more than 16 pounds. Some cebids have small groups with one male-female pair; others have groups of up to 50 individuals. Some of the smallest cebids have a diet of leaves, insects, flowers, and fruits, whereas others are mostly fruit eaters with lesser dependence on seeds, leaves, or insects.<sup>13</sup>

**Old World Monkeys** The Old World monkeys, or cercopithecoids, are related more closely to humans than to New World monkeys. They have the same number of teeth as apes and humans. The Old World monkey species are not as diverse as their New World cousins, but they live in a greater variety of habitats. Some live both in trees and on the ground; others, such as the gelada baboon, are completely **terrestrial**, or ground-living.

Macaques are found both in tropical jungles and on snow-covered mountains, and they range from the Rock of Gibraltar to Africa to northern India, Pakistan, and Japan. There are two major subfamilies of Old World monkeys: the *colobines* and the *cercopithecines*.

The colobines live mostly in trees, and their diet consists principally of leaves and seeds. Their digestive tracts are equipped to obtain maximum nutrition from a high-cellulose diet; they have pouched stomachs, which provide a large surface area for breaking down plant food, and very large intestinal tracts. One of the most noticeable features of colobines is the flamboyant color typical of newborns. For example, in one species, dusky gray mothers give birth to brilliant orange babies.<sup>14</sup>

The cercopithecine subfamily of monkeys includes more terrestrial species than any other subfamily of Old World monkeys. Many of these species are characterized by a great deal of **sexual dimorphism** (the sexes look very different); the males are larger, have longer

canines, and are more aggressive than the females. Cercopithecines depend more on fruit than do colobines. They are also more capable of surviving in arid and seasonal environments.15 Pouches inside the cheeks allow cercopithecines to store food for later eating and digestion. An unusual physical feature of these monkeys is the ischial callosities, or callouses, on their bottoms—an adaptation that enables them to sit comfortably in trees or on the ground for long periods of time.<sup>16</sup>

#### The Hominoids: Apes and Humans

The **hominoids** group includes three separate families: the lesser apes, or **hylobatids** (gibbons and siamangs); the great apes, or **pongids** (orangutans, gorillas, and chimpanzees); and humans, or **hominins** (actually a subfamily of the hominid family, one of several classificatory technicalities that we try to avoid here in order to simplify the discussion). Their brains are relatively large, especially the areas of the cerebral cortex associated with the ability to integrate data. All hominoids have fairly long arms; short, broad trunks; and no tails. The wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints of hominoids allow a greater range of movement than in other primates. Hominoid hands are longer and stronger than those of other primates. These skeletal features probably evolved along with the hominoids' unique abilities in suspensory locomotion. Unlike other anthropoids, who move quadrupedally along the ground or along the tops of tree branches, hominoids often suspend themselves from

below the branches and swing or climb hand over hand from branch to branch.17 This suspensory posture also translates to locomotion on the ground; all hominoids, at least occasionally, move bipedally, as we discuss in more detail later in this chapter.

The dentition of hominoids demonstrates some unique features as well (see Figure 5.3). Hominoid molars are flat and rounded compared to those of other anthropoids and have what is called a "Y-5" pattern on the lower molars—that is, the lower molars have five cusps with a Y-shaped groove opening toward the cheek running between them.

A young gorilla shows how it knucklewalks. The back feet are flat on the ground, and only the knuckles of the "hands" touch the ground.

Other anthropoids have what is called a **bilophodont** pattern—their molars have two ridges or "loafs" running perpendicular to the cheeks. All hominoids, except for humans, also have long canine teeth that project beyond the tops of the other teeth and a corresponding space on the opposite jaw, called a **diastema**, where the canine sits when the jaws are closed. The contact of the upper canine and the lower third premolar creates a sharp cutting edge, in part due to the premolar being elongated to accommodate the canine.18 These dental features are related to the hominoids' diets, which often include both fibrous plant materials, which can be efficiently cut with sharp canines against elongated premolars, and soft fruits, which can be efficiently chewed with wide, flat molars.

The skeletal and dental features that the hominoids share point toward their common ancestry. Their proteins and DNA show many similarities, too. This genetic likeness is particularly strong among chimpanzees, gorillas, and humans.19 For this reason, primatologists think chimpanzees and gorillas are evolutionarily closer to humans than are the lesser apes and orangutans, which probably branched off at some earlier point. We discuss the fossil evidence that supports an early split for the orangutans later in the chapter.

Gibbons and Siamangs The agile gibbons and their close relatives, the siamangs, are found in the jungles of Southeast Asia. The gibbons are small, weighing only between 11 and 15 pounds. The siamangs are somewhat larger, but no more than 25 pounds. Both are mostly fruit eaters, although they also eat leaves and insects. They are spectacular **brachiators**; their long arms and fingers let them swing hand over hand through the trees.20 A gibbon can move more than 30 feet in a single forward swing.

Gibbons and siamangs live in small family groups consisting of an adult pair, who appear to mate for life, and one or two immature offspring. When the young reach adulthood, they are driven from home by the adults. There is little sexual dimorphism—males and females do not differ in size or appearance—nor is there any clear pattern of dominance by either

> sex. These lesser apes are also highly territorial; an adult pair advertises their territory by singing and defends it by chasing others away.21

Orangutans Orangutans survive only on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. Unlike gibbons and siamangs, they are clearly recognizable as males or females. Males not only weigh almost twice as much as females (up to 200 pounds) but they also have large cheek pads, throat pouches, beards, and long hair.22 Like gibbons and siamangs, orangutans are primarily fruit eaters and arboreal. They are the heaviest of the arboreal primates, and perhaps they move slowly and laboriously through the trees for this reason. Orangutans are unusual among the higher primates in that, except for mothers and their young, adults spend much of their time alone.

Gorillas Gorillas are found in the lowland areas of western equatorial Africa and in the mountain areas of Congo, Uganda, and Rwanda.23 Unlike the other apes, who are mostly fruit eaters, gorillas mostly eat other parts of plants stems, shoots (e.g., bamboo), pith, leaves, roots, and flowers. In many populations, fruit eating is rare; in some, however, fruit is a common part of the diet.24

Gorillas are by far the largest of the surviving apes. In their natural habitats, adult males weigh up to 450 pounds and females up to 250 pounds. To support the weight of massive chests, gorillas travel mostly on the ground on all fours in a form of locomotion known as **knuckle walking**: they walk on the thickly padded middle joints of their fingers. Gorillas' arms and legs, especially those of the young, are well suited for climbing. As adults, their heavier bodies make climbing more precarious.25 They sleep on the ground or in tub-shaped nests they make from nonfood plants each time they bed down.<sup>26</sup>

Gorillas tend to live in groups consisting of a dominant male, called a silverback, other adult males, adult females, and immature offspring. Both males and females, when mature, seem to leave the groups into which they were born to join other groups. The dominant male is very much the center of attention; he acts as the main protector of the group and the leader in deciding where the group will go next.27

Chimpanzees Chimpanzees live in the forested areas of Africa, from Guinea Bissau in the west to Tanzania in the east. There are two distinct species of chimpanzee—the common chimpanzee (*Pan troglodytes*) and the bonobo, or pygmy, chimpanzee (*Pan paniscus*). Bonobos tend to be more slender than common chimpanzees, with longer limbs and digits, smaller heads, darker faces, and a distinct part in their hair. Unlike common chimpanzees, bonobos show almost no sexual dimorphism in dentition or skeletal structure. More significant seem to be differences in social behavior. Bonobos are more gregarious than common chimpanzees, and groups tend to be more stable. Groups also tend to be centered around females rather than males.28

Although they are primarily fruit eaters, chimpanzees show many similarities to their close relatives, the gorillas. Both are arboreal and terrestrial. Like gorillas, chimpanzees move best on the ground, and when they want to cover long distances, they come down from the trees and move by knuckle walking. Occasionally, they stand and walk upright, usually when they are traveling through tall grass or are trying to see long distances. Chimpanzees sleep in tree nests that they carefully prepare anew, complete with a bunch of leaves as a pillow, each time they bed down.29

Chimpanzees (including bonobos) are less sexually dimorphic than the other great apes. Males weigh a little more than 100 pounds on the average, females somewhat less. Males also have longer canines.

After five decades of studies at Gombe National Park in Tanzania and elsewhere, researchers have found that common chimpanzees not only eat insects, small lizards, and birds, but they also actively hunt and kill larger animals.30 At Gombe, the red colobus monkey is by far the most often hunted animal. Hunting appears to be undertaken more **Diastema** A gap between the canine and first premolar found in apes.

often during the dry season when food is scarce. 31 Prey is caught mostly by the males, which hunt either alone or in small groups. It is then shared with—or, perhaps more accurately, begged by—as many as 15 other chimpanzees in friendly social gatherings that may last up to 9 hours.<sup>32</sup>

Hominins According to the classification we use here, the hominoids we call hominins include only one living species—modern humans. Humans have many distinctive characteristics that set them apart from other anthropoids and other hominoids, which lead many to place humans in a category separate from the pongids. However, others believe that the differences are not so great as to justify a separate hominin category for humans. For example, humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas are very similar in their proteins and DNA. Whether we stress the similarities or differences between humans and apes does not matter that much; what does matter is that we try to understand the reasons for those similarities and differences.

## Distinctive Hominin Traits

We turn now to some of the features that distinguish us—the hominins—from the other primates. Although we like to think of ourselves as unique, many of the traits we discuss here are at the extreme of a continuum that can be traced from the prosimians through the apes.

#### Physical Traits

Of all the primates, only hominins consistently walk erect on two feet. All other primates require thick, heavy musculature to hold their heads erect; this structure is missing in hominins, for our heads are more or less balanced on top of our spinal columns. A dishshaped pelvis (peculiar to hominins), a lumbar curve in the spine, straight lower limbs, and arched, nonprehensile feet are all related to **bipedalism**. Because hominins are fully bipedal, we can carry objects without impairing our locomotor efficiency.

Although many primates have an opposable thumb, which enables them to grasp and examine objects, the greater length and flexibility of the hominin thumb allow us to handle objects with greater dexterity. We are capable of both a power grip, to hold large or heavy objects firmly, and a precision grip, to hold small or delicate objects without dropping or breaking them. We also have remarkable hand–eye coordination, as well as a remarkably sophisticated brain.

The hominin brain is large and complex, particularly the **cerebral cortex**, the center of speech and other higher mental activities. The brain of the average adult modern human measures more than 79 cubic inches (1,300 cubic centimeters), compared with 32 cubic inches (525 cubic centimeters) for the gorilla, the primate with the next largest brain. The frontal areas of the hominin brain are also larger than those of other primates, so that hominins have more prominent foreheads than monkeys or gorillas. Hominins have special areas of the brain that are dedicated to speech and language. The large hominin brain requires an enormous amount of blood, and the way blood is carried to and from the brain is also unique.33 We'll say more about the hominin brain and its evolution in the next chapter.

Hominin teeth reflect our completely omnivorous diet, and they are not very specialized, which may reflect the fact that we use tools and cooking to prepare our food. As discussed earlier, other hominoids have long canines and a diastema, whereas hominin canines do not usually project beyond the tops of the other teeth. This allows hominins to move their jaws both vertically and horizontally when chewing; horizontal movement would be prevented by the long upper canines of the other hominoids. Hominin molars have thicker enamel than the molars of other hominoids, and both horizontal movement and thickened molars may be related to a dietary emphasis on coarse grains and seeds. The hominin jaw is shaped like a parabolic arch, rather than a U-shape, as in the apes, and is composed of relatively thin bones and light muscles. Modern humans have chins; other primates do not.

5.3 Describe the traits that distinguish hominins from other anthropoids.

**Bipedalism** Locomotion in which an animal walks on its two hind legs.

#### **Cerebral cortex** The "gray matter" of the brain; the center of speech and other higher mental activities.

One other important hominin trait is the sexuality of hominin females, who may engage in intercourse at any time throughout the year; most other primate females engage in sex only periodically, just around the time they can conceive.34 Hominins are also unusual among the primates in having female–male bonding.<sup>35</sup>

Why, then, does hominin female sexuality differ from that of most other primates? One suggestion is that more or less continuous female sexuality became selectively advantageous in hominins after female–male bonding developed in conjunction with local groups consisting of at least several adult males and adult females.36 More specifically, the combination of group living and male–female bonding—a combination unique to hominins among the primates—may have favored a switch from the common higher-primate pattern of periodic female sexuality to the pattern of more or less continuous female sexuality. Such a switch may have been favored in hominins because periodic, rather than continuous, female sexuality would undermine female–male bonding in multi-male–multi-female groups.

Field research on nonhuman primates strongly suggests that males usually attempt to mate with any females ready to mate. If the female (or females) a male was bonded to was not interested in sex at certain times, but other females in the group were, it seems likely that the male would try to mate with those other females. Frequent "extramarital affairs" might jeopardize the male–female bond and thereby presumably reduce the reproductive success of both males and females. Hence, natural selection may have favored more or less continuous sexuality in hominin females if hominins already had the combination of group living (and the possibility of "extramarital affairs") and marriage. If bonded adults lived alone, as do gibbons, noncontinuous female sexuality would not threaten bonding, because "extramarital" sex would not be likely to occur. Similarly, seasonal breeding would also pose little threat to male–female bonds, because all females would be sexually active at more or less the same time.37 So the fact that the combination of group living and male–female

bonding occurs only in hominins may explain why continuous female sexuality developed in hominins. The bonobo, or pygmy chimpanzee, female does engage in intercourse throughout the year, but bonobos do not have male–female bonding, and the females are not interested in sex quite as often as hominin females.38

#### Behavioral Abilities

In comparison with other primates, a much greater proportion of hominin behavior is learned and culturally patterned. As with many physical traits, we can trace a continuum in the learning abilities of all primates. The great apes, including orangutans, gorillas, and chimpanzees, are probably about equal in learning ability.39 Old and New World monkeys do much less well in learning tests, and, surprisingly, gibbons perform more poorly than most monkeys.

Toolmaking The same kind of continuum is evident in inventiveness and toolmaking. There is scant evidence of nonhuman primates except great apes using tools, although several species of monkeys use "weapons"—branches, stones, or fruit dropped onto predators below them on the ground. Chimpanzees both fashion and use tools in the wild. They strip leaves from sticks and then use the sticks to "fish" termites from their mound-shaped nests. They use leaves to mop up termites, to sponge up water, or to wipe themselves clean. Indeed, tool use varies enough in chimpanzees that primatologist Christophe Boesch has suggested that local chimpanzee groups have cultural differences in terms of the tools they employ.40

One example of chimpanzee tool use suggests planning. In Guinea, West Africa, observers watched a number of chimpanzees crack oil palm nuts with two stones. The "platform" stone had a hollow depression; the other stone was used for pounding. The observers assumed that the stones had been brought by the chimpanzees to the palm trees because no stones like them were nearby and the chimps were observed to leave the pounding stone on top of or near the platform stone when

Chimps in the wild use tools—in this case, a stone to crack palm nuts. As far as we know, though, they don't use tools to make other tools, as humans do.

they were finished.<sup>41</sup> Observers in other areas of West Africa have also reported that chimpanzees use stones to crack nuts. In one location in Liberia, an innovative female appeared to have started the practice; it seems to have been imitated within a few months by 13 others who previously showed no interest in the practice.<sup>42</sup>

Hominins have usually been considered the only toolmaking animal, but observations such as these call for modification of the definition of toolmaking. If we define toolmaking as adapting a natural object for a specific purpose, then at least some of the great apes are toolmakers too. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say hominins are the only habitual toolmaking animal, just as we say hominins are the only habitual bipedal hominoid, even though the other hominoids all can and do walk bipedally sometimes. As far as we know, though, hominins are unique in their ability to use one tool to make another.

Language Only modern humans have spoken, symbolic language. But, as with toolmaking abilities, the line between modern human language and the communications of other primates is not as sharp as we once thought. In the wild, vervet monkeys make different alarm calls to warn of different predators. Observers playing tape recordings of these calls found that monkeys responded to them differently depending on the call. If the monkeys heard an "eagle" call, they looked up; if they heard a "leopard" call, they ran high into the trees.43

Common chimpanzees are also communicative, using gestures and many vocalizations in the wild. Researchers have used this "natural talent" to teach chimpanzees symbolic language in experimental settings. In their pioneering work, Beatrice T. Gardner and R. Allen Gardner raised a female chimpanzee named Washoe and trained her to communicate with startling effectiveness by means of American Sign Language hand gestures.44 After a year of training, she was able to associate gestures with specific activities. For example, if thirsty, Washoe would make the signal for "give me" followed by the one for "drink." As she learned, the instructions grew more detailed. If all she wanted was water, she would merely signal for "drink." But if she craved soda pop, as she did more and more, she prefaced the drink signal with the sweet signal—a quick touching of the tongue with her fingers. Later, the Gardners had even more success in training four other common chimpanzees, who were taught by fluent deaf users of American Sign Language.45

Bonobos have provided strong evidence that they understand simple grammatical "rules," very much like 2-year-old humans. Pointing to graphic symbols for different particular meanings, a bonobo named Kanzi regularly communicated sequences of types of symbols; for example, he would point to a symbol for a verb ("bite") and then point to a symbol for an object ("ball," "cherry," or "food").46

Other Hominin Traits Although many primates are omnivores, eating insects and small reptiles in addition to plants—some even hunt small mammals—only hominins hunt very large animals. Also, hominins are one of the few primates that are completely terrestrial. We do not even sleep in trees, as many other ground-living primates do. Perhaps our ancestors lost their perches when the forests receded, or cultural advances such as weapons or fire may have eliminated the need to seek nightly shelter in the trees. In addition, as we have noted, we have the longest dependency period of any of the primates, requiring extensive parental care and support for up to 20 years or so.

Finally, hominins are unlike almost all other primates in having a division of labor by gender in food-getting and food-sharing in adulthood. Among nonhuman primates, both females and males forage for themselves after infancy. Hominins have more gender-role specialization, perhaps because men, unencumbered by infants and small children, were freer to hunt and chase large animals.

Having examined our distinctive traits, those traits we share with other primates, now we turn to the fossil evidence about primate evolution, from the earliest forms to apes.

# The Emergence of Primates

When did the primates first emerge? This question turns out to be hard to answer with the current fossil record. Some paleoanthropologists have suggested that fossil finds from the **Paleocene** epoch, which began about 65 million years ago, are from archaic primates.

**Paleocene** The geological epoch 65 million to 55 million years ago.

5.4 Discuss the emergence of primates in relation to environment and adaptation.

These are the *plesiadapiforms*. They have been found in both Europe and North America, which were one connected landmass in the Paleocene. The best-known plesiadapiform is **Plesiadapis**. This squirrellike animal had a large snout and large incisors. It also had a large nasal cavity and eye orbits located on the sides of the skull, suggesting a well-developed sense of smell and little or no stereoscopic vision (depth perception). The fingers of *Plesiadapis* had claws, and its hands and feet did not appear to allow for grasping. These features suggest that *Plesiadapis* was not a primate. However, the elbow and ankle joints suggest great mobility, and the teeth suggest a primatelike omnivorous diet despite the large incisors. The structure of their inner ears also resembled that of modern primates. Because it had these primatelike features, some scholars believe that the plesiadapiforms were archaic primates.<sup>47</sup>

Other paleoanthropologists find so few similarities between the plesiadapiforms and later obvious primates that they do not include the plesiadapiforms in the order Primates.<sup>48</sup> There is no dispute, however, about fossils dating from the early **Eocene**, about 55 million years ago. These oldest definite primates appear in two major groups of prosimians *adapids* and *omomyids*. Because these two kinds of primates are different from each other in major ways, and because they both appeared rather abruptly at the border of the Paleocene and Eocene, there presumably was an earlier common primate ancestor. One strong candidate for the common primate ancestor is *Carpolestes simpsoni*, a mouse-size arboreal creature from Wyoming dating to about 56 million years ago. Carpolestes has an interesting mix of primate and nonprimate characteristics. Although it lacks stereoscopic vision, Carpolestes has nails instead of claws on its big toes, and it has grasping hands and feet.<sup>49</sup> Not all scholars are convinced that *Carpolestes* is the common ancestor of all primates, and in Figure 5.4, the circled P represents where paleontologist Robert D. Martin placed the common ancestor of primates, in the late Cretaceous.

### The Environment

It is generally agreed that the earliest primate may have emerged by the Paleocene, 65 million to 55 million years ago, and perhaps earlier, in the late **Cretaceous**. The beginning of the Paleocene marked a major geological transition, what geologists call the transition from the Mesozoic to the Cenozoic era. About 75 percent of all animal and plant life that lived in the last part of the Cenozoic (the late Cretaceous) vanished by the early Paleocene. The extinction of the dinosaurs is the most famous of these disappearances. $^{50}$ 

The climate of the Cretaceous period was almost uniformly damp and mild, but temperatures began falling at the end of the Cretaceous. Around the beginning of the Paleocene epoch, both seasonal and geographic fluctuations in temperature began to develop. The climate became much drier in many areas, and vast swamplands disappeared. The climate of the Paleocene was generally somewhat cooler than in the late Cretaceous, but by no means cold. Forests and savannas thrived in fairly high latitudes. Subtropical climates existed as far north as latitude 62 in Alaska.<sup>51</sup>

One important reason for the very different climates of the past is **continental drift** (Figure 5.5). In the early Cretaceous (circa 135 million years ago), the continents were actually clumped into two large landmasses or "supercontinents"—Laurasia, which included North America and Eurasia, and *Gondwanaland*, which included Africa, South America, India, Australia, and Antarctica. By the beginning of the Paleocene (circa 65 million years ago), Gondwanaland had broken apart, with South America drifting west away from Africa, India drifting east, and Australia and Antarctica drifting south. As the continents changed position, they moved into locations with different climatic conditions. More importantly, however, the very movement of the continents affected the climate, sometimes on a global scale.<sup>52</sup>

With changes in climate come changes in vegetation. Although the first deciduous trees (that lose their leaves in winter) and flowering plants (called *angiosperms*) arose during the Cretaceous, large trees with large fruits and seeds also became common during the late

# **Applied Anthropology**

#### **Studying Biodiversity**

he late Miocene is known as the age of the apes. Literally dozens of ape species were in the forests of Europe and Asia. What happened to all the diversity of apes, and why is there such a relative paucity of ape species today? We might ask the same question about humans. Two million years ago, there were at least four hominin species in Africa, and perhaps more, but today, there is only one. What leads to a great diversity of species, and what causes that diversity to diminish? These are central questions for applied anthropologists who study biodiversity.

Biodiversity refers to the richness of genes, species, and ecosystems within a given region. Regions with greater biodiversity are generally considered healthier and more stable than those with less biodiversity. However, there are also broad geographic differences in biodiversity, with tropical areas generally having greater biodiversity, and polar areas having lower biodiversity. Biodiversity has also changed over time, with periods of mass extinction dramatically lowering global biodiversity. Although it is clear from the primate fossil record (and

the fossil record of many other species) that biodiversity changes over time through natural processes, many scholars now believe that humans are impacting biodiversity in far more dramatic and rapid ways than ever before. And most scholars think this is a significant problem that needs to be addressed.

Biodiversity benefits humans in at least three ways. First, the maintenance of genetic variation in plant and animal species provides for innovations in agriculture such as increased yield and resistance to disease. Second, the maintenance of species diversity provides sources for new resources or technologies in things such as building materials and medicines. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, biodiversity appears to be a measure of environmental health and stability, and working to maintain biodiversity may, therefore, also serve to maintain a stable and healthy environment.

Applied anthropologists who conduct research on biodiversity tend to focus on two related aspects of biodiversity. First, they document local knowledge of biodiversity. Second, they document local practices that

help maintain biodiversity. For example, Terence Hays has spent much of his career documenting knowledge of plants among the Ndumba people of Papua New Guinea. Hays's research and that of other anthropologists has helped scholars to more fully understand the biodiversity of the New Guinea highlands. Similarly, Terence Turner has documented the political struggles of the Kayapo peoples of Brazil, who have fought logging companies and miners to protect the rain forest environment in which they live. Turner hopes that the Kayapo example can be a model for other indigenous groups struggling to protect the biodiversity of their homelands.

Even though the study of our ancient primate roots may appear to have little impact on the world today, applied anthropologists have recognized that an understanding of evolutionary patterns of biodiversity is essential to identifying trends in the modern world that point to humanimposed damage to the earth's living systems.

Paleocene and early Eocene.<sup>53</sup> Although some mammals date from the Cretaceous, the Paleocene saw the evolution and diversification of many different types of mammals, and the expansion and diversification of deciduous trees and flowering plants probably played a large role in mammalian expansion and diversification. Indeed, primate paleontologists think primates evolved from one of these mammalian *radiations*, or extensive diversifications, probably from the **insectivore** order of mammals, including modern shrews and moles, that is adapted to eating insects—insects that would have lived off the new deciduous trees and flowering plants.

The insectivores were very adaptable and were able to take advantage of many different habitats—under the ground, in water, on the ground, and above the ground, including the woody habitat of bushes, shrubs, vines, and trees. It was the last kind of adaptation, above the ground, that may have been the most important for primate evolution. The woody habitat had been exploited only partially in earlier periods. But then several different kinds, or taxa, of small animals, one of which may have been the archaic primate, began to take advantage of the woody habitat.

#### What in Particular May Have Favored the Emergence of Primates?

The traditional explanation of primate origins (the *arboreal theory*) suggests that the primates evolved from insectivores that took to the trees. Different paleoanthropologists emphasized different possible adaptations to life in the trees. In 1912, G. Elliot Smith

**Insectivore** The order or major grouping of mammals, including modern shrews and moles, that is adapted to feeding on insects

suggested that taking to the trees favored vision over smell. Vision would be more useful in an animal that searched for food in the maze of tree branches. With smaller snouts and the declining importance of the sense of smell, the eyes of the early primates would have come to face forward. In 1916, Frederic Wood Jones emphasized changes in the hand and foot. He thought that tree climbing would favor grasping hands and feet, with the hind limbs becoming more specialized for support and propulsion. In 1921, Treacher Collins suggested that the eyes of the early primates came to face forward not just because the snout got smaller. Rather, he thought that three-dimensional binocular vision would be favored because an animal jumping from branch to branch would be more likely to survive if it could accurately judge distances across open space.54 In 1968, Frederick Szalay suggested that a shift in diet—from insects to seeds, fruits, and leaves—might have been important in the differentiation of primates from insectivores.<sup>55</sup>

Arboreal theory still has some proponents, but Matt Cartmill highlighted some crucial weaknesses in the theory.56 He argued that tree living is not a good explanation for many of the primate features because there are living mammals that dwell in trees but seem to do very well without primatelike characteristics. One of the best examples, Cartmill says, is the tree squirrel. Its eyes are not front-facing, its sense of smell is not reduced in comparison with other rodents, it has claws rather than nails, and it lacks an opposable thumb. Yet these squirrels are very successful in trees. They can leap accurately from tree to tree, they can walk over or under small branches, they can go up and down vertical surfaces, and they can even hang from their hind legs to get food below them. Furthermore, other animals have some primate traits but do not live in trees or do not move around in trees as primates do. For example, carnivores, such as cats, hawks, and owls, have forward-facing eyes, and the chameleon, a reptile, and some Australian marsupial mammals that prey on insects in bushes and shrubs have grasping hands and feet.

Cartmill thinks, then, that some factor other than moving about in trees may account for the emergence of the primates. He proposes that the early primates may have been basically insect eaters and that three-dimensional vision, grasping hands and feet, and reduced claws may have been selectively advantageous for hunting insects on the slender vines and branches that filled the undergrowth of tropical forests. Three-dimensional vision would allow insect hunters to gauge the prey's distance accurately. Grasping feet would allow predators to move quietly up narrow supports to reach the prey, which could then be grabbed with the hands. Claws, Cartmill argues, would make it difficult to grasp very slender branches. And the sense of smell would have become reduced, not so much because it was no longer useful, but because the location of the eyes at the front of the face would leave less room for a snout.

Robert Sussman's theory builds on Cartmill's *visual predation theory* and on Szalay's idea about a dietary shift.57 Sussman accepts Cartmill's point that the early primates were likely to eat and move about mostly on small branches, not on large trunks and branches (as do squirrels). If they did, grasping hands and feet, and nails rather than claws (as squirrels have), would have been advantageous. Sussman also accepts Szalay's point that the early primates probably ate the new types of plant foods (flowers, seeds, and fruits) that were beginning to become abundant as flowering trees and plants spread throughout the world. But Sussman asks an important question: If the early primates ate mostly plant foods rather than quick-moving insects, why did they become more reliant on vision than on smell? Sussman suggests it was because the early primates were probably nocturnal (as many prosimians still are): If they were to locate and manipulate small food items at the ends of slender branches in dim light, they would need improved vision.

We still have very little fossil evidence of the earliest primates. *Carpolestes* suggests that grasping hands and feet evolved first, sometime in the late Paleocene, and stereoscopic vision evolved somewhat later. When more fossils become available, we may be better able to evaluate the various explanations that have been suggested for the emergence of primates.

#### Early Eocene Primates: Omomyids and Adapids

Two groups of prosimians appear in the early Eocene. One group, called **omomyids**, had many tarsierlike features; the other group, **adapids**, had many lemurlike features. The omomyids were very small, no bigger than squirrels; the adapids were kitten- and cat-sized.

**Omomyids** A type of prosimian with many tarsierlike features that appeared in the early Eocene.

**adapids** A type of prosimian with many lemurlike features; appeared in the early Eocene.

Omomyids are considered tarsierlike because of their large eyes, long tarsal bones, and very small size. The large eyes suggest that they were active at night; the smaller-sized omomyids may have been insect eaters and the larger ones may have relied more on fruit.58 Most of the omomyids had dental formulas characteristic of modern prosimians: two incisors and three premolars on each side of the lower jaw rather than the three incisors and four premolars of early mammals.59 The importance of vision is apparent in a fossilized skull of the Eocene omomyid *Tetonius.* Imprints in the skull show that the brain had large occipital and temporal lobes, the regions associated with perception and the integration of visual memory.60

The lemurlike adapids were more active during the day and relied more on leaf and fruit vegetation. In contrast to the omomyids, adapid remains show considerable sexual dimorphism in the canines. They also retain the four premolars characteristic of earlier mammals (although with fewer incisors).61 One adapid known from its abundant fossil finds is *Notharctus.* It had a small, broad face with full stereoscopic vision and a reduced muzzle. It appears to have lived in the forest and had long, powerful hind legs for leaping from tree to tree.<sup>62</sup>

There was a great deal of diversity among all mammals during the Eocene epoch, and the primates were no exception. Evolution seems to have proceeded rapidly during those years. Both the omomyids and adapids had a few features that suggest links between them and the anthropoids that appear later, in the Oligocene, but there is no agreement that either group gave rise to the anthropoids.63 Although the omomyids had some resemblances to modern tarsiers and the adapids had some resemblances to lemurs and lorises, paleoanthropologists are not sure that either group was ancestral to modern prosimians. But it is generally thought that the populations ancestral to lemurs and lorises as well as tarsiers did emerge in the Eocene or even earlier, in the late Paleocene.64

# The Emergence of Anthropoids

The anthropoids of today—monkeys, apes, and humans—are the most successful living primates and include well over 150 species. Unfortunately, the fossil record documenting the emergence of the anthropoids is extremely spotty, and there is no clear fossil record of the Old World forms (the catarrhines) in the two areas where they are most abundant today—the rain forests of sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia.65 Some paleoanthropologists think that recent Eocene primate finds from China, Southeast Asia, and Algeria have anthropoid affinities, but there is no clear agreement on their evolutionary status.66

Undisputed remains of early anthropoids date from a somewhat later period, the late Eocene and early Oligocene, about 34 million years ago, in the **Fayum** area, southwest of Cairo, Egypt. One of the earliest fossil primates at Fayum is *Catopithecus*, dating to around 35 million years ago. *Catopithecus* was about the size of a modern marmoset or squirrel monkey. Its dentition suggests a mixed diet of fruit and insects. Its eyes were small, suggesting it was active during the day (diurnal). The few skeletal remains of *Catopithecus* suggest it was an agile arboreal quadruped.67

#### Oligocene Anthropoids

The Fayum is an uninviting area of desert badlands, but it has yielded a remarkable array of early anthropoid fossils. During the **Oligocene** epoch, 34 million to 24 million years ago, the Fayum was a tropical rain forest very close to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. The area had a warm climate, and it contained many rivers and lakes. The Fayum, in fact, was far more inviting than the northern continents then, for the climates of both North America and Eurasia were beginning to cool during the Oligocene. The general cooling seems to have resulted in the virtual disappearance of primates from the northern areas, at least for a time.

Oligocene anthropoids from the Fayum are grouped into two main types: the monkeylike **parapithecids** and the apelike **propliopithecids**. Dating from 35 million to 31 million years ago, the parapithecids and the propliopithecids had enough features to be unquestionably classified as anthropoids.

#### **Parapithecids** Small

monkeylike Oligocene primates found in the Fayum area of Egypt.

**Propliopithecids** Apelike anthropoids dating from the early Oligocene, found in the Fayum area of Egypt.

Parapithecids The monkeylike parapithecids had three premolars (in each quarter), as do most prosimians and the New World monkeys. They were similar to modern anthropoids, with a bony partition behind the eye sockets, broad incisors, projecting canines, and low, rounded cusps on their molars. But they had prosimianlike premolars and relatively small brains. The parapithecids were small, generally weighing less than 3 pounds, and resembled the squirrel monkeys living now in South and Central America.68 Their relatively small eye sockets suggest that they were not nocturnal. Their teeth suggest that they ate mostly fruits and seeds. Locomotion is best known from one of the parapithecids, *Apidium*, an arboreal quadruped that also did a considerable amount of leaping.69 The parapithecids are the earliest definite anthropoid group, and although there is still disagreement among paleoanthropologists, most believe that the emergence of the anthropoids preceded the split between the New World monkeys (platyrrhines) and the Old World monkeys (catarrhines).70

That parapithecids may be ancestral to New World monkeys (platyrrhines) raises an interesting puzzle in primate evolution: the origin of the New World monkeys. Anthropoidal primates such as *Dolichocebus*, a small fruit-eating monkey similar to the modern squirrel monkey,71 appear suddenly and without any apparent ancestors in South America around 25 million years ago. Because the parapithecids predate the appearance of anthropoids in South America, and resemble them in many ways, it seems reasonable to view them as part of the population ancestral to the New World monkeys.72

But how did anthropoidal primates get from Africa to South America? Although the continents were closer together in the late Oligocene, when primates first appeared in South America, at least 1,864 miles (3,000 kilometers) separated South America and Africa. An extended continental shelf and islands created by lower sea levels in the late Oligocene may have made it possible to "island-hop" from Africa to South America over ocean stretches as short as 125 miles (200 kilometers), but that is still a long distance for an arboreal primate.

Going from Africa to Europe and North America, which were still joined in the late Oligocene, is not a likely route either. North America and South America were not joined until some 5 million years ago, so even if the ancestors of the New World monkeys made it to North America, they would still have needed to make a long ocean crossing to reach South America. One suggestion is that the ancestors of the New World monkeys "rafted" across the Atlantic on large mats of vegetation. Such rafts of matted plants, roots, and soil break away from the mouths of major rivers today, and they can be quite large. It seems an unlikely scenario, but many scholars believe such drifting vegetation must have been the means of bringing anthropoids to South America.73

*Aegyptopithecus* An Oligocene anthropoid and probably the bestknown propliopithecid.

![](_page_17_Picture_6.jpeg)

The skull of an Aegyptopithecus from the Fayum. Its dentition, small bony eye sockets, and relatively large brain make it an unambiguous ancestor of Old World monkeys and apes.

Propliopithecids The other type of anthropoid found in the Fayum, the propliopithecids, had the dental formula of modern catarrhines. This trait clearly places the proplio-

pithecids with the catarrhines.74 In contrast with the parapithecids, which had three premolars (in each quarter of the jaw), the propliopithecids had only two premolars, as do modern apes, humans, and Old World monkeys. Propliopithecids shared with the parapithecids the anthropoid dental characteristics of broad lower incisors, projecting canines, and lower molars with low, rounded cusps. And, like parapithecids, propliopithecids had a bony partition behind the eye socket.

**Aegyptopithecus**, the best-known propliopithecid, probably moved around quadrupedally in the trees and weighed about 13 pounds. Its molars were low with large cusps, and it had relatively large incisors, suggesting that *Aegyptopithecus* ate mostly fruit. Its eyes were relatively small, and thus it was probably active during the day. It had a long muzzle and a relatively small brain. Endocasts of the brain cavity suggest *Aegyptopithecus* had a relatively large area of the brain dedicated to vision and a relatively small area dedicated to smell.

The skulls of *Aegyptopithecus* show considerable sexual dimorphism, and individuals also changed dramatically as they aged, developing bony ridges along the top and across the back of the skull, much like modern great apes. Although its teeth, jaws, and some aspects of the skull were apelike, the rest of *Aegyptopithecus*'s skeleton was monkeylike,<sup>75</sup> and most scholars classify them as primitive catarrhines. Because the propliopithecids lack the specialized characteristics of living Old World monkeys and apes (catarrhines) but share the dental formula of the catarrhines, some paleoanthropologists think that the propliopithecids included the ancestor of both the Old World monkeys and the hominoids (apes and humans).<sup>76</sup>

# The Emergence of Hominoids

During the **Miocene** epoch, 24 million to 5.2 million years ago, monkeys and apes clearly diverged in appearance, and numerous kinds of apes appeared in Europe, Asia, and Africa. In the early Miocene, the temperatures were considerably warmer than in the Oligocene. From early to late Miocene, conditions became drier, particularly in East Africa. The reasons for this relate again to continental drift. By about 18 million years ago, Africa came into contact with Eurasia, ending the moderating effect that the Tethys Sea, which separated Africa from Eurasia, had on the climates of both continents. The contact of Africa and, more significantly, India with the Eurasian continent also initiated mountain building, changing established weather patterns. The overall effect was that southern Eurasia and eastern Africa became considerably drier than they had been. Once again, these changes appear to have significantly influenced primate evolution.

Most of the fossils from the early Miocene are described as proto-apes. They have been found mostly in Africa. The best-known genus is **Proconsul**, found in sites in Kenya and Uganda that are about 20 million years old.77

All of the various *Proconsul* species that have been found were much bigger than any of the anthropoids of the Oligocene, ranging from about the size of a gibbon to that of a female gorilla.78 They lacked a tail. That lack is one of the most definitive features of hominoids, and most paleoanthropologists now agree that *Proconsul* was definitely hominoid but quite unlike any ape living today. Modern hominoids have many anatomical features of the shoulder, elbow, wrists, and fingers that are adapted for locomotion by suspension (brachiation). Suspension was apparently not *Proconsul'*s method of getting around. Its elbows, wrists, and fingers may have permitted brachiation,79 but, like the Oligocene anthropoids, *Proconsul* was primarily an arboreal quadruped. Some of the larger forms may have sometimes moved on the ground. Judging by teeth, most *Proconsul* species appear to have been fruit eaters, but larger species may have also consumed leaves.80

#### Middle Miocene Apes

The first definitely apelike finds come from the middle Miocene, 16 million to 10 million years ago. The oldest, dating to about 13 million years ago, is **Pierolapithecus**, and was recently found near Barcelona, Spain.81 Another hominoid, **Kenyapithecus**, was found on Maboko Island and nearby locations in Kenya.82

Both *Pierolapithecus* and *Kenyapithecus* have many of *Proconsul*'s features but have teeth and faces that resemble those of more modern hominoids. And, in contrast to *Proconsul*, *Kenyapithecus* was probably more terrestrial. It also had very thickly enameled teeth and robust jaws, suggesting a diet of hard, tough foods, or possibly a great deal of grit in the food because *Kenyapithecus* lived mostly on the ground. Whether *Kenyapithecus* is ancestral to the later apes and humans is something of a puzzle because its limbs do not show the capacity for brachiation that is characteristic of all the later apes.83 *Pierolapithecus*, however, has wrists and vertebrae that would have made it capable of brachiation, but also has relatively short fingers like modern monkeys. *Pierolapithecus* probably spent most of its time in trees, walking along larger branches as monkeys do, and also brachiating among smaller branches, as apes do.84 Thus, *Pierolapithecus* is a good candidate for the ancestor of later forest-dwelling apes.

*Proconsul* The bestknown genus of protoapes from the early Miocene.

#### Late Miocene Apes

From the end of the middle Miocene into the late Miocene, the apes diversified and moved into many areas. Fossils are abundant in Europe and Asia, less so in Africa. This does not mean that apes were more numerous than monkeys. In fact, the fossil record suggests that monkeys in the Old World became more and more numerous than apes toward the end of the Miocene, and this trend continues to the present day.

One well-known late Miocene ape from Europe is *Oreopithecus*, which dates from about 8 million years ago. It is particularly interesting because, despite being well represented by fossils, including nearly complete ones preserved in beds of hard coal, its classification is enigmatic. *Oreopithecus* was clearly adapted to life in thickly forested marshlands. It had extremely long arms and hands and mobile joints, and was likely an agile brachiator. Its dentition suggests it had a diet that consisted mostly of leaves. However, the dentition and skull of *Oreopithecus* also had a number of unique features that suggest affinity to some Old World monkeys. In short, *Oreopithecus* had an apelike body and a monkeylike head. Because of its suspensory locomotion and other apelike features, most scholars today consider it an early, albeit specialized, ape.85

Most paleoanthropologists divide the later Miocene apes into at least two main groups: the sivapithecids, represented primarily by the genus *Sivapithecus* and found primarily in western and southern Asia, and the dryopithecids, represented primarily by the genus *Dryopithecus* and found primarily in Europe.

Sivapithecids At one time, **Sivapithecus**, which dates from roughly 13 million to 8 million years ago, was thought to be ancestral to hominins. It had flat and thickly enameled molars, smaller canines, and less sexual dimorphism than other Miocene apes, and had a parabolic dental arcade in some reconstructions (now considered faulty)—all hominin features. It also lived in a mixed woodland–grassland environment. However, as more fossil material was uncovered, scholars recognized that *Sivapithecus* was remarkably similar to the modern orangutan in the face, and it is now thought to be ancestral to the orangutan.86

Dryopithecids **Dryopithecus**, which appears about 15 million years ago, was a chimpanzee-sized ape that lived in the forests of Eurasia. It was mainly arboreal and apparently omnivorous. *Dryopithecus* had thinner tooth enamel than *Sivapithecus*, lighter jaws, and pointed molar cusps. In the palate, jaw, and midface, *Dryopithecus* looked like the African apes and humans. In contrast to later hominoids, however, *Dryopithecus* had a very short face and a relatively small brow ridge.87

The fingers and elbows of *Dryopithecus* and *Sivapithecus* suggest that they were much more capable of suspending themselves than were earlier hominoids. *Sivapithecus* may have moved about more on the ground than *Dryopithecus*, but both were probably mostly arboreal.88 Indeed, recent finds of *Dryopithecus* hand, arm, shoulder, and leg bones strongly suggest that *Dryopithecus* was highly efficient at suspensory locomotion and probably moved through the trees like modern orangutans do.

It is still very difficult to identify the particular evolutionary lines leading from the Miocene apes to modern apes and humans. Only the orangutans have been linked to a late Miocene ape genus, *Sivapithecus*, so presumably that lineage continued into modern times.89 *Dryopithecus* disappears from the fossil record after about 10 million years ago, leaving no descendants, perhaps because less rainfall and more seasonality reduced the forests where they lived.90

#### 5.7 Discuss the challenges to identifying any clear emergence of hominins.

## The Divergence of Hominins from the Other Hominoids

The later Miocene apes are best known from Europe and Asia. Until recently, there has been an almost complete lack of African fossil hominoids dating between 13.5 million and 5 million years ago.91 Recently, two species, *Orrorin tugenensis*, from Kenya and dated to about 6 million years ago, and *Sahelanthropus tchadensis*, from Chad and dated to perhaps 7 million years ago, have provided a glimpse of hominoid evolution during this time period. Still, this scarcity of fossils from 13.5 to 5 million years ago is unfortunate for our

*Sivapithecus* A genus of ape from the later Miocene known for its thickly enameled teeth, suggesting a diet of hard, tough, or gritty items. Found primarily in western and southern Asia and now thought to be ancestral to orangutans.

**Dryopithecus** Genus of ape from the later Miocene found primarily in Europe. It had thin tooth enamel and pointed molar cusps very similar to those of the fruit-eating chimpanzees of today.

understanding of human evolution because the earliest unambiguous bipedal primates (hominins) appear in Africa near the beginning of the Pliocene, after 5 million years ago. To understand the evolutionary links between the apes of the Miocene and the hominins of Africa, we need more fossil evidence from late Miocene times in Africa.

# Summary and Review

## Common Primate Traits

5.1 Identify common primate traits.

- • No one trait is unique to primates. However, primates do share a distinct complex of features that include skeletal, dietary, sensory, brain, and developmental elements.
- • Specific shared features include two bones in the lower part of the leg and in the forearm, a collarbone, omnivorous eating patterns, flexible prehensile hands, forward-facing eyes and stereoscopic vision, a large brain relative to body size, long maturation of the young, and a high degree of dependence on social life and learning.

What traits are common to all primates?

## The Various Living Primates

5.2 Describe the major types of living primates and their geographical distribution.

- • The order Primates is divided into two suborders: the prosimians, including lemur forms (Madagascar and the Comoro Islands, off the southeastern coast of Africa), loris forms (in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa), and tarsiers (the islands of the Philippines and Indonesia), and the anthropoids.
- • Prosimians more resemble other mammals and typically have mobile ears, whiskers, longer snouts, relatively fixed facial expressions, and more dependence on smell for information than other primates. But they share with anthropoids grasping hands, stereoscopic vision, and enlarged visual centers in the brain.
- • Anthropoids (humans, apes, and monkeys) have rounded braincases; reduced, nonmobile outer ears; and relatively small, flat faces instead of muzzles. They also have highly efficient reproductive systems and highly dexterous hands.
- • The Anthropoid order is divided into two main groups: platyrrhines and catarrhines. Platyrrhines

have broad, flat-bridged noses, with nostrils facing outward. The catarrhines are subdivided into cercopithecoids and hominoids.

- • The Hominoids have distinct locomotor patterns, including brachiation, knuckle walking, and bipedalism; high conceptual abilities; and relatively large brains.
- • The Hominoids include three groups: (1) the hylobates, or lesser apes; (2) the pongids, or great apes that include orangutans, gorillas, and chimpanzees; and (3) the hominins (humans).

What are the differences between prosimians, anthropoids, and hominoids?

## Distinctive Hominin Traits

5.3 Describe the traits that distinguish hominins from other anthropoids.

- • The differences between hominins and the other anthropoids show us what makes humans distinctive as a species.
- • Hominins are totally bipedal; they walk on two legs and do not need the arms for locomotion. The hominin brain, particularly the cerebral cortex, is the largest and most complex of all anthropoids. Hominins can move their jaws both vertically and horizontally when chewing.
- • Hominin females are not limited as to when they may engage in intercourse. Hominin offspring have a proportionately longer dependency stage. And in comparison with other primates, more hominin behavior is learned and culturally patterned.
- • The use of tools to make other tools and spoken, symbolic language are uniquely modern human behavioral traits. Hominins also generally have a division of labor in food-getting and food-sharing in adulthood.

Explain three differences between hominins and anthropoids and how those differences may have influenced hominin ability to thrive.

### The Emergence of Primates

5.4 Discuss the emergence of primates in relation to environment and adaptation.

- • The surviving primates—prosimians, New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, apes, and humans—are thought to be descendants of small, originally terrestrial insectivores. However, exactly who the common ancestor was and when it emerged are not yet known.
- • The traditional view of primate evolution was that arboreal (tree) life would have favored many of the common primate features, including distinctive dentition, greater reliance on vision over smell, three-dimensional binocular vision, and grasping hands and feet.
- • The earliest definite primates, dating from the early Eocene, about 55 million years ago, are clearly primates. They are classified into two major groups of prosimians—adapids (lemurlike features) and omomyids (tarsierlike features).

What are two of the environmental factors that may have led to the emergence of primates?

## The Emergence of Anthropoids

5.5 Describe the emergence of anthropoids.

- • Undisputed remains of early anthropoids unearthed in Egypt date from the early Oligocene (after 34 million years ago).
- • Early anthropoids included the monkeylike parapithecids and the apelike propliopithecids. The parapithecids are the earliest definite anthropoid group and may be the ancestors of the New World monkeys.

Discuss how the parapithecids may be ancestral to New World monkeys (platyrrhines).

## The Emergence of Hominoids

5.6 Differentiate between the various early anthropoids and hominoids.

- • During the Miocene epoch (24 million to 5.2 million years ago), monkeys and apes clearly diverged in appearance, and numerous kinds of apes appeared in Europe, Asia, and Africa.
- • From the end of the middle Miocene into the late Miocene, the apes diversified and spread geographically. They were much bigger than earlier anthropoids, and they lacked a tail.
- • Most paleoanthropologists divide the later Miocene apes into at least two main groups: dryopithecids, found primarily in Europe, and sivapithecids, found primarily in western and southern Asia.

Explain what paleoanthropologists considered when trying to classify *Oreopithecus* and *Sivapithecus*.

## The Divergence of Hominins from the Other Hominoids

5.7 Discuss the challenges to identifying any clear emergence of hominins.

• Hominins probably diverged from the hominoids between about 8 million years ago and 6 million years ago, although the timing is difficult to determine because of a paucity of fossils from between 13.5 million years ago and about 5 million years ago.

Which regions would likely be the best sources for evidence of hominin emergence and why?

# Think on it

- 1. How could you infer that a fossil primate lived in the trees?
- 2. We like to think of the human lineage as biologically unique, which of course it is (like all evolutionary lineages). But some paleoanthropologists say that humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas are so similar that all three should be grouped as hominins. What do you think, and why do you think so?
