#### The Frog and the Locust, a Hopi Fable

 $\perp$  One very hot and dry day Paqua, the frog, was singing a prayer to bring rain. Not far away

Mahu, the locust, was singing a prayer for rain, too, for he was getting dusty in the hot weather. Then Mahu heard Paqua and approached the frog to ask what he was doing. Paqua said he was singing because he was hot and wanted it to rain.

"Now isn't that strange," said Mahu. "That's the best thing to do to make it rain, and it's exactly what I do, too."

So Paqua and Mahu sang together. As they sang, they noticed clouds forming. And before long it rained and they were both happy.

Thereafter, they were always areat friends because they saw that they both had the same idea about something.<sup>1</sup>

## Characteristics of Associations

As this Hopi fable must have taught the people who grew up hearing it, sometimes a common purpose is better achieved by joining forces with someone who at first is unfamiliar to you. Indeed, not only are the frog and the locust unrelated, but the frog is also the locust's natural predator. As you now know, human societies everywhere organize themselves into groups at least by families and often by larger kin groups. And most societies have at least some territorial groups such as bands, hamlets, or villages. But humans also form nonkin and nonterritorial groups, which anthropologists call **associations**. In this chapter, we will explore some types of associations found in many societies, the characteristics such groups have in common, and why they might have been formed.

Associations are a variety of nonkin and nonterritorial groups that have several common characteristics:  $(1)$  some kind of formal, institutionalized structure;  $(2)$  the exclusion of some people;  $(3)$  members with common interests or purposes; and  $(4)$  members with a discernible sense of pride and feeling of belonging. Societies differ considerably in the degree to which they have such associations and in what kind they have. In the United States just about all associations are voluntary—that is, people can choose to join or not join. But in many societies—particularly more egalitarian ones—membership is generally nonvoluntary: All people of a particular category must belong. Implicit in the rituals and rules of such associations is a means of maintaining the social order and smooth functioning of the group.

Anthropologists generally distinguish between associations and *interest groups* (to use the terminology of political science). Membership in interest groups is voluntary. Although interest groups may display the general characteristics of associations, they vary considerably in social significance, as well as size. Contemporary society in the United States has an abundance of interest groups, for example, ranging from such national organizations as the Democratic and Republican parties to more local organizations such as college sororities and fraternities.

In addition to whether an association is voluntary or not, another dimension of variation is what qualifies a person for membership. There are two possible kinds of qualifications: those that are achieved and those that are ascribed. **Achieved qualities** are those that people acquire during their lifetime, such as superior skills in a sport or the skills required to be an electrician. **Ascribed qualities** are those that are determined for people at birth, either by sex or because of family background (ethnicity, place of birth, religion, social class). We speak of two kinds of ascribed qualities or characteristics: **universally ascribed qualities**, those that are found in all societies, such as age and sex; and variably ascribed qualities, those that are found only in some societies, such as ethnic, religious, or social class differences.

Table 21.1 shows examples of associations that fit neatly into these criteria. Some associations do not fit so neatly—for example, the criteria that qualify someone for Girl Scout membership include an interest in joining, which is an achieved quality, as well as biological sex, which is an ascribed characteristic.

# Nonvoluntary Associations

Although complex societies may have nonvoluntary associations, such associations are more characteristic of relatively unstratified or egalitarian societies. In relatively unstratified societies, associations tend to be based on the universally ascribed characteristics of age and sex. Such associations take two forms: age-sets and male or female (unisex) associations.

### Age-Sets

All societies use a vocabulary of age terms, just as they use a vocabulary of kinship terms. For instance, as we distinguish among *brother, uncle*, and *cousin*, we also differentiate among *infant, adolescent*, and *adult*. *Age terms* refer to categories based on age, or age-grades. An **age-grade** is simply a category of people who happen to fall within a particular culturally distinguished age range. **Age-set**, on the other hand, is the term for a group of people of similar age and the same sex who move through some or all of life's stages together. For example, all the boys of a certain age range in a particular district might simultaneously become ceremonially initiated into "manhood." Later in life, the group as a whole might become "elders," and still later "retired elders." Entry into an age-set system is generally nonvoluntary and is based on the universally ascribed characteristics of sex and age.

Kinship forms the basis of the organization and administration of most noncommercial societies. In some noncommercial societies, however, age-sets crosscut kinship ties and form strong supplementary bonds. Two such societies are the Karimojong of East Africa and the Shavante of Brazil.

Karimojong Age-Sets The Karimojong number some 60,000 people. Predominantly cattle herders, they occupy about 4,000 acres of semiarid country in northeastern Uganda. Their society is especially interesting because of its organization into combinations of age-sets and generation-sets. These groupings provide the political authority for the society and determine how that authority is exercised.2

A Karimojong age-set comprises all the men who have been initiated into manhood within a span of about five to six years. A generation-set consists of a combination of five such age-sets, covering 25 to 30 years. Each generation-set is seen as "begetting" the one that immediately follows it, and two generation-sets are in existence at any one time. The senior unit—whose members perform the administrative, judicial, and priestly functions—is closed; the junior unit, whose members serve as warriors and police, continues to recruit. When all five age-sets in the junior generation-set are established, that generation-set will be ready—actually impatient—to assume the status of its senior predecessor. Eventually, grumbling but realistic, the elders agree to a succession ceremony, moving those who were once in a position of obedience to a position of authority.

Once initiated, a boy has become a man, one with a clearly defined status and the ultimate certainty of exercising full authority together with his age-set partners. Indeed, a Karimojong is not expected to marry—and is barred from starting a family—until he has been initiated. The initiation ceremony itself illustrates the essential political and social characteristics of the age-set system. Without the authority of the elders, the ceremony cannot be held; throughout the proceedings, their authority is explicit. The father-son

relationship of adjacent generation-sets is emphasized, for fathers are initiating their sons.

The Karimojong age system, then, comprises a cyclical succession of four generation-sets in a predetermined continuing relationship. The *retired generation-set* consists of elders who have passed on the mantle of authority because most of the five agesets within the retired generation-set are depleted, if not defunct. The *senior generation-set* contains the five age-sets that actively exercise authority. The *junior generation-set* is still recruiting members and, although obedient to elders, has some administrative powers. The noninitiates are starting a generation-set. Figure 21.1 illustrates the Karimojong age system.

Shavante Age-Sets The Shavante inhabit the Mato Grosso region of Brazil. As recently as the mid-20th century, the 2,000 or so Shavante were hostile to Brazilians of European ancestry who tried to move into their territory. Although they practice some agriculture, the Shavante rely primarily on food collection. Wild roots, nuts, and fruits are their staple foods, and hunting is their passion.3 The Shavante have villages, but they rarely stay in them for more than a few weeks at a time. Instead, they make frequent community treks lasting 6 to 24 weeks to hunt or collect. They spend no more than four weeks a year at their gardens, which are located at least a day's journey from the villages.

Age-sets are a particularly important part of the lives of Shavante males. Boys emerge from the status of childhood when they are formally inducted into a named age-set and take up residence in the "bachelor hut." An induction ceremony takes place every five years, and boys from 7 to 12 years of age are inducted at the same time. The five-year period of residence in the bachelor hut is relatively free of responsibility. The boys' families provide food for

them, and they go out hunting and collecting when they feel like it. But during their residence, the boys are instructed in hunting, weapon making, and ceremonial skills. At the end of the five years, an elaborate series of initiation ceremonies marks the boys' entry into the status of "young men." The day they emerge from the bachelor hut for the last time, during the final rites of initiation, the entire age-set is married, each to a young girl, usually not yet mature, chosen by the boys' parents. Marriages are not consummated until the girls have matured. When the ceremonies are over, the young men make war clubs, for they are now considered warriors of the community, and they earn the privilege of sitting in the evening village council. But they have no authority at this stage and few responsibilities.

The next stage is that of the "mature men." When an age-set is inducted into this stage, the members begin to experience some authority. Important community decisions are made in the mature men's council. The "mature man" status actually consists of five consecutive age-sets, because new age-sets are formed every five years and each one continues in existence until the death of its members. Among the mature men, the oldest sets are considered senior to the younger ones. Members of the most junior mature men's age-set rarely talk in the council; they assert themselves more as they progress in the system.

In contrast to the Karimojong, who have age-sets just for males, the Shavante also have them for females. Shavante girls are inducted into an age-set when boys about their age enter the bachelor hut, but they belong to the age-set in name only. They do not participate in the bachelor hut, nor do they have their own equivalent; they are not initiated;

and they cannot participate in the village council, which makes community decisions. About the only thing the ageset gives girls is occasional participation with males in a few ceremonies. For Shavante women, then, the age-set system does not function as an association.

#### How Do Male Age-sets and Separate Dwellings Affect the Status of Women?

Cross-cultural research suggests that male age-sets lower the status of women, particularly when they include segregated "male" huts and male councils, as they do among the Shavante. Daphne Spain, who conducted a study of 81 nonindustrial societies included in the Human Relations Area Files database, concluded that the physical separation of men and women, as well as taboos against women's participation in councils and initiation rites, deprived women of cultural knowledge and thus power.<sup>4</sup> Do women have more power in cultures with age-sets that do not segregate the sexes? The answer appears to be ambiguous. Suzanne Epple, who studied the Bashada of Southern Ethiopia, determined that women were identified with their husband's age-sets. The age-sets became part of their social network, as did their kin by marriage. Women and their offspring "belonged" to their

### Unisex Associations

*Unisex*, as used here, has quite a different meaning from its current connotation in contemporary North America, where it signifies something that is suitable for both sexes. We use **unisex association** to describe a type of association that restricts its membership to one sex, usually male. Sex as a qualification is directly related to the purpose of the unisex association. In many male unisex associations, this purpose is to strengthen the concept of male superiority and to offer men a refuge from females. In noncommercial societies, men's associations are similar to age-sets, except that there are only two sets, or stages mature males, who are association members, and immature males, who are nonmembers. Like societies with age-sets, societies with male unisex associations are very likely to have traumatic and dramatic male ceremonies initiating males into the group of "mature men."

In most noncommercial societies, women have few associations, perhaps because the men in such societies are dominant in the kinship, property, and political spheres of life. (There is also the possibility that ethnographers, most of whom were men, have given women's associations less attention than men's associations.) In some partly commercialized economies, such as in West Africa, women's associations are more common.<sup>6</sup> Unisex associations or clubs are also a feature of very industrialized societies. The Boy Scouts and the Kiwanis, the Girl Scouts and the League of Women Voters, are cases in point. Joining these clubs, however, is voluntary; in noncommercial and less complex societies, membership is more often nonvoluntary.

**Mae Enga Bachelor Associations** The Mae Enga are a subgroup of sedentary horticulturalists living in the New Guinea highlands. Anthropologists have paid a great deal of attention to their society because of its practice of sexual segregation—indeed, the strain of active hostility toward women that runs through its culture.<sup>7</sup> It is the custom for Mae men to live in a separate, communal house. Up to the age of 5, a young boy is permitted to live in his mother's house, although he is unconsciously aware of the "distance" between his father and mother. As he grows older, his father and elder clansmen make the distance explicit. It is undesirable, he is told, to be so much in the company of women; it is better that he join the menfolk in their house and in their activities. As the boy grows up, the need to avoid contact with women is made abundantly clear to him. He is told that contact with

#### FIGURE 21.1

The Karimojong age system is composed of four distinct generation-sets (labeled A, B, C, and D in this diagram), which succeed each other cyclically. Each generation-set, in turn, is divided into five age-sets or potential age-sets. The senior generation-set (A) exercises authority. The junior age-set (B), the warriors and policemen, is still recruiting. Generation-set D consists of retired age-sets. Noninitiated and not-yet-born boys constitute the potential age-sets C1 through C5.

menstrual blood or menstruating women, if not countered by magic rites, can "pollute" a man. It can "corrupt his vital juices so that his skin darkens and wrinkles and his flesh wastes, permanently dull his wits, and eventually lead to a slow decline and death."8

Because Mae culture regards a woman as potentially unclean, to say the least, it enforces strict codes of male-female behavior. These codes are designed to safeguard male integrity, strength, and possession of crops and other property. So strict are these regulations that many young men are reluctant to marry. But the elders do try to impress upon the young men their duty to marry and reproduce. The men's association attempts to regulate the males' sexual relationships. The association is said to have several purposes: to cleanse and strengthen its members; to promote their growth; to make them attractive to women; and, most important, to supervise contact between the sexes so that ultimately the "right" wives are procured for the men and the "right" children are born into the clan.

By the time males are 15 or 16 years old, Mae youths have joined the village bachelors' association. They agree to take scrupulous care neither to copulate with a woman nor to accept food from a woman's hands. As club members, they will participate in the *sanggai* rituals. Bachelors, under the supervision of senior club members, go into seclusion, in a clubhouse deep in the forest, to undergo "purification." During four days of "exercises," which are similar in purpose to those of a religious retreat, each youth observes additional prohibitions to protect himself from all forms of sexuality and impurity. For instance, he is denied pork (women have cared for the pigs), and he may not look at the ground during excursions into the forest, lest he see feminine footprints or pig feces. His body will be scrubbed and his dreams discussed and interpreted. Finally, together with the club, now restored to purity and protected at least for a while against contamination, he will participate in organized dances and feasting with his chosen female partner.

The *sanggai* festivals afford the entire clan an opportunity to display its size, solidarity, and magnificence to its enemies, whom on other occasions it fights. Hostility toward women may not be surprising in view of the fact that a man's wife and mother come from neighboring clans (the Mae clan villages are exogamous) perpetually in conflict with his own. Male-female hostility, then, seems to reflect the broader interclan hostility. The Mae have a succinct way of describing the situation: "We marry the people we fight."9

Men's houses, and occasionally women's, are found among many peoples, especially in Melanesia, Polynesia, Africa, and South America. Men's associations generally involve bachelors, although older married men will often come by to instruct the youngsters and pass on the benefits of their experience. In more militant days, men's houses acted as for-

tresses and arsenals, even as sanctuaries for fugitives. By and large, they serve to strengthen, certainly to symbolize, male power and solidarity. As do age-sets, men's clubs often provide ties that cut across and supplement kinship bonds. Hence, they permit a given group of men in a given society to act together to realize mutually agreedupon objectives, irrespective of kin relationships.

Poro and Sande All associations usually have some secrecy, as in social life in general. In the examples we have discussed, many of the details of male initiation ceremonies usually are kept secret. But more secrecy seems to be required in the *Poro* and *Sande* associations of West Africa. The Poro and Sande associations exist in several

languages and are located in what is now Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, and Guinea. In Guinea, the Poro and the Sande have been declared illegal, but in the other countries, they are not only legal, they are an integral part of local political structure. Membership in them is public and nonvoluntary; all men in the community must belong to the Poro, and all women must belong to the Sande.10

Where the Poro and the Sande associations are legal, the community has two political structures—the "secular" and the "sacred." The secular structure consists of the town chief, neighborhood and kin group headmen, and elders. The sacred structure, or *Zo*, consists of the hierarchies of "priests" in the Poro and Sande associations. Among the Kpelle of Liberia, for example, the Poro and Sande *Zo* take turns in assuming responsibility for dealing with in-town fighting, murder, rape, incest, and disputes over land.

In what sense are the Poro and Sande secret? If all adults belong to them, their membership and what they do can hardly be described as secret. Furthermore, anthropologists have not only written about these associations; some have even joined them. Beryl Bellman, who joined the Poro of the Kpelle,11 suggested that what is "secret" about these associations is the necessity for members to learn to keep secrets, particularly about how people are initiated into membership. Only when people learn to keep secrets are they considered trustworthy for participation in political life.

The Poro leadership establishes the place where the initiates will undergo scarification and live in seclusion for about a year (formerly it was three or four years). The boys are taken out of town, where they engage in a mock battle with a *ngamu* (a member of the Poro masquerading as a forest devil), who incises marks on their necks, chests, and backs. These marks symbolize being killed and eaten by the devil, but then the initiates are "reborn." In the initiation "village" outside of town, the boys learn crafts, hunting, and the use of basic medicines. The children of the *Zo* are given special instruction so that they can take over the rituals from their fathers. Some are trained to perform as "devils." At the end of the year, the initiates are given Poro names, by which they will be known from then on. Secrecy is attached to events surrounding the initiates; everyone knows that the boys are not killed and eaten by the devil, but only some can speak of it. For example, women must say that the boys are in the devil's stomach; if they say otherwise, they might be killed in punishment.12

An N'jembe women's group in Gabon initiates young women into the group.

![](_page_6_Picture_6.jpeg)

The initiation of females into the Sande (every seven years or so) also involves taking the initiates into the forest for a year (formerly three years). The girls not only undergo scarification, they also undergo a clitoridectomy, that is, the removal of the clitoris. Like the boys, the girls receive training in adult activities. In the years just before and during the Sande initiation, the women are responsible for the moral behavior of the community. People who commit crimes are first brought before the women. If a man is the accused, he is tried by the Poro *Zo*, but a portion of any fine is given to the women.13

The Poro and Sande *Zo* are held in great respect, and the devils are viewed with fear and awe for the powers they possess. Some authors suggest that fear of the Poro and the Sande strengthens the hands of secular political authority because chiefs and landowners occupy the most powerful positions in the associations.14

Secret associations are common in many areas of the world—the Pacific, North and South America, as well as various parts of Africa—although they may be voluntary organizations in some places. In Africa, according to a recent cross-cultural study, secret associations are usually involved in political activities, as are the Poro and Sande. These activities punish people who, according to the secret society, have committed some wrongs. The fact that the punished people almost never seem to be members of the native elite or foreign rulers supports an observation about the Poro and Sande: They typically strengthen the hand of existing political authority.15

Ijaw Women's Associations Among the Ijaw of southern Nigeria, only women in the northern part of this society are organized into associations. In one northern Ijaw village, there are seven women's associations.16 Once a married woman shows herself capable of supporting a household independent of her mother-in-law, which she does by engaging in marketing and trading, she has to belong to the women's association linked to her husband's patrilineage. Membership in such an association is nonvoluntary; all eligible women must join, and members are fined if they do not come to meetings or arrive late.

The women's associations act as mediators in disputes and impose punishments even in cases that have gone to court. For example, an association may impose fines for "crimes" such as defaming a woman's character or adultery. An association may also adopt rules for proper behavior. Judgments and rules are arrived at by consensus of all the women members. If a punished member does not accept a judgment, the other members might get together and taunt the woman or take some important item from her house and refuse to have anything to do with her.

Some of the larger associations also act as lending institutions, using their cash reserves from fines to lend to members or nonmembers at an interest rate of 50 percent or more. Even a male in debt to the association might be held captive in his own house until he pays his debt. It is no wonder, then, that few resist an association's judgment for long. Although it is not clear why women's associations such as the Ijaw's are common in West Africa, one of the factors that may have been important is the women's participation in marketing and trade, which allows them to be financially independent of men. We shall see in the next section that women are increasingly forming voluntary self-help groups to improve themselves economically.

Why Do Age-sets Exist? Anthropologists are not content to provide descriptions of the structure and operation of human associations. They also seek to understand why different types of associations develop. What may account, for example, for the development of age-set systems? S. N. Eisenstadt's comparative study of African age-sets led him to the hypothesis that when kinship groups fail to carry out functions important to the integration of society—such as political, educational, and economic functions—age-set systems arise to fill the void. Age-set systems may provide a workable solution to a society's need for functional divisions among its members because age is a criterion that can be applied to all members of society in the allocation of roles.17 But it is not at all clear why age-set systems arise to fill the void left by lack of kinship organization. Many societies have kin structures that are limited in scope, yet the majority of them have not adopted an age-set system.

B. Bernardi, in his critical evaluation of Nilo-Hamitic age-set systems, also suggested that age-set systems arise to make up for a deficiency in social organization.18 But, in contrast with Eisenstadt, Bernardi specifically suggested why more social organization

is necessary and what particular deficiencies in the previous form of organization should favor development of age-sets. He hypothesized that age-set systems arise in societies that have a history of territorial rivalry, lack central authority, and have only dispersed kin groups. When all three factors are present, he argued, the need for a mechanism of territorial integration is supplied by an age-set system.

One cross-cultural study suggests that territorial rivalry, as indicated by warfare, may favor the development of age-set systems, but this study found no evidence to support Bernardi's hypothesis that age-sets develop in societies that lack central authority and have only dispersed kin groups.19 So it does not seem that age-set societies are deficient in political or kinship organization. An alternative explanation, which is consistent with the cross-cultural evidence, is that age-set systems arise in societies that have both frequent warfare and local groups that change in size and composition throughout the year. In such situations, men may not always be able to rely on their kinsmen for cooperation in warfare because the kinsmen are not always nearby. Age-sets, however, can provide allies *wherever* one happens to be.20 This interpretation suggests that age-set systems arise *in addition to*, rather than as alternatives to, kin-based and politically based forms of integration.21

# Voluntary Associations

Voluntary associations may be found in some relatively simple societies, but they tend to be more common in stratified and complex societies, presumably because stratified societies are composed of people with many different, and often competing, interests. Consequently, voluntary associations comprise a great variety of organizations from professional affiliations and sports clubs to self-help groups and online chat rooms. Here, we will discuss some examples of voluntary associations that are not as familiar in North American experience.

### Military Associations

Military associations in noncommercial societies may be compared to our own American Legion or Veterans of Foreign War. All such associations exist to unite members through their common experiences as warriors (an achieved criterion), and they perform certain services for the community. Military societies were common among the North American Plains Indians. The Cheyenne, for example, had military associations that were not ranked by age but were open to any boy or man ready to go to war.22

At the beginning of the 19th century, the Cheyenne had five military associations: the Fox, Dog, Shield, Elk (or Hoof Rattle), and Bowstring (or Contrary). (The Bowstring association would be annihilated by the Pawnee in the mid-19th century.) Later, two new associations were established, the Wolf and Northern Crazy Dogs. These associations may have had different costumes, songs, and dances, but they were alike in their internal organization, each being headed by four important war chiefs.

When Plains groups were confined to reservations, their military associations lost many of their old functions, but they did not entirely disappear. Among the Lakota, for example, warrior societies continue to be an important part of social life because of the many men and women who have served in the military on behalf of the United States in World Wars I and II, Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf. Returning Lakota soldiers continue to be welcomed with traditional songs of honor and victory dances.23

### Regional Associations

Regional associations bring together migrants from a common geographic background. Thus, they are often found in urban centers, which traditionally have attracted settlers from rural areas. In the United States, for example, migrants from rural Appalachia have formed associations in Chicago and Detroit. Many of these organizations have become vocal political forces in municipal government. Regional associations often form even when migrants have come from a considerable distance. For example, in the Chinatowns of the United States and Canada, there are many associations based on districts of origin in China or on a shared surname. Such regional and family organizations are in turn incorporated into more inclusive ethnic associations, as we shall see later in this chapter.<sup>24</sup>

# **Current Research and Issues**

### Why Do Street Gangs Develop, and Why Are They Often Violent?

he street gangs of young people that we read and hear about are a little like age-sets in that their members are all about the same age and generally have a set of values, goals, roles, group functions, symbols, and initiations. Unlike age-sets, however, street gangs are voluntary—though there may be strong social pressure to join—and their members do not "graduate" through life stages together.

Street gangs are also often like military associations in justifying violence, in this case in the defense of gang interests. Violent street gangs have existed in the United States since the 1800s, when the successive waves of immigrants that populated the poorer neighborhoods—Irish, German, Jewish, and Italian—would form rival gangs and vie for dominance on the street. Poverty and peer pressure to identify with one's ethnic group appear always to have been contributing factors but only partially explain why such gangs have developed in the United States.

For example, although poverty exists throughout Mexico, gangs did not develop there. Rather, Mexico had a *palomilla* (age-cohort) tradition; age-mates hung out together and continued their friendship well into adulthood. The Mexican-American barrio (neighborhood) gangs of such cities as Los Angeles, on the other hand, are characterized by their youth, inter-gang violence, and territoriality.

Most youths in poor neighborhoods do not join gangs. The young men who do join gangs appear to be those who are least able to cope with the stresses of their lives in a different country. Many appear to come from households with several siblings and an absent father. Their immigrant families often find only low-wage work, live in the marginalized parts of the city, and face social discrimination. Unable or unwilling to assimilate into a culture that is so different from their own, the young men have difficulty in school and get into legal trouble early. Indeed, the Mexican-American street gangs of Los Angeles are modeled after rival gangs that were formed in prison and subsequently brought to the streets.

Early run-ins with the law and prison culture may explain some of the violence of street gangs. Some scholars also suggest that the need to show exaggerated "masculine" behavior is a response to the absence of male models in the household. If aggressiveness is part of the male role (e.g., until recently only males were allowed to engage in military combat), then a young man who wants to exhibit his masculinity may be extremely aggressive. And gang culture reinforces aggression. Initiates to Mexican-American gangs are usually expected to endure ritual beatings. As happens in most initiation ceremonies, the gang initiate identifies

even more strongly with the group afterward and comes to believe that he belongs to something important. This is a kind of psychological adjustment, but is it adaptive? Does being in a gang help such youths survive in a neighborhood where young men are often killed? Or are gang members less likely to survive? We need much more research to uncover why gangs develop more often in some societies than in others and why they are often violent. Perhaps we also need to look beyond the violence.

Gang cultures are not all the same. For example, in a study of Mexican-American girl gangs—and their male alter-egos—in a Los Angeles high school, gangs seem to vary just as cliques formed by North American teenagers; there were jocks and rebels, studious groups and "bad" girls, assimilators and proud outsiders. Gangs self-identified by their town or region of origin, whether they had been rural or urban Mexicans, their dialects, and their socio-economic status. And they were quick to pick out impostors (those who did not truly fit a gang's profile). Studies of these variations in gang cultures and the traits of those who join may also help us better understand those that employ violence and those that do not.

William Mangin described the role of regional associations in helping rural migrants adapt to urban life in Lima, Peru.<sup>25</sup> During the 1950s, Mangin studied a group of migrants from the rural mountains, the serranos from Ancash. Typically these serranos, about 120,000 in number, lived in a slumlike urban settlement called a *barriada*. The settlement was not officially recognized either by the national government or the city authorities. Accordingly, it lacked all usual city services, such as water supply, garbage removal, and police protection. Its inhabitants had left their rural birthplaces for the social and economic reasons typical of such population movements, wherever they occur. Most had migrated because of population and land pressure, but the higher expectations associated with the big city—better education, social mobility, wage labor—were also compelling considerations.

The *serranos* from Ancash typically formed a regional association. Club membership was open to both sexes. Men generally controlled the executive positions, and club leaders were often men who had achieved political power in their hometowns. Women, who had relatively less economic and social freedom, nevertheless played an important part in club activities.

The *serrano* regional association performed three main services for its members. First, it lobbied the central government on matters of community importance—for example, the supplying of sewers, clinics, and similar public services. A club member had to follow a piece of legislation through the channels of government to make certain it was not forgotten or abandoned. Second, the *serrano* association assisted in acculturating newly arrived *serranos* to the urban life in Lima. The most noticeable rural traits—coca chewing, hairstyle, and clothing peculiarities—were the first to disappear, with the men generally able to adapt faster than the women. The association also provided opportunities for fuller contact with the national culture. And finally, the group organized social activities such as fiestas, acted as the clearinghouse for information transmitted to and from the home region, and supplied a range of other services to help migrants adapt to their new environment while retaining ties to their birthplace.

The functions of regional associations may change over time as social conditions change. For example, during the plantation period in Hawaii, many Filipino migrants joined hometown associations that served as mutual aid societies. As more Filipinos went to Hawaii, however, more people had kin to whom they could turn. Hometown associations continue to have some economic functions, such as assistance in times of emergency, serious illness, or death, and some scholarship aid, but meetings are infrequent and most members do not attend. Those members who are active seem to want the recognition and prestige that can be attained through leadership positions in the hometown association, which is much more than they can achieve in the wider Hawaiian arena.26

Although regional clubs may help to integrate their members into a more complex urban or changing environment, the presence of many such groups may increase divisiveness and rivalry among groups. In some areas, the smaller groups have banded together and become quite powerful. For example, within each Chinatown of a major U.S. or Canadian city, the various regional and family associations formed a larger Chinese Benevolent Association.27 Thus, by banding together, the regional and family associations formed ethnic associations (see the box on Ethnic Associations in Chinatowns).

### Ethnic Associations

Various types of ethnic associations or interest groups are found in cities all over the world. (It is sometimes difficult to say whether a particular association is ethnic or regional in origin; it may be both.) Membership in these associations is based largely on ethnicity. Ethnic associations are particularly widespread in the urban centers of West Africa. There, accelerated cultural change, reflected in altered economic arrangements, technological advances, and new urban living conditions, has weakened kinship relations and other traditional sources of support and solidarity.28

*Tribal unions* are frequently found in Nigeria and Ghana. These are typical of most such associations in that they are extraterritorial—that is, they recruit members who have left their tribal locations; also, they have a formal constitution, and they have been formed to meet certain needs arising out of the conditions of urban life. One such need is to keep members in touch with their traditional culture. The Ibo State Union, for example, in addition to providing mutual aid and financial support in case of unemployment, sickness, or death, performs the service of "fostering and keeping alive an interest in tribal song, history, language and moral beliefs and thus maintaining a person's attachment to his native town or village."29 Some tribal unions collect money to improve conditions in their ancestral homes. Education, for example, is an area of particular concern. Others publish newsletters that report members' activities. Most unions have a young membership that exercises a powerful democratizing influence in tribal councils, and the organizations provide a springboard for those with national political aspirations.

West African occupational clubs also fall into the ethnic category. African versions of trade unions are organized along tribal as well as craft lines, and their principal concern is the status and remuneration of their members as workers. The Motor Drivers' Union of Keta, in Ghana, was formed to fund insurance and legal costs, to contribute to medical care in case of accident or illness, and to help pay for funeral expenses.

So-called friendly societies differ from tribal unions in that their primary objective is mutual aid. Such a society was formed by the wives of Kru migrants in Freetown, Sierra Leone.

# **Migrants and Immigrants**

![](_page_11_Picture_2.jpeg)

hen immigrants arrive in a new country, they often first live in urban neighborhoods that contain people from the same regions and even from the same towns and villages. These neighborhoods are called "Chinatowns," "Korea Towns," and the like. Such neighborhoods often have associations, nonkin and nonterritorial groups that protect their members in a variety of ways, which is probably why people wanted to live in them in the first place. R. H. Thompson points out the serious sense of mission of ethnic associations: According to its constitutions, the Chinese Benevolent Association in Victoria, British Columbia (which is a ferry ride from Vancouver), was established "to undertake social welfare, to settle disputes, to aid the poor and the sick, to eliminate evils within the community, and to defend the community against external threat."

Many Chinatowns grew up in the United States and Canada since the mid-19th century. After perhaps laboring first on the railroads, work for which they were recruited to come to North America, Chinese immigrants would settle in San Francisco or Vancouver. Some people migrated eastward to the urban centers of New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Montreal, and Toronto. Often, they joined an association of people with the same

![](_page_11_Picture_5.jpeg)

surname. The members considered themselves vaguely related, though they usually could not trace how or even if they were related. Or else the neighborhood contained people from the same district in China, with the same dialect. Most if not all "Chinatowns" continue to exist, even if subsequent generations have moved away from them. Suburban Chinese-Americans often travel to a Chinatown on the weekend to visit with relatives and to shop for

traditional foods. (Like Chinese-Americans, most immigrants retain their food preferences for generations.)

The earliest Chinese immigrants established themselves in small businesses, such as hand laundries, restaurants, and grocery stores. Such businesses were cheap to start up, and family members could provide the labor for little pay. Hand laundries were the first to disappear as the immigrants and their descendants prospered and as many people in the general population started to do their laundry in machines at home or in a nearby "Laundromat." Now, instead of working in the old family businesses, the descendants of people who used to live in Chinatown often go to college and become doctors and other professionals.

Upward mobility often means geographic mobility: People often have to chase the job rather than stay close to home if they want to maximize their income. Among many immigrant groups, not just the people from "Chinatown," ethnic associations lose their attraction and value as people move away from the old neighborhood. Such associations can decline in a generation or two.

Kru men normally go to sea, which is still a hazardous occupation. The club is classified into three grades. An admission fee permits entry into the lowest grade. Elevation to higher grades depends on further donations. At the death of a member or her husband, the family receives a lump sum commensurate with her status in the club. $^{30}$ 

### Rotating Credit Associations

A common type of mutual aid society is the *rotating credit association*. The basic principle is that each member of the group agrees to make a regular contribution, in money or in kind, to a fund, which is then handed over to each member in rotation. $^{31}$  The regular contributions promote savings by each member, but the lump sum distribution enables the recipient to do something significant with the money. These associations are found in many areas of East, South, and Southeast Asia, Africa (particularly West Africa), and the West Indies.<sup>32</sup> They usually include a small number of people, perhaps between 10 and 30, so that rotations do not take that long. The associations are usually informal and may last only as long as one rotation.

What prevents someone from quitting after getting a lump sum? Ethnographic evidence indicates that defaulting on regular contributions is so rare that participants consider it unthinkable. Once a person joins a rotating credit association, there is strong

social pressure to continue paying regularly. A person who joins does not have to fill out paperwork, as in a bank. All that is needed is a reputation for trustworthiness. There is often a social component to the association. Some have regular meetings with socializing and entertainment.33 A rotating credit association may have one of three types of distribution. In some, a leader may decide the order of rotation, usually making the judgment on perceived need. In others, distribution is based on a random drawing or the roll of dice. The third method is based on who is willing to pay the highest interest.<sup>34</sup>

The principle of a rotating credit association has its roots in traditional sharing systems. For example, among the Kikuyu, related women would work together to weed or harvest each other's fields in turn. When a person had special expenses, such as a funeral, there would be a contribution party, and everyone who came would make a contribution. Nici Nelson describes a very successful rotating credit association that developed in a

squatter area of Nairobi. The founding woman organized a group of women of similar economic status who came from the Kiambu district of Kenya. Early in 1971, the group had about 20 members and then expanded to about 30. In a few years, the founder also started a land-buying cooperative. Although the rotating credit association remained embedded in the cooperative, as members became wealthy enough to have bank accounts of their own it lost its usefulness. It disbanded in the 1990s. At one point, men tried to join, but the women refused to allow it. One woman said: "They will take over and not let us speak in our own cooperative."35

In Ghana, despite 30 years of national banking institutions, most saving methods are still informal. In 1991, an estimated 55 percent of the money in the country was saved informally. Rotating credit associations flourish. Women are more likely to join rotating credit associations than men, and the associations or clubs tend to be sex-segregated. The club names often reflect their emphasis on mutual aid. One club in the Accra Makola Market has a name that translates as "Our Well-Being Depends on Others."36 Most of the savings are used to provide capital for trading activities.

In societies that depend on sharing, saving money is difficult. Others may ask you for money, and there may be an obligation to give it to them. However, if there is a rotating credit association, you can say that you are obliged to save for your contribution and people will understand. Rotating credit associations also appear to work well when people find it hard to delay gratification. The social pressure of the group appears sufficient to push people to save enough for their regular contribution, and the windfall you get when your turn comes is gratifying.<sup>37</sup>

When people move far outside their homelands, they may make even more use of such associations. For example, rotating credit associations in Korea go back to 1633. In the Los Angeles area, Koreans are even more likely to use rotating credit associations, mostly to accumulate sums for business.38

### Multiethnic Associations

Although many voluntary associations draw on people from the same regional or ethnic background, voluntary groups in the modern world increasingly draw members from many different backgrounds. For example, the Kafaina, or *Wok Meri* ("women's work"), associations in Papua New Guinea are savings-and-loan associations that link thousands of women from different tribal areas.39 Originally, smaller groups started as savings associations in particular localities, but links between groups developed as women who married out of a village encouraged a relative back home or in another village to start a "daughter" group. "Mother-daughter" visits between groups can last for three days, as one group

### Do Separate Women's Associations Increase Women's Status and Power?

ome women's associations, like those of the ljaw of southern Nigeria, are reported to have considerable power. Do women generally have more power where they create and join their own associations? We only have a partial answer to this question. In a cross-cultural study, Marc Ross looked at the degree to which women have separate associations that are under their exclusive control and asked whether they increase women's participation in public decision-making and also their access to positions of authority. Ross's data indicate that the answer is no. The presence of separate women's organizations does not generally increase the participation of women in public decision-making, their access to positions of authority, or even their private participation in politics. This is not to say that women in organizations do not have influence. They do, but probably only or mainly within their organizations. The influence of women in their organizations, however, does not carry over into other political arenas.

Of course, we might need to consider other possible factors in future research. Perhaps women's participation in political arenas is more likely if female organizations control important economic resources. Such resources may give women more leverage politically. Also, some types of female organizations may have more power than others; for example, stand-alone organizations may have more power than those that are connected to male organizations. But it is also possible that these additional conditions would not change the basic finding: Separate female organizations—perhaps

because they are separate—do not have any impact on women's participation in other political arenas.

Recently, people in the United States have started to discuss a related issue, the possible effects of female "separateness" on women's success. For example, do separate math and science classes for women lead to more equality between women and men in academic performance, in obtaining advanced degrees in math and science, and in access to highpaying positions in those areas? It is well known that women are very underrepresented in the math and physical science professions in the United States. Even though the percentages have been increasing, in 2008, women obtained only 39 percent of the doctorates in the so-called STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Yet they earned more doctorates than men in biology. These differences could be mostly a result of social conditions that discourage females in various subjects and professions. Researchers have found that when boys give wrong answers, teachers are apt to challenge them; when girls give wrong answers, teachers tend to express sympathy. Boys are more likely to operate scientific equipment; girls are more likely to take notes. In the seventh grade, girls perform similarly to boys in math and science, but girls display less confidence in their abilities. By the time they graduate from high school, women have taken fewer math and science courses, so they are at a disadvantage for continuing in those fields.

Because current research suggests that girls do best in learning science and math without boys, some researchers have advocated separate math and science classes and clubs. So, for example, voluntary girls' clubs (Operation SMART) have been set up in 240 locations to interest elementary and junior high school girls in science. Many of the girls in those clubs now say they want to go into science. Whether they stay in science, or how well they do if they stay, is not yet clear. But if these programs work, we would have to conclude that "separate" is more equal than "together."

The two situations we have described here do not seem to be parallel in their effects on women's status. Separate women's associations by themselves do not make for equality between the genders in political participation. But separate training for girls in math and science may make for more equality. What is different about the two situations? At least one thing is different. Separate women's associations in noncommercial societies are usually nonvoluntary; women more or less have to join because that's how the society structures what women can do. Separate training for females in math and science is usually voluntary; girls may opt for the separateness to acquire the skills and the confidence they need to move into arenas open to both genders. In other words, when achievement and not gender defines how far you can go, temporary separateness for women might increase the likelihood of gender equality in professions that do not have it now.

hosts another and the groups exchange money. All money received from another group is placed in a net bag that is hidden and cannot be touched, so the savings grow over time. When a group accumulates a certain amount, a building the size of a men's house is built for the association and a very large ceremony is held.

Does the development of these women's associations translate into new power for women in their traditionally male-dominated societies? That has yet to happen (see the box "Do Separate Women's Associations Increase Women's Status and Power?"). Apparently frustrated by their exclusion from local politics, the women are increasingly participating

in the Kafaina movement. They may have intergroup exchanges, and they may now engage in public speaking, but so far their arena is still separate from the men's arena.

Just as the Kafaina women's associations seem to be a response to perceived deprivation, the formation of associations with multiethnic or regional membership is not unusual where colonialism or other political domination is recognized as a common problem. For example, in Alaska in the 1960s, Native Americans felt threatened by proposals for economic development that they thought would threaten their subsistence resources. Many regional and ethnic associations formed during this crisis, but perhaps more significant from the point of view of achieving substantial compensation and titles to land was the formation of a pan-Alaska association called the Alaska Federation of Natives. What made the amalgamation possible? Like the leaders of multiethnic movements in many places, the leaders at the highest levels seem to have had a lot of things in common. They were educated urban dwellers with professional occupations. Perhaps most important, many of them had attended the same schools.40

Multiethnic and multiregional associations have often been involved in independence movements throughout the world. Often, revolutionary political parties develop out of such associations and lead the efforts to gain independence. Why independence movements develop in some places but not in others is not yet understood.

### Other Interest Groups

Societies such as the United States consist of people from many different ethnic backgrounds. Often there are voluntary ethnic and regional associations. But the majority of the voluntary associations in our own and other complex societies have members who belong because of common, achieved interests. These common interests include occupation (so we have trade unions and professional associations), political affiliation (as in national political parties and political action groups), recreation (sports and game clubs, fan clubs, music and theater groups), charities, and social clubs. The larger and more diversified the society, the more different kinds of associations there are. They bring together people with common interests, aspirations, or qualifications, and they provide opportunities to work for social causes, for self-improvement, or to satisfy a need for new and stimulating experiences. We join clubs and other interest groups because we want to achieve particular goals. Not the least of such goals is identification with a "corporate" group and, through it, the acquisition of status and influence.

Joining clubs is much more important in some societies than in others. Norway is an example of a society with a rich organizational life. Even in areas with small communities, there are many different clubs. For example, Douglas Caulkins found that in the municipality of Volda, a town of about 7,000, there were 197 organizations. People were expected to be active in at least a couple of organizations, and these groups met regularly. In fact, there were so many meetings that organizations were expected to coordinate their calendars so that the meetings would not interfere with one another.41 Why some societies, like Norway, have so much involvement with voluntary associations is not well understood. Nor do we understand what the consequences of such involvement may be. Norway happens to have a particularly low crime rate, and it scores high on other indicators of social and economic health.42 Does the complexity of its organizational life and its many overlapping involvements play a role in its social health? We don't know, because cross-cultural studies to test that possibility have not been done.

Why Do Voluntary Associations Exist? It is difficult to say why voluntary associations arise whose membership is variably ascribed—that is, determined at birth but not found in all people of a given age-sex category. We know that voluntary associations of all types become more numerous, and more important, as the society harboring them advances in technology, complexity, and scale. No definitive explanation of this phenomenon is yet available, but the following trends seem to be sufficiently established to merit consideration.

First, there is urbanization. Developing societies are becoming urban, and as their cities grow, so does the number of people separated from their traditional kinship ties and local customs. It is not surprising, then, that the early voluntary associations should be mutual aid societies, established first to take over kin obligations in case of death and later broadening their benefits in other directions. In this respect, the recent associations of the developing African societies closely resemble the early English laboring-class associations. Those clubs also served to maintain the city migrants' contacts with former traditions and culture. The regional associations in Latin America resemble the regional associations of European immigrants in the United States. Such associations also seem to arise in response to the migrants' or immigrants' needs in the new home.

Second, there is an economic factor. Migrants and immigrants try to adapt to new economic conditions, and group interests in the new situations have to be organized, promoted, and protected.

Why, then, do variably ascribed associations tend to be replaced by clubs of the achieved category in highly industrialized societies? Perhaps the strong focus on specialization in industrialized societies is reflected in the formation of specialized groups. Possibly the emphasis on achievement in industrialized societies is another contributing factor. Perhaps, too, the trend toward uniformity, encouraged by mass marketing and the mass media, is progressively weakening the importance of regional and ethnic distinctions. The result seems to be that the more broadly based organizations are being replaced by more narrowly based associations that are more responsive to particular needs not being met by the institutions of mass society.

The proliferation of social media has led some commentators to suggest that face-toface voluntary associations may in time give way to virtual communities. Robert Putnam sounded the alarm 15 years ago—when social media was still in its infancy—that civil

## **Applied Anthropology**

### NGOs: Powerful National and International Interest Groups in the Modern World

he associations discussed so far in this chapter are mostly local organizations. Their activities and influence do not affect whole societies, and they have little or no effect on the economic and political state of the world. Even large modern voluntary organizations such as political parties, trade unions, and professional societies, powerful as they are in their own society, do not directly influence international relations and the fortunes of other societies. But there is a relatively new type of interest group that does—what we call nongovernmental organizations, or NGOs. Many anthropologists work for them, applying anthropological findings and understanding to the solution of practical problems. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund are two well-known examples that employ anthropologists and other social scientists to foster national and international economic development.

One of the main lessons of this chapter is that associations, nonkin and nonterritorial organizations, appear to develop to satisfy social needs that cannot easily be satisfied otherwise. For example, if you cannot depend on

kin to defend against a raid because the members of your kin group are dispersed, you can turn to members of your age-set, some of whom will always be nearby and can more quickly come to your defense. If you cannot exert enough pressure on your employer to pay decent wages, you may join others in a trade union that negotiates with you. An association of nations (the UN, or military alliances such as NATO) can organize responses to international threats. And it appears that NGOs operating in different countries make war less likely between those countries. The presence of the NGO seems to encourage peace between the countries as much as shared democratic institutions and economic interdependence.

NGOs are powerful interest groups in the modern world probably because the political states of the world cannot always agree on what should be done to resolve disputes and mitigate global problems. Or they cannot arrange for the necessary funding. But organizations that can raise money privately and from interested business organizations can work (often behind the scenes) to get things done. They

can direct investments in new activities. as the World Bank does. Think of how the American colonies first organized to resist British rule. The Declaration of Independence marked the emergence of a large-scale association that was not a kin group and not (at least to begin with) a territorial organization. The formation of a unified state, the "United States of America," was still to come.

During the 1990s, the number of NGOs rose from 6,000 to more than 25,000. Today there are over 56,000 NGOs that operate internationally. National NGOs are far greater in number. The United States alone currently has about 1.5 million NGOs, according the State Department. The attention these organizations attract and the influence they exert mean that they are doing some things that need to get done, and that could not get done otherwise. As much as they sometimes deserve criticism, the increasing number of NGOs may be a predictor of the growing unification of the world.

society was endangered by the decline of such community civic organizations as labor unions, parent-teacher associations, and volunteer and fraternal organizations. He noted that people still went bowling, for instance, but that they bowled alone instead of in bowling leagues. Blaming television and other media, women's increased entry into the workforce, greater mobility, and demographic changes, Putnam worried that social and political engagement could be endangered.43 He may have spoken too soon, judging from the trends we are seeing in social media!

# Summary and Review

### Characteristics of Associations

21.1 Explain the characteristics of associations and how they vary.

- • In addition to kin groups and territorial groups, humans also form associations, or nonkin and nonterritorial groups.
- • Associations have the following characteristics in common: (1) some kind of formal, institutionalized structure; (2) the exclusion of some people; (3) members with common interests or purposes; and (4) members with a discernible sense of pride and feeling of belonging. Societies differ considerably in the degree to which they have such associations and in what kind they have. In the United States just about all associations are voluntary—that is, people can choose

to join or not join. But in many societies—particularly more egalitarian ones—membership is generally nonvoluntary: All people of a particular category must belong. Implicit in the rituals and rules of such associations is a means of maintaining the social order and smooth functioning of the group.

### Nonvoluntary Associations

21.2 Describe the various forms of nonvoluntary associations and identify their functions.

- • Complex societies may have nonvoluntary associations, but such associations are more typical of relatively unstratified or egalitarian societies, and in those societies associations tend to be based on characteristics of age and sex.
- • All societies use a vocabulary of age terms, just as they use a vocabulary of kinship terms. Entry into an age-set system is generally nonvoluntary.
- • Unisex associations restrict membership to one sex. Membership is often nonvoluntary in noncommercial societies and voluntary in commercial societies.
- • Cross-cultural research suggests that male age-sets lower the status of women, particularly when they include segregated "male" huts and male councils.
- • Age-set systems may arise in societies that have both frequent warfare and local groups that change in size and composition throughout the year.

What are some types of nonvoluntary associations, and what are their purposes?

### Voluntary Associations

21.3 Describe the various forms of voluntary associations and identify their functions.

- • Voluntary associations may be found in some relatively simple societies, but they tend to be more common in stratified and complex societies. Voluntary associations vary widely from professional affiliations and sports clubs to self-help groups and online chat rooms.
- • Voluntary associations that are less familiar to North American culture include military associations, regional associations, ethnic associations, rotating credit associations, and multiethnic associations.
- • The majority of the voluntary associations in complex societies have members who belong because of common, achieved interests, including occupation, political affiliation, recreation, charities, and social clubs.
- • A society's voluntary associations become more numerous and important as its technology, complexity, and scale advances. Urbanization, economic factors, an industrialized focus on specialization, or mass marketing and media may lead to voluntary associations.
- • Social media may give rise to virtual communities over face-to-face communities, which may endanger social and political engagement.

- 3. Many formerly unisex associations have opened their membership to the opposite sex. What might be the results of this change?
