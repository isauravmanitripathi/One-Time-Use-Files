rhaps all of us consider ourselves to be unique, with a set of opinions, preferences, habits, and quirks distinct from anyone else's. Indeed, all individuals are unique, and yet most people also share a set of preferences, beliefs, and habits that characterize the society in which they live. People who live in North America, for example, are likely to feel that eating dog meat is wrong, believe that bacteria or viruses cause illness, and habitually sleep on a bed that consists of a mattress supported on some kind of base. Such shared ideas and behaviors are part of what anthropologists mean when they refer to culture. Most people rarely question their shared assumptions and traits until they encounter others who have quite different beliefs and customs. Thus, North Americans may never consider the possibility of eating dog meat until they learn that it is commonly eaten in some societies. (Likewise, people in some other societies may be equally repelled or consider taboo some kinds of meat that North Americans eat). North Americans may realize that their belief in germs is cultural once they see that people in some societies believe that witchcraft or evil spirits cause illness. They may understand that sleeping on a bed is a custom when they learn that people in many societies sleep on the floor or on the ground and, indeed, cook and converse sitting on the floor or ground. When people start to compare and contrast other cultures with their own to learn how they are different, they are beginning to think anthropologically. In fact, anthropology began as a profession when Europeans began to explore and move to faraway places, and they were confronted with the striking facts of cultural variation.

Anthropologists also want to understand how and why cultures change. Most of us are aware that "times have changed," especially when we compare our lives with those of our parents. Some of the most dramatic changes have occurred in women's roles and in attitudes about sex and marriage. Advances in technology have also led to cultural changes that could not have been foreseen. Culture change is not unusual; throughout history, humans have replaced or altered customary behaviors and attitudes as their needs changed. Just as no individual is immortal, no particular cultural pattern is impervious to change. Culture change may be gradual or rapid. Within the last 600 years or so, the pace of change has accelerated, largely because of contact between different societies. Exploration, colonization, trade, and more recently multinational business, the Internet, and social media have led to an economic and cultural interconnectedness among the world's cultures that we call globalization. Anthropologists want to assess not only the impact of these changes on cultures but what they mean for the future of cultural diversity.

# **Defining Culture**

In everyday usage, the word *culture* had long referred to a desirable quality we can acquire by attending a sufficient number of plays and concerts and visiting art museums and galleries. But today the anthropological meaning of the term may be more common. People now routinely refer to a particular society's culture, such as American culture, a subgroup's culture, such as Chinese-American, or a transcultural phenomenon, such as "youth culture" and "online culture." In each case, *culture* refers, as Ralph Linton explained, "to the total way of life," from the most mundane activities, such as washing dishes, to the more profound aspects of life. From the point of view of the social scientist, then, "every human being is cultured, in the sense of participating in some culture or other."<sup> $1$ </sup>

Linton emphasized common habits and behaviors in what he considered culture, but the totality of life also includes not just what people do but also how they commonly think and feel. As we define it here, **culture** is the set of learned behaviors and ideas (including beliefs, attitudes, values, and ideals) that are characteristic of a particular society or other social group. Behaviors can also produce products or *material culture*—things such as houses, musical instruments, and tools that are the products of customary behavior. In anthropology, all aspects of culture are important.

12.1 Discuss the concept of culture as used in anthropology, its salient properties, and controversies surrounding the concept of culture.

**Culture** The set of learned behaviors and ideas (including beliefs, attitudes, values, and ideals) that are characteristic of a particular society or other social group.

**Society** A group of

people who occupy a particular territory and speak a common language not generally understood by neighboring peoples. By this definition, societies do not necessarily correspond to countries.

**Subculture** The shared customs of a subgroup within a society.

Although groups from families to societies share cultural traits, anthropologists have traditionally been concerned with the cultural characteristics of *societies.* Many anthropologists define a **society** as a group of people who occupy a particular territory and speak a common language not generally understood by neighboring peoples. By this definition, societies may or may not correspond to countries. There are many countries—particularly newer ones—that have within their boundaries different peoples speaking mutually unintelligible languages. By our definition of society, such countries are composed of many different societies and therefore many cultures. Also, by our definition of society, some societies may include more than one country. For example, we would have to say that Canada and the United States form a single society because the two groups generally speak English, live next to each other, and share many common ideas and behaviors. That is why we refer to "North American culture." The terms *society* and *culture* are not synonymous. Society refers to a group of people; culture refers to the learned and shared behaviors, ideas, and characteristic of those people. As we will discuss shortly, we also have to be careful to describe culture as of particular time period; what is characteristic of one time may not be characteristic of another.

#### Culture Is Commonly Shared

If only one person thinks or does a certain thing, that thought or action represents a personal habit, not a pattern of culture. For a thought or action to be considered cultural, some social group must commonly share it. We usually share many behaviors and ideas with our families and friends. We commonly share cultural characteristics with those whose ethnic or regional origins, religious affiliations, and occupations are the same as or similar to our own. We share certain practices and ideas with most people in our society. We also share some cultural traits with people beyond our society who have similar interests (such as rules for international sporting events) or similar roots (as do the various English-speaking nations).

When we talk about the commonly shared customs of *a* society, which constitute the traditional and central concern of cultural anthropology, we are referring to *a* culture. When we talk about the commonly shared customs of a group within a society, which are a central concern of sociologists and increasingly of concern to anthropologists, we are referring to a **subculture**. When we study the commonly shared customs of some group that includes different societies, we usually qualify the term; for example, we may call or refer to the cultural characteristics of societies in or derived from Europe as Western culture, or the presumed cultural characteristics of poor people the world over as the *culture of poverty*.

Even when anthropologists refer to something as cultural, there is always individual variation, and not everyone in a society shares a particular cultural characteristic of that society. It is cultural in North American society, for example, for adults to live apart from their parents. But not all adults in the society do so, nor do all adults wish to do so. The custom is considered cultural because most adults practice it. In every society studied by anthropologists—in the simplest as well as the most complex—individuals do not all think and act the same.2 Indeed, individual variation is a major source of new culture.3

#### Culture Is Learned

Not all things shared generally by a group are cultural. Typical hair color is not cultural, nor is the act of eating. For something to be considered cultural, it must be learned as well as shared. A typical hair color (unless dyed) is not cultural because it is genetically determined. Humans eat because they must; but what and when and how they eat are learned and vary from culture to culture. That food preferences are cultural is especially apparent in which meats a society believes are acceptable to eat. In 2013, the discovery in Europe that ground meat sold as beef also contained horsemeat was greeted with horror. The British, perhaps because they have a high regard for the horse and view horses as pets—that is, with particular familiarity—were especially horrified.4 Yet horsemeat is considered a delicacy in some parts of Europe and Central Asia. North Americans may be slightly less repelled by the idea of horsemeat, but they generally react with the same horror to eating dog meat.

Guinea pigs, another American household pet, are a common meat in the Andes dating back to the Incas and have recently been introduced in a few Peruvian restaurants in the United States.5 Is there less aversion to eating guinea pigs than dogs? It appears that there may be, perhaps because dogs have been domesticated for a very long time and are often "part of the family." There is some culture somewhere that avoids every kind of meat North Americans commonly eat. Muslim, Jewish, and Hindu cultures reject pork meat because of religious laws, although why their religions have a pork taboo is still a matter of debate. Many Cushitic-speaking pastoral groups in northeastern Africa reject fish and disapprove of neighboring groups that eat seafood. Meanwhile, some sub-Saharan pastoralists and some cultures in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands keep cocks to wake them in the morning and raise chickens for spiritual rites, such as sacrifice and divination, but will not eat the fowl or its eggs. Hindus are generally vegetarian but are especially repelled by the idea of eating beef, for they view the cow as sacred.6 What accounts for these food preferences and aversions? We know some of the reasons given: religious taboos, age-old superstitions or myths, unfamiliarity, or too much familiarity. And scholars debate their historical and psychological roots. We only know for sure that they are cultural and therefore learned behaviors.

To some extent, all animals exhibit learned behaviors, some of which most individuals in a population may share and may therefore be considered cultural. But different animal species vary in the degree to which their shared behaviors are learned or instinctive. The sociable ants, for instance, despite all their patterned social behavior, do not appear to have much, if any, culture. They divide their labor, construct their nests, form their raiding columns, and carry off their dead—all without having been taught to do so and without imitating the behavior of other ants. Our closest biological relatives, the monkeys and the apes, not only learn a wide variety of behaviors on their own, they also learn from each other. Some of their learned responses are as basic as those involved in maternal care; others are as frivolous as the taste for candy. Frans de Waal reviewed seven long-term studies of chimpanzees and identified at least 39 behaviors that were clearly learned from others.7 If shared and socially learned, these behaviors could be described as cultural.

The proportion of an animal's life span occupied by childhood roughly reflects the degree to which the animal depends on learned behavior for survival. Monkeys and apes have relatively long childhoods compared to other animals. Humans have by far the longest childhood of any animal, reflecting our great dependence on learned behavior. Although humans may acquire much learned behavior by trial and error and imitation, as do monkeys and apes, most human ideas and behaviors are learned from others. Much of it is probably acquired with the aid of spoken, symbolic language. Using language, a human parent can describe a snake and tell a child that a snake is dangerous and should be avoided. If symbolic language did not exist, the parent would have to wait until the child actually saw a snake and then, through example, show the child that such a creature is to be avoided. Without language, we probably could not transmit or receive information so efficiently and rapidly, and thus would not be heir to so rich and varied a culture.

To sum up, we may say that something is cultural if it is a learned behavior or idea (belief, attitude, value, ideal) that the members of a society or other social group generally share.

#### Controversies About the Concept of Culture

Not all anthropologists define culture as we do here. We have included learned and shared behaviors as well as ideas. Cognitive anthropologists are most likely to say that culture refers not to behaviors but to the rules and ideas behind them, and that culture therefore resides in people's heads.8 Although every individual will have slightly different constructs that are based in part on their own unique experiences, many people in a society share many of the same experiences, and therefore they will share many ideas. It is those shared ideas that cognitive anthropologists describe as culture. Whether or not you include behavior as part of culture, both views of culture assume that there will be individual variation, and it is up to the anthropologist to discern the shared nature of culture. Individual variation is the source of new culture.

Another view of culture is that it is an entity, a force, that profoundly affects the individuals who live within its influence. The most extreme version of this view, one that was more acceptable in the past, holds that culture has a "life" of its own that could be studied without much regard for individuals at all.9 People are born blank slates, it is argued, and culture puts its stamp on in each generation. There are a number of problems with viewing culture as having a life of its own. First, where does it reside exactly? Second, if individuals do not matter, what are the mechanisms of culture change?

People sometimes behave differently when they are in social groups rather than alone. Violent mob behavior is an extreme but telling example. People who would never dream of behaving badly sometimes find themselves doing so to go along with a group. Taking part in a collective ritual that gives a person a feeling of "oneness" is another example of how group behavior can be transformative. If people do or feel things in groups that they would not do alone, we need to look at behavior, as well as the rules or ideas in people's heads, in describing a culture. Therefore, in contrast to many cognitive anthropologists, we define culture as including both behavior and the products of behavior.

# Cultural Constraints

The noted French sociologist Émile Durkheim stressed that culture is something *outside* us that exerts a strong coercive power on us and constrains our actions and beliefs. Because we generally conform to our culture, we are not always aware of being constrained by its standards and rules for acceptable behavior.10 Social scientists refer to these standards or rules as **norms**. Some recent research suggests that people may in fact be biased toward normative information. When a group of undergraduates were asked to read texts about Tikopians, whose culture they knew little about, they were more likely to remember a fact if it was presented as "traditional," "practiced by everyone," or a "custom."<sup>11</sup> The importance of a norm usually can be judged by how members of a society respond when it is violated.

Cultural constraints are of two basic types, *direct* and *indirect.* Naturally, the direct constraints are the more obvious. For example, if you have a loud argument in a restaurant, you are likely to attract disapproval, an indirect constraint, but if the argument turns into a physical fight, you may be arrested for disturbing the peace, which is a direct constraint.

Although indirect forms of cultural constraint are less obvious than direct ones, they are usually no less effective. Durkheim illustrated this point when he wrote, "I am not obliged to speak French with my fellow-countrymen, nor to use the legal currency, but I cannot possibly do otherwise. If I tried to escape this necessity, my attempt would fail miserably."12 In other words, if Durkheim had decided he would rather speak Icelandic than French, nobody would have tried to stop him. But hardly anyone would have understood him either. And although he would not have been put into prison for trying to buy groceries with Icelandic money, he would have had difficulty convincing the local merchants to sell him food.

In a series of classic experiments on conformity, Solomon Asch revealed how strong social pressure can be. Asch coached the majority of a group of college students to give deliberately incorrect answers to questions involving visual stimuli. A "critical subject," the one student in the room who was not so coached, had no idea that the other participants would purposely misinterpret the evidence presented to them. Asch found that, in one-third of the experiments, the critical subjects consistently gave incorrect answers, seemingly allowing their own correct perceptions to be distorted by the obviously incorrect statements of the others. In another 40 percent of the experiments, the critical subject yielded to the opinion of the group some of the time.13 These studies have been replicated in the United States and elsewhere. Although the degree of conformity appears to vary in different societies, most studies still show conformity effects.14 Many individuals still do not give in to the wishes of the majority, but a recent study using MRIs has shown that perceptions can actually be altered if participants consciously alter their answers to conform to others.15

12.2 Describe direct and indirect cultural constraints and how they relate to norms.

**Norms** Standards or rules about what is acceptable behavior.

# Attitudes That Hinder the Study of Cultures

Many of the Europeans who first traveled to faraway places were shocked and offended by customs they observed, which is not surprising. People commonly feel that their own behaviors and attitudes are the correct ones and that people who do not share those patterns are immoral or inferior.16 For example, most North Americans would react negatively to child betrothal, a kind of arranged marriage, but not question their own practice of dating a series of potential partners before selecting one. When we judge other cultures solely in terms of our own culture we are being **ethnocentric**—that is, we hold an attitude called **ethnocentrism**.

Our own customs and ideas may appear bizarre or barbaric to an observer from another society. Hindus in India, for example, would consider our custom of eating beef disgusting. In their culture, the cow is a sacred animal and may not be slaughtered for food. In many societies, a baby is almost constantly carried by someone, in someone's lap, or asleep next to others.17 People in such societies may think it is cruel of us to leave babies alone for long periods of time, often in devices that resemble cages (cribs and playpens). Even our most ordinary customs—the daily rituals we take for granted—might seem thoroughly absurd when viewed from an outside perspective. An observer of our society might justifiably take notes on certain strange behaviors that seem quite ordinary to us, as the following description shows:

*The daily body ritual performed by everyone includes a mouth-rite. Despite the fact that these people are so punctilious about the care of the mouth, this rite involves a practice which strikes the uninitiated stranger as revolting. It was reported to me that the ritual consists of inserting a small bundle of hog hairs into the mouth, along with certain magical powders, and then moving the bundle in a highly formalized series of gestures. In addition to the private mouthrite, the people seek out a holy-mouth man once or twice a year. These practitioners have an impressive set of paraphernalia, consisting of a variety of augers, awls, probes, and prods. The use of these objects in the exorcism of the evils of the mouth involves almost unbelievable ritual torture of the client. The holy-mouth man opens the client's mouth and, using the abovementioned tools, enlarges any holes which decay may have created in teeth. Magical materials are put into these holes. If there are no naturally occurring holes in the teeth, large sections of one or more teeth are gouged out so that the supernatural substance can be applied. In the client's view, the purpose of these ministrations is to arrest decay and to draw friends. The extremely sacred and traditional character of the rite is evident in the fact that the natives return to the holy-mouth man year after year, despite the fact that their teeth continue to decay.*<sup>18</sup>

12.3 Identify attitudes that hinder the study of cultures.

**Ethnocentric** Refers to judgment of other cultures solely in terms of one's own culture.

**Ethnocentrism** The attitude that other societies' customs and ideas can be judged in the context of one's own culture.

Societies vary in their acceptance of an elderly person living apart from family. In the United States and in the UK it is fairly common for an elderly person to live alone or in a facility with non-family members. But in societies where the elderly, such as this great grandmother in central Poland, regularly live with family, having the elderly live alone may be viewed quite negatively.

We are likely to protest that to understand the behaviors of a particular society—in this case, our own—the observer must try to find out what the people in that society say about why they do things. For example, the observer might find out that periodic visits to the "holy-mouth man" are for medical, not magical, purposes. Indeed, the observer, after some questioning, might discover that the "mouth-rite" has no sacred or religious connotations whatsoever. Actually, Horace Miner, the author of the passage on the "daily rite ritual," was not a foreigner. An American, he described the "ritual" the way he did to show how the behaviors involved might be interpreted by an outside observer.

Ethnocentrism hinders our understanding of the customs of other people and, at the same time, keeps us from understanding our own customs. If we think that everything we do is best, we are not likely to ask why we do what we do or why "they" do what "they" do.

We may not always glorify our own culture. Other ways of life may sometimes seem more appealing. Whenever we are weary of the complexities of civilization, we may long for a way of life that is "closer to nature" or "simpler" than our own. For instance, a young North American whose parent is holding two or three jobs just to provide the family with bare necessities might briefly be attracted to the lifestyle of the !Kung of the Kalahari Desert in the 1950s. The !Kung shared their food and therefore were often free to engage in leisure activities during the greater part of the day. They obtained all their food by men hunting animals and women gathering wild plants. Because they had no facilities for refrigeration, sharing a large freshly killed animal was clearly more sensible than hoarding meat that would soon rot. Moreover, the sharing provided a kind of social security system for the !Kung. If a hunter was unable to catch an animal on a certain day, he could obtain food for himself and his family from someone else in his band. Then, at some later date, the game he caught would provide food for the family of another, unsuccessful hunter. This system of sharing also ensured that people too young or too old to help with collecting food would still be fed.

Could we learn from the !Kung? Perhaps we could in some respects, but we must not glorify their way of life either or think that their way of life might be easily imported into our own society. Other aspects of !Kung life would not appeal to many North Americans. For example, when the nomadic !Kung decided to move their camps, they had to carry all the family possessions, substantial amounts of food and water, and all young children below age 4 or 5. This is a sizable burden to carry for any distance. The nomadic !Kung traveled about 1,500 miles in a single year and, understandably, families had few possessions.19

Both ethnocentrism and its opposite, the glorification of other cultures, hinder effective anthropological study.

12.4 Critically assess the concept of cultural relativism.

#### **Cultural relativism**

The attitude that a society's customs and ideas should be viewed within the context of that society's problems and opportunities.

# Cultural Relativism

Early thinkers on human evolution tended to think of Western cultures as being at the highest or most progressive stage of evolution. Not only were these ideas based on poor evidence of the details of world ethnography, they also seemed to be ethnocentric glorifications of Western culture. The influential anthropologist Franz Boas and many of his students—such as Ruth Benedict, Melville Herskovits, and Margaret Mead—rejected the view that cultures progressed through stages of civilization.<sup>20</sup> They stressed that the early evolutionists did not sufficiently understand the details of the cultures they theorized about, nor the context in which these customs appeared. Challenging the attitude that Western cultures were obviously superior, the Boasians insisted that a society's customs and ideas should be described objectively and understood in the context of that society's problems and opportunities. This approach is known as **cultural relativism**. Does cultural relativism mean that the actions of another society, or of our own, should not be judged? Does our insistence on objectivity mean that anthropologists should not make moral judgments about the cultural phenomena they observe and try to explain? Does it mean that anthropologists should not try to bring about change? Not necessarily.

Although the concept of cultural relativism remains an important anthropological tenet, today many anthropologists make a distinction between keeping an open mind when studying other cultures and being morally relativistic—that is, suspending all judgment about behaviors they believe to be wrong. What if, for example, a culture practices slavery, violence against women, torture, or genocide? If the strong doctrine of relativism is adhered to, then these cultural practices are not to be judged, and we should not try to eliminate them. A more measured form of cultural relativism asserts that anthropologists should strive for objectivity in describing a people and should be wary of superficial or quick judgment in their attempts to understand the reasons for cultural behavior. Tolerance should be the basic mode unless there is strong reason to behave otherwise.21 As Michael Brown concludes, cultural relativism is less a comprehensive theory than a useful rule of thumb that keeps anthropologists alert to perspectives in other cultures that might challenge their own cultural beliefs about what is true.<sup>22</sup>

#### Human Rights and Relativism

The news increasingly reports behaviors that Western countries consider to be violations of human rights. Examples range from jailing people for expressing certain political ideas to ethnic massacre. But faced with criticism from the West, people in other parts of the world are saying that the West should not dictate its ideas about human rights to other countries. Indeed, many countries say that they have different codes of ethics. Are the Western countries being ethnocentric by taking their own cultural ideas and applying them to the rest of the world? Should we instead rely on the strong version of the concept of cultural relativism, considering each culture on its own terms? If we do that, it may not be possible to create a universal standard of human rights.

What we do know is that all cultures have ethical standards, but they do not emphasize the same things. For example, some cultures emphasize individual political rights; others emphasize political order. Some cultures emphasize protection of individual property; others emphasize the sharing or equitable distribution of resources. People in the United States may have freedom to dissent, but they can be deprived of health insurance or of food if they lack the money to buy them. Cultures also vary markedly in the degree to which they have equal rights for minorities and women. In some societies, women are killed when a husband dies or when they disobey a father or brother.

Some anthropologists argue strongly against cultural relativism. For example, Elizabeth Zechenter says that cultural relativists claim there are no universal principles of morality but insist on tolerance for all cultures. If tolerance is one universal principle, why shouldn't there be others? In addition, she points out that the concept of cultural relativism is often used to justify traditions desired by the dominant and powerful in a society. She points to a case in 1996, in Algeria, where two teenage girls were raped and murdered because they violated the fundamentalist edict against attending school. Are those girls any less a part of the culture than the fundamentalists? Would it make any difference if most Algerian women supported the murders? Would that make it right? Zechenter does not believe that international treaties, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, impose uniformity among diverse cultures. Rather, they seek to create a floor below which no society is supposed to fall.<sup>23</sup>

Can the concept of cultural relativism be reconciled with the concept of an international code of human rights? Probably not completely. Paul Rosenblatt recognizes the dilemma but nonetheless thinks that something has to be done to stop torture and "ethnic cleansing," among other practices. He makes the case that "to the extent that it is easier to persuade people whose viewpoints and values one understands, relativism can be a tool for change . . . a relativist's awareness of the values and understanding of the elite makes it easier to know what arguments would be persuasive. For example, in a society in which the group rather than the individual has great primacy, it might be persuasive to show how respect for individual rights benefits the group."<sup>24</sup>

12.5 Describe the methods by which anthropologists describe cultures.

If an anthropologist observes dancing in mainstream North American culture, she or he will note that most dancing involves a pair, usually a male and female, but sometimes there are group dances such as the rave as shown here. Yet usually individuals or couples will not simply imitate those around them but will create different patterns of movements and steps.

# Describing a Culture

If all individuals are unique and all cultures have some internal variation, how do anthropologists discover what may be cultural? Understanding what is cultural involves two parts—separating what is shared from what is individually variable, and understanding whether common behaviors and ideas are learned.

To understand better how an anthropologist might make sense of diverse behaviors, let us examine the diversity at a professional football game in the United States. When people attend a football game, various members of the crowd behave differently while "The Star-Spangled Banner" is being played. As they stand and listen, some people remove their hats; a child munches popcorn; a veteran of the armed forces stands at attention; a teenager searches the crowd for a friend; and the coaches take a final opportunity to intone secret chants and spells designed to sap the strength of the opposing team. Yet, despite these individual variations, most of the people at the game respond in a basically similar manner: Nearly everyone stands silently, facing the flag. Moreover, if you go to several football games, you will observe that many aspects of the event are notably similar. Although the plays will vary from game to game, the rules of the game are never different, and although the colors of the uniforms differ by teams, the players never appear on the field dressed in swimsuits.

![](_page_8_Picture_6.jpeg)

Although the variations in individual reactions to a given stimulus are theoretically limitless, in fact they tend to fall within easily recognizable limits. A child listening to the anthem may continue to eat popcorn but will probably not do a rain dance. Similarly, the coaches are unlikely to react to that same stimulus by running onto the field and embracing the singer. Variations in behavior, then, are confined within socially acceptable limits, and part of the anthropologists' goals is to find out what those limits are. They may note, for example, that some limitations on behavior have a practical purpose: A spectator who disrupts the game by wandering onto the field would be required to leave. Other limitations are purely traditional. In our society, it is considered proper for a man to remove his overcoat if he becomes overheated, but others would undoubtedly frown upon his removing his trousers even if the weather were quite warm. Using observation and interviewing, anthropologists discover the customs and the ranges of acceptable behavior that characterize the society under study.

Similarly, anthropologists interested in describing courtship and marriage in our society would encounter a variety of behaviors. Dating couples vary in where they go (coffee shops, movies, restaurants, bowling alleys), what behaviors they engage in on dates, and how long they date before they split up or move on to more serious relationships. If they decide to marry, ceremonies may be simple or elaborate and involve either religious or secular rituals. Despite this variability, the anthropologists would begin to detect certain regularities in courting practices. Although couples may do many different things on their first and subsequent dates, they nearly always arrange the dates by themselves; they try to avoid their parents when on dates; they often manage to find themselves alone at the end of a date; they put their lips together frequently; and so forth. After a series of more and more closely spaced encounters, a man and woman may decide to declare themselves publicly as a couple, either by announcing that they are engaged or by revealing that they are living together or intend to do so. Finally, if the two of them decide to marry, they must in some way have their union recorded by the civil authorities.

In our society, a person who wishes to marry cannot completely disregard the customary patterns of courtship. If a man saw a woman on the street and decided he wanted to marry her, he could conceivably choose a quicker and more direct form of action than the usual dating procedure. He could get on a horse, ride to the woman's home, snatch her up in his arms, and gallop away with her. In Sicily, until the last few decades, such a couple would have been considered legally married, even if the woman had never met the man before or had no intention of marrying. But in North American society, any man who acted in such a fashion would be arrested and jailed for kidnapping and would probably have his sanity challenged. Although individual behaviors may vary, most social behavior falls within culturally acceptable limits.

In the course of observing and interviewing, anthropologists also try to distinguish actual behavior from the ideas about how people in particular situations ought to feel and behave. In everyday terms, we speak of these ideas as *ideals*; in anthropology, we refer to them as *ideal cultural traits.* Ideal cultural traits may differ from actual behavior because the ideal is based on the way society used to be. (Consider the ideal of "free enterprise," that industry should be totally free of governmental regulation.) Other ideals may never have been actual patterns and may represent merely what people would like to see as correct behavior. Consider the idealized belief, long cherished in North America, that everybody is "equal before the law," that everybody should be treated in the same way by the police and courts. Of course, we know that this is not always true. The rich, for example, may receive less jail time and be sent to nicer prisons. Nevertheless, the ideal is still part of our culture; most of us continue to believe that the law should be applied equally to all.

When dealing with customs that are overt or highly visible within a society—for example, the custom of sending children to school—an investigator can determine the existence of such practices by direct observation and by interviewing a few knowledgeable people. But when dealing with a domain of behavior that may include many individual variations, or when the people studied are unaware of their pattern of behavior and cannot answer questions about it, the anthropologist may need to collect information from

Distance between people conversing varies cross-culturally. The faces of the Rajput Indian men on the left are much closer than the faces of the American women on the right.

a larger sample of individuals to establish what the cultural trait is.

One example of a cultural trait that most people in a society are not aware of is how far apart people stand when they are having a conversation. Yet there is considerable reason to believe that unconscious cultural rules govern such behavior. These rules become obvious when we interact with people who have different rules. We may experience considerable discomfort when another person stands too close (indicating too much intimacy) or too far (indicating unfriendliness). Often we interpret that behavior as individual behavior without realizing that the person is actually following his or her cultural rules. Within Europe, for example, there seems to be a gradient from north to south. Northern Europeans tend to stand further apart, and southern Europeans stand closer.<sup>25</sup>

If we wanted to arrive at the cultural rule for conversational distance between casual acquaintances, we could study a sample of individuals from a society and determine the *modal response*, or *mode*. The mode is a statistical term that refers to the most frequently encountered response in a given series of responses. So, for the North American pattern of casual conversational distance, we would plot the actual distance for many observed pairs of people. Some pairs may be 2 feet apart, some 2.5, and some 4 feet apart. If we count the number of times every particular distance is observed, these counts provide what we call a *frequency distribution*. The distance with the highest frequency is the *modal pattern*. Very often the frequency distribution takes the form of a *bell-shaped curve*, as shown in Figure 12.1. There, the characteristic being measured is plotted on the horizontal axis (in this case, the distance between conversational pairs), and the number of times each distance is observed (its frequency) is plotted on the vertical axis. If we were to plot how a sample of North American casual conversational pairs is distributed, we would probably get a bell-shaped curve that peaks at around 3 feet.<sup>26</sup> Is it any wonder, then, that we sometimes speak of keeping

![](_page_10_Figure_6.jpeg)

Frequency Distribution Curve

others "at arm's length"?

Although we may be able to discover by interviews and observation that a behavior, thought, or feeling is widely shared within a society, how do we establish that something commonly shared is learned, and therefore cultural? Establishing that something is or is not learned may be difficult. Because children are not reared apart from adult caretakers, the behaviors they exhibit as part of their genetic inheritance are not clearly separated from those they learn from others around them. We suspect that particular behaviors and ideas are largely learned if they vary from society to society. We also suspect genetic influences when particular behaviors or ideas are found in all societies. For example, children the world over seem to acquire language at about the same age and progress through similar stages. These facts suggest that human children have certain genetic capacities for language acquisition. However, the particular languages spoken by people in different societies show considerable variability. This variability suggests that particular

languages have to be learned. Similarly, if the courtship patterns of one society differ markedly from those of another, we can be fairly certain that those courtship patterns are learned and therefore cultural.

# Culture Is Patterned

Anthropologists have always known that culture is not a hodgepodge of unrelated behaviors and ideas—that a culture is mostly integrated. In saying that a culture is mostly *integrated,* we mean that the elements or traits that make up that culture are not just a random assortment of customs but are mostly adjusted to or consistent with one another.

A culture may also tend to be integrated for psychological reasons. The ideas of a culture are stored in the brains of individuals. Research in social psychology has suggested that people tend to modify beliefs or behaviors that are not cognitively or conceptually consistent with other information.27 We do not expect cultures to be completely integrated, just as we do not expect individuals to be completely consistent. But if a tendency toward cognitive consistency is found in humans, we might expect that at least some aspects of a culture would tend to be integrated for that reason alone. How this pressure for consistency works is not hard to imagine. Children, for example, seem to be very good at remembering *all* the things their parents say. If they ask for something and the parents say no, they may say, "But you said I could yesterday." Such pressure to be consistent may even make parents change their minds! Of course, not everything one wants to do is consistent with the rest of one's desires, but there surely is pressure from within and without to make it so.

Humans are also capable of rational decision making; they can usually figure out that certain things are not easy to do because of other things they do. For example, if a society has a long postpartum sex taboo (a custom in which couples abstain from sex for a year or more after the birth of a baby), we might expect that most people in the society could figure out that it would be easier to observe the taboo if husband and wife did not sleep in the same bed. Or, if people drive on the left side of the road, as in England, it is easier and less dangerous to drive a car with a steering wheel on the right because that placement allows you to judge more accurately how close you are to cars coming at you from the opposite direction.

Consistency or integration of culture traits may also be produced by less conscious psychological processes. People may generalize (transfer) their experiences from one area of life to another. For example, where children are taught that it is wrong to express anger toward family and friends, it turns out that folktales parallel the childrearing; anger and aggression in the folktales tend to be directed only toward strangers, not toward family and friends. It seems as if the expression of anger is too frightening to be expressed close to home, even in folktales.

Adaptation to the environment is another major reason for traits to be patterned. Customs that diminish the survival chances of a society are not likely to persist. Either the people clinging to those customs will become extinct, taking the customs with them, or the customs will be replaced, thereby possibly helping the people to survive. By either process, **maladaptive customs**—those that diminish the chances of survival and reproduction—are likely to disappear. The customs of a society that enhance survival and reproductive success are **adaptive customs** and are likely to persist. Hence, we assume that if a society has survived long enough to be described in the annals of anthropology (the "ethnographic record"), much, if not most, of its cultural repertoire is adaptive, or was at one time.

When we say that a custom is adaptive, however, we mean it is adaptive only with respect to a specific physical and social environment. What may be adaptive in one environment may not be adaptive in another. Therefore, when we ask why a society may have a particular custom, we really are asking if that custom makes sense as an adaptation to that society's particular environmental conditions. If certain customs are more adaptive in

particular settings, then those "bundles" of traits will generally be found together under similar conditions. For example, the !Kung, as we have mentioned, subsisted by hunting wild animals and gathering wild plants. Because wild game is mobile and different plants mature at different times, a nomadic way of life may be an adaptive strategy. Because this food-getting strategy cannot support that many people in one area, small social groups make more sense than large communities. Since people move frequently, it is also probably more adaptive to have few material possessions. These cultural traits usually occur together when people depend on hunting and gathering for their food.

#### Culture Is Imperfectly Patterned

Not all aspects of culture are consistent, nor is a society forced to adapt its culture to changing environmental circumstances. Even in the face of changed circumstances, people may choose not to change their customs. The Tapirapé of central Brazil, for example, did not alter their custom of limiting the number of births even though they had suffered severe population losses after contact with Europeans and their diseases. The Tapirapé population fell to fewer than 100 people from over 1,000. They were on the way to extinction, yet they continued to value small families. Not only did they believe that a woman should have no more than three children, but they took specific steps to achieve this limitation. They practiced infanticide if twins were born, if the third child was of the same sex as the first two children, and if the possible fathers broke certain taboos during pregnancy or in the child's infancy.28

Of course, it is also possible that a people will behave maladaptively, even if they try to alter their behavior. After all, although people may alter their behavior according to what they perceive will be helpful to them, what they perceive to be helpful may not prove to be adaptive. The tendency for a culture to be integrated or patterned, then, may be cognitively and emotionally, as well as adaptively, induced.

12.7 Describe and give examples of how cultures change through discovery and invention, diffusion, and acculturation.

# How and Why Cultures Change

When you examine the history of a society, it is obvious that its culture has changed over time. Some of the shared behaviors and ideas that were common at one time are modified or replaced at another time. That is why, in describing a culture, it is important to understand that a description pertains to a particular time period. (Moreover, in many large societies, the description may only be appropriate for a particular subgroup.) For example, the !Kung of the 1950s were mostly dependent on the collection of wild plants and animals and moved their campsites frequently, but later they became more sedentary to engage in wage labor. Whether we focus on some aspect of past behavior or on contemporary behavior depends on what question we want to answer. If we want to maximize our understanding of cultural variation, such as variation in religious belief and practice, it may be important to focus on the earliest descriptions of a group before they were converted to a major world religion. On the other hand, if we want to understand why a people adopted a new religion or how they altered their religion or resisted change in the face of pressure, we need to examine the changes that occurred over time.

In the remainder of this chapter, we will discuss how and why cultures change and briefly review some of the widespread changes that have occurred in recent times. In general, the impetus for change may come from within the society or from without. From within, the unconscious or conscious pressure for consistency will produce culture change if enough people adjust old behavior and thinking to new. And change can also occur if people try to invent better ways of doing things. Michael Chibnik suggests that people who confront a new problem conduct mental or small "experiments" to decide how to behave. These experiments may give rise to new cultural traits.29 A good deal of culture change may be stimulated by changes in the external environment. For example, if people move into an arid area, they will either have to give up farming or develop a

system of irrigation. In the modern world, changes in the social environment are probably more frequent stimuli for culture change than changes in the physical environment. Many North Americans, for example, started to think seriously about conserving energy and about using sources of energy other than oil only after oil supplies from the Middle East were curtailed in 1973 and 1974. A significant amount of the radical and rapid culture change that has occurred in the last few hundred years has been due to the imperial expansion of Western societies into other areas of the world. Native Americans, for instance, were forced to alter their lifestyles drastically when they were driven off their lands and confined to reservations.

Discovery and Invention Discoveries and inventions, which may originate inside or outside a society, are ultimately the sources of all culture change. But they do not necessarily lead to change. If an invention or discovery is ignored, no change in culture results. Only when society accepts an invention or discovery and uses it regularly can we begin to speak of culture change.

The new thing discovered or invented, the innovation, may be an object—the wheel, the plow, the computer—or it may involve behavior and ideas—buying and selling, democracy, monogamy. According to Ralph Linton, a discovery is any addition to knowledge, and an invention is a new application of knowledge.30 Thus, a person might discover that children can be persuaded to eat nourishing food if the food is associated with an imaginary character that appeals to them. Someone else might then exploit that discovery by inventing a cartoon character named Popeye who acquires miraculous strength by devouring cans of spinach.

Unconscious Invention Societies have various types of inventions. One type is the consequence of setting a specific goal, such as eliminating tuberculosis or placing a person on the moon. Another type emerges less intentionally. This second process of invention is often referred to as *accidental juxtaposition* or *unconscious invention.* Linton suggested that some inventions, especially those of prehistoric days, were probably the consequences of literally dozens of tiny initiatives by "unconscious" inventors. These inventors made their small contributions, perhaps over many hundreds of years, without being aware of the part they were playing in bringing one invention, such as the wheel or a better form of hand ax, to completion.31 Consider the example of children playing on a fallen log, which rolls as they walk and balance on it, coupled with the need at a given moment to move a slab of granite from a cave face. The children's play could have suggested the use of logs as rollers and thereby set in motion a series of developments that culminated in the wheel.

In reconstructing the process of invention in prehistoric times, however, we should be careful not to look back on our ancestors with a smugness generated by our more highly developed technology. We have become accustomed to turning to the science sections of our magazines and newspapers and finding, almost daily, reports of miraculous new discoveries and inventions. From our point of view, it is difficult to imagine such a simple invention as the wheel taking so many centuries to come into being. We are tempted to surmise that early humans were less intelligent than we are. But the capacity of the human brain has been the same for perhaps 100,000 years; there is no evidence that the inventors of the wheel were any less intelligent than we are.

Intentional Innovation Some discoveries and inventions arise out of deliberate attempts to produce a new idea or object. It may seem that such innovations are obvious responses to perceived needs. For example, during the Industrial Revolution, there was a great demand for inventions that would increase productivity. James Hargreaves, in 18th-century England, is an example of an inventor who responded to an existing demand. Textile manufacturers were clamoring for such large quantities of spun yarn that cottage laborers, working with foot-operated spinning wheels, could not meet the demand. Hargreaves, realizing that prestige and financial rewards would come to the person who invented a method of spinning large quantities of yarn in a short time, set about the task and developed the spinning jenny.

# **Current Research and Issues**

#### **Culture Change and Persistence in China**

overnments can change a culture by force, as communist China has tried to do since its inception in 1949. Among the government's revolutionary policies was the push for intensive agriculture and a one-childper-family rule. Yet a study by Burton Pasternak, a U.S. anthropologist, and colleagues from Canada and China suggests that, despite strong pressures from the government, what change persists in a culture mainly reflects what is possible ecologically and economically. The researchers studied four communities of Han who had moved outside the Great Wall to colonize the Inner Mongolian frontier (Inner Mongolia is part of China).

Han farmers who crossed the Great Wall were searching for a better life. Though many found the climate and soil conditions too difficult and returned home, others adjusted to the grasslands and remained. Some Han continued to depend on farming on the fringes of the grasslands. Others farther out on the grasslands became

herders. The Han who switched to herding are now in many respects more like the native Mongol herders than like Han or Mongol farmers. The gender division of labor among the Han pastoralists became much sharper than among the Han farmers because men are often far away with the herds. Pastoralist children. not that useful in herding because mistakes can be very costly, are more likely than farm children to stay in school for a long time. Perhaps because of the greater usefulness of children on the farm, Han farm families have more children than Han pastoralists. But both groups have more than the prescribed one child per family. Herdsmen are less likely than farmers to need cooperative labor, so Han pastoralists are more likely to live as an independent family apart from kin than as an extended family, which was traditional.

Although an increasing number of Han have become more like Mongols

![](_page_14_Picture_7.jpeg)

in their pastoral adaptations, many Mongols have adopted an urban way of life and moved away from their pastoral life. The Chinese government was initially responsible for encouraging non-Mongols to move into Inner Mongolia, particularly into its new capital, Hohhot. At the same time, many Mongols moved from the grasslands and into the capital city. Chinese policy was intended to make each non-Han ethnic group a minority in its traditional land, but the government paradoxically also tried to encourage minority ethnic pride in their traditional culture. The city of Hohhot, therefore, is filled with images of the traditional herding culture in its buildings and monuments.

As described by anthropologist William Jankowiak, who studied the Mongols in the capital city of Hohhot, the results were not what the Chinese government intended. In many ways, to be sure, the urban Mongols had abandoned their traditional culture and assimilated to the dominant Han culture. But we see the force of ecology more than the hand of tradition in the outcome. Many Mongols in the city no longer speak the Mongol language. Parents find it difficult to get children to speak Mongol when they live among Han. The scarcity of housing makes it difficult for the Mongols to form an ethnic enclave or even live near kin as they did in the past. In contrast to life in the rural areas, which revolves around kinship, city life requires interacting with strangers as well as relatives. Indeed, nonkin are often more important to you than kin. As one person said to Jankowiak, "We hide from our cousins but not our friends."

But perceived needs and the economic rewards that may be given to the innovator do not explain why only some people innovate. We know relatively little about why some people are more innovative than others. The ability to innovate may depend in part on such individual characteristics as high intelligence and creativity, and creativity may be influenced by social conditions.

A study of innovation among Ashanti artist carvers in Ghana suggests that creativity is more likely in some socioeconomic groups than in others.32 Some carvers produced only traditional designs; others departed from tradition and produced "new" styles of carving. Two groups were found to innovate the most—the wealthiest and the poorest carvers. These two groups of carvers may tolerate risk more than the middle socioeconomic group. Innovative carving entails some risk because it may take more time and it may not sell. Wealthy carvers can afford the risk, and they may gain some prestige as well as income if their innovation is appreciated. The poor are not doing well anyway, and they have little to lose by trying something new.

Some societies encourage innovativeness more than others, and this can vary substantially over time. Patricia Greenfield and her colleagues describe the changes in weaving in a Mayan community in the Zinacantán region of Chiapas, Mexico.33 In 1969 and 1970, innovation was not valued. Rather, tradition was; there was the old "true way" to do everything, including how one dressed. There were only four simple weaving patterns, and virtually all males wore ponchos with the same pattern. By 1991, virtually no poncho was the same and the villagers had developed elaborate brocaded and embroidered designs. In a period of 20 years, innovation had increased dramatically. Two other things had also changed. The economy was more commercialized; textiles as well as other items were now bought and sold. Weaving was taught in a less directed way. Whereas mothers used to give their daughters highly structured instruction, often with "four hands" on the loom, they were later allowed to learn more by themselves, by trial and error. The result was more abstract and varied designs.

Who Adopts Innovations? Once someone discovers or invents something, there is still the question of whether others will adopt the innovation. Many researchers have studied the characteristics of "early adopters." Such individuals tend to be educated, high in social status, upwardly mobile, and, if they are property owners, have large farms and businesses. The individuals who most need technological improvements—those who are less well off—are generally the last to adopt innovations. The theory is that only the wealthy can afford to take the substantial risks associated with new ways of doing things. In periods of rapid technological change, therefore, the gap between rich and poor is likely to widen because the rich adopt innovations sooner, and benefit more from them, than the poor.<sup>34</sup>

Does this imply that the likelihood of adopting innovations is a simple function of how much wealth a possible adopter possesses? Not necessarily. Frank Cancian reviewed several studies and found that upper-middle-class individuals show more conservatism than lower-middle-class individuals. Cancian suggested that, when the risks are unknown, lower-middle-class individuals are more receptive to innovation because they have less to lose. Later on, when the risks are better known—that is, as more people adopt the innovation—the upper-middle class catches up to the lower-middle class.35 In general, people are more likely to adopt a behavior as it becomes more common.<sup>36</sup>

The speed with which an innovation is adopted may depend partly on how new behaviors and ideas are typically transmitted—or taught—in a society. If children learn most of what they know from their parents or from a relatively small number of elders, then innovation will be slow to spread throughout the society, and culture change is likely to be slow. Innovations may catch on more rapidly if individuals are exposed to various teachers and other "leaders" who can influence many in a relatively short time, and the more peers we have, the more we might learn from them.37 Perhaps this is why the pace of change appears to be so fast today. In societies like North America, and increasingly in the industrializing world, it is likely that people learn in schools from teachers, from leaders in their specialties, and from peers.

Costs and Benefits An innovation that is technologically superior is not necessarily going to be adopted since it comes with costs as well as benefits for both individuals and large-scale industries. Take the computer keyboard. The keyboard used most often on computers today is called the QWERTY keyboard (named after the first letters that appear on the left side of keyboard). This curious ordering of the letters was actually

invented to slow typing speed down! Early typewriters had mechanical keys that jammed if the typist went too fast.38 Since computer keyboards do not have that problem, keys arranged for faster typing would probably be better and have, indeed, been invented. Yet they have not caught on, perhaps because people are reluctant to take the time or make the effort to change.

In large-scale industries, technological innovations may be very costly to implement. A new product or process may require a manufacturing or service facility to be revamped and workers to be retrained. Before a change is made, the costs of doing so are weighed against the potential benefits. If the market is expected to be large for a new product, the product is more likely to be produced. If the market is judged small, the benefits may not be sufficient inducement to change. Companies may also judge the value of an innovation by whether competitors could copy it. If the new innovation can easily be copied, the inventing company may not find the investment worthwhile. Although the market may be large, the inventing company may not be able to hold onto market share if other companies could produce the product quickly without having to invest in research and development.<sup>39</sup>

#### Diffusion

The source of new cultural elements in a society may also be another society. The process by which cultural elements are borrowed from another society and incorporated into the culture of the recipient group is called **diffusion**. Borrowing sometimes enables a group to bypass stages or mistakes in the development of a process or institution. For example, Germany was able to accelerate its program of industrialization in the 19th century through technological borrowing because it could avoid some of the errors its English and Belgian competitors had made. Japan's industrialization followed the same pattern. Indeed, in recent years, some of the earliest industrialized countries have fallen behind their imitators in certain areas of production, such as automobiles, televisions, cameras, and computers.

Diffusion has far-reaching effects. In a well-known passage, Linton conveyed how integral diffusion is to our lives, even while we are largely ignorant about it. Considering the first few hours in the day of an American man in the 1930s, Linton tells us he

*. . . awakens in a bed built on a pattern which originated in the Near East but which was modified in northern Europe before it was transmitted to America. He throws back covers made from cotton, domesticated in India, or linen, domesticated in the Near East, or silk, the use of which was discovered in China. All of these materials have been spun and woven by processes invented in the Near East. . . . He takes off his pajamas, a garment invented in India, and washes with soap invented by the ancient Gauls. He then shaves, a masochistic rite which seems to have derived from either Sumer or ancient Egypt.*

*Before going out for breakfast he glances through the window, made of glass invented in Egypt, and if it is raining puts on overshoes made of rubber discovered by the Central American Indians and takes an umbrella, invented in southeastern Asia. . .*

*On his way to breakfast he stops to buy a paper paying for it with coins, an ancient Lydian invention. . . . His plate is made of a form of pottery invented in China. His knife is of steel, an alloy first made in southern India, his fork a medieval Italian invention, and his spoon a derivative of a Roman original. . . . After his fruit (African watermelon) and first coffee (an Abyssinian plant), . . . he may have the egg of a species of bird domesticated in Indo-China, or thin strips of the flesh of an animal domesticated in eastern Asia which have been salted and smoked by a process developed in northern Europe. . . .*

*While smoking (an American Indian habit), he reads the news of the day, imprinted in characters invented by the ancient Semites upon a material invented in China by a process invented in Germany. As he absorbs the accounts of foreign troubles he will, if he is a good conservative citizen, thank a Hebrew deity in an Indo-European language that he is 100 percent American.*<sup>40</sup>

**Diffusion** The process by which cultural elements are borrowed from another society and incorporated into the culture of the recipient group.

Patterns of Diffusion The three basic patterns of diffusion are direct contact, intermediate contact, and stimulus diffusion.

- 1. *Direct contact.* Elements of a society's culture may first be taken up by neighboring societies and then gradually spread farther and farther afield. The spread of the use of paper (a sheet of interlaced fibers) is a good example of extensive diffusion by direct contact. The invention of paper is attributed to the Chinese Ts'ai Lun in a.d. 105. Within 50 years, paper was being made in many places in central China. Although the art of papermaking was kept secret for about 500 years, it was distributed as a commodity to much of the Arab world through the markets at Samarkand. But when Samarkand was attacked by the Chinese in a.d. 751, a Chinese prisoner of war was forced to set up a paper mill. Paper manufacture soon spread to the rest of the Arab world; it was first manufactured in Baghdad in a.d. 793, Egypt about a.d. 900, and Morocco about a.d. 1100. Papermaking was introduced as a commodity in Europe by Arab trade through Italian ports in the 12th century. The Moors built the first European paper mill in Spain about 1150. The technical knowledge then spread throughout Europe, with mills being built in Italy in 1276, France in 1348, Germany in 1390, and England in 1494.41 In general, the pattern of accepting the borrowed invention was the same in all cases: Paper was first imported as a luxury, then in everexpanding quantities as a staple product. Finally, and usually within one to three centuries, local manufacture began.
- 2. *Intermediate contact.* Diffusion by intermediate contact occurs through the agency of third parties. Frequently, traders carry a cultural trait from the society that originated it to another group. For example, Phoenician traders introduced the ancient Greeks to the first alphabet, which the Phoenicians had themselves received from the Ugarit, another Semitic culture. At times, soldiers serve as intermediaries in spreading a culture trait. European crusaders, such as the Knights Templar and the Knights of St. John, acted as intermediaries in two ways: They carried Christian culture to Muslim societies of North Africa and brought Arab culture back to Europe. In the 19th century, Western missionaries in all parts of the world encouraged natives to wear Western clothing. Hence, in Africa, the Pacific Islands, and elsewhere, native peoples can be found wearing shorts, suit jackets, shirts, ties, and other typically Western articles of clothing.
- 3. *Stimulus diffusion.* In stimulus diffusion, knowledge of a trait belonging to another culture stimulates the invention or development of a local equivalent. A classic example of stimulus diffusion is the Cherokee syllabic writing system created by a Native American named Sequoya so that his people could write down their language. Sequoya got the idea from his contact with Europeans. Yet he did not adopt the English writing system; indeed, he did not even learn to write English. What he did was utilize some English alphabetic symbols, alter others, and invent new ones. All the symbols he used represented Cherokee syllables and in no way echoed English alphabetic usage. In other words, Sequoya took English alphabetic ideas and gave them a new Cherokee form. The stimulus originated with Europeans; the result was singularly Cherokee.

The Selective Nature of Diffusion It is tempting to think that the dynamics of diffusion are like a stone sending concentric ripples over still water, but that would oversimplify the way diffusion actually occurs. Not all cultural traits are borrowed as readily as the ones we have mentioned, nor do they usually expand in neat, everwidening circles. Rather, diffusion is a selective process. The Japanese, for instance, accepted much from Chinese culture, but they also rejected many traits. Rhymed tonal poetry, civil service examinations, and foot binding, which the Chinese favored, were never adopted in Japan. The poetry form was unsuited to the structure of the Japanese language; the examinations were unnecessary in view of the entrenched power of the Japanese aristocracy; and foot binding was repugnant to a people who abhorred body mutilation of any sort.

Not only would we expect societies to reject items from other societies that they find repellent, we would also expect them to reject ideas and technology that do not satisfy some psychological, social, or cultural need. After all, people are not sponges; they do not automatically soak up the things around them. If they did, the amount of cultural variation in the world would be extremely small, which is clearly not the case. Diffusion is also selective because the extent to which cultural traits can be communicated differs. Elements of material culture, such as mechanical processes and techniques, and overt practices, such as physical sports, are relatively easy to demonstrate. Consequently, they are accepted or rejected on their merits. When we move beyond the material world, however, we encounter real difficulties, which Linton (again) aptly described:

*Although it is quite possible to describe such an element of culture as the ideal pattern for marriage . . . it is much less complete than a description of basketmaking. . . . The most thorough verbalization has difficulty in conveying the series of associations and conditioned emotional responses which are attached to this pattern [marriage] and which gave it meaning and vitality within our own society. . . . This is even more true of those concepts which . . . find no direct expression in behavior aside from verbalization. There is a story of an educated Japanese who after a long discussion on the nature of the Trinity with a European friend . . . burst out with: "Oh, I see now, it is a committee."*<sup>42</sup>

Finally, diffusion is selective because the overt form of a particular trait, rather than its function or meaning, frequently seems to determine how the trait will be received. For example, an enthusiasm for women to have bobbed hair (short haircuts) swept through much of North America in the 1920s but never caught on among the Native Americans of northwestern California. To many women of European ancestry, short hair was a symbolic statement of freedom. To Native American women, who traditionally cut their hair short when in mourning, it was a reminder of death.43

In the process of diffusion, then, we can identify a number of different patterns. We know that cultural borrowing is selective rather than automatic, and we can describe how a particular borrowed trait has been modified by the recipient culture. But our current knowledge does not allow us to specify when one or another of these outcomes will occur, under what conditions diffusion will occur, and why it occurs the way it does.

#### Acculturation

On the surface, the process of change called **acculturation** seems to include much of what we have discussed under the label of diffusion because acculturation refers to the changes that occur when different cultural groups come into intensive contact. As in diffusion, the source of new cultural items is the other society. But more often than not, anthropologists use the term *acculturation* to describe a situation in which one of the societies in contact is much more powerful than the other. Thus, acculturation can be seen as a process of extensive cultural borrowing in the context of superordinate-subordinate relations between societies.44 There is probably always some borrowing both ways, but generally the subordinate or less powerful society borrows the most.

External pressure for culture change can take various forms. In its most direct form—conquest or colonialization—the dominant group uses force or the threat of force to try to bring about culture change in the other group. In the Spanish conquest of Mexico, for example, the conquerors forced many of the native groups to accept Catholicism. Although such direct force is not always exerted in conquest situations, dominated peoples often have little choice but to change. Examples of such indirectly forced change abound in the history of Native Americans in the United States. Although the federal government made few direct attempts to force people to adopt American culture, it did drive many native groups from their lands, thereby obliging them to give up many aspects of their traditional ways of life. To survive, they had no choice but to adopt many of the dominant society's traits. When Native American children were required to go to schools, which taught the dominant society's values, the process was accelerated.

A subordinate society may acculturate to a dominant society even in the absence of direct or indirect force. Perceiving that members of the dominant society enjoy more secure living conditions, the dominated people may identify with the dominant culture in the hope that they will be able to share some of its benefits by doing so. Or they may elect to adopt cultural elements from the dominant society because they perceive that the new element has advantages. For example, in Arctic areas, many Inuit and Saami groups seemed eager to replace dog sleds with snowmobiles without any coercion.45 There is evidence that the Inuit weighed the advantages and disadvantages of the snowmobile versus the dog sled and that its adoption was gradual. Similarly, rifles were seen as a major technological improvement, increasing the success rate in hunting, but the Inuit did not completely abandon their former ways of hunting. More recently, the Inuit are trying out GPS devices for navigating.46

Acculturation processes vary considerably depending upon the wishes of the more powerful society, the attitudes of the less powerful, and whether there is any choice. More powerful societies do not always want individuals from another culture to assimilate or "melt into" the dominant culture completely; instead, they may prefer and even actively promote a *multicultural* society. Multiculturalism can be voluntary or may arise out of deliberate segregation. Then, too, even though the less powerful group may be pressured to acquire some of the dominant group's cultural traits, they may resist or even reject those cultural elements, at least for a considerable length of time.

Many millions of people, however, never had a chance to acculturate after contact with Europeans. They simply died, sometimes directly at the hands of the conquerors, but probably more often as a result of the new diseases the Europeans inadvertently brought with them. Depopulation because of measles, smallpox, and tuberculosis was particularly common in North and South America and on the islands of the Pacific. Those areas had previously been isolated from contact with Europeans and from the diseases of that continuous landmass we call the Old World—Europe, Asia, and Africa.47 The story of Ishi, the last surviving member of a group of Native Americans in California called the Yahi, is a moving testimonial to the frequently tragic effect of contact with Europeans. In the space of 22 years, the Yahi population was reduced from several hundred to near zero. The historical record on this episode of depopulation suggests that European Americans murdered 30 to 50 Yahi for every European American murdered, but perhaps 60 percent of the Yahi died in the 10 years following their initial exposure to European diseases.<sup>48</sup>

#### **Development Programs and Culture Change: A Bedouin Case Study**

ost governments of the world today want to "develop" their countries. They want to increase their crop yields and their exports, build major roads and irrigation projects, and industrialize. However, many development schemes have failed in part because they do not adequately consider the cultures of the people whose lives they affect. Governments, as well as international agencies that lend money, increasingly turn for advice to anthropologists to help plan and evaluate projects. While governments may not fully appreciate traditional ways of life, anthropologists understand that people are unlikely to accept a change if it does not integrate well with other aspects of their culture.

In many countries of the Middle East, governments have pressured nomadic Bedouin peoples to settle down. Yet government settlement schemes, by force or with enticements, have also often failed. The Bedouin way of life is essentially at odds with nation states, in which land is increasingly privately owned or converted for industrial uses (such as oil production) and resources are regulated. But Bedouin require vast stretches of grassland and a water source for their herds, resources that were traditionally available to them as members of kinship-based groups that maintained grazing rights over large territories.

Although there are many Bedouin groups in the Middle East and North Africa, they share key cultural traits. They are, as anthropologist Dawn Chatty points out, at once tribal, nomadic, and pastoral. And these three traits are a large part of a Bedouin's identity. When government-built settlements have been created to replace the Bedouin tent, the tribe has often continued its pastoral life near the settlement until overgrazing left a human-made desert or the water supply ran out. The nomadic Bedouin would then abandon such settlements to seek other grazable land and water, and they would again pitch their familiar tents.

Even an enlightened state may find that culture change cannot be imposed on the Bedouin. In the 1980s, Dawn

![](_page_20_Picture_7.jpeg)

The Bedouin still often erect tents in fixed housing settlements as in this Israeli Negev settlement.

Chatty was asked by the government of the Middle Eastern country of Oman to help design a project to extend basic social services to the Bedouin without coercing them to alter their way of life. It isn't often that governments fund indepth studies to try to understand the needs of the people being affected, but Chatty was able to persuade the Oman government that such a study was necessary as a first step. With United Nations funding, she evaluated the needs of the Harasiis pastoralists, a Bedouin group in Oman. Because the government wanted some action right away, the project soon incorporated a mobile health unit that could begin a program of primary care as well as immunization against measles, whooping cough, and polio. After a period of evaluation, the project team also recommended an annual distribution of tents, the establishment of dormitories so that children could live at schools, a new system of water delivery, and veterinary and marketing assistance.

The government was receptive to the recommendations of Chatty's group. Soon a "tribal" complex was built for the Harasiis. It included offices for their government representative, a medical clinic, a school, a mosque, a "reverse osmosis" water plant, a police station, and villas for government employees. But the complex was never occupied. It

appears that the Harasiis would continue to pursue their nomadic way of life.

Yet the Bedouin are not reluctant to change in all respects. As Chatty chronicles, many readily gave up relying on camels for transport in favor of trucks. Trucks are a modern adaptation, yet they still allow mobility. Now the Bedouin are able to get water from wells and transport water to their animals by truck. The adoption of trucks led to other changes. Since small animals can be more readily transported to new pastures by truck, many Bedouin have given up their dependence on camels and shifted to sheep and goat herding. Because money is required to buy trucks and pay for gasoline and repairs, Bedouin spend more time working for wages in temporary jobs. Aside from such adaptations from within, though, they have resisted enforced change. As for Chatty, she views her experience philosophically. She, like other applied anthropologists, has learned a great deal about the environmental and political conditions that impact the world's more marginalized cultures. And she continues to believe that it is her job to push for what Michael Cernea called "putting people first."

Nowadays, many powerful nations—and not just Western ones—may seem to be acting in more humanitarian ways to improve the life of previously subjugated as well as other "developing" peoples. For better or worse, these programs, however, are still forms of external pressure. The tactic used may be persuasion rather than force, but most of the programs are nonetheless designed to bring about acculturation in the direction of the dominant societies' cultures. For example, the introduction of formal schooling cannot help but instill new values that may contradict traditional cultural patterns. Even health care programs may alter traditional ways of life by undermining the authority of shamans and other leaders and by increasing population beyond the number that can be supported in traditional ways. Confinement to reservations or other kinds of direct force are not the only ways a dominant society can bring about acculturation.

The process of acculturation also applies to immigrants, most of whom, at least nowadays, choose to leave one country for another. Immigrants are almost always a minority in the new country and therefore are in a subordinate position. If the immigrant's culture changes, it is almost always in the direction of the dominant culture. Immigrant groups vary considerably in the degree and speed with which they adopt the new culture and the social roles of the new society in which they live. An important area of research is explaining the variation in acculturation and assimilation. (*Assimilation* is a concept very similar to acculturation, but *assimilation* is a term more often used by sociologists to describe the process by which individuals acquire the social roles and culture of the dominant group.)

#### Revolution

Certainly the most drastic and rapid way a culture can change is as a result of **revolution** replacement, usually violent, of a country's rulers. Historical records, as well as our daily newspapers, indicate that people frequently rebel against established authority. Rebellions, if they occur, almost always occur in state societies where there is a distinct ruling elite. They take the form of struggles between rulers and ruled, between conquerors and conquered, or between representatives of an external colonial power and segments of the native society. Rebels do not always succeed in overthrowing their rulers, so rebellions do not always result in revolutions. And even successful rebellions do not always result in culture change; the individual rulers may change, but customs or institutions may not. The sources of revolution may be mostly internal, as in the French Revolution, or partly external, as in the Russian-supported 1948 revolution in Czechoslovakia and the United States-supported 1973 revolution against President Allende in Chile.

The American War of Independence was a colonial rebellion against the greatest imperial power of the 18th century, Great Britain. The 13 colonies owed at least a part of their success in the war to aid from France, which had been waging its own "Seven Years' War" against the British, and more indirectly from Spain, which would also declare war on the greater imperial power. Actually, the American war was closely following what we would now call a world war. In the 19th century and continuing into the middle and later years of the 20th century, there would be many other wars of independence against imperial powers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. We don't always remember that the American rebellion was the first anti-imperialist wars in modern times and the model for many that followed. Just like many of the most recent liberation movements, the American rebellion was also part of a larger worldwide war involving people from many rival nations. A total of 30,000 Germanspeaking soldiers fought, for pay, on the British side; an army and navy from France fought on the American side. There were volunteers from other European countries, including Denmark, Holland, Poland, and Russia.

As in many revolutions, those who were urging revolution were considered "radicals." At a now-famous debate in Virginia in 1775, delegates from each colony met at a Continental Congress. Patrick Henry put forward a resolution to prepare for defense against the British armed forces. The motion barely passed, by a vote of 65 to 60. Henry's speech is now a part of American folklore. He rose to declare that it was insane not to oppose the British and that he was not afraid to test the strength of the colonies against Great Britain. Others might hesitate, he said, but he would have "liberty or death." The radicals who supported Henry's resolution included many aristocratic landowners, two of whom,

George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, became the first and third occupants of the highest political office in what became the United States of America.54

Not all peoples who are suppressed, conquered, or colonialized eventually rebel against established authority. Why this is so, and why rebellions and revolts are not always successful in bringing about culture change, are still open questions. But some possible answers have been investigated. The historian Crane Brinton examined the classic revolutions of the past, including the American, French, and Russian revolutions, and suggested a set of conditions that may give rise to rebellion and revolution:

- 1. *Loss of prestige of established authority,* often as a result of the failure of foreign policy, financial difficulties, dismissals of popular ministers, or alteration of popular policies. France in the 18th century lost three major international conflicts, with disastrous results for its diplomatic standing and internal finances. Russian society was close to military and economic collapse in 1917, after 3 years of World War I.
- 2. *Threat to recent economic improvement.* In France, as in Russia, those sections of the population (professional classes and urban workers) whose economic fortunes had only shortly before taken an upward swing were "radicalized" by unexpected setbacks, such as steeply rising food prices and unemployment. The same may be said for the American colonies on the brink of their rebellion against Great Britain.
- 3. *Indecisiveness of government,* as exemplified by lack of consistent policy, which gives the impression of being controlled by, rather than in control of, events. The frivolous arrogance of Louis XVI's regime and the bungling of George III's prime minister, Lord North, with respect to the problems of the American colonies are examples.
- 4. *Loss of support of the intellectual class.* Such a loss deprived the prerevolutionary governments of France and Russia of any avowed philosophical support and led to their unpopularity with the literate public.55

The classic revolutions of the past occurred in countries that were industrialized only incipiently at best. For the most part, the same is true of the rebellions and revolutions in recent years; they have occurred mostly in countries we call "developing." The evidence from a worldwide survey of developing countries suggests that rebellions have tended to occur where the ruling classes depended mostly on the produce or income from land and therefore were resistant to demands for reform from the rural classes that worked the land. In such agricultural economies, the rulers are not likely to yield political power or give greater economic returns to the workers because to do so would eliminate the basis (landownership) of the rulers' wealth and power.56

Some political scientists have a broader definition of revolution and argue that not all great revolutions occur on the battlefield, nor are they all inspired by public rebellions. Some, like the culture revolution Ataturk brought to Turkey in 1919, for example, are largely the work of charismatic leaders.57 Ataturk's government was responsible for molding a formerly imperial Muslim nation into a democracy and separating church (or mosque) and state. In retrospect, it was a monumental achievement since the role of clerics in government and the definition of democracy have remained ambiguous in much of the Middle East.

Since the winter of 2010, the world has witnessed a remarkable series of popular uprisings known collectively as the Arab Spring that have affected nearly every Muslim nation. It all began in the winter of 2010, when a street vendor in Tunisia set himself on fire after the police confiscated his fruit and vegetable cart. He had been an educated man, as more and more young Tunisians have been in the last few decades, but was unable to find other work in a country that had a 30 percent unemployment rate. His story was met with widespread and persistent protests, and, with the world watching and listening through social media, Tunisia's president fled to Saudi Arabia less than 2 months later, and the Tunisian people were promised a free and democratic election. Within months, similar public protests toppled the leaders of Egypt, Libya, and Yemen. The leaders of nearly every Muslim nation have been affected by the uprising, and many of those who are still in power have promised reforms, reorganized their governments, or promised to leave when their current terms of office end.58 But in many of the countries, turmoil and bloodshed is still on-going. It is too soon to know whether these uprisings will lead to the cultural change many Arab citizens want. But we can glean some characteristics these modern revolutions

all seem to share. Their success depends on foreign support and intervention, in part because the citizens of authoritarian regimes have not been allowed to organize competing political parties. Social media has played a role in the speed with which change has occurred, in part because many leaders are less likely to use force when the world is watching.59 The goal in each nation appears to be a democratically elected government and the end of oppressive regimes.

Finally, a particularly interesting question is why revolutions sometimes, perhaps even usually, fail to measure up to the high hopes of those who initiate them. When rebellions succeed in replacing the ruling elite, the result is often the institution of a military dictatorship even more restrictive and repressive than the government that existed before. The new ruling establishment may merely substitute one set of repressions for another rather than bring any real change to the nation. On the other hand, some revolutions have resulted in fairly drastic overhauls of societies.

The idea of revolution has been one of the central myths and inspirations of many groups both in the past and in the present. The colonial empire building of countries, such as England and France, created a worldwide situation in which rebellion became nearly inevitable. In numerous technologically underdeveloped lands, which have been exploited by more powerful countries for their natural resources and cheap labor, a deep resentment has often developed against the foreign ruling classes or their local clients. Where the ruling classes, native or foreign, refuse to be responsive to those feelings, rebellion becomes the only alternative. In many areas, it has become a way of life.

# Culture Change and Adaptation

We have discussed the fact that culture is patterned, and that adaptation to the environment is one reason why certain culture traits are clustered, because more than one trait is likely to be *adaptive* in a particular environment. We make the assumption that most of the customary behaviors of a culture are probably *adaptive*, or at least not maladaptive, in that environment. Even though customs are learned and not genetically inherited, cultural adaptation may resemble biological adaptation in one major respect. The frequency of certain genetic alternatives is likely to increase over time if those genetic traits increase their carriers' chances of survival and reproduction. Similarly, the frequency of a new learned behavior will increase over time and become customary in a population if the people with that behavior are most likely to survive and reproduce.

One of the most important differences between cultural evolution and genetic evolution is that individuals often can decide whether or not to accept and follow the way their parents behave or think, whereas they cannot decide whether or not to inherit certain genes. When enough individuals change their behavior and beliefs, we say that the culture has changed. Therefore, it is possible for culture change to occur much more rapidly than genetic change.

A dramatic example of intentional cultural change was the adoption and later elimination of the custom of *sepaade* among the Rendille, a pastoral population that herds camels, goats, and sheep in the desert in northern Kenya. According to the *sepaade* tradition, some women had to wait to marry until all their brothers were married. These women could well have been over 40 by the time they married. The Rendille say that this tradition was a result of intense warfare between the Rendille and the Borana

12.8 Relate culture change to the process of adaptation to a changing environment.

during the mid-19th century. Attacked by Borana on horseback, the male warriors had to leave their camels unattended, and the frightened camels fled. The daughters of one male age-set were appointed to look after the camels, and the *sepaade* tradition developed. In 1998, long after warfare with the Borana ceased, the elders decided to free the *sepaade* from their obligation to postpone their own marriages. Interviews with the Rendille in the 1990s revealed that many individuals were fully aware of the reason for the tradition in the first place. Now, they said, there was peace, so there was no longer any reason for the *sepaade* tradition to continue.<sup>49</sup>

The adoption of the *sepaade* is an example of culture change in a changing environment. But what if the environment is stable? Is culture change more or less likely? Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson have shown mathematically that, when the environment is relatively stable and individual mistakes are costly, staying with customary modes of behavior (usually transmitted by parents) is probably more adaptive than changing.50 But what happens when the environment, particularly the social environment, is changing? There are plenty of examples in the modern world of circumstances that force a change: People have to migrate to new places for work; medical care leads to increased population so that land is scarcer; people have had land taken away from them and are forced to make do with less land; and so on.

It is particularly when circumstances change that individuals are likely to try ideas or behaviors that are different from those of their parents. Most people would want to adopt behaviors that are more suited to their present circumstances, but how do they know which behaviors are better? There are various ways to find out. One way is by experimenting, trying out various new behaviors. Another way is to evaluate the experiments of others. If a person who tries a new technique seems successful, we would expect that person to be imitated, just as we would expect people to stick with new behaviors they have personally tried and found successful. Finally, one might choose to do what most people in the new situation decide to do.<sup>51</sup>

Why one choice rather than another? In part, the choice may be a function of the cost or risk of the innovation. It is relatively easy, for example, to find out how long it takes to cut down a tree with an introduced steel ax as compared with a stone ax. Not surprisingly, innovations such as a steel ax catch on relatively quickly because comparison is easy and the results clear-cut. But what if the risk is very great? Suppose the innovation involves adopting a whole new way of farming that you have never practiced before. You can try it, but you might not have any food if you fail. As we discussed earlier, risky innovations are likely to be tried only by those individuals who can afford the risk. Other people may then evaluate their success and adopt the new strategy if it looks promising. Similarly, if you migrate to a new area, say, from a high-rainfall area to a drier one, it may pay to look around to see what most people in the new place do; after all, the people in the drier area probably have customs that are adaptive for that environment.

We can expect, then, that the choices individuals make may often be adaptive ones. But it is important to note that adopting an innovation from someone in one's own society or borrowing an innovation from another society is not always or necessarily beneficial, either in the short or the long run. First, people may make mistakes in judgment, especially when some new behavior seems to satisfy a physical need. Why, for example, have smoking and drug use diffused so widely even though they are likely to reduce a person's chances of survival? Second, even if people are correct in their short-term judgment of benefit, they may be wrong in their judgment about long-run benefit. A new crop may yield more than the old crop for five consecutive years, but the new crop may fail miserably in the sixth year because of lowerthan-normal rainfall or because the new crop depleted soil nutrients. Third, people may be forced by the more powerful to change with few if any benefits for themselves.

Whatever motivates humans to change their behavior, the theory of natural selection suggests that a new behavior is not likely to become cultural or remain cultural over generations if it has harmful reproductive consequences, just as a genetic mutation with harmful consequences is not likely to become frequent in a population.<sup>52</sup> Still, we know of many examples of culture change that seem maladaptive—the switch to bottle-feeding rather than nursing infants, which may spread infection because contaminated water is used, or the adoption of alcoholic beverages, which may lead to alcoholism and early death.

The names shown here were in the top 5 baby names for at least one decade from the 1970s to the 2000s. The number shown is the rank for the decade. If a row is blank it means that the name was not in the top 200. Note that although there is some overlap between adjacent decades in popular names, there is, with the exception of Jennifer, no overlap every other decade. Baby names are widely thought to be a type of culture change that results from random copying, but has no adaptive consequences.

Copying others doing something different is an important part of culture change, but sometimes there is no apparent adaptive consequence. Extrapolating from genetic research that shows that biological change can sometimes occur nonselectively—that is, by pure chance—cultural anthropologists have identified coincidences in popular culture change that they explain as examples of neutral or random copying. Random copying appears to occur with enough frequency that it creates patterns and repetitions that are especially apparent in popular culture. For example, random copying may explain why a large proportion of the public chooses the same favorite song or the same names for their babies (see Figure 12.2).<sup>53</sup>

# Globalization: Problems and Opportunities

Investment capital, people, and ideas are moving around the world at an ever faster rate. $^{60}$ Transportation now allows people and goods to circle the globe in days; telecommunications and the Internet make it possible to send a message around the world in seconds and minutes. Economic exchange is enormously more global and transnational. The word **globalization** is often used nowadays to refer to "the massive flow of goods, people, information, and capital across huge areas of the earth's surface."<sup>61</sup> The process of globalization has resulted in the worldwide spread of cultural features, particularly in the domain of economics and international trade. We buy from the same companies (that have factories all over the world), and we sell our products and services for prices that are set by world market forces. We can eat pizza, hamburgers, curry, or sushi in most urban centers.

12.9 Evaluate the problems and opportunities posed by globalization.

Globalization The ongoing spread of goods, people, information, and capital around the world.

In some ways, cultures are changing in similar directions. They have become more commercial, more urban, and more international. The job has become more important, and kinship less important, as people travel to and work in other countries and return just periodically to their original homes. Ideas about democracy, the rights of the individual, and alternative medical practices and religions have become more widespread; people in many countries of the world watch the same TV shows, wear similar fashions, and listen to the same or similar music. In short, people are increasingly sharing behaviors and beliefs with people in other cultures, and as Paul Durrenberger says, the cultures of the world are less and less things "with edges."62

Globalization as we know it began in earnest about a.d. 1500 with exploration by and expansion of Western societies.63 We tend to think of globalization from a Western perspective. But a form of continental diffusion between Asia, Africa, and Europe had been occurring since at least the beginning of written history, in large part because of the scope and power of empires. The great ancient empires, ruled by Assyrian, Chinese, and Egyptian dynasties, transformed the cultures of the peoples they conquered but were also themselves changed by their encounters. The Roman Empire extended its reach to western Asia in the time of Christ. Arab caliphates ruled parts of medieval Europe and revived long dormant scientific and mathematical traditions. The Mongol Empire swept across Central Asia and into the Baltics in the 13th century. All of these contacts had already transformed parts of the world. Nevertheless, it is safe to say that globalization is occurring today at an unprecedented pace and scale. Very few places in the world have not been affected by globalization.64 Most of the recent external pressures have come from Western societies, but not all. Far Eastern societies, such as Japan and China, have also stimulated culture change.

But diffusion of a culture trait does not mean that it is incorporated in exactly the same way, and the spread of certain products and activities through globalization does not mean that change happens in the same way everywhere. For example, the spread of multinational fast-food restaurants, such as McDonald's or Kentucky Fried Chicken, has come to symbolize globalization. But the behavior of the Japanese in such restaurants is quite different from that of Americans. Perhaps the most surprising difference is that the Japanese who visit a McDonald's actually engage in more familial intimacy and sharing than they do in their traditional restaurants. We imagine that establishments like McDonald's

Worldwide communication and the spread of ideas is facilitated by technology such as satellite TV and the internet. Balconies are used to dry clothes and to hang satellite dishes in this city in Algeria.

promote fast eating. But Japan has long had fast food—noodle shops at train stations, street vendors, and boxed lunches. Sushi, which is usually ordered in the United States at a sit-down restaurant, is often served in Japan at a bar with a conveyor belt—individuals only need to pluck off the wanted dish as it goes by. Observations at McDonald's in Japan suggest that mothers typically order food for the family while the father spends time with the children at a table, a rare event since fathers often work long hours and cannot get home for dinner often. The French fries are typically shared by the family. Even burgers and drinks are passed around, with many people taking a bite or a sip. Japan has historically borrowed food, such as the Chinese noodle soup now called ramen. Indeed, in a survey, ramen was listed as the most representative Japanese food. The burger was the second most-often listed. McDonald's has become Japanese—the younger generation does not even know that McDonald's is a foreign company—they think it is Japanese.65

Enormous amounts of international investment fuel world trade. Shifts in the world marketplace may drastically affect a country's well-being more than ever before. There are many negative effects of colonialism, imperialism, and globalization. For example, 60 percent of Pakistan's industrial employment is in textile and apparel manufacturing, but serious unemployment resulted when that manufacturing was crippled by restrictive American import policies and fears about war between India and Afghanistan.66 Native peoples in many places have lost their land and been forced to work for inadequate wages in mines, plantations, and factories owned by foreign capitalists. Undernutrition, if not starvation, is a common problem. Also, global travel has hastened the spread of such diseases as HIV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (more widely known by its abbreviation SARS), and increasing deforestation has led to a spread of malaria.<sup>67</sup>

Are there any positive consequences of globalization? The "human development indicators" collected by the United Nations suggest many improvements, including increases in life expectancy and literacy in most countries. The increased life expectancy is undoubtedly largely due to the spread of medicines developed in the advanced economies of the West. There is generally less warfare as colonial powers enforced pacification within the colonies that later became independent states. Most important, perhaps, has been the worldwide growth of middle classes whose livelihoods depend on globalizing commerce. The middle classes in many countries have also become agents of social change; empowered by their strength in numbers, they have pressured governments to reduce social injustice and enact democratic reforms.

World trade is the primary engine of economic development. With it, per capita income is increasing. Forty years ago, the countries of Asia were among the poorest countries in the world in terms of per capita income. Since then, because of their involvement in world trade, their incomes have risen enormously. In 1960, South Korea was as poor as India. Now its per capita income is 20 times higher than India's. Singapore is an even more dramatic example. In the late 1960s, its economy was failing. Today, its per capita income is higher than Britain's.68 Mexico used to be a place where North Americans built factories to produce garments for the North American market. Now its labor is no longer so cheap. But because Mexico has easy access to the North American market and because its large labor force is acquiring the necessary skills, it is developing high-tech manufacturing with decent salaries.69

Not every country has a large labor force, a fact that has promoted a world trade in people. Many countries now export labor to other countries, with their government's blessing. Mexico has done so for a long time. Millions of people from Bangladesh are overseas on government-sponsored work contracts. Virtually every family in a Bangladeshi village depends on someone who works overseas and sends money home. Without those remittances, many would face starvation.70

Does the higher per capita income that can come with globalization mean that life has improved generally in a country? Not necessarily. Inequality within countries can increase with technological improvements, since the rich often benefit the most. In addition, economic wealth is increasingly concentrated in a relatively small number of countries. Although most countries may be doing better on average, there is also more income and class inequality, and poverty is more widespread.

Although many of the changes associated with globalization seem to be driven by the economic and political power of the richer countries, the movement of ideas, art, music, and food is more reciprocal, in large part because people who migrate bring their culture with them. Thanks to migration, North Americans regularly eat tortilla chips and salsa, sushi, and curries; listen to reggae music; dance to Latin American rhythms; live with African carvings; and wear beaded necklaces.

In counterreaction to globalization, there has also been increased interest recently in gaining knowledge about the indigenous plants, healing traditions, and shamanistic practices within countries. As indigenous knowledge comes to be viewed as potentially valuable, shamans have been able to speak out on national and international issues. In Brazil, for example, shamans have organized to speak out against "biopiracy"—the perceived unethical appropriation of biological knowledge for commercial purposes. In a more globalized world, such indigenous activists can be heard by more people than ever before: In spite of the fact that indigenous people constitute less than 1 percent of the Brazilian population, some activist groups have been able to keep in touch with international environmentalists, using tape recorders and video cameras to convey information about their local situation.71

It is probably not possible to go back to a time when societies were not so dependent on each other, not so interconnected through world trade, and not so dependent on commercial exchange. Even those who are most upset with globalization find it difficult to imagine that it is possible to return to a less connected world. For better or worse, the world is interconnected and will remain so. The question now is whether the average economic improvements in countries will eventually translate into economic improvements for most individuals.

# Ethnogenesis: The Emergence of New Cultures

Many of the processes that we have discussed—expansion and domination by the West and other powerful nations, peoples' reduced ability to earn their livelihoods by traditional means, the imposition of schools or other methods to force acculturation, attempts

to convert people to other religions, and globalization—have led to profound changes in culture. But if culture change in the modern world has made cultures more alike in some ways, it has not eliminated cultural differences. Indeed, many cultures still vary considerably. Moreover, the aftermath of violent events, such as depopulation, relocation, enslavement, and genocide, can lead to **ethnogenesis**, a process whereby a group creates a new culture.<sup>72</sup>

Some of the most dramatic examples of ethnogenesis occur in areas where escaped slaves (called Maroons) have settled. Maroon societies emerged in the past few hundred years in a variety of New World locations, from the United States to the West Indies and northern parts of South America. One such new culture in South America, now known as Aluku, emerged when slaves fled from coastal plantations in Suriname to the swampy interior country along the Cottica River. After a war with the Dutch colonists, this particular group moved to French Guiana. The escaped slaves, originating from widely varying cultures in Africa or born on Suriname plantations, organized themselves into autonomous communities with military headmen.<sup>73</sup> Although Aluku settlements shifted location as a way of evading enemies, co-residence in a community and collective ownership of land became important parts of their emerging identities. Communities took on the names of the specific plantations from which their leaders had escaped. Principles of inheritance through the female line began to develop, and full-fledged

**Ethnogenesis** Creation of a new culture.

12.10 Describe and give examples of ethnogenesis, or the emergence of new cultures.

# **Migrants and Immigrants**

#### Increasing Cultural Diversity Within the Countries of the World

he modern world is culturally diverse in two ways. There are native cultures in every part of the world, and today most countries have people from different cultures who have arrived relatively recently. Recent arrivals may be migrants coming for temporary work, or they may be refugees, forced by persecution or genocide to migrate, or they may be immigrants who voluntarily come into a new country. Parts of populations have moved away from their native places since the dawn of humanity. The first modern-looking humans moved out of Africa only in the last 100,000 years, and people have been moving ever since. The people we call Native Americans were actually the first to come to the New World; most anthropologists think they came from northeast Asia.

In the last 200 years, the United States and Canada have experienced extensive influxes of people. Native Americans are vastly outnumbered by descendants of earlier immigrants and by newcomers from Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America, and elsewhere. North America not only has native and regional subcultures but also ethnic, religious, and occupational subcultures, each with its own distinctive set of culture traits. Thus, North American culture is partly a "melting pot" and partly a mosaic of cultural diversity. Many of us (aside from anthropologists) like the variety such diversity brings to our lives.

Many of the population movements in the world today, as in the past, are responses to persecution and war. The word *diaspora* is often used nowadays to refer to these major dispersions. Most were and are involuntary; people are fleeing danger and

death. But this is not always the case. Scholars distinguish between different types of diasporas, including "victim," "labor," "trade," and "imperial." The Africans who were sold into slavery; the Armenians who fled genocide in the early 20th century; the Jews who fled persecution and genocide in various places over the centuries; the Palestinians who fled to the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, and Lebanon in the mid-20th century; and the Rwandans who fled genocide toward the end of the 20th century may have mostly been victims. But the Chinese, Italians, and Poles may have mostly moved to take advantage of job opportunities, the Lebanese to trade, and the British to extend and service their empire.

Often categories of diaspora overlap; population movements can and have occurred for more than one reason. As economics and politics are more

globalized, diasporas are becoming more "transnational"; and the ease of global communications allows people to maintain social, economical, and political ties to their homelands. Some diasporic communities play an active role in the politics of their homelands, and some nation-states have begun to recognize their far-flung emigrants as important constituencies.

Cultural anthropologists are increasingly studying migrant, refugee, and immigrant groups and focusing on how the groups have adapted their cultures to new surroundings, what they have retained, how they relate to the homeland, how they have developed an ethnic consciousness, and how they relate to other minority groups and the majority culture.

Sources: M. Ember et al. 2005; Levinson and M Fmber 1997

matriclans became the core of each village. They practiced slash-and-burn cultivation, with women doing most of the work. Aluku also established spiritual practices. Each village had its own shrine, the *faaka tiki*, where residents invoked the clan ancestors, as well as a special house where the deceased were brought and honored before being taken to the forest for burial. And Aluku clans inherited avenging spirits with whom they could communicate through mediums.

The Aluku are a clear example of ethnogenesis because the culture did not exist 350 years ago. It emerged and was created by people trying to adapt to circumstances not of their own making. In common with other cases of emerging ethnic identity, the Aluku came not only to share new patterns of behavior but also to see themselves as having a common origin (a common ancestor), a shared history, and a common religion.74

The emergence of the Seminole in Florida is another example of ethnogenesis. The early settlers who moved to what is now Florida and later became known as Seminole largely derived from the Lower Creek Kawita chiefdom. The Kawita chiefdom, like other southeastern Muskogean chiefdoms, was a large, complex, and multiethnic paramount chiefdom. Its ruler, Kawita, relied on allegiance and tribute from outlying districts on which he imposed ritual and linguistic hegemony.75

A combination of internal divisions among the Lower Creek, vacant land in northern Florida, and weak Spanish control over northern Florida apparently prompted dissidents to move away and settle in three different areas in Florida. Three new chiefdoms were established, essentially similar to those the settlers left and still under the supposed control of Kawita.76 But the three chiefdoms began to act together under the leadership of Tonapi, the Talahassi chief. After 1780, over a period of 40 or so years, the three Seminole chiefdoms formally broke with Kawita. Not only was geographic separation a factor, but the political and economic interests of the Creek Confederacy and of the Seminole had diverged. For example, the Creek supported neutrality in the American Revolution, but the Seminole took the side of the British. During this time, the British encouraged slaves to escape by promising freedom in Florida. These Maroon communities allied themselves with the emerging Seminole. The composition of the Seminole population again changed dramatically after the War of 1812 and the Creek War of 1814.77 First, a large number of Creek refugees, mostly Upper Creek Talapusa (who spoke a different Muskogean language), became Seminole. Second, the Seminole ranks were also expanded by a large number of escaped slaves and Maroons who fled when the Americans destroyed a British fort in 1816. Larger scale political events continued to influence Seminole history. When the Americans conquered Florida, they insisted on dealing with one unified Seminole council, they removed the Seminole to a reserve in Florida, and later, after the second Seminole war, removed most of them to Oklahoma.78 It would seem from this and other cases that cultural identities can be shaped and reshaped by political and economic processes.

12.11 Characterize what anthropologists predict about future cultural diversity.

# Cultural Diversity in the Future

Measured in terms of travel time, the world today is much smaller than it has ever been. It is possible now to fly halfway around the globe in the time it took people less than a century ago to travel to the next state. In the realm of communication, the world is even smaller. We can talk to someone on the other side of the globe in a matter of minutes, we can send that person a message (by cell phone or the Internet) in seconds, and through television we can see live coverage of events in that person's country. More and more people are drawn into the world market economy, buying and selling similar things and, as a consequence, altering the patterns of their lives in sometimes similar ways. Still, although modern transportation and communication facilitate the rapid spread of some cultural characteristics to all parts of the globe, it is highly unlikely that all parts of the world will end up the same culturally. Cultures are bound to retain some of their original characteristics or develop distinctive new adaptations. Even though television has diffused around the world, local people continue to prefer local programs when they are available. And even when people all over the world watch the same program, they may interpret it in very different ways. People are not just absorbing the messages they get, they often resist or revise them.79

Until recently, researchers studying culture change generally assumed that the differences between people of different cultures would become minimal. But in the last 30 years or so, it has become increasingly apparent that, although many differences disappear, many people are affirming ethnic identities in a process that often involves deliberately introducing cultural difference.80 Eugeen Roosens describes the situation of the Huron of Quebec, who in the late 1960s seemed to have disappeared as a distinct culture. The Huron language had disappeared and the lives of the Huron were not obviously distinguishable from those of the French Canadians around them. The Huron then developed a new identity as they actively worked to promote the rights of indigenous peoples like themselves. That their new defining cultural symbols bore no resemblance to the past Huron culture is beside the point.

One fascinating possibility is that ethnic diversity and ethnogenesis may be a result of broader processes. Elizabeth Cashdan found that the degree of ethnic diversity appears to be related to environmental unpredictability, which is associated with greater distance from the equator.81 More predictability seems to be associated with greater ethnic diversity. There are many more cultural groups nearer to the equator than in very northern and southern latitudes. Perhaps, Cashdan suggests, environmental unpredictability in the north and south necessitates wider ties between social groups to allow cooperation in case local resources fail. This may minimize the likelihood of cultural divergence, that is, ethnogenesis. Hence, there will be fewer cultures further from the equator.

Future research on culture change should increase our understanding of how and why various types of change are occurring. If we can increase our understanding of culture change in the present, we should be better able to understand similar processes in the past. We may be guided in our efforts to understand culture change by the large number of crosscultural correlations that have been discovered between a particular cultural variation and its presumed causes.82 All cultures have changed over time; variation is the product of differential change. Thus, the variations we see are the products of change processes, and the discovered predictors of those variations may suggest how and why the changes occurred.

# Summary and Review

### Defining Culture

12.1 Discuss the concept of culture as used in anthropology, its salient properties, and controversies surrounding the concept of culture.

- • Culture is the set of learned behaviors and ideas (including beliefs, attitudes, values, and ideals) that are characteristic of a particular society or other social group.
- • Behaviors can also produce products or material culture, including houses, musical instruments, and tools that are the products of customary behavior.
- • Anthropologists have traditionally been concerned with the cultural characteristics of societies. Societies may or may not correspond to countries; many countries, particularly newer ones, contain many societies.
- • The terms *society* and *culture* are not synonymous. Society refers to a group of people; culture refers to the learned and shared behaviors, ideas, and characteristic of those people.
- • Even when anthropologists refer to something as cultural, there is always individual variation, and not everyone in a society shares a particular cultural characteristic of that society.

- • For something to be considered cultural, it must be not only shared but also learned.
- • Cognitive anthropologists are most likely to say that culture refers not to behaviors but to the rules and ideas behind them, and that culture therefore resides in people's heads.
- • Another view is that culture is an entity, a force, that profoundly affects the individuals who live within its influence.

![](_page_31_Picture_15.jpeg)

### Cultural Constraints

12.2 Describe direct and indirect cultural constraints, and how they relate to norms.

- • Because members of a culture generally conform to that culture, they are not always aware of being constrained by its standards and rules for acceptable behavior, which social scientists refer to as norms.
- • Cultural constraints can be direct or indirect.

![](_page_32_Picture_1.jpeg)

What is an example of a direct cultural constraint and an indirect cultural constraint?

# Attitudes That Hinder the Study of Cultures

12.3 Identify attitudes that hinder the study of cultures.

- • Ethnocentrism—a view of one's cultural behaviors and attitudes as correct and those of other cultures as immoral or inferior—can bias objectively observing another culture.
- • Ethnocentrism also keeps a person from understanding his or her own customs.
- • Glorification of one's own culture or that of another also hinders effective anthropological study.

![](_page_32_Picture_8.jpeg)

What are some examples of ethnocentrism?

# Cultural Relativism

12.4 Critically assess the concept of cultural relativism.

- • The idea of cultural relativism rejects the notion that Western cultures are at the highest or most progressive stage of evolution.
- • Cultural relativism attempts to objectively describe and understand a society's customs and ideas in the context of that society's problems and opportunities.
- • Following the idea of cultural relativism helps anthropologists be alert to perspectives in other cultures that might challenge their own cultural beliefs about what is true and that might lead them to make moral judgments.
- • Approaches using cultural relativism pose conflicts with efforts to create universal standards of human rights. However, universal human rights advocates might increase their persuasiveness if they are aware of the viewpoints and values within a particular culture.

![](_page_32_Picture_16.jpeg)

What are some of the controversies surrounding the concept of cultural relativism?

# Describing a Culture

12.5 Describe the methods by which anthropologists describe cultures.

- • Understanding what is cultural involves (a) separating what is shared from what is individually variable and (b) understanding whether common behaviors and ideas are learned.
- • Variations in behavior are typically confined within socially acceptable limits.
- • Anthropologists try to distinguish actual behavior from ideal cultural traits—the ideas about how people in particular situations ought to feel and behave. Ideal cultural traits may differ from actual behavior because the ideal is based on the way society used to be.
- • When a domain of behavior includes many individual variations or when the people studied are unaware of their pattern of behavior, the anthropologist may need to collect information from a larger sample of individuals to establish what the cultural trait is.
- • Anthropologists suspect that something is largely learned if it varies from society to society and is genetically influenced when it is found in all societies.

![](_page_32_Picture_25.jpeg)

How do anthropologists distinguish between what is cultural or individually variable?

# Culture Is Patterned

12.6 Explain why culture is integrated or patterned.

- • A culture that is mostly integrated is one in which elements or traits are mostly adjusted to or consistent with one another.
- • Integration may be influenced by psychological processes and by people transferring experiences from one area of life to another.
- • Cultural traits may become patterned through adaptation. Customs that diminish the survival chances of a society are not likely to persist. However, what may be adaptive in one environment may not be adaptive in another.

![](_page_32_Picture_32.jpeg)

What are some examples of cultural patterning or integration?

### How and Why Cultures Change

12.7 Describe and give examples of how cultures change through discovery and invention, diffusion, and acculturation.

- • Examining the history of a society will reveal that its culture has changed over time. Consequently, in describing a culture, it is important to understand that a description pertains to a particular time period.
- • A good deal of culture change may be stimulated by changes in the external environment.
- • Inventions and discoveries (including behavior and ideas), when accepted and regularly used by a society, will change the culture. These inventions and discoveries might be unintentional or intentional.
- • Relatively little is known about why some people are more innovative than others. The ability to innovate may depend in part on such individual characteristics as high intelligence and creativity. Creativity may be influenced by social conditions.
- • In general, people are more likely to adopt a behavior or innovation as it becomes more common. The speed with which an innovation is adopted may depend partly on how new behaviors and ideas are typically transmitted—or taught—in a society.
- • New cultural elements in one society may come from another society. Innovation occurring in this way is called diffusion. The three basic patterns of diffusion are direct contact, intermediate contact, and stimulus diffusion.
- • Diffusion is a selective process. New traits and elements will be rejected or accepted depending on complex variables.
- • Acculturation is another type of change that occurs when different cultural groups come into intensive contact. Acculturation occurs primarily when one of the two societies in contact is more powerful than the other.
- • One of the most drastic and rapid way a culture can change is as a result of revolution—replacement, usually violent, of a country's rulers.
- • The sources of revolution may be mostly internal, or partly external. Revolutions are not always successful in their goals, nor necessarily in bringing about culture change.
- • Not all people who are suppressed, conquered, or colonialized eventually rebel against established authority. Revolutions are more likely in countries that are just becoming industrialized.

![](_page_33_Picture_14.jpeg)

How do cultures change through discovery and invention, diffusion, and acculturation?

# Culture Change and Adaptation

12.8 Relate culture change to the process of adaptation to a changing environment.

- • The frequency of a new learned behavior will increase over time and become customary in a population if the people exhibiting that behavior are most likely to survive and reproduce. It is possible for culture change to occur much more rapidly than genetic change.
- • When circumstances change, individuals are particularly likely to try ideas or behaviors that are different from those of their parents.

![](_page_33_Picture_20.jpeg)

What is an example of how adaptation can lead to culture change?

### Globalization: Problems and Opportunities

12.9 Evaluate the problems and opportunities posed by globalization.

- • The process of globalization has resulted in the worldwide spread of cultural features, particularly in the domain of economics and international trade.
- • In some ways, cultures are changing in similar directions. They have become more commercial, more urban, and more international.
- • A form of continental diffusion between Asia, Africa, and Europe had been occurring since at least the beginning of written history, in large part because of the scope and power of empires.
- • Worldwide diffusion of a culture trait does not mean that it is incorporated in exactly the same way among societies, and the spread of certain products and activities through globalization does not mean that change happens in the same way everywhere.
- • Negative effects of globalization include unemployment, native peoples' loss of land, increasing class inequality, undernutrition and starvation, and spread of disease.
- • Positive effects of globalization include increases in life expectancy and literacy, less warfare, and growth of middle classes, which have become agents of social change.

• Movement of ideas, art, music, and food among cultures tends to be reciprocal.

![](_page_34_Picture_2.jpeg)

Using some examples, what are some examples of positive and negative effects of globailization?

### Ethnogenesis: The Emergence of New Cultures

12.10 Describe and give examples of ethnogenesis, or the emergence of new cultures.

- • Despite the trend of globalization, many cultures still vary considerably, and new cultures have been created—a process called ethnogenesis.
- • In particular, cases of violent events such as depopulation, relocation, enslavement, and genocide can lead to ethnogenesis.

![](_page_34_Picture_8.jpeg)

What is ethnogenesis? Under what conditions is it more likely?

# Cultural Diversity in the Future

12.11 Characterize what anthropologists predict about future cultural diversity.

- • Although modern transportation and communication facilitate the rapid spread of some cultural characteristics to all parts of the globe, it is highly unlikely that all parts of the world will end up the same culturally.
- • Many people are affirming ethnic identities in a process that often involves deliberately introducing cultural difference.
- • One study suggests that there are many more cultural groups nearer to the equator than in very northern and southern latitudes, possibly associated with levels of greater environmental predictability.

![](_page_34_Picture_15.jpeg)

Why will globalization processes likely not result in the development of a homogenous worldwide culture?

# Think on it

- 1. Would it be adaptive for a society to have everyone adhere to the cultural norms? Explain your answer.
- 2. Not all people faced with external pressure to change do so or do so at the same rate. What factors might explain why some societies rapidly change their culture?
- 3. Does the concept of cultural relativism promote international understanding, or does it hinder attempts to have international agreement on acceptable behavior, such as human rights?
