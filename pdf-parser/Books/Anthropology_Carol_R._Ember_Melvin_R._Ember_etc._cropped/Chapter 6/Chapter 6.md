**D**ipedal locomotion is a defining feature of the hominins. Undisputed bipedal hominins<br>lived in East Africa about 4 million years ago (see Figure 6.1). These hominins, and some others who may have lived later in eastern and southern Africa, are generally classified in the genus *Australopithecus*. In this chapter, we discuss what we know or suspect about the transition from hominoids to hominins, the emergence of australopithecines, and their relationship to later hominins, including ourselves.

6.1 Evaluate theories for the evolution of bipedal locomotion.

# The Evolution of Bipedal Locomotion

Perhaps the most crucial change in early hominin evolution was the development of *bipedal* locomotion, or walking on two legs. We know from the fossil record that other important physical changes—including the expansion of the brain, modification of the female pelvis

![](_page_1_Figure_5.jpeg)

to allow bigger-brained babies to be born, and reduction of the face, teeth, and jaws—did not occur until about 2 million years after the emergence of bipedalism. Other human characteristics, such as an extended period of infant and child dependency and increased meat-eating, may also have developed after that time.

We do not know whether bipedalism developed quickly or gradually because the fossil record for the period between 8 million and 4 million years ago is very slim. We do know, on the basis of their skeletal anatomy, that many of the Miocene anthropoids were capable of assuming an upright posture. For example, brachiation, swinging by the arms through the trees, puts an animal in an upright position; so does climbing up and down trees with the use of grasping hands and feet.<sup>1</sup> It is also likely that the protohominins were capable of occasional bipedalism, just as many modern monkeys and  $\text{apes are.}^2$ 

Definitely bipedal hominins emerged in Africa, judging by the available fossil record. The emergence of bipedal hominins coincides with a change from extensive tropical forest cover to more discontinuous patches of forest and open country.<sup>3</sup> About 16 million to 11 million years ago, a drying trend set in that continued into the Pliocene. Gradually, the African rain forests, deprived of intense humidity and rainfall, dwindled in extent; areas of *savanna* (grasslands) and scattered deciduous woodlands became more common. The tree-dwelling primates did not completely lose their customary habitats because some tropical forests remained in wetter regions, and natural selection continued to favor the better-adapted tree dwellers in those forested areas. But the new, more open country probably favored characteristics adapted to ground living in some primates as well as other animals. In the evolutionary line leading to humans, these adaptations included bipedalism (see the box on "Environmental Changes and Evolutionary Consequences in Hominins").

### **Environmental Change and Evolutionary Consequences in Hominins**

onathan Wells and Jay Stock argue that environmental change led humans to become "colonizing apes," able to live in diverse environments because of developmental plasticity and learned behaviors. It makes sense that early hominins would have changed, both physically and behaviorally, to adapt to the changing environment at the end of the Pliocene. Indeed bipedalism seems obviously linked to the emergence of mixed woodlandsavanna environments in eastern Africa. But what other adaptations accompanied the changing environment? Paleoanthropologists have proposed many hypotheses.

Elizabeth Vrba suggested that the long cooling period at the end of the Pliocene would have resulted in hominin bodies becoming larger and limbs relatively shorter following Bergmann's and Allen's rules. But what was the mechanism for bringing about this change? Vrba suggests

that hominin maturation slowed and therefore hominins retained more juvenile body forms and limb proportions (juveniles have bigger bodies proportional to their legs and arms). Since the hominin brain grows most rapidly during maturation, the longer period of childhood or maturation allowed hominin brains to grow proportionally larger.

Barry Bogin suggested that there were additional adaptive consequences of a long period of childhood. Brain growth requires a lot of calories that mothers cannot provide solely from breast milk; those mothers who worked with others to provision their children with high-calorie foods might produce children with more brain power. In addition, if mothers provide highcalorie foods and stop nursing somewhat earlier, they can have more offspring. Bogin also suggests that a long childhood has other

advantages. Particularly important is a great degree of developmental plasticity, that is, the ability to acclimatize to an environment or to learn new behaviors necessary to survival in a changing environment.

As Vrba and Bogin have suggested, developmental plasticity and a brain capable of social learning may have emerged among hominins ultimately because of late Pliocene cooling. The greater reproductive rate in early hominins would have led to population increases that Wells and Stock suggest may have forced hominins to expand their ranges, ultimately leading them to colonize new areas.

Thus, these scholars consider much of what constitutes the core of hominin behavior to have resulted directly from environmental change.

### Theories for the Evolution of Bipedalism

What in particular may have favored the emergence of bipedal hominins? There are several possible explanations for this development. One idea is that bipedalism was adaptive for life amid the tall grasses of the savannas because an erect posture may have made it easier to spot ground predators as well as potential prey.4 This theory does not adequately account for the development of bipedalism, however. Baboons and some other Old World monkeys also live in savanna environments, yet although they can stand erect and occasionally do so, they have not evolved fully bipedal locomotion. And recent evidence suggests that the area where early hominins lived in East Africa was not predominantly savanna; rather, it seems to have been a mix of woodland and open country.5

Other theories stress the importance of freeing the hands. If some hand activity is critical while an animal is moving, selection may favor bipedalism because it frees the hands to perform other activities at the same time. What hand activities might have been so critical?

Gordon Hewes suggested that carrying food in the hands was the critical activity; if it were necessary to carry food from one locale to another, moving about only on the hind limbs would have been adaptive.6 Hewes emphasized the importance of carrying hunted or scavenged meat, but many paleoanthropologists now question whether early hominins hunted or even scavenged.<sup>7</sup> However, the ability to carry any food to a place safe from predators may have been one of the more important advantages of bipedalism. C. Owen Lovejoy has suggested that food carrying might have been important for another reason. If males provisioned females and their babies by carrying food back to a home base, the females would have been able to conserve energy by not traveling and therefore might have been able to produce and care for more babies.8 Thus, whatever the advantages of carrying food, the more bipedal a protohominin was, the more it might reproduce.

But carrying food or provisioning families might not have been the only benefit of freeing the hands; feeding itself may have been more efficient. Clifford Jolly has argued that bipedalism would have allowed early hominins to efficiently harvest small seeds and nuts because both hands could be used to pick up food and move it directly to the mouth.9 Natural selection would not have favored bipedalism just for locomotion but also for more efficient foraging. In the changing environments of East Africa, where forests were giving way to more open woodlands and savannas, an advantage in foraging for small seeds and nuts might well have proven important for survival and thus have been favored by natural selection.

Bipedalism might also have been favored by natural selection because the freeing of the hands would allow protohominins to use, and perhaps even make, tools that they could carry with them as they moved about. Consider how advantageous such tool use might have been. Sherwood Washburn noted that some contemporary ground-living primates dig for roots to eat, "and if they could use a stone or a stick they might easily double their food supply."10 David Pilbeam also suggests why tool use by the more open-country primates may have appreciably increased the number and amount of plant foods they could eat: In order to be eaten, many of the plant foods in the grassy areas probably had to be chopped, crushed, or otherwise prepared with the aid of tools.11 Tools may also have been used to kill and butcher animals for food. Without tools, primates in general are not well equipped physically for regular hunting or even scavenging. Their teeth and jaws are not sharp and strong enough, and their speed afoot is not fast enough. So the use of tools to kill and butcher game might have enlarged even further their ability to exploit the available food supply.

Finally, tools may have been used as weapons against predators, which would have been a great threat to the relatively defenseless ground-dwelling protohominins. In Milford Wolpoff's opinion, it was the advantage of carrying weapons *continuously* that was responsible for transforming occasional bipedalism to completely bipedal locomotion.12 In particular, Sue Savage-Rumbaugh has suggested that the ability to abduct or snap the wrist would have permitted early humans "to perfect both throwing and rock-striking skills [for toolmaking] and consequently to develop throwing as a much more effective predator defense system than apes could ever manage."13

But some anthropologists question the idea that tool use and toolmaking favored bipedalism. They point out that the first clear evidence of stone tools appears more than 2 million years *after* the emergence of bipedalism. So how could toolmaking be responsible for bipedalism? Wolpoff suggests an answer. Even though bipedalism appears to be at least 2 million years older than stone tools, it is not unlikely that protohominins used tools made of wood and bone, neither of which would be as likely as stone to survive in the archaeological record. Moreover, unmodified stone tools present in the archaeological record might not be recognizable as tools.14

Some researchers have taken a closer look at the mechanics of bipedal locomotion to see if it might be a more efficient form of locomotion in the savanna-woodland environment, where resources are likely to be scattered. Compared with the quadrupedal locomotion of primates such as chimpanzees, bipedalism appears to be more efficient for long-distance travel (see Figure 6.2).15 But why travel long distances? If the ancestors of

![](_page_4_Figure_3.jpeg)

#### Figure 6.2 Skeletal Evidence of Bipedalism

Because humans move about on their legs only, the human skeleton differs from the skeleton of the great ape. The human head is more or less balanced on the backbone (see the feature marked 3 in the figure). There is no need for powerful muscles at the back of the neck, as in the great ape. The human vertebral column (see 4 in the figure) has a forward curvature in the neck and lower back regions. These two extra curves, along with the curvature in the middle back region, allow the backbone to act more like a spring, which is advantageous given that the legs have to bear all the weight and given the need to balance on one leg with each stride. Bipedal locomotion has favored a human pelvis (see 1 in the figure) that is lower and broader than the ape pelvis. In contrast to the apes, the legs in humans are longer than the arms and represent a larger proportion of the body weight (see 2 in the figure); this change lowers the body's center of gravity and is advantageous with bipedalism. The most obvious adaptation to bipedalism is the human foot (see 5 in the figure). The big toe is not opposed to the other toes, as in the other primates, and the foot can no longer grasp. When we walk, the big toe is the last point of contact with the ground before the leg swings forward, which explains why the big toe has become aligned with the other toes.

humans had the manipulative ability and tool-using capability of modern chimpanzees (e.g., using stones to crack nuts), and those ancestors had to move around in a more open environment, then those individuals who could efficiently travel longer distances to exploit those resources might do better.16

Finally, bipedalism might have been favored by natural selection as a way of regulating body temperature, particularly in the increasingly hot and dry environments of East Africa at the end of the Miocene and the beginning of the Pliocene. Peter Wheeler has argued that a bipedal posture limits the area of the body directly exposed to the sun, especially when the sun is at its hottest, at midday.17 Bipedal posture would also facilitate convective heat loss by allowing heat to rise up and away from the body rather than being trapped underneath it. (We radiate a lot of body heat through the head.) Cooling through the evaporation of sweat would also be facilitated by a bipedal posture, as more skin area would be exposed to cooling winds. Thus, natural selection may have favored bipedalism because it reduced heat stress in the warming environments of East Africa.

All theories about the origin of bipedalism are speculative. We do not yet have direct evidence that any of the factors we have discussed were actually responsible for bipedalism. Any or all of the factors may explain the transformation of an occasionally bipedal protohominin to a completely bipedal hominin.

### The "Costs" of Bipedalism

We must remember that there are also "costs" to bipedal walking. Bipedalism makes it harder to overcome gravity to supply the brain with sufficient blood,18 and the weight of the body above the pelvis and lower limbs puts greater stress on the hips, lower back, knees, and feet. As Adrienne Zihlman points out, the stresses on the lower body are even greater for females.19 Females have to support extra weight during pregnancy, and as mothers they usually are responsible for carrying nursing infants. So whatever the advantages of bipedalism, they must be greater than the disadvantages—or our ancestors never would have become bipedal.

We must also remember that the evolution of bipedalism required some dramatic changes in the ancestral ape skeleton. Although apes today can and do walk bipedally, they cannot do so efficiently or for long periods of time. To be habitually bipedal, the ancestral ape skeleton had to be modified, and the major changes that allowed the early hominins to become fully bipedal occurred primarily in the skull, pelvis, knees, and feet.20 Let's take a look at each of these changes (see Figure 6.2).

In both ancient and modern apes, the spinal column enters the skull toward the back, which makes sense because apes generally walk on all fours, with the spine roughly parallel to the ground. In bipedal hominins, the spinal column enters the skull at the bottom, through a hole called the *foramen magnum*. Thus, when hominins became bipedal, the skull ended up on top of the spinal column.

The shape of ancient and modern ape pelvises is considerably different from that of a bipedal hominin. Ape pelvises are long and flat, forming a bony plate in the lower back to which the leg muscles attach. In bipedal hominins, the pelvis is bowl-shaped, which supports the internal organs and also lowers the body's center of gravity, allowing better balance on the legs. The hominin pelvis also provides a different set of muscle attachments and shifts the orientation of the femurs (the upper leg bones) from the side of the pelvis to the front. These changes allow hominins to move their legs forward in a bipedal stride (and do things like kick a soccer ball). Apes, in comparison, move their legs forward (when they walk bipedally) by shifting their pelvis from side to side, not by kicking each leg forward alternately as we do.<sup>21</sup>

Another change associated with the hominin ability to kick the leg forward is our "knockkneed" posture. Ape legs hang straight down from the pelvis. Bipedal hominin legs, on the other hand, angle inward toward one another. This configuration not only helps us move our legs forward but also helps us maintain a center of gravity in the midline of our bodies so that our center of gravity does not shift from side to side when we walk or run.

Finally, the feet of bipedal hominins have two major changes compared to those of apes. First, hominin feet have an enlarged group of ankle bones forming a robust heel that can withstand the substantial forces placed on them as a result of habitual bipedalism.

#### **Foramen magnum**

Opening in the base of the skull through which the spinal cord passes en route to the brain.

Second, hominin feet have an arch, which also aids in absorbing the forces endured by the feet during bipedal locomotion. We know this arch is vital to our ability to be habitually bipedal because "flat-footed" people who lack it have chronic problems in their feet, ankles, knees, and back.22

When did these changes take place? We don't know for sure, but fossils from East Africa—Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Kenya—clearly show that bipedal hominins lived there between 4 million and 5 million years ago, perhaps even earlier.

# The Transition from Hominoids to Hominins

Until the 1990s, there was no good candidate for a transitional species from hominoids to hominins. The first plausible candidate was discovered in 1992 and was named *Ardipithecus*, but it was not the earliest transitional candidate—it dates to 4.4 to 5.8 million years ago. *Orrorin tugenensis* was discovered in 1998 and became the earliest candidate (5.8 to 6 million years ago) for a while. However in 2001, finds dating back 7 million years were found in western Chad.

Western Chad, in north-central Africa, and its windswept deserts do not seem a likely place to find fossil apes or hominins, but paleoanthropologist Michel Brunet thinks it might be.23 Western Chad was covered by an ancient lake and for several million years was a location where forest-dwelling mammals, including primates, congregated. Around 7 million years ago, a primate called *Sahelanthropus tchadensis* lived on the shores of the lake, where Brunet and his colleagues recovered its fossilized bones in 2001. *Sahelanthropus*, represented by an almost complete skull, has a unique mix of hominin and hominoid traits. Although the skull itself is hominoid, with a small brain, large brow ridges, and wide face, the teeth seem more homininlike, especially the canines, which do not project below the tooth row.24 Unfortunately, there is no evidence that *Sahelanthropus* was bipedal. For now, we have to wait for additional evidence to know whether *Sahelanthropus* was the first bipedal ape.

There is, however, tantalizing evidence that another possible early hominin, *Orrorin tugenensis*, was bipedal. Discovered in western Kenya by Brigitte Senut and colleagues in 1998, *Orrorin tugenensis* consists of 19 specimens of jaw, teeth, finger, arm, and leg bones, including the top of a femur.25 The femur in *Orrorin*, according to Brian

Richmond and William Jungers, shows adaptations to bipedalism, including a long, angled "head" (or top).26 *Orrorin* dates between 5.8 and 6 million years, so it may turn out to be the earliest hominin if further research supports *Orrorin* bipedalism.

In 1992, a team of researchers led by anthropologist Tim White began surveying a 4.4-million-year-old fossil deposit at Aramis, in the Middle Awash region of Ethiopia. There, they discovered 17 fossils of what may be the earliest hominin (more have been found since, including some fragments dating perhaps as early as 5.8 million years ago). Although initially suggested to be a new australopithecine species, White and his colleagues decided that *ramidus*, the species name given to the new fossils, was distinct enough from the australopithecines to warrant a new genus: *Ardipithecus.*<sup>27</sup>

What makes *Ardipithecus ramidus* unique is the combination of apelike dentition along with evidence of bipedal locomotion and an overall homininlike skeleton. Like apes, *Ardipithecus* has relatively small cheek teeth with thin enamel and relatively large canines. However, its arm bones seem homininlike, and the base of its skull shows the foramen magnum positioned underneath the skull, just as in definitely bipedal hominins.28 The feet of *Ardipithecus* also seem adapted to bipedalism.29 Although more evidence is needed to be sure, *Ardipithecus* may be the earliest hominin yet found.

*anamensis* A species of *Australopithecus* that lived perhaps 4.2 million years ago.

*Australopithecus afarensis* A species of *Australopithecus* that lived 4 million to 3 million years ago in East Africa and was definitely bipedal.

# The First Definite Hominins

Although some doubt remains about the status of *Ardipithecus* as a hominin genus, there is no doubt that the australopithecines (members of the genus *Australopithecus*) and paranthropoids (members of the genus *Paranthropus*) were hominins. (Figure 6.3 shows australopithecine and paranthropoid sites.) Their teeth share the basic hominin characteristics of small canines, flat and thickly enameled molars, and a parabolic dental arch, and there is unambiguous evidence that even the earliest australopithecines were fully bipedal. Not only do their skeletons reflect bipedal locomotion, but at Laetoli, Tanzania, more than 50 hardened humanlike footprints about 3.6 million years old give striking confirmation that the hominins there were fully bipedal. The bipedalism of the australopithecines and paranthropoids does not mean that these earliest definite hominins were terrestrial all of the time. All of the australopithecines, including the later ones, seem to have been capable of climbing and moving in trees, judging by arm versus leg length and other skeletal features.30

The *australopithecines* include *A. anamensis*, *A. afarensis*, and *A. africanus.* All of them have smaller dentition and lighter facial and dental musculature than the paranthropoids (discussed below). *Australopithecus anamensis*, which may be 4.2 million years old, is the earliest australopithecine and has been found only in northern Kenya. Other hominins found in East Africa from 4 million to 3 million years ago are classified by most paleoanthropologists as belonging to the species *Australopithecus afarensis*. A few paleoanthropologists

do not think that these hominins should be placed in a separate species because they resemble the later hominin species *Australopithecus africanus*, which lived between about 3 million and 2 million years ago, primarily in southern Africa. But the temporal and spatial separation of these forms leads many paleoanthropologists to argue that they were different species.

New fossils from eastern Africa found in the last three decades suggest there may have been other species of australopithecine as well. Most scholars consider three groups of fossils in particular to represent new australopithecine species, named *Australopithecus bahrelghazali*, *Australopithecus garhi*, and *Australopithecus sediba*. *A. bahrelghazali* is currently represented by a single, fragmentary jaw; a handful of skull and limb fragments represent *A. garhi*; and two partial skeletons represent *A. sediba.* Although the finds are intriguing, we will not know how important each of these species is, or how they may change our understanding of early hominin evolution, until more fossils from them are found.

*Australopithecus garhi*, found in rock dating to approximately 2.5 million years ago, is particularly interesting, as it is similar to but is not clearly a member of any of the other australopithecine species. *A. garhi* has larger molars than *A. afarensis* yet does not have the huge face and jaws of the paranthropoids. It also lacks the enlarged brain of early *Homo*. Several limb bones were found in the same rock layers, and these do resemble *A. afarensis*. *A. garhi*, then, looks to be an *afarensis*-like creature but with greatly enlarged molars.31 It may represent one end of the range of variation in *afarensis*, or it may represent an adaptation to eating

tough foods, similar to that made by the paranthropoids, whom we will discuss shortly. It is interesting, however, that the remains of butchered animals were found in the same rock layer as the *A. garhi* remains. Several bones found near the *A. garhi* fossils show unambiguous cut marks and signs of having been broken with a stone tool. Unfortunately, no stone tools have been found, but the evidence for butchery suggests they must have been used. And since no other species of hominin have been found in the area, it is reasonable to think that *A. garhi* was the toolmaker and butcher. The fossil's discoverer, Berhane Asfaw, suggests that *A. garhi* is in the right place, at the right time, and has the right physical and behavioral traits to be the direct ancestor of early *Homo.*<sup>32</sup>

Equally intriguing is *Australopithicus sediba*. Found by Lee Burger in Malapa Cave in South Africa, the two skeletons representing *A. sediba* and dated to around 2 million years ago present a strange mix of australopithecine and early *Homo* features. While the legs and feet of *A. sediba* seem australopithecine-like, the pelvis is more like early *Homo*, as are the hands.33 The brain is smaller than other australopithecines but appears to have some features found in early *Homo*, and the teeth seem more *Homo*-like as well.34 Indeed, some have suggested that *A. sediba* may be better categorized as *Homo*, though this idea is controversial and certainly will not be resolved until more specimens are found.

Finally, *Australopithecus bahrelghazali* is interesting not so much because of its physical features but because it was found further west than any other australopithecine, in what is now central Chad. Indeed, *A. bahrelghazali* is the first early hominin to be found outside of the Rift Valley (a long valley in East Africa where the earth is pulling apart, exposing fossils from millions of years ago), and until *A. bahrelghazali* surfaced, few thought early hominins were present anywhere else. *A. bahrelghazali* dates to about 3 million years ago and is very similar to contemporary *A. afarensis* fossils from the Rift Valley. It differs from *A. afarensis* in some distinct ways (its premolars, for example, have thinner enamel and more well-defined roots), but the important difference is where *A. bahrelghazali* lived. Most scholars assume the early hominins represent a specific adaptation to the Rift Valley. The discovery of an early australopithecine some 1,550 or so miles (2,500 kilometers) west of the Rift Valley calls this assumption into question.<sup>35</sup>

A related hominin genus, *Kenyanthropus platyops*, is thought by some scholars to be yet another australopithecine (and hence should not be regarded as a separate genus). The nearly complete 3.5-million-year-old skull of *Kenyanthropus platyops* from western Kenya shows traits that Meave Leakey and her colleagues suggest separate it from the australopithecines that lived at the same time. Its face is smaller and flatter, and its molars are smaller than those of the australopithecines. Leakey believes *Kenyanthropus* may be a direct link

to *Homo*, but others are not so sure. The skull is distorted, and scholars are not convinced that its features lie outside the range of the australopithecines.36 The debate over the relation of *Kenyanthropus* to *Australopithecus* will continue until more fossils are found.

The *paranthropoids* are close relatives of the australopithecines but have larger dentition and massive faces and jaws Some paranthropoids had a ridge of bone called a *sagittal crest* on the top of their heads; the ridge anchored the heavy musculature for their large teeth and jaws. The parathropoids are so similar to the australopithecies in other ways that until recently they were known as "robust australopithecines." The earliest paranthropoid is *Paranthropus aethiopicus*, which lived in eastern Africa between 2.7 and 2.3 million years ago. Most paleoanthropologists think that the later paranthropoids, who lived between 2.3 and 1 million years ago, consist of two species: the East African species *Paranthropus boisei* and the South African species *Paranthropus robustus*.

The picture that emerges from this brief overview of the first hominins is one of diversity. There seem to have been many different species of hominins, and even within species there seems to be a relatively high level of variation.37 All shared similar environments in eastern and southern Africa, but those environments were diverse and changing. Forests were giving way to open woodlands and grasslands. Large lakes were formed and then broken apart through uplifting and volcanic activity in the Rift Valley of eastern Africa. The climate continued to warm until the end of the *Pliocene*, some 1.6 million years ago. The apparent diversity of the first hominins may reflect an *adaptive radiation* (a dispersal and divergence) of bipedal hominins to these dynamic environmental conditions.38 On the other hand, Tim White has suggested that we really do not know enough about the first hominins to judge how many species there are. He also suggests some variations may be the result of differences in the fossilization process itself.39 Whatever the cause, *diversity* seems to be the key word when thinking about the first hominins. Let's take a closer look at the diverse species of *Australopithecus* and then those of *Paranthropus*.

### Australopithecines

*Australopithecus anamensis* The earliest australopithecine species is *A. anamensis*, which has been found in several locations in northern Kenya and is dated between 3.9 million and 4.2 million years ago.40 Although there is controversy about some of the specimens included in *A. anamensis*, the general picture is that it was a small bipedal hominin with teeth similar to those of the later *A. afarensis.*41 The more controversial specimens have long bones, suggesting well-developed bipedalism, but their elbow and knee joints look more like those of the later *Homo* genus than like those of any other species of *Australopithecus.* It has been said that *A. anamensis* is "*afarensis*-like from the neck up and *Homo*-like from the neck down."<sup>42</sup>

*Australopithecus afarensis A. afarensis* is perhaps the most well-represented australopithecine species. Remains from at least two dozen individuals were unearthed at Laetoli, Tanzania.43 Although the remains there consisted largely of teeth and jaws, there is no question that the Laetoli hominins were bipedal because the now-famous trail of footprints was found at the Laetoli site. Two hominins walking erect and side by side left their tracks in the ground 3.6 million years ago. The remains of at least 35 individuals have been found at another site, Hadar, in Ethiopia. The Hadar finds are remarkable for their completeness. Whereas paleoanthropologists often find just parts of the cranium and jaws, many parts of the skeleton were also found at Hadar. For example, paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson found 40 percent of the skeleton of a female hominin he named Lucy, after the Beatles's song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."<sup>44</sup>

Dating of the hominin remains at Laetoli suggests that the hominins there lived between 3.8 million and 3.6 million years ago.45 Although Lucy and the other hominins at Hadar were once thought to be about as old as those at Laetoli, recent dating suggests that they are somewhat younger—less than 3.2 million years old. Lucy probably lived 2.9 million years ago.46 The environment Lucy lived in was semiarid, upland savanna with rainy and dry seasons.47

The existence of such extensive fossil collections has allowed paleoanthropologists such as Donald Johanson and Tim White to develop a portrait of this ancient hominin species.

*A. afarensis* was a small hominin, but, like most of the living great apes, was sexually dimorphic. Females weighed perhaps 65 pounds and stood a little more than 3 feet tall; males weighed more than 90 pounds and stood about 5 feet tall.48

*A. afarensis* teeth were large compared to their body size, and they had thick molar enamel. They also had large, apelike canines, which, on some specimens, projected beyond the adjacent teeth. However, even the longer canines did not rub against the lower teeth or fit into a diastema (a space between the teeth), and thus did not prevent side-to-side movement of the lower jaw.49 This is important because side-to-side movement of the lower jaw allowed *A. afarensis* to efficiently chew small seeds and grasses. The thick enamel on the molars and wear patterns on the molar crowns suggest that such small, tough materials made up a significant part of the diet of *A. afarensis*, though analyses of carbon isotopes (which are absorbed by the body through food) in the teeth of *A. afarensis* suggests they also ate fruits (see the box feature "You Are What You Eat").50 The cranium of *A. afarensis* reflects its dentition. The face juts forward because of the large teeth and jaws, and the base of the skull flares out to provide attachment areas for large neck muscles to support the heavy face. The brain is small, about 400 cubic centimeters (cc), but relatively large for an animal this size.51

The arms and legs of *A. afarensis* were about the same length, and the fingers and toe bones are curved, suggesting they were heavily muscled. Most scholars believe these limb proportions and strong hands and feet point to a partially arboreal lifestyle.52 In other words, it appears that *A. afarensis* spent a lot of time in the trees, probably feeding, sleeping, and avoiding terrestrial predators. The pelvis and leg bones of *A. afarensis*, however, demonstrate that it moved bipedally when on the ground. The pelvis is wide and flaring but has the bowl-like shape of all later hominins. The legs angle inward, and the feet have an arch

Mary Leakey's expedition discovered a trail about 70 yards long of 3.8-million-year-old fossilized footprints at Laetoli, Tanzania. Shown here is one part of the trail left by two adults who were clearly upright walkers. The footprints shows a well-developed arch and forward-facing big toe.

# **Current Research and Issues**

### You Are What You Eat: Chemical Analyses of Bones and Teeth

hysical anthropologists and archaeologists study ancient diets in several ways, most of them indirect. They can indirectly infer some of what ancient people ate from recovered food wastes. For example, if you find a lot of corncobs, chances are that the people ate a lot of corn. Physical anthropologists and archaeologists can also indirectly infer diet from the artifacts they find, particularly, of course, ones we can be pretty sure were used in obtaining or processing food. So, for example, if you find a stone with a flat or concave surface that looks like what people use in some places to grind corn, it is very likely that the ancient people also ground grain (or other hard things such as seeds) for food. But plant remains or implements do not tell us exactly how much people relied on particular sources of food.

There is a more direct way to study ancient diets. Anthropologists have discovered that in many ways "you are what you eat." In particular, chemical analyses of bones and teeth, the most common remains found in

excavations, can reveal distinctive traces of the foods that metabolically went into the bones and teeth.

One kind of informative chemical analysis involves the ratio of strontium to calcium in bone. This analysis can indicate the relative amounts of plant and animal food in the diet. So, for example, we know from strontium analysis of bones that just before the beginnings of cereal agriculture in the Near East, people were eating a lot of plant food, probably wild cereals that were intensively collected. Then there was a temporary decline in such collecting, suggesting overexploitation of the wild resources or at least their decreasing availability. This problem was presumably solved by the cultivation and domestication (modification) of cereals.

Carbon isotope ratios also can tell us what types of plants people were eating. Trees, shrubs, and temperate-zone grasses (e.g., rice) have carbon isotope ratios that are different from those of tropical and subtropical grasses (such as millet and corn). People in China were

relying heavily on cereals about 7,000 to 8,000 years ago, but the cereals were not the same in the north and south. Contrary to what we might expect, the carbon isotope ratios tell us that an originally temperate-zone cereal (rice) was the staple in subtropical southern China; in the more temperate north, an originally tropical or subtropical grass (millet) was most important. The dependence on millet in the north was enormous.

Nonchemical analyses of human bones and teeth were traditionally used by physical anthropologists and archaeologists to study similarities and differences between peoples in different geographic regions, between living humans and possible fossil ancestors, and between living humans and other surviving primates. In recent years, physical anthropologists and archaeologists have begun to study the "insides" of bones and teeth. The new kinds of chemical analysis mentioned here are part of that trend.

and an ankle much like later hominins.<sup>53</sup> Detailed analyses of the Laetoli footprints suggest that *A. afarensis* may have had a shorter and less efficient stride than modern humans.<sup>54</sup>

Although A. afarensis is the most well-represented australopithecine species, it was not the first one discovered. That distinction rests with Australopithecus africanus.

**Australopithecus africanus** In 1925, Raymond Dart, professor of anatomy at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, presented the first evidence that an erect bipedal hominin existed in the Pliocene epoch. As he separated bones from a matrix of material found in the Taung cave on the edge of the Kalahari Desert, Dart realized he was looking at more than the remains of an ape. He described the experience:

On December 23, [1924,] the rock parted. I could view the face from the front, although the right side was still embedded. The creature that had contained this massive brain was no giant anthropoid such as a gorilla. What emerged was a baby's face, an infant with a full set of milk teeth and its permanent molars just in the process of erupting.<sup>55</sup>

By the teeth, Dart identified the fossil as the remains of a 5- to 7-yearold child (although recent analysis by electron microscope suggests that the child was no more than  $3\frac{1}{2}^{56}$ ). He named the specimen *Australopithe*cus africanus, which means "southern ape of Africa." Dart was certain the skull was that of a bipedal animal. He based his conclusion on the fact that the foramen magnum faced downward, indicating that the head was carried directly over the spine. Furthermore, the Taung child's incisors and canine teeth were short and therefore definitely more human- than apelike.

Dart's conclusion met with widespread skepticism and opposition. Not the least of the problems was that scientists at the time believed hominins had originated in Asia. But there were probably other reasons: Dart had found only one fossil; it was an infant rather than an adult; and no other hominin fossils had yet been found in Africa. Other australopithecines were not discovered until the 1930s, when Robert Broom recovered some fossils from the Sterkfontein cave near Johannesburg. Dart's and Broom's conclusions did not begin to be accepted until after 1945, when Wilfred Le Gros Clark, a professor of anatomy at Oxford, supported the hominin status of their finds.57

Since the Taung child's discovery 90 years ago, the remains of hundreds of other similar australopithecines have been unearthed from caves at Sterkfontein and Makapansgat in South Africa. From this abundant evidence, a fairly complete picture of *A. africanus* can be drawn: "The brain case is rounded with a relatively well-developed forehead. Moderate brow ridges surmount a rather projecting face."58 The estimated cranial capacity for the various finds from Taung and Sterkfontein is between 428 and 485 cc.59

Like *A. afarensis*, *A. africanus* was very small; the adults were 31⁄2 to 41⁄2 feet tall, weighed 60 to 90 pounds, and were sexually dimorphic.60 The large, chinless jaw of *A. africanus* resembles that of *A. afarensis*, but some of the dental features of *A. africanus* are similar to those of modern humans—broad incisors and small, short canines. And although the premolars and molars were larger than in modern humans, their form was very similar. Presumably, function and use were also similar.

Dating of the australopithecine finds from the South African limestone caves is somewhat difficult because none of the absolute dating techniques can be applied. But relative dating is possible. Comparisons of the fauna found in the strata with fauna found elsewhere suggest that the South African *A. africanus* lived between 3 million and 2 million years ago. The climate was probably semiarid, not too different from the climate of today.61

### Paranthropoids

The paranthropoids lived in eastern Africa and in southern Africa from about 2.7 million to 1 million years ago and are distinct from the australopithecines in a number of ways. However, they share enough similarities that until recently they were classified as "robust australopithecines." Paranthropoids were found first in South African caves, in Kromdraai and in Swartkrans, and later in East Africa, in the Omo Basin in Ethiopia, on the east and west sides of Lake Turkana in Kenya, and Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania.62 Most paleoanthropologists classify the South African paranthropoids from about 1.8 million to 1 million years ago as *P. robustus* and the East African robust forms from 2.3 million to 1.3 million years ago as *P. boisei*. 63 The third robust species, *P. aethiopicus*, is even earlier, dating back more than 2.5 million years ago, and may have been ancestral to *P. boisei*.

In contrast to the australopithecines, the paranthropoids had thicker jaws, with larger molars and premolars but smaller incisors, more massive muscle attachments for chewing, and well-developed sagittal crests and ridges to support heavy chewing.64 In addition, *P. robustus* and *P. boisei* have somewhat larger cranial capacities (about 490–530 cc) than any of the australopithecines.

It used to be thought that the paranthropoids were substantially bigger than the australopithecines, but recent calculations suggest that the paranthropoids were not substantially different in body weight or height from the australopithecines. Their robustness is primarily in the skull and jaw, most strikingly in the teeth. If the paranthropoids were larger in body size, their slightly bigger brain capacity would not be surprising because larger animals generally have larger brains. However, the body of

the paranthropoids is similar to that of *A. africanus*, so the brain of the paranthropoids was relatively larger than the brain of *A. africanus.*<sup>65</sup>

*Paranthropus aethiopicus P. aethiopicus* is the earliest and also the least known of the paranthropoids. *P. aethiopicus* is represented by a small group of fossils found in northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia dating between 2.3 million and 2.7 million years ago, including one spectacular find—a nearly complete skull (known as the "Black Skull" because of its dark color) found in 1985.66 Even though we have only a few fossils, it seems clear that *P. aethiopicus* was quite different from other australopithecines. They differ from *A. afarensis* specimens from roughly the same region and perhaps even the same time period by having much larger dentition, particularly molars; huge cheekbones; projecting and dish-shaped (round and flat) faces; and large sagittal crests. But they are similar to *A. afarensis* in most other ways. Overall, *P. aethiopicus* resembles *A. afarensis* with a massively "scaled-up" dental apparatus.67

*Paranthropus robustus* In 1936, Robert Broom, then curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Transvaal Museum in South Africa, began visiting quarries seeking fossils for the museum, particularly hominins that might support Raymond Dart's earlier discovery of the Taung child. In 1938, a quarry manager gave Broom a hominin jaw that had been found in a nearby cave called Kromdraai. Broom immediately began excavating in the cave and within days was able to piece together the skull of what would prove to be a new species— *Paranthropus robustus.*<sup>68</sup>

Although Broom had expected another example of *Australopithecus africanus* (he had found an *A. africanus* skull in 1936), this one was different. It had larger teeth, a massive jaw, and a flatter face than *A. africanus.*69 Indeed, after further study, Broom decided that the fossil represented an entirely new hominin genus: *Paranthropus.* Broom's genus designation was not widely accepted at the time (scholars thought the specimen represented a species of *Australopithecus*), but as we noted earlier, many scholars today believe the paranthropoids are unique enough to warrant classification in a separate *Paranthropus* genus.

During the 1940s, Broom added many new fossils of *P. robustus* and *A. africanus* to the collections of the Transvaal Museum. But his discoveries also raised a problem. How did two strikingly different hominin species evolve in the same environment? In 1954, John T. Robinson proposed that *A. africanus* and *P. robustus* had different dietary adaptations—*A. africanus* being an omnivore (dependent on meat and plants) and *P. robustus* a vegetarian, with a need for heavy chewing. Robinson's view was hotly debated for many years, but recent evidence from electron microscopy and the analysis of

![](_page_13_Picture_6.jpeg)

Why was *P. robustus* so different from *A. africanus?* One possibility is that they lived in a more open, savanna-like environment and ate relatively more grasses than *A. africanus.* At any rate, most paleoanthropologists think that *P. robustus* died out shortly after 1 million years ago71 and is not ancestral to our own genus, *Homo.*<sup>72</sup>

*Paranthropus boisei* Legendary paleoanthropologist Louis Leakey began his search for a human ancestor in 1931 at Olduvai Gorge in western Tanzania. It was not until 1959 that his efforts paid off with the discovery of *Paranthropus boisei* (named after a benefactor, Charles Boise). The nearly 30 years that Leakey, his wife Mary Leakey, and their children (including paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey) worked at Olduvai before finding *P. boisei* were not wasted. The Leakeys assembled a rich collection of nonhominin fossils and established a detailed understanding of the ancient environment of the region.73 So, on a hot July morning, when Mary Leakey rushed to tell Louis, who was sick in bed, that she had discovered the hominin they had long been searching for, the Leakeys were able immediately to place their find into a rich environmental context.

The discovery of *P. boisei* was particularly important because it demonstrated that early hominins were present in East Africa. Until the Leakeys found *P. boisei*, it was thought that South Africa was the

homeland of the hominins. Indeed, Leakey initially assigned *P. boisei* to a new genus—*Zinjanthropus*—to highlight its location (*Zinj* means "East Africa" in Arabic). Today, we know that the most ancient fossil hominins are all found in East Africa, but in 1959, simply finding a fossil hominin in East Africa was remarkable.

What did *P. boisei* look like? Compared with *P. robustus*, *P. boisei* had even more extreme features that reflected a huge chewing apparatus—enormous molar teeth and expanded premolars that look like molars; a massive, thick, and deep jaw; thick cheekbones; and a more pronounced sagittal crest.74 Indeed, *P. boisei* has been called "hyper-robust"—a phrase that definitely captures the species.

*P. boisei* lived between about 2.3 million and 1.3 million years ago. Like *P. robustus*, it seems to have lived in a dry, open environment and ate a lot of coarse seeds, nuts, and roots. And, like *P. robustus*, most paleoanthropologists think *P. boisei* is not ancestral to our genus, *Homo.*<sup>75</sup>

# One Model of Human Evolution

At this point, you may well be wondering how all these species fit together. Figure 6.4 shows one model entertained by paleoanthropologists about how the known fossils may be related. The main disagreement among paleontologists concerns which species of *Australopithecus* were ancestral to the line leading to modern humans. For example, the model shown in Figure 6.4 suggests that *A. africanus* is not ancestral to *Homo*, only to one line of paranthropoids. *Australopithecus afarensis* is viewed as ancestral to both lines of paranthropoids and to the line leading to modern humans. Those who think that *A. afarensis* was the last common ancestor of all the hominin lines shown in Figure 6.4 think the split to *Homo* occurred over 3 million years ago.76

Despite the uncertainty and disagreements about what species was ancestral to the *Homo* line, paleoanthropologists widely agree about other aspects of early hominin evolution: (1) There were at least two

separate hominin lines between 3 million and 1 million years ago; (2) the paranthropoids were not ancestral to modern humans but became extinct about 1 million years ago; and (3) *Homo habilis* (and successive *Homo* species) were in the direct ancestral line to modern humans.

6.4 Explain one model of human evolution.

# Summary and Review

### The Evolution of Bipedal Locomotion

6.1 Evaluate theories for the evolution of bipedal locomotion.

- • Bipedal locomotion, or walking on two legs, was perhaps the most crucial change in early hominin evolution. The available fossil record confirms that bipedal hominins emerged in Africa, but how quickly it emerged is unclear.
- • The drying trend in climate that began about 16 million to 11 million years ago diminished the extent of

African rain forests and gave rise to areas of savanna (grasslands) and scattered deciduous woodlands.

*Source*: Adapted from The New York Times, September 5, 1995, p. C9. Dates changed slightly to reflect recent redating.

- • Several theories try to explain the development of bipedalism: (1) bipedalism may have increased the emerging hominins' ability to see predators and potential prey; (2) it may have freed up hands, thus facilitating the transfer of food from one place to another; (3) it may have been linked to tool use; (4) it may have made long-distance traveling more efficient; and (5) it might have enabled hominins to regulate body temperature.
- • Any advantages of bipedalism must be greater than the disadvantages. Bipedalism makes it harder to overcome

Choosing two theories, how do they explain the evolution of bipedal locomotion? Evaluate the theories. What specific anatomical changes were required for early hominoids to become habitually bipedal?

### The Transition from Hominoids to Hominins

6.2 Identify species involved in the transition from hominoids to hominins.

- • The fossil record between 8 and 6 million years back is relatively sparse which makes the transition from hominoids to hominins difficult to pinpoint.
- • The candidates for transitional species and possibly the first hominins are *Sahelanthropus* (7 million years ago), *Orrorin* (5.8–6 million years ago), and *Ardipithecus* (5.8–4.4 million years *ago*).

![](_page_15_Picture_8.jpeg)

Among the current possible candidates to be recognized as the first hominin, why is *Ardipithecus* unique?

# The First Definite Hominins

6.3 Describe the distinctive traits of hominins.

• Undisputed hominins dating before 4 million years ago have been found in East Africa. These definitely bipedal hominins are now generally classified in the genus *Australopithecus*.

- • At least six species of early hominins have been identified, and these are generally divided into two types: australopithecines and paranthropoids.
- • The large number of suggested australopithecine and paranthropoid species indicates that diversity was prevalent among early hominins. One idea about the apparent diversity of the first hominins may reflect an adaptive radiation (a dispersal and divergence) of bipedal hominins to these dynamic environmental conditions.
- • The australopithecines have relatively smaller teeth and jaws and include *A. anamensis*, *A. afarensis*, and *A. africanus*. The paranthropoids have relatively larger teeth and jaws and are more muscular than the australopithecines. They include*P. aethiopicus*, *P. robustus*, and *P. boisei.*

What are three distinctive traits of hominins?

## One Model of Human Evolution

- 6.4 Explain one model of human evolution.
- • The last common ancestor of our genus *Homo* was likely one of the australopithecines.
- • Paranthropoids appear to represent an evolutionary lineage of hominins that went extinct about a million years ago.

What three aspects of early hominin evolution are widely accepted?

# Think on it

- 1. What behavioral changes may have accompanied the evolution of bipedal locomotion?
- 2. How could there have been more than one species of hominin living in East Africa at the same time? Given the huge variation within *homo sapiens*, how can researchers be sure that the various fossils of earlier hominins they examine are, indeed, distinct species?
- 3. What may have enabled australopithecines to survive in the face of many ground predators?
- 4. What evolutionary processes can you envision that may have led the early hominins to divide into two major types: australopithecines and paranthropoids?
