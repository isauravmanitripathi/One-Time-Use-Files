Practicing or applied anthropology The

branch of anthropology that concerns itself with applying anthropological knowledge to achieve practical goals, usually in the service of an agency outside the traditional academic setting

#### Development anthropology One of the main subfields of applied or practicing anthropol-

ogy, aimed at improving people's lives, particularly decreasing poverty and hunger.

25.1 Discuss the ethical code of applied anthropology and discuss the ethical issues faced by practicing anthropologists.

nthropology is no longer a merely academic subject. A large number of anthropologists in the United States are applied and practicing anthropologists, employed outside of colleges and universities.<sup>1</sup> The fact that so many organizations hire anthropologists suggests an increasing realization that anthropology, what it has discovered and can discover about humans, is useful. Anthropologists who call themselves practicing or applied anthropologists work for a large variety of organizations, government agencies, international development agencies, private consulting firms, public health organizations, medical schools, public-interest law firms, community development agencies, charitable foundations, and profit-seeking corporations.

**Practicing or applied anthropology** as a profession is explicitly concerned with making anthropological knowledge useful. Applied or practicing anthropologists may be involved in one or more phases of a project: assembling relevant knowledge and collecting data, developing plans and policies, assessing the likely social and environmental impacts, implementation, and evaluating the project and its effects.<sup>2</sup> Anthropologists are most often involved in gathering information rather than constructing policy or initiating action.<sup>3</sup> The organizations that hire the applied anthropologists usually set policy and have staff to execute projects. However, anthropologists are increasingly finding themselves involved in policy making and action. The field of applied or practicing anthropology is very diverse. In this chapter, we first focus on issues affecting applied anthropology generally: ethics; evaluating the effects of planned change; and the difficulties of implementing change. In these first sections, we mainly use examples from *development anthropology*, one of the oldest applied fields. **Development anthropology** is one of the main subfields of applied or practicing anthropology, aimed at improving people's lives, particularly decreasing poverty and hunger.<sup>4</sup> We then turn to some other applied specialties such as *environmental* anthropology, business or organizational anthropology, museum anthropology, cultural re*source management*, and *forensic anthropology*. Medical anthropology, which has both basic and applied aspects, is discussed in its own chapter. These fields by no means exhaust the wide-ranging applications in which anthropologists participate.

## Ethics of Applied Anthropology

Anthropologists have usually studied people who are disadvantaged—by imperialism, colonialism, and other forms of exploitation—and so it is no wonder that we care about the people's lives we have shared. But caring is not enough to improve others' lives. We may need basic research that allows us to understand how a condition might be successfully treated. A particular proposed "improvement" might actually not be an improvement; well-meaning efforts have sometimes produced harmful consequences. And even if we know that a change would be an improvement, there is still the problem of how to make that change happen. The people to be affected may not want to change. Is it ethical to try to persuade them? And, conversely, is it ethical *not* to try? Applied anthropologists must take all of these matters into consideration in determining whether and how to act in response to a perceived need.

Anthropology as a profession has adopted certain principles of responsibility. Above all, an anthropologist's first responsibility is to those who are being studied; everything should be done to ensure that their welfare and dignity will be protected. Anthropologists also have a responsibility to those who will read about their research; research findings should be reported openly and truthfully.<sup>5</sup> But because applied anthropology often deals with planning and implementing changes in some population, ethical responsibilities can become complicated. Perhaps the most important ethical question is: Will the change truly benefit the potentially affected population?

In May 1946, the Society for Applied Anthropology established a committee to draw up a specific code of ethics for professional applied anthropologists. After many meetings and revisions, a statement on ethical responsibilities was finally adopted in 1948 and revised subsequently.6 According to the code, the targeted community should be included as much as possible in the formulation of policy, so that people in the community may know in advance how the program will affect them. Perhaps the most important aspect of the code is the pledge not to recommend or take any action that is harmful to the interests of the community. The National Association for the Practice of Anthropology goes further: If the work the employer expects of the employee violates the ethical principles of the profession, the practicing anthropologist has the obligation to try to change those practices or, if change cannot be brought about, to withdraw from the work.7

Ethical issues are often complicated. Thayer Scudder described the situation of Gwembe Tonga villagers who were relocated after a large dam was built in the Zambezi Valley of central Africa. Economic conditions improved during the 1960s and early 1970s as the people increasingly produced goods and services for sale. But then conditions deteriorated. By 1980, the villagers were in a miserable state; rates of mortality, alcoholism, theft, assault, and murder were up. Why? One reason was that they had cut back on producing their own food in favor of producing for the world market. Such a strategy works well when world market prices are high; however, when prices fall, so does the standard of living.8 The situation described by Scudder illustrates the ethical dilemma for many applied anthropologists. As he said: "So how is it that I can still justify working for the agencies that fund such projects?" He points out that large-scale projects are almost impossible to stop. The anthropologist can choose to stand on the sidelines and complain or try to influence the project to benefit the affected population as much as possible.9 Along these lines, Michael Cernea has modeled eight risks of displacement due to water projects, which include landlessness, joblessness, homelessness, marginalization, food insecurity, increased morbidity, loss of access to common property resources, and community disarticulation.10 He asserts that all these risks make it important to avoid resettlement, but if it is undertaken there needs to be serious political commitment by governments to provide adequate resources and legal protections.

Many development projects, particularly large-scale projects such as building dams or urban renewal projects, inevitably involve the large-scale displacement of people. About 10 million people a year are displaced by such projects. Whose lives are improved? The ethical difficulty is that some lives may be improved and others worsened. While a development project may claim to increase economic growth for a region or country as a whole, it usually results in much worse conditions for the people displaced by it. It is almost always the case that the people immediately affected do not wish to relocate. And the people forced to move are invariably less powerful because they are poor or have minority status.

Some of the problems result from the fact that anthropologists are not often involved until after a decision is made to go ahead with a change program. This situation has begun to change as applied anthropologists are increasingly asked to participate in earlier stages of the planning process. Anthropologists are also increasingly asked to help in projects initiated by the affected party. Such requests may range from help in solving problems in corporate organizations to helping Native Americans with land claims. Because the project is consistent with the wishes of the affected population, the results are not likely to put the anthropologist into an ethical dilemma.

When physical anthropologists and archaeologists work with skeletal and even fossil materials, the ethical complications can become extremely complex. Consider the case of "Kennewick Man," a 9,200-year-old skeleton found in July 1996 along the Columbia River in Washington State. Before anthropologists could study the skeleton, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decided to turn the remains over to the Umatilla Indians, as the remains were found on Corps land within their reservation. The physical anthropologists and archaeologists who wanted to study this very old skeleton faced an ethical quandary: A group claiming to be related to the individual did not want the study to be undertaken, but, without the study, the group's claim of relationship could not be firmly established.11 The physical anthropologists and archaeologists filed a lawsuit under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1900, which provides absolute protection to Native American graves on federal land and which makes it a felony to collect, possess, or transfer human remains of known affinity to an existing Native American culture, except if approved by the members of that culture.12

## Applied Anthropology

#### **Getting Development Programs to Include Women Farmers**

hen Anita Spring first did fieldwork in Zambia in the 1970s, she was not particularly interested in agriculture. Rather, medical anthropology was her interest. Her work focused on customary healing practices, particularly involving women and children. She was surprised at the end of the year when a delegation of women came to tell her that she did not understand what it meant to be a woman. "To be a woman is to be a farmer," they said. She admits that it took her a while to pay attention to women as farmers, but then she began to participate in efforts to provide technical assistance to them. Spring realized that all too often development agents downplay women's contributions to agriculture.

How does one bring about change in male-centered attitudes and practices? One way is to document how much women actually contribute to agriculture. Beginning with the influential writing of Ester Boserup in Woman's Role in Economic Development (1970), scholars began to report that in Africa south of the Sahara, in the Caribbean, and in parts of Southeast Asia, women were the principal farmers or agricultural laborers. Moreover, as agriculture became more complex, it required more work time in the fields, so the women's contribution to agriculture increased. In addition, because men increasingly went away to work, women

![](_page_3_Picture_5.jpeg)

had to do much of what used to be men's work on the farms.

In the 1980s, Spring designed and directed the Women in Agricultural Development Project in Malawi, funded by the Office of Women in the U.S. Agency for International Development. Rather than focusing just on women, the project aimed to collect data on both female and male agriculturalists and how development agents treated them. The project did more than collect information; mini-projects were set up and evaluated, and successful training techniques were shared with development

agents in other regions. Spring points out that the success of the program was due not just to the design of the project but to Malawi's willingness to change. It also helped that the United Nations and other donor organizations increasingly focused attention on women. It takes the efforts of many to bring about change. Increasingly, applied anthropologists like Anita Spring are involved in these efforts from beginning to end, from the design stage to implementation and evaluation.

At the core of the legal case was this question: To whom does this skeleton belong? If this is an individual who is related to contemporary Native Americans, then do the Umatilla get to speak for all Native American groups, even though 9,000 years separate them? Or should other Native American groups, who may also be descended from this individual or his group, also have a say in what happens? If this is an individual who appears not to be related to contemporary Native Americans, then should the U.S. government decide what happens to his remains? Underlying these questions was a deeper struggle between anthropologists and Native Americans over historic preservation and whose wishes and ideas carry the most weight. Archaeologists and physical anthropologists feel ethical responsibilities that can be in conflict when dealing with human remains. As part of the archaeological record, archaeologists and physical anthropologists have an ethical responsibility to protect and preserve human remains. As anthropologists, they have the ethical responsibility to consult with and follow the wishes of local groups with whom they are working. The Kennewick Man case highlights this ethical conflict, for which there seems no easy answer.

## Evaluating the Effects of Planned Change

The decision as to whether a proposed change would benefit the affected population is not always easy to make. In certain cases, as when improved medical care is involved, the benefits offered to the target group would seem to be unquestionable—we all feel sure that health is better than illness. However, what about the long-term effects? Consider a public health innovation such as inoculation against disease. Once the inoculation program was begun, the number of children surviving would probably increase. But will there be enough food for the additional population? Given the level of technology, capital, and land resources possessed by the population, there might not be enough resources to feed more people. Thus, the death rate, because of starvation, might rise to its previous level and perhaps even exceed it. Without additional changes to increase the food supply, the inoculation program in the long term might merely change the causes of death. This example shows that even if a program of planned change has beneficial consequences in the short run, a great deal of thought and investigation has to be given to its long-term effects.

Debra Picchi raised questions about the long-term effects on the Bakairí Indians of a program by the Brazilian National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) to produce rice with machine technology.13 The Bakairí of the Mato Grosso region largely practice slash-andburn horticulture in gallery forests along rivers, with supplementary cattle raising, fishing, and hunting. In the early part of the 20th century, their population had declined to 150 people, and they were given a relatively small reserve, much of it parched and infertile (*cerrado*). When the Bakairí population began to increase, FUNAI introduced a scheme to plant rice on formerly unused *cerrado* land, using machinery, insecticides, and fertilizer. FUNAI paid the costs for the first year and expected that the scheme would be selfsupporting by the third year. The project did not go so well because FUNAI did not deliver all the equipment needed and did not provide adequate advice. Only half the expected rice was produced. Still, it was more food than the Bakairí had previously, so the program should have been beneficial to them.

But there were unanticipated negative side effects. Using *cerrado* land for agriculture reduced the area on which cattle could be grazed; cattle are an important source of highquality protein. Mechanization also makes the Bakairí more dependent on cash for fuel, insecticides, fertilizer, and repairs. But cash is hard to come by. Only some individuals can be hired—usually men with outside experience who have the required knowledge of machinery. So the cash earned in the now-mechanized agriculture goes mainly to a relatively small number of people, creating new inequalities of income.

The benefits of programs or applied efforts are sometimes obvious. For example, Haiti has experienced serious deforestation. The process began in colonial times when the Spanish exported wood and the French cleared forests to grow sugarcane, coffee, and indigo. After Haiti's independence, foreign lumber companies continued to cut and sell hardwood. Wood is needed by the local population for fuel and for construction, but rapid population increases have increased the demand for fuel and wood, and the trees were rapidly diminishing. The loss of tree cover also speeds up erosion of topsoil. Forestry experts, environmentalists, and anthropologists all agree about the need to stop this trend. How to bring about the appropriate change is not so easy. The poorer people become, the more likely they are to cut down trees to sell.14

These failures were not the fault of anthropologists—indeed, most instances of planned change by governments and other agencies usually have begun without the input of anthropologists at all. Applied anthropologists have played an important role in pointing out the problems with programs like these that fail to evaluate long-term consequences. Such evaluations are an important part of convincing governments and other agencies to ask for anthropological help in the first place. Ironically, failure experiences are learning experiences: Applied anthropologists who study previous examples of planned change can often learn a great deal about what is likely or not likely to be beneficial in the long run.

25.2 Discuss the need to evaluate the effects of planned change.

25.3 Identify and give examples of some difficulties in implementing planned change.

### Difficulties in Instituting Planned Change

After numerous reforestation projects failed in Haiti, an anthropologist, Gerald Murray, was asked to help design a program that would work.15 Understanding why previous projects failed was the first step in helping Murray design an effective project. One problem seems to have been that previous projects were run through the government's Ministry of Agriculture. The seedling trees that were given away were referred to as "the state's trees." So when project workers told farmers not to cut the new trees down so as to protect the environment, farmers took this statement to mean that the land on which the trees were planted might be considered government land, which the farmers could not care less about. In the project proposed by Murray, private voluntary organizations rather than the Haitian government were used to distribute trees and the farmers were told that they were the tree owners. Ownership included the right to cut the trees and sell the wood, just as they could sell crops. In previous projects, farmers were given heavy, hard-to-transport seedlings that took a long time to mature. They were told to plant in a large communal woodlot, an idea inconsistent with the more individualistic Haitian land tenure arrangements. In the new plan, the tree seedlings given away were fast-growing species that matured in as little as four years. In addition, the new seedlings were very small and could be planted quickly. Perhaps most important of all, the new trees could be planted in borders or interspersed with other crops, interfering little with traditional crop patterns. To Murray's great surprise, by the end of two years, 2,500 Haitian households had planted 3 million seedlings. Over 20 years, the estimate is that over a 100 million trees were planted and over 350,000 farm families were involved in the project, more than 40 percent of rural households.16 Also, farmers were not rushing to cut down trees. Because growing trees do not spoil, farmers were postponing their cutting and sale until they needed cash. So even though farmers were told that it was all right to cut down trees, a statement contrary to the message of previous reforestation projects, the landscape was filling up with trees.

Murray's lengthy participant observation and interviewing had helped him predict what might overcome the previous implementation difficulties and fit in with the Haitian farmers' needs. The idea that wood could be an important marketable cash crop was much more consistent with farmers' existing behavior—they already sold crops for cash when they needed it. The difference now was that, instead of cutting down naturally grown wood, they were raising wood just as they raised other crops.

Whether a program of planned change can be successfully implemented depends largely on whether the people want the proposed change and like the proposed program. Before an attempt can be made at cultural innovation, the innovators must determine whether the population is aware of the benefits of the proposed change. Lack of awareness can be a temporary barrier to solving the problem at hand. For example, health workers have often had difficulty convincing people that they were becoming ill because something was wrong with their water supply. Many people do not believe that disease can be transmitted by water. At other times, the population is perfectly aware of the problem. A case in point involved Taiwanese women who were introduced to family-planning methods beginning in the 1960s. The women knew they were having more children than they wanted or could easily afford, and they wanted to control their birth rate. They offered no resistance—they merely had to be given the proper devices and instructions, and the birth rate quickly fell to a more desirable, and more manageable, level.17

#### Anthropologists as Advocates and Collaborators

Development anthropologists have played an important role researching and documenting the mostly negative effects on populations that have been relocated. Occasionally, a few projects have had better outcomes, and researchers try to understand what factors appear to ameliorate the situation. Two factors critical to success appear to be collecting good data in affected communities prior to the project and consulting with the community.

In the past, anthropologists mostly played a role in researching change projects. There were some notable exceptions however. For example, in the 1950s Sol Tax advocated

"action anthropology, which emphasized the role of the anthropologist in helping communities make choices and decide how they want to change."18 One famous action-oriented project (the Vicos Project) led by Cornell anthropologists actually took over a hacienda in Peru with the aim of transforming the serf-like system into one where the indigenous population controlled the resources and ran the community.19 For a long time those projects were exceptions. However, in the 1990s anthropologists have increasingly become advocates for affected communities, working with NGOs to resist resettlement or to lobby for better conditions. Advocates see themselves as providing a voice that is not otherwise heard. Critics are concerned that the advocate is only representing one point of view.

Even if the programs are well intentioned and even if the appropriate evaluations are made to ensure that the population will not be seriously harmed, the population targeted for the change is usually not involved in the decision making. Some anthropologists think that collaborative research is more ethical because it involves the people affected in all phases of the project, from participating in the research design to execution and publishing.20 Wayne Warry decided to be more collaborative when he was asked by a Native Canadian elder whether he (Warry) would tolerate his own methods and interpretations if he were the native.21 This question prompted him to involve himself in a project with Native Canadian collaborators, directed by the Mamaweswen Tribal Council. The project assesses health care needs and develops plans to improve local community health care. Funding is provided by the Canadian government as part of a program to transfer health care to the First Nations. Native researchers are conducting the surveys and workshops to keep the community informed about the project. The tribal council also reviews any publications and shares in any profits resulting from those

publications. Applied anthropologists are also increasingly asked to work on behalf of indigenous grassroots organizations which have proliferated recently in the developing world. In some cases, these small groups and networks of such groups are starting to hire their own technical assistance.22 When such organizations do the hiring, they control the decision making. There is increasing evidence that grassroots organizations are the key to effective development. For example, Kenyan farmers who belong to grassroots organizations produce higher farm yields than those farmers who do not belong, even though the latter group is exposed to more agricultural extension agents.23 Grassroots organizations can succeed where government or outside projects fail. We have plenty of instances of people effectively resisting projects. Their willingness to change, and their participation in crucial decision making, may be mostly responsible for the success of a change project.

Large development projects planned by powerful governments or agencies rarely are stoppable, but even they can be resisted successfully. The Kayapo of the Xingu River region of Brazil were able to cancel a plan by the Brazilian government to build dams along the river for hydroelectric power. The Kayapo gained international attention when some of their leaders appeared on North American and European television and then successfully organized a protest, in 1989, by members of several tribal groups. Their success seemed to come in part from their ability to present themselves to the international community as guardians of the rain forest—an image that resonated with international environmental organizations that supported their cause. Although to outsiders it might seem that the Kayapo want their way of life to remain as it was, the Kayapo are not opposed to all change. In fact, they want greater access to medical care, other government services, and manufactured goods from outside.<sup>24</sup>

There is another kind of collaboration that is becoming increasingly important. Many projects require team efforts, working with people from other disciplines. Anthropologists increasingly have to be conversant with the theory and methods in other fields to understand and negotiate with other members of their team. Earlier anthropologists might have been more likely to work alone. Now that is less likely.25

Native South Americans from different groups gather to show their unity as they protest against the construction of the Belo Montedam. They are demanding that the Brazilian government hold prior consultations with indigenous peoples before building dams that affect their lands and livelihoods.

25.4 Describe the field of environmental anthropology.

#### **environmental**

**anthropology** It focuses on issues relating to the interaction of humans with their environments, at the local, regional, and global levels, particularly on how to understand and alleviate the degradation of the environment.

### Environmental Anthropology

Given the looming environmental challenges that humans face, it is not surprising that *environmental anthropology* has become a rapidly growing field. The field of **environmental anthropology** focuses on issues relating to the interaction of humans with their environments, at the local, regional and global levels, particularly focusing on how to understand and alleviate the degradation of the environment.26 Researchers ask questions such as: How do local people view the environment? What are the effects of those views? How can needed resources be sustained? Does participation by communities in change programs lead to better outcomes? What kinds of programs can help to improve the lives of those living in the worst environments?

There is increasing recognition that imposition of environmental policies from the top down does not work very well and that efforts are more likely to succeed if the affected communities participate in the planning of programs. Erin Dean describes a pilot program in Tanzania to manage forest resources that attempts to be participatory.27 Tanzania has about 2 million hectares of land under some participatory management program. There are two kinds of forestry management programs. In one, the government retains ownership of the forestland and trees, but responsibilities and benefits are shared with communities. In the second one, communities register for full ownership of the forestland and trees as well as full responsibility. The Meru-Usa plantation, on the upper slopes of Mount Meru, has its roots in colonial times when the Germans seized land for European settlement and at the same time created a forest reserve. Because of land seizures, the agricultural Masai living in this area had to intensify their agriculture. But this did not solve the Masai's need for timber because agricultural intensification deprived the Masai of timber that would formerly grow in fields that lay fallow. Consequently, the forest reserve became contested. And, to make matters worse, the trees that were planted in the reserve used more water than native trees. To deal with the increased tension, the manager of the Meru-Usa plantation decided to try to get village cooperation, and the Tanzanian government decided to make it a pilot program. Masai farmers help weed in areas where young trees are growing and in exchange are allowed to collect fallen limbs and plant some crops until the trees grow tall enough and make too much shade. The pilot project also included school environmental programs and lessons in some revenue-generating projects, such as bee-keeping. While progress has occurred, Dean reports that co-management was a goal but was not yet achieved.

Much of the work that environmental anthropologists do is at the local level where they can employ detailed ethnographic methods. But when the environmental issue in-

![](_page_7_Picture_8.jpeg)

A promising technology in arid areas is drip irrigation where water is applied in droplets near the plant's root zone through small tubes. A Masai group living near the Kenya-Tanzanian border are observing.

volves a large region, this strategy does not work well because a single community or even a few communities will not provide representative information. Researchers make use of methods such as remote sensing from satellites combined with geographic information systems (GISs) for a large region. Satellite data, which can be geo-referenced using GIS, can be analyzed for changes in vegetation.28 But these technological advances alone are not sufficient, for without research on the ground, scientists cannot be sure how the land is used now and in the past. For instance, they would want to know whether land was previously burned, or when the land was last logged, what species of tree have been cut, how many people live in a household, or how households allocate labor. In other words, "ground-truthing" is needed. This is where anthropology comes in. Working with interdisciplinary teams, smaller units of land can be sampled, and fieldworkers can talk to people in those areas to find out how land was actually used and who lives on the land.

The example just given indicates how anthropologists need to interface with other methods and

people from other disciplines to tackle more than local problems. But that does not mean that local knowledge is irrelevant. Climate change is a worldwide phenomenon, yet environmental anthropologists believe that understanding the resilience of local communities and their resourcefulness is necessary. As described by Jennifer Hirsch and colleagues, the Field Museum in Chicago is undertaking research in 10 Chicago neighborhoods designed to facilitate the involvement of different communities in reducing carbon emissions.29 If successful, community leaders will participate in long-term planning for their communities and the larger area. The research team consists of anthropologists, Chicago Department of Environment staff, and community leaders. The anthropologists employed mixed methods, including about 4 months of ethnographic research in each community, to assess concerns about climate change and steps people were taking to conserve energy. They found awareness, but the anthropologists also identified some barriers. For example, in one middle class neighborhood some people objected to putting clothes out to dry as it was seen as a marker of low status. In a lower income neighborhood, people were afraid that building "green" housing would ultimately lead to increases in housing prices and ultimately force them to move. Also, there was significant distrust of the city, including distrust of the climate action plan. The researchers suggested that the city build on existing concerns of the communities (such as interest in weatherization and retrofitting houses to make them more energy efficient). They also suggested that local organizations could become role models and demonstration sites. The good news is that the city government has implemented some of the suggestions.

### Business and Organizational Anthropology

More and more businesses and organizations have come to realize that anthropologists have useful knowledge to contribute. Anthropologists bring to the table grounding in thinking holistically—looking at the larger culture in which organizations are situated, the culture and subcultures of the organization, and the perspectives of different groups. And anthropologists understand the need to observe and listen first in an unstructured way. Doing ethnographic research is not just for understanding the businesses themselves and their *organizational cultures* but also to enable businesses to assess the needs of potential customers and users. Understanding cultures becomes even more important as trade becomes more global, international investments and joint ventures increase, and the multinational corporations spread their reach.

Business anthropologists often do not have the luxury of a year or more of study. Often they may only have a few days or weeks and have to make a "rapid assessment." To address this problem, teams of researchers often work together using observation, videos, interviewing, and analyses of social networks and documents (such as e-mails) to see if different types of data collected by different people lead to the same conclusion.30

Differences between people from different cultures can have profound effects on how people work together. Anthropologists know that communication is much more than the formal understanding of another language. People in some countries, such as the United States, expect explicit, straightforward verbal messages, but people in other countries are more indirect in their verbal messages.31 In Japan and China, for example, negative messages are less likely than messages expressing politeness and harmony. Many Eastern cultures have ways of saying no without saying the word. People in the United States emphasize the future, youth, informality, and competitiveness, but the emphases in other societies are often the opposite. In any business arrangement, perhaps no difference is as salient as the value a culture places on time. As we say, "Time is money."32 If a meeting is arranged and the other person is late, say, 45 minutes, people from the United States consider it rude, but such a delay is well within the range of acceptable behavior in many South American countries.

Businesses usually will ask for help in understanding their organizational culture when they perceive a problem. The culture of a business may interfere with the acceptance of new kinds of workers, mergers with other companies, or changing to meet new business needs. If the culture needs to be changed, it is first necessary to understand that culture and how and why it developed the way it did. Even something as seemingly minor as observing a parking lot and surrounding grounds is revealing. If there are many reserved spaces for executives and few amenities for workers, this may suggest a rigid hierarchy and less concern for employees.33 Of course, an anthropologist would need to verify this

25.5 Describe the field of business and organizational anthropology.

### **Applied Anthropology**

#### **General Motors: Creating a Better Business Culture**

fter World War II, General Motors (GM) was the largest corporation in the United States. But beginning in the 1960s imported cars from Germany and Japan began to seriously challenge GM's dominance. In addition, tastes were changing as consumers began opting for better fuel economy, cleaner emissions, and greater safety.

GM realized that it needed to change and in the 1980s began to explore new partnerships. They also hired an anthropologist, Elizabeth Briody, to conduct organizational research. In the mid-2000s, Briody led an expanded research team of six. In both time periods, the aim was the same. The researchers realized that in order to change, you first have to "see" what is going on. So, using ethnographic methods, the researchers undertook to understand the culture of the organization, including how work was organized, how people related to each other, and how people thought about their work and work conditions. They also asked how people of all statuses at GM how they wanted it to be—in other words, their ideal workplace culture.

Briody's observations of the mid-1980s suggested that the GM culture emphasized efficiency and meeting quotas. The emphasis was on the productivity of an individual, and rewards and blame were assigned to individuals. Departments tried to optimize their own productivity. Leadership was authoritarian. In short, there was little cooperation or collaboration, and there was more emphasis on quantity rather than quality. Interviews, though,

revealed that almost everyone, from top management on down, wanted a culture of collaboration, where everyone could contribute ideas, where teams took responsibility for solving problems, and where people were respectful of each other. Although most of the people interviewed wanted a different culture, the research team knew that culture change in organizations, just as in the broader society, is not easy to accomplish. So the researchers set out to design 10 "tools" designed to help individuals appreciate and learn collaboration techniques. Many of the exercises required smallgroup discussion, itself a collaborative enterprise. They even invented a video game to learn about the impact of different types of decision making

to solve a problem (one that actually occurred).

Did GM change? By many objective measures, GM improved substantially since the 1980s. Measures of quality increased, injuries and illnesses are down, and even productivity is 54 percent higher. The manufacturing culture has shifted to more sharing and team responsibilities. Jobs are now rotated so work injuries decline and people have more understanding of the wider process. With more responsibilities, workers are more empowered. All cultures change, but the process of change is aided by the will to do so and the willingness to undertake steps to learn how to make the process easier.

inference with information from other sources. (For a long-term project design to change a business culture, see the box "General Motors: Creating a Better Business Culture.")

Anthropologist Jill Kleinberg's research provides a case study on the challenges of having people from very different cultures work together successfully. Kleinberg studied six Japanese-owned firms in the United States.<sup>34</sup> All six firms employed both Japanese and Americans, although the Japanese dominated the managerial positions. The main goal of the study was to discover why there was considerable tension in the six firms. Kleinberg's first order of business was to interview people about their views of work and their jobs. She found clear differences between the Japanese and the American employees that seemed to reflect broader cultural differences. Americans wanted a clear definition of the job and its attached responsibilities, and they also wanted their job titles, authority, rights, and pay to match closely. The Japanese, on the other hand, emphasized the need to be flexible in their responsibilities as well as their tasks. They also felt that part of their responsibility was to help their co-workers. Americans were uncomfortable because the Japanese managers did not indicate exactly what the workers were supposed to do; even if there was a job description, the manager did not appear to pay attention to it. Americans were given little information, were left out of decision making, and were frustrated by the lack of opportunity to advance. The Japanese thought that the Americans were too hard to manage, too concerned with money and authority, and too concerned with their own interests.

Kleinberg recommended giving all employees more information about the company as well as conducting training sessions about cross-cultural differences in business cultures. She also recommended making the Japanese philosophy of management more explicit during the hiring process so that the company would be able to find Americans who were comfortable with their philosophy. But she also suggested that the managerial structure be somewhat "Americanized" so that American employees could feel at ease. Finally, she recommended that Americans be given more managerial positions and contact with their Japanese counterparts overseas. These suggestions might not eliminate all problems, but they would increase mutual understanding and trust.

Businesses and organizations also need help in developing and marketing products that people may want, and many have found that anthropologists are quite good at finding out because they go out and watch and ask questions. For example, Susan Squires watched families with young kids at breakfast to help a breakfast food company develop products. Parents tried to get kids to eat nutritious breakfasts, but kids typically didn't want to eat at 6:30 or 7 or only wanted a heavily sugared cereal. Some kids skipped breakfast and got hungry later in the morning and ended up eating their lunch early. Squires' observations led the company to develop a portable yoghurt in a tube called Go-Gurt.35

# Cultural Resource Management

Large-scale programs of planned change like those discussed earlier in this chapter have an impact not only on living people. They can also have an impact on the archaeological record left by the ancestors of living people. Recovering and preserving the archaeological record before programs of planned change disturb or destroy it is called **cultural resource management (CRM)**. CRM work is carried out by archaeologists who are often called contract archaeologists because they typically work under contract to a government agency, a private developer, or a native group.

What kinds of impact can programs of planned change have on the archaeological record? In the 1960s, a large number of hydroelectric dam projects were initiated to provide flood control and to bring a stable source of electrical power to developing nations. In Egypt, a dam was built on the Nile River at a site called Aswan. Archaeologists realized that once the dam was in place

a huge lake would form behind it, submerging thousands of archaeological sites, including the massive temple of Rameses II. Something needed to be done; the archaeological record had to be salvaged or protected. In the language of CRM, there needed to be a *mitigation plan* put into action. And there was. As the Aswan dam was being built, archaeologists went to work excavating sites that would be flooded. Archaeologists and engineers designed a way to take apart the temple of Rameses II and rebuild it, piece by piece, on higher ground where it would not be flooded. By the time the dam was completed in 1965, hundreds of sites had been investigated and two entire temple complexes moved.

Large-scale development projects are not the only projects that involve CRM archaeologists. In many nations, including the United States and Canada, historic preservation laws require any project receiving federal funds to ensure that archaeological resources are protected or their damage mitigated. Highway construction projects in the United States are common places to find CRM

archaeologists at work. Virtually all highway projects rely on federal funding, and before a highway can be built, a complete archaeological survey of the proposed right-of-way has to be made. If archaeological sites are found, potential damage to them must be mitigated. A CRM archaeologist will work with the construction company, the state archaeologist, and perhaps a federal archaeologist to decide on the best course of action. In some cases, the archaeological site will be excavated. In others, the right-of-way may be moved. In still others, the decision is to allow the archaeological site to be destroyed because it would be too costly to excavate or the site may not be significant enough to warrant excavation. Regardless of the decision, the CRM archaeologist plays a crucial role in assessing and protecting the archaeological record.

CRM archaeologists do not work only for state or federal agencies. In many nations today, CRM archaeologists are also working with native peoples to protect, preserve, and manage archaeological materials for them. Indeed, archaeologist John Ravesloot recently stated that "the future of American archaeology is with Indian communities functioning as active, not passive, participants in the interpretation, management, and preservation of their rich cultural heritage."36 One example of such a working relationship is the Zuni Heritage and Historic Preservation Office. During the 1970s, the Pueblo of Zuni decided it needed to train tribal members in archaeology to ensure that Zuni cultural resources and properties were managed properly. It hired three professional archaeologists and, with additional assistance from the National Park Service and the Arizona State Museum, initiated a program to train and employ tribal members in cultural resource management. Working with these non-Zuni archaeologists, the Pueblo of Zuni were able to establish their own historic preservation office that today manages and coordinates all historic preservation on the Zuni reservation, a task that the federal government managed until 1992. The Pueblo also established the Zuni Cultural Resource Enterprise, a Zuni-owned CRM business that employs both Zuni and non-Zuni archaeologists and carries out contract archaeology projects both on and off the Zuni reservation.37

In addition to working with native peoples, CRM archaeologists are also working with the public through was has come to be known as public archaeology. One of the basic ideas behind public archaeology is that because most CRM archaeology is done with public money, it is important for the public to benefit from the results of archaeological research. Unfortunately, that is not always the case, and today popular media is far more likely to discuss archaeology in the context of ancient alien contact or Biblical fundamentalism than the context of mainstream anthropology. Working directly with the public, for example by having "open houses" at archaeological sites or hosting artifact identification days, is one way that CRM archaeologists can help to overcome popular misconceptions of the past as well as learn more about the past.38

Equally important is for archaeologists to undertake work that is meaningful to local communities, and this too is part of public archaeology. For example, CRM archaeologists in Hawaii are starting to work directly with Native Hawaiian communities to provide information on ancestral practices, and in turn Native Hawaiian communities are helping CRM archaeologists to identify and preserve important archaeological sites. As explained by Hawaiian archaeologists Sean Nãleimaile and Lokelani Brant, by incorporating Native Hawaiian "cultural practices and resource management systems into existing frameworks of CRM, we will reestablish successful strategies to maintain our resources. More importantly, these foundations work to reestablish these cultural practices in the now."39 Public archaeologists believe that engaging the interests and needs of local communities, as is happening in Hawaii, serves to improve both the CRM work and the local community.

Cultural resource management accounts for the majority of archaeology jobs in the United States.40 As development and construction projects continue to affect the archaeological record, the need for well-trained CRM archaeologists is likely to persist.

25.7 Describe the field of museum anthropology.

## Museum Anthropology

Museums have been an important part of anthropology since the very beginnings of the field. As early anthropologists returned from archaeological excavations and ethnographic explorations, they brought with them artifacts from the peoples and cultures they encountered. These materials were collected in museums—often natural history museums since, at the time (the mid to late 19th century), non-Western artifacts were not considered art, nor were the cultures of non-Western peoples considered part of history. Thus the objects non-Western peoples produced and the information about their cultures were deposited with similar items from other forms of animal life. Today we recognize this as an ethnocentric, perhaps even racist, view of non-Western people, but many anthropological and archaeological collections are still deposited and maintained in natural history museums. Many other museums exist today as well, from cultural museums to historic site museums to museums showcasing traditional works of art, and anthropologists work in all of these.

Anthropologists typically hold one of three positions in museums: curators, collection managers, or educators. Curators are responsible for the overall content and use of collections. They oversee the museum collections with an eye to their value for research and their importance to the history of their field. In some cases curators acquire (or accession) materials in order to fill areas that are inadequately represented in their collections; in other cases they have to make difficult decisions about discarding (or de-accessioning) materials that are no longer of use. Curators also lead teams that evaluate and develop the museum's exhibits. Collection managers work to ensure that the museum's collections are preserved. They make sure that storage facilities and records are properly maintained, and they regularly check the collections to make sure they are not deteriorating. When deterioration is found, collections managers work with conservators to repair damage and determine ways to keep further damage from occurring. Finally, museum educators work with the public to teach them about the peoples and cultures represented in the museum's collections.41

Regardless of their position, public education is a central role for all museum anthropologists. A good example can be seen in recent work involving a traditional native New Zealand Maori meeting house, or *marae,* on display at the Field Museum in Chicago. A *marae* is used in Maori culture as a place where individuals are allowed to air grievances and settle disputes in an atmosphere of respect and open-mindedness. Field Museum curator of Pacific anthropology John Terrell wished that Chicago had such a space and then realized that the *marae* itself might be used as one; in other words, that the Maori *marae* might become a Chicago *marae*. Terrell worked with a group of Maori and a group of teachers from Chicago public schools to explore this idea, and today the *marae* is used by groups seeking to discuss difficult issues in a context of mutual respect. 42 In this way Terrell was able to not only display an important cultural object but also, with the assistance of the collections manager and museum education staff, develop a way for the object to be used by the Chicago community in a manner similar to its use within Maori culture.

25.8 Describe the field of forensic anthropology.

#### **Forensic anthropology** The application of anthropology, usually physical an-

thropology, to help identify human remains and assist in solving crimes.

## Forensic Anthropology

Many of us are fascinated by detective stories. We are interested in crimes and why they occur, and we like to read about them, fictional or not. **Forensic anthropology** is the specialty in anthropology that is devoted to helping solve crimes and identifying human remains, usually by applying knowledge of physical anthropology.43 It is attracting increasing attention by the public and an increasing number of practitioners. One forensic anthropologist says she is called "the bone lady" by law enforcement personnel.44 Like others in her line of work, she is asked to dig up or examine human bones to help solve crimes. Narrowing down identification is one of the first priorities, but it is not as simple as on television shows. Are these the bones of a man or woman? How old was the person? How well the forensic anthropologist can answer these seemingly simple questions depends upon whether the remains include most bones of the skeleton. Identification of an adult's sex from remains is easier if the pelvis is present, but establishing sex in nonadult remains is not reliable from skeletal remains.45 With regard to estimating age, only a wide age range can be estimated for adults, but a much narrower range can be estimated for nonadult remains. Forensic anthropologists are often asked for "race" as well. As we discussed in earlier chapters, "race" is not a useful biological category when applied to humans, but it is a significant social category. Forensic anthropologists can estimate with fairly high accuracy whether a person's ancestors came from Asia, Europe, or Africa, but they cannot detect skin color.46 The police files may suggest that an adult male with Asian ancestry disappeared five years ago. The forensic anthropologist could say with a high probability that the remains were of an Asian male adult. Dental, surgical, or hospital records from that individual might lead to unique features that could be matched for more precise identification. Sometimes the forensic anthropologist can suggest the cause of death when the law enforcement people are stumped.

Another important piece of evidence that is often provided by forensic anthropologists is the time of death. Establishing when a victim died can be essential to solving a crime. Forensic anthropologists use changes in the body as it decays to estimate how long an individual has been dead. In the short term, one to three days after death, the body decays primarily through the action of digestive enzymes and bacteria already in the body. Forensic anthropologists use indicators such as body temperature (which decreases about one degree an hour after death), skin discoloration, or the build-up of lactic acid in the muscles (which causes them to progres-

sively stiffen over the 12 hours after death) to determine time of death. Over the longer term, three days to a month after death, the action of factors outside the body contribute significantly to decay. The most important of these factors is the activity of insects. Blow flies, for example, deposit eggs on dead tissue during specific periods after death. The eggs then hatch into maggots, again during a specific period of time, and the maggots slowly grow into adults. By carefully examining the presence and maturity of the eggs and maggots of various species of flies, the forensic anthropologist can provide a good estimate of the time of death.47

Some cultural anthropologists have also done forensic work, often in connection with legal cases involving Native Americans. For example, in 1978, Barbara Joans was asked to advise the defense in a trial of six older Bannock-Shoshoni women from the Fort Hall reservation who were accused of fraud. They had received "supplemental security income (SSI)," which the social service agency claimed they had no right to receive because they had not reported receiving rent money on land that they owned. Joans presented evidence that the women, although they spoke some English, did not have enough proficiency to understand the nuances of what the SSI people told them. The judge agreed with the defense and ruled that the SSI would have to use a Bannock-Shoshoni interpreter in the future when they went to the reservation to describe the requirements of the program.48

In recent years, Clyde Snow and other forensic anthropologists have been called on to confirm horrendous abuses of human rights. Governments have been responsible for the systematic killing of their citizens, and forensic anthropologists have helped to bring the perpetrators to justice. For example, Snow and other forensic anthropologists helped to confirm that the military

dictatorship in Argentina in the 1980s was responsible for the deaths of many Argentine civilians who had "disappeared." The forensic anthropologists were also able to determine the location of mass graves and the identity of victims of state-organized brutality in Guatemala. In addition to bringing the perpetrators to justice, confirming the massacres and identifying the victims help the families of the "disappeared" put their anguish behind them. A special session (called "Uncovering the 'Disappeared': Clyde Snow and Forensic Anthropologists Work for Justice"49) at the annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association in November 2000 honored Snow and other forensic anthropologists.

# Summary and Review

#### Ethics of Applied Anthropology

25.1 Discuss the ethical code of applied anthropology and discuss the ethical issues faced by practicing anthropologists.

- • Applied anthropology researches how a condition might be treated, whether or not it would actually be an improvement, and whether it is actually a change that is wanted by the people affected.
- • Anthropology as a profession has adopted ethical codes of responsibility, above all a responsibility to ensure the welfare and dignity of those who are being studied and a responsibility to report openly and truthfully to those who will read about their research.
- • Even with a code of ethics, complicated ethical issues arise for anthropologists in connection with development projects as well as for physical anthropologists and archaeologists.

What are some examples of ethical issues and dilemmas facing those practicing applied anthropology?

#### Evaluating the Effects of Planned Change

25.2 Discuss the need to evaluate the effects of planned change.

- • Even if a program of planned change has beneficial consequences in the short run, a great deal of thought and investigation has to be given to its long-term effects, which could eventually produce negative results.
- • Applied anthropologists have played an important role in pointing out the problems with development programs that fail to evaluate long-term consequences. Governments and other agencies are beginning to ask for anthropological help in the planning stages of projects.

![](_page_14_Picture_14.jpeg)

What factors may be important in bringing about successful change?

#### Difficulties in Instituting Planned Change

25.3 Identify and give examples of some difficulties in implementing planned change.

- • Whether a program of planned change can be successfully implemented depends largely on whether the people want the proposed change and like the proposed program. Lack of awareness can be a temporary barrier to solving the problem at hand.
- • A growing trend is for anthropologists to become advocates for affected communities, involving the people affected in all phases of the project, from participating in the research design to execution and publishing.
- • Applied anthropologists are increasingly asked to work on behalf of indigenous grassroots organizations. Grassroots organizations can succeed with development projects where government or outside projects fail.
- • Anthropologists are also collaborating more with people from other disciplines.

In what way are anthropologists mediators between affected communities and those initiating change? Give an example.

#### Environmental Anthropology

25.4 Describe the field of environmental anthropology.

• Environmental anthropology focuses on issues relating to the interaction of humans with their environments at the local, regional, and global levels, particularly focusing on how to understand and alleviate the degradation of the environment.

• There is increasing recognition that imposing environmental policies from the top down does not work very well and that efforts are more likely to succeed if the affected communities participate in the planning of programs.

What kinds of questions do environmental anthropologists ask?

#### Business and Organizational Anthropology

25.5 Describe the field of business and organizational anthropology.

- • Anthropologists can help businesses understand other cultures, which is becoming an even more important aspect as trade becomes more global, international investments and joint ventures increase, and the multinational corporations spread their reach.
- • Within a business, anthropologists can help business members understand their own organizational culture, especially when it may interfere with the acceptance of new kinds of workers, mergers with other companies, or changing to meet new business needs.
- • Businesses and organizations also need help in developing and marketing products that people may want, and anthropologists are quite good at finding out because they observe and ask questions.

What issues related to globalization affect the work of business and organizational anthropologists?

### Cultural Resource Management

25.6 Describe the field of cultural resource management.

- • Cultural resource management involves recovering and preserving the archaeological record before programs of planned change disturb or destroy it.
- • Another focus of cultural resource management is public archaeology, educating the public about the past.

![](_page_15_Picture_13.jpeg)

Why is it important for cultural resource management anthropologists to educate the public?

### Museum Anthropology

25.7 Describe the field of museum anthropology.

- • An early practice, which still occurs, was to archive artifacts from non-Western societies in museums of natural history. More and more today, other types of museums are providing less biased views of non-Western cultures.
- • Public education is a central role for all museum anthropologists.

![](_page_15_Figure_19.jpeg)

How have practices in museum anthropology changed in the past several decades? Give an example.

### Forensic Anthropology

- 25.8 Describe the field of forensic anthropology.
- • Forensic anthropology is devoted to helping solve crimes and identifying human remains, usually by applying knowledge of physical anthropology.
- • A relatively new area of forensic anthropology is work to confirm abuses of human rights, especially in terms of systematic killings of citizens.

# Think on it

- 1. What particular advantages do anthropologists have in trying to solve practical problems?
- 2. What disadvantages do anthropologists have in trying to solve practical problems?
- 3. Is it ethical to try to influence people's lives when they have not asked for help or if they don't want the change? Explain your answer.
