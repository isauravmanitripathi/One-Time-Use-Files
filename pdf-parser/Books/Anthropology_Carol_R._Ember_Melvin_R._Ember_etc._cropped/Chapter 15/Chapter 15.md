### Learning Objectives

15.1 Describe foraging and complex foraging, and identify the general societal features associated with food collecting.

15.2 Describe the various forms of food production (horticulture, intensive agriculture, and pastoralism), and identify the general societal features associated with each.

15.3 Identify environmental restraints on food-getting.

15.4 Discuss the origin of food production.

15.5 Describe and critically discuss the spread and intensification of food production.

The way we get our food has changed dramatically over the course of human history. Today almost half of the world's people live in cities, and food is obtained by buying it. Where and when we buy food may be culturally determined; Europeans and Asians, for example, are more likely to prefer going to a market daily to buy fresh food. North Americans have accustomed themselves to going to a supermarket, where they get a stockpile of food for the week. Those of us who buy our food from a supermarket can buy a week's worth of food within an hour, refrigerate it, and move on to other activities. Seasons don't daunt us. Week after week, we know food will be there. But we do not think of what would happen if the food were not delivered to the supermarket. We wouldn't be able to eat, and without eating for a while, we would die. Despite the old adage "Man [or woman] does not live by bread alone," we could not live at all without bread or the equivalent. Food-getting activities, then, take precedence over other activities important to survival. Reproduction, social control (the maintenance of peace and order within a group), defense against external threat, and the transmission of knowledge and skills to future generations—none could take place without energy derived from food. But it is not merely energy that is required for survival and long-term reproduction. Food-getting strategies need to provide the appropriate combination of nutrients throughout varying seasons and changing environmental conditions. Food-getting activities are also important because the way a society gets its food strongly predicts other aspects of a culture, from community size and permanence of settlement to the type of economy and its degree of inequality, the type of political system, and even art styles and religious beliefs and practices.

In contrast with our own and similar societies, there are still many societies in which almost all able-bodied adults are directly engaged in getting food for themselves and their families. Such economies are described as subsistence economies. For millions of years, humans obtained their food by gathering wild plants, hunting or scavenging wild animals, and fishing; agriculture was unknown. Agriculture is a relatively recent phenomenon, dating back only about 10,000 years. And industrial or mechanized agriculture is hardly more than a century old. Harvesting machines have been used a little bit longer, but self-propelled machines had to wait for the internal combustion engine and the rise of the oil industry.

In this chapter, we look at the ways different societies get food and discuss some of the features associated with the different patterns. We ask why societies vary in their foodgetting strategies. We shall see that the physical environment by itself has only a limited or restraining effect on how a society gets most of its food. To explain the variation more fully, we discuss at the end of the chapter why societies in the prehistoric past switched from collecting wild food resources to cultivating plants and raising animals.

# Foraging

**Foraging** or *food collection* may generally be defined as a strategy whereby humans gather, hunt, scavenge, or fish to obtain their food from plants and animals found in the wild. Although foraging was the way humans got their food for most of human history, foragers—also commonly referred to as **hunter-gatherers**—are not very numerous in the world today. Most foraging societies currently live in what have been called the *marginal areas* of the earth—deserts, the Arctic, and dense tropical forests—habitats that do not allow easy exploitation by modern agricultural technologies. In the last few hundred years, only about 5 million people have been foragers.<sup>1</sup>

Yet the relatively few foraging societies still available for observation have been the focus of intense anthropological study. Of course, our knowledge of human culture depends on an understanding of all its variations, from foragers to intensive agriculturalists to postindustrial cultures. But why is there so much focus on hunter-gatherers when there are so few societies left and foraging as a way of life for the world's humanity is mostly in the past? The main reason has been a belief in the significance of the hunter-gatherer way of life in the evolution of human culture. Anthropologists have argued that if we want to understand Subsistence economies Economies in which almost all able-bodied adults are largely engaged in getting food for themselves and their families.

#### Foraging May be

generally defined as a food-getting strategy that obtains wild plant and animal resources through gathering, hunting, scavenging, or fishing; also known as food collection.

15.1 Describe foraging and complex foraging, and identify the general societal features associated with food collecting.

#### Hunter-gatherers

People who collect food from naturally occurring resources, that is, wild plants, animals, and fish. The term hunter-gatherers minimizes sometimes heavy dependence on fishing. Also referred to as foragers or food collectors.

Like the Ngatatjara, the Aborigine of Australia's Northern Territory are also foragers. This woman is digging for a major source of protein for her family, witchetty grubs, the large moth larvae that are found under the so-called witchetty bush.

many aspects of culture, we cannot disregard cultures whose primary subsistence strategy characterized most of human history. Some even surmise that much of human behavior is shaped by that long stretch of history when humans were foragers. We must nevertheless be cautious in drawing inferences about the past from our observations of recent and contemporary foragers. First, early foragers lived in almost all types of environments, including some bountiful ones. Therefore, what we observe of recent and contemporary foragers, who generally live in deserts, the Arctic, and tropical forests, may not be comparable to what the forager way of life might have been in more favorable past environments.2 Second, contemporary foragers are not relics of the past. Like all contemporary societies, they have evolved and are still evolving. Indeed, recent research reveals considerable variation in economic behavior, as well as in social structure, among foraging groups that share common ancestry, which suggests that recent foragers have responded to differences in local environmental conditions.3 Third, recent and contemporary foragers have been interacting with kinds of societies that did not

exist until after 10,000 years ago—agriculturalists, pastoralists, and intrusive, powerful state societies.4 Evidence from South Asia and Southeast Asia, for example, suggests that trade with agriculturalists was probably an important component of foragers' economic strategies for millennia.5 And, in the recent past, foraging people have increasingly depended not only on trade but also on agriculture and commercial activities as additional means of subsistence.

Long before the English began to colonize Australia in 1788 (by sending shiploads of convicts to establish settlements), that vast continent was home to several hundred ancient societies that spoke many languages and lived in a variety of environments but had in common the foraging way of life. One of these aboriginal societies, the Ngatatjara, still lived by gathering wild plants and hunting wild animals in the Gibson Desert of western Australia as late as 1967, when Richard Gould's 15-month visit among them was coming to an end. The description of daily life among the Ngatatjara that follows is based on Gould's observations.6 (Because it is customary in ethnographic writing, we adopt the present tense in the narrative, but readers should remember that we are referring to the society's life in the 1960s.)

The desert environment of the Ngatatjara averages less than 8 inches of rain per year, and the temperature in summer may rise to 118°F. The few permanent water holes are separated by hundreds of square miles of sand, scrub, and rock. Even before Europeans arrived in Australia, the area was sparsely populated, with less than one person per 35 to 40 square miles. Now there are even fewer people because the aboriginal population was decimated by introduced diseases and colonial mistreatment.

The Ngatatjara, like most Australian aborigines, are traditionally nomadic and move their campsites often in search of food. Each campsite is isolated and inhabited by only a small number of people, or by clusters of groups including as many as 80 people. Camp is never set up right next to a watering spot, which is the natural destination of the game the men hope to capture. If the camp is too close, the noise might frighten away the animals. The Ngatatjara are also careful not to encroach on the needs of neighboring bands (some of which may be in-laws) by seeming to take over the scarce watering spots.

On a typical day, the camp begins to stir just before sunrise, while it is still dark. Children are sent to fetch water, and the people breakfast on water and food left over from the night before. In the cool of early morning, the adults talk and make plans for the day. Where should they go for food—to places they have been recently or a new place? Sometimes there are other considerations. One woman, for instance, may want to look for plants that have the kind of bark she uses to make new sandals. The conversation can go on for a while, since the group prefers that everyone is in agreement about what to do.

Once the women decide which plants they want to gather and where they think those plants are most likely to be found, they take up their digging sticks and set out with large wooden bowls of drinking water balanced on their heads. Their children ride on their hips or walk alongside them. Meanwhile, the men may have decided to hunt emus, 6-foot-tall ostrichlike birds that do not fly. The men go to a creek bed where they will wait to ambush any game that may come along. They lie patiently behind a screen of brush they have set up, hoping for a chance to throw a spear at an emu or even a kangaroo. They can throw only once because the game will run away if they miss.

By noon, all have returned to camp, the women each with their wooden bowls filled with up to 15 pounds of fruit or other plant foods and perhaps some lizards, the men more often than not with only some small game, such as rabbits. Because the men often return from the hunt empty-handed, the daily cooked meal is likely to be mostly plant food. The women will prepare the meal, and it will be eaten toward evening, after the group has spent an afternoon resting, gossiping, and making or repairing tools.

Life has changed dramatically for Australian aborigines since the late 1960s. Today, many live in small, settled villages. Anthropologist Victoria Burbank describes one such village in the Northern Territory of Australia where she did fieldwork in the 1980s. The once-nomadic aborigines live in a village that Burbank calls "Mangrove." The village, founded around a Protestant mission in the 1950s, is home to a population of 600 who live in houses with stoves, refrigerators, toilets, washing machines, and even television sets. Their children attend school full-time, and there is a health clinic for their medical needs. They still forage occasionally, but most of their food comes from the store. Some earn wages; many more subsist on government welfare checks.7

### The Inupiaq of the North American Arctic

The diet of the Australian aborigines has been mainly wild plant foods. The foraging Inupiaq peoples, on the other hand, live year-round in the North American Arctic, where plants are too scarce to be an important part of the diet. From Greenland and Labrador in the east to Alaska in the west, the indigenous Arctic peoples have depended almost entirely on sea and land mammals and fish. (The term *Eskimo* is used widely in the West, but it is not a word in any of the native languages in that area. Many of the native Arctic groups, particularly those now living in Canada, prefer to be named Inuit.) We focus here on the traditional life of the north Alaskan Inupiaq in the beginning of the 19th century, as reconstructed by Ernest Burch (the "ethnographic present" in the following discussion).8 Northern Alaska is relatively "warm" for its latitude but not for most of us farther south; little sun and below-zero temperatures for a month or so in the winter are hardly warm. Rivers and lakes freeze in October and do not thaw until May. Even the ocean freezes for part of the winter.

What the Inupiaq get for food depends mostly on the season, but the critical resources are sea mammals (ranging in size from whales to seals), fish, and caribou or wild reindeer. The usual technique for hunting sea mammals is to hurl a toggle harpoon into the animal from a kayak. Because it is very difficult to kill a moving sea mammal, hunters attach a line to the animal with the harpoon; on the other end of the line is a sealskin float that indicates where the harpooned sea mammal can be located. The sea mammal gets more and more tired pulling the float until the hunter is able to kill it with a lance. One man alone can manage to hunt smaller sea mammals, but groups of men are needed to hunt whales. In the winter, when the sea ice is frozen, hunters use a different hunting technique. Hunters must locate a breathing hole and then wait, immobile and attentive, for hours or sometimes days until a seal comes up for air. The instant a seal surfaces, the hunters must aim perfectly with the harpoon.

The women butcher the animal, prepare it for eating or storage, and process the skin. Women sew all of the skin clothing. They also hunt small animals, such as hares, and do much of the fishing. Various techniques are used for fishing—hook and line, spearing, and ambushing with nets and dams. Women make the fishing nets, and it takes the better part of a year to make one. Although there are not many plants to gather, the women do that too.

Related families usually live together and move camp by boat or sled to be in the best place to intercept the migratory animals and fish. For instance, caribou migrate, so the Inupiaq try to catch them by building a corral in a place through which they are expected to pass. A network of interrelated families lives and moves in a territory of thousands of square miles, moving outside it only when they have made arrangements with other groups to do so.

Much has changed since the time just described. Now the Inupiaq live in villages or towns with many modern conveniences. In the village of Kivalina, there are permanent houses with electricity, telephones, and television sets. Dog teams have been replaced by all-terrain vehicles and snowmobiles. There are powerful outboard motors rather than skin boats. Many men and women have full-time, wage-paying jobs. But even though the people may buy most of their food, there is still a preference for traditional foods, so the Inupiaq still hunt and fish on the weekends.

### General Features of Foragers

Despite the differences in terrain and climate under which they live and the different foodcollecting technologies they use, Australian aborigines, indigenous Arctic peoples, and most other recent foragers have certain characteristic cultural patterns (see Table 15.1). Most live in small communities in sparsely populated territories and follow a nomadic lifestyle, forming no permanent settlements. As a rule, they do not recognize individuals' land rights. Their communities generally do not have different classes of people and tend to have no specialized or full-time political officials.9 Division of labor in foraging societies is based largely on age and gender: Men exclusively hunt large marine and land animals and usually do most of the fishing, and women usually gather wild plant foods.10 Foragers must decide what plants or animals to target. Optimal foraging theory, which we discuss in the next chapter, helps explain some of the decisions foragers make.

Is there a typical pattern of food-getting among foragers? Many anthropologists have assumed that foragers typically get their food more from gathering than from hunting, and that women contribute more than men to subsistence because women generally do the gathering.11 Although gathering is the most important food-getting activity for some foragers (e.g., the Ngatatjara aborigines and the !Kung of southern Africa), this is not true for most food-collecting societies known to us. A survey of foraging societies indicates that there is a lot of variation with regard to which food-getting activity is most important to the society. However, gathering and hunting each typically contribute about 26–35 percent; but fishing is typically more important.12 That is why we prefer the term *foragers* rather than

#### Table 15.1 Variation in Food-Getting and Associated Features

the often-used *hunter-gatherers*; the term *foragers* allows us to recognize the importance of fishing. In any case, because men generally do the fishing as well as the hunting, the men usually contribute more to food-getting than do the women among recent foragers.13

Because foragers move their camps often and walk great distances, it may seem that the food-collecting way of life is difficult. Although we do not have enough quantitative studies to tell us what is typical of most foragers, studies of two Australian aborigine groups<sup>14</sup> and of one !Kung group15 indicate that those foragers do not spend many hours getting food. For example, !Kung adults spend an average of about 17 hours per week collecting food. Even when you add the time spent making tools (about 6 hours a week) and doing housework (about 19 hours a week), the !Kung seem to have more leisure time than many agriculturalists, as we discuss later.

### Complex Foragers

When we say that foragers tend to have certain traits, this does not mean that all of them have those traits. There is considerable variability among societies that depend on foraging. Foraging societies that depend heavily on fishing (such as on the Pacific Coast of the northwestern United States and Canada or on the south coast of New Guinea) are more likely to have bigger and more permanent communities and more social inequality than foraging societies elsewhere that depend mostly on game and plants.16 The Pacific Coast and New Guinea coastal people also tend to have higher population densities, food storage,17 occupational specialization, resource ownership, slavery, and competitiveness.18 Two foraging groups that have depended heavily on annual salmon runs, the Tlingit of southeastern Alaska and the Nimpkish of British Columbia, have had a three-tiered status system of high status, commoners, and slaves. The high-status individuals were obliged to stage elaborate, competitive feasts and ritually distribute valuables.19 The social inequality and competitiveness in these cultures differs greatly from what we find in typical foragers, who generally show little social differentiation. In a worldwide study of foragers, there also tended to be more intercommunity fighting in those societies that were more dependent on fishing. Perhaps conflict arose because some fishing sites were more predictable than others, leading people to fight to defend them.<sup>20</sup>

In New Guinea, about 40 societies depend almost exclusively on foraging. Wild sago provides most of the carbohydrates for these foragers, but they vary considerably on how they obtain animal protein. Paul Roscoe has found that the amount of dependence upon fishing is strongly associated with density of population and settlement size. For example, societies with more than 75 percent dependence upon fishing have average community sizes of about 350 people, as compared with community size of about 50 for those with less than 25 percent dependence upon fishing. Some villages were much larger. One Asmat village had over 1,400 people, and a Waropen village over 1,700.

# Food Production

Beginning about 10,000 years ago, certain peoples in widely separated geographic locations made the revolutionary changeover to **food production**. That is, they began to domesticate plants and animals. (Domesticated plants and animals are different from the ancestral wild forms.) With the domestication of these food sources, people acquired control over certain natural processes, such as animal breeding and plant seeding. Today, most peoples in the world depend for their food on some combination of domesticated plants and animals.

Anthropologists generally distinguish three major types of food production systems *horticulture*, *intensive agriculture*, and *pastoralism*.

### Horticulture

The word **horticulture** may conjure up visions of people with "green thumbs" growing orchids and other flowers in greenhouses. But to anthropologists, the word means the growing of crops of all kinds with relatively simple tools and methods, in the absence of permanently

**Food production** The form of subsistence technology in which foodgetting is dependent on the cultivation and domestication of plants and animals.

**Horticulture** Plant cultivation carried out with relatively simple tools and methods; nature is allowed to replace nutrients in the soil, in the absence of permanently cultivated fields.

15.2 Describe the various forms of food production (horticulture, intensive agriculture, and pastoralism), and identify the general societal features associated with each.

#### **Extensive (shifting)**

**cultivation** A type of horticulture in which the land is worked for short periods and then left to regenerate for some years before being used again. Also called shifting cultivation.

**Slash-and-burn** A form of shifting cultivation in which the natural vegetation is cut down and burned off. The cleared ground is used for a short time and then left to regenerate.

cultivated fields. The tools are usually hand tools, such as the digging stick or hoe, not plows or other equipment pulled by animals or tractors. And the methods used do not include fertilization, irrigation, or other ways to restore soil fertility after a growing season.

There are two kinds of horticulture. The more common one involves a dependence on **extensive (shifting) cultivation**. The land is worked for short periods and then left idle for some years. During the years when the land is not cultivated, wild plants and brush grow; when the fields are later cleared by *slash-and-burn techniques,* nutrients are returned to the soil. The other kind of horticulture involves a dependence on long-growing tree crops. The two kinds of horticulture may be practiced in the same society, but in neither case is there permanent cultivation of field crops.

Most horticultural societies do not rely on crops alone for food. Many also hunt or fish; a few are nomadic for part of the year. For example, the Kayapo of the Brazilian Amazon leave their villages for as long as three months at a time to trek through the forest in search of game. The entire village participates in a trek, carrying large quantities of garden produce and moving their camp every day.21 Other horticulturalists raise domestic animals, but these are usually not large animals, such as cattle and camels.22 More often than not, horticulturalists raise smaller animals, such as pigs, chickens, goats, and sheep.

Let us look now at two horticultural societies, the Yanomamö of the Brazilian-Venezuelan Amazon and the Samoans of the South Pacific.

The Yanomamö Dense tropical forest covers most of Yanomamö territory. From the air, the typical village is located in a forest clearing and looks like a single, large, circular lean-to with its inner side open to the central plaza. Each individual family has its own portion of the lean-to under the common roof. Each family's portion of the lean-to has a back wall (part of the closed back wall around the circular village structure), but the portions are open on the sides to each other as well as onto the central plaza of the village. The Yanomamö get most of their calories from garden produce, but according to Raymond Hames,

the Yanomamö actually spend most of their time foraging.23

Before the people can plant, the forest must be cleared of trees and brush. Like most shifting cultivators, the Yanomamö use a combination of techniques: slashing the undergrowth, felling trees, and using controlled burning to clear a garden spot in other words, **slash-and-burn** horticulture. Before the 1950s, the Yanomamö had only stone axes, so felling trees was quite difficult. Now they have steel machetes and axes given or traded to them by missionaries.

Because of the work involved in clearing a garden, the Yanomamö prefer to make use of forest patches that have little thorny brush and not too many large trees.24 After the ground is cleared, the Yanomamö plant plantains, manioc, sweet potatoes, taro, and a variety of plants for medicine, condiments, and craft materials. Men do the heavy clearing work to prepare a garden, and they as well as women plant the crops. Women usually go to the gardens daily to weed and harvest. After two or three years, the yields diminish and the forest starts growing back, making continued cultivation less desirable and more difficult, so they abandon the garden and clear a new one. If they can, they clear adjacent forest, but if gardens are far from the village, they will move the village to a new location. Villages are moved about every five years because of gardening needs and warfare. There is a great deal of intervillage raiding, so villages are often forced to flee to another location.

Extensive cultivation requires a lot of territory because new gardens are not cleared until the forest grows back. What is often misunderstood is why it is so important to shift gardens. Not only is a burned field easier to plant, but the organic matter that is burned provides necessary nutrients for a good yield. If horticulturalists come back too quickly to a spot with little plant cover, a garden made there will not produce a satisfactory yield.

The Yanomamö crops do not provide much protein, so hunting and fishing are important to their diet. Men hunt birds, peccaries, monkeys, and tapir with bows and arrows. Women, men, and children enjoy fishing. They catch fish by hand, with small bows and arrows, and by stream poisoning. Everybody gathers honey, hearts of palm, Brazil nuts, and cashews, although the men usually climb trees to shake down the nuts. Much of the foraging is done from the village base, but the Yanomamö, like the Kayapo, may go on treks to forage from time to time.

The Samoans The Samoans numbered about 56,000 people in 1839, soon after European missionaries arrived.25 The islands of Samoa, which are about 2,300 miles south of the Hawaiian Islands, are volcanic in origin, with central ridges and peaks as high as 6,000 feet. Though the land is generally steep, the islands have a lush plant cover watered by up to 200 inches of rain a year (about five times the amount of rain that falls on New York City in a year). All that rain does not interfere much with outdoor activity because the torrential showers do not last long and the water disappears quickly into the porous volcanic soil. The temperature is relatively constant, rarely falling below 70°F or rising above 88°F. Strong cooling trade winds blow most of the year, generally from the east or southeast, and on the coasts one hears a continuous low rumble from the huge Pacific swells that break upon the fringing coral reefs offshore.

Samoan horticulture involves mostly three tree crops requiring little work except in harvesting. Once planted, and with hardly more than a few years of waiting, the breadfruit tree continues to produce about two crops a year for up to a half century. Coconut trees may continue to produce for a hundred years. And banana trees make new stalks of fruit, each weighing more than 50 pounds, for many years; merely cutting down one stalk induces the plant to grow another. Young men do most of the harvesting of tree crops. Women do the occasional weeding.

The Samoans also practice some shifting cultivation; men periodically clear small patches of land for taro, a root crop that is a staple food. The taro patches can produce a few crops before they must be allowed to revert to bush so that soil fertility can be restored. But even taro cultivation does not require much work; planting requires nothing more than slightly burying the top sliced off a root just harvested. Young men do most of the planting and harvesting. The taro patches are weeded infrequently, mostly by women. This kind of casual farming behavior prompted Captain Bligh, of *Mutiny on the Bounty* fame, to describe the Tahitians as lazy.26 Captain Bligh's attitude was ethnocentric. South Pacific islanders such as the Samoans and Tahitians cannot weed as often as European farmers without risking the erosion of their soil because, in contrast with European farmlands, which are generally flat or only slightly sloping, the land of Samoa and Tahiti is mostly steep. The Samoan and Tahitian practice of not weeding crops and growing them in glorious and messy confusion minimizes soil erosion; the deep and shallow root structures of the various plants growing together prevent the loose volcanic soil from being washed away by the torrential showers.

The Samoans keep chickens and pigs, which they eat only occasionally. The major source of animal protein in the Samoan diet is fish, caught inside and outside the reef. Younger men may swim in the deep sea outside the reef and use a sling to spear fish; older men are more likely to stand on the reef and throw a four-pointed spear at fish swimming inside the reef. For many years, people in the villages of Samoa have sold copra, the sundried meat of the ripe coconut, to the world market for coconut oil. Men generally cut the copra from the shells after the ripe coconuts fall by themselves to the ground. With the cash earned from the sale of copra, people buy imported items such as machetes, kerosene, and flour. People in most villages still produce most of the foods they eat, but many have migrated to towns on the bigger islands and to cities in Hawaii and on the U.S. mainland to find wage-paying jobs.

General Features of Horticulturalists In most horticultural societies, simple farming techniques have tended to yield more food from a given area than is generally available to foragers. Consequently, horticulture is able to support larger, more densely populated

communities. The way of life of horticulturalists is more sedentary than that of foragers, although communities may move after some years to farm a new series of plots. (Some horticulturalists have permanent villages because they depend mostly on food from trees that keep producing for a long time.) In contrast with most recent food-collecting groups, horticultural societies exhibit the beginnings of social differentiation. For example, some individuals may be part-time craftworkers or part-time political officials, and certain members of a kin group may have more status than other individuals in the society.

### Intensive Agriculture

People engaged in **intensive agriculture** use techniques that enable them to cultivate fields permanently. Essential nutrients may be put back in the soil through the use of fertilizers, which may be organic material (most commonly dung from humans or other animals) or inorganic (chemical) fertilizers. But there are other ways to restore nutrients. The Luo of western Kenya plant beans around corn plants. Bacteria growing around the roots of the bean plant replace lost nitrogen, and the corn plant conveniently provides a pole for the bean plant to wind around as it grows. Some intensive agriculturalists use irrigation from streams and rivers to ensure an adequate supply of waterborne nutrients. Crop rotation and plant stubble that has been plowed under also restore nutrients to the soil.

In general, the technology of intensive agriculturalists is more complex than that of horticulturalists. Plows rather than digging sticks are generally employed. But there is enormous variation in the degree to which intensive agriculturalists rely on mechanization rather than hand labor. In some societies, the most complex machine is an animaldrawn plow; in the corn and wheat belts of the United States, huge tractors till, seed, and fertilize 12 rows at a time.27

Let's look at two groups of intensive agriculturalists, those of rural Greece and those of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam.

Rural Greece The village of Vasilika is situated at the foot of Mount Parnassus on the Boeotian plain. As described by Ernestine Friedl in the 1950s, its population was about 220 inhabitants.28 Grapevines and wheat are cultivated for domestic use. The agricultural year begins in March with pruning of the vines and hoeing of the fields, tasks regarded as men's work. Winemaking begins in September, after the grain harvest, and involves the whole family. Men, women, and children talk and joke as they pick the grapes and put them into large baskets. After they remove the leaves and stems, the men trample the fruit, and the newly pressed grape juice, or *must,* is transferred to barrels. After adding whatever sugar and alcohol are needed, farmers also add resin to give the wine its characteristic flavor.

The villagers use horses to plow their wheat fields in October, and in November they sow the seed by hand. The wheat crop is harvested the following summer, usually by machine. Wheat constitutes the staple village food and is eaten as bread, as a cereal (called *trakhana*), or as noodles. It is also commonly bartered for other food items, such as fish, olive oil, and coffee.

Cotton and tobacco are the main **cash crops**—that is, crops raised for sale. In this dry plains country, the success of the cotton crop depends on irrigation, and the villagers use efficient diesel pumps to distribute water. The real work in the cotton fields begins after the spring plowing and seeding have been completed. Then the young plants must be hoed and mulched, a task done mostly by women. The season of cotton cultivation is especially hard on women, who must do all the cooking and household chores in addition to working in the cotton fields. Irrigation, which begins in July, is men's work. It is usually done three times a season and involves the clearing of shallow ditches, the mounting of pumps, and the channeling of water. Cotton picking, which starts in October, is considered women's work. For picking, as well as hoeing and harvesting, a farmer owning more than five acres usually hires women from the same village or neighboring villages and sometimes even from distant towns. The cotton ginning is carried out by centrally located contractors, who are paid on the spot with 6 percent of each farmer's crop. Most of the seed reclaimed in the ginning is used for the next year's planting. The remainder is pressed into cakes to serve as supplementary food for ewes at lambing time. Tobacco yields a larger cash income than cotton, and the tobacco crop fits well into what would otherwise be slack periods in cultivation.

**Intensive agriculture**

Food production characterized by the permanent cultivation of fields and made possible by the use of the plow, draft animals or machines, fertilizers, irrigation, water-storage techniques, and other complex agricultural techniques.

**Cash crops** A cultivated commodity raised for sale rather than for personal consumption by the cultivator.

Raising animals plays a relatively minor role in the villagers' economic life. Each farmer has a horse or two for heavy draft work, a mule or donkey, about two dozen sheep, and some fowl.

Farmers at Vasilika are responsive to modern developments; they are prepared to experiment to a certain extent, especially with mechanization. Where the amount of acreage under cultivation warrants the expense, tractors are hired for plowing. Specialists are regularly called in to handle harvesting, cotton ginning, and similar tasks. Indeed, the Greek farmer is content to be a farmer and to rely on the skills of others to repair his roof, maintain his water pump, and provide the mechanical know-how for crop production.

Rural Vietnam: The Mekong Delta The village of Khanh Hau, situated along the flat Mekong Delta, comprised about 600 families when Gerald Hickey described it in the late 1950s, before the Vietnam War.29 The delta area has a tropical climate, with a rainy season that lasts from May to November. As a whole, the area has been made habitable only through extensive drainage.

Wet rice cultivation is the principal agricultural activity of Khanh Hau. It is part of a complex, specialized arrangement that involves three interacting components: (1) a complex system of irrigation and water control; (2) a variety of specialized equipment, including plows, waterwheels, threshing sledges, and winnowing machines; and (3) a clearly defined set of socioeconomic roles—from those of landlord, tenant, and laborer to those of rice miller and rice merchant.

In the dry season, the farmer decides what sort of rice crop to plant, whether of long (120 days) or short (90 days) maturation. The choice depends on the capital at his disposal, the current cost of fertilizer, and the anticipated demand for rice. The seedbeds are prepared as soon as the rains have softened the ground in May. The soil is turned over (plowed) and broken up (harrowed) as many as six separate times, with two-day intervals for "airing" between operations. During this time, the rice seeds are soaked in water for at least two days to stimulate sprouting. Before the seedlings are planted, the paddy is plowed once more and harrowed twice in two directions at right angles.

Planting is a delicate, specialized operation that must be done quickly and is performed most often by hired male laborers. But efficient planting is not enough to guarantee a good crop. Proper fertilization and irrigation are equally important. In the irrigating, steps must be taken to ensure that the water level remains at exactly the proper depth over the entire paddy. Water is distributed by means of scoops, wheels, and mechanical pumps.

Vietnamese farmers in the Mekong Delta working in a flooded rice paddy. Much of the delta was originally tropical forest.

Successive crops of rice ripen from late September to May; all members of the family may be called upon to help with the harvest. After each crop is harvested, it is threshed, winnowed, and dried. Normally, the rice is sorted into three portions: one is set aside for use by the household in the following year; one is for payment of hired labor and other services (such as loans from agricultural banks); and one is for cash sale on the market. Aside from the harvesting, women do little work in the fields, spending most of their time on household chores. In families with little land, however, young daughters help in the fields and older daughters may hire themselves out to other farmers.

The villagers also cultivate vegetables, raise pigs, chickens, and the like, and frequently engage in fishing. The village economy usually supports three or four implement makers and a much larger number of carpenters.

General Features of Intensive Agricultural Societies Societies with intensive agriculture are more likely than horticulturalists to have towns and cities, a high degree of craft specialization, complex political organization, and large differences in wealth and power. Studies suggest that intensive agriculturalists work longer hours than horticulturalists.30 For example, men engaged in intensive agriculture average 9 hours of work a day, 7 days a week; women average almost 11 hours of work per day. Most of the work for women in intensive agricultural societies involves food processing and work in and around the home, but they also spend a lot of time working in the fields. We discuss some of the implications of the work patterns for women in the chapter on sex and gender.

Intensive agricultural societies are more likely than horticultural societies to face famines and food shortages, even though intensive agriculture is generally more productive than horticulture.31 Why, if more food can be produced per acre, is there more risk of shortage among intensive agriculturalists? Intensive agriculturalists may be more likely to face food shortages because they are often producing crops for a market. Producing for a market pushes farmers to cultivate plants that give them the highest yield rather than cultivating plants that are drought-resistant or that require fewer nutrients. Farmers producing for a market also tend to concentrate on one crop. Crop diversity is often a protection against total crop failure because fluctuations in weather, plant diseases, or insect pests are not likely to affect all the crops. There are also fluctuations in market demand. If the market demand drops and the price falls for a particular crop, farmers may not have enough cash to buy the other food they need.

**Commercialization** The increasing dependence on buying and selling, with money usually as the medium of exchange.

The Commercialization and Mechanization of Agriculture Some intensive agriculturalists produce very little for sale; most of what they produce is for their own use. But there is a worldwide trend for intensive agriculturalists to produce more and more for a market. This trend is called **commercialization**, which may occur in any area of life and which involves increasing dependence on buying and selling, usually with money as the medium of exchange. Some of the push toward commercialization comes from external pressures, from governments that impose taxes that must be paid by money. But some of the shift occurs when subsistence farmers choose to plant a cash crop to earn money for various reasons. For example, the Malaiyali farmers of India grow a cash crop, tapioca (cassava), as a way of responding to unpredictable rainfall. Tapioca is fairly drought-tolerant, grows in poor soils, and can be planted later in the year when the rainfall has become more predictable.32

The increasing commercialization of agriculture is associated with several other trends. One is that farm work is becoming more mechanized as hand labor becomes scarce be-

![](_page_10_Picture_6.jpeg)

cause of migration to industrial and service jobs in towns and cities, or because hired hand labor has become too expensive. A second trend is the emergence and spread of *agribusiness,* large corporation-owned farms that may be operated by multinational companies and worked entirely by hired, as opposed to family, labor. For example, consider how cotton farming has changed in the southeastern United States. In the 1930s, tractors replaced mules and horses used in plowing. This change allowed some landowners to evict their sharecroppers and expand their holdings. After World War II, mechanical cotton pickers replaced most of the harvest laborers. But a farmer had to have a good deal of money to acquire those machines, each of which cost many tens of thousands of dollars.33 So the mechanization of cotton farming sent many rural farm laborers Watering a field in Hula Valley, Israel with robotic irrigation.

off to the cities of the North in search of employment, and the agricultural sector increasingly became big business. A third trend associated with the commercialization of agriculture, including animal raising, is a reduction in the proportion of the population engaged in food production. In the United States today, for example, less than 1 percent of the total population work on farms.34 A fourth trend is that much of what people produce for sale nowadays is shipped to or received from markets in other countries. For example, in the summer months, fruits and vegetables are often shipped to markets where consumers have little local fresh produce. The spread of different kinds of food is not new (see the box "Food on the Move") but is accelerating in today's world. In the next chapter on economics, we discuss more fully some of the apparent consequences of the worldwide changeover to commercial or market economies.

"Market Foraging" in Industrial Societies Food in countries such as the United States and Canada comes largely from intensive agriculture and animal husbandry practiced by a small proportion of the population. Those food specialists make their living by selling animal and plant products to marketers, distributors, and food processors. Indeed, most people know very little about how to grow crops or raise animals. Food appears in markets or supermarkets already processed by other specialists. It comes in paper or plastic packages, looking far different from how it originally looked in the field or on the feedlot. Thus, most of us are "market foragers," collecting our food from stores. In some ways, we behave very much like foragers of wild plants and animals. But there are also enormous differences between our kind of foraging and the original kind. If our society did not have very productive intensive agriculture and animal husbandry, we would not have towns and cities, thousands of different full-time occupations (hardly any of which are involved in food-getting), a centralized government, or many of our other characteristics.

### Pastoralism

Most agriculturalists keep and breed some animals (practice animal husbandry), but a small number of societies depend mostly for their living on domesticated herds of animals that feed on natural pasture.35 We call such a system **pastoralism**. We might assume that pastoralists breed animals to eat their meat, but most do not. Pastoralists more often get their animal protein from live animals in the form of milk, and some pastoralists regularly take blood, which is rich in protein, from their animals to mix with other foods. The herds often indirectly provide food because many pastoralists trade animal products for plant foods and other necessities. In fact, a large proportion of their food may actually come from trade with agricultural groups.36 For example, some pastoral groups in the Middle East derive much of their livelihood from the sale of what we call oriental rugs, which are made from the wool of their sheep on hand looms. Two pastoral societies we shall examine are the Basseri of southern Iran and the Saami of Scandinavia.

The Basseri The Basseri, described by Fredrik Barth as of the 1960s, are a tribe of about 16,000 tent-dwelling nomads.37 Their herds consist principally of sheep and goats, though donkeys and camels are raised for pulling or carrying, and the wealthier men have horses for riding. Theirs is a dry, arid habitat, with rainfall averaging no more than 10 inches a year. The Basseri's pastoral way of life is based on a regular, migratory exploitation of the grazing lands within their territory, which measures about 15,000 square miles in all. In winter, when the mountains to the north are covered with snow, the plains and foothills to the south offer extensive pasturage. During the spring, grazing is excellent on a plateau near the center of the territory. By summer, when most of the lower-lying pastures have dried up, sufficient food for the herds can be found in the mountains at an altitude of nearly 6,000 feet.

Annual migrations are so important to the economies of the Basseri and other pastoralist societies of that region that they have developed the concept of *il-rah,* or "tribal road." A major pastoral tribe such as the Basseri has a traditional route and schedule. The route, consisting of the localities in the order in which each is visited, **Pastoralism** A form of subsistence technology in which food-getting is based directly or indirectly on the maintenance of domesticated animals.

## **Migrants and Immigrants**

### Food on the Move

eople in North America get most of their food from stores. Most people do not know where the food comes from originally—where it was first grown or raised. This is partly because relatively few are directly involved in food-getting (less than 1 percent of the workers in the United States). Even when you count all the activities related to food-getting, such as marketing and transportation, only 14 percent of U.S. workers have anything to do with the production and distribution of food. But nowadays, many of the foods we buy in markets-tacos, salsa, bagels, pasta, pizza, sausage, soy sauce, and teriyaki-have become mainstream "North American" food. Where did these foods come from? Originally, they were eaten only by ethnic and immigrant minorities who came to the United States and Canada. Some, but not all, of their foods caught on and became widely consumed. They became, in short, as "American" as apple pie.

The ingredients in many of these food items resulted from previous movements of people even further back in time. Consider the ingredients in pizza, a favorite food now for many of us. The dough is made from wheat flour, which was first grown in the Middle East, perhaps as much as 10,000 years ago. How do anthropologists know that? Archaeologists have discovered wheat kernels that old in Middle Eastern sites, and they have found flat stones and stone rolling pins from that time that we know were used to grind kernels into flour (we can tell from microscopic analysis of the residue on the stone). What about other ingredients that may be found in pizza? Cheese was first made in

the Middle East too, at least 5,000 years ago (we have writings from that time that mention cheese). Tomatoes were first grown in South America, probably several thousand years ago. They got to Italy, the birthplace of the tomato pie (which became transformed into pizza), less than 200 years ago. Just 100 years ago, tomatoes (the key ingredient in pizza for some) were so new in eastern Europe that people were afraid to eat them because their leaves are poisonous to humans and some other animals. Another food we associate with Italian cuisine, spaghetti-type noodles, came to Italy (from China) less than 500 years ago. So the major ingredients of pizza, just like round-noodle pasta, are all not native to Italy.

The amazing thing about foods is that they so often travel far and wide, generally carried by the people who like to eat them. And some of our foods, when alive, also travel widely. For example, the bluefin tuna (which can weigh more than a thousand pounds) swims thousands of miles from feeding to breeding grounds in the North Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Caribbean. This largest of all existing fishes is being hunted into extinction because its meat is so prized for what the Japanese call sushi, a kind of food that has spread from Japan throughout the world.

follows existing passes and lines of communication. The schedule, which regulates the length of time each location will be occupied, depends on the maturation of different pastures and the movements of other tribes. The *il-rah* is regarded, in effect, as the property of the tribe. Local populations and authorities recognize the tribe's right to pass along roads and cultivated lands, to draw water from the public wells, and to pasture flocks on public land.

The Basseri herd sheep and goats together, with one shepherd (a boy or unmarried man) responsible for a flock of 300 to 400 animals. Children of both sexes are usually responsible for herding the baby animals (lambs and kids). Milk and its byproducts are the most important commodities, but wool, hides, and meat are also important to the economy of the Basseri. Both wool and hides are traded, but they are even more useful within the tribe. The Basseri, especially the women, are skilled spinners and weavers, and much of their time is spent at these activities. Saddlebags and pack bags are woven on horizontal looms from homespun wool and hair, as are carpets, sleeping rugs, and the characteristic black tents made of panels of woven goat hair. Woven goat hair provides an exceptionally versatile cloth. For winter use, it retains heat and repels water; in the summer, it insulates against heat and permits free circulation of air. Lambskin hides also serve many purposes. When plucked and turned inside out, they are made into storage bags to hold water, buttermilk, sour milk, and other liquids.

Most of the Basseri must trade for the necessities and luxury items they do not produce within the community. The staple items they sell are butter, wool, lambskins, rope, and occasionally livestock.

The Saami The Saami (Lapps) practice reindeer herding in northwestern Scandinavia where Finland, Sweden, and Norway share common frontiers. It is a typical Arctic habitat: cold and windswept, with long, dark days for half the year. Considerable change has occurred recently, so we first discuss the food-getting strategy in the 1950s, as described by Ian Whitaker and T. I. Itkonen.38

The Saami herd their reindeer either intensively or, more often, extensively. In the *intensive system,* the herd is constantly under observation within a fenced area for the whole year. Intensively herded reindeer and other animals are accustomed to human contact. Hence, the summer corralling of the females for milking and the breaking in of the ox-reindeer for use as work animals are not difficult tasks. The *extensive system* involves allowing the animals to migrate over a large area. It requires little surveillance and encompasses large herds. Under this system, the reindeer are allowed to move through their seasonal feeding cycles watched by only one or two scouts. The other Saami stay with the herd only when it has settled in its summer or winter habitat. But milking, breaking in, and corralling are harder in the extensive than in the intensive system because the animals are less accustomed to humans.

A Saami reindeer herder feeds two of her animals in the snow.

![](_page_13_Picture_6.jpeg)

Even under the extensive system, which theoretically permits Saami to engage in subsidiary economic activities such as hunting and fishing, the reindeer herd is the essential, if not the only, source of income. A family might possess as many as 1,000 reindeer, but usually the figure is half that number. Studies show 200 to be the minimum number of reindeer needed to provide for a family of four or five adults. Women may have shared the herding chores in the past under the intensive system, but now, under the extensive system, men do the herding. Women still do the milking. The Saami eat the meat of the bull reindeer; the female reindeer are kept for breeding purposes. Bulls are slaughtered in the fall, after the mating season. Meat and hides are frequently sold or bartered for other food and necessities.

Reindeer are still herded nowadays, but snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, and even helicopters have replaced sleds for herding. Ferries move reindeer to and from different pastures, and the herders communicate by field telephones. With faster transportation, many Saami now live in permanent homes and can still get to their herds in hours. Saami children spend much of their time in school and, consequently, do not learn much of the herding ways. The Norwegian government now regulates pastoralism, licensing pastoralists and trying to limit the number of reindeer they can herd.<sup>39</sup> And many Saami no longer have reindeer.

### The Effect of Food-Getting on the Environment

any people are now aware of industrial pollution—the dumping of industrial wastes in the ground or into rivers, the spewing of chemicals into the air through smokestacks—but we don't often realize how much humans have altered the environment by the ways they collect and produce food. Consider irrigation. Irrigation has made aariculture productive in arid or unpredictable rainfall environments. Water can be channeled from rivers: rainwater can be caught in terraces carved out of hillsides; ancient water can be pumped up from vast underground reservoirs called aquifers. Plants absorb water and leave behind the salts, so over time the land may get saltier. But much of the water use is wasteful and evaporates into the air before even reaching the plants, leading to higher concentration of minerals and salts. If drainage is poor and if the water table rises, the salt concentrations are not washed away. Eventually, the soil becomes too salty to grow crops effectively and crops have to be grown elsewhere.

Some archaeologists have suggested that the accumulation of toxic salts in the soil at least partly explains the doom or decline of various groups in the past. For example, salinization probably contributed to the decline of Sumer, an early

empire in Mesopotamia, and other early states in what is now southern Iraq and southwestern Iran. Today, much of the soil is still too salty for cultivation. Irrigation schemes during Saddam Hussein's regime also seriously degraded the downstream Iraqi marshes, putting over 60 bird species at risk. The loss of the marshlands reduced the ability of the marshland to filter the water before it reached the Persian Gulf, which led to declines in productivity of the coastal fisheries.

The lessons of history have not been learned yet. The San Joaquin Valley of California, perhaps the most productive agricultural area in the world, now has a serious salinization problem. One solution in many of the areas of the Great American Desert is to pump water up from underground. Indeed, in many places there is a great deal of water underground. For example, the Ogallala aquifer, which underlies parts of Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico, contains water left from the ice ages. But the pumping solution, if it is a solution, is only a short-term fix, for the huge Ogallala aquifer is also the fastest-disappearing aquifer. The only question is how long it will take to disappear totally.

Too many people raising too many animals can also have serious effects

on the environment. The European-American settlers raised cattle and sheep on the Great American Desert, but many parts of it were overgrazed. It took the swirling dust storms of the 1930s to make people realize that overgrazing as well as poor farming practices could be disastrous. The problems are not just recent ones. The Norse colonized Greenland and Iceland around A.D. 800; but overgrazing of pasture undoubtedly contributed to soil erosion and the disappearance or decline of the colonies by A.D. 1500.

Are environmental problems associated only with food production? Although food producers may be the worst offenders, there is reason to think that foragers may also have sometimes overfished, overgathered, or overhunted. For example, some scholars suspect that the movement of humans into the New World was mainly responsible for the disappearance of the mammoth. Unfortunately, there is little evidence that humans have been good conservers in the past. That does not mean that humans cannot do better in the future—but they have to want to.

General Features of Pastoralism In recent times, pastoralism has been practiced mainly in grassland and other semiarid habitats that are not especially suitable for cultivation without some significant technological input such as irrigation. Most pastoralists are nomadic, moving camp fairly frequently to find water and new pasture for their herds. But other pastoralists have somewhat more sedentary lives. They may move from one settlement to another in different seasons, or they may send some people out to travel with the herds in different seasons. Pastoral communities are usually small, consisting of a group of related families.40 Individuals or families may own their own animals, but the community makes decisions about when and where to move the herds.

As we have noted, there is a great deal of interdependence between pastoral and agricultural groups. That is, trade is usually necessary for pastoral groups to survive. Like agriculturalists, pastoralists are more vulnerable than foragers and horticulturalists to famine and food shortages. Pastoralists usually inhabit drought-prone regions, but recent pastoralists have had their access to grazing lands reduced, and political pressures have pushed them to decrease their movement over large areas. Mobility kept the risk of overgrazing to a minimum, but overgrazing in small territories has increased the risk of desertification.<sup>41</sup>

# Environmental Restraints on Food-Getting

Of great interest to anthropologists is why different societies have different methods of getting food. Archaeological evidence suggests that major changes in food-getting, such as the domestication of plants and animals, have been independently invented in at least several areas of the world. Yet, despite these comparable inventions and their subsequent spread by diffusion and migration, there is still wide diversity in the means by which people obtain food.

How much does the physical environment affect food-getting? Anthropologists have concluded that the physical environment by itself has a restraining, rather than a determining, effect on the major types of subsistence. Because they have very short growing seasons, cold regions of the earth are not particularly conducive to growing plants. No society we know of has practiced agriculture in the Arctic; instead, people who live there rely primarily on animals for food. But both foraging (as among the Inuit) and food production (as among the Saami) can be practiced in cold areas. Indeed, cross-cultural evidence indicates that neither foraging nor food production is significantly associated with any particular type of habitat.42

We know that foraging has been practiced at one time or another in almost all areas of the earth. The physical environment does seem to have some effect on what kind of foraging is practiced, that is, on the extent to which foragers will depend on plants, animals, or fish. Farther away from the equator, foragers depend much less on plants for food and much more on animals and fish.43 Lewis Binford argues that fishing becomes increasingly important in cold climates because foragers need nonportable housing in severe winters to protect themselves from the cold. Therefore, they cannot rely on large animals, which usually have to feed themselves by moving over considerable distances in the winter. Fishing is more localized than hunting, and therefore foragers who rely on fishing can stay in their nonportable houses in winter.44

There is one habitat that may have precluded foraging until recent times. If it were not for the nearness of food producers, particularly agriculturalists, recent foragers, such as the Mbuti of central Africa, could probably not have supported themselves in the tropical forest habitats where they now live.45 Tropical forests are lush in plants, but they do not provide much in the way of reachable fruits, seeds, and flowers that humans can eat. Animals are available in tropical forests, but typically they are lean and do not provide humans with sufficient carbohydrates or fat. Like the Mbuti groups who hunt and gather in the forest, many tropical foragers trade for agricultural products; other collectors cultivate some crops in addition to hunting and gathering. It would seem, then, that foragers could not survive in tropical forests were it not for the carbohydrates they obtain from agriculturalists.

15.3 Identify environmental restraints on food-getting.

![](_page_16_Picture_1.jpeg)

Aerial view of irrigated fields, major canal and arid desert in Imperial Valley, California. In the past, this environment only supported foragers.

When we contrast horticulture and intensive agriculture, the physical environment appears to explain some of the variation. Approximately 80 percent of all societies that practice horticulture or simple agriculture are in the tropics, whereas 75 percent of all societies that practice intensive agriculture are not in tropical forest environments.46 Tropical forests have abundant rainfall. But despite the attractiveness of lush vegetation and brilliant coloring, tropical forestlands do not usually offer favorable environments for intensive agriculture. Perhaps the heavy rainfall quickly washes away certain minerals from cleared land. Also, the difficulty of controlling insect pests and weeds, which abound in tropical forests,47 may make intensive agriculture less productive.

But difficulty is not impossibility. Today, there are some areas, for instance the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, whose tropical forests have been cleared and prevented from growing again by the intensive cultivation of rice in paddies. And, although cultivation is not normally possible in dry lands, because of insufficient natural rainfall to sustain crops, agriculture can be practiced where there are oases—small, naturally watered areas where crops can be grown with a simple technology—or rivers that can be tapped by irrigation, one of the techniques used with intensive agriculture.

The animals that pastoralists raise depend primarily on grass for food, so it is not surprising that pastoralism is typically practiced in grassland regions of the earth. These regions may be **steppes** (dry, low grass cover), **prairies** (taller, better-watered grass), or **savannas** (tropical grasslands). The grassland habitat favors large game and hence supports both hunting and pastoral technologies, except where machine technology makes intensive agriculture possible, as in parts of the United States, Canada, and Ukraine.

Very different strategies of food-getting have been

practiced in the same environment over time. A dramatic illustration is the history of the Imperial Valley in California. The complex systems of irrigation now used in that dry-land area have made it a very productive region. Yet about 400 years ago, this same valley supported only hunting and gathering groups who subsisted on wild plants and animals.

It is evident from the Imperial Valley example and many others like it that the physical environment does not by itself account for the system of food-getting in an area. Even a polar environment could have agriculture with heated greenhouses, though it would be too expensive. Technological advances as well as enormous capital investment in irrigation, labor, and equipment have made intensive agriculture possible in the Imperial Valley. But the agriculture there is precarious, depending on sources of water and power from elsewhere. In a prolonged drought, it may be difficult or too expensive to obtain the needed water. And should the prices for vegetables fall, the farming businesses in the Imperial Valley could find themselves unable to finance the investment and borrowing of capital that they need to continue. So technological, social, and political factors rather than environmental factors mostly determine what kind of food-getting can be practiced in a given environment.

# The Origin of Food Production

From about 40,000 to about 15,000 years ago, which we know best archaeologically for Europe, people seem to have gotten most of their food from hunting the available migratory herds of large animals, such as wild cattle, antelope, bison, and mammoths. These hunter-gatherers were probably highly mobile to follow the migrations of the animals.

Beginning about 14,000 years ago, people in some regions began to depend less on big game hunting and more on relatively stationary food resources, such as fish, shellfish, small game, and wild plants. Saltwater and freshwater food supplies may have become more abundant in many areas after the glaciers withdrew. As the ice melted, the level of the oceans rose and formed inlets and bays where crabs, clams, and sea mammals could be found. In some areas, particularly Europe and the Near East, the exploitation of local and relatively permanent resources may have supported an increasingly settled way of life.

We see the first evidence of a changeover to food production—the cultivation and domestication of plants and animals—in the Near East about 8000 b.c. This shift occurred, probably independently, in other areas as well. There is evidence of cultivation around 6000 b.c. in China, Southeast Asia (what is now Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam), and Africa. In the New World, there appear to have been several places of original cultivation and domestication. The highlands of Mexico (about 7000 b.c.) and the central Andes around Peru (by about 6000 b.c.) were probably the most important in terms of food plants used today.

Most peoples today are food producers rather than foragers. But why did people start to produce their food? We know that an economic transformation occurred in widely separate areas of the world beginning about 10,000 years ago, as people began to domesticate plants and animals. But why did domestication occur? And why did it occur independently in different places within a period of a few thousand years? (Considering that people depended only on wild plants and animals for millions of years, the differences in exactly when domestication first occurred in different parts of the world seem small.)

There are many theories of why food production developed; most have tried to explain the origin of domestication in the Near East. Lewis Binford and Kent Flannery suggested that some change in external circumstances, not necessarily environmental, must have induced or favored the changeover to food production.48 As Flannery pointed out, there is no evidence of a great economic incentive for hunter-gatherers to become food producers. In fact, as we have seen, some contemporary hunter-gatherers may actually obtain adequate nutrition with far less work than many agriculturalists.

Binford and Flannery thought that the incentive to domesticate animals and plants may have been a desire to reproduce what was wildly abundant in the most bountiful or optimum hunting and gathering areas. Because of population growth in the optimum areas, people might have moved to surrounding areas containing fewer wild resources. In those marginal areas, people would have turned to food production to reproduce what they used to have.

The Binford-Flannery model seems to fit the archaeological record in the Levant, the southwestern part of the Fertile Crescent, where population increase did precede the first signs of domestication.49 But as Flannery admitted, in some regions, such as southwestern Iran, the optimum hunting and gathering areas do not show population increase before the emergence of domestication.50

The Binford-Flannery model focuses on population pressure in a small area as the incentive to turn to food production. Mark Cohen theorized that population pressure on a global scale explains why so many of the world's peoples adopted agriculture within the span of a few thousand years.51 He argued that hunter-gatherers all over the world gradually increased in population, so that the world was more or less filled with foragers by about 10,000 years ago. Thus, people could no longer relieve population pressure by moving to uninhabited areas. To support their increasing populations, they would have had to exploit a broader range of less desirable wild foods; that is, they would have had to switch to broad-spectrum collecting, or they would have had to increase the yields of the most desirable wild plants by weeding, protecting them from animal pests, and perhaps deliberately planting the most productive among them. Cohen suggested that people might have tried a variety of these strategies to support themselves but would generally have ended up depending on cultivation because that would have been the most efficient way to allow more people to live in one place.

Recently, some archaeologists have returned to the idea that climatic change played a role in the emergence of agriculture. It seems clear from the evidence now available that the climate of the Near East about 13,000 to 12,000 years ago became more seasonal; the summers got hotter and drier, and the winters became colder. These climatic changes may have favored the emergence of annual species of grain that archaeologically we see

proliferating in many areas of the Near East.52 Some foragers intensively exploited the seasonal grains, developing an elaborate technology for storing and processing the grains and giving up their previous nomadic existence to do so. The transition to agriculture may have occurred when sedentary foraging no longer provided sufficient resources for the population. This change could have happened for a number of reasons. First, sedentarization itself may have led to shortages of resources, either because population increased with sedentarization53 or because people in permanent villages depleted the local wild resources nearby.54 Second, climate change may have reduced the available stands of wild grain. In at least one area of the Near East, the onset of drier and cooler weather may have led foragers to try to cultivate their food supplies.55 Change to a more seasonal climate might also have led to a shortage of certain nutrients for foragers. In the dry seasons, certain nutrients would have been less available. For example, grazing animals become lean when grasses are not plentiful, and so meat from hunting would have been in short supply in the dry seasons. Although it may seem surprising, some recent hunter-gatherers have starved when they had to rely on lean meat. If they could have somehow increased their carbohydrate or fat intake, they might have been more likely to get through the periods of lean game.56 So it is possible that some foragers in the past thought of planting crops to get them through the dry seasons when hunting, fishing, and gathering did not provide enough carbohydrates and fat for them to avoid starvation.

15.5 Describe and critically discuss the spread and intensification of food production.

### The Spread and Intensification of Food Production

Whatever the reasons for the switch to food production, we still need to explain why it supplanted foraging as the primary mode of subsistence. We cannot assume that hunters and gatherers simply adopted production as a superior way of life once they understood the process of domestication. After all, as we have noted, domestication may entail more work and provide less security than the food-collecting way of life.

The spread of agriculture may be linked to the need for territorial expansion. As a sedentary, food-producing population grew, it may have been forced to expand into new territory. Some of this territory may have been vacant, but foragers probably already occupied much of it. Although food production is not necessarily easier than collection, it is generally more productive per unit of land. Greater productivity enables more people to be supported in a given territory. In the competition for land between the faster-expanding food producers and the foragers, the food producers may have had a significant advantage: They had more people in a given area. Thus, the foraging groups may have been more likely to lose out in the competition for land. Some groups may have adopted cultivation, abandoning the foraging way of life to survive. Other groups, continuing as foragers, may have been forced to retreat into areas not desired by the cultivators. Today, as we have seen, the small number of remaining foragers inhabit areas not particularly suitable for cultivation—dry lands, dense tropical forests, and polar regions.

Just as prior population growth might account for the origins of domestication, further population growth and ensuing pressure on resources at later periods might also at least partly explain the transformation of horticultural systems into intensive agricultural systems. Ester Boserup suggested that intensification of agriculture, with a consequent increase in yield per acre, is not likely to develop naturally out of horticulture because intensification requires much more work.57 She argued that people will be willing to intensify their labor only if they have to. Where emigration is not feasible, the prime mover behind intensification may be prior population growth. The need to pay taxes or tribute to a political authority may also have stimulated intensification.

Boserup's argument about intensification is widely accepted. However, her assumption that more work is required with intensive agriculture has recently been questioned. Comparing horticultural (swidden or shifting) rice production with rice produced on permanent fields using irrigation, Robert Hunt found that *less,* not more, labor is required with irrigation.58 Still, population increase may generally provide the impetus to intensify production to increase yields to support the additional people.

Intensive agriculture has not yet spread to every part of the world. Horticulture continues to be practiced in certain tropical regions, and there are still some pastoralists and foragers. Some environments may make it somewhat more difficult to adopt certain subsistence practices. For example, intensive agriculture cannot supplant horticulture in some tropical environments without tremendous investments in chemical fertilizers and pesticides, not to mention the additional labor required.59 And enormous amounts of water may be required to make agriculturalists out of foragers and pastoralists who now exploit semiarid environments. However, difficulty is not impossibility. Anna Roosevelt points out that although horticulture was a common food-getting strategy in Amazonia in recent times, archaeological evidence indicates that there were complex societies practicing intensive agriculture on raised, drained fields in the past.60 The physical environment does not completely control what can be done with it.

# Summary and Review

### Foraging

15.1 Describe foraging and complex foraging, and identify the general societal features associated with food collecting.

- • Foraging—hunting, gathering, and fishing—depends on wild plants and animals and is the oldest human food-getting technology.
- • People in most foraging societies live in small communities that are nomadic or seminomadic. Division of labor is usually only along age and gender lines, personal possessions and land rights are limited, people are usually not differentiated by class, and political leadership is informal.
- • Complex foraging societies have bigger and more permanent communities as well as more social inequality; they tend to depend heavily on fishing. These societies tend to have higher population densities, food storage, occupational specialization, resource ownership, slavery, and competitiveness.

Explain the difference between foraging and complex foraging.

### Food Production

15.2 Describe the various forms of food production (horticulture, intensive agriculture, and pastoralism) and identify the general societal features associated with each.

• Horticultural societies grow crops of all kinds with relatively simple tools and methods and do not

permanently cultivate fields. Many also hunt or fish; a few are nomadic for part of the year. Horticultural societies tend to be larger, more sedentary, and more densely populated than foragers, and they tend to exhibit the beginnings of social differentiation.

- • Intensive agricultural societies use techniques that enable them to cultivate fields permanently, including fertilization, crop rotation, irrigation, and plowing under stubble. Societies using intensive agriculture are more likely than horticulturalists to have towns and cities, a high degree of craft specialization, complex political organization, and large differences in wealth and power.
- • Societies using pastoralism depend mostly on domesticated herds of animals that feed on natural pasture. They tend to be found in drought-prone regions. People in pastoral societies mostly live in small communities that are typically nomadic or seminomadic. Pastoral people typically do not eat their animals but use their milk and blood; they get other foods from trade with agricultural groups.

### Environmental Restraints on Food-Getting

#### 15.3 Identify environmental restraints on food-getting.

• Cross-cultural evidence indicates that neither foraging nor food production is significantly associated with any particular type of habitat.

- • Foragers farther from the equator depend much more on animals and fish; those closer to the equator depend more on plants. It is thought that foragers in tropical forests could not survive without the carbohydrates they obtain from agriculturalists.
- • Approximately 80 percent of all societies that practice horticulture or simple agriculture are in the tropics, whereas 75 percent of all societies that practice intensive agriculture are not in tropical forest environments; an exception is tropical rice paddies. Pastoralism is typically practiced in grassland regions.
- • The physical environment does not by itself account for the system of food-getting in an area; technological, social, and political factors rather than environmental factors mostly determine food-getting practices in a given environment.

### The Origins of Food Production

15.4 Discuss the origin of food production.

- • From about 40,000 to about 15,000 years ago, people seem to have gotten most of their food from hunting migratory herds of large animals.
- • Beginning about 14,000 years ago, some populations began to depend more on relatively stationary food resources such as fish, shellfish, small game, and wild plants, which may have supported an increasingly settled way of life.
- • The first evidence of a changeover to food production the cultivation and domestication of plants and animals is found in the Near East about 8000 b.c., a shift that occurred, probably independently, also in other areas.

• Possible factors influencing food production: (a) As growing populations expanded further from bountiful wild resources, they domesticated animals and plants in an effort to reproduce former abundance; (b) global population growth may have filled most of the world's habitable regions, forcing people to domesticate plants and animals; and (c) climate change may have favored settling near seasonal stands of wild grain, and growing populations in such areas may have led to domestication of plants and animals.

What evidence and theories explain the origin of food production?

### The Spread and Intensification of Food Production

15.5 Describe and critically discuss the spread and intensification of food production.

- • Food production is generally more productive per unit of land than food collection, although it can be more difficult and time consuming.
- • Greater food productivity appears to lead to population growth, which may partially explain competition for land, which gives food producers an advantage over foragers.
- • When emigration is not feasible, greater population growth may lead to intensive agricultural systems, and the need to pay taxes or tribute to a political authority may also stimulate continued intensification.

Why did food production dominate over foraging in many parts of the world?

# Think on it

- 1. Why might meat be valued more than plant foods in many societies?
- 2. Why might foragers be less likely than intensive agriculturalists to suffer from food shortages?
- 3. Why do certain foods in a society come to be preferred?
