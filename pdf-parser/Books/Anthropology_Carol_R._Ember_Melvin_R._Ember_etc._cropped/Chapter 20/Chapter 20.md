**I** n a well-known prose poem published in 1915, Robert Frost tells the story of Mary and Warren, a married couple who own a subsistence farm in the United States. One day the couple's old hired hand, Silas, returns to them after having quit the farm in search of paying work. He is ill and dying. Mary takes him in, but when she tells her husband that Silas has returned "home," Warren, who is less sympathetic, corrects her, saying, Home is where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.

"We," he adds, are not Silas's "kin." Mary, who badly wants to help the old man, is quick to appease her husband by agreeing: "I should have called it something you somehow haven't to deserve."<sup>1</sup>

In a few words, Frost captures what all societies known to anthropology believe about kinship: Kin are the people who are obligated to help you (and you they), whether the help is deserved or not. But societies differ in whom a society defines as "kin," which kin you affiliate with, which kin you live near, how much beyond the immediate family kin matter, and *what* rights and obligations apply to *which* kin. Thus the meaning and the structure of kinship varies.

Before societies formed governments, courts, police departments, armies, and other services, they often depended on their kinship groups to maintain social order, divide up property and goods, and protect the community from harm. Indeed, kinship often determined the destiny of the individual. So fundamental have the rules of kinship been to human culture that they remain central to many people's belief systems even when their economic and social well-being no longer depend upon it.

Why, then, is kinship beyond and even within families less important in North America and other similar societies? Part of the answer lies in an economy where goods and labor are bought and sold, which compels adult men and women to go where the work is. They usually move away and establish a new place of residence apart from their parents or other relatives when they marry, if they have not already moved away before. *Neolocal* (new place) residence profoundly weakens the strength of kinship ties and kinship groups. Living with or near kin, in contrast, makes the formation of strong kin groups more likely. And living with or near kin is the prevailing pattern in most of the world's societies.

Because the rules of kinship are culturally determined, we might expect to find as many kinds of kinship structures as there are societies. Yet, remarkably, scholars have found that there are only a limited number of patterns of kinship structures observed the world over. Moreover, the different aspects of kinship are related to each other. Rules about where couples live after they marry predict the structure of kinship groups, and these in turn predict what types of kin terms they use to refer to their relatives. In North American society, for instance, newlyweds usually set up a separate household. An anthropologist who happens to come from a different kind of society can hazard a pretty good guess about the importance of the nuclear family from the fact that the North American terms for *mother* and *father* are not commonly used to refer to anyone outside the nuclear family, whereas in most societies these terms refer to other people as well; *father* may be the term for the biological father and the father's brother.

As we explore the kinship systems and marital residence patterns of the world, we will see that in most societies the nuclear family is embedded in an important extended family or other larger kin group. Many societies have kin groups that include several or many families and hundreds or even thousands of people, and kinship plays a powerful role in many aspects of an individual's life. But even in societies where kinship is not so important, kin become more important in certain conditions. We may recall, for example, that during the recession in the United States between 2007 and 2009, 1.3 million men and women between the ages of 24 and 34 moved in with their parents. Many elderly people moved in with their relatives as well.2 Kin, it seems, still existed, and they still had to "take you in."

## Patterns of Marital Residence

In many industrial and postindustrial societies, a young man and woman establish **neolocal residence** residence when they marry, setting up a new household apart from their parents and other relatives. In the United States and Canada, some upper-income families begin earlier than others to train their children to live away from home by sending them to boarding schools at age 13 or 14, as well as sleepaway summer camps even earlier. Young adults of all income levels learn to live away from home most of the year if they join the army or attend an out-of-town college. So familiar is neolocal residence to us that we tend to assume that all societies must follow the same practice.

On the contrary, of the 565 societies in Murdock's "World Ethnographic Sample," only about 5 percent have had the practice of setting up separate households for newlyweds.<sup>3</sup> In the vast majority of societies, then, a new couple lives within, or very close to, the household of either the groom's or the bride's parents or other close relatives. It stands to reason that when a newly married couple lives near kin, relatives will play important roles in their lives and those of their offspring. As we will see, the practice of living with and near kin has meant that the kin group has been the basis of social organization in many cultures.

The smallest building block of a society's social structure is the family, usually comprised of at least one married couple and their eventual offspring. With few exceptions, couples in almost all societies live together after they are married. As we noted above, married couples in most societies customarily live with or near kin. Therefore, some young people must leave home when they marry. But which married offspring remain at or near home and which reside elsewhere? We pay particular attention to where these new family units take root and grow because it can predict *which* relatives and other allied groups are likely to be important in a society. Although societies vary in the way they deal with this question, the prevailing pattern of marital residence is likely to be one of the following:

- 1. **Patrilocal residence***.* Sons stay and daughters leave, so that a married couple lives with or near the husband's parents (67 percent of all societies).
- 2. **Matrilocal residence***.* Daughters stay and sons leave, so that a married couple lives with or near the wife's parents (15 percent of all societies).
- 3. **Bilocal (or ambilocal) residence.** Either the son or the daughter may leave, so that the married couple lives with or near either the wife's or the husband's parents (7 percent of all societies).
- 4. **Avunculocal residence***.* Both the son and daughter normally leave, but the son and his wife settle with or near his mother's brother (4 percent of all societies).4
- 5. **Neolocal residence.** Both sons and daughters leave; married couples live apart from the relatives of both spouses (5 percent of all societies).

In these definitions, we use the phrase "the married couple lives *with or near*" a particular set of relatives. When couples live with or near the kin of one spouse, the couple may live in the same household with those kin, creating an *extended-family* household, or they may live separately in an *independent-family* household, but nearby. (Also, in contrast to bilocal residence, matrilocal, patrilocal, and avunculocal residence each specify only one pattern and are often called nonoptional or **unilocal residence**.)

20.1 Describe the various patterns of marital residence.

**Neolocal residence** A pattern of residence whereby a married couple lives separately, and usually at some distance, from the kin of both spouses.

**Patrilocal residence** A pattern of residence in which a married couple lives with or near the husband's parents.

**Matrilocal residence**

A pattern of residence in which a married couple lives with or near the wife's parents.

**Bilocal residence** A

pattern of residence in which a married couple lives with or near either the husband's parents or the wife's parents

**Avunculocal residence**

A pattern of residence in which a married couple settles with or near the husband's mother's brother.

#### **unilocal residence** A pattern of residence (patrilocal, matrilocal, or avunculocal) that specifies just one set of relatives that the married couple lives with or near.

Three Iroquois women sing in an Iroquois longhouse in Ontario. The core of a traditional longhouse were matrilineally related women.

How does place of residence affect the social life of the couple? Of course, it largely determines which people the couple interacts with and depends upon. The group the couple joins is also likely to be more influential in the lives of their offspring. Whether the couple lives in or near the husband's or the wife's parent's place can also be expected to have important consequences for their status. If married couples live patrilocally, as occurs in most societies, the wife may be far from her own kin. The feeling of being an outsider may be particularly strong if the wife has moved into a patrilocal extendedfamily household. She will be an outsider among a group of male relatives who have grown up together.

Among the Tiv of central Nigeria,5 the patrilocal extended family consists of the "great father," who is the head of the household; his younger brothers; his sons; and his younger brothers' sons; followed by all the in-marrying wives and all unmarried children. The sisters and daughters of the head of household who have married will have gone to live where their husbands live. Authority is strongly vested in the male line and particularly in the oldest male of the household. The "great father" determines bride price, settles disputes, administers punishment, and plans for new buildings.

If, on the other hand, the husband comes to live with or near his wife's parents, the wife and her kin take on greater importance, and the husband is the outsider. As we shall see, however, matrilocal marital residence does not endow women with the same power that patrilocal residence confers on men.

## The Structure of Kinship

Anthropologists often speak of the web of kinship as providing the main structure of social action in noncommercial societies. Kinship connections can structure many areas of social life—from the access an individual has to productive resources to the kinds of political alliances formed between communities and larger territorial groups. In some societies, kinship connections have an important bearing on matters of life and death.

Recall the society Shakespeare described in *Romeo and Juliet*. The deadly feud between the kin groups of Romeo, who belonged to the house (or *lineage*) of Montague, and Juliet, who was of the house of Capulet, would lead to their own famously tragic fate. Although Verona in the late medieval period, when the play takes place, was a thriving city-state and a center of commerce, its daily life and political system were dominated by several competing—and at times feuding—kin groups. Sets of kin of common descent that is, descended from the same ancestor—lived together, and allegiance to kin was a serious matter. If a commercial (though preindustrial) society that was ruled by princes and councils of lords could be so structured by kinship, we can imagine how much more essential kinship connections and kin groups are for establishing social order and keeping the peace in noncommercial societies.

If kinship is important, there is still the question of which set of kin a person affiliates with and depends on. After all, if every single relative were regarded as equally important, there would be an unmanageably large number of people depending on each other and, perhaps, competing for the group's limited resources. Consequently, most societies in which kinship connections are important have rules that assign each person to a particular and definable set of kin.

20.2 Discuss the structure of kinship and distinguish among the various types of affiliation.

**rules of descent** Rules that connect individuals with particular sets of kin because of known or presumed common ancestry.

**unilineal descent** Affiliation with a group of kin through descent links of one sex only.

**Patrilineal descent** The rule of descent that affiliates individuals with kin of both sexes related to them through men only.

#### Types of Affiliation with Kin

Societies observe three main types of affiliation with kin: *unilineal descent*, *ambilineal descent*, and *bilateral kinship*. The first two types, unilineal and ambilineal descent, are based on **rules of descent**, which are rules that connect individuals with particular sets of kin because of known or presumed common ancestry. By the particular rule of descent operating in their society, individuals can know more or less immediately which set of kin to turn to for support and help. As we shall see, the interconnections of bilateral kinship, which is not based on rules of descent or ancestry, are more ambiguous.

Unilineal Descent When a person is affiliated with a group of kin through descent links of one sex only—either males only or females only—the kin group is said to follow **unilineal descent**. Unilineal descent can be either patrilineal or matrilineal.

1. **Patrilineal descent** affiliates individuals with kin of both sexes related to them *through men only*. Just as patrilocal residence is much more common than matrilocal residence, patrilineal descent is more common than matrilineal descent. As Figure 20.2 illustrates, children in patrilineal systems in each generation belong to the kin group of their father; their father, in turn, belongs to the group of his father; and so on. Although a man's sons and daughters are all members of the same descent group, affiliation with that group is transmitted only by the sons to their children.

![](_page_4_Figure_13.jpeg)

Individuals 4 and 5, who are the children of 1 and 2, affiliate with their father's patrilineal kin group, represented by the color red. In the next generation, the children of 3 and 4 also belong to the red kin group, because they take their descent from their father, who is a member of that group. However, the children of 5 and 6 do not belong to this patrilineal group, because they take their descent from their father, who is a member of a different group. That is, although the mother of 12 and 14 belongs to the red patrilineal group, she cannot pass on her descent affiliation to her children, and because her husband (6) does not belong to her patrilineage, her children (12 and 14) belong to their father's group. In the fourth generation, only 15 and 16 belong to the red patrilineal group, because their father is the only male member of the preceding generation who belongs to the red patrilineal group. In this diagram, then, 1, 4, 5, 8, 10, 15, and 16 are affiliated by patrilineal descent; all the other individuals belong to other patrilineal groups.

![](_page_5_Figure_1.jpeg)

Individuals 4 and 5, who are the children of 1 and 2, affiliate with their mother's kin group, represented by the color green. In the next generation, the children of 5 and 6 also belong to the green kin group, because they take their descent from their mother, who is a member of that group. However, the children of 3 and 4 do not belong to this matrilineal group, because they take their descent from their mother, who is a member of a different group; their father, although a member of the green matrilineal group, cannot pass his affiliation on to them under the rule of matrilineal descent. In the fourth generation, only 21 and 22 belong to the green matrilineal group, because their mother is the only female member of the preceding generation who belongs. Thus, individuals 2, 4, 5, 12, 14, 21, and 22 belong to the same matrilineal group.

#### **Matrilineal descent**

The rule of descent that affiliates individuals with kin of both sexes related to them through women only.

#### **ambilineal descent** The rule of descent that affiliates individuals with groups of kin related to them through men or women.

#### **double descent or double unilineal**

**descent** A system that affiliates individuals with a group of matrilineal kin for some purposes and with a group of patrilineal kin for other purposes.

2. **Matrilineal descent** affiliates individuals with kin of both sexes related to them *through women only*. In each generation, then, children belong to the kin group of their mother. As Figure 20.3 illustrates, a woman's sons and daughters are all members of the same descent group, but only her daughters can pass on their descent affiliation to their children.

Unilineal rules of descent affiliate an individual with a line of kin extending back in time and into the future. By virtue of this line of descent, whether it extends through males or females, some very close relatives are excluded. For example, in a patrilineal system, your mother and your mother's parents do not belong to your patrilineal group, but your father and his father (and their sisters) do. In your own generation in a matrilineal or patrilineal system, some cousins are excluded, and in your children's generation, some of your nieces and nephews are excluded.

However, although unilineal rules of descent exclude certain relatives from membership in one's kin group, the excluded relatives are not necessarily ignored or forgotten, just as practical considerations restrict the effective size of kinship networks in our own society. Indeed, in many unilineal societies, excluded kin may be entrusted with important responsibilities. For example, when a person dies in a patrilineal society, members of the mother's patrilineal descent group may customarily be accorded the right to perform certain rituals at the funeral.

Unilineal rules of descent can form clear-cut, and hence unambiguous, kinship groups. These groups can, and often do, act as separate units even after the death of individual members.

Referring again to Figures 20.2 and 20.3, we can see that the individuals in the highlighted color belong to the same patrilineal or matrilineal descent group without ambiguity; individuals in the fourth generation belong to the group just as much as those in the first generation. Say the patrilineal group has a name, the Hawks. Individuals know whether or not they are Hawks. If not, they belong to some other group, for each person belongs to only one line of descent. This fact is important if kin groups are to act as separate, nonoverlapping units. It is difficult for people to act together unless they know exactly who should get together. And it is easier for individuals to act together as a group if each one belongs to only one such group or line.

Ambilineal Descent In contrast to unilineal descent, **ambilineal descent** affiliates individuals with kin related to them through men *or* women. In other words, some people in the society affiliate with a group of kin through their fathers; others affiliate through their mothers. Consequently, the descent groups show both female and male genealogical links, as illustrated in Figure 20.4.

The three rules of descent—patrilineal, matrilineal, and ambilineal—are usually, but not always, mutually exclusive. Most societies can be characterized as having only one rule of descent, but two principles are sometimes used to affiliate individuals with different sets of kin for different purposes. Some societies have what is called **double descent or double unilineal descent**, whereby individuals affiliate for some purposes with a group of matrilineal kin and for other purposes with a group of patrilineal kin. Thus, two rules of descent, each traced through links of one sex only, are operative at the same time. For example, if there is a patrilineal system and a matrilineal one, individuals would belong to two groups at birth: the matrilineal group of the mother and the patrilineal group of the father. Imagine combining Figures 20.2 and 20.3. Individuals 4 and 5 would belong to both the patrilineal group (red in Figure 20.2) to which their father belongs and the matrilineal group (green in Figure 20.3) to which their mother belongs.

The way a society assigns names does not necessarily convey information about a rule of descent. Many societies, even with rules of descent, do not give individuals the name of their kin group or of their father or mother. For example, among the patrilineal Luo of Kenya, babies were traditionally given names that described the circumstances of their birth (such as "bornin-the-morning"); their names did not include their father's or kin group's name. Only after the British established a colony in Kenya, and continuing after independence, did children get their father's personal name as a surname. (The British themselves did not acquire surnames until the Middle Ages.)

It is customary in North American society for children to have a last, or "family," name—usually their father's last name. All the people with the same last name do not conceive of themselves as descended from the same common ancestor; all Smiths do not consider themselves related. Nor do such people act together for any particular purpose. Many societies, including our own, do not have lineal (matrilineal, patrilineal, or ambilineal) descent groups—sets of kin who believe they descend from a common ancestor. These are societies with **bilateral kinship**. *Bilateral* means "two-sided," and in this case it refers to the fact that one's relatives on both the mother's and father's sides are equal in importance or, more usually, in unimportance. Kinship reckoning in bilateral societies does not refer to common descent but rather is horizontal, moving outward from close to more distant relatives rather than upward to common ancestors (see Figure 20.5).

The term **kindred** describes a person's bilateral set of relatives who may be called upon for some purpose. Most bilat-

eral societies have kindreds that overlap in membership. In North America, we think of the kindred as including the people we might invite to weddings, funerals, or some other ceremonial occasion; a kindred, however, is not usually a definite group. As anyone who has been involved in creating a wedding invitation list knows, a great deal of time may be spent deciding which relatives ought to be invited and which ones can legitimately be excluded. Societies with bilateral kinship differ in precisely how distant relatives have to be before they are lost track of or before they are not included in ceremonial activities. In societies such as our own, in which kinship is relatively unimportant, fewer relatives are included in the kindred. In other bilateral societies, however, where kinship connections are somewhat more important, more would be included.

![](_page_6_Figure_5.jpeg)

A hypothetical ambilineal group of kin is indicated by the color blue. Members 4 and 5 belong to this group because of a male link, their father (1); members 12 and 14 belong because of a female link, their mother (5); and members 19 and 20 belong because of a male link, their father (12). This is a hypothetical example because any combination of lineal links is possible in an ambilineal descent group.

**bilateral kinship** The type of kinship system in which individuals affiliate more or less equally with their mother's and father's relatives.

**kindred** A bilateral set of close relatives who may be called upon for some purpose.

#### Figure 20.5 Bilateral Kinship

In a bilateral system, the kindred is ego-centered; hence, it varies with different points of reference (except for brothers and sisters). In any bilateral society, the kindred minimally includes parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and first cousins. So, if we look at the close kindred of the brother and sister 20 and 21 (enclosed by the solid line), it would include their parents (9 and 10), their aunts and uncles (7, 8, 11, 12), their grandparents (1, 2, 3, 4), and their first cousins (16–19, 22–25). But the kindred of the brother and sister 24 and 25 (shown by the dashed line) includes only some of the same people (3, 4, 10–12, 20–23); in addition, the kindred of 24 and 25 includes people not in the kindred of 20 and 21 (5, 6, 13–15, 26–29).

**ego** In the reckoning of kinship, the reference point or focal person.

#### **lineage** A set of kin whose members trace descent from a common ancestor through known links.

20.3 Discuss variation in unilineal descent systems.

**clan** A set of kin whose members believe themselves to be descended from a common ancestor or ancestress but cannot specify the links back to that founder; often designated by a totem. Also called a sib.

**sib** See Clan.

**totem** A plant or animal associated with a clan (sib) as a means of group identification; may have other special significance for the group.

**phratry** A unilineal descent group composed of a number of supposedly related clans (sibs).

**moiety** A unilineal descent group in a society that is divided into two such maximal groups; there may be smaller unilineal descent groups as well.

The distinctive feature of bilateral kinship is that, aside from brothers and sisters, no two people belong to exactly the same kin group. Your kindred contains close relatives spreading out on both your mother's and father's sides, but the members of your kindred are affiliated only by way of their connection to you (**ego**, or the focus). Thus, the kindred is an *ego-centered* group of kin. Because different people (except for brothers and sisters) have different mothers and fathers, your first cousins will have different kindreds, and even your own children will have different kindred from yours. The ego-centered nature of the kindred makes it difficult for it to serve as a permanent or persistent group. The only thing the people in a kindred have in common is the ego or focal person who brings them together. A kindred usually has no name, no common purpose, and only temporary meetings centered around the ego.6 Furthermore, because everyone belongs to many different and overlapping kindreds, the society is not divided into clear-cut groups.

Although kindreds may not form clear-cut groups as in a unilineal society, this does not mean that the kindred cannot be turned to for help. In a bilateral society, the kindred may provide social insurance against adversity. Among the Chipewyan of subarctic Canada, for example, people would borrow a fishing net from a kindred member, or ask a kindred member to provide child care for a young person whose parent was ill. But recently, with the national and provincial governments providing resources such as housing and medical assistance, and with the increase in opportunities for wage labor, the kindred has ceased to be the main source of help for people in need. Aid from the state is making kinship less useful.7

## Variation in Unilineal Descent Systems

In a society with unilineal descent, people usually refer to themselves as belonging to a particular unilineal group or set of groups because they believe they share common descent in either the male (patrilineal) or female (matrilineal) line. Anthropologists distinguish several types of unilineal descent groups: lineages, clans, phratries, and moieties.

Lineages A **lineage** is a set of kin whose members trace descent from a common ancestor through known links. There may be *patrilineages* or *matrilineages*, depending on whether the links are traced through males only or through females only. Lineages are often designated by the name of the common male or female ancestor. In some societies, people belong to a hierarchy of lineages. That is, they first trace their descent back to the ancestor of a minor lineage, then to the ancestor of a larger and more inclusive major lineage, and so on.

Clans A **clan** (also sometimes called a **sib**) is a set of kin whose members believe themselves to be descended from a common ancestor, but the links back to that ancestor are not specified. In fact, the common ancestor may not even be known. Clans with patrilineal descent are called *patriclans;* clans with matrilineal descent are called *matriclans*. Clans often are designated by an animal name (Bear, Wolf), called a **totem**, which may have some special significance for the group and, at the very least, is a means of group identification. The word *totem* comes from the Ojibwa Indian word *ototeman*, "a relative of mine." In some societies, people have to observe taboos relating to their clan totem animal. For example, clan members may be forbidden to kill or eat their totem.

Although it may seem strange that an animal or plant should be a symbol of a kin group, animals as symbols of groups are familiar in our own culture. Football and baseball teams, for example, are often named after animals (Detroit Tigers, Baltimore Ravens, Philadelphia Eagles, Chicago Bears). Voluntary associations, such as men's clubs, are sometimes called by the name of an animal (Elks, Moose, Lions). Entire nations may be represented by an animal; we speak, for instance, of the American eagle and the British lion.8 Why humans so often choose animal names to represent groups is an intriguing question for which we have no tested answer as yet.

Phratries A **phratry** is a unilineal descent group composed of supposedly related clans or sibs. As with clans, the descent links in phratries are unspecified.

Moieties When a whole society is divided into two unilineal descent groups, we call each group a **moiety**. (The word *moiety* comes from a French word meaning "half.") The people in each moiety believe themselves to be descended from a common ancestor, although

## **Migrants and Immigrants**

#### **Blood Is Thicker Than Water**

ith the spread of money economies, many societies no longer have important functioning kin groups. Yet the customary functions of such large kin groups as lineages, clans, phratries, and moieties are far from disappearing in the modern world. Lineages continue to be important for many Chinese, as well as for people in various parts of Africa and on islands in the Pacific. In some societies, lineages and clans still control the cultivable land and other valuable property. And, where they no longer serve a direct economic purpose, kinship groups can nonetheless provide social order, a sense of identity, and a belief system.

The duties and rights societies associate with kinship may be particularly useful when it comes time to migrate to other countries. When that time comes, and it comes for millions of people every year, "blood is thicker than water," as the old saying goes. Migrants generally look to settle near or with relatives at first. The relatives may be genealogically close (siblings, uncles, aunts). Or they may be more distantly related members of one's lineage or clan. Indeed, if you come from a region that has lineages, the first person you might look up (even before you leave home) might be a lineage mate.

This is often what happens when Chinese from the Hong Kong area go abroad to seek their fortune. Consider the lineage known as the "Man," one of the five major lineages that dominated political life until the 1960s in the Hong Kong New Territories. Anthropologist James L. Watson has studied this group for more than 35 years, in the area around Hong Kong and in other parts of the world to which they have migrated. The Man had survived for nearly six centuries on a kind of rice grown in the salty paddies along the Shenzhen River, which became the border between British Hong Kong and China in 1898.

San Tin's farmers had faced a crisis in the early 1950s. The markets for their rice were located on the Chinese side of the river, which was no longer reqularly accessible. Unlike other lineages in the area, the Man could not convert to growing vegetables or white rice, which could not be grown in their salty paddies. They had two choices: go to Hong Kong to work in its booming factories or migrate to England to work in Chinese restaurants. Just before the British authorities banned migration to England in 1962, 85 to 90 percent of San Tin's able-bodied men left for Britain, lineage mates following lineage mates, to work in factories and hotels as well as restaurants.

The migrants had little money and few assets. Yet, by the mid-1970s, the diaspora of San Tin had managed to

establish a chain of Chinese restaurants in England and other parts of Europe. Today, most of the grandchildren of the original migrants are wealthy professionals, and some are multimillionaires. Many in the current generation cannot speak or read Cantonese, the Chinese language of their ancestors. They now speak English, Dutch, or German.

People who consider themselves members of the Man lineage trace their descent from Man Sai-go, the ancestor who settled near San Tin in the 14th century. Today, about 4,000 people living in more than 20 countries claim descent from Man Sai-go. The village of San Tin became a remittance economy, with wives, children, and elders left behind, supported by the money sent home by the migrants who returned to San Tin for a visit every few years and then went back to Europe to work. Many of the migrants, when they retired, decided to join their children's families in the diaspora and never again returned to San Tin.

The history of San Tin and its people illustrates how a supposedly premodern form of kinship, the Chinese lineage, is still very much alive in the modern world.

they cannot specify how. Societies with moiety systems usually have relatively small populations (fewer than 9,000 people). Societies with phratries and clans tend to be larger.<sup>9</sup>

**Combinations** Although we have distinguished several different types of unilineal descent groups, we do not wish to imply that all unilineal societies have only one type of descent group. Many societies have two or more types in various combinations. For example, some societies have lineages and clans; others may have clans and phratries but no lineages; and still others may have clans and moieties but neither phratries nor lineages. Aside from the fact that a society that has phratries must also have clans (because phratries are combinations of clans), all combinations of descent groups are possible. Even if societies have more than one type of unilineal kin group—for example, lineages and clans there is no ambiguity about membership. Small groups are simply subsets of larger units; the larger units include people who say they are unilineally related further back in time.

#### **Patrilineal Organization**

Patrilineal organization is the most frequent type of descent system. The Kapauku Papuans, a people living in the central highlands of western New Guinea, are an example of a patrilineal society with various types of descent groups.<sup>10</sup> The hierarchy of groups to which the Kapauku are affiliated by virtue of the patrilineal descent system plays an extremely important part in their lives. All Kapauku belong to a patrilineage, to a patriclan that includes their lineage, and to a patriphratry that includes their clan.

The male members of a patrilineage—all the living males who can trace their actual relationship through males to a common ancestor—constitute the male population of a single village or, more likely, a series of adjoining villages. In other words, the lineage is a *territorial unit*. The male members of the lineage live together by virtue of a patrilocal rule of residence and a fairly stable settlement pattern. A son stays near his parents and brings his wife to live in or near his father's house; the daughters leave home and go to live with their husbands. If the group lives in one place over a long period, the male descendants of one man will live in the same territory. If the lineage is large, it may be divided into sublineages composed of people who trace their descent from one of the sons of the lineage ancestor. The male members of a sublineage live in a contiguous block within the larger lineage territory.

The members of the same patrilineage address each other affectionately, and within this group, a headman maintains law and order. Killing within the lineage is considered a serious offense, and any fighting that takes place is done with sticks rather than lethal weapons such as spears. The sublineage headman tries to settle grievances within the sublineage as quickly and as peacefully as possible. If a sublineage mate commits a crime against outsiders, all members of the sublineage may be considered responsible and their property seized, or a member of the sublineage may be killed in revenge by the victim's kin.

The Kapauku also belong to larger and more inclusive patrilineal descent groups—clans and phratries. All the people of the same clan believe they are related to each other in the father's line, but they are unable to say how they are related. If a member of the patriclan eats the clan's plant or animal totem, it is believed that the person will become deaf. Kapauku are also forbidden to marry anyone from their clan. In other words, the clan is exogamous.

Unlike the members of the patrilineage, the male members of the patriclan do not all live together. Thus, the lineage is the largest group of patrilineal kinsmen that is localized. The lineage is also the largest group of kinsmen that acts together politically. Among clan members, there is no mechanism for resolving disputes, and members of the same patriclan (who belong to different lineages) may even go to war with one another.

The most inclusive patrilineal descent group among the Kapauku is the phratry, each of which is composed of two or more clans. The Kapauku believe that the phratry was originally one clan, but that, in a conflict between brothers of the founding family, the younger brother was expelled, and he formed a new clan. The two resulting clans are viewed as patrilineally related because their founders are said to have been brothers. The members of a phratry observe all the totemic taboos of the clans that belong to that phratry. Intermarriage of members of the same clan is forbidden, but members of the same phratry, if they belong to different clans, may marry.

The Kapauku, then, have lineages with demonstrated kinship links and two kinds of descent groups with unknown descent links (clans and phratries).

#### Matrilineal Organization

Although societies with matrilineal descent seem in many respects like mirror images of their patrilineal counterparts, they differ in one important way. That difference has to do with who exercises authority. In patrilineal systems, descent affiliation is transmitted through males, and it is also the males who exercise authority. Consequently, in the patrilineal system, lines of descent and of authority converge. In a matrilineal system, however, although the line of descent passes through females, females rarely exercise authority in their kin groups. Usually males do. Thus, the lines of authority and descent do not converge.11 Anthropologists do not completely understand why this is so, but it is an ethnographic fact. In any case, because males exercise authority in the kin group, an individual's mother's brother becomes an important authority figure because he is the individual's closest male matrilineal relative in the parental generation. The individual's father does not belong to the individual's own matrilineal kin group and thus has no say in kin group matters.

The divergence of authority and descent in a matrilineal system has some effect on community organization and marriage. Most matrilineal societies practice matrilocal residence. Daughters stay at home after marriage and bring their husbands to live with them; sons leave home to join their wives. But the sons who are required to leave will be the ones who eventually exercise authority in their kin groups. This situation presents a

## **Perspectives on Gender**

#### Variation in Residence and Kinship: What Difference Does It Make to Women?

thnographic evidence suggests that it is hard for a woman in a patrilocal society to move at marriage into another village where her husband has plenty of relatives and she has few. For example, Leigh Minturn gives us the text of a letter that one new Rajput bride sent to her mother shortly after she married into her husband's village. The letter was written when the bride had been gone six weeks, but she repeatedly asked if her mother, her father, and her aunts had forgotten her. She begged to be called home and said her bags were packed. She described herself as "a parrot in a cage" and complained about her in-laws. Seven years later the mother reported the daughter to be happy. Still, a few other brides did have more serious symptoms: ghost possession, 24- to 36-hour comas, serious depression, or suicide. What research has not told us is whether these serious symptoms are present more often in patrilocal, patrilineal societies than in other societies. Conversely, do men have some symptoms in matrilocal, matrilineal societies that they do not have in patrilocal societies? We do not know

What about the status of women? Some research suggests that matrilocality and matrilineality enhance some aspects of women's status, but perhaps not as much as we might think. Even in matrilineal societies, men are usually the political leaders.<sup>12</sup> The main effect of matrilocality and matrilineality appears to be that women control property, but they also tend to have more domestic authority in the home, more equal sexual restrictions, and more value placed on their lives. Alice Schlegel pointed out that women's status only tends to be relatively high in

![](_page_10_Picture_5.jpeg)

matrilineal societies when neither the husband nor the brother dominates. Matrilocality and matrilineality might not enhance women's status because of the dominance of male matrilineal kin, but patrilocality and patrilineality are very likely to detract from women's status. Residence and descent also predict societal attempts to control reproduction. According to Suzanne Frayser, patrilineal societies are more likely than other societies to prohibit premarital and extramarital sex for women, and they are more likely to make it very difficult for a woman to divorce her husband.

Of course, we have to remember that there is considerable variation within patrilocal/patrilineal societies and matrilocal/matrilineal societies. In the patrilineal society that Audrey Smedley studied—the Birom of the Jos Plateau in Nigeria—women were formally barred from owning property, from holding political offices, and from major decision

making. Yet, they had considerable autonomy in their personal lives in everyday life, including the legal right to take on lovers. Indeed, they had considerable indirect influence on decision making and were strong supporters of the patrilineal system. Smedley speculates that women support patrilineality in some environmental circumstances because it serves their interests and those of their children too. For example, male crops are highly valued, but such crops are grown on the more dangerous plains where men risked death at the hands of raiders from other groups. Food was scarce, so it may have been adaptive for everyone, including women, to give special status to men for growing crops in dangerous places.

problem. The solution that seems to have been realized in most matrilineal societies is that, although the males move away to live with their wives, they usually do not move too far away; indeed, they often marry women who live in the same village. Thus, matrilineal societies tend not to be locally exogamous—that is, members often marry people from inside the village—whereas patrilineal societies are often locally exogamous.<sup>13</sup>

The matrilineal organization on Chuuk, a group of small islands in the Pacific, illustrates the general pattern of authority in matrilineal systems.14 The Chuukese have both matrilineages and matriclans. The matrilineage is a property-owning group whose members trace descent from a known common ancestor in the female line. The female lineage members and their husbands occupy a cluster of houses on the matrilineage's land. The property of the lineage group is administered by the oldest brother of the group, who allocates the productive property of his matrilineage and directs the work of the members. He also represents the group in dealings with the district chief and all outsiders, and he must be consulted on any matter that affects the group. There is also a senior woman of the lineage who exercises some authority, but only insofar as the activities of the women are concerned. She may supervise the women's cooperative work (they usually work separately from the men) and manage the household.

Within the nuclear family, the father and mother have the primary responsibility for raising and disciplining their children. When a child reaches puberty, however, the father's right to discipline or exercise authority over the child ceases. The mother continues to exercise her right of discipline, but her brother may interfere. A woman's brother rarely interferes with his sister's child before puberty, but he may exercise some authority after puberty, especially because he is an elder in the child's own matrilineage. On Chuuk, men rarely move far from their birthplace. As Ward Goodenough pointed out, "Since matrilocal residence takes the men away from their home lineages, most of them marry women whose lineage houses are within a few minutes' walk of their own."15

Although there are some differences between patrilineal and matrilineal systems, there are many similarities. In both types of systems there may be lineages, clans, phratries, and moieties, alone or in any combination. These kin groups, in either matrilineal or patrilineal societies, may perform any number of functions. They may regulate marriage, they may come to each other's aid economically or politically, and they may perform rituals together.

20.4 Describe the functions of unilineal descent systems.

## Functions of Unilineal Descent Groups

Unilineal descent groups exist in societies at all levels of cultural complexity.16 Apparently, however, they are most common in noncommercial food-producing, as opposed to foodcollecting, societies.17 Unilineal descent groups often have important functions in the social, economic, political, and religious realms of life.

#### Regulating Marriage

In unilineal societies, individuals are not usually permitted to marry within their own unilineal descent groups. In some, however, marriage may be permitted within more inclusive kin groups but prohibited within smaller kin groups. In a few societies, marriage within the kin group is actually preferred.

But, in general, the incest taboo in unilineal societies is extended to all presumed unilineal relatives. For example, on Chuuk, which has matriclans and matrilineages, people are forbidden to marry anyone from their matriclan by the rule of descent group exogamy. The matrilineage is included within the matriclan, so the rule of descent group exogamy also applies to the matrilineage. Among the Kapauku, who have patriphratries, patriclans, and patrilineages, the largest descent group that is exogamous is the patriclan. The phratry may once have been exogamous, but the exogamy rule no longer applies to it. Some anthropologists have suggested that rules of exogamy for descent groups may have developed because the alliances between descent groups generated by such rules may be selectively favored under the conditions of life most unilineal societies face.

#### Economic Functions

Members of a person's lineage or clan are often required to side with that person in any quarrel or lawsuit, to help him or her get established economically, to contribute to a bride price or fine, and to support the person in life crises. Mutual aid often extends to economic cooperation on a regular basis. The unilineal descent group may act as a corporate unit in landownership. For example, among the Chuukese and the Kapauku, a lineage owns house sites and farmland. Descent group members may also support one another in such enterprises as clearing virgin bush or forest for farmland and providing food and other items for feasts, potlatches, curing rites, and ceremonial occasions, such as births, initiations, marriages, and funerals.

The descent group sometimes views money earned—either by harvesting a cash crop or by leaving the community for a time to work for cash wages—as belonging to all. In recent times, however, young people in some places have shown an unwillingness to part with their money, viewing it as different from other kinds of economic assistance.

#### Political Functions

The word *political*, as used by members of an industrialized society, generally does not apply to the vague powers that may be entrusted to a headman or the elders of a lineage or clan. But these people may have the right to assign land for use by a lineage member or a clan member. Headmen or elders may also have the right to settle disputes between two members within a lineage, although they generally lack power to force a settlement. And they may act as intermediaries in disputes between a member of their own clan and a member of an opposing kin group.

Certainly one of the most important political functions of unilineal descent groups is their role in warfare—the attempt to resolve disputes within and outside the society by violent action. In societies without towns or cities, the organization of such fighting is often in the hands of descent groups. The Tiv of central Nigeria, for instance, know very well at any given moment which lineages they will fight against, which lineages they will join as allies in case of a fight, which they will fight against using only sticks, and which must be attacked using bows and arrows.

#### Religious Functions

A clan or lineage may have its own religious beliefs and practices, worshiping its own gods or goddesses and ancestral spirits. The Tallensi of West Africa revere and try to pacify their ancestors. They view life as we know it as only a part of human existence; for them, life existed before birth and will continue after death. The Tallensi believe that the ancestors of their descent groups have changed their form but have retained their interest in what goes on within their society. They can show their displeasure by bringing sudden disaster or minor mishap and their pleasure by bringing unexpected good fortune. But

![](_page_12_Picture_8.jpeg)

Among the Bhil of India, graveyards have ancestral memorials in the fields.

people can never tell what will please them; ancestral spirits are, above all, unpredictable. Thus, the Tallensi try to account for unexplainable happenings by attributing them to the ever-watchful ancestors. Belief in the presence of ancestors also provides security; if their ancestors have survived death, so will they. The Tallensi religion is thus a religion of that descent group. The Tallensi are not concerned with other people's ancestors; they believe only one's own ancestors can plague or protect one.18

20.5 Describe ambilineal systems.

## Ambilineal Systems

Societies with ambilineal descent groups are far less numerous than unilineal or even bilateral societies. Ambilineal societies, however, resemble unilineal ones in many ways. For instance, the members of an ambilineal descent group believe that they are descended from a common ancestor, although frequently they cannot specify all the genealogical links. The descent group is commonly named and may have an identifying emblem or even a totem; the descent group may own land and other productive resources; and myths and religious practices are often associated with the group. Marriage is often regulated by group membership, just as in unilineal systems, although kin group exogamy is not nearly as common as in unilineal systems. Moreover, ambilineal societies resemble unilineal ones in having various levels or types of descent groups. They may have lineages and higher orders of descent groups, distinguished (as in unilineal systems) by whether or not all the genealogical links to the supposed common ancestors are specified.19

The Samoans of the South Pacific are an example of an ambilineal society.20 Samoa has two types of ambilineal descent groups, corresponding to what would be called clans and subclans in a unilineal society. Both groups are exogamous. Associated with each ambilineal clan are one or more chiefs. A group takes its name from the senior chief; subclans, of which there are always at least two, may take their names from junior chiefs.

The distinctiveness of the Samoan ambilineal system, compared with unilineal systems, is that individuals could belong to a number of ambilineal groups because people may be affiliated with an ambilineal group through their father or mother (and the parents, in turn, could be affiliated with any of their parents' groups). Affiliation with a Samoan descent group is optional, and people may theoretically affiliate with any or all of the ambilineal groups to which they are related. In practice, however, people are primarily associated with one group—the ambilineal group whose land they actually live on and cultivate—although they may participate in the activities (e.g., house building) of several groups. Because a person may belong to more than one ambilineal group, the society is not divided into separate kin groups, in contrast with unilineal societies. Consequently, the core members of each ambilineal group cannot all live together, as they could in unilineal societies, because each person belongs to more than one group and cannot live in several places at once.

Not all ambilineal societies have the multiple descent group membership that occurs in Samoa. In some ambilineal societies, a person may belong to only one group at any one time. In such cases, the society can be divided into separate, nonoverlapping groups of kin.

20.6 Discuss how residence can vary.

## Explaining Variation in Residence

Questions can be raised as to why different societies have different patterns of residence. If married couples in most societies live with or near kin, as in patrilocal, matrilocal, bilocal, and avunculocal patterns of residence, then why do couples in some societies, such as our own, typically live apart from kin? And, among the societies in which couples live with or near kin, why do most choose the husband's side (patrilocal residence), but some the wife's side (matrilocal residence)? Why do some non-neolocal societies allow a married couple to go to either the wife's or the husband's kin (bilocal residence), whereas most others do not allow a choice?

#### Neolocal Residence

Many anthropologists have suggested that neolocal residence is related to the presence of a money or commercial economy. They argue that when people can sell their labor or their products for money, they can buy what they need to live without having to depend on kin. Because money is not perishable, unlike crops and other foods in a world largely lacking refrigeration, it can be stored for exchange at a later time. Thus, a money-earning family can resort to its own savings during periods of unemployment or disability, or it might be able to rely on monetary aid from the government, as in our own society. This strategy is impossible in nonmonetary economies, where people must depend on relatives for food and other necessities if they cannot provide their own for some reason.

There is cross-cultural evidence to support this interpretation. Neolocal residence tends to occur in societies with monetary or commercial exchange, whereas societies without money tend to have patterns of residence that locate a couple near or with kin.<sup>21</sup> The presence of money, then, partially accounts for neolocal residence: Money seems to allow couples to live on their own. Still, this fact does not quite explain why they choose to do so.

One reason may be that couples in commercial societies do better on their own because the jobs available require physical or social mobility. Or perhaps couples prefer to live apart from kin because they want to avoid some of the interpersonal tensions and demands that may be generated by living with or near kin. But why couples, when given money, should *prefer* to live on their own is not completely understood.

#### Matrilocal Versus Patrilocal Residence

It is traditionally assumed that in societies in which married children live near or with kin, the pattern of residence will tend to be patrilocal if males contribute more to the economy and matrilocal if women contribute more. However plausible that assumption may seem, the cross-cultural evidence does not support it. Where men do most of the primary subsistence work, residence is patrilocal no more often than would be expected by chance. Conversely, where women do an equal amount or more of the subsistence work, residence is no more likely to be matrilocal than patrilocal.22 And if we counted all work inside and outside the home, most societies should be matrilocal because women usually do more. But that is not true either; most societies are not matrilocal.

We can predict whether residence will be matrilocal or patrilocal, however, from the type of warfare practiced in the society. In most societies known to anthropology, neighboring communities or districts are enemies. The type of warfare that breaks out periodically between such groups is called *internal*, because the fighting occurs between groups that speak the same language. In other societies, the warfare is never within the same society but only with other language groups. This pattern of warfare is referred to as purely *external*. Cross-cultural evidence suggests that in societies where warfare is at least sometimes internal, residence is almost always patrilocal rather than matrilocal. In contrast, residence is usually matrilocal when warfare is purely external.23

How can we explain this relationship between type of warfare and matrilocal versus patrilocal residence? One theory is that patrilocal residence tends to occur with internal warfare because there may be concern over keeping sons close to home to help with defense. Because women do not usually constitute the fighting force in any society, having sons reside at home after marriage might be favored as a means of maintaining a loyal and quickly mobilized fighting force in case of surprise attack from nearby. If warfare is purely external, however, people may not be so concerned about keeping their sons at home because families need not fear attack from neighboring communities or districts.

With purely external warfare, then, the pattern of residence may be determined by other considerations, especially economic ones. If the women do most of the primary subsistence work in societies with purely external warfare, families might want their daughters to remain at home after marriage, so the pattern of residence might become matrilocal. If warfare is purely external but men still do more of the primary subsistence work, residence should still be patrilocal. Thus, the need to keep sons at home after marriage when there

## **Applied Anthropology**

#### From Cross-Cultural Research to Archaeology: Reconstructing Marital Residence in the Prehistoric U.S. Southwest

pplied anthropology uses anthropological knowledge to solve problems. Usually, the problem is a practical problem outside anthropology. For example, forensic anthropology applies biological anthropology to help solve murders and other crimes. But sometimes the application is from one subfield of anthropology to another.

Cross-cultural studies using ethnographic data indicate that sisters are very likely to live in the same household if marital residence is matrilocal. The family unit is therefore likely to be larger with matrilocal residence, and the living (nonstorage) floor area of the house is also likely to be larger. In contrast to patrilocal societies, where the average living floor area is about 29 square meters (generally ranging from 14 to 43 square meters), the living floor area in matrilocal societies averages 175 square meters (generally ranging from 79 to 271 square meters). Apparently, sisters have less trouble living together than nonsisters, perhaps because they have grown up together.

Most anthropologists would assume that a relationship derived from comparative ethnography on preindustrial societies would apply also to human behavior in the prehistoric past. If that is true, and there is no good reason to doubt it, archaeological sites with living floor areas totaling more than 79 square meters are likely to have had matrilocal marital residence. This prediction has been applied to the transition from pit houses to great houses in the U.S. Southwest. The pit houses between A.D. 500 and A.D. 700

![](_page_15_Picture_6.jpeg)

averaged 15 square meters in floor area, in contrast to the multiroom households from A.D. 900 to A.D. 1100 (as in Pueblo Bonito in New Mexico's Chaco Canyon) that ranged in size from 70 square meters to 300 square meters). The latter households were probably matrilocal. Archaeologists know that the households had multiple rooms because there are double walls between adjacent households.

Years ago, some archaeologists suggested that a descent line of matrilineally related women, who would have occupied a site over time if couples lived matrilocally, should exhibit distinctive pottery

design elements when compared with the pottery from other sites. After all, mothers would have taught daughters who would have taught their daughters. Perhaps because their calculations and measures were not simple counts such as number of potsherds found, the work by these pioneering archaeologists was ignored if not rejected. The study of kinship in archaeology, following the findings of cross-cultural research, is still wide open, particularly to investigators who are trained in statistical methods

Sources: Peregrine 2001b; M. Ember 1973; Divale 1977; Hill 1970; Longacre 1970.

is internal warfare may take precedence over any considerations based on division of labor. Perhaps only when internal warfare is nonexistent may a female-dominant division of labor give rise to matrilocal residence.<sup>24</sup>

The frequent absence of men because of long-distance trade or wage labor in distant places may also provide an impetus for matrilocal residence even after warfare ceases. For example, among the Miskito of eastern Central America, matrilocality allowed domestic and village life to continue without interruption when men were away from home for

long periods of time, working as lumberers, miners, and river transporters. More recently, men have worked away from home as deep-sea divers for lobster, for which there is a lot of demand in the international economy. These jobs were not always available, but when they were, the men went away to work at them to earn money. Even though some men would always be away from home, the Miskito continued to get food in their traditional ways, from farming (done mostly by the women) and from hunting and fishing (which was mostly men's work).25

#### Bilocal Residence

In societies that practice bilocal residence, a married couple goes to live with or near either the husband's or the wife's parents. Although this pattern seems to involve a choice for the married couple, theory and research suggest that bilocal residence may occur out of necessity instead. Elman Service suggested that bilocal residence is likely to occur in societies that have recently suffered a severe and drastic loss of population because of the introduction of new infectious diseases.26 Over the last 400 years, contact with Europeans in many parts of the world has resulted in severe population losses among non-European societies that lacked resistance to the Europeans' diseases. If couples need to live with some set of kin to make a living in noncommercial societies, it seems likely that couples in depopulated, noncommercial societies might have to live with whichever spouse's parents and other relatives are still alive. This interpretation is supported by the cross-cultural evidence. Recently depopulated societies tend to have bilocal residence or frequent departures from unilocality, whereas societies that are not recently depopulated tend to have one pattern or another of unilocal residence.27

In hunter-gatherer societies, a few other circumstances may also favor bilocal residence. Bilocality tends to be found among those hunter-gatherers who have very small bands or unpredictable and low rainfall. Residential "choice" in these cases may be a question of adjusting marital residence to where the couple will have the best chance to survive or to find close relatives with whom to live and work.28 Figure 20.6 illustrates the main predictors of the various marital residence patterns.

#### Avunculocal Residence

Now that we have learned about matrilineal systems, the avunculocal pattern of residence, whereby married couples live with or near the husband's mother's brother, may become clearer. Although avunculocal residence is relatively rare, just about all

#### Do Neolocality and Rebellious Teenagers Go Together?

I n the United States, it is nearly taken for granted that adolescence brings turmoil and parent-child conflict. Teenagers, parents, and educators worry about how to reduce the conflict. But why does the conflict occur in the first place? Is it "natural" for adolescents to be rebellious? Are they rebellious in all cultures? If not, why not?

Margaret Mead first raised this issue in her bestselling ethnography, *Coming of Age in Samoa*, in which she observed that adolescence caused little conflict among the Samoans she lived with during the 1920s. Some researchers criticized her analysis, but many field and comparative studies by anthropologists have since found that, indeed, adolescence is not experienced in the same way in all societies. In a systematic crosscultural study of adolescence, Alice Schlegel and Herbert Barry concluded that relations between adolescents and their families were generally harmonious around the world. They suggested that when family members depend upon each other throughout their lives, independence, as expressed in adolescent rebelliousness, would be foolhardy. Indeed, Schlegel and Barry found that adolescents are likely to be rebellious only in societies, like our own, that have neolocal residence and considerable job and geographic mobility. Why should this be? We can speculate that adolescent rebellion in a mobile society is an elaborate psychodrama that both parents and children play out to prepare themselves for separation. Adolescents know that they must leave their parents soon, a prospect that may arouse anxiety.

What if our social structure were different? What if children, as well as their parents, knew that some among them were going to spend the rest of their lives with or near their parents? And even those children who moved away knew, as they would in societies practicing matrilocal, patrilocal, avunculocal, or bilocal residence, that they were going to spend the rest of their

![](_page_17_Picture_7.jpeg)

lives with or near another kin group, their in-laws. Could teenagers in nonneolocal societies afford to have serious conflicts with their parents? Could parents afford serious conflicts with teenagers who would not be leaving when they matured and married? We think not. We suggest that adolescent conflict would be too disruptive of the social order in a non-neolocal society; it would, therefore, have to be minimized or suppressed.

There is another reason why rebellious teenagers may be associated with neolocal family structure. Neolocal households commonly occur in societies whose economies are based on commerce, a kind of livelihood that presents people with more choices, particularly in the rapidly changing modern world. If children must know and do things that their parents do not know about, is a generation gap inevitable?

Not necessarily. Other conditions are probably also necessary to generate parent-child conflict, if the example of a Moroccan town is any guide. As part of a comparative research project on adolescence, Susan and Douglas Davis interviewed young people in a small Moroccan town that had experienced a lot of cultural change. Parents mostly worked in agricultural jobs; their children aspired to urban, white-collar jobs. Grandparents had rarely seen a car; teenagers

took trains to the capital. Only a few parents had gone to school; most teenagers were schooled. Yet little serious parent–child conflict occurred. In fact, 40 percent of the teenagers said that they had never disagreed with their mothers.

What conditions other than rapid social change might account for the difference between Moroccan and North American teenagers? Morocco has an authoritarian political structure with a monarchy and a clear hierarchy of offices. Moroccan society rewards allegiance to the group, and adults in the Moroccan town avoided open conflict. Can teenagers rebel in a society that discourages conflict and personal autonomy? Further research is needed to untangle the web of cause and effect that predicts rebellion in teenagers. We need to study samples of cultures that have different combinations of neolocality, rapid change, cultural emphasis on individual autonomy, and an authoritarian political system. Whatever we discover in the future about its cause, we know now that adolescent rebelliousness is neither inevitable nor natural, but that it is probably linked to other aspects of cultural variation as Margaret Mead suggested many years ago.

avunculocal societies are matrilineal. As we have seen, the mother's brother plays an important role in decision making in most matrilineal societies. Aside from his brothers, who is a boy's closest male matrilineal relative? It is his mother's brother. Going to live with the mother's brother, then, provides a way of localizing male *matrilineal* relatives. But why should some matrilineal societies practice that form of residence? The answer may involve the prevailing type of warfare.

Avunculocal societies, in contrast with matrilocal societies, fight internally. Like patrilocality, avunculocality may be a way of keeping related—in this case, matrilineally related married men together to mount a quick defense against surprise attacks from nearby. When faced with fighting close to home, societies with strong, functioning matrilineal descent groups may choose to switch initially to avunculocality rather than patrilocality. Such a transition would make sense when the close warfare results in high male mortality, which could make patrilineal descent more difficult to trace in such societies than matrilineal descent.29

## The Emergence of Unilineal Systems

Unilineal kin groups play an essential role in the organization of many societies. But not all societies have such groups. In societies that have complex systems of political organization, officials and agencies take over many of the functions that kin groups might perform, such as organizing work and warfare and allocating land. But not all societies that lack complex political organization have unilineal descent systems. Why, then, do some societies have unilineal descent systems, but others do not?

It is generally assumed that unilocal residence, patrilocal or matrilocal, is necessary for the development of unilineal descent. Patrilocal residence, if practiced for some time in a society, will generate a set of patrilineally related males who live in the same territory. Matrilocal residence over time will similarly generate a localized set of matrilineally related females. It is no wonder, then, that matrilocal and patrilocal residence patterns are crossculturally associated with matrilineal and patrilineal descent, respectively.30

Athough unilocal residence might be necessary for the formation of unilineal descent groups, it apparently is not the only condition required. For one thing, many societies with unilocal residence lack unilineal descent groups. For another, even though related males or related females live together by virtue of a patrilocal or matrilocal rule of residence, it does not necessarily follow that the related people will actually view themselves as a descent group and function as such. What other conditions are needed, then, to impel the formation of unilineal descent groups?

There is evidence that unilocal societies that engage in warfare are more apt to have unilineal descent groups than those without warfare.31 The presence of warfare may provide societies that lack complex political organization with an impetus to form an unambiguous, single line of descent. After all, the unity of the group is more certain when no other clan, phratry, or moiety vies for their loyalty.32 A unilineal descent group can function as a discrete unit—and do so mostly, perhaps, in warfare.

## Explaining Ambilineal and Bilateral Systems

Why do some societies have ambilineal descent groups? Although the evidence is not clear-cut, it may be that societies with unilineal descent groups are transformed into ambilineal ones under special conditions, particularly depopulation. We have noted that depopulation may transform a previously unilocal society into a bilocal society. If a previously unilocal society also had unilineal descent groups, the descent groups may become transformed into ambilineal groups. If a society used to be patrilocal and patrilineal, for example, but some couples began to live matrilocally, their children would be associated through their mother with a previously patrilineal descent group on whose land they

20.7 Explain the emergence of unilineal descent systems.

20.8 Explain how ambilineal and bilateral systems might emerge.

may be living. Once this situation happens regularly, the unilineal principle may become transformed into an ambilineal principle.33 Thus, ambilineal descent systems may be a recent development resulting from depopulation caused by the introduction of European diseases.

The conditions that favor bilateral systems are in large part opposite to those that favor unilineal descent. As we discussed, unlineal descent seems to develop in a nonstate society with unilocal residence that has warfare. If one needs an unambigious set of allies, bilateral systems are unlikely to provide them. Recall that bilateral systems are ego-centered; and every person, other than siblings, has a slightly different set of kin to rely on. Consequently, in bilateral societies, it is often not clear to whom one can turn and which person has responsibility for aiding another. Such ambiguity, however, might not be a liability in societies without warfare. In complex political systems that organize fighting on behalf of large populations, a standing army usually provides the fighting force, and mobilization of kin is not so important. Perhaps because warfare is somewhat less likely in foraging societies,34 bilateral systems may often develop in foraging societies, just like bilaterality is likely in more complex societies because they don't need to rely on descent groups for war. Neolocal residence, which becomes more common with commercialization and market exchange, also works against unilineal descent and therefore also makes a bilateral system more likely.

20.9 Explain the various systems of kinship terminology.

#### **classificatory terms**

Kinship terms that merge or equate relatives who are genealogically distinct from one another; the same term is used for a number of different kin.

#### **consanguineal kin** One's biological relatives; relatives by birth.

**affinal kin** One's relatives by marriage.

## Kinship Terminology

Our society, like all others, has **classificatory terms** for kinds of kin. Most of us probably never stop to think about why we name relatives the way we do. For example, we call our mother's brother and father's brother (and often mother's sister's husband and father's sister's husband) by the same term—*uncle*. It is not that we are unable to distinguish between our mother's or father's brother or that we do not know the difference between **consanguineal kin** (blood kin) and **affinal kin** (kin by marriage, or what we call *in-laws*). Instead, it seems that we do not usually find it necessary to distinguish between various types of uncles in our society.

However natural our system of classification may seem to us, numerous anthropological field studies have revealed that societies differ markedly in how they group or distinguish relatives. The kinship terminology used in a society may reflect its prevailing kind of family, its rule of residence, its rule of descent, and other aspects of its social organization. Kin terms may also give clues to prior features of the society's social system, if, as many anthropologists believe,35 the kin terms of a society are very resistant to change. The major systems of kinship terminology are the Inuit (Eskimo) system, the Omaha system, the Crow system, the Iroquois system, the Sudanese system, and the Hawaiian system.

Because it is the most familiar to us, let us first consider the kinship terminology system employed in our own and many other commercial societies. But it is by no means confined to commercial societies. In fact, this system is found in many Inuit societies.

![](_page_19_Figure_12.jpeg)

#### Inuit, or Eskimo System

The distinguishing features of the Inuit, or Eskimo system (see Figure 20.7) are that all cousins are lumped together under the same term but are distinguished from brothers and sisters; all aunts are lumped under the same term and distinguished from the mother; and all uncles are lumped under the same term and distinguished from the father. In Figure 20.7 and in subsequent figures, the kin types that are referred to by the same term are colored and marked in the same way; for example, in the Inuit system, kin types 2 (father's brother) and 6 (mother's brother) are referred to by the same term (*uncle* in English). Note that in this system—in contrast to the others we

will examine—no other relatives are generally referred to by the same terms used for members of the nuclear family—mother, father, brother, and sister.

The Inuit type of kinship terminology is not generally found where there are unilineal or ambilineal descent groups; the only kin group that appears to be present is the bilateral kindred.36 Remember that the kindred in a bilateral kinship system is an ego-centered group. Although relatives on both my mother's and my father's sides are equally important, my most important relatives are generally those closest to me. This is particularly true in our society, where the nuclear family generally lives alone, separated from and not particularly involved with other relatives except on ceremonial occasions. Because the nuclear family is most important, we would expect to find that the terminology for kin types in the nuclear family is different from the terminology for all other relatives. And the mother's and father's sides are equally important (or unimportant), so it makes sense that we use the same terms (*aunt, uncle*, and *cousin*) for both sides of the family.

#### Omaha System

The Omaha system of kin terminology is named after the Omaha of North America, but the system is found in many societies around the world, usually those with patrilineal descent.37 Referring to Figure 20.8, we can see immediately which types of kin are lumped together in an Omaha system. First, father and father's brother (numbers 2 and 3) are both referred to by the same term. This way of classifying relatives contrasts markedly with ours, in which no term that applies to a member of the nuclear family (father, mother, brother, sister) is applied to any other relative. What could account for the Omaha system of lumping? One interpretation is that the father and father's brother are lumped in this system because most societies in which this system is found have patrilineal kin groups. Both father and father's brother are in the parental generation of my patrilineal kin group and may behave toward me similarly. My father's brother also probably lived near me as a child because patrilineal societies usually have patrilocal residence. The term for father and father's brother, then, might be translated "male member of my patrilineal kin group in my father's generation."

A second lumping, which at first glance appears similar to the lumping of father and father's brother, is that of mother and mother's sister (4 and 5), both of whom are called by the same term. But more surprisingly, mother's brother's daughter (16) is also referred to by this term. Why? If we think of the term as meaning "female member of my mother's patrilineage of *any* generation," then the term makes sense. Consistent with this view, all the male members of my mother's patrilineage of any generation (mother's brother, 6; mother's brother's son, 15) are also referred to by one term.

It is apparent, then, that relatives on the father's and the mother's sides are grouped differently in this system. For members of my mother's patrilineal kin group, I lump all male members together and all female members together regardless of their generation. Yet for members of my father's patrilineal kin group, I have different terms for the male and female members of different generations. George Peter Murdock suggested that a society lumps kin types when there are more similarities than differences among them.<sup>38</sup>

Using this principle, and recognizing that societies with an Omaha system usually are patrilineal, I realize that my father's patrilineal kin group is the one to which I belong and in which I have a great many rights and obligations. Consequently, people of my father's generation are likely to behave quite differently toward me than are people of my own generation. Members of my patrilineal group in my father's generation are likely to exercise authority over me, and I am required to show them respect. Members of my patrilineal group in my own generation are those I am likely to play with as a child and to be friends with. Thus, in a patrilineal system, people on my father's side belonging to different generations are likely to be distinguished.

![](_page_20_Figure_8.jpeg)

![](_page_21_Picture_1.jpeg)

On the other hand, my mother's patrilineage is relatively unimportant to me (because I take my descent from my father). And because my residence is probably patrilocal, my mother's relatives will probably not even live near me. Thus, inasmuch as my mother's patrilineal relatives are comparatively unimportant in such a system, they become similar enough to be lumped together.

Finally, in the Omaha system, I refer to my male parallel cousins (my father's brother's son, 9; and my mother's sister's son, 13) in the same way I refer to my brother (12). I refer to my female parallel cousins (my father's brother's daughter, 10, and my mother's sister's daughter, 14) in the same way I refer to my sister (12). Considering that my father's brother and mother's sister are referred to by the same terms I use

**siblings** A person's brothers and sisters.

for my father and mother, this lumping of parallel cousins with **siblings** (brothers and sisters) is not surprising. If I call my own mother's and father's children (other than myself) "brother" and "sister," then the children of anyone whom I also call "mother" and "father" ought to be called "brother" and "sister" as well.

#### Crow System

The Crow system, named after another North American culture, has been called the mirror image of the Omaha system. The same principles of lumping kin types are employed, except that the Crow system is associated with matrilineal descent,39 so the individuals in my mother's matrilineal group (which is my own) are not lumped across generations, whereas the individuals in my father's matrilineal group are. Comparing Figure 20.9 with Figure 20.8, we find that the lumping and separating of kin types are much the same in both, except that the lumping across generations in the Crow system appears on the father's side rather than on the mother's side. In other words, I call both my mother and my mother's sister by the same term (because both are female members of my matrilineal descent group in my mother's generation). I call my father, my father's brother, and my father's sister's son by the same term (all male members of my father's matrilineal group in any generation). I call my father's sister and my father's sister's daughter by the same term (both female members of my father's matrilineal group). And I refer to my parallel cousins in the same way I refer to my brother and sister.

#### Iroquois System

The Iroquois system (see Figure 20.10), named after the Iroquois of North America, is like the Omaha and Crow systems in that I refer to my father and my father's brother (2 and 3) by the same term, and my mother and my mother's sister (4 and 5) by the same

The Iroquois longhouses could house over 80 people. The female members of a matrilineage with their in-marrying husbands traditionally lived in one longhouse.

term. However, unlike the Omaha and Crow systems, the Iroquois system treats cousins of my own generation differently. In the Omaha and Crow systems, one set of crosscousins is lumped in the kinship terminology with the generation above. In the Iroquois system, both sets of cross-cousins (mother's brother's children, 15 and 16; and father's sister's children, 7 and 8) are referred to by the same terms, distinguished by sex. That is, mother's brother's daughter and father's sister's daughter are both referred to by the same term. Also, mother's brother's son and father's sister's son are referred to by the same term. Parallel cousins always have terms different from those for cross-cousins and are sometimes, but not always, referred to by the same terms as one's brother and sister.

Like the Omaha and Crow systems, the Iroquois system has different terms for relatives on the father's and the mother's sides. Such differentiation tends to be associated with unilineal descent, which is not surprising because unilineal descent involves affiliation with either mother's or father's kin. Why Iroquois, rather than Omaha or Crow, terminology occurs in a unilineal society requires explanation. One possible explanation is that Omaha or Crow is likely to occur in a developed, as opposed to a developing or decaying, unilineal system.40 Another possibility is that Iroquois terminology emerges in societies that prefer marriage with both cross-cousins,41 who are differentiated from other relatives in an Iroquois system.

![](_page_22_Figure_2.jpeg)

Unlike the Omaha, Crow, and Iroquois systems, the Sudanese system usually does not lump any relatives in the parents' and ego's generations. That is, the Sudanese system is usually a *descriptive system*, in which a different **descriptive term** is used for *each* of the relatives, as shown in Figure 20.11. What kinds of societies are likely to have such a system? Although societies with Sudanese terminology are likely to be patrilineal, they probably are different from most patrilineal societies that have Omaha or Iroquois terms. Sudanese terminology is associated with relatively great political complexity, class stratification, and occupational specialization. It has been suggested that under such conditions, a kinship system may reflect the need to make fine distinctions among members of descent groups who have different opportunities and privileges in the occupational or class system.42

The Omaha, Crow, Iroquois, and Sudanese systems, although different from one another and associated with somewhat different predictors, share one important feature: The terms used for the mother's and father's side of the family are not the same. If you imagine folding the kinship terminology diagrams in half, the two sides would not be the same. As we have seen in the Inuit system, however, the terms on the mother's and father's side of the family are *exactly* the same. This feature suggests that the two sides of the family are equally important or equally unimportant. The Hawaiian system discussed next also has the same terms on both sides, but kinship outside the nuclear family is more important.

#### Hawaiian System

The Hawaiian system of kinship terminology is the least complex in that it uses the smallest number of terms. In this system, all relatives of the same sex in the same generation are referred to by the same term (see Figure 20.12). Thus, all my female cousins are referred to by the same term as my sister; all male cousins are referred to by the same term as my brother. Everyone known to be related to me in my parents' generation is referred to by one term if female (including my mother) and by another term if male (including my father).

The fact that societies with Hawaiian kin terminology tend not to have unilineal descent groups43 helps explain why kinship terms are the same on both sides of the family.

![](_page_22_Figure_8.jpeg)

![](_page_22_Picture_9.jpeg)

![](_page_22_Figure_10.jpeg)

**descriptive term** A unique term used for a distinct relative.

Why are the terms for mother, father, sister, and brother used for other relatives? Perhaps because societies with Hawaiian terminology are likely to have large extended families44 to which every type of relative in Figure 20.12 may belong because of alternative (bilocal) residence patterns.45 So, in contrast to our own society, many kin are very important, a fact that seems to be reflected in the practice of referring to other relatives with the same terms that are used for nuclear family members.

## Summary and Review

## Patterns of Marital Residence

20.1 Describe the various patterns of marital residence.

- • In many industrial and postindustrial societies, a young man and woman establish neolocal residence when they marry, setting up a new household apart from their parents and other relatives. Worldwide, that practice is much less common.
- • The more common practice of living with and near kin has meant that kin have been an important basis of social organization in many cultures.
- • Patterns of marital residence include patrilocal, matrilocal, bilocal, avunculocal, and neolocal. Place of residence largely determines which people the couple and their offspring interact with and depend on and can affect what status a wife or husband has.

![](_page_23_Picture_8.jpeg)

How does the custom of patrilocal and matrilocal marital residence affect males and females?

## The Structure of Kinship

20.2 Discuss the structure of kinship and distinguish among the various types of affiliation.

- • The web of kinship provides the main structure of social action in noncommercial societies. Most societies in which kinship connections are important have rules that assign each person to a particular and definable set of kin.
- • Societies observe three types of affiliations: unilineal, ambilineal, and bilateral kinship. Unilineal and ambilineal rules of descent connect individuals through known or presumed common ancestry. Bilateral descent is not based on a line of descent but moves outward to relatives on both sides of one's family.

- • Unilineal descent forms clear and unambiguous groups of kin. This may also be true of ambilineal descent.
- • *Kindred* describes one's bilateral relatives but it is usually not a clearly defined group. In bilateral kinship, aside from brothers and sisters, no two people belong to exactly the same kin group. People in a kindred have in common only the focal person who brings them together.

What is the difference between unilineal, ambilineal and bilateral affiliations?

## Variation in Unilineal Descent Systems

20.3 Discuss variation in unilineal descent systems.

- • Unilineal descent groups comprise four types: lineages (kin of definite descent from an ancestor), clans (kin of believed descent from an ancestor), phratries (unilineal groups of supposedly related clans), and moieties (either of a society's two unilineal groups).
- • Many unilineal societies have two or more types of descent groups in various combinations.
- • In patrilineal systems, descent affiliation is through males, and males also tend to exercise authority; in matrilineal systems descent affiliation is through females, but females do not usually exercise authority in many spheres of life. The reason for the difference is unclear.
- • In matrilocal and matrilineal societies, women tend to control property. They also tend to have more domestic authority, have more equal sexual restrictions, and be more valued. Patrilocality and patrilineality are very likely to detract from women's status.

![](_page_23_Picture_24.jpeg)

How do patrilineal and matrilineal systems affect women's status?

### Functions of Unilineal Descent Groups

#### 20.4 Describe the functions of unilineal descent systems.

- • Unilineal descent groups exist in societies at all levels of cultural complexity but are most common in noncommercial food-producing societies. Unilineal descent groups often have important functions in the social, economic, political, and religious realms of life.
- • Specific functions of descent groups include regulating marriage, economic aid, assistance with work enterprises, contributions to social occasions, assigning land rights, defense, and settling of disputes within and outside the society.

![](_page_24_Picture_5.jpeg)

Give an example for each of four functions (social, economic, political, and religious) of unilineal descent groups.

## Ambilineal Systems

#### 20.5 Describe ambilineal systems.

- • Societies with ambilineal descent groups are far less numerous than unilineal or even bilateral societies.
- • Ideas in ambilineal societies about descent from a common ancestor, identifying names or emblems, and regulation of land use and marriage resemble those of unilineal societies.

![](_page_24_Picture_11.jpeg)

What distinguishes ambilineal systems from other types of descent systems?

#### Explaining Variation in Residence

#### 20.6 Discuss how residence can vary.

- • Cross-cultural evidence shows that neolocal residence is related to the presence of a commercial economy. Perhaps this is because when people can sell their labor or their products, they can buy what they need to live without depending on kin.
- • Cross-cultural evidence does not support the idea that, in societies in which married children live near or with kin, the pattern of residence will tend to be patrilocal if males contribute more to the economy and matrilocal if women contribute more.

- • Where warfare is at least sometimes internal, residence is usually patrilocal, probably because people may want to keep their sons at home to ward off attack from neighboring communities. Residence is usually matrilocal when warfare is purely external, particularly if women contribute substantially to subsistence.
- • The frequent absence of men because of long distance trade or wage labor in distant places may also provide an impetus for matrilocal residence.
- • Theory and research suggest that bilocal residence may occur out of necessity in societies that have recently suffered a severe and drastic loss of population resulting from the introduction of new infectious diseases and in small hunter-gatherer societies with unpredictable rainfall.
- • Avunculocal residence, which puts matrilineallyrelated males together, may be favored by internal warfare when the society is matrilineal.

![](_page_24_Picture_21.jpeg)

What factors influence development of neolocal, matrilocal, patrilocal, and avunculocal societies?

#### The Emergence of Unilineal Systems

20.7 Explain the emergence of unilineal descent systems.

- • Unilocal residence, whether patrilocal or matrilocal, is probably necessary for the development of unilineal descent but does not by itself predict unilineal societies.
- • There is evidence that unilocal societies that engage in warfare are more apt to have unilineal descent groups than those without warfare.

![](_page_24_Picture_27.jpeg)

How do issues of warfare affect the development of unilineal systems?

#### Explaining Ambilineal and Bilateral Systems

20.8 Explain how ambilineal and bilateral systems might emerge.

• Societies with unilineal descent groups may be transformed into ambilineal ones under special conditions, particularly depopulation, and may be a recent development resulting from depopulation caused by the introduction of European diseases.

- • The conditions that favor bilateral systems are generally opposite to those that favor unilineal descent.
- • In complex political systems, standing armies provide the fighting force, so mobilization of kin is less important. Neolocal residence, more common with commercialization, also works against unilineal descent and makes a bilateral system more likely.

![](_page_25_Picture_3.jpeg)

What factors favor the likelihood of bilateral systems, and what factors favor the likelihood of ambilineal systems?

## Kinship Terminology

20.9 Explain the various systems of kinship terminology.

- • Anthropological field studies show that societies differ markedly in how they group or distinguish relatives. The kinship terminology used in a society may reflect its prevailing kind of family, rule of residence, rule of descent, and other aspects of its social organization.
- • The major systems of kinship terminology are the Inuit (Eskimo) system, the Omaha system, the Crow system, the Iroquois system, the Sudanese system, and the Hawaiian system.
- • The Inuit type of kinship terminology is not generally found where there are unilineal or ambilineal

descent groups; the only kin group that appears to be present is the bilateral kindred, so the same terms are used for both sides of the family.

- • The Omaha and Crow systems of kin terminology are associated with unilineal descent (patrilineal and matrilineal, respectively). The terms differ on each side of the family and are lumped across generations on the less important side of the family.
- • The Iroquois system is like the Omaha and Crow systems in having terms for "mother" and "father" extend beyond the nuclear family, but the Iroquois system does not have lumping across generations. No cousins have the same terms as in the parental generation.
- • The Sudanese system uses a different term for *each* relative. The system is associated with relatively great political complexity, class stratification, and occupational specialization and may reflect the need to make fine distinctions among members of descent groups.
- • The Omaha, Crow, Iroquois, and Sudanese systems, although different from one another, share one important feature: The terms used for the mother's and father's side of the family are not the same.
- • The Hawaiian system of kinship terminology, the least complex, uses the smallest number of terms. All relatives of the same sex in the same generation are referred to by the same term.

In what ways do kinship terminology systems reflect social organization?

## Think on it

- 1. What other things about our society would change if we practiced other than neolocal residence?
- 2. Why does kinship provide the main structure of social action in many noncommercial societies?
- 3. Why might it be important for unilineal descent groups to not overlap in membership?
