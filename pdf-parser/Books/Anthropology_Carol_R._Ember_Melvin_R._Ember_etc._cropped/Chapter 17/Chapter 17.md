long-enduring value in the United States is the belief that "all men are created ðŸ”¼ equal." These famous words from the American Declaration of Independence do not mean that all people are equal in wealth or status but rather that all (including women nowadays) are supposed to be equal before the law. Equality before the law is the ideal. But the ideal is not always the actuality. Some people have advantages in legal treatment, and they generally also have advantages of other kinds, including economic advantages. Without exception, recent and modern industrial and postindustrial societies such as our own are *socially stratified*â€”that is, they contain social groups such as families, classes, or ethnic groups that have unequal access to important advantages such as economic resources, power, and prestige.

Hasn't such inequality always existed? Anthropologists, based on firsthand observations of recent societies, would say not. To be sure, even the simplest societies (in the technological sense) have some differences in advantages based on age, ability, or genderâ€”adults have higher status than children, the skilled more than the unskilled, men more than women (we discuss this topic in the chapter on sex and gender). But anthropologists would argue that egalitarian societies exist where social groups (e.g., families) have more or less the same access to rights or advantages, as they tend to in foraging and horticultural societies. Not only do the economic systems of many food collectors and horticulturalists promote equal access to economic resources for all families in the community, but such societies also tend to emphasize the sharing of food and other goods, which tends to equalize any small inequalities in resources between families. Until about 10,000 years ago, all human societies depended on food they hunted, gathered, and/or fished. And so we might expect that egalitarianism characterized most of human history. That is indeed what archaeologists suggest. Substantial inequality generally appears only with permanent communities, centralized political systems, and intensive agriculture, which are cultural features that began to appear in the world only in the last 10,000 years. Before that time, then, most societies were probably egalitarian. In the world today, egalitarian societies have all but disappeared because of two processesâ€”the global spread of commercial or market exchange and the voluntary or involuntary incorporation of many diverse people into large, centralized political systems. In modern societies, some groups have more advantages than others. These groups may include *ethnic* groups. That is, ethnic diversity is almost always associated with differential access to advantages. When ethnic diversity is also associated with differences in physical features such as skin color, the social stratification may involve *racism*, the belief that some "racial" groups are inferior.

Systems of social stratification are strongly linked to the customary ways in which economic resources are allocated, distributed, and converted through labor into goods and services. So we would not expect much inequality if all people had relatively equal access to economic resources. But stratification cannot be understood solely in terms of economic resources; there are other benefits such as prestige and power that may be unequally distributed. We first examine how societies vary in their systems of stratification. Then we turn to possible explanations of why they vary.

#### Economic resources

Things that have value in a culture, including land, tools and other technology, goods, and money.

17.1 Discuss concepts relating to the variation in degree of social inequality.

**Power** The ability to make others do what they do not want to do or influence based on the threat of force.

# Variation in Degree of Social Inequality

Societies vary in the extent to which social groups, as well as individuals, have unequal access to advantages. We are concerned with differential or unequal access to three types of advantages:  $(1)$  wealth or economic resources,  $(2)$  power, and  $(3)$  prestige. **Economic** resources are things that have value in a culture; they include land, tools and other technology, goods, and money. **Power**, a second but related advantage, is the ability to make others do what they do not want to do; power is influence based on the threat of force. When groups in a society have rules or customs that give them unequal access to wealth or resources, they generally also have unequal access to power. So, for example, when we speak of a "company town" in the United States, we are referring to the fact that the

company that employs most of the residents of the town usually has considerable control over them. Finally, there is the advantage of **prestige**. When we speak of prestige, we mean that someone or some group is accorded particular respect or honor. Even if it is true that there is always unequal access by individuals to prestige (because of differences in age, gender, or ability), some societies in the ethnographic record have no social groups with unequal access to prestige.

Thus, anthropologists conventionally distinguish three types of society in terms of the degree to which different social groups have unequal access to advantages: *egalitarian, rank*, and *class societies* (see Table 17.1). Some societies in the ethnographic record do not fit easily into any of these three types; as with any classification scheme, some cases seem to straddle the line between types.1 **Egalitarian societies** contain no social groups with greater or lesser access to economic resources, power, or prestige. **Rank societies** do not have very unequal access to economic resources or to power, but they do contain social groups with unequal access to prestige. Rank societies, then, are partly stratified. **Class societies** have unequal access to all three advantagesâ€”economic resources, power, and prestige.

# Egalitarian Societies

Egalitarian societies can be found not only among foragers such as the !Kung, Mbuti, Australian aborigines, Inuit, and AchÃ©, but also among horticulturalists such as the YanomamÃ¶ and pastoralists such as the Lapps. An important point to keep in mind is that egalitarian does not mean that all people within such societies are the same. There will always be differences among

In egalitarian societies, such as among the Mbuti hunter-gatherers, houses tend to look the same.

**Prestige** Being accorded particular respect or honor.

**Egalitarian societies** Societies in which all people of a given age-sex category have equal access to economic resources, power, and prestige.

**Rank societies** Societies that do not have any unequal access to economic resources or power, but with social groups that have unequal access to status positions and prestige.

17.2 Describe the characteristics of egalitarian societies.

**Class societies** Societies containing social groups that have unequal access to economic resources, power, and prestige.

individuals in age and gender and in such abilities or traits as hunting skill, perception, health, creativity, physical prowess, attractiveness, and intelligence. According to Morton Fried, egalitarian means that, within a given society, "there are as many positions of prestige in any given age/ sex grade as there are persons capable of filling them."2 For instance, if a person can achieve high status by fashioning fine spears, and if many people in the society fashion such spears, then many acquire high status as spear makers. If high status is also acquired by carving bones into artifacts, and if only three people are considered expert carvers of bones, then only those three achieve high status as carvers. But the next generation might produce 8 spear makers and 20 carvers. In an egalitarian society, the number of prestigious positions is adjusted to fit the number of qualified candidates. We would say, therefore, that such a society is not socially stratified.

There are, of course, differences in position and prestige arising out of differences in ability. Even in an egalitarian society, differential prestige exists. But, although some people may be better hunters or more skilled artists than others, there is still *equal access* to status positions for people of the same ability. Any prestige gained by achieving high status as a great hunter, for instance, is neither transferable nor inheritable. Because a man is a great hunter, it is not assumed that his sons are also great hunters. There also may be individuals with more influence, but it cannot be inherited, and there are no groups with appreciably more influence over time. An egalitarian society keeps inequality at a minimal level.

Any differences in prestige that do exist are not related to economic differences. Egalitarian groups depend heavily on *sharing*, which ensures equal access to economic resources despite differences in acquired prestige. For instance, in some egalitarian communities, some members achieve higher status through hunting. But even before the hunt begins, how the animal will be divided and distributed among the members of the band has already been decided according to custom. The culture works to separate the status that members achieveâ€”recognition as great huntersâ€”from actual possession of the wealth, which in this case would be the slain animal.

Just as egalitarian societies do not have social groups with unequal access to economic resources, they also do not have social groups with unequal access to power. As we will see later in the chapter on political life, unequal access to power by social groups seems to occur only in state societies, which have full-time political officials and marked differences in wealth. Egalitarian societies use a number of customs to keep leaders from dominating others. Criticism and ridicule can be very effective. The Mbuti of central Africa shout down an overassertive leader. When a Hadza man (in Tanzania) tried to get people to work for him, other Hadza made fun of him. Disobedience is another strategy. If a leader tries to command, people just ignore the command. In extreme cases, a particularly domineering leader may be killed by community agreement; this behavior was reported among the !Kung and the Hadza. Finally, particularly among more nomadic groups, people may just move away from a leader they don't like. The active attempts to put down upstarts in many egalitarian societies prompts Christopher Boehm to suggest that dominance comes naturally to humans. Egalitarian societies work hard to reverse that tendency.3 The Mbuti provide an example of a society almost totally equal: "Neither in ritual, hunting, kinship nor band relations do they exhibit any discernible inequalities of rank or advantage."4 Their hunting bands have no leaders, and recognition of the achievement of one person is not accompanied by privilege of any sort. Economic resources such as food are communally shared, and even tools and weapons are frequently passed from person to person. Only within the family are rights and privileges differentiated.

Foraging societies with extensive sharing of resources are more readily labeled egalitarian as compared with some pastoral societies where households may vary considerably in the number of animals they own. Should we consider a pastoral society with unequal distribution of animals egalitarian? Here there is controversy. One important issue is whether unequal ownership persists through timeâ€”that is, inherited. If vagaries of weather, theft, and gifts of livestock to relatives make livestock ownership fluctuate over time, wealth differences may mostly be temporary. A second important issue is whether the inequalities in livestock ownership make any difference in the ease of acquiring other "goods," such as prestige and political power. If wealth in livestock is ephemeral and is not associated with differential access to prestige and power, then some anthropologists would characterize such pastoral societies as egalitarian.5 While some pastoral societies are egalitarian, most are not; in a worldwide crosscultural sample only about 20 percent of pastoralist societies lack slavery or social classes.6 And in a recent comparison of four pastoral societies, explicitly measuring transmission of

wealth from parents to children, children were very likely to be in higher wealth categories if their parents were.7 It is easy to imagine how an egalitarian society with some wealth differences, as opposed to one with no wealth differences, could become a rank or a class society. All you would need is a mechanism for retaining more wealth in some families over time.

# Rank Societies

Most societies with social *ranking* practice agriculture or herding, but not all agricultural or pastoral societies are ranked. Ranking is characterized by social groups with unequal access to prestige or status but *not* significantly unequal access to economic resources or power. Unequal access to prestige is often reflected in the position of chief, a rank which only some members of a specified group in the society can achieve.

Unusual among rank societies were the 19th-century Native Americans who lived along the northwestern coast of the United States and the southwestern coast of Canada; the Nimpkish, a Kwakiutl group, are an example.8 These societies were unusual because their economy was based on food collecting. But huge catches of salmonâ€”which were preserved for year-round consumptionâ€”enabled them to support fairly large and permanent villages. These societies were similar to food-producing societies in many ways, not just in their development of social ranking. Still, the principal means of proving one's high status was to give away wealth. The tribal chiefs celebrated solemn rites by grand feasts called *potlatches*, at which they gave gifts to every guest.9

In rank societies, the position of chief is at least partly hereditary. The criterion of superior rank in some Polynesian societies, for example, was genealogical. Usually the eldest son succeeded to the position of chief, and different kinship groups were differentially ranked according to their genealogical distance from the chiefly line. In rank societies, chiefs are often treated with deference by people of lower rank. For example, among the Trobriand Islanders of Melanesia, people of lower rank must keep their heads lower than a person of higher rank. So, when a chief is standing, commoners must bend low. When commoners have to walk past a chief who happens to be sitting, he may rise and they will bend. If the chief chooses to remain seated, they must crawl.10

Although there is no question that chiefs in a rank society enjoy special prestige, there is some controversy over whether they really do not also have material advantages. Chiefs may sometimes look as if they are substantially richer than commoners, for they may receive many gifts and have larger storehouses. In some instances, the chief may even be called the "owner" of the land. However, Marshall Sahlins maintains that the chief's storehouses only house temporary accumulations for feasts or other redistributions. And although the chief may be designated the "owner" of the land, others have the right to use the land. Furthermore, Sahlins suggests that the chief in a rank society lacks power because he usually cannot make people give him gifts or force them to work on communal projects. Often the chief can encourage production only by working furiously on his own cultivation.11

This picture of economic equality in rank societies has been questioned. Laura Betzig studied patterns of food sharing and labor on Ifaluk, a small atoll in the Western Carolines.12 Chiefly status is inherited geneaologically in the female line, although most chiefs are male. (In the chapter on sex and gender, we discuss why political leaders are usually male, even in societies structured around women.) As in other chiefly societies, Ifaluk chiefs are accorded deference. For example, during collective meals prepared by all the island women, chiefs were served first and were bowed to. The Ifaluk chiefs are said to control the fishing areas. Were the catches equitably distributed? Betzig measured the amount of fish each household got. All the commoners received an equal share, but the chiefs got extra fish; their households got twice as much per person as other households. Did the chiefs give away more later?

Theoretically, generosity is supposed to even things out, but Betzig found that the gifts from chiefs to other households did not equal the amount the chiefs received from others. Furthermore, although everyone gave to the chiefs, the chiefs gave mostly to their close relatives. On Ifaluk, the chiefs did not work harder than others; in fact, they worked less. Is this true in other societies conventionally considered to be rank societies? We do not know. However, we need to keep in mind that the chiefs in Ifaluk were not noticeably better off either. If they lived in palaces with servants, had elaborate meals, or were

dressed in fine clothes and jewelry, we would not need measures of food received or a special study to see if the chiefs had greater access to economic resources, because their wealth would be obvious. But rank societies may not have had as much economic equality as we used to think.

#### 17.4 Describe the characteristics of class societies.

**Class** A category of people who have about the same opportunity to obtain economic resources, power, and prestige.

# Class Societies

A social **class** is a category of people who all have about the same opportunity to obtain economic resources, power, and prestige. In class societies, groups of people are *stratified*, or divided into levels, according to their degree of access not only to prestige, as in rank societies, but also to wealth and power. Can an individual in a fully stratified society change his or her class affiliation? It depends on how strictly the society observes its class system. And class societies range in strictness from somewhat open systems, to virtually closed, or *caste*, systems.

### Open Class Systems

Class systems are called *open* if there is some possibility of moving from one class to another. Since the 1920s, there have been many studies of classes in towns and cities in the United States. Researchers have produced profiles of these different communitiesâ€”known variously as Yankee City, Middletown, Jonesville, and Old Cityâ€”all of which support the premise that the United States has distinguishable, though somewhat open, social classes. Both W. Lloyd Warner and Paul Lunt's Yankee City study13 and Robert and Helen Lynd's Middletown study14 concluded that the social status or prestige of a family is generally correlated with the occupation and wealth of the head of the family. Class systems are by no means confined to the United States. They are found in all nations of the modern world.

Although class status is not fully determined at birth in open class societies, there is a high probability that most people will stay close to the class into which they were born and will marry within that class. An important way classes perpetuate themselves is through

inheritance. The transfer of money through bequests accounts for a considerable amount of the wealth of the next generation. As we might expect, the importance of inheritance seems to increase at higher levels of wealth. For example, a majority of individuals on the Forbes list of the 400 wealthiest individuals in America inherited at least \$50 million each.15 But inheritance is much more than money and property that is passed on at death. Children of wealthier parents have better access to health care, higher quality food, better schools, and tutors and see more of the world. They learn the "manners" associated with the upper classes and are introduced to others who may help them later on. Other mechanisms of class perpetuation may be more subtle, but they are still powerful. In the United States, many institutions make it possible for an upper-class person to have little contact with other classes. They may live in remote or isolated houses with long driveways out of view protected by complex security. They socialize in private clubs, private resorts, and exclusive parties. Travel may be on private planes or yachts.16 Children go to private day and boarding schools that put upper-class children in close contact mostly with others of their class. Attending these schools makes it more likely that they will get into universities with higher prestige. Debutante balls and exclusive private parties ensure that young people meet the "right people." Thus, wealthier children are more likely to marry wealthier people when they grow up. Country clubs, exclusive city clubs, and service in particular charities continue the process of limited association. People of the same class also tend to live in the same neighborhoods. Before 1948, explicit restrictions kept certain groups out of particular neighborhoods, but after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled such discrimination unconstitutional, more subtle methods were developed. For instance, town or neighborhood zoning restrictions may prohibit multiple-family dwellings in a town or neighborhood and lots below a certain acreage.17 The ability to enact zoning restrictions is just a small part of the way the upper class exerts power. The upper class has more power. Their power comes not just from political contributions, but also from holding important positions in government, in corporations, as lobbyists, and in foundations. Knowing other important people helps maintain that power.18

In addition to differences in occupation, wealth, and prestige, social classes vary in many other ways, including religious affiliation, closeness to kin, ideas about childrearing, job satisfaction, leisure-time activities, style of clothes and furniture, and (as noted in the chapter on communication and language) even in styles of speech.19 People from each class tend to be more comfortable with those from the same class; they talk similarly and are more likely to have similar interests and tastes.

Class boundaries, though vague, have been established by custom and tradition; sometimes they have been reinforced by the enactment of laws. Many of our laws serve to protect property and thus tend to favor the upper and upper-middle classes. The poor, in contrast, seem to be disadvantaged in our legal system. The crimes the poor are most likely to commit are dealt with harshly by the courts, and poor people rarely have the money to secure effective legal counsel.

In open class systems, it is not always clear how many classes there are. In Stanley Barrett's study of "Paradise," Ontario, some people thought that there were only two classes in the past. One person said, "There was the hierarchy, and the rest of us." Another said that there were three classes: "The people with money, the in-between, and the ones who didn't have anything." Many said there were four: "The wealthy businessmen, the middle class, blue collar workers, and the guys that were just existing."20 A few insisted that there were five classes. With the breakdown of the old rigid class structure, there are more people in the middle.21

Degree of Openness Some class systems are more open than others; that is, it is easier in some societies to move from one class position to another. Social scientists typically compare the class of people with the class of their parent or parents to measure the degree of mobility. Although most people aspire to move up, mobility also includes moving down. Obtaining more education, particularly a university education, is one of the most effective ways to move upward in contemporary societies. For example, in the United States, individuals with a college bachelor's degree working full-time average 67 percent more income than those with only a high school diploma. And individuals with professional degrees earn on average 81 percent more than those with a bachelor's degree.22 And, individuals with higher degrees are much more likely to be employed full-time.23 In many countries, educational attainment predicts one's social class better than parents' occupation does.24

How do the United States and Canada compare with other countries in degree of class mobility? Canada, Finland, and Sweden have more mobility than the United States and Britain. Mexico and Peru have less mobility than the United States and Brazil, and Colombia considerably less.25

Class openness also varies over time. In "Paradise," Ontario, Barrett found that the rigid stratification system of the 1950s opened up considerably as new people moved into the community. No one disputed who belonged to the elite in the past. They were of British background, lived in the largest houses, had new cars, and vacationed in Florida. Moreover, they controlled all the leadership positions in the town. By the 1980s, though, the leaders came mostly from the middle and working classes.26

Degree of Inequality Degree of class mobility is related to degree of inequalityâ€”more unequal societies generally have less mobility from one class to another.27 However, the two are not exactly the same. For example, Canada has about as much mobility as Norway, but Canada has much more inequality than Norway.28 Degree of inequality can vary considerably over time. In the United States, inequality has fluctuated considerably from the 1900s to the present. Two of the highest periods of inequality were just before the 1929 stock market crash and just before the recession of 2007, when the top 10 percent had almost 50 percent of all the income in the country. The least inequality was in the mid-1970s, after the stock market declined by 42 percent. Then the top 10 percent controlled about 33 percent of the income. Except for declines during recessions after the 1970s, inequality has generally increasedâ€”the United States now has more inequality than any rich nation on earth.29

Change over time in the degree of inequality sometimes appears to have economic causes; for example, the 1929

crash made the wealthy less wealthy. But some of the change over time is due to shifts in public policy. During the New Deal of the 1930s, tax changes and work programs shifted more income to ordinary people; in the 1980s, tax cuts for the wealthy helped the rich get richer and they have continued to get richer.30

One way of measuring inequality is by the Gini coefficient, a number that ranges from a possible 0 score, where everyone has the same income, to 100, where one person has all the income and everyone else has nothing. Although neither 0 nor 100 actually occur, the coefficient gives us a way to compare inequality over time or countries. The spread of Gini coefficients shown in Figure 17.1 for selected countries ranges from a low of 25.8 for Norway and a high of 59.5 for Haiti. The Caribbean and Latin American region has the highest level of inequality than any world region.31 The United States has more inequality than countries in Europe and even more than Indonesia and India. But we have to keep in mind that inequality is relative. It is possible for a person at the bottom of a country's income level to still be better off than most people from another country. For example, India and the United States do not differ much in terms of income inequality, but the United States is much richer as a country. Most of the poor people in the United States actually have higher purchasing power than 97 percent of the people in India.32

#### Recognition of Class

Societies that have open class systems vary in the degree to which members of the society recognize that there are classes, albeit somewhat open classes. The United States is unusual in that, despite objective evidence of multiple social classes, many people deny their existence. The ideology that hard work and strong character can transform anyone into a success appears to be so powerful that it masks the realities of social inequality.33 When we were

![](_page_8_Figure_1.jpeg)

The countries are ordered by their Gini coefficients, a widely used measure of degree of income inequality. Hypothetically, a country where everyone has the same income would get a 0 score; a country where all the income goes to one person would get a score of 100. *Source:* These data are abstracted from the U.N. Human Development Report 2011. Table 3.

growing up, we were told that "anyone can be President of the United States." As "proof," people pointed to a few individuals who rose from humble beginnings. But consider the odds. How many presidents have come from poor families? How many were not European in background? How many were not Protestant? (And, how many were not male?) As of 2014, almost all of the presidents of the United States have been mainly European in ancestry, all but one have been Protestant, and all have been male. And only a handful came from humble beginnings. The paradox of an open class system is that, to move up in the social ladder, people seem to have to believe that it is possible to do so. However, it is one thing to believe in mobility; it is another thing to deny the existence of classes. Why might people need to deny that classes exist?

### Caste Systems

Some societies have classes (called castes) that are virtually closed. A **caste** is a ranked group in which membership is determined at birth, and marriage is restricted to members of one's own caste. The only way you can belong is by being born into the group; and because you cannot marry outside the group, your children cannot acquire another caste status either. In India, for example, there are several thousand hereditary castes. Although the precise ranking of these thousands of groups is not clear, there appear to be four main levels of hierarchy. The castes in India are often thought to be associated with different occupations, but that is not quite true. Most Indians live in rural areas and have agricultural occupations, but their castes vary widely.34 **Caste** A ranked group, often associated with a certain occupation, in which membership is determined at birth and marriage is restricted to members of one's own caste.

Castes may exist in conjunction with a more open class system. Indeed, in India today, members of a low caste who can get wage-paying jobs, chiefly those in urban areas, may improve their social standing in the same ways available to people in other class societies. In general, however, they still cannot marry someone in a higher caste, so the caste system is perpetuated.

Questions basic to all stratified societies, and particularly to a caste society, were posed by John Ruskin, a 19th-century British essayist: "Which of us . . . is to do the hard and dirty work for the restâ€”and for what pay? Who is to do the pleasant and clean work, and for what pay?"35 In India, those questions have been answered by the caste system, which mainly dictates how goods and services are exchanged, particularly in rural areas.36 Who is to do the hard and dirty work for the rest of society is clearly established: A large group of Untouchables forms the bottom of the hierarchy. Among the Untouchables are subcastes such as the Camars, or leatherworkers, and the Bhangis, who traditionally are sweepers. At the top of the hierarchy, performing the pleasant and clean work of priests, are the Brahmans. Between the two extremes are thousands of castes and subcastes.37 In a typical village, a potter makes clay drinking cups and large water vessels for the entire village population. In return, the principal landowner gives him a house site and supplies him twice yearly with grain. Some other castes owe the potter their services: The barber cuts his hair; the sweeper carries away his rubbish; the washer washes his clothes; the Brahman performs his children's weddings. The barber serves every caste in the village except the Untouchables; he, in turn, is served by half of the others. He has inherited the families he works for, along with his father's occupation. All castes help at harvest and at weddings for additional payment, which sometimes includes a money payment.

This description is, in fact, an idealized picture of the caste system of India. In reality, the system operates to the advantage of the principal landowning casteâ€”sometimes the Brahmans and sometimes other castes. Also, it is not carried on without some resentment; signs of hostility are shown toward the ruling caste by the Untouchables and other lower castes. The resentment does not appear to be against the caste system as such. Instead, the lower castes exhibit bitterness at their own low status and strive for greater equality. For instance, one of the Camars' traditional services is to remove dead cattle; in return, they can have the meat to eat and the hide to tan for their leatherworking. Because handling dead animals and eating beef are regarded as unclean acts, the Camars of one village refused to continue this service. Thus, they lost a source of free hides and food in a vain attempt to escape unclean status.

Since World War II, the economic basis of the caste system in India has been undermined somewhat by the growing practice of giving cash payment for services. For instance, the son of a barber may be a teacher during the week, earning a cash salary, and confine his haircutting to weekends. But he still remains in the barber caste (Nai) and must marry within that caste.

Perpetuation of the caste system is ensured by the power of those in the upper castes, who derive three main advantages from their position: economic, prestige, and sexual gains. The economic gain is the most immediately apparent. An ample supply of cheap labor and free services is maintained by the threat of sanctions. Lower-caste members may have their use of a house site withdrawn; they may be refused access to the village well or to common grazing land for animals; or they may be expelled from the village. Prestige is also maintained by the threat of sanctions; people in the higher castes expect deference and servility from those in the lower castes. The sexual gain is less apparent but equally real. The high-caste male has access to two groups of females, those of his own caste and those of lower castes. High-caste females are kept free of the "contaminating" touch of low-caste males because low-caste males are allowed access only to low-caste women. Moreover, the constant reminders of ritual uncleanness serve to keep those of the lower castes "in their place." People in higher castes do not accept water from Untouchables, sit next to them, or eat at the same table with them.

Japan also had a caste group within a class society. Now called *burakumin*, this group traditionally had occupations that were considered unclean.38 They were a hereditary, endogamous (in-marrying) group. Their occupations were traditionally those of farm laborer, leatherworker, and basket weaver; their standard of living was very low. The burakumin are physically indistinguishable from other Japanese.39 Despite that, the burakumin were considered a separate "race" by some for centuries.40 The Japanese government officially abolished discrimination against the burakumin in 1871, but the burakumin did not begin organizing to bring about change until the 20th century. Some conditions have changed. As of 1995, 73 percent of burakumin marriages were with non-burakumin and in public opinion polls, two-thirds of burakumin said that they had not encountered discrimination. However, some burakumin still live in segregated neighborhoods, where unemployment, crime, and alcoholism rates are high.41

In a considerable number of sub-Saharan African societies, some occupational specialties are only performed by certain castes. The specialties usually involve metalworking, pottery, woodworking, leatherworking, playing musical instruments, and praise-singing. There may be different castes for different specialties or one caste for many specialties. In some cases, the caste consists of people who traditionally hunted and gathered. In almost all cases, the specialists had to marry within their own group and their social position was inherited. These castes usually constituted only a small minority of the society's population and were not the lowest ranking groups in society. Only slaves had a lower rank. Some of the castes took on additional tasks, such as go-betweens for arranging marriages, messengers, and circumcisers. The caste vocational distinctions have weakened in recent times as people have become more educated.42

In Rwanda, long before the ethnic division arose between the Hutu and Tutsi (see discussion later in the ethnicity section), the Twa, who comprised less than 1 percent of the population, were subject to serious discrimination. Their bodies were viewed as dangerous and polluting and they were avoided whenever possible. For example, if a Twa were present while others were eating or drinking, separate utensils were reserved only for Twa. The Twa traditional occupations were foraging, making pottery, entertaining, and serving as torturers or executioners for the Rwandan king. Mutton was considered a Twa food and other Rwandans would not eat mutton.43

In the United States, African Americans used to have more of a caste-like status determined partly by the inherited characteristic of skin color. Until recently, some states had laws prohibiting an African American from marrying a European American. When interethnic marriage did occur, children of the union were often regarded as having lower status than European American children, even though they may have had blond hair and light skin. In the South, where treatment of African Americans as a caste was most apparent, European Americans refused to eat with African Americans or sit next to them at lunch counters, on buses, and in schools. Separate drinking fountains and toilets reinforced the idea of ritual uncleanness. The economic advantages and gains in prestige that European Americans enjoyed are well documented.44 In the following sections on slavery, racism, and inequality, we discuss the social status of African Americans in more detail.

### **Global Inequality**

hen people support themselves by what they collect and produce themselves, as most people did until a few thousand years ago, there wasn't that much difference in economic wealth. In fact, it is difficult to compare the standards of living of subsistence-level societies because we cannot translate what people have into market or monetary value. Only where people are at least partly involved in the world market economy can we measure the standard of living in monetary terms. Today, this comparison is possible for most of the world. Many people in most societies depend on buying and selling for a living; and the more people who depend on international exchange, the more possible it is to compare them in terms of standard economic indicators. We do not have such indicators for all the different societies in the world, but we do have them for many countries. Since goods and services cost different amounts in different places, economists have had to adjust to one standard (usually the U.S. dollar is used as a standard). So, for example, if a person in China can buy 2Â½ times the stuff that an American can for the same money equivalent, the per capita gross domestic product for China is adjusted upward by that amount. How do countries compare to each other and how has it changed over time?

Scholars estimate that the wealth gap between countries of the world has grown enormously since the Industrial Revolution In 1830 Britain and the Netherlands were the richest countries, but they were only three times richer than some of the poorest countries. (India and China were among the poorest countries then.) As of 2010, the ratio between the richest and poorest countries is about 100 to 1. Countries like India and China have improved their economic picture considerably, but overall, the gap between rich and poor countries continues to widen. Branko Milanovic compares the Industrial Revolution to the "Big Bang" of the

universe with the countries getting further apart.

If the world as a whole is seeing improvements in technology and economic development, why is the gap between the rich and poor countries increasing? Most theorists did not expect this to happen. Rather, they expected that with globalization, rich countries would invest in poorer countries, technology could be borrowed, and countries would specialize in what they do best. But although some of this happened in the past, for example between 1870 and 1914, this has not happened recently. In fact, rich nations invest more in rich nations. Money actually flows from poorer countries to the rich as the wealthiest in those countries invest abroad for security. Part of the explanation may be similar to why the rich within a society benefit most from new technology, at least initially. The rich are not only the most likely to be able to afford new technology, they also are the only ones who can afford to take the risks that it involves. The same may be true for nations. Those that already

have capital are more likely to take advantage of improvements in technology. In addition, the poorer countries generally have the highest rates of population growth, so income per capita can fall if population increases faster than the rate of economic development.

If it is true that the disparity between rich and poor countries has increased in recent years, it is also true that the world has seen improvement in some other respectsâ€”people are healthier, more educated, live longer, and can buy more goods and services. The United Nations has computed a human development index for many countries, combining measures of life expectancy, literacy, and a measure of per capita purchasing power. According to this index, almost all countries have improved between 1970 and 2010. A quarter of the countries have improved more than 65 percent. Much more will remain to be done if we are to achieve a more equal world.

#### Slavery

Slavery is difficult to define because slavery systems and the treatment of slaves varied enormously.45 A definition therefore needs to focus on what is common to slavery systems and to slaves. A common definition of **slaves** is that they are people who do not own their own labor, and as such they represent a class. We may associate slavery with a few well-known examples, such as ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome or the southern United States, but the practice of enslaving people has existed at some point in time in almost every part of the world at one time or another, in simpler as well as in more complex societies. Slaves are often obtained from other cultures directly; they are kidnapped, captured in war, or given as tribute. Or they may be obtained indirectly through barter or trade. Slaves have sometimes come from the same culture; people have become slaves to repay a debt, as punishment for a crime, or even because it was an alternative to poverty. The degree to which slaves can gain their freedom varies among slave societies.46 Sometimes slavery has been a closed class, or caste, system; sometimes it has been a relatively open class system. While the legal rights of slaves have also differed, all slave-owning societies have granted them some legal or customary rights.47

The slaves in ancient Greece were often conquered enemies. Because city-states were constantly conquering one another or rebelling against former conquerors, anyone could be enslaved. After the Trojan War, the transition of Hecuba from queen to slave was marked by her cry, "Count no one happy, however fortunate, before he dies."48 Nevertheless, Greek slaves were considered human beings, and they could even acquire some higher-class status along with freedom. Andromache, Hecuba's daughter-in-law, was taken as a slave and concubine by one of the Greek heroes. When his legal wife produced no children, Andromache's slave son became heir to his father's throne. Although slaves had no rights under law, once they were freed, either by the will of their master or by purchase, they and their descendants could become assimilated into the dominant group. In other words, slavery in Greece was not seen as the justified position of inferior people. It was regarded, rather, as an act of fateâ€”"the luck of the draw"â€”that relegated one to the lowest class in society.

Among the Nupe, a society in central Nigeria, slavery was of quite another type.49 The methods of obtaining slavesâ€”as part of the booty of warfare and, later, by purchase were similar to those of Europeans, but the position of the slaves was very different. Mistreatment was rare. Male slaves were given the same opportunities to earn money as other dependent males in the householdâ€”younger brothers, sons, or other relatives. A slave might be given a garden plot of his own to cultivate, or he might be given a commission if his master was a craftsman or a tradesman. Slaves could acquire property, wealth, and even slaves of their own. But all of a slave's belongings went to the master at the slave's death.

**Manumission**â€”the granting of freedom to slavesâ€”was built into the Nupe system. If a male slave could afford the marriage payment for a free woman, the children of the resulting marriage were free; the man himself, however, remained a slave. Marriage and concubinage were the easiest ways out of bondage for a slave woman. Once she had produced a child by her master, both she and the child had free status. The woman, however, was only figuratively free; if a concubine, she had to remain in that role. As might be expected, the family trees of the nobility and the wealthy were liberally grafted with branches descended from slave concubines.

The most fortunate slaves among the Nupe were the house slaves. They could rise to positions of power in the household as overseers and bailiffs, charged with law enforcement and judicial duties. (Recall the Old Testament story of Joseph, who was sold into slavery by his brothers. Joseph became a household slave of the pharaoh and rose to the position of second in the kingdom because he devised an ingenious system of taxation.) There was even a titled group of Nupe slaves, the Order of Court Slaves, who were trusted officers of the king and members of an elite. Slave status in general, though, placed one at the bottom of the social ladder. In the Nupe system, few slaves, mainly princes from their own societies, ever achieved membership in the titled group. Nupe slavery was abolished at the beginning of the 20th century.

In the United States, slavery originated as a means of obtaining cheap labor, but the slaves soon came to be regarded as deserving of their low status because of their alleged inherent inferiority. Because the slaves were from Africa and were dark-skinned, some European

Americans justified slavery and the belief in "black" people's inferiority by quoting scripture out of context ("They shall be hewers of wood and drawers of water."). Slaves could not marry or make any other contracts, nor could they own property. In addition, their children were also slaves, and the master had sexual rights over the female slaves. Because the status of slavery was determined by birth in the United States, slaves constituted a caste. During the days of slavery, therefore, the United States had both a caste and a class system. It is widely assumed that slavery occurred only in the southern United States, but slavery existed in the northern states as well, although not on as large a scale. New Jersey was the last northern state to legally give up slavery, around the time of the U.S. Civil War.50

Even after the abolition of slavery, as we have noted, some castelike elements remained. It is important to note that these castelike elements were not limited to the American South, where slavery had been practiced. For example, although Indiana was established as a "free" state in 1816, in its first constitution, "negros" did not have the right to vote, nor could they intermarry with "whites." In the constitution of 1851, Indiana did not allow "negros" to come into the state, nor did it allow the existing African American residents to attend public schools even though they had to pay school taxes.51 In Muncie, Indiana, in the first half of the 20th century, there was customary segregation in shows, restaurants, and parks. Not until the 1950s was the public swimming pool desegregated.<sup>52</sup>

As for why slavery may have developed in the first place, cross-cultural research is as yet inconclusive. We do know, however, that slavery is not an inevitable stage in economic development, contrary to what some have assumed. In other words, slavery is not found mainly in certain economies, such as those dependent on intensive agriculture. Unlike the United States until the Civil War, many societies with intensive agriculture did not develop any variety of slavery. Also, the hypothesis that slavery develops where available resources are plentiful but labor is scarce is not supported by the cross-cultural evidence. All we can say definitely is that slavery does not occur in developed or industrial economies; either it disappears or it was never present in them.53

## Racism and Inequality

**Racism** is the belief that some "races" are inferior to others. In a society composed of people with noticeably different physical features, such as differences in skin color, racism is almost invariably associated with social stratification. Those "races" considered inferior make up a larger proportion of the lower social classes or castes. Even in more open class systems, where individuals from all backgrounds can achieve higher status positions, individuals from groups deemed inferior may be subject to discrimination in housing or may be more likely to be searched or stopped by the police.

In some societies, such as the United States, the idea that humans are divided into "races" is taken so much for granted that people are asked for their "race" on the census. Most Americans probably assume that the classification of people into categories such as "white" or "black" reflects important biological categories. But that is not so. You may have noticed that we put "race" in quotes to reflect the fact that most anthropologists are now persuaded that the biological concept of "race" is not scientifically useful when applied to humans. To understand why, we will briefly discuss how the construct of race is used in biology.

#### Race as a Construct in Biology

Biological variation is not uniformly distributed in any species. While all members of a species can potentially interbreed with others, most matings take place within smaller groups or breeding populations. Through time, populations inhabiting different geographic regions will come to exhibit some differences in biological traits. When differences within a species become sufficiently noticeable, biologists may classify different populations into different *varieties*, or *races*. If the term **race** is understood to be just a shorthand or classificatory way that biologists describe slight population variants within a species, the concept of race would probably not be controversial as applied to humans. Humans have exhibited so much interbreeding that different populations are not clearly classifiable into

17.5 Discuss how racism and inequality are related.

**Racism** The belief, without scientific basis, that some "races" are inferior to others.

**Race** In biology, race refers to a subpopulation or variety of a species that differs somewhat in gene frequencies from other varieties of the species. Many anthropologists do not think that the concept of race is usefully applied to humans because humans do not fall into geographic populations that can be easily distinguished in terms of different sets of biological or physical traits. Thus, race in humans is largely a culturally assigned category.

discrete groups that can be defined in terms of the presence or absence of particular biological traits.54 The difficulty in employing racial classification is evident by comparing the number of "races" that classifiers come up with. The number of "racial" categories in humans has varied from as few as 3 to more than 37.55 If different classifiers come up with different "races," there obviously are no clear lines of difference. Perhaps this is because most adaptive biological traits show clines or gradual differences from one region to another.56 Skin color is a good example of clinal variation. In the area around Egypt, there is a gradient of skin color as one moves from north to south in the Nile Valley. Skin generally becomes darker closer to the equator (south) and lighter closer to the Mediterranean (north). But other adaptive traits may not have north-south clines, because the environmental predictors may be distributed differently. Nose shape varies with humidity, but clines in humidity do not particularly correspond to variation in latitude. So the gradient for skin color would not be the

It is an illusion that there are races. The diversity of human beings is so great and so complicated that it is impossible to classify the 5.8 billions of individuals into discrete "races."

same as the gradient for nose shape. Because adaptive traits tend to be clinally distributed, there is no line you could draw on a world map that would separate "white" from "black" people or "whites" from "Asians."<sup>57</sup>

Racial classification is problematic also because there is sometimes more physical, physiological, and genetic diversity *within* a single geographic group that might be called a "race" (e.g., Africans) than there is *between* supposed "racial" groups. Africans vary more among themselves than they do in comparison with people elsewhere.58 The genetic diversity within Africa is consistent with the fossil evidence that the African continent is where both early humans and modern humans emerged. This is as you may remember, parallel to linguistic diversityâ€”English developed in England, and there we find the most dialect diversity. Modern humans emerged first in Africa, so it is accurate to say that we are all African, and members of the "human race."

Analyses of all human populations have demonstrated that 93â€“95% of genetic variation is due to individual differences within populations, while only 3â€“5% of genetic variation is due to differences between major human population groups.<sup>59</sup>

#### Race as a Social Category

If physical anthropologists tell us that "race" is not a meaningful construct to apply to humans, how come so many people "see" different races? Jonathan Marks points out that even children can readily sort things into categories, such as putting assorted size blocks into a "large" pile and a "small" pile. When they do this, they will mostly agree with other children about which are largest and which are smallest. But that doesn't mean that there are two types of blocks in the worldâ€”large and small. People find it easy to sort by skin color, but that will put people from India, who can be quite dark in skin color, with some people from Africa.60

Racial classifications are social categories to which individuals are assigned, by themselves and others, to separate "our" group from others. We have seen that people tend to be *ethnocentric,* to view their culture as better than other cultures. Racial classifications may reflect the same tendency to divide "us" from "them," except that the divisions are supposedly based on biological differences.61 The "them" are almost always viewed as inferior to "us."

We know that racial classifications have often been, and still are, used by certain groups to justify discrimination, exploitation, or genocide. The "Aryan race" was supposed to be the group of blond-haired, blue-eyed, white-skinned people whom Adolf Hitler wanted to dominate the world, to which end he and others attempted to destroy as many members of the Jewish "race" as they could. (An estimated 6 million Jews and others were murdered in what is now called the Holocaust.<sup>62</sup>) But who were the Aryans? Technically, Aryans are any people, including the German-speaking Jews in Hitler's Germany, who speak one of the Indo-European languages. The Indo-European languages include such disparate modern tongues as Greek, Spanish, Hindi, Polish, French, Icelandic, German, Gaelic, and English. And many Aryans speaking these languages have neither blond hair nor blue eyes. Similarly, all kinds of people may be Jews, whether or not they descend from

#### **Unequal in Death: African Americans Compared with European Americans**

veryone dies of something. Yet, if you consider cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in the United States, it turns out that after controlling for the effects of age and gender, African Americans die more often from that disease than European Americans. The same kind of disparity occurs also with almost every other major cause of deathâ€”cancer, cirrhosis of the liver. kidney disease, diabetes, injuries, infant mortality, and homicide. Medical anthropologists and health policy researchers want to know why. Without such understanding, it is hard to know how to reduce the disparity.

One reason may be subtle discrimination by the medical profession itself. For example, a European American with chest pain in the United States is more likely than an African American to be given an angiogram, an expensive medical procedure that looks for deficits in blood flow through the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart. And even if coronary heart disease is detected by an angiogram, an African American is less likely to receive bypass surgery. Thus, the death rate from cardiovascular disease may be higher for African Americans than for European Americans because of unequal medical care. Seeing a patient physically appears to make a difference. When heart specialists reviewed cases to make decisions about subsequent treatment after catheterization, recommendations did not differ by "race" when the doctors did not know the "race" of the patient.

Yet, although some difference in mortality may be due to disparity in medical treatment, this could only be part of the picture. African Americans may be more prone to cardiovascular disease because they are about twice as likely as European Americans to have high rates of hypertension (high blood pressure). But, why the disparity in hypertension? There is little reason to think that genetic influences are at play. First, there are very large differences in hypertension among populations of African ancestry. In one comparative study of hypertension, African Americans had much higher blood pressure than Africans in Nigeria and Cameroon, even in urban areas. People with African ancestry in the Caribbean were in the middle of the range. Lifestyle differences were also vast-the West Africans had plenty of exercise, were lean, and ate low-fat and low-salt diets. Any possible difference in genes would seem to be insignificant. A theory that has become popular suggests that enslaved individuals who could retain salt would have been most likely to survive the terrible conditions of slavery and slave voyages. If this theory were correct, it might suggest why African Americans have higher blood pressure than other people of African descent. But there is little evidence to support this theory. Critics suggest that salt-depleting diseases were not the leading causes of death in the slave voyages; tuberculosis and violence were more frequent causes of death. Furthermore, the slave ship theory would predict little genetic diversity in African American populations with respect to hypertension, but in fact there is great diversity.

Hypertension could be related also to differences in lifestyle and wealth. As we noted in the section on racism and inequality, African Americans in the United States are disproportionately poorer. Study after study has noted that healthier lifestyle habits are generally correlated with higher positions on the socioeconomic ladder. Moreover, individuals from higher social positions are more likely to have health insurance and access to care in superior hospitals. But even after correcting for factors such as obesity, physical activity, and social class, the health differential persistsâ€”African Americans still have a much higher incidence of hypertension than European Americans.

William Dressler suggests that stress is another possible cause of higher rates of hypertension. Despite increased economic mobility in recent years, African Americans are still subject to prejudice and may consequently have more stress even if they have higher income. Stress is related to higher blood pressure. In a color-conscious society, a very darkskinned individual walking in a wealthy neighborhood may be thought not to live there and may be stopped by the police. If Dressler is correct, darkerskinned African Americans who have objective indicators of higher status should have much higher blood pressure than would be expected from their relative education, age, body mass, or social class alone. And that seems to be true. Racism may affect health.

Sources: Smedley et al. 2003, 3; Geiger 2003; Dressler 1993; Cooper et al. 1999, 56-63; Dressler et al. 2005; Hoberman 2012.

the ancient Near Eastern population that spoke the Hebrew language. There are lightskinned Danish Jews and darker Jewish Arabs. One of the most orthodox Jewish groups in the United States is based in New York City and is composed entirely of African Americans.

The arbitrary and social basis of most racial classifications becomes apparent when you compare how they differ from one place to another. Consider, for example, what used to be thought about the "races" in South Africa. Under apartheid, which was a system of racial segregation and discrimination, someone with mixed "white" and "black" ancestry was considered "colored." However, when important people of African ancestry (from other countries) would visit South Africa, they were often considered "white." Chinese were considered "Asian"; but the Japanese, who were important economically to South Africa, were considered "white."63 In some parts of the United States, laws against interracial marriage continued in force through the 1960s. You would be considered a "negro" if you had an eighth or more "negro" ancestry (if one or more of your eight grandparents were "negro").64 In some states, an even smaller proportion made you "negro." Some refer to this concept as the "one-drop" ruleâ€”just a tiny bit of "negro" (now called "black") ancestry was sufficient to determine your "racial" classification.65 So only a small amount of "negro" ancestry made a person "negro." But a small amount of "white" ancestry did not make a person "white." Biologically speaking, this makes no sense, but socially it was another story.66

In much of Latin America and the Caribbean, the reverse rule is the case. A small amount of European blood can make you "white." When people from Dominica, Haiti, or Cuba come to the United States, they often find that their "race" has changed. They might have been considered "white" at home, but they are considered "black" in the United States. In contrast to the United States, with a two-part division of "white" and "black," concepts of race in Latin America are on more of a continuum from light to dark, with important middle positions (such as "mestizo"). Wealth makes a difference tooâ€”if you are dark-skinned, but wealthy, you will tend to be considered "whiter."67

If people of different "races" are viewed as inferior, they are more likely going to end up on the lower rungs of the social ladder in a socially stratified society. Discrimination will keep them out of the better-paying or higher-status jobs and in neighborhoods that are poorer with underperforming schools. One recent study sent rÃ©sumÃ©s for jobs with randomly assigned "white" sounding names or "black" sounding names.68 The "white" rÃ©sumÃ© yielded many more callbacks, equivalent to eight more years of experience. As the box "Unequal in Death" shows, people of different "races" also suffer from differential access to health care and have more health problems.

# Ethnicity and Inequality

If "race" is not a scientifically useful category because people cannot be clearly divided into different "racial" categories based on sets of physical traits, then racial classifications such as "black" and "white" in the United States might better be described as *ethnic* classifications. How else can we account for the following facts? Groups that are thought of as belonging to the same "race" now in the United States were earlier thought of as belonging to inferior "races." For example, in the latter half of the 19th century, newspapers would often talk about the new immigrants from Ireland as belonging to the Irish "race." At the turn of the century, Italians, with their "swarthy" skin were considered another "race." Before World War II, Jews were thought of as a separate "racial" group, and only became "white" afterward.69 It is hard to escape the idea that changes in "racial" classification occurred as the Irish, Italians, Jews, and other immigrant groups became more accepted by the majority in the United States.70

It is apparent that *ethnic groups* and *ethnic identities* emerge as part of a social and political process. The process of defining **ethnicity** usually involves a group of people emphasizing common origins and language, shared history, and selected cultural differences such as a difference in religion. Those doing the defining can be outside or inside the ethnic group. Outsiders and insiders often perceive ethnic groups differently. In a country with one large core majority group, often the majority group doesn't think of

17.6 Explain the relationship between ethnicity and inequality.

Because different groups are doing the perceiving, ethnic identities often vary with whether one is inside or outside the group.

itself as an ethnic group. Rather, they consider only the minority groups to have ethnic identities. For example, in the United States, it is not common for the majority to call themselves European Americans, but other groups may be called African Americans, Asian Americans, or Native Americans. The minority groups, on the other hand, may also have different named identities.71 Asian Americans may identify themselves more specifically as Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Chinese Americans, or Hmong. The majority population often uses derogatory names to identify people who are different. The majority may also tend to lump people of diverse ethnicities together. Naming a group establishes a boundary between it and other ethnic groups.72

Ethnic differences can sometimes arise from class differences. Rwanda is a good case in point. By the end of the 19th century, Rwandans were part of a kingdom with significant class distinctions, but the distinctions between Hutu and Tutsi, so important in recent times, were not very important or clear.73 Cattle were an important form of wealth and, although many people known as Tutsi were cattle herders and many known as Hutu were agriculturalists, many Tutsi and Hutu were both. If Hutu acquired wealth and intermarried with Tutsi, they could move up in rank. A Tutsi could lose cattle and turn to cultivation.74 Colonialism did not create differentiation between Tutsi and Hutu, but it did accentuate it. For example, the Belgian administration tried to reinforce the power of the "natural rulers" (the Tutsi), and they issued identity cards in the 1930s to distinguish Tutsi, Hutu, and Twa (the Twa were discussed earlier in the caste section). During the

colonial period, the idea developed that the three groups were biologically different from each other. It was commonly thought that the taller Tutsi were different people who originally conquered the others.75

When the Hutu united to demand more of the rewards of their labor in 1959, the king and many of the Tutsi ruling elite were driven out of the country. The Hutu then established a republican form of government and declared independence from Belgium in 1962. In 1990, Tutsi rebels invaded from Uganda, and attempts were made to negotiate a multiparty government. However, civil war continued, and in 1994 alone, over a million people, mostly Tutsi, were killed. Almost 2 million refugees, mostly Hutu, fled to Zaire as the Tutsi-led rebels established a new government.76 In the intervening years, the Rwandan government has made progress in bringing home the refugees, bringing those who committed genocide to trial, and integrating different groups into the government.77

Ethnic identity may be manipulated, by insiders and by outsiders, in different situations. A particularly repressive regime that emphasizes nationalism and loyalty to the state may not only suppress the assertiveness of ethnic claims; it may also act to minimize communication among people who might otherwise embrace the same ethnic identity.78 More democratic regimes may allow more expression of difference and celebrate ethnic difference. However, manipulation of ethnicity does not come just from the top. It may be to the advantage of minority groups to lobby for more equal treatment as a larger entity, such as Asian American, rather than as Japanese, Chinese, Hmong, Filipino, or Korean American. Similarly, even though there are hundreds of Native American groups, originally speaking different languages, there may be political advantages for all if they are treated as Native Americans.

In many multiethnic societies, ethnicity and diversity are things to be proud of and celebrated. Shared ethnic identity often makes people feel comfortable with similar people and gives them a strong sense of belonging. Still, ethnic differences in multiethnic societies are usually associated with inequities in wealth, power, and prestige. In other words, ethnicity is part of the system of *stratification*.

Although some people believe that inequities are deserved, the origins of ethnic stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination usually follow from historical and political events that give some groups dominance over others. For example, even though there were many early stories of help given by native peoples to the English settlers in the 17th century in the land now known as North America, the English were the invaders, and negative stereotypes about native peoples developed to justify taking their land and their lives. Referring to the negative stereotypes of Native Americans that developed, J. Milton Yinger said, "One would almost think that it had been the Indian who had invaded Europe, driven back the inhabitants, cut their population to one-third of its original size, unilaterally changed treaties, and brought the dubious glories of firewater and firearms."79

Similarly, as we noted in the section on slavery, African slaves were initially acquired as cheap labor, but inhumane treatment of slaves was justified by beliefs about their inferiority. Unfortunately, stereotypes can become self-fulfilling prophesies, especially if those discriminated against come to believe the stereotypes. It is easy to see how this can happen. If there is a widespread belief that a group is inferior, and that group is given inferior schools and little chance for improvement or little chance for a good job, the members of that group may acquire few skills and not try hard. The result is often a vicious cycle.80

And yet, the picture is not all bleak. Change has occurred. The ethnic identity a minority group forges can help promote political activism, such as the nonviolent civil rights movement in the United States in the 1960s. That activism, helped by some people in the more advantaged groups, helped break down many of the legal barriers and segregationist practices that reinforced inequality.

The traditional barriers in the United States have mostly been lifted in recent years, but the "color line" has not disappeared. African Americans are found in all social classes, but they remain underrepresented in the wealthiest group and overrepresented at the bottom. Discrimination may be lessened, but it is still not gone. Thus, African Americans may have to be better than others to get promoted, or it may be assumed that they got ahead just because they were African American and were hired because of affirmative action programs. European Americans often expect African Americans to be "ambassadors," to be called on mainly for knowledge about how to handle situations involving other African Americans. African Americans may work with others, but they usually go home to African American neighborhoods. Or they may live in mixed neighborhoods and experience considerable isolation. Few African Americans can completely avoid the anguish of racism.81

# The Emergence of Stratification

Anthropologists are not certain why social stratification developed. Nevertheless, they are reasonably sure that higher levels of stratification emerged relatively recently in human history. Archaeological sites dating before about 8,000 years ago do not show extensive evidence of inequality. Houses do not appear to vary much in size or content, and different communities of the same culture are similar in size and otherwise. Signs of inequality appear first in the Near East, about 2,000 years after agriculture emerged in that region. Inequality in burial suggests inequality in life. Particularly telling are unequal child burials. It is unlikely that children could achieve high status by their own achievements. So, when archaeologists find statues and ornaments only in some children's tombs, as at the 7,500-year-old site of Tell es-Sawwan in Iraq,82 the grave goods suggest that those children belonged to a higher-ranking family or a higher class.

Another indication that stratification is a relatively recent development in human history is the fact that certain cultural features associated with stratification also developed relatively recently. For example, most societies that depend primarily on agriculture or

17.7 Discuss the emergence of stratification. herding have social classes.83 Agriculture and herding developed within the past 10,000 years, so we may assume that most food collectors in the distant past lacked social classes. Other recently developed cultural features associated with class stratification include fixed settlements, political integration beyond the community level, the use of money as a medium of exchange, and the presence of at least some full-time specialization.84

In 1966, the comparative sociologist Gerhard Lenski suggested that the trend toward increasing inequality since 8,000 years ago was reversing. He argued that inequalities of power and privilege in industrial societiesâ€”measured in terms of the concentration of political power and the distribution of incomeâ€”are less pronounced than inequalities in complex preindustrial societies. Technology in industrialized societies is so complex, he suggested, that those in power are compelled to delegate some authority to subordinates if the system is to work. In addition, a decline in the birth rate in industrialized societies, coupled with the need for skilled labor, has pushed the average wage of workers far above the subsistence level, resulting in greater equality in the distribution of income. Finally, Lenski also suggested that the spread of the democratic ideology, and particularly its acceptance by elites, has significantly broadened the political power of the lower classes.85 A few studies have tested and supported Lenski's hypothesis that inequality has decreased with industrialization. In general, highly industrialized nations exhibit a lower level of inequality than nations that are only somewhat industrialized.86 But, as we have seen, even the most industrialized societies may still have an enormous degree of inequality.

Why did social stratification develop in the first place? Some stress the importance of increased productivity resulting in surpluses.87 Others stress the degree to which wealth can be transmitted across generations.88 With regard to surpluses, Sahlins suggested that surpluses would result in greater scope and complexity of the distribution system, enhancing the status of chiefs as redistributing agents. Gradually, this would give the chiefs more control over resources and ultimately more power.89 Lenski, too, argued that production of a surplus is the stimulus in the development of stratification, but he focused primarily on the conflict that arises over control of that surplus. Lenski concluded that the distribution of the surplus will be determined on the basis of power. Thus, inequalities in power promote unequal access to economic resources and simultaneously give rise to inequalities in privilege and prestige.90 A broader argument is that a surplus may lead to some advantages of one subgroup over another, such as more people to support a stronger military force, or more knowledge that could lead to the development of specialized, productive technology.91

The "surplus" theories of Sahlins and Lenski do not really address why people would produce surpluses or why redistributors or leaders will want, or be able, to acquire greater control over resources. Sahlins later amended his theory to suggest the reverseâ€”that leaders may encourage the development of a surplus to enhance their prestige.92 But even if that were so, prestige enhancement is not the same as wealth enhancement. After all, the redistributors or leaders in many rank societies do not have greater wealth than others, and custom seems to keep things that way. One suggestion is that, as long as followers have mobility, they can vote with their feet by moving away from leaders they do not like. But when people start to make more permanent "investments" in land or technology (e.g., irrigation systems or weirs for fishing), they are more likely to put up with a leader's aggrandizement in exchange for protection.93 Another suggestion is that access to economic resources becomes unequal only when there is population pressure on resources in rank or chiefdom societies.94 Such pressure may be what induces redistributors to try to keep more land and other resources for themselves and their families.

Trying to keep resources and ability to keep these resources are two different things. Recently, some scholars have estimated the amount of transmission of resources, including wealth, across generations in 21 societies differing in subsistence. In those societies, horticulturalists and foragers had much less transmission of wealth to the next generation compared to pastoralists and intensive agriculturalists. The researchers noted that the ability to consistently transmit resources to children could be a key to the emergence of inequalityâ€”indeed, wealth transmission is a good predictor of inequality.95 The ability to transmit advantages to offspring generation after generation is essential to stratification. If resources are constantly changing, there is no inherent value of transmitting parcels of land to children. If there aren't enough people to help you defend a valuable parcel, there is no point trying to exclude others. It is only when land begins to have permanent value and a family or kin group can defend it against others that such a group can develop more permanent wealth. Land scarcity and population pressure may also push toward exclusion as people invest in technology to make their land more productive; at the same time, the larger settlements and higher densities of people increase the possibility of having military support.

C. K. Meek offered an example of how population pressure in northern Nigeria may have led to economic stratification. At one time, a tribal member could obtain the right to use land by asking permission of the chief and presenting him with a token gift in recognition of his higher status. But, by 1921, the reduction in the amount of available land had led to a system under which applicants offered the chief large payments for scarce land. As a result of these payments, farms came to be regarded as private property, and differential access to such property became institutionalized.96

Future research by archaeologists, sociologists, historians, and anthropologists should provide more understanding of the emergence of social stratification in human societies and how and why it may vary in degree.

# Summary and Review

### Variation in Degree of Social Inequality

17.1 Discuss the concepts relating to the variation in degree of social inequality.

- â€¢ Societies vary in the extent to which social groups, as well as individuals, have unequal access to three types of advantages: (1) wealth or economic resources, (2) power, and (3) prestige.
- â€¢ Economic resources are things that have value in a culture and include land, technology, goods, and money. Power is influence based on the threat of force and is generally related to unequal access to resources. Prestige involves according someone or some group particular respect or honor.
- â€¢ The three types of society reflect the degree to which different social groups have unequal access to advantages: egalitarian, rank, and class societies.

How do anthropologists typically distinguish variation in social stratification?

### Egalitarian Societies

17.2 Describe the characteristics of egalitarian societies.

â€¢ Egalitarian societies contain no social groups with greater or lesser access to economic resources, power, or prestige; they can be found among forager and horticultural societies.

- â€¢ In an egalitarian society, some people may be better hunters or more skilled artists than others, but there is still equal access to status positions for people of the same ability, so society is not socially stratified.
- â€¢ Any prestige gained by one is neither transferable nor inheritable, and there are no groups with appreciably more influence over time. Egalitarian groups depend heavily on sharing, which ensures equal access to economic resources despite differences in acquired prestige.

How can people in an egalitarian society achieve status?

### Rank Societies

17.3 Describe the characteristics of rank societies.

- â€¢ Rank societies do not have very unequal access to economic resources or to power, but they do contain social groups with unequal access to prestige, often reflected in the position of chief, a rank which only some members of a specified group in the society can achieve.
- â€¢ Most societies with social ranking practice agriculture or herding, but not all agricultural or pastoral societies are ranked.

â€¢ Although chiefs in a rank society enjoy special prestige, there is some controversy over whether they also have material advantages or increased power.

What are the different anthropological ideas about what advantages chiefs in a rank society actually have?

## Class Societies

17.4 Describe the characteristics of class societies.

- â€¢ Class systems are found in all countries of the modern world. In class societies, groups of people are stratified according to their degree of access to prestige, economic resources, and power.
- â€¢ The potential for an individual to change class affiliation varies among class societies. Open class systems allow some possibility of moving from one class to another. Societies with more inequality generally have less mobility from one class to another.
- â€¢ Classes perpetuate themselves through inheritance, which becomes increasingly important at higher levels of wealth. Other mechanisms of class perpetuation include limited contact between classes and land zoning restrictions.
- â€¢ Classes vary in terms of religious affiliation, closeness to kin, ideas about childrearing, job satisfaction, leisure-time activities, style of clothes and furniture, and styles of speech.
- â€¢ Societies that have open class systems vary in the degree to which members of the society recognize that there are classes.
- â€¢ Some societies have virtually closed classes called castes. A caste is a ranked group into which one is born and in which marriage is restricted to members of one's own caste.
- â€¢ Slaves are people who do not own their own labor and, as such, represent a class. Practices of enslaving people have existed in almost every part of the world at some point, in simple and in complex societies. All slaveowning societies have granted slaves some type of rights.

In what ways do slavery systems differ? Why is slavery hard to define?

## Racism and Inequality

17.5 Discuss how racism and inequality are related.

â€¢ Racism is the belief that some "races" are inferior to others. Racism is almost invariably associated with

social stratification. "Races" make up a larger proportion of lower social classes or castes and can be discriminated against even in open-class systems.

- â€¢ Biologists use "race" as a shorthand to describe differences within a species that become sufficiently noticeable after populations become separated and develop some distinctive traits. Most anthropologists now agree that the biological concept of "race" is not usefully applied to humans. First, humans have had considerable interbreeding across geographical regions. Second, adaptive traits tend to be clinally distributed, so no clear geographic line separates groups.
- â€¢ Racial classification is problematic because there can be more physical, physiological, and genetic diversity *within* a single geographic "racial" group than there is *between* supposed "racial" groups.
- â€¢ Racial classifications are social categories to which individuals are assigned to separate one's own group from others based on biological differences. People tend to be ethnocentric, to view their culture as better than other cultures, and racial classifications operate in similar ways.

Why do most anthropologists say that "race" is not a useful scientific construct as applied to humans?

## Ethnicity and Inequality

17.6 Explain the relationship between ethnicity and inequality.

- â€¢ Racial classifications might better be described as ethnic classifications. The process of defining **ethnicity** usually involves a group of people, either outside or inside the ethnic group, emphasizing common origins and language, shared history, and cultural differences.
- â€¢ In a country with one large core majority group, the majority group often doesn't think of itself as an ethnic group but considers only the minority groups to have ethnic identities.
- â€¢ The majority population may tend to lump people of diverse ethnicities together whereas those in minority groups may identify themselves more specifically.
- â€¢ Shared ethnic identity often makes people feel comfortable with similar people and provides a strong sense of belonging. Still, ethnic differences in multiethnic societies are usually associated with inequities in wealth, power, and prestige and are part of the system of stratification.

â€¢ The origins of ethnic stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination usually follow from historical and political events that give some groups dominance over others.

What does it mean to describe ethnicity as a process?

### The Emergence of Stratification

17.7 Discuss the emergence of stratification.

â€¢ Substantial inequality generally appears only within permanent communities, centralized political systems, and intensive agriculture, cultural features that began to appear in the world only in the last 10,000 years. Before that time, most societies were probably egalitarian. However, the increase in inequality may have lessened somewhat with industrialization.

- â€¢ Other cultural features associated with stratification include social classes, fixed settlements, political integration beyond the community level, the use of money as a medium of exchange, and the presence of at least some full-time specialization.
- â€¢ In the world today, egalitarian societies have all but disappeared because of the global spread of commercial exchange and the voluntary or involuntary incorporation of many diverse people into large, centralized political systems.
- â€¢ Stratification may be related to the accumulation of surpluses and conflicts over control of those surpluses, the ability of a group to transmit advantages to offspring generation after generation, or to population pressure in rank or chiefdom societies.

What are some key theories regarding the emergence of stratification?

# Think on it

- 1. What might be some of the social consequences of large differences in wealth in a society? Explain your reasoning.
- 2. Is an industrial or a developed economy incompatible with a more egalitarian distribution of resources? Why or why not?
- 3. In a multiethnic society, does strong ethnic identity help or hinder social equality? Explain your answer.
- 4. We have pointed out that anthropologists believe that "race" is scientifically meaningless as applied to humansâ€”if so, why is classification by race present in many multiethnic societies?
