# **24 Areas and Dimensions of Social Change in India**

Social change has occurred in all societies and in all periods, but the rate and direction of social change diff ers from society to society. In one society the rate is rapid, while in another it is slow. In some societies change leads to deterioration, while in others it leads to improvement. In a word, social change may take place in any direction—deterioration, progress, or cyclical.

Social change refers to the changes in the structure and functions of social institutions such as family, religion, property, education, economy, and polity. It also refers to changes in role, relations between persons, persons and groups, and between groups and in the principles of resource allocation. It may also be noted that when we talk of social change, we have in mind a particular period, for example, social change in post-independent India. It may also be kept in mind that social change implies displacement of the old by the new or the old and the new may coexist.

## **SOURCES OF SOCIAL CHANGE IN INDIA**

Social change in India has been brought about by numerous factors. Although it is diffi cult to enumerate all the factors, the important ones are westernization, planning, legislation, education, and industrialization accompanied by urbanization.

**Westernization:** India has been under the British rule for about two centuries. During this period numerous changes took place in the Indian society and culture through the process of westernization of education, living standards, life values, and social interaction. Th e ideas of liberalism and democracy were the consequence of western education.

**Planning**: Th e free India adopted the system of planning to bring about the social and economic development of the country. Numerous social and economic laws were enacted in the fi elds of social

and economic reforms. Th e system of production and distribution was redesigned, and eff orts were made to increase productivity. Educational opportunities were expanded, and special benefi ts were conferred to the disadvantaged groups of the Indian society for their amelioration. It is however a moot question as to what extent planning has been successful to direct the cause of social change in the direction of social justice, economic equality, national unity, and removal of tensions and confl icts.

**Legalisation**: An important source of social change is legislation. Th e most important instrument in this direction is the Indian constitution adopted and enacted by the people on the twenty-sixth day of November 1949 and promulgated on 26 January 1950. Th e acceptance of the principles of equality, freedom, justice, etc., is a revolutionary step in the background of social structure on the eve of independence. Th ereafter, a host of social legislations are enacted for the welfare of workers, women, and the downtrodden to facilitate social and economic development.

**Education**: Th e importance of education in any society cannot but be overemphasized. Illiteracy is the greatest cause for concern for a nation. Education not only is a process of transmission of social values, but is itself their creator. It emphasizes values much as rationality, scientifi c thinking, and inquisitive mentality. Th e new generation, after imbibing these values, tends to question the existing pattern, the prevalent arrangements and institutions, thus creating tensions and confl icts eventually leading to social change. Further, education is a continuation of socialization process started in the family and as such it is also a source of social stability.

**Industrial urbanization:** Industrialization and urbanization began in India with western colonialism, and it was held that modem technology would substantially change the Indian society. Industrialization led to the emergence of industrial centres and urban settlements which caused migration of people from rural areas to cities and in consequence the change in their mode of living, habits, and attributes. Th e family relations were aff ected thereby. Urbanization led to interaction between persons of diff ering religions and caste background which lessened social distance and aff ected the caste character of the Indian society. Th ere was reallocation of roles irrespective of caste determinations. Th e growth of the rapid means of transport and communication brought the rural and urban dwellers nearer to each other, thereby changing the rural social norms and values.

Th e above are some of the major sources of social change in India. However, the list is by no means exhaustive. It is only indicative of a variety of sources producing change.

## **AREAS AND DIMENSIONS OF SOCIAL CHANGE IN INDIA**

Social changes may be classifi ed as modifi cations or replacements. It may be modifi cation of physical goods or social relationships. For example, the form of our breakfast has changed from home cooked to fast food. Although we eat the same basic materials such as wheat, eggs, corn, their form is changed. Ready-to-eat cornfl akes, breads, and burgers are substituted for the form in which these same materials were consumed in yester years. Th ere may also be modifi cation of social relationships. Th e old authoritarian family has become the small equalitarian family; the one-room school has become a multi-storeyed, centralized school. Our ideas about women's rights, social obligations and religion stand modifi ed today.

Change may also take the form of replacement. Horses have been replaced by automobiles. Th e old ideas have been replaced by new ideas. Th e germ theory has replaced the older views of the cause of disease. Democracy has replaced aristocracy.

Th e major fi elds where changes have taken place in post- independent India are the following:

**I. Family:** Family is the primary social institution and takes precedence over all other institutions. Th e following changes have come about in its structure and functions:

**(i)** Th ere is disintegration of the joint family system. Many of family rituals at the time of birth, marriage, and death are no longer observed.

**(ii)** Th e women have come out of the four walls and sought jobs in offi ces and factories, which has changed the form of husband –wife relationships and aff ected the family structure and functions. Th e present family is a nuclear family.

**(iii)** Th e women have ceased to be slaves of their husbands and claim equal rights and facilities within the house.

**(iv)** Love marriage, integrate marriages, and late marriages are another development in the Indian society.

**(v)** Th e number of divorces has increased while the infl uence of religion has decreased.

**(vi)** Th e family has lost its socializing role. It is no longer the cradle social virtues. Th e children have developed an attitude of independence and freedom. Th ey do not care much for family traditions and do no hesitate quitting the parents on slight provocation.

**(vii)** Th e loosening of sex relations has marred the purity of married life. Th e family is now looked on as a rest-house rather than a bond of lifelong union. Family relations have also lost their sanctity, and family disputes and tensions are on the increase.

Also see the chapters on Family (Chapter 7) and Joint Family System (Chapter 20)

**II. Economy:** In the economic fi eld, the following changes can be seen:

**(i)** Village industries have suff ered eclipse. New types of economic organizations such as factories, agencies, stores, and banks have come up. Economy is no longer self-suffi cient; it has acquired a global character.

**(ii)** Th ere has occurred concentration of industries into huge closed, packed cities, which have caused the problems of congestion and pollution.

**(iii)** Due to urbanization, the outgrowth of economic development has aff ected primary contacts. Th e city dwellers do not personally know each other. Institutional norms have lost their control in regulating or controlling social behaviour. Socially, the city dwellers are strangers in the midst of numerous institutional organizations.

**(iv)** Industrialization has given birth to capitalism and its attendant evils. Along with it trade union movement has taken its roots.

**(v)** Division of labour and specialization are the other off shoots of technology.

**(vi)** A new class called middle class has taken birth.

**(vii)** We have more amenities of life and enjoy a higher standard of living than our forefathers.

**(viii)** Economic depression, unemployment, industrial disputes, accidents, and diseases are the other aspects of the present Indian economy.

**III. Polity:** Th e polity has been aff ected in the following ways:

**(i)** A large number of functions have been transferred from the family to the state. Th e idea of the laissez-faire state has been replaced by the idea of the social welfare state. Th e scope of state activity has increased.

#### **270** Chapter 24

**(ii)** Th e functions earlier performed by the local government have been shifted to the central government.

**(iii)** Th e infl uence of pressure groups has increased on the state.

**(iv)** Th e barriers of nationalism have been broken and the idea of a world state is gaining ground.

**(v)** Democracy has become the common form of government. However, the society suffers from many political ills such as the role of money during elections, electoral drawbacks, bogus voting, politics being made a profession, and criminalization of politics.

**(vi)** Th e state has assumed a secular character and people have been ensured the protection of fundamental rights.

**(vii)** Th e size and power of bureaucracy have increased.

**(viii)** Th e volume of legislation has expanded in order to achieve the goal of socialism.

**IV. Caste system:** Any study of the Indian society is incomplete without the study of the caste system—a centuries-old system which, despite all the criticism and the evils it has caused, continues to exist and infl uence the Indian society in numerous ways. In the modem Indian society, the rigidity of the caste system has undergone changes and rigid distinctions are watering down. Th e various reformist movements, legislations during the British rule, impact of industrial revolution, constitutional measures, and post-independence social legislation have thinned the impact of caste on the Indian society. However, vested interests will never allow its abolition. Among such vested interests the prominent ones are the political and caste leaders who fl ourish on casteism. Sadly enough, casteism still retains its hold in the land of Mahatma Gandhi—the apostle of non-violence and casteless society.

**V. Changes in values:** We have described above the broad trends and tendencies of change in contemporary Indian society institutions; we may now look into the ideological tenets of the Indian society. Th e important values of a traditional society in India are hierarchy, pluralism, and holism. Hierarchy implies the grada tion of units constituting the system in a superior–inferior relation. Th e status in ancient India was astrictive one (i.e., one was assigned the status by birth). While the ideology of hierarchy institutionalized inequality in society, it allocated a secure and defi nite place to each individual and caste group.

Pluralism implies tolerance of others' modes of life, beliefs, and traditions while preserving their own. Hinduism is the ancient and dominant religion of India which tolerated the faiths of all those groups who entered India from foreign lands, including the faiths of invaders and exploiters. India is a land of unity in diver sity which very explicitly manifests its pluralistic character.

Holism signifi es relationship between an individual and a group in which the latter had primary over the former. Individuals were supposed to sacrifi ce their interests for the interests of the community. Th ey were subservient to collectivity—be it a family, village, or caste.

Th e ideology, which the Indian society pursues today, is enshrined in the constitution which is embedded in the basic ideals of socialism, secularism, and democracy. Th e Indian type of socialism is not Marxian socialism which believes in a ruthless dictatorship to wipe out the capitalistic structure of society. It does not attempt collectivization of private property, but only seeks to limit it. Th e institution of private property continues to be an essential feature of Indian economy. Secularism means tolerance of other religious communities and giving them the right to perform and propagate their religion. Tolerance of diversity is the basic thrust in the Indian ideology of secularism. Indian democracy like other democracies emphasizes equality of opportunity and right to participation in the decision-making process. It may be noted that in the traditional social system of India individuals have never been an autonomous entity making decisions for them. Th ey are guided and controlled by traditional values and rigid institutional structures.

To what extent are the traditional social values reconcilable with the modem social values? Can they be fused or synthesized? It seems to be no contradiction between the traditional value of pluralism and the modern value of secularism because both imply tolerance of the other's way of life. One basic diff erence between the two may, however, be understood. While pluralism of the past was associated with the distinct and deep traditions for each of the groups which often provided legitimacy for special privileges and prerogatives as in the case of Brahmans, the secularism of today calls on the privileged groups to understand and appreciate the norms and values of the less-privileged groups called the 'minorities'. For example, the Hindus should appreciate the social values of the Muslims. Under the traditional value of hierarchy, resources are allocated and rewards are distributed on the basis of birth, which is in direct contravention to the principle of need-based distribution implied in socialism. Th us the two are irreconcilable. Likewise, the values of holism and democracy are mutually inimical because while under holism hardly any autonomy is bestowed on the individual who remains encompassed in the current of collective life, democracy, on the other hand, values individual liberty wherein the pursuit of self-interest ignoring collective good is not non- existent. Th e spirit of individualism, implied in democracy, rebels against the value of socialism as it bestows undue importance on the welfare of individuals and ignores collective welfare. To argue that the welfare of individuals will lead to the welfare of all is fallacious because no system can do it. Any substantial disparity in the distribution of material resources becomes a fertile ground for the emergence of social movements which emphasize equality as their main objective.

## **SOCIAL DISORGANIZATION**

The process of social change in India has given birth to social disorganization. The multifarious changes taking place in Indian society have put it on the crossroads where it is faced with the problem of traditionalism versus modernism or in another sense Indianization versus westernization. The social changes have brought about functional imbalance between the various parts of the social structure which has threatened its harmonious and smooth functioning. The many functions once performed in the family are now performed by outside agencies such as hospitals, kindergartens, creches, nursery homes, and schools. The state has stepped in and taken over the functions of looking after the old and disabled and provides social security, employment, and recreation. Society is the web of social relationships. In an organized society, social relations have some patterns and mechanism. When the relations get disturbed and become disordered, there is social disorder and society loses its functional equilibrium. Social disorganization is social disequilibrium within customs, institutions, groups, and communities. Social disorganization also creates personal disorganization, since a person is a social creation and a social product. In short, the society in India is today affected with disorganization in the family, rural and urban disorganization, and disorganization in the fields of both economic and political structures.

Today, we can see comprehensive changes in the Indian social institution, attitudes, values, and morals for which a heavy price is being paid in the form of social tensions, casteism, religious fundamentalism, family breakdown, marital maladjustment, juvenile delinquency, slums and epidemics, regional imbalance, communalism and violence, decay of moral and social values,

 linguistic fanaticism, political degeneration, economic and social exploitation, poverty and unemployment, agrarian unrest, peasant dissatisfactions, and personality disorganization.
