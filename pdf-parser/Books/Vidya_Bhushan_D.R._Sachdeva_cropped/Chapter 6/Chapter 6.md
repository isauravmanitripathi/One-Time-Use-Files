# **6 Max Weber and Karl Marx**

# **MAX WEBER**

Max Weber was born in 1864 in Germany. In the beginning, he studied law. Later, he shifted to the study of social sciences, his Ph.D. thesis was on the 'History of Commercial Societies in the Middle Ages'. In 1896, he became professor of Economics. In addition to his scholarly concerns, Weber also pursued his political interests. It appeared that he will be a major fi gure in German intellectual life. In 1897, Weber had a clash with his father and after a month his father died. Shortly thereafter, Weber suff ered a complete breakdown and did not recover for more than fi ve years. He travelled a great deal, especially to Switzerland and Italy. Th en almost unexpectedly in 1903, his intellectual forces were gradually restored. He became the editor of a leading German Social Science Journal. He again resumed a full writing career, but returned to teaching only in the last few years of his life. In the last three years of his life, that is, 1918–1920, he again took active part in politics and wrote a number of newspaper articles and papers on politics of the hour. Weber died in June, 1920.

# **Social Action**

In the fi eld of sociology, Weber's point of departure is the distinction between four types of actions, which are as follows:

- **(i)** Zweck rational action
- **(ii)** Wert rational action
- **(iii)** Aff ective action
- **(iv)** Traditional action

A brief description of these four types of actions is as follows:

**Zweck rational action:** Th is is a rational action which is performed in relation to a goal. It corresponds to Pareto's logical action. For example, action of the engineer, who is building a bridge or army general who wants to win a war. In such actions, an actor clearly knows his goals and selects specifi c means to attain these goals. However, Weber defi nes rationality in terms of knowledge of the actor.

**Wert rational action:** Th is type of action is also rational action, but in relation to values; for example, a brave captain goes down with his sinking ship. His action is rational not because it seeks to attain a defi nite and external goal, but because to abandon the sinking ship would be regarded as dishonourable.

**Aff ective action:** Th is type of action is emotional and is dictated primarily by the state of mind of the actor; for example, the slap which the mother gives her child because of his bad behaviour. In this case, the action is not oriented to a goal or a system of value, rather it is determined by an emotional reaction of the actor in a given set of circumstances.

**Traditional action:** Th is type of action is dictated by beliefs and customs that become habitual. In this case, the individual performs the action according to the customs or traditions which have become a part of his personality because of conditioning.

According to Weber, the subject matter of sociology is social action. In sociology, an eff ort has to be made to understand the meanings which an individual attaches to his conduct. Th e classifi cation of action into various types by Weber is governed to a certain extent by interpretation of the contemporary period of history. According to him, the major characteristic of the modern world is rationalization, which is expressed in the sphere of Zweck rational actions.

# **Concept of Ideal Types**

Th e main concern of Weber was to defi ne generalized categories for the analysis of social phenomena. He developed the concept of ideal types for such an analysis. In the words of Shils and Finch, 'An ideal type is formed by the one-sided accentuation of one or more points of view and by the synthesis of a great many diff use, discrete, more or less present, and occasionally absent concrete individual phenomena, which are arranged according to those one-sidedly emphasised viewpoints into a unifi ed analytical construct'. Th us, an ideal type is a methodological tool that serves the investigator as a measuring rod to ascertain similarities as well as deviations in concrete cases.

According to Weber, there are two types of meaning of an action: (a) actually existing meaning to a concrete individual action and (b) a theoretically conceived pure type of subjective meaning. Th e second type of meaning is the principle that is known as the ideal type. Th e ideal type is not merely an abstraction but a specifi c type of abstraction. Th e ideal type presents a pattern that may not exist in reality, but is constructed by the sociologist for comprehending the meaning of social actions. Th e ideal type is the methodological tool that enables the sociologist to analyse and comprehend the social actions. Th is ideal type does not describe concrete course of action, but under normal conditions an ideal course of action. It does not describe an individual course of action, but a typical one. Th us, ideal type is a generalized concept and by using it, the sociologist can classify a large number of cases in a few categories. For example, the typology of social action and authority presented by Weber is an ideal type which concentrates attention on extreme or polar types.

Weber defi nes ideal types negatively, that is, by describing what it is not. According to him

- **(a)** It is not a hypothesis in the sense that it is a proposition about concrete reality, which is verifi able.
- **(b)** It is not a description of reality or existing process.
- **(c)** It is not average in the sense what we say that the average man weighs 70 kg.
- **(d)** It is not a formulation of concrete traits common to a class of concrete things.

According to Weber, it is necessary for the sociologist to construct pure ideal type of actions in order to give precise meaning to them. He points out that the case is similar to a physical reaction which is carried forward on the assumption of an absolute vacuum. In case of sociology also, the theoretical analysis is possible only in terms of such pure ideal types. According to him, the ideal type serves its methodological function in a better way if it is more and more abstract and unrealistic. Ideal type is mentally constructed. It is constructed by exaggeration or accentuation of one or more elements or points of view observable in reality. Th e type thus constructed may be called ideal because it exists only as an ideal. It is a tool or a method of analysis for the comprehension of concrete events or situations. Weber made extensive use of ideal type method in the sociological analysis. Th e formulation of ideal types is based on an extensive study of a large number of social phenomena, and he seems to select the traits to be included in an ideal type rather intuitively.

# **Types of Authority**

According to Weber, authority relations refer to those relations of men whereby some men feel that they have a legitimate right to expect willing obedience from other people to their command. Weber has constructed the typology of authority as an ideal type. He distinguished three main types of authority, which are as follows:

**(a) Rational–legal authority:** Th is type of authority is based on rational grounds and justifi ed by laws, rules, and regulations. It is generally found in modern society. Th e hierarchical relationships are governed by this type of authority. Th e rational legitimacy rests on a belief in the legality of rules and the rights of those having legal authority to issue commands.

**(b) Traditional:** Th is type of authority is based on domination of past customs or traditions. It is generally found in pre-modern societies. Th e traditional authority is based on a belief in the sacred quality of the traditions and legitimacy of thoughts. Th is type of authority is exercised by persons who have either inherited it or have been granted this authority by a higher authority. In the present age, in those countries which still have monarchy, traditional domination persists symbolically, but not actually. Th e traditional legitimacy rests on an established belief in the sanctity of past traditions and the legitimacy of the status of those exercising authority under them.

**(c) Charismatic authority:** Th is type of authority is based on an extraordinary devotion to the sacred quality or exemplary character of a person and of the order created by him. For example, Mahatma Gandhi exercised authority that can be called charismatic. Th is type of authority is neither based on the rationality of rules and regulations nor on long-standing traditions, but on the devotion of men for certain other persons who are able to infl uence them on the basis of their character, virtue, or honesty.

# **Bureaucracy**

Max Weber was the fi rst to give an elaborate account of the development of bureaucracy as well as its causes and consequences. He attributed the following characteristics to bureaucracy:

 **1.** Th e principle of fi xed and offi cial jurisdictional areas that are generally ordered by rules. Th e regular activities associated with each status are distributed in a fi xed way as offi cial duties. Th e structure of authority is clearly laid down and strictly delimited by rules.

 **2.** Th e principle of offi ce hierarchy and levels of graded authority with a fi rmly ordered system of super-ordination and subordination in which there is a supervision of the lower offi ces by the higher ones.

 **3.** A division of labour based on specialized functions and responsibilities.

 **4.** A system of written documents (the fi les) defi ning the procedure as well as the rights and duties of people in all positions.

 **5.** Offi ce management based on thorough and expert training.

 **6.** Selection for employment and promotion based on technical competence, specialized knowledge, or skill.

 **7.** Offi ce-holding as a 'vocation'. Offi cial work is no longer a secondary activity, but something that demands the full working capacity of the offi cial.

 **8.** Provision for pecuniary compensation as a fi xed salary.

 **9.** Appointment of employees by higher offi cials, rather than by election.

**10.** Th e system of tenure for life. Normally, the position of the bureaucrat is held for life as specifi ed by contract.

**11.** A clear distinction between the sphere of offi ce and that of the private aff airs of the individual. Th e bureaucratic offi cial is not an owner of the enterprise and, therefore, not entitled to the use of offi cial facilities for personal needs except as defi ned by strict rules.

**12.** Th e practice of performing specialized administrative functions, according to purely objective considerations and the offi cial discharge of business according to calculable rules and 'without regard for persons'.

According to Weber, the most important factors contributing to the development of modern bureaucracy are as follows:

**(a)** Th e development of money economy, which guaranteed a constant income for maintaining bureaucracy through a stable system of taxation; it also encouraged a pecuniary compensation for the offi cials and a purely economic conception of the offi ce as a source of the offi cial's private income.

**(b)** Th e quantitative development of administrative tasks, especially in the fi eld of politics where 'the great state and mass party are the classic soil for bureaucratization'.

**(c)** Qualitative changes of administrative tasks. Among purely political factors, the demand for order and production and for the so called welfare state and among essentially technical factors, the development of modern means of communication, especially the railroads and the mass media, operate in the direction of bureaucratization.

**(d)** Th e purely technical superiority of bureaucracy over any other form of organization.

**(e)** Th e complicated and specialized nature of modern culture that demands 'the personally detached and strictly objective expert, in lieu of the master of older social structures, who was moved by personal sympathy and favour, by grace and gratitude'.

**(f)** Th e rational interpretation of law on the basis of strictly formal conception of 'equality before the law' and the demand for legal guarantees against arbitrariness.

**(g)** Th e concentration of the material means of management in the hands of the master as exemplifi ed in the development of big capitalist enterprises and the giant public organizations such as the modern state or army.

**(h)** Th e levelling of economic and social diff erences and the corresponding rise of modern mass representative democracy in contrast to the old democratic self-government of small homogeneous communities.

Although Weber emphasizes the virtues of bureaucracy and its unquestionable advancement in modern society, he also conceded the vices of bureaucracy, that is, the inevitable depersonalization of human relationship in government and industry. He refers to the formalism and the rules-bound character of bureaucratic organization and increasing concentration of the materials of management. According to Weber, bureaucracy is inevitable, irrepressible, and inescapable.

# **Sociology of Religion**

Weber's essay 'Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism' is considered the classical study in the fi eld of sociology of religion. In this work, Weber sought to demonstrate that economic factors do not represent a constant and independent variable to which all others stand in dependence. In the opinion of Weber, the treatment of economic factor as a determining factor was the major weakness of Marx and the ultimate failure of his theoretical formulation. Weber emphasized that economic factors are, as Abraham puts it, 'one variable, a very important one, in close relationship with others aff ected by them as in fact it in turn can aff ect them'.

Weber analysed the relationship between the religious values and economic interests. He noticed that Protestants, particularly of the Calvinist sect, were the chief captains of the industry and possessed more wealth and economic means than other religious groups, notably Catholics. Th erefore, he wanted to ascertain whether there is an essential harmony between the Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism. He also sought to fi nd out whether and to what extent a cluster of values in the religions of India, China, and Middle East facilitated or hindered the development of capitalism.

In order to overcome the methodological problem of defi ning capitalism and Protestant ethic, Weber made use of the concept of ideal type. Protestant ethic does not refer to any particular theological doctrine, but a set of values and belief systems that make up a religious ideal. Capitalism, in its ideal type, is thought of by Weber to be that complex activity designed specifi cally to maximize profi t through the careful and intentional exercise of rational organization and management of production.

Weber identifi ed the following values embedded in Protestantism that are in harmony with the spirit of capitalism:

**1. Th e shift from ritualistic and other worldly orientation to down-to-earth pragmatism:** Th e fi nite mind of man cannot comprehend the infi nite mind of God who created the world for his own glory. Th erefore, there is no point in indulging in mysticism; rather man should seek to understand the natural order. Th is is essentially an anti-ritualistic attitude that favours the development of science and rational investigation.

**2. Changed attitude towards work:** Protestant ethic proclaims work as virtue, something not only good and desirable, but contributing to the glory of God as well.

**3. Th e concept of calling:** Th is idea emerged from the Calvinist doctrine of predestination according to which every soul is predestined at birth for heaven or hell and that nothing an individual does in his life can change his ultimate fate. But there are signs by which God indicates to every individual whether he is among the elect, success in life being the most important one. Since every man is anxious to know if he is marked for salvation or damnation, he should select a calling, a vocation, work hard at it, and be successful. Th e new doctrine encourages people to seek gainful enterprises, accumulate wealth, and prove their destiny.

**4. Th e new attitude towards the collection of interest on loans:** Th e theological doctrine of Catholicism proscribed the collection of interest on loans. However, according to Calvinism, there is no restriction on the collection of interest on loans. Th is Calvinistic ethic led to a spurt of economic activity: establishment of lending houses, new investments, and new fl oating capital.

**5. Structures on alcoholism:** Protestant ethic prohibits the consumption of alcoholic beverages; there is no comparable theological doctrine in Catholicism.

**6. Encouragement of literacy and learning:** Protestant ethic emphasized that every man should read his own Bible rather than depend on priestly interpretations. Th is led to the development of mass education and of specialized skills.

**7. Rejection of holidays:** Th e Catholic Calendar is full of holy days and almost every holy day is a holiday. However, according to Protestant ethic, work contributes to the glory of God, and thus there is no need for celebrations on holy days.

**8. Protestant Asceticism:** Protestant ethic emphasizes the notion that earthly things and fl esh belong to the order of sin and death and, therefore, one should abstain from the pleasures of the world. Th us, on the one hand, Protestant ethic encourages people to accumulate wealth and on the other hand, it forbids the use of wealth for enjoyment. Th e wealth should be used for producing more and more, undoubtedly a condition par excellence for the development of capitalism.

After establishing the essential harmony between Protestant ethic and the spirit of Capitalism, Weber turned to other religions to see if there is a discernible cluster of values in them comparable to Protestant ethic, which is favourable to the rise of capitalism. He found a variety of non-religious, social, and economic conditions conducive to the development of capitalism in China and India, but the ethical system of Confucianism and the doctrine of Karma in Hinduism were not particularly favourable. Moreover, the combination of religious values that constituted the Protestant ethic was unique: an unusual blend of two apparently inconsistent notions, namely, limitless accumulation of wealth and abstention from enjoyment. It would be wrong to assume that Weber replaced a  one-sided economic determinism with one-sided ideological determinism. He considered a variety of factors—social, economic, and political—but the confl uence of values inherent in religion played a central role in the matrix of interrelationships.

# **KARL MARX**

Karl Marx lived from 1818 to 1883. He initially studied law and later he turned to the study of philosophy. In 1841, at the age of 23, he received the doctorate degree. After completing his studies, he began writing for a radical left-wing paper in Cologne and became its editor in 1842. After the closure of the paper, Marx travelled to Paris. During his stay in Paris, he met Friedrich Engels and the friendship between the two was immediate and eternal. Both of them wrote a number of classic works together. Th e major works of Karl Marx include, *Th e Communist Manifesto*, *Contributions to a Critique of Political Economy*, *Th e Class Struggle in France*, and the classic three volume work, *Das Kapital*.

# **Hegel and Marx**

Georg F. W. Hegel was a German philosopher who dominated the intellectual climate of his day. While Marx was living in Berlin, he became young Hegelian by virtue of Hegel's thought. Th e basic idea of Hegel's philosophy is that the essence of reality is reason, but the spirit of reason manifests itself only gradually, revealing more and more facets of itself during the course of time. Th e most important idea, which Marx adopted from Hegel, was that of 'dialectics'. According to Hegel, each statement of truth or thesis has its opposite statement or antithesis that may be reconciled on a higher level of synthesis. But this is not the end for the dialectical process; the chain continues, as the synthesis becomes a new thesis with its antithesis, and so on. Th e adoption of dialectical method is the only similarity between Marx and Hegel. Hegel perceived truth in ideas, but for Marx, ideas are not the realm of truth but rather matter is. Accordingly, Hegel's conception could be called 'dialectical idealism', whereas the conception of Marx can be considered as 'dialectical materialism'.

Marx like Hegel was also interested in the analysis of the truth of history, but Hegel advocated an idealistic approach to history, whereas Marx emphasized the materialistic approach. Th erefore, it is generally remarked that Marx turned Hegel upside down.

Th e shift, from Hegelian idealism to historical materialism led Marx to believe that the motivating factor in human existence was not ideas about religion and society, but a materialistic realism having to do with survival. Th is survival, the necessity to produce the means of subsistence, was fundamental to human life and human action in community and society. In the words of Marx, 'Th e fi rst historical act is the production of material life itself. Th is is indeed a historical act, a fundamental condition of all history'.

According to Marx, 'Men begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistence. In producing their means of subsistence men indirectly produced their actual material life'. Th is stage occurs within the framework of a progressive historical evolution. Just as Comte distinguished three phases of human evolution, on the basis of ways of thinking, Marx identifi ed four stages of human history on the basis of modes of production: primitive communism, ancient slave production, feudalism, and capitalism. Primitive communism signifi es communal ownership; ancient mode of production was characterized by slavery; the feudal mode of production by serfdom, and the capitalist system by the bourgeois exploitation and wage earners. Each of these stages, except primitive communism, constituted a distinct mode of man's exploitation by man and his struggle for freedom.

# **Dialectical Materialism**

As explained above, Marx turned from Hegelian idealism to materialism, Marx made good use of the dialectical method in what came to be called 'dialectical materialism' or 'historical materialism". Hegel was an idealist who asserted the primacy of mind, whereas Marx was a materialist who asserted the primacy of the matter. According to Marx, matter is not a product of mind; on the contrary, mind is simply the most advanced product of matter.

Larson has outlined the basic postulates of Marxian dialectical method as follows:

- **(i)** All the phenomena of nature are part of an integrated whole.
- **(ii)** Nature is in a continuous state of movement and change

**(iii)** Th e developmental process is a product of quantitative advances that culminate in abrupt qualitative changes.

**(iv)** Contradictions are inherent in all realms of nature, particularly human society.

Th is methodology perceived history as a series of stages based on a particular mode of production and characterized by a particular type of economic organization. Because of the inherent contradictions, each stage contained the seeds of its own destruction. In the words of Stalin, 'the dialectical method holds that the process of development should be understood not as a movement in a circle, not a simple repetition of what' has already occurred, but as an onward and upward movement, as transition from an old qualitative state to a new qualitative state, from the lower to the higher'. Marx believed that society may be functioning quite effi ciently, but it is destined to face revolution until the fi nal breakdown of all class divisions. According to Timasheff , 'Even when a society exemplifi es the best that mankind can establish in terms of harmony and cooperation, in time, the established order becomes an obstacle to progress and a new order (antithesis) begins to arise. A struggle ensues between the class representing the old order and the class representing the new order. Th e emerging class is eventually victorious creating a new order of production that is synthesis of the old and the new. Th is new order, however, contains the seeds of its eventual destruction and the dialectical process continues'. Th e inevitability of the continuing struggle is related to the emergence of the division of labour within society, for it is this phenomenon of labour diff erentiation that forms antagonistic classes that, in turn, become the centre of competition and struggle against nature as well as against other elements within the society.

Th e use of the dialectic in the analysis of society and history became a major characteristic of Marxism. According to Lenin, 'materialism in general recognises objectively real being (matter) as independent of consciousness, sensation experience … Consciousness is only the refl ection of being, at best and approximately true (adequate, ideal) refl ection of it'. A further clarifi cation is provided by Stalin on materialism in the following words, 'Marx's philosophical materialism holds the world by its very nature material, that the multi-fold phenomena of the world constitute diff erent forms of matter in motion, that interconnection and interdependence of phenomena, as established by the dialectical method, are a law of the development of moving matter and that the world develops in accordance with the laws of movement in matter and stands in no need of a universal spirit'.

## **Economic Infrastructure and Socio-Economic Superstructure**

Although Marx did not constantly argue for a crude economic determinism, he left no doubt that he considered the economy to be the foundation of whole socio-cultural system. Throughout their study, Marx and Engels emphasized the primacy of economic factor in human relationship and the centrality of the economic dimension in the political structures. The economic system of production and distribution, or the means and relations of production in the Marxian sense, constitute the basic structure of society, on which are built all other social institutions, particularly the state and the legal system. According to Engels, 'the production of immediate material means of subsistence, and consequently, the degree of economic development attained by a given people or during a given epoch, form the foundation upon which the state institutions, the legal conceptions, the ideas on art, and even on religion of the people concerned have been evolved'.

Marx's economic interpretation of history and social change is amply clear from the following quotation, 'In the social production which men carry on, they enter into defi nite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will; the relations of production correspond to a defi nite stage of development of their material powers of production. Th e sum total of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society—the real foundation on which rise legal and political superstructures and which correspond defi nite forms of social consciousness. Th e mode of production in material life determines the general character of the social, political and spiritual processes of life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence but, on the contrary, their social existence determines their consciousness'. According to Marx, 'Human thought, human awareness, and human consciousness, were not self-originating, but were derivatives of the economic principles. And it is in the arena of political economy that governments and religions must be controlled and human consciousness brought under dominance; particularly when it comes to the governance of the material world, men must realise that the social environment is dependent upon the economics of the situation and the classes'. As Doyle Johnson reminds us, 'Marx may have overstated his case to establish his point against competing viewpoints, but Marx's economic interpretation of history provides a note of hard realism that is sometimes lacking in more idealistic theories of society'.

# **Theory of Class and Class Confl ict**

According to Marx, a social class is any aggregate of persons who perform the same function in the organization of production. It is determined not by occupation or income, but by the position an individual occupies and the function he performs in the process of production. For example, two carpenters, of whom one is the shop owner and the other his paid worker, belong to two diff erent classes even though their occupation is the same. Bendix and Lipset have identifi ed fi ve variables that determine a class in the Marxian sense:

**1.** Confl icts over the distribution of economic rewards between the classes.

**2.** Easy communication between the individuals in the same class and positions, so that ideas and action programmes are readily disseminated.

**3.** Growth of class consciousness in the sense that the members of the class have a feeling of solidarity and understanding of their historic role.

**4.** Profound dissatisfaction of the lower class over its inability to control the economic structure of which it feels itself to be the exploited victim.

**5.** Establishment of a political organization resulting from the economic structure, the historical situation, and maturation of class consciousness.

According to Marxian viewpoint, from the beginning of human existence in community, society has been divided into classes because of its absolute dependence on the division of labour. Th e following classic statement of Marx's clearly states his views on classes and class struggles, 'the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Free men and slave, patrician and plebian, lord and serf, guild master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fi ght, a fi ght that each time ended either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large or in the common ruin of the contending classes'.

Marx was not only interested in the origin of class, he was even more interested in the future of class, especially as that future relates to the emergence of class consciousness, awareness of shared interests, and the necessity of mutual support to other struggling classes against the ruling class. Marx made a distinction between 'class in itself' and 'class for itself. Th is distinction is refl ected in the movement from a class's potential self-awareness to actual self-awareness. Only when the ' common struggle' as a point of consciousness appears within a class, does that class actually emerge as a potential power force.

According to Marxian viewpoint, social class was bigger than the individual and the individual was dominated by it. In the words of Marx, 'here individuals are dealt with only in so far as they are personifi cations of economic categories, embodiments of particular class relations and class interests'. To deal with the predicament of the modern man, alienated, dominated, and estranged from himself, his neighbour, and his world, the analyst must not begin with the individual, but with the social structures within which the individual is essentially caught up and lost as a person.

Th e main aspects of Marx's theory of class confl ict have been described below:

**(i) Th e development of the proletariat:** Marx described the process of development of the proletariat as follows, 'Th e fi rst attempts of the workers to associate among themselves always take place in the form of combinations (unions). Large-scale industry concentrates, in one place, a crowd of people unknown to one another. Competition divides their interests. But the maintenance of wages, this common interest, which they have against their boss, unites them in a common thought of resistance combination. Th us, combination always has a double aim, that of stopping the competition among themselves, in order to bring about a general competition with the capitalist'.

**(ii) Th e importance of property:** According to Marx, the most distinctive feature of any society is its form of property, and the crucial determinant of an individual's behaviour is his relation to the property. Property divisions are the crucial breaking lines in the class structure.

**(iii) Th e identifi cation of economic and political power and authority:** Although classes are based on forces and relations of production, they become socially signifi cant only in the political sphere. Since the capitalist society is based on the concentration of the means of production and distribution in the hands of a few, political power becomes the means by which the ruling class perpetuates its domination and exploitation of the masses.

**(iv) Polarization of classes:** According to Marx, 'Th e whole society breaks up more and more into two hostile camps, two great directly antagonistic classes: bourgeoisie and proletariat'. Th e capitalists own the means of production and distribution and the working classes own nothing but their labour. Th is is not to deny the existence of other classes. Marx referred to other classes as small capitalists, the petit bourgeoisie, and the lumpen proletariat.

**(v) Th e theory of surplus value:** Th e capitalists accumulate profi t through the exploitation of labour. Th e value of any commodity is determined by the amount of labour it takes to produce it. Th e worker works half of the time for himself and the other half for the capitalist. Th e term surplus value·refers to the quantity of value produced by the worker beyond the necessary labour and time (the working time required to produce a value equal to the one he has received in the form of wages). Since the employers have the monopoly of the instruments of production, they can force the workers to do extra hours of work, and profi ts tend to accumulate with increasing exploitation of labour.

**(vi) Pauperization:** Poverty of the proletariat grows with increasing exploitation of labour. According to Marx, 'In every mode of production, there is exploitation of man by man, the social product is so distributed that the majority of people, the people who labour, are condemned to toil for no more than the barest necessities of life. On the other hand, a minority, the owners of means of production, the property owners, enjoy leisure and luxury. Society is divided into rich and poor'. Th us, according to Marxian viewpoint, poverty is the result of exploitation and not of scarcity.

**(vii) Alienation:** According to Marx, 'Within the capitalist system all methods for raising the social productiveness of labour are brought about at the cost of the individual labourer; all means for the development of production transform themselves into means of domination over and exploitation of the producer, they mutilate the labourer into a fragment of a man, degrade him to the level of an appendage of a machine, destroy every remnant of charm in his work and turn it into hatex toil; they estrange from him intellectual potentialities of the labour process in the same proportion as science is incorporated in it as an independent power. As a result of the plight of the workers described above, the product of work becomes an instrument of alien purpose; the worker becomes estranged from himself, from the process as well as the product of his labour, from his fellow-men, and from human community itself.

**(viii) Class solidarity and antagonism:** In the words of Marx, '… with the development of industry, the proletariat only increases in number, it becomes concentrated in greater masses, its strength grows, and it feels that strength more … ! Collisions between individual workman and individual bourgeoisie take more and more the character of collisions between two classes. Th ereupon, the workers begin to form combination (trade unions) against the bourgeoisie; they club together in order to keep up the rate of wages; they found permanent associations in order to make provisions beforehand for the occasional revolts. Here and there the contest breaks out into riots'.

**(ix) Revolution:** At the height of the class war, a violent revolution breaks out which destroys the structure of the capitalist society. Th is revolution is most likely to occur at the peak of an economic crisis, which is part of the recurring booms and repressions, characteristic of capitalism.

**(x) Th e dictatorship of the proletariat:** Th e bloody revolution terminates capitalist society and leads to the social dictatorship of the proletariat! Th e revolution is violent, but does not necessarily involve mass killings of the bourgeoisie. Since property is wrested from the bourgeoisie, they will cease to *have* power and will be transformed into the ranks of the proletariat.

**(xi) Inauguration of the communist society:** Socialization of eff ective private properly will eliminate class, and thereby the causes of social confl ict. Th e state will eventually wither away as it becomes obsolete in a classless society in which nobody owns anything, but everybody owns everything and each individual contributes according to his ability and receives according to his need.

# **Alienation**

Th e material life conditions generate alienation and no institution, whether religious, political, or economic is exempted from the condition of alienation. In the words of Marx, 'Objectifi cation is the practice of alienation. Just as man, so long as he is engrossed in religion, can only objectify his essence by an alien and fantastic being, so under the sway of egoistic need, he can only affi rm himself and produce objects in practice by subordinating his products and his own activity to the domination of an alien entity, and by attributing to them, the signifi cance of an alien entity, named money'.

Marx was particularly interested in the process of alienation in the capitalist society. As a result of his close association with Engels, Marx became personally aware of the anguish, and alienation of the urban industrial workers. While alienation is commonplace in capitalist society and dominates every institutional sphere such as religion, economy, and polity, its predominance in workplace assumes an overriding importance for Marx. Th e alienated or estranged labour involves four aspects: workers' alienation from the object he produces, from the process of production, from himself, and from the community of his fellowmen.

Th e worker puts his life into the object he creates, but the very object becomes an instrument of alien purpose and strengthens the hands of his exploiters. Th e worker becomes a slave of his object. In the words of Marx, 'Th e alienation of the workers in his product means not only that his labour becomes an object, an external existence, but that it exists outside him, independently, something alien to him and that it becomes a power on its own confronting him; it means that the life which he has conferred on the object confronts him as something hostile and alien'. In short, the worker spends his life and produces everything not for himself but for the powers that manipulate him. Marx has identifi ed two hostile powers that render labour and its product alien. One is the 'other man', the capitalist who commands production. Th e other is the economic system, the market situation, which governs the behaviour of capital and the process of production. Th e former is a human power and the latter an inhuman power. According to Marx, 'Alienation is apparent not only in the fact that my means of life belong to someone else, but also that … an inhuman power rules over everything'. Th e impersonal forces of the market economy are alien to the worker, they make him dependent upon all the fl uctuations in the market price and in the movement of capital. Th ey have no regard for his welfare, are independent of his will, and ultimately produce his beggary or starvation.
