# **9 Work and Economic Institutions**

Th e fi rst important task for a society is to maintain itself. Th ere must be food, clothing, and shelter for its members. Modern man spends most of his time making a living. It is not suffi cient only to have a system of production in society, equally important is its distributive system. Th e more complex the society, the more its welfare rests on the distributive system. In a simple society, the problem of distribution is simple because the society is usually self-supporting. Th e family in the simple society satisfi es its needs almost directly. But in a complex society, goods pass through many hands until they reach the consumers. In our country, one of the major causes of economic ills is maldistribution of goods. Economic institutions arise out of the determinations we make with respect to the goods we need. Th ey are the basic ideas, norms, and statuses which govern our economic life.

Th e twentieth century has brought about mass production, rise of many near-monopolies, and a high degree of division of labour. Th e consumer has become more and more dependent on the institutions of the market place. Advertising profoundly infl uences consumers' wants and habits of buying. A product is associated with a popular fi lm star so that it may appeal the people. Th e nature of retailing has changed. Th e government takes an increasing interest in consumer protection. Th ere are laws providing for pure food and drugs and for standard methods of packing and labelling. Th e prices are fi xed by the government. Th e traditional theory of economic competition has now been replaced by governmental control in the fi elds of production, distribution, exchange, and consumption. Th e age of laissez-faire is gone.

#### **INSTITUTION OF CAPITALISM AND ITS GROWTH**

In primitive societies, the usual system of exchanging goods was the *barter system.* Trading came gradually to involve money as a medium of exchange. According to Simmel, 'Th e establishment of the *institution of money* in the economic system of modern society has had far-reaching eff ects upon

almost every phase of life. It has made us pecuniary in our attitudes, so that everything is evaluated in terms of money, and social relations have become superfi cial and cold'.

Th e Industrial Revolution changed the techniques of production. To secure maximum production of goods, the new doctrine of 'laissez-faire' was propounded. Th e doctrine preached non-interference in economic matters. If individuals pursue their own interest, unhampered by restriction, they will achieve the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Its advocates, Adam Smith, J. S. Mill, Spencer, and Summer contended that government should remove all legal restrictions on trade, on production, on the exchange of wealth, and on the accumulation of property. Adam Smith enunciated four principles: (i) the doctrine of self- interest, (ii) laissez faire policy, (iii) the theory of competition, and (iv) profi t motive.

Upon these principles and in response to the changing techniques of production brought about by Industrial Revolution, a new system of property ownership and 'production' called capitalism developed.

#### **Features of Capitalism**

In the broadest sense, capitalism may be defi ned as the economic system making the widest use of capital in the process of production. In the technical sense, capitalism may be defi ned as the economic system of production in which capital goods are owned privately by individuals or corporations. Th e following are the economic bases of capitalism.

**(i) Private property:** Th e institution of private property lies at the basis of modern economic life. Th e right to property is considered an inviolable right.

**(ii) Large-scale production:** It is another important feature of capitalism. Capitalism arose as a result of industrial revolution, which made large-scale production possible.

**(iii) Profi t institution:** According to Marx, capitalism cannot exist in the absence of institution of profi t. Production under capitalism is profi t-oriented.

**(iv) Competition:** Competition is the inevitable result of a capitalist economy. Th ere is cut-throat competition under capitalism.

**(v) Price mechanism:** In capitalism the price of a commodity is determined not by the cost of production, but by the law of demand and supply.

**(vi) Wage institution:** In capitalism, the objective of the capitalist is to pay as less wages as possible and to take as much work out of the labour as possible. Th ere is exploitation of labour in capitalism.

**(vii) Money and credit:** In capitalism, the institution of credit has become important. Th e capitalists get credit and develop their business. Th us, despite a lack of capital, the capitalist increases his property on the basis of credit.

**(viii) Business organization:** Capitalism is marked by vast business structures. Th e capital of numerous shareholders is pooled and an industrial house is set up.

**(ix) Market economy:** Under capitalism, there is no governmental control over the forces of production, distribution, and exchange. It is controlled by the forces operating in the market. Th ere is no price control or regulated distribution by the government. Th e economy operates freely under the law of demand and supply. Th e capitalist economy is a liberalized or market economy.

## **Social Consequences of Capitalism**

Capitalism has brought in some good consequences, which are as follows:

**(i) High standard of living:** Capitalism is the product of industrialization. Industrialization has increased production, and the necessities of life are easily available.

**(ii) Economic progress:** Capitalism has led men to exploit the natural resources more and more. People exert themselves utmost for earning money. Th is has led to many inventions in the fi eld of industry, agriculture, and business, which have contributed to the economic progress.

**(iii) Exchange of culture:** Capitalism has led to international trade and exchange. People in diff erent countries have come nearer to each other. Th e development of the means of transport and communication has facilitated contacts among the peoples of the world, thereby leading to the exchange of ideas and culture.

**(iv) Lessening of racial diff erences:** Capitalism has also led to the lessening of diff erences based on race, creed, caste, and nationality. In the factory, the workers and offi cials belonging to diff erent castes co-operate with one another and work shoulder to shoulder.

## **Bad Eff ects of Capitalism**

In spite of the above good consequences, capitalism has proved a curse instead of a blessing. Its bad eff ects are as follows:

**(i) Greed for wealth:** Capitalism is based on greed for wealth. Wealth has become the be-all and end-all of human life. Th e modern man wants to earn more and more wealth by any means. Th e idea for morality does not enter into the means of earning. It has thus led to moral degeneration.

**(ii) Destruction of human values:** In a capitalist order, everything has come to be measured in terms of wealth. All values of human life such as sympathy, benevolence, love, and aff ection are evaluated in terms money.

**(iii) Materialism:** Capitalism manifests materialism in its extreme form. Religion and spirituality lose their force. Religion becomes the opium of people. Th e big capitalists save lakhs of rupees by evading tax through contribution to fi ctitious charitable institutions. While people are short of goods, the capitalists hoard them to soar the prices.

**(iv) Artifi ciality:** Capitalism has transformed modern culture into mere artifi ciality. One does not fi nd gentility and human touch. One can see false prestige, mere artifi ciality, and sheer advertisement even in art and literature, nothing to speak of diet, dress, and speech, etc. Life today has become artifi cial.

**(v) Emphasis on sex:** Th e capitalist culture lays emphasis on sex. Marriage has become a mere agreement for the satisfaction of sex hunger. Th e capitalists advertise their goods through the display of sex instincts. Literature and movies are based on sexual passion. Premarital and extramarital sexual relations are on the increase.

**(vi) Imbalance in social system:** Capitalism has led to an imbalance in the social system. It has widened the gap between the haves and have-nots and created insatiable greed for wealth among

the people. It has changed the very outlook of man and led to his moral degeneration. Moneymaking has become the be-all and end-all of life. Numerous scams have occurred in our country that have shaken the foundation of Indian economy. Karl Marx was its bitter critic.

## **PROPERTY**

## **Meaning of Property**

Property is a very important institution in the economy of societies. In terms of goods or things, property is one's own. It may be tangible or intangible. Tangible items are those that can be seen and touched. Clothing, ornaments, weapons, tools, utensils, houses, lands, automobile, animals, etc. are tangible items. Th e intangible property is that which cannot be seen and touched. Such property consists of goodwill, copyrights, trademark, etc. Most of our property consists of tangible items.

Understood in terms of rights the following are the characteristics of property rights:

**(i) Transferability:** Property can be transferred by its owner through sale, exchange, or gift. A landowner can transfer his land. A person can sell his automobile. But one cannot transfer one's skill, and so skill is not a property.

**(ii) Property rights do not necessarily imply actual use and enjoyment of objects by the owner:** Law makes a distinction between ownership and possession. One may own property without actually using it. In other words, possession of property may be in the hands of a person who is not its owner. A tenant is in possession of a house, but the house is not his property. It is the property of the landlord.

**(iii) Property refers to a concrete external object:** It is suggested by some writers that property rights refer to a concrete external object, but such a view limits narrowly the range of property rights. One can have property of intangible thing like goodwill. When one sells the goodwill of one's business, what he actually sells is not any external object. For example, if the manufacturers of 'Bajaj' electrical goods sell their goodwill, what they agree to is that they will not thereafter brand their goods by the name of 'Bajaj'. Th ey do not sell their goods, but only the name by which these goods were known in the market. Th ey have sold their property of goodwill.

**(iv) Property is usually non-human:** Th is means that the object of property has no rights of its own, but it is only the passive object of such rights. Th e land has no right of its own, it only serves the landowner. In other words, human beings cannot be the objects of property. A woman cannot be the property of her husband nor can the children be the property of their parents. Property rights apply only to those things that have no rights of their own.

## **Institution of Private Property**

An outstanding feature of modern economic life is the institution of private property. By private property we mean the things owned exclusively by a person or group of persons with the right to use them as desired. It diff ers from the public property in the sense that public property is owned by the community at large and administered by individuals or groups as agents of the community. For example, railways are public property. Th e land owned by a landlord is a private property. Th e private property may be distinguished from the public property in respect of the following points:

**(i)** Private property is owned by a person or group of persons, whereas public property is owned by the community.

**(ii)** Private property is usually used by its owner for his own good, whereas public property is used for public good.

**(iii)** Private property is subject to regulations by the state, whereas public property belongs to the state itself and is not subject to regulation by any external group. In other words, private property rights are subject to supervision, regulation, and control by the state.

Th e institution of private property has got both its strong supporters and bitter critics. On the one hand, if it is regarded as essential for social progress, on the other, it is called 'theft'. Th e economic institution of capitalism is based on private property.

## **Advantages of Private Property**

Th e advocates of the institution of private property put forth the following arguments:

**(i) Incentive to work:** Th e institution of private property induces a man to work hard, which is ultimately benefi cial to the community.

**(ii) Satisfaction of natural instinct:** Man has an acquisitive instinct. He wants to acquire something which he can call his own. He wants to have a house, an automobile, and several other things of comfort and luxury. He works hard to get these things and when he gets them he feels pleasure.

**(iii) Security against future:** Property is a foreguard against the wants of the morrow, and those who have no property, are uncertain whether the morrow will give them the means of life.

**(iv) Ethically sound:** Private property is justifi ed on the ground that it is the reward to an individual for his labour.

**(v) Nurse of virtues:** Private property creates social virtues like love of one's family, generosity, energy, philanthropy, etc. Th e man who has private property has a great stake in the country. It is on this account that some political thinkers have suggested that the right to vote should be given only to those who have some property.

**(vi) Economic progress:** Th e incentive to private property leads people to exert themselves utmost for earning money. Th is has led to many inventions in the fi eld of industry, agriculture, and business, which have contributed to economic progress.

**(vii) Historical justifi cation:** Th e institution of private property is also justifi ed on the basis of history. It is said that all the progressive societies are those that are built upon the system of private property. Th e United States is a progressive society, as it is based on the institution of private property and free enterprise.

## **Disadvantages of Private Property**

All the above-mentioned advantages of private property are said to be fallacious. Th e power to acquire property may defeat more incentives than it creates. In Russia, the right to private property

is severely limited. Yet the Russians are no less hardworking than the Americans. A person in order to acquire more property may indulge in unsocial or antisocial activities like adulteration, smuggling, hoarding, etc. Its possession may not necessarily be related to socially useful functions.

**(i) Greed for property:** Private property makes man greedy. He wants to earn more and more money by any means.

**(ii) Destruction of human values:** In a private property system, all values of human life such as love, sympathy, benevolence, and aff ection are evaluated in terms of silver coins.

**(iii) Basis of capitalism:** Th e institution of private property is the basis of capitalism. In capitalism, every person has the right to earn and maintain property. Th e right to property is considered sacred. Capitalism is injurious to both the individual and the society.

**(iv) Inequality:** Private property is a source of inequality. It creates wide gap between the haves and have-nots. Th e propertied class gets control of the political machinery and uses it for its personal advantage.

**(v) Economically inadequate:** Th e system of private property has lost the allegiance of the vast majority of the people. It is regarded with hate and indiff erence by them. Much of the private property is earned by a person without doing any socially useful work. A number of property owners are absentee owners. Th ey get paid for simply owning the productive instruments rather than for doing any kind of work.

In view of the above evils, the institution of private property has been criticized by socialists who want to establish collective ownership of property. However, there is need for restructuring of the institution of private property and its adjustment to the changing social system.

# **INSTITUTION OF DIVISION OF LABOUR**

## **Meaning of Division of Labour**

By division of labour we mean an arrangement whereby people perform diff erent functions at the same time. Although the term 'division of labour' refers only to labour and is applied in the fi eld of economics, the division of labour in the modern society is not limited simply to labour. It also applies to all the factors of production and exists beyond the purely economic fi eld. Th ere may be three forms of division of labour.

**(i) Social division of labour:** Th is means division in occupations. Th us, there are farmers, carpenters, weavers, teachers, priests, soldiers, etc.

**(ii) Technical division of labour:** Th is means division of labour within a particular enterprise. Th us, within a factory there are weavers, spinners, designers, accountants, managers, and engineers. Technical division of labour is a marked feature of the modern machine age.

**(iii) Territorial division of labour:** Th is is also known as localization of industries. Certain places or regions come to specialize in the making of certain articles; for example, hosiery at Ludhiana, cotton textile at Ahmedabad and Mumbai, jute industry at Kolkata, leather industry at Agra and Kanpur, etc.

Division of labour is based on the principle of co-operation or interdependence. Th e diff erent persons among whom the work is divided co-operate in the production of a thing; for example, to make a chair, one group is engaged in making legs, another in making backs, another seats, and still another joins them, and fi nally, there is a group of workers polishing the chairs. All of them cooperate, and through their cooperation a chair is made.

# **Social Dimensions of Division of Labour**

Division of labour is an inevitable feature of the modern industrial system. It is advantageous in the following ways:

**(i) Th e right man in the right place:** Under division of labour, the chance is that each man will get the job for which he is best fi tted. Th ere will be no round pegs in square holes.

**(ii) Th e worker becomes an expert:** Under division of labour, the worker repeats his task. By constant repetition he is bound to become expert in his task.

**(iii) Heavy work taken over by machinery:** Division of labour makes it possible for heavy work to be passed on to machinery. Only light work is done by the workers so that there is less strain on their muscles.

**(iv) Less training required:** As the worker has to do only a part of the job, he needs to learn only that much. Long and costly training is rendered unnecessary.

**(v) Inventions:** When a man is doing the same work over and over again some new ideas are bound to occur. Th is leads to many inventions.

**(vi) Cheaper things:** On account of mass production made possible by division of labour and the use of machinery, cheaper things are turned out. Even poor persons can buy them. Standard of living improves.

**(vii) Economy in the use of tools:** It is not necessary to provide each worker with a complete set of tools. He needs only a few tools for the job he has to do. Th ese tools are kept continuously employed. Th is is very economical.

**(viii) Saving in time:** Th e worker has no longer to move from one process to another. He is employed on the same process. He therefore, goes on working without loss of time.

Th e demerits of division of labour are as follows:

**(i) Monotony:** Doing the same work over and over again without any change produces mental fatigue. Work becomes joyless and monotonous. Th e quality of work suff ers.

**(ii) Kills the creative instinct:** Since many men contribute to the making of an article, none can say that he made it. His creative instinct is not satisfi ed. Th e work gives him no pride and no pleasure, since no worker can claim the product as his own creation.

**(iii) Loss of skill:** Th e worker deteriorates in the technical skill. Instead of making the whole article, he is required just to repeat a few simple movements. Th e skill gradually dies out.

**(iv) Checks mobility:** Th e worker is doing only a part of the job. It may not be easy for him to fi nd exactly the same job elsewhere, if he desires a change. In this way, the worker loses mobility.

**(v) Risk of unemployment:** If the worker is dismissed from one factory, then he may have to search far and wide before he secures a job in which he has specialized. He may be making only

the legs of a chair. It is doubtful if he can get the same job. On the other hand, if he knew how to make the complete chair, his chance of getting a job elsewhere would be brighter.

**(vi) Checks development of personality:** If a man has been making an eighteenth part of a pin, he becomes an eighteenth part of a man. A narrow sphere of work checks proper physical and mental development of the worker.

**(vii) Loss of sense of responsibility:** None can be held responsible for bad production because none makes the complete article. When the thing is bad, everybody tries to shift the responsibility to somebody else.

**(viii) Evils of factory system:** Division of labour give rise to the factory system which is full of evils. It leads to exploitation of women and children and removes the personal factor in production and management.

**(ix) Problem of distribution:** Under division of labour, many persons contribute to the production of an article. Th ey must receive a due share of the product, and it is not easy to determine this share. Division of labour has divided the community into two confl icting groups, that is, capital and labour. Th e gap between them is daily growing wider. Strikes and lockouts have become a common occurrence in the present day.

**(x) Dependence:** Th e dependence of one country upon another, which is the necessary consequence of division of labour, proves dangerous in times of war.

Division of labour is no doubt attended with a number of drawbacks, but the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. Division of labour is universal and found in all societies. Division of labour rules not only industry but also agriculture, art, medicine, literature, and government. Large-scale organization is essential to maintain our civilization, and so is the division of labour.

## **INSTITUTION OF THE CORPORATE BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS**

## **Character of Corporate Organization**

Th e corporate form of private business enterprise is the most important and the largest type of business group. Generally, banking, insurance, manufacture, mercantile enterprise, and air transportation are the leading business occupations that have adopted the corporate form of organization. Under this form of organization the needed capital is supplied by a number of persons who become its shareholders. Each shareholder receives his proportionate share of stock and is liable only on the value of the shares he holds. Th e general management of the corporation is delegated to a board of directors who choose the general manager—a full time offi cer of the corporation. Generally, before starting its work, the corporation has to receive a licence from the Government. It is regulated by the Company Act of the country. Th e workers generally receive a share in the profi ts of the corporation in proportion to their wages or according to some other scale. Th e bonuses, by which profi ts are distributed may be given in cash or combined with a kind of retirement pay, or may be transformed into shares of the same enterprise. Th e scheme is called profi t sharing.

Th e corporate business enterprise has many merits.

**(i)** It has eliminated competitive costs and permits the purchase of large quantities of materials at lower prices than the proprietor of the small enterprise can obtain.

**(ii)** Such enterprises permit the undertaking of vast enterprises, requiring huge wealth and extending over many years.

**(iii)** Goods are provided in large quantities so that the country does not suff er from want of goods.

**(iv)** Large units of capital bring about technological changes such as manufacture and installation of automatic machinery, development and application of electric power.

**(v)** It creates a spirit of co-operation among citizens.

Th e corporate business enterprise has some demerits also. Often big business rushes into an orgy of speculation and becomes legalized, gambling on a gigantic scale. Likewise, it may lead to overproduction, causing slump in the market. Large corporate groups become impersonal and ignore their responsibility to the people. Th ey get control over the government through their money power and pollute the democratic process. Some of them develop attitudes of economic superiority, of profi tism, of class aloofness, and of competitive shrewdness opposing needed economic reforms.

## **INSTITUTION FOR PROMOTION OF INTERESTS OF THE OCCUPATIONAL GROUPS**

With the functional specialization and interdependence of society, there have grown up numerous and powerful occupational groups. We may distinguish between two types of occupational groups, fi rst, the vocational groups, in the strict sense, which are based on the performance of a specifi c function such as trade unions and organizations of teachers, doctors, lawyers, artists and so forth; second, the groups that exist to promote the interests of an inclusive group bound together by similarity of status or functions such as chambers of commerce, rotary clubs, federations of labour unions, etc. Th ese groups are so numerous in number that each of them cannot be described separately, though they play very signifi cant roles in present day society. Here we shall limit ourselves to the study of trade unions.

## **The Trade Unions**

**Growth of trade unions:** Th e trade union is a phenomenon of the modern industrialized society. It is a group of workers engaged in a particular trade for the purpose of securing better wages, shorter hours of work, and improved conditions of labour. Th e early trade unions were regarded as being in the nature of a mutiny against their employers and masters, destructive of the discipline necessary to the expansion of trade, and interfering with the right of the employer to do what he liked with his own capital. However, little by little, the truth began to dawn on many minds that the workers had a right to unite in order to be capable of defending themselves against the capitalists and their pressure upon the Government. Th us, in modern times the trade unions are not merely tolerated but also recognized as essential in the economic structure of the country. Th eir size and number have greatly increased, and now they play a signifi cant role in the determination of wages, working hours, and conditions.

## **Aims of a Trade Union**

Th e institution of the trade union in India is primarily an economic organization organized for economic struggle. Its essential function is to strengthen the economic status of its members and

improve their working conditions. But in England and America trade union has placed before itself ambitious goals. It has become an integral part of the industrial management. Th e management has incorporated labour as an intrinsic part of the managerial apparatus rather than as individual hired hands. Th e unions have gained control or near control in many areas of industrial management.

#### **Methods of a Trade Union**

Th e methods which the trade union adopts for getting its demands accepted are various and varied. First, it believes in collective bargaining, which means that the representatives of the union meet the representatives of the employing concern and settle the terms with them regarding wage scales, hours of work, and other conditions of work. If the method of collective bargaining fails, they may opt for arbitration. Under arbitration, representatives of both the capital and labour are appointed who reach a decision by which both abide. Th e trade unions generally object to compulsory arbitration. If no decision is reached at arbitration, then the trade union resorts to strikes. Th e strike is a powerful weapon. It stops production. Th e consumers are put to diffi culties. Th e world comes to know that a group of workers is on strike and is not being fairly treated by the employer. If the strike occurs in some big, public concern like posts and telegraphs, railways, coal and steel, and the entire social life is paralysed. Th at is why the Government in India has banned strikes in essential services. In a strike, the workers lay down their tools, stop work, and walk out. If there is apprehension that the employers will bring in other workers to take their places, they resort to picketing whereby members are stationed or walk back and forth in front of the business establishment.

In recent decades, strike is said to have become a menace to the public. It causes scarcity of goods and brings starvation to the door of the poor. Th e public is put to embarrassing situations. Th e nation suff ers due to a fall in production. Strikes are harmful to the country's interests, but the question is 'how are the workers to get a redress of their grievances in the modern capitalistic age wherein the capitalists wield great infl uence in the Government?' If labour cannot strike the employers should be forbidden to exercise 'lockout'. Th e trade union is not interested in stopping the work or paralysing the economic life of the society. What it is interested in is a fair deal for its members at the hand of the employers. It asks for more pay, shorter work hours, and better conditions of work for the same reason that the capitalist always wants more profi t and more leisure. If diff erences between the labour and capital are discussed by their representatives frankly and in a friendly manner and if they have the spirit to accommodate each other not making unreasonable or impracticable demands, the labour–capital problems would be easily solved. Th e labour problems will never develop if capitalism has the social vision and the willingness to correct its own weakness.
