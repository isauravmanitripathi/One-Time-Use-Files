## **Basic Concepts**

In the previous chapter, we studied the meaning, nature, scope, and importance of sociology. Th erein we had the occasion to remark that sociology is the science of society. In the present chapter, we shall try to explain the meaning of society and other fundamental concepts used in sociology.

## **SOCIETY**

In common parlance, the word 'society' is usually used to designate the members of specifi c ingroup rather than the social relationships of those persons; for example, a Harijan society. Sometimes the word is used to designate institutions; for example, Arya Samaj (society) or Brahmo Samaj. In sociology, the term 'society' refers not to a group of people, but to the complex pattern of the norms of *interaction that arises among them.* An important aspect of the society is the system of relationships, the pattern of norms of interaction by which the members of a society maintain themselves.

Some sociologists say that society exists only when the members know each other and possess common interests or objects. Th us, if two persons are travelling in a train, their relationship of coexistence in the same compartment, of being at the same time in the same place, does not constitute society. But as soon as they come to know each other, the element of society is created. Th is idea of reciprocal awareness is implied in Giddings' defi nition of society as 'a number of like-minded individuals, who know and enjoy their like-mindedness, and are, therefore, able to work together for common ends'. But this restriction of reciprocal awareness appears to be inconvenient, since indirect and unconscious relations are of very great importance in social life.

## **Some Defi nitions of Society**

**1.** 'A society is a collection of individuals united by certain relations or modes of behaviour which mark them off from others who do not enter into these relations or who diff er from them in behaviour'. —*Ginsberg*

**2.** 'Society is not a group of people; it is the system of relationships that exists between the individuals of the group'. —*Prof Wright*

**3.** 'A society is the larger group to which any individual belongs'. —*Green*

## **Society Is a Web of Social Relationships**

According to MacIver, society is 'a web of social relationships', which may be of hundreds or thousands of types. To formulate a catalogue of social relationships will be an uphill task. Th e family alone is said to have as many as fi fteen relationships based on age, sex, and generation. Outside the family, there is no limit to the number of possible relationships. Wright says, 'Society in essence means a state or condition, a relationship, and is, therefore, necessarily an abstraction'. In the words of Reuter, 'Just as life is not a thing but a process of living so society is not a thing but a process of associating'.

## **Elements of Society**

**(a) Likeness:** It is an essential prerequisite of a society, as MacIver says, 'Society means likeness'. Th e sense of likeness was focussed in early society on kinship. In modern societies, the conditions of social likeness have broadened out in the principle of nationality or 'one world'.

**(b) Interdependence:** In addition to likeness interdependence is another essential element to constitute society. Th is fact of interdependence is very much visible in the present world. Today, not only countries but also continents depend on one another. Th e world has shrunk to such an extent that if communications are interrupted at one end, it makes all ends suff er. With the growth of the area of interdependence, its forms also multiply manifold. Th e NATO, SAARC, and UNESCO testify to the growing interdependence of the people of the world.

**(c) Co-operation:** Lastly, co-operation is also essential to constitute a society. Without co-operation no society can exist. Unless people co-operate with each other, they cannot live happily. For want of co-operation, the entire fabric of society may collapse.

Th us, likeness, interdependence, and co-operation are the essential elements to constitute a society. Besides these elements, MacIver has also mentioned some other elements of society when he defi nes it as a system of usages and procedures, authority, and mutual aid, of many groupings and divisions, of controls of human behaviour, and of liberties. Th is defi nition contains seven elements of society. First, in every society there are some usages concerned with marriage, education, religion, food, and speech, etc. that diff er from society to society. Second, there are procedures, that is, the modes of action in every society that maintain its unity and organization. Th ird, the presence of an authority is necessary to maintain order in a society. Fourth, no society can be stable unless there is a feeling of mutual aid among its members. Fifth, in a society there are several groupings and divisions such as family, village, and city. Sixth, controls are necessary for the organization of society. Seventh, liberty and control go together in a society. Without liberty man cannot develop his personality. Control on an individual's behaviour is not meant to destroy his liberty, but to promote and protect it.

It may, however, be noted that society involves more a state or quality of mind than a mere structure. Th e beings who constitute a society must realize their likeness and their interdependence. Th ey must have a community of feeling. Society is not a mere agency for the comfort of the beings, but it is the whole system of social relationships.

It may also be mentioned that society is a permanent institution. Its origin goes back to the dawn of history and stretches to those remote corners of the planet where people are living together. It is a kind of natural organization that has emerged out of the natural instincts of man. Th at is why Aristotle said that 'man by nature is a social animal'. So long as man possesses instinct of sociability, society will continue to exist.

## **COMMUNITY**

MacIver defi nes community as 'an area of social living marked by some degree of social coherence'. He further says, 'Whenever the members of any group, small or large, live together in such a way that they share, not this or that particular interest, but the basic conditions of a common life, we call that group a community'. We know that a person rarely exists alone. He is linked in many ways to his fellows who form a group. We cannot, however, expect a man to become the member of all the groups existing in the world. He can establish his relations only with the people who reside near him in a defi nite part of the territory. It is inevitable that people, who over any length of time, reside in a particular locality should develop social likeness, should have common social ideas, common traditions, and the sense of belonging together. Th is fact of social living and common specifi c area give birth to community.

#### **Some Defi nitions of Community**

**(a)** 'Community is a human population living within a limited geographic area and carrying on a common interdependent life'. —*Lundberg*

**(b)** 'Community is a social group with some degree of "we feeling" and "living in a given area".' —*Bogardus*

**(c)** 'Community is a group of people living in a contiguous geographic area, having common centres of interests and activities, and functioning together in the chief concerns of life'.

—*Osborne and Neumeyer*

**(d)** 'Community is the total organisation of social life with a limited area'.

—*Ogburn and Nimkoff* 

**(e)** 'Community is the smallest territorial group that can embrace all aspects of social life'. —*Kingsley Davis*

**(f)** 'Community is a cluster of people, living within a contiguous small area, who share a common way of life'. — *Green, Arnold*

#### **Elements of a Community**

Th e following are the elements on the basis of which we can decide whether a particular group is a community or not:

**(a) Group of people:** Community is a group of people. Whenever the individuals live together in such a way that they share the basic conditions of a common life, we call them forming a community.

**(b) Locality:** Th e group of people forms a community when it begins to reside in a defi nite locality. A community always occupies a territorial area. Th e area need not be fi xed for ever. Th e people may change their area of habitation from time to time just as nomadic community does. However, most communities are now well settled and derive a strong bond of solidarity from the conditions of their locality. Among the village people there is unity because they reside in a defi nite locality. Although due to the extending facilities of communication in the modern world the territorial bond has been weakened, yet the character of locality as a social classifi er has never been transcended.

**(c) Community sentiment:** Community sentiment means a feeling of belonging together. It is 'we feeling' among the members. In modern times, this sentiment very much lacks among the people occupying a specifi c local area. For example, in big cities, a man does not know even his next-door neighbour. Mere neighbourhood does not create a community if community sentiment is lacking. Th erefore, to create a community the sentiment of common living must be present among the residents of a locality.

**(d) Permanency:** A community is not transitory like a crowd. It essentially includes a permanent life in a defi nite place.

**(e) Naturality:** Communities are not made or created by an act of will, but are natural. An individual is born in a community.

**(f) Likeness:** In a community, there is a likeness in language, customs, mores, etc. According to Green, 'A community is a cluster of people living within a narrow territorial radius, who share a common way of life'.

**(g) Wider ends:** In communities, the people associate not for the fulfi lment of a particular end. Th e ends of a community are wider. Th ese are natural and not artifi cial.

**(h) A particular name:** Every community has a particular name. In the words of Lumley, 'It points identity, it indicates reality; it points out individuality; it often describes personality and each community is something of a personality'. For example, people living in Punjab are called Punjabis, whereas those living in Kashmir are called Kashmiris.

**(i) No legal status:** A community does not have a legal status. It cannot sue, nor can it be sued. In the eyes of law, it has no rights and duties.

## **Size of Community**

A community may be big or small. A big community such as a nation contains a number of small communities and groups with closer bonds of unity and numerous common qualities. Today, eff orts are being made to extend the limits of community so as to include the whole earth and create a one world community.

## **Diff erence Between a Community and a Society**

Th e following are the points of diff erence between a society and a community:

**(a) Community sentiment:** A community, as discussed above, is a group of people who live together in particular locality and share the basic conditions of a common life. To constitute a community the presence of common sentiment is necessary. On the other hand, there is an

 element of likeness in society, but it is not necessary that likeness should include the people in oneness; enemies can also be included in society.

**(b) Defi nite locality:** Society has no defi nite boundary or assignable limits. It is universal and pervasive. Society is the name of our social relationships. Community, on the other hand, is a group of people living together in a particular locality.

**(c) Community a species of society:** Community is the species of society. It exists within a society and possesses its distinguishable structure that distinguishes it from other communities. Small communities exist within greater communities; the village within a town, the town within a region, the region within a nation.

**(d) Community is concrete, whereas society is abstract:** Society is a network of social relationships that cannot be seen or touched. It is an abstract concept. On the other hand, community is a concrete concept. It is a group of people living in a particular locality and having a feeling of oneness. We can see this group and locate its existence.

## **ASSOCIATION**

An association is a group of people organized for a particular purpose or a limited number of purposes. According to MacIver, 'an association is an organisation deliberately formed for the collective pursuit of some interest or set of interests, which its members share'. According to Ginsberg, 'an association is a group of social beings related to one another by the fact that they possess or have instituted in common an organisation with a view to securing a specifi c end or specifi c ends'. G. D. H. Cole writes, 'By an association I mean any group of persons pursuing a common purpose by a course of cooperative action extending beyond a single act, and, for this purpose, agreeing together upon certain methods of procedure and laying down, in however rudimentary a form, rules of common action'. According to Bogardus, 'Association is usually a working together of people to achieve some purposes'. To constitute an association, there must be (a) a group of people, (b) these people must be organized, that is, there must be certain rules for their conduct in the group, and (c) they must have a common purpose of specifi c nature to pursue.

Th us, family, church, trade union, music club all are the instances of association. Associations may be formed on several bases.

**(a)** On the basis of duration, that is, temporary or permanent. For example, Flood Relief Association, which is temporary and state, which is permanent.

**(b)** On the basis of power, that is, sovereign (state), semi-sovereign (university), and non-sovereign (clubs).

**(c)** On the basis of function, that is, biological (family), vocational (Trade Union or Teachers' association), recreational (tennis club or music club), and philanthropic (charitable societies).

#### **Diff erence Between Society and Association**

Th e following are the points of diff erence between society and association:

**(a) Society is older than association:** Society is older than association, and is in existence since man appeared on the earth, whereas association arose at a later stage when man learnt to organize himself for the pursuit of some particular purpose.

**(b) Th e aim of society is general:** Th e aim of society is general, whereas that of association is particular. Society comes into existence for the general well-being of the individuals. An association is formed for the pursuit of some particular purpose or purposes.

**(c) Society may be organized or unorganized:** Society may be organized or unorganized, but association must be organized.

**(d) Membership of society is compulsory:** Th e membership of a society is rather compulsory, as no man, unless he is either a beast or a God, can live without it. On the other hand, man may live without being a member of any association at all. Society will exist as long as man exists, but association may be transitory.

**(e) Society is marked by both co-operation and confl ict, whereas association is based on cooperation alone:** An association marked by intra-confl ict will not survive.

**(f) Society is a system of social relationships, whereas association is a group of people:** Society lays emphasis on relationships, association lays emphasis on groupness.

**(g) Society is natural, whereas association is artifi cial:** Association is formed by the people for a particular purpose or purposes.

## **Diff erence Between Association and Community**

An association is not a community, but a group within a community. Th e following are the points of diff erence between the two:

**(a) An association is partial, whereas a community is a whole:** An association is formed for the achievement of some specifi c purpose which does not include the whole purposes of life. It pursues, in a defi nite way, a defi nite number of purposes. However important these purposes may be, they do not embrace the totality of ends or purposes. A community, on the other hand, includes the whole circle of common life. It does not exist for the pursuit of special interests. It is not deliberately created. It has no beginning, no hour of birth. It is simply the whole circle of common life, more comprehensive, more spontaneous than any association.

**(b) Association exists within community:** Association is formed by the individuals for the pursuit of the individual interest. Th ere are a number of associations within a community. Association is not a community, but it is an organization within the community.

**(c) Association is an artifi cial creation, whereas community is a natural growth:** An association is deliberately created by some individuals for realising a specifi c purpose. Community is not created, but it grows out of community sentiment. It has no burning, no hour of birth. It is spontaneous.

**(d) Membership of an association has limited signifi cance, whereas the membership of a community has wider connotation:** An association is a transitory group of people who unite together to pursue a common purpose. It has signifi cance for a member as long only as it serves his purpose. He is free to disown it any time. Th e political leaders change their party as soon as it ceases to serve their interest. Th ere are no natural bonds between them and their political organizations. Community, on the other hand, embraces the whole purpose of life. It does not exist for the pursuit of some specifi c purpose. It is more comprehensive, more signifi cant than any association.

**(e) Th e membership of an association is voluntary, but the membership of a community is compulsory:** We are born into communities, but we choose our associations.

**(f) Community sentiment is an essential feature of community, but not of association:**Th ere can be no community without 'we feeling'.

**(g) Associations have offi ces:** An association has got its offi ce bearers who manage its aff airs, but an offi ce is not necessary to constitute a community.

**(h) A community works through customs and traditions, whereas an association works mostly through written laws and rules:** Th e constitution of an association is generally written. It has a legal status.

It may, however, be remembered that association may become communities by serving plurality of ends, though that may never be reached. Th us, the so-called communities, which give rise to the problem of communalism, may not be called communities in the sociological sense. Th ey are rather racial or religious groups.

## **CULTURE**

Culture has been defi ned in a number of ways; some thinkers include in culture all the major social components that bind men together in a society. Others take a narrow view and include in culture only the non-material parts. Some of the defi nitions are as follows:

**(a)** 'Culture is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities acquired by man as a member of society'. —*Tylor*

**(b)** 'Culture is the handiwork of man and the medium through which he achieves his ends'. —*Malinowski*

**(c)** 'Culture is an organised body of conventional understanding manifest in art and artifact, which, persisting through tradition, characterises a human group'. —*Redfi eld*

**(d)** 'Culture is an accumulation of thoughts, values, and objects; it is the social heritage acquired by us from preceding generations through learning, as distinguished from the biological heritage which is passed on to us automatically through the genes'. —*Graham Wallas*

**(e)** 'Culture is the socially transmitted system of idealised ways in knowledge, practice, and belief, along with the artifacts that knowledge and practice produce and maintain as they change in time'. —*Arnold W. Green*

**(f)** 'Culture is the embodiment in customs, tradition, etc., of the learning of a social group over the generation'. —*Lapiere*

**(g)** 'Culture is the expression of our nature in our modes of living and thinking our everyday intercourse, in art, in literature, in religion, in recreation and enjoyment'. —*MacIver*

**(h)** 'Culture refers to the social mechanisms of behaviour and to the physical and symbolic products of these behaviours'. —*Lundberg*

**(i)** 'Culture is the sum total of integrated learned behaviour patterns which are characteristics of the members of a society and which are, therefore, not the result of biological inheritance'.

—*E. A. Hoebel*

**(j)** 'Culture is the sum total of human achievements, material as well as non-material, capable of transmission, sociologically, that is, by tradition and communication, vertically as well as horizontally'. —*H. T. Mazumdar*

From the above definitions it is clear that in sociology, culture is used in a specific sense that is different from the one we have in common parlance. People often call an educated person a cultured man and regard an uneducated person as uncultured. In sociology, we use the word to denote acquired behaviours, which are shared by and transmitted among the members of the society. It is an accumulation that a new generation inherits. It is a heritage into which a child is born. Thus, to a student of sociology, a person lacking in culture is an impossibility because individuals share the culture of their group. The essential point in regard to culture is that it is acquired by man as a member of society and persists through tradition. These points of acquisition and tradition have been emphasized by Tylor and Redfield in their definitions. The essential factor in this acquisition through tradition is the ability to learn from the group. Man learns his behaviour, and behaviour which is learnt denotes his culture. Singing, talking, dancing, and eating belong to the category of culture. Moreover, the behaviours are not one's own, but are shared by others. Behaviours are transmitted to a person by someone; be it his school teacher, his parents, or friends. It is the product of human experience, that is, it is man-made. It is the sum of what the group has learnt about living together under particular circumstances, physical and biological, in which it has found itself. Thus*, culture is a system of learnt behaviour, shared by and transmitted among the members of a group.* Man begins to learn it since his birth. By picking up the culture and by tapping the heritage of his past, man becomes distinctively human. Man has, therefore, been called the culture-bearing animal.

Now, we may point out to the following characteristics of culture:

**(a) Culture is an acquired quality:** Culture is not innate. Traits learnt through socialization, habits, and thoughts are called culture. Culture is learnt. Any behaviour which is socially acquired is called learnt behaviour.

**(b) Culture is social, not individual heritage of man:** Culture is inclusive of the expectations of the members of the group. It is a social product which is shared by most members of the group.

**(c) Culture is idealistic:** Culture embodies the ideas and norms of a group. It is a sum total of the ideal patterns and norms of behaviour of a group. It is the manifestation of human mind in the course of history.

**(d) Culture is the total social heritage:** Culture is linked with the past. Th e past endures because it lives in culture. It is passed from one generation to another through traditions and customs.

**(e) Culture fulfi ls some needs:** Culture fulfi ls those ethical and social needs of the groups that are ends in themselves.

**(f) Culture is an integrated system:** Culture possesses an order and system. Its various parts are integrated with each other and any new element that is introduced is also integrated.

**(g) Language is the chief vehicle of culture:** Man lives not only in the present but also in the past and future. Th is is made possible because of language that transmits to him what was learnt in the past and enables him to transmit the accumulated wisdom to future.

**(h) Culture evolves into more complex forms through division of labour:** which develops special skills and increases the interdependence of society's members.

## **Functions of Culture**

We may consider the functions of culture under two categories:

- **(a)** For an individual
- **(b)** For a group

#### **Importance for an Individual**

Culture has got a great value for an individual. It forms an important element of his social life. Th e following advantages of culture for an individual may be pointed out.

**(a) Culture makes man a human being:** It is culture that makes the human animal a man, regulates his conduct, and prepares him for group life. It provides to him a complete design for living. It teaches him what type of food he should take and in what manner, how he should cover himself and behave with his fellow beings, how he should speak with the people, and how he should·cooperate or compete with others. An individual abstracted from culture is less than human; he is what we call a feral man. Th e individual, to be truly human, must participate in the cultural stream. Just as it is necessary for fi sh to live in water, it is necessary and natural for man to live within a cultural framework. In short, the qualities required to live a social life are acquired by man from his culture. Without it he would have been forced to fi nd his own way, which would have meant a loss of energy in satisfying his elementary needs.

**(b) Culture provides solutions for complicated situations:** Culture has so thoroughly infl uenced man that often no external force is needed to keep him in conformity with the social requirements. Actions in certain situations become automatic; for example, forming a queue when there is rush at a booking window or driving left in busy streets. In the absence of culture, there would have been confusions even in the simplest of situations; for example, there would have been numerous problems even in deciding what food to eat. Today, there is no need to go through a trial and error process to learn everything. A readymade set of patterns is known for all the matters, which only needs to be learnt and followed. Horton and Hunt write, 'From before he is born until after he is dead, man is a prisoner of his culture. His culture directs and confi nes his behaviour, limits his goals, and measures his rewards. His culture gets into his mind and shutters his vision so that he sees what he is supposed to see, dreams what he is expected to dream, and hungers for what he is trained to hunger. He may imagine that he is making choices, or that he rules his destiny, but the choices of the normal person always fall within a series of possibilities which the culture tolerates'.

**(c) Culture provides traditional interpretations to certain situations:** Th rough culture, man gets traditional interpretations of many situations according to which he determines his behaviour. If a cat crosses his way he postpones the journey. If an owl is seen at the top of the house, it is regarded inauspicious. It may, however, be noted that these traditional interpretations diff er from culture to culture. Among some culture, the owl is regarded a symbol of wisdom and not a symbol of idiocy.

#### **Importance for a Group**

**(a) Culture keeps social relationships intact:** Culture has importance not only for man but also for the group. Had there been no culture there would have been no group life. Culture is the design and the prescription, the composite of guiding values and ideals. By regulating the behaviour of the people and satisfying their primary drives pertaining to hunger, shelter, and sex, it has been able to maintain group life. Indeed, life would have been poor, nasty, brutish, and short if there had been no cultural regulations. People behave the way in society because their behaviour does not meet with social disapproval. Culture has provided a number of checks on irrational conduct and suggestibility. Cultural aids such as schooling or scientifi c training lessen the chances that a man will behave irrationally or irresponsibly. Th e members of the group characterized though they be by a consciousness of kind, are at once competing with one another for the good things of this life and for status. Th ey are held in line by constraints prescribed by culture. So, it is culture that has kept social relationships intact. Group solidarity rests on the foundation of culture.

**(b) Culture broadens the vision of the individual:** Culture has given a new vision to man by providing him a set of rules for the co-operation of the individuals. He thinks not only for his own self but also for others. Culture teaches him to think of himself as a part of the larger whole. It provides him with the concepts of family, state, nation, and class and makes possible the coordination and division of labour. Culture creates *esprit de corps* in man*.*

**(c) Culture creates new needs:** Culture also creates new needs and new drives; for example, it leads to a thirst for knowledge. It satisfi es the aesthetic, moral, and religious interests of the members of the group. In this way, groups also owe much to culture. Any change in cultural valuations will have wide repercussions on the personality of the individual and structure of the group.

To conclude, the Indian culture is composite in character that exhibits a synthesis of Hindu and Islamic traditions. India has witnessed one of the most extensive experiments in cultural cross-fertilization spanning over fi ve millennia. Th e Hindus visit Muslim shrines and likewise the Hindu places of pilgrimage are visited by Muslims. Th e Sufi s drew Muslims and Hindus to their fold with their message of love, compassion, and brotherhood. Th e Indian culture transcends narrow religious and sectarian attitudes as is evident in music, literature, and art. Despite increased communal polarization, India's composite culture has not lost its vitality.

## **SOCIALIZATION**

## **Meaning of Socialization**

According to Kimball Young, 'Socialisation means the process of inducting the individual into the social and cultural world; of making him a particular member in society and its various groups and inducting him to accept the norms and values of that society'.

Socialization is defi nitely a matter of learning and not of biological inheritance. It is through the process of socialization that a newborn is moulded into a social being and fi nds fulfi lment within the society. Man becomes what he is by socialization. According to Ogburn, 'Socialisation is the process by which the individual learns to conform to the norms of the group'.

According to Lundberg, 'socialisation consists of the complex processes of interaction through which the individual learns the habits, skills, beliefs and standards of judgement that are necessary for his eff ective participation in social group and communities'. 'Socialisation is a learning that enables the learner to perform social roles'. According to Green, 'Socialisation is the process by which the child acquires a cultural content, along with selfhood and personality'. Socialization transforms an individual into a person. It is a process of adjustment to social norms and modes of living.

## **Agencies of Socialization**

Th e process of socialization is operative not only in childhood but throughout life. It is a process that begins at birth and continues unceasingly until the death of the individual. It is an incessant process.

Th e chief agencies of socialization are the following:

**(a) Th e family:** Th e parents and family are the fi rst agency of socialization for the child. Th e child learns speech and language from parents. In the family, he learns a number of civic virtues. Th e family is rightly called the 'cradle of social virtues'. Th e child gets his fi rst lessons in cooperation, tolerance, self-sacrifi ce, love, and aff ection in the family. Th e environment of a family infl uences the growth of a child. Th e psychologists have shown that a person is what he becomes in a family. In a bad family, the child learns bad habits, whereas in a good family he acquires good habits.

**(b) Th e school:** Th e school is the second agency of socialization. In the school, the child gets his education which moulds his ideas and attitudes. Education is of great importance in socialization. A well-planned system of education can produce socialized persons.

**(c) Playmates or friends:** Playmates and friends are also an important agency of socialization. Th e relation between the child and his playmates is one of equality. From them he acquires co-operative morality and some of the informal aspects of culture such as fashions, fads, crazes, modes of gratifi cation, and forbidden knowledge.

**(d) Th e church:** Religion has been an important factor in society. In every family, religious practices are observed on diff erent occasions. Th e child observes his parents going to the temple and performing religious ceremonies. He listens to religious sermons, which may determine his course of life and shape his ideas.

**(e) Th e State:** Th e state is an authoritarian agency. It makes laws for the people and lays down the modes of conduct expected of them. If they fail to adjust their behaviour in accordance with the laws of the state, they may be punished. Th us, the state also moulds our behaviour.

One of the reasons for the increasing crime in society is the failure of the socializing agencies to properly and adequately socialize the child. Today, modern families face a crisis and suff er from parental maladjustment, which adversely aff ects the process of socialization. Th e educational system is full of drawbacks. Th e school is no longer a temple of education. It is a place where boys and girls learn more about drugs and alcohol and less about cultural heritage. Th e onslaught of urbanization has abolished the neighbourhood system and snatched playmates from the child, who now plays with electronic games than with the neighbourhood children. Similarly, religion has a lesser hold in an urban society and state authority is more disobeyed than obeyed.

It need not be said that in order to have socialized beings these agencies should function in an effi cient manner. Th e modern society has to solve several problems of socialization, and for that purpose it has to make these agencies more active and eff ective.

## **SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION**

'Social structure' is a basic concept in sociology. Since long, several eff orts have been made to defi ne social structure; still there is no unanimity of opinion on its defi nition. Herbert Spencer was the fi rst thinker to throw light on the structure of society, but he could not give a clear-cut defi nition. Durkheim also made a futile eff ort to defi ne it. Some defi nitions of social structure are as follows:

**(a)** 'Social structure is the term applied to the particular arrangement of the interrelated institutions, agencies and social patterns, as well as the statuses and roles which each person assumes in the groups'. —*Talcott Parsons*

**(b)** 'Social structure is concerned with the principal forms of social organisation, that is, types of groups, associations and institutions, and the complex of these which constitute societies'. —*Ginsberg*

**(c)** 'Th e various modes of grouping together comprise the complex pattern of social structure. In the analysis of the social structure the role of diverse attitudes and interests of social beings is revealed'. —*MacIver*

On the basis of the above defi nitions it may be said that social structure is an abstract phenomenon. It refers to the external aspects of a society. Its units are groups, institutions, associations, and organizations. As we know, man is a social animal & lives in society. Each society has a pattern of organization composed of the structures resulting from the associations of men with each other. When men relate themselves to each other they establish a structural form. It may be a group, an association, or an organization. Th e social structure is made up of these structural forms that are arranged in an interrelated way to enable the society to function in a harmonious manner.

 Th e meaning of social structure can be easily understood if we take the example of organic structure. Th e human body is an arrangement of diff erent parts such as hands, legs, mouth, nose, ears, etc. Th ese parts are arranged in a particular and systematic way so as to create a pattern. Th e body works through these parts that are interdependent and interrelated. Although the diff erent parts of the organic structure are the same in every case, yet the form of organic structure of the people diff ers. Some are longer, some are short, some are fat, and some are lean and thin. Similar is the case with social structure. Th e parts of all the social structures are the same, that is, every social structure has a family, religion, political organization, economic institutions, land area, etc. But the forms of social structure diff er; for example, the form of family is not similar in all the social structures. Some families have one husband, one wife, and their children. Others families have several wives, one husband, and their children. Th us, the parts of social structures being the same, their specifi c forms vary. It may, therefore, be concluded that social structure is a patterned arrangement of human relationships. Th ese structures are (a) ecological entities, (b) human groups, (c) institutional agencies (d) organizations, and (e) collectivities.

## **SOCIAL SYSTEM**

Th e concept of social system like social structure has got an important place. Every society or group has a system. Without a system no unit can function properly.

## **Meaning of System**

In simple words, system is an orderly arrangement. We can fi nd an example of a system in the human body. Th ere are various parts of a human body such as ears, eyes, nose, legs, hands, lungs, stomach, heart, brain, etc. Th ese parts have their own fi xed places and are arranged in a particular manner which is known as 'organic structure'. Each part of the structure has a particular function to perform.

On the basis of these functions, they are interrelated with each other and interact with one another. Th is inspect of organic structure is known as 'organic system'. Th us, the word 'system' signifi es patterned relationship among the constituent parts of the structure which makes these parts active and binds them together.

In brief, the main features of a system are as follows:

**(a)** A system is made of diff erent parts which together constitute a system.

**(b)** A mere collection of parts does not make a system. Th ese parts must be arranged in a systematic manner.

**(c)** Th e arrangement of these parts should create a pattern.

 Th e parts of a watch should be so arranged that they may create a specifi c pattern called a watch. It is this pattern that distinguishes a watch from a bicycle, although in both there is an arrangement of parts.

**(d)** Th ere is functional relationship among the parts of a system. Each part has got a function to perform. Th e system is related with every part and every part is related to the system; for example, the cycle wheel in order to move must be related to the free wheel, chain, etc.

**(e)** Th e plurality of parts creates unity. Although the parts perform diff erent functions, yet they are functionally related in such a way as to create a new entity. In a fountain pen, there is a nib, tube, body, clip, etc. Th e assembly of these parts in a systematic way makes a fountain pen. In a system the parts do 'not lose their existence'. Th ey continue to exist and perform their specifi c functions. It may also be noted that a defect in any part may aff ect the working of the system.

## **Meaning of Social System**

A social system is an orderly and systematic arrangement of social interactions. It may be defi ned as a 'plurality of individuals interacting with each other according to shared cultural norms and meanings'. Th e parts of a social system are individuals. Each individual has a role to play. He participates in interactive relationship. He infl uences the behaviour of other individuals and is infl uenced by their behaviour. Th e behaviour of individuals and groups in a society is controlled by social institutions. Th ey act in accordance with social norms. On the basis of their interactions and interrelationship they create a pattern which is called social system.

## **Characteristics of a Social System**

**(a)** Social system is based on social interaction: Social system is based on the interaction of plurality of individuals. When a number of individuals act and interact, their interactions produce a system which is called social system.

**(b)** Th e human interactions create social relationships: Th e social relationships fi nd expression in traditions, customs, mores, laws, procedures, institutions, etc. Social system is the orderly arrangement of the various expressions of social relationships.

**(c)** Th e parts of social system are related on the basis of functional relationship: In a social system each part has an assigned role and performs it in accordance with the established procedures and norms. Th e diff erent parts are united to each other on the basis of functional relationship.

**(d)** Social system is related with cultural system: Social system is closely related with cultural system. Culture determines the nature and scope of interrelations and interactions of the members of society. It not only determines their interrelations and interactions but also maintains a balance and harmonious relationship among the diff erent parts.

**(e)** Social system has an environmental aspect: A social system is related to a particular age, a defi nite territory and a particular society. It means that social system is not the same in all age groups, territories, and societies. Th ere are diff erent social systems for diff erent ages and territories. In other words, social system changes with the change in times. It is dynamic not static. In some societies, social system changes more rapidly than in other societies. But this change does not mean that social equilibrium is lost. It may, of course, be disturbed for sometime. In spite of social changes, social system continues to exist. Th ere have been several changes in the roles of husband and wife, norms have changed, yet family system has not come to an end. Social system has the quality of self-adjustment.

## **Relationship Between Social Structure and Social System**

Th e two concepts of social structure and social system are closely related to each other. Social system relates to the functional aspect of social structure. Both social structure and social system go together. Social structure is the means through which social system functions. Th e value of any structure depends on the manner in which it accomplishes its functions. When a social structure does not function properly, we try to modify it; for example, if the family does not accomplish its purpose, we modify it. In place of polygamous family, we may have monogamous family. Th e educational system may be modifi ed if it fails to accomplish the purpose of education. Structure is useless without function, and function is only accomplished through structure. In short, social structure and social system go together.

Th ere is another aspect of the relationship between social structure and social system. Th e nature of functions to be carried out infl uences the form of structure. And the form of structure will infl uence the functions it can perform. Th us, if we want our social system to function in a democratic way, the parts of social structure will have to be organized on a democratic basis. Th e state cannot function democratically unless its structure is democratic, or to put it in other words, if our state is dictatorial in its structure, it will function in a dictatorial manner. Th e traditional family is unsuited to modem needs. Hence, there is a change in the structure of family in modern times. A rigid social structure may fail to meet the needs of a changing society.

## **NORMS AND VALUES**

## **Meaning of Values**

In sociology, our concern is with social values. Social values are cultural standards that indicate the general good deemed desirable for organized social life. Th ese are assumptions of what is right and important for a society. A social value diff ers from an individual value. An individual value is enjoyed or sought by the individual that he seeks for himself. As distinct from individual values, a social value contains a concern for others' welfare. Social values regulate the thoughts and behaviour of the people. Th e process of socialization aims to include these values in an individual's personality; the ethos or fundamental characteristics of any culture are a refl ection of its basic values. Th us, if

the American culture is dominated by a belief in material progress, the Indian culture is marked by spiritualism, abandonment of personal desire, and elimination of the ambition. Th e 'Indian way' is diff erent from the 'American way'.

Th e diff erences in social values result in divergent social structures and patterns of expected behaviour.

### **Meaning of Norms**

**(a) Norms are standards of group behaviour:** An essential characteristic of group life is that it possesses a set of values that regulates the behaviour of individual members. Th ese standards of group behaviour are called social norms. Th at brothers and sisters should not have sexual relations and a child should defer to his parents are the illustrations of norms which govern the relationships among kinsmen.

**(b) Norms incorporate value judgements:** Secord and Bukman say, 'A norm is a standard of behaviour expectation shared by group members against which the validity of perceptions is judged and the appropriateness of feeling and behaviour is evaluated'. Members of a group exhibit certain regularities in their behaviour. Th is behaviour is considered desirable by the group. Such regularities in behaviour have been explained in terms of social norms. Norm, in popular usage, means a standard. In sociology, our concern is with social norms, that is, norms accepted in a group. Th us, it may be said that norms are based on social values that are justifi ed by moral standards or aesthetic judgement. A norm is a pattern, setting limits on individual behaviour. As defi ned by Broom and Selznick, 'Th e norms are blue prints for behaviour setting limits within which individuals may seek alternate way and to achieve their goals'. Norms do not refer to an average or central tendency of human beings. Th ey denote expected behaviour, or even ideal behaviour. Moral values are attached to them. Th ey are model practices. Th ey set out the normative order of the group.

#### **Importance of Norms**

**(a) A normless society is an impossibility:** Norms are of great importance to the society. It is impossible to imagine a normless society, because without norms behaviour would be unpredictable. Th e standards of behaviour contained in the norms give order to social relations. Interaction goes smoothly if the individuals follow the group norms.

**(b) Norms give cohesion to society:** We can hardly think of a human group without norms. A group without norms would be—using the words of Hobbes—'solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short'. Human being, in order to maintain itself, must live in a normatively regulated social system.

**(c) Norms infl uence individual's attitudes:** Norms infl uence an individual's attitudes and his motives. An individual becomes a good member if he abides by the norms.

## **Conformity of Norms**

Norms are not formed by all groups in relation to every kind of behaviour and every possible situation. Th e scope of behaviour regulated by norms varies considerably in diff erent groups. For example, the norms of some groups may pertain chiefl y to ethical matters, whereas the norms of other groups may cover a broader area of life including dress, forms of entertainment, education, and so on.

Furthermore, a social norm operative in one social system may not be operative in another. Th us, Mohammedan societies permit polygyny, but Christian ones do not.

A norm by defi nition implies a sense of obligation. It lays down a standard of behaviour which one ought to follow. Conformity to norms is normal. Th e individual having internalized the norms, feels a need to conform to the norms. His conscience would bother him if he did not. Furthermore, people will disapprove his action if he violates the norms. Th us, both internalized need and external sanctions play an eff ective role in bringing about conformity to norms.

## **Confl ict in Norms**

Since there are diff erent norms for diff erent groups, a confl ict among them is inevitable.

**(a)** Some norms are perceived less important than others, and so the less important ones are violated when one has to make a choice between the two norms. In this case, it may be said that strictly speaking there is confl ict because the relative importance of the norms is clear.

**(b)** Norms may so confl ict with each other that an individual must disobey one if he is to conform to the other. A student who sees a friend cheating in an examination must choose between confl icting norms. One norm instructs him to be loyal to his friend, whereas another instructs him to see that honesty is upheld.

**(c)** An individual may deviate from a norm because he knows it is weakly enforced. Using college stationery for personal use is rarely punished.

**(d)** Some norms are not learnt by all persons even in the same society. For example, there are wide diff erences in lifestyles, food habits, and etiquettes of the people within the same society.

It may not, however, be supposed that individual resistance to norms necessarily threatens them or shakes the solidarity of the group. But when large numbers of people resist the norms and evade them over long periods, they are weakened and group is shaken. However, some norms may be so important that they persist in spite of deviations. We know that the norms regarding sex behaviour are often evaded, but it is unlikely that these deviations will change the sex norms. In spite of the fact that there are confl icts between norms and there are deviations from norms, they have, nevertheless, evolved as part of human society because they helped to satisfy the fundamental, social, and individual needs, thus, enabling societies and the human species to survive.

## **DEVIANCE**

## **Meaning of Deviance**

An essential feature of social life is that it possesses a set of norms that regulates the behaviour of the individual members. All societies provide for certain standards of human behaviour. Th ese standards of behaviour are called norms. But no society completely succeeds in getting all its members to behave in accordance with the social norms. Some of them fail to conform to these norms. Failure to conform to the customary norms of society is deviant behaviour or deviance. Th us, deviant behaviour is any behaviour that fails to conform to some specifi ed standard. Deviant behaviour disturbs the social equilibrium. It is contravention of the social norms. It is a departure from the usual modes of behaviour. It consists of disapproved activities. Cheating, unfairness, malingering, delinquency, immorality, dishonesty, betrayal, corruption, wickedness, and sin are examples of deviant behaviour.

Th e delinquent, the saint, the ascetic, the hippie, the leader, the miser all have deviated from conventional social norms.

**Anomie:** Anomie is a condition of normlessness. By normlessness we do not mean that modern societies have no norms; instead it means that they have many sets of norms with none of them clearly binding upon everybody. Th e individual does not know which norm to follow, whether to follow the norms of the family or of the school. Anomie thus arises from the confusion and confl ict of norms. People in the modern society move about too rapidly to be bound to the norms of any particular group. In traditional societies, people were guided by coherent set of traditions, which they followed with little deviation. But the modem society lacks coherent traditions; diff erent groupings having diff erent norms. Th e society provides man with no guide. Consequently, his behaviour lacks consistency and conforms to no dependable norm. According to Durkheim, 'When there is a sudden change, the normative structure of the regulating norms of society is slackened, hence, man does not know what is wrong or what is right, his impulses are excessive; to satisfy them, he seeks anomie'. In the words of Merton, 'Anomie may be conceived as breakdown in the cultural structure occurring particularly when there is an acute distinction between cultural norms and goals and the socially structured capacities of members of the group to act in accord with them'. According to him, there is in our social structure 'a strain towards anomie'. Th e degree of anomie may range from slight contradiction and confusion to serious deterioration and disintegration.

## **SOCIAL GROUPS**

#### **Meaning of Group**

Social group is a collection of human beings. Some of its defi nitions are as follows:

**(a)** 'A social group may be thought of as a number of persons, two or more, who have some common objects of attention, who are stimulating to each other, who have common loyalty, and participate in similar activities'.—*Bogardus*

**(b)** 'Whenever two or more individuals come together and infl uence one another, they may be said to constitute a social group'.—*Ogburn* and *Nimkoff* 

**(c)** 'A social group may be defi ned as two or more persons who are in communication over an appreciable period of time and who act in accordance with a contact, function or purpose'.— *Eldredge* and *Merrill*

As discussed, social relationships involve some degree of reciprocity between the related and some degree of mutual awareness. A social group is an organized group, that is, certain rules and statues control social relationships within it; some of its members lead, whereas others follow. Th e members of a social group need not have close physical or social contact, but the awareness of common membership is absolutely necessary for a group to exist.

#### **Characteristics of Social Group**

From the defi nitions of social group given above the following characteristics may be pointed out:

**(a) Reciprocal relations:** Th e members of a group are interrelated to each other.

**(b) Sense of unity:** Th e members of a group are united by a sense of unity and a feeling of sympathy.

**(c) We-feeling:** Th e members of a group help each other and defend their interests collectively.

**(d) Common interests:** Th e interests and ideals of a group are common. It is for the realization of common interests that they meet together.

**(e) Similar behaviour:** Th e members of a group behave in a similar way for the pursuit of common interests.

**(f) Group Norms:** Every group has its own rules or norms, which the members are supposed to follow.

## **Classifi cation of Groups**

Social groups have been classifi ed in various ways. While some thinkers have given a simple classifi cation, others have given an elaborate classifi catory scheme.

**(a)** Th e German sociologist Simmel considered size as a criterion for classifying groups. Since a person, that is, an individual with his societal conditionings is the most elementary unit of sociology, so he began with the 'nomad'—the single person—as a focus of group relationships and pursued his analysis through the 'dyad', the 'triad', and the other smaller collectivities on the one hand and the large scale groups on the other'.

**(b)** Dwight Sanderson suggested a three-fold classifi cation of social groups by structure. He classifi ed them into involuntary, voluntary, and delegate groups. An involuntary group is based on kinship such as the family. A man has no choice to which family he will belong. A voluntary group is one which a man joins of his own volition. He agrees to be a member of it and is free to withdraw at any time from its membership. A delegate group is one that a man joins as a representative of a number of people, either elected by them or nominated by some power. Parliament is a delegate group.

**(c)** Sumner made distinction between an in-group and an out-group. Th e groups with which the individual identifi es himself are his in-groups. Th us, his family, tribe, sex, college, occupation, religion by virtue of his awareness of likeness or consciousness of kind are his in-groups. Th ey embody the collective pronoun 'we'. Th e in-group attitudes contain some elements of sympathy and a sense of attachment to the other members of the group. An out-group is defi ned by the individual with relation to the in-group, usually expressed in the contrast between 'they' and 'we'. Every group is conscious that other groups are not with 'us'. We are democrats, they are communists; we are Hindus, they are Muslims; we are Brahmins, they are Harijans. Attitudes such as 'these are my people' and 'those others are not my people' produce a sense of attachment to the other members of the in-group, with a sense of indiff erence and even antagonism to the members of the out-group.

#### **Ethnocentrism: A Characteristic of the In-group**

Summer said that ethnocentrism is a characteristic of the in-groups. Ethnocentrism, according to him, is an assumption that the values, the ways of life and the attitudes of one's own group are superior to those of others. Th ey are the only right ones, whereas those of the others are inferior and wrong. Th e culture of the out-group is looked upon with hatred and even contempt. Summer was of the opinion that every group, past or present, small or large, is ethnocentric. Each group thinks

of itself as the best, possessing the highest values and as having accomplished the most. Th is attitude of superiority is universal, existing in all the times and in all the societies. Ethnocentrism, it may be noted, is a great barrier in the way of inter-group co-operation and mutual understanding.

## **Cooley's Classifi cation**

Cooley classifi ed groups on the basis of kind of contacts into primary and secondary groups. In a primary group, there is face-to-face and intimate relationship such as in the family. In a secondary group, such as the state or political party, the relationships are indirect, secondary, or impersonal.

## **Characteristics of a Primary Group**

Th e essential characteristics of a primary group are intimate feelings and close identifi cation. Intimacy of relationship depends upon the following factors:

- **(a)** Physical proximity
- **(b)** Small size
- **(c)** Stability
- **(d)** Similarity of background
- **(e)** Limited self-interest
- **(f)** Intensity of shared interests

## **Secondary Group**

A secondary group is one that is large in size such as a city, nation, political party, corporation, international cartel, and labour union. Here, human contacts become superfi cial and undefi ned. Th e relations of the members are limited in scope. A member exerts only indirect infl uence over the other. He knows personally only a very few of the other members and functions as one among almost countless members. His co-operation with his fellow workers is indirect and very seldom comes faceto-face with them.

## **Diff erence Between Primary Group and Secondary Group**

Th e following are the chief points of diff erence between the primary group and the secondary group:

**(a) Size:** A primary group is small in size as well as area.

**(b) Kind of co-operation:** In a secondary group, the co-operation with the fellow members is indirect. In a primary group, on the other hand, the members directly co-operate with each other.

**(c) Types of Structure:** Every secondary group is regulated by a set of formal rules.

**(d) Relationship:** Th e relationship of the members with each other in a primary group is direct, intimate and personal. Th e relations in the secondary group are of 'touch and go' type.

Th e main diff erence between the primary and secondary groups is not one of size or structure, but of relationship. If a nation is called a secondary group, it is so called because its members do not have close, personal and warm relations. It is devoid of personal interaction; its members express the body of oneness through impersonal and indirect methods.

## **Main Characteristics of Secondary Group**

Th e main characteristics of the secondary group are as follows:

- **(a)** Formal and impersonal relations
- **(b)** Large in size
- **(c)** Option of membership
- **(d)** Active and inactive members
- **(e)** Formal rules
- **(f)** Status of individual depends on his role
- **(g)** Goal oriented

#### **Spatial Groups**

Th e spatial groups are those which are constituted because of spatial continuity of their members. Such groups are the clan or sib, tribe, and band.

## **Clan or Sib**

A clan is the group of individuals who consider themselves the common descendants of a real or mythical ancestor. Mazumdar writes, 'A sib or clan is often the combination of few lineages and descent who may be ultimately traced to a mythical ancestor, who may be human, human-like, animal, plant, or even inanimate'. A clan is constituted of all the relatives of either the mother's or the father's lineage and all the off spring of one ancestor, in a lineage. Th e clan emanates from some major biblical or imagined ancestor of the family. Th e ancestor is considered to be the founder of the family. All the descendants of the family are known by his name. A clan never consists of the lineages of both the father and mother. Its descendants are either matrilineal or patrilineal. Th us, a clan is invariably unilateral. It is an exogamous combination of unilateral families. Th us, we may point out the following characteristics of a clan:

- **(a)** It is an exogamous group. Th e members of a clan do not marry any member of their clan.
- **(b)** Th e members of a clan believe in one common ancestor—real or mythical.
- **(c)** It is a unilateral group. It consists of all the families either on the mother's side or the father's side.

Clans are known by diff erent names.

- **(a)** After the names of seers; for example, Bharadwaj.
- **(b)** After the names of the totem; for example, Kunjama.
- **(c)** After substitute names; for example, Kamar.
- **(d)** After topography; for example, Jaunpuria.

## **Distinction Between Clan and Caste**

Th e clan and caste diff er in the following respects:

**(a)** Caste is a real organized group, whereas clan is based on a mythical ancestor.

**(b)** Caste is an endogamous group, whereas clan is an exogamous group. Members of a caste marry within the caste, but members of a clan do not marry among themselves.

**(c)** In the clan, the members have the same status, but in the caste, they possess higher and lower status.

#### **Functions of Clan**

Th e clan is an important group. Its members possess a 'we feeling' because they consider themselves the descendants from a common ancestor. Th ey not only help each other in times of need but are also prepared to sacrifi ce their lives for each other. Th e clan exercises great control over its members. It thereby saves its members from doing unsocial acts. It also helps in maintaining peace and order within the clan. Th e disputes among the members of a clan are settled by the head of the clan.

Likewise, in case of confl icts between diff erent clans, their heads meet together and mediate in the confl icts. Th e clan also caters to the religious needs of its members. Usually, the head of the clan is also its priest.

#### **Tribe**

According to George Peter Murdock, tribe is a social group in which there are many clans, nomadic bands, villages or other subgroups that usually have a defi nite geographical area, a separate language, a singular and distinct culture, and a common political organization or at least a feeling of common determination against the strangers. As defi ned in the *Imperial Gazette of India*, 'A tribe is a collection of families bearing a common name, speaking a common dialect, occupying or professing to occupy a common territory and is not usually endogamous, though originally it might have been so.

#### **Characteristics of Tribe**

Th e characteristics of a tribe may be summarized as follows:

- **(a) Common Territory:** Th e tribe lives on a common territory.
- **(b) Sense of Unity:** Th e members of a tribe are possessed by a sense of unity.
- **(c) Common Language:** Th e members of a tribe speak a common language.
- **(d) Endogamous:** A tribe is an endogamous group.
- **(e) Blood Relationships:** Th e members of a tribe are related by blood.

**(f) Political Organisation:** Each tribe has its own political organization. Th ere is a chief of the tribe who exercises authority over all the members of the tribe. Th e tribal chief occupies an eminent place in the tribal organization.

**(g) Importance of religion:** Religion plays an important part in a tribal organization. Th e members of a tribe worship a common ancestor.

**(h) Common name:** Th e tribe has a common name.

## **Distinction Between Tribe and Clan**

- **(a)** Tribe lives on a defi nite common territory, whereas clan has no defi nite territory.
- **(b)** Clan has no common language, whereas tribe has a common language.
- **(c)** Clan is an exogamous group, whereas tribe is an endogamous group.

## **Distinction Between Tribe and Caste**

**(a)** Tribe is a territorial group, whereas caste is a social group.

**(b)** Caste originated on the basis of division of labour, whereas tribe came about because of the evolution of community feeling in a group inhabiting a defi nite geographical area.

**(c)** Tribe has got a political organization, whereas caste is never a political association.

**(d)** Th e members of a caste follow their own defi nite occupations that are marked out for them in the society. In a tribe, the individuals can take up any profession they like.

## **Band**

Band is the original form of local the group that stands at the lowest level of social organization that of migratory hunters. It is a small group of people that possesses a strong community feeling. It is generally nomadic and does not have a defi nite place of settlement. Th e diff erence between a tribe and a band is that the latter inhabits a defi nite place and is larger in size. Although in modern society big and complex units have evolved, yet band has not entirely disappeared as an aggregation of families who live together.

## **STATUS AND ROLE**

Th e element of status is an important feature of social stratifi cation. Inequality of status is a marked feature of every society.

## **Nature of Role**

Th e social system is based on division of labour in which every person is assigned a specifi c task to perform. Th e task performed by an individual makes up the role he is expected to play in the life of his community. 'A social role', as defi ned by Lundberg, 'is a pattern of behaviour expected of an individual in a certain group or situation. It specifi es the part a person is supposed to play in the activities of his group or community'. According to Ginsberg, status is a position and a role is the manner in which that position is supposed to be fi lled. In other words, role is the functional aspect of a status. According to Davis, role is 'the manner in which a person actually carries out the requirements of his position'. Originally, the word 'role' meant the 'roll' on which an actor's part was written. Just as the successful enactment of a drama depends upon how successfully the diff erent actors play their roles, the smooth running of social life depends on how effi ciently and consistently each member of diff erent groups performs his/her role in the social system. Th us, it may be said that role consists of behaviour expected of an individual in community.

An individual has to play diff erent roles in diff erent groups. His role as the head of the family may come into confl ict with his role as a doctor. He may at times be asked to sacrifi ce his obligations towards the family in the interests of his profession. In addition, there are role confl icts involving two or more individuals who are authorized to perform the same or highly similar functions in the same situation, as when the State Government and Central Government authorities disagree on who has the jurisdiction to maintain peace in a particular case. Th e roles of two or more individuals may be in confl ict because their functions are not consistent with their status. Th e cook in a restaurant, who has a higher status, receives orders from the waiter who has a low status. Finally, people may diff er in the behaviour they expect of a person who has an assigned role. Employers and union leaders, for example, may not agree on the behaviour they expect from employees.

We may conclude that roles in the modern society are numerous, complex, highly diversifi ed, and sometimes in confl ict. In periods of rapid social change, the nervous strain of confl icting roles is greater because the requirements of each role and the expectations of the community regarding them are uncertain.

#### **Nature of Status**

Status is a term used to designate the 'comparative amounts of prestige, diff erence, or respect accorded to persons who have been assigned diff erent roles in a group or community'. Th e status of a person is high if the role, he is playing, is considered important by the group. If the role is regarded less important, its performer may be accorded lower status. Th us, the status of a person is based on social evaluations. 'Status is the worth of a person as estimated by a group or a class of persons'. Individuals in a society play diff erent roles and societies evaluate these roles diff erently. Some roles are regarded more valuable and the persons who perform these roles are given higher status. Status is thus created by the opinion of others. Th us, an individual with high status is greeted with respect and enjoys great prestige in society. An individual wins respect by virtue of his social status. An increase in the individual's social status entitles him to more respect than before.

It may also be emphasized that status and role are closely related. Each position has both a status that is socially given and a role or pattern of behaviour connected with this status that is socially expected. Status and role are two sides of a single coin, namely, a social position, a complex of rights and duties, and the actual behaviour expressing them.

#### **Determinants of Status**

Status, which a social class or an individual enjoys, depends on the social evaluations whereby the community regards certain attributes or characteristics more or less valuable than the other ones. Which attributes contribute to a higher status depends on the persons making the status evaluation. Th ese attributes may relate to values and needs shared by only a small group or by a whole society. Furthermore, the contribution of attributes to the status may diff er from 'group to group'. Th us, for example, among physicians, being a surgeon carries high status; among professors, the publication of a signifi cant research work contributes to status. Likewise, the bases of social evaluations may vary from society to society and from time to time within the same society. Today, nobility of blood, once considered esteemed in Western Europe, has little appeal, unless associated with other qualities. In feudal age, possession of land brought greater status, but it is not so now. In our society, possession of wealth or political power is considered an important attribute for a high status.

Secord and Bukman have mentioned the following three bases for status:

**(a) Reward value of high-status persons:** Persons are awarded a high status if their attributes are rewarding to each member of the group. Th e attribute, which gives the greatest reward to the greatest number, gets the maximum approval, and thus the maximum status. But these attributes should be in rare supply. Some activities may be highly important, but if all the members are engaged in these activities, then no member will be gaining an advantage in status over the others. So, only the attributes in rare supply contribute status. In a scientist group the man with deep insight and brilliance is likely to have a high status because other members of the group do not possess that insight and brilliance.

**(b) Rewards received and costs incurred:** A person is evaluated to be of high status if he/she receives rewards that others have not. A recipient of 'Vir Chakra' is likely to be accorded a high status.

 Similarly, a soldier who sacrifi ces his own life for the safety of the country is likely to get high distinction.

**(c) Investment:** Investments include features such as race, ethnic background, family, age, sex, and seniority. Th ese features confer upon a person a right to be accorded a certain status.

#### **Ascription and Achievement of Status**

Th ere are two processes by which the status of a person in society is formed. Th ese are the process of ascription and the process of achievement.

#### **Ascribed Status**

Th e status that a child receives at the time he is ushered into the process of socializations is his ascribed status, since he has not achieved it. It is determined by the following factors:

**(a) Sex:** All societies ascribe diff erent attitudes and roles to men and women.

**(b) Age:** Age is an important factor used by all the societies for role assignments.

**(c) Kinship:** Th e ascription of citizenship, religious affi liation, and community membership is in most cases a matter of identifi cation with parents.

**(d) Social factors:** Sex, age, and kinship do not exhaust all the bases for the ascription of status. Sometimes, purely social factors are used as the basis for ascription. Societies classify their members into a number of groups or categories and ascribe diff ering degrees of status to such categories.

#### **Achieved Status**

Generally, in primitive societies, greater emphasis is laid on ascribed status. In civilized societies, there is an emphasis on achieved status. Th e urban conditions of life, the extreme division of labour, and the rapid social change have made it possible for individuals to achieve status on the basis of the accomplishments.

Th e emphasis on ascription or achievement criteria depends very much on the whole package of social values. Whether a society tends to stress the concept of ascription or of achievement is fi nally

determined within a social matrix. In the modern society, the emphasis is on achievement. Th e shift to achievement criteria followed the complex changes associated with the rise of industrialism and all that went with it. In the developing nations of Asia and Africa, this shift is taking place. Th ey are moving away from the traditional descriptive forms of stratifi cation towards achievement. It may be said that the shift to achievement is an unavoidable prerequisite for the transition to modernity.

Th e factors such as sex, age, and social affi liations limit the achievement of some statuses. But society also places some limitations. A naturalized citizen cannot become the President of the United States. In India, on account of rigid caste structure, social status is fi xed.
