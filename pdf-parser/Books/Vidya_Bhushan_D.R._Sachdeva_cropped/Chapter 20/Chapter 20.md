**20 Joint Family System**

For the Indian students of sociology, the study of the Indian family system deserves special attention, not only because they are born in Indian families but also because here the family system diff ers in material respects from the western family system. Th e family in India does not consist only of husband, wife, and their children but also of uncles, aunts, cousins, and grandsons. Th is system, called a joint family or extended family system, is a peculiar characteristics of the Indian social life. A son after marriage does not usually separate himself from the parents but continues to stay with them under the same roof, messing together and holding property in common. Th e family has joint property and every person has his share in it since the time he is born. Th e earnings of all the members are put in a common fund out of which the family expenses are met. Th e non-earning members have as much share as the earning members. Th e Indian family system is thus like a socialistic community in which everyone earns according to his capacity and receives according to his needs.

Th e family in India is based on patrilineal descent. Children are identifi ed by name and allegiance with the father's family. Property is passed from generation to generation within the father's family.

## **MEANING OF JOINT FAMILY**

Some defi nitions of the joint family are as follows:

**(i)** 'A joint family is a group of people who generally live under one roof, who eat food cooked at one hearth, who hold properly in common and who participate in common worship and are related to each other as some particular type of kindred'. *—Karve* 

**(ii)** 'We call that household a joint family which has greater generation depth than individual family and the members of which are related to one another by property, income and mutual rights and obligations'. *—J. P. Desai* 

**(iii)** 'Th e joint family consists of persons having a common male ancestor, female off spring not yet married, and women brought into the group by marriage. All of these persons might live in a common household or in several households near to one another. In any case, so long as the joint family holds together, its members are expected to contribute to the support of the whole and to receive from it a share of the total product'. *—Davis* 

**(iv)** 'In a joint family not only parents and children, brothers and step-brothers live on the common property, but it may sometime include ascendants and collaterals up to many generations'. *—Jolly* 

**(v)** 'Th e Hindu joint family is a group constituted of known ancestors and adopted sons and relatives related to these sons through marriage'. *—Henry Maine* 

# **CHARACTERISTICS OF JOINT FAMILY**

Th e chief characteristics of the joint family are the following:

**(i) Large size**: Th e fi rst characteristic of the joint family is its large size. A single family consists of only the husband, wife, and their children, but a joint family consists of parents, children, grandchildren, and other near relatives along with their women. It is a group where several basic families live together at one and the same time.

**(ii) Joint property**: In a joint family, the ownership, production, and consumption of wealth take place on a joint basis. It is a cooperative institution similar to a joint stock company, in which there is joint property. Th e head of the family is like a trustee who manages the property of the family for the material and spiritual welfare of the family members. Th e total earnings of all the family members are pooled together.

**(iii) Common residence**: Th e members of the joint family usually live under the same roof. Th ey may also live in separate houses in close proximity to one another. Th ey eat the same food and wear the same type of clothes.

**(iv) Cooperative organization**: Th e basis of the joint family system is cooperation. A joint family consists of a large number of members, and if they do not cooperate with one another it is not possible to maintain the organization and structure of the joint family.

**(v) Common religion**: Generally, the members of a joint family believe in the same religion and worship similar deities. Th ey perform the religious rites and duties jointly. Th ey celebrate all the festivals and social functions jointly. Th ey also hold themselves jointly accountable for participating in social ceremonies such as marriage, death, and other occasions of the family sorrows and rejoicing. Th ey all share the family burden together.

**(vi) A productive unit:** Th is feature of a joint family is found among agricultural families. All the members work at one and the same fi eld. Th ey do the sowing and harvesting of the crops together. Even in the case of artisan classes, all the members of the joint family do one and the same function.

**(vii) Mutual rights and obligations**: Th e rights and obligations of the members of the joint family are the same. None except the head of the family has special privileges. Every member of the family has equal obligations. If the fi rst female member works in the kitchen, the second one does the laundry work and the third one looks after the children. Th ere is rotation of duties as well.

# **ORIGIN OF JOINT FAMILY SYSTEM**

It may not, however, be presumed that the joint family system originated in India. Th is institution is said to be the outcome of the settling down of the Aryans in diff erent parts of the world. We have similar institutions practically all over the world. In other parts of the world, while the joint family system has disappeared, in India it still continues though suff ering heavy strains brought about by industrialization and urbanization.

# **MERITS OF JOINT FAMILY SYSTEM**

Th e following are the chief merits of the joint family system:

**(i) Ensuring economic progress:** It enables economic progress of the country since every one in the family is guaranteed bare subsistence, a fi rst condition of economic progress. Unless people are assured of food and shelter, they would not devote themselves sincerely to the work of country's progress. It is an essential condition of national progress that the citizens must get at least two meals a day; the joint family provides this to its members and thus enables them to devote themselves to nation's progress.

**(ii) Division of labour**: It secures the advantages of the division of labour. Every member in the family works according to his/her abilities without being taxed unduly. Every phase of family's life is managed by all members including women and children. Th us, during the harvest season every member of the family helps in harvesting the crops.

**(iii) Economy**: It secures economy of expenditure. Since things are consumed in large quantities, they are procured at economic prices. Within small means a large family can be maintained if it lives jointly.

**(iv) Opportunity for leisure**: It provides opportunities for leisure to the members. Th e female members divide the household work and fi nish it within a little time, spending the rest of it in leisure.

**(v) Social insurance**: In the joint family, the orphans fi nd a comfortable asylum instead of being thrown out. Similarly, widows are assured of their proper living for whom remarriage in India is unthinkable. Th e joint family acts as a social insurance company for the old, sick, and incapacitated.

**(vi) Social virtues**: It fosters great virtues such as sacrifi ce, aff ection, cooperation, spirit of selflessness, and broadmindedness among its members and makes the family a cradle of social virtues. Under the care of elders, the undesirable and antisocial tendencies of the young are checked and they are prevented from going astray. Th ey learn to exercise self-control. All members learn to obey family rules and respect their elders.

**(vii) Avoidance of fragmentation of holdings**: It avoids fragmentation of holdings and the evils inherent therein. It prevents property from being divided.

**(viii) Socialism**: According to Sir Henry Maine, the joint family is like a corporation where the trustee is the father. Everyone in the joint family works according to his/her capabilities but obtains according to his/her needs. Th us, it realizes the socialistic ideal—from each according to his/her ability to each according to his/her needs.

# **DEMERITS OF JOINT FAMILY SYSTEM**

If the joint family system has received the highest praise for its many advantages, it has no less been vehemently denounced. Th e main defects of the system are said to be the following:

**(i) Home for idlers:** Th e joint family is the home for idlers and drones as the non-earning members do not want to earn their livelihood. When a person can eat comfortably without exerting himself, he is unlikely to indulge in any strenuous activity. Mostly, in the joint family it happens that some people have to exhaust themselves while the others lead a life of utter lethargy.

**(ii) Hindrance in the development of personality:** In the joint family, there is very little opportunity for the fostering of individual autonomy or self-dependence. Th e whole environment of the family is not congenial for the growth of the individual because he is bound by the minutest rules and regulations framed by the head of the family who looks upon men and women as children even when they attain adulthood.

**(iii) Litigation:** Th e joint family system encourages litigation; at the time of partition of common property, disputes generally crop up which are not settled without a recourse being taken to law. In case of agricultural families, partition leads to fragmentation of holdings which is harmful from the viewpoint of agricultural progress.

**(iv) Quarrels:** It is the hotbed of quarrels and bickerings especially among the female members. Generally, there is hatred and jealousy between the wives of brothers. Th ere is continuous strife and fi ghting over the doings of children. Th ere is also the clash of ideas and temperaments on account of which there are constant quarrels between the elder and young members of the family.

**(v) Privacy denied:** In a joint family, privacy is denied to the newly wed couple. Th e brides of the sons do not get an opportunity to develop their personality. Th ey hardly meet their husbands during the day. Th e invariable presence of other family members ashames the bride and she cannot freely talk to her husband. Any natural love between a husband and a wife is prevented from blossoming. Th ere is also no limit to the injustice done by the mother-in-law. In some cases the injustice becomes so inhumane and unbearable that women become fed up and commit suicide.

**(vi) Unfavourable to accumulation of capital:** It is not favourable to large accumulation of capital. When one has to share one's income with a large family, it is not possible to save much.

**(vii) Uncontrolled procreation**: In the joint family, the responsibility for bringing up and educating the children is shared. No individual feels responsibility to control procreation because of the limited income of the family. Th e off spring of one member will be treated in the same footing as others. No distinction is made between the status of the family members. In this way no direct benefi ts occur to an individual in the joint family by practising family planning or earning more.

Th us, the joint family system has got both its strong proponents and opponents. However, we are to remember that no institution is perfect and also that no institution full of defects can exist very long. Th e joint family system has been in existence since the society changed from the agricultural stage of economic development. While the system is breaking down in cities, it still largely prevails in the villages especially among the agricultural families. Although there may be exceptions here and there, it cannot be said that the system has been completely abolished. It is undoubtedly true that the system once considered the pillar of stability is fi nding it diffi cult to withstand the dizzying pace of social mobility and the transformation of values.

# **DISINTEGRATION OF JOINT FAMILY**

Th e following factors are responsible for the disintegration of the joint family system:

**(i) Industrialization:** Th e joint family system is most suited to agricultural families. India today is on the way to industrialization. With the establishment of new factories in urban areas, workers from the villages move to the cities, which breaks the joint family.

**(ii) Extension of communication and transport**: Diffi culties of communication and travel in ancient times compelled all the members of the family to live together and carry on the family occupation in agriculture and trade jointly. Today, when the means of communication and transport have been extended, it is no longer necessary for men to stay with the family and carry on the family occupation. Now, they go to the city and take up any other occupation or even living in their village adopt some other trade, and when they adopt a trade diff erent from the family trade, they establish a new home.

**(iii) Decline of agriculture and village trades**: Th e joint family system in India fl ourished in the days of yore when agriculture and trade in the villages were in a sound position. Today, with the establishment of factories, the commodities produced by the village craftsmen cannot compete in quality or price with those produced in factories, with the result that the village industries suff er loss and after some time close down. With the closing down of the village industry, the workers move to the city. Further, more land is being acquired by the government for setting up big public undertakings, creating new sectors for habitation, and providing public amenities. Th e population in the villages is growing at a faster rate than in the urban areas. Th us, the pressure on land is high, and not only the workers but land holders are also compelled to go to the city to fi nd a job there. Owing to the onrush of people from the villages to the cities, the Hindu joint family system breaks down. Besides the decline of agriculture and trade, there are other causes which induce people to move to the city. In the villages there are fewer facilities for entertainment and recreation, less opportunities for employment for the educated, and inadequate opportunities for the education of children.

**(iv) Impact of the west**: India today has been greatly infl uenced in its social outlook by western thought and ideology. Our modern laws relating to marriage and divorce have been enacted on western pattern. Our education is entirely foreign in outlook and approach. We have begun to look at the family as a partnership and not as a sacrament. Our views especially of the young men and women on sex and family relations have undergone a change. Th e infl uence of individualism has made deep inroads in our outlook.

**(v) New social legislation**: Th e joint family system in India has been very much infl uenced by the new social legislations consisting of the Civil Marriage Act (1872), Hindu Marriage Act

(1955), and Hindu Succession Act (1956). Th e Civil Marriage Act enabled the adult boys and girls to marry against the wishes of their parents. Th e Hindu Marriage Act enabled the women to seek divorce under certain conditions. Th e Hindu Succession Act gave the right of equal inheritance to women. All these acts have infl uenced the solidarity of the joint family and relationships between brothers and sisters, parents and children, and husbands and wives.

It is, however, to be remembered that the joint family system in India has not completely died out. Th e causes of its disintegration are mainly social. Th e Indian people still keep intact the family attachment and live their traditional morality. Hindu sentiments are even today in favour of the joint family. Even in cases where family property has got divided and income of the family members is not pooled, the constituent householders consider themselves duty bound to participate in ceremonial celebrations such as marriage, birthday, and religious functions. Such participation keeps the joint family feelings alive. Th e thinkers who criticize the system have not been able to appreciate it properly. Compromise and mutual adjustment are the keynotes of the Indian joint family system. Th e joint family is not a place where individuality is crushed, but it is a cooperative institution where every member does his/her duty under the guidance of the eldest members. In it we have a synthesis of individual and common interest; here are inculcated social virtues which make humans a good citizen and teach them to live for all. What is needed today is to fi nd out the ways by which the virtues of the joint family system can be retained.

## **RECONSTRUCTING THE FAMILY**

From the discussion so far, it is clear that the Indian family has changed a good deal from what it was in the past and has assumed a new form, presenting many social problems.

Writing about American homes Mr. Hoover wrote, 'Our homes are not the sanctuaries of family life they once were. We need homes where children learn respect for their parents, respect for law, respect for God and the religious principles which must be perpetuated if America is to survive as a great nation'. Th e same holds true about the Indian family. Th is is the opinion of many writers that the tendencies such as divorce and domestic discord arising in the modern families would bring about the downfall of civilization, if left unchecked. Th ere is no point denying that the modern family faces problems of serious nature which need urgent solution to make it 'home sweet home'. Th e following programmes are suggested:

**(i) Better marriages:** In spite of the challenge of changing concepts—growing sense of individuality and economic independence of women—marriage still remains the most essential and important familial institution. With the responsibilities and restrictions which marriage entails, people voluntarily choose to live within the framework of the institution of marriage. Th erefore, in the reconstruction of family we should fi rst arrange for better marriages. Marriage is an institution admitting men and women to family life. Poor marriages concluded hastily without careful and mature thought are one of the chief causes of family discords leading to divorce. Many young boys and girls seem to assume that marriage is not a serious aff air and that they can take decisions themselves. Th ey fall in romantic love before marriage and after a short romance get married. Th ey forget that love is blind and that the relation of lovers to one another is one thing and the relation of parents to children is the other. When the thrill of romance subsides, they begin to fi nd the family a burden and manage to get out of it. Th erefore, it is necessary that romantic love should not be considered a true bond of marriage; romantic love by itself cannot normally sustain the family through the inevitable stages of growth. While love gives the push that keeps a marriage moving, it does not give the direction which comes from understanding and cooperation. Marriage on short acquaintance too often proves a delusion. Careful thought for a period of time, consideration of temperaments, and family backgrounds are essential before making the choice of mates. Th e mates may themselves take the decision, but the advice of sympathetic and experienced elders will prove them helpful.

 It is also desirable that the marriage of persons of widely diff erent ages, of persons with mental defectiveness or venereal diseases, or of persons with widely diff erent cultural and racial backgrounds should be legally prohibited. But a legal prohibition is not enough. Legislation must be supported by public opinion. Unless it is so supported, it cannot improve the matter. Th e reconstruction of the family lies within the realm of human attitudes. Marriage is to be considered not as an expression of purely sexual urge but as a social safeguard. It is both a social institution and a bilateral man–woman relationship. Th e family is to be considered not merely a partnership but an institution socially necessary and sacred. Educating the young men and women for marriage will remove family instability to a great extent. Th is education should include not only adequate information concerning the facts of sex but also an understanding about the means of securing successful marriages and stable family groups.

Here, are the nine guideposts for a successful marriage:

- (i) Building of a union that is just to both.
- (ii) Decisions must be made on the basis of what is good for both, not the selfi sh or narrow wish of either.
- (iii) No demand should be made upon the mate that requires a drastic change of personality.
- (iv) Too great concentration should be avoided.
- (v) Th ere should be neither holding on to the present nor seeking to bring back the past. Each moment is good and new in itself.
- (vi) Th ere must be no cultivation of sensitiveness, no looking for hurt, but instead a complete trust in each other.
- (vii) Th ere should be willingness to grow. Marriage is a life programme of going on together that requires maturity.
- (viii) Instead of an adolescent type of blind love, there should be mature aff ection.
- (ix) Marriage is not merely sex adjustment. What is essential is life adjustment of which sex is but a part. We consider this point below.

**(ii) Mental adjustment:** Marital happiness is largely the result of mental adjustment between partners. Personality is the most crucial single factor in marital adjustment. Terman has tried to describe how the many diff erent personality traits aff ect happiness in marriage. He writes, 'Our theory is that what comes out of marriage depends upon what goes into it and that among the most important things going into it are the attitudes, preferences, aversions, habit patterns, and emotional response patterns which give or deny to one, the aptitude for compatibility'. It must be frankly recognized that every disturbance of the mental relation, especially of its sexual aspect, is not a reasonable ground for the dissolution of the family. If the family is not to suff er disorganization, every attempt must be made to bring about an adjustment of attitude between the couples. How the adjustments can be brought about, no hard and fast rule can be laid down. Th e problem admits of endless variations on individual cases. Th e point stressed is simply that if mental discord and frustration are to be avoided, there must be greater general understanding of the realities of sex life and divorce would not be viewed as an automatic solution for every disharmony in the family.

Harts have brought together a number of important suggestions to reduce marital confl icts. Th ese are (i) eliminating needless annoyances, (ii) holding in frank discussions but avoiding arguments over problems, (iii) being just, not always expecting justice, (iv) working out plans together, (v) giving special attention to enlarging areas of agreement, (vi) avoiding quarrels over non -essentials and overlooking petty diff erences; and (vii) playing the role of a good sportsperson. In other words, it may be said that the family must be organized on a democratic basis. A democratic family is one in which the husband and the wife share the authority more or less equally and according to a prearranged division of labour. It is a group whose life is primarily based not on the fear and force of authority but on the drawing power of mutual respect and aff ection. Rational love rules. Mutual self-sacrifi ce is the principle of a democratic family. In it the members adjust naturally to each other's need and to the sharing of each other's problems. If parents can be trained in principles of democratic parenthood and youth in principles of rational marriages, then society will keep the family group as one of its stable institutions. Married life is serious business, but it is easier and, at the same time, more rewarding than single life. It is an inner bulwark against loneliness.

It is however to be remembered that although the modern family is faced with serious problems, it has nevertheless also gained in many directions. Th e life of a woman need no longer be exhausted in the toils of childbearing, sucking, and the inadequate care of numberless off spring with its attendant morality, with the perpetual poverty which accompanied it. Th e responsibility and devotion of the family in the upbringing of children is more fully compensated by the satisfactions which they add to the life of the parents. Th us, the demands of sex and the demands of procreation are both more fully harmonized with the whole complex of interests and needs, which make up the existence of civilized humans.

## **MARRIAGE IN INDIA**

Since marriage is the entrance gate to the family, we may also give a little thought to marriage in India.

#### **Marriage—a Sacrament**

In India, according to the traditional Hindu law, marriage is a sacrament and not a civil contract. Th e Hindu religious books have described marriage as a duty because an unmarried man cannot perform some of the most important religious rites. Th e union is sacred and indissoluble in life and continues even after the death of the husband. Th e parents are morally obliged to fi nd mates for their children, and the children are obliged to accept the parental choice. Th e marriage is considered a union between two joint families rather than between two young persons. As such in Hindu marriage there is no room for romantic love as the basis of marital selection. Th ere is no room for courtship, because young people never see each other before marriage. Romantic love could result from marriage but could not be a cause of it. Manu did not recognize selection by mutual choice as a possible form of marriage. In short, among Hindus, marriage is compulsory. It is a sacrament, an indestructible and secret union. Second marriages, especially for women, are abhorred.

#### **Forms of Marriage**

In India marriage regulations existed from the very beginning. In Vedic times marriage was left to the choice of the persons concerned. Th ere was the practice of giving dowry in marriages. In the later samhitas, there is clear evidence of giving the bride price. 'Brahma' marriage is the best form of  marriage. A marriage is a Brahma marriage if the father or the guardian of the girl does not receive any consideration from the bridegroom for giving the girl in marriage. It diff ers from the 'asura' form in as much as in the latter there is always some consideration given by the bridegroom to the kinsmen of the bride or to the bride herself. Both these forms of marriage are open to Hindus belonging to any caste.

# **Hindu Marriage Act of 1955**

Th e Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 has now regulated the marriage among Hindus. Section 5 of the Act lays down:

A marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus, if the following conditions are fulfi lled, namely,

**(i)** neither party has a spouse living at the time of marriage;

**(ii)** neither party is an idiot or a lunatic at the time of marriage;

**(iii)** the bridegroom has completed the age of eighteen years and the bride the age of fi fteen years at the time of marriage—it has now been raised to twenty-one and eighteen years, respectively;

**(iv)** the parties are not within the degrees of prohibited relationship unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two;

**(v)** the parties are not sapindas of each other unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two;

**(vi)** if the bride has not completed the age of eighteen years, the consent of her guardians in marriage, if any, has been obtained for the marriage.

# **Marriage Rites**

Before a marriage takes legal eff ect, certain ceremonies are required to be observed. Th ese ceremonies diff er from community to community and from place to place. Sometimes, some of these ceremonies may look ridiculous and playful; nevertheless, they are regarded indispensable as well as highly religious and signifi cant. Among the Hindus, the marriage rites are said to be most complicated. Here, we are not going to describe all the rites that begin to take place since marriage is contracted and continue till the bride comes to the home of the bridegroom. Everyone of you must have attended a marriage party, and there you might have had the occasion to witness some of these rites, or in your own family a marriage might have been solemnized where you might have seen these rites being performed. Here, we draw the reader's attention to 'saptapadi' which means taking seven steps by the bride and the bridegroom jointly around the consecrated fi re. When the seventh step has been taken, the marriage becomes complete and binding under law. Before the seventh step is taken, marriage is incomplete and may be revoked. Th us, the performance of 'saptapadi' is an essential condition of Hindu marriage.

# **DIVORCE IN INDIA**

Th e Hindu shastras regarded marriage a bond indissoluble in life. Th e wife was to worship her husband as a god. To Hindu law there was no such thing as divorce. Th e custom of divorce existed only among the lower castes. Th e Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 has recognized the right

of a Hindu woman to divorce her husband. Under Section 13 of the Act, any marriage solemnized, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, may, on a petition presented by either the husband or the wife, be dissolved by a decree of divorce on the ground that the other party (i) is living in adultery; or (ii) has ceased to be a Hindu by conversion to another religion; (iii) has been incurably of unsound mind for a continuous period of not less than three years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition; or (iv) been suff ering from a virulent and incurable form of leprosy; or (v) venereal disease in the communicable form; or (vi) has renounced the world by entering any religious order; or (vii) has not been heard of as being alive for a period of seven years or by those persons who would naturally have heard of it, had that party been alive or; (viii) has not resumed cohabitation for a space of two years or upwards after the passing of a decree of judicial separation against that party; or (ix) has failed to comply with a decree for restitution of conjugal rights for a period of two years or upwards after the passing of the decree.

A wife besides the above grounds may present a petition for the dissolution of her marriage on the following grounds: (i) in the case of any marriage solemnized before the commencement of this Act, that the husband had married again before such commencement or that any other wife of the husband married before such commencement was alive at the time of the solemnization of the marriage of the petitioner, provided that in either case the other wife is alive at the time of the presentation of petition; or (ii) that the husband has, since the solemnization of the marriage, been guilty of rape, sodomy, or bestiality.

A petition for divorce cannot be presented before a period of three years of marriage. The Act also provides for judicial separation on the ground that the other party (i) has deserted the petitioner for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition or; (ii) has treated the petitioner with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the petitioner that it will be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live with the other party; (iii) has, for a period of not less than one academic year immediately preceding the presentation of the petition, been suffering from a virulent form of leprosy; or (iv) has, for a period of not less than three years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition, been suffering from venereal disease in the communicable form, the disease not having been contracted from the petitioner; or (vi) has been continuously of unsound mind for a period of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition; or (vi) has after the solemnization of the marriage had sexual intercourse with any person other than his or her spouse.

Although it may be said that divorce has helped the women to develop the feeling of independence in them and make them feel equal partner, it may not be advocated that divorce should be easily granted by the courts. It cannot be denied that divorce causes instability of the family. In view of its serious repercussions on family life, divorce should not be within easy reach of the partners. Eff orts should be made to bring reunion between a husband and a wife. Divorce should be granted only when it has become unavoidable and is in the interests of both the husband and wife and the society at large.

## **MARRIAGE AND FAMILY PROBLEMS IN INDIA**

**(i) Present lower status of women**: In considering the marriage and family problems in India, we have fi rst to consider the 'status' of women in the Hindu family. Critics of the Indian family system say that Indian women do not enjoy equal rights with men in the social, political,

# **225**

 religious, and economic fi elds, they are ill treated, and they cannot claim any share in the family property. Before marriage a woman depends on her father, after marriage on her husband and in old age on her sons. She never has an independent living according to her own likes and dislikes but is made to live as her patrons direct her to live. She from the cradle to the grave has to bear degradation and insult silently, and if the husband dies leaving her still young, she is forced to live a widowed life and is not allowed to remarry.

 In ancient India, women enjoyed a high place in society. No religious ceremony in the family was considered to be complete without her participation. 'Where women are honoured,' says Manu, 'the gods are pleased, but where they are not honoured, no sacred rite yields any reward'. She was called the goddess of the family, 'Grih Laxmi'. It is due to certain historical factors that she has now come to occupy a lower position. In order to maintain the purity of the Aryan race from the Dravidians, a number of restrictions began to be imposed on her. Th e social drive towards the restrictions of her freedom resulted in her fall in the long run. Th e woman was no more an emancipated personality, but became a slave of the man. Th e socializing force of a woman to the Indo-Aryan society disappeared. Man-made laws and Manu's viewpoints decided her fate.

 In the Gupta period, with the revival of Brahminism, greater restrictions were put upon women. Marriage became an obligation to women. Th e custom of *sati* was established. During the Rajput period, this custom was practised with severity. Th e widow had to throw her l iving body on toe funeral pyre of her husband. Widows were prohibited from remarrying. With the advent of Islam, child marriage came to be established and purdah system became widely practised. In short, the position of the woman deteriorated to such an extent that she had hardly any rights worth the name; her keen senses were dulled and without any right of knowledge she was steeped in ignorance and prejudice. Social prejudices against her were so fi rmly established that she had hardly any opportunity, freedom, or chances of development and self-expression.

**(ii) Reform movements:** Social reformers such as Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chander Vidyasagar, Justice Ranade, and Nataranjan started movements to put an end to some of the inhumane practices. Th ese reformers succeed to some extent and were able to get certain Acts passed, putting an end to some evil practices. Th e All India Women Conference also made its bid to improve the conditions of women. Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation, gave a call to the women of this country to join him in freedom struggle. Th e call did not go in vain. Women in large numbers began to take part in the freedom movement. Th e part that they played amazed the world. Th eir picketing of liquor and foreign goods shops, marching in demonstrations, courting prisons, facing lathi charges and bullets—all these things were unique in the history of a country where women were suppressed, degraded, and insulted through the centuries. Th e age-old restrictions were broken within no space of time; slowly and gradually women acquired more and more rights without even begging for them. Th e Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, the Hindu Succession Act of 1956, the Dowry prohibition Act of 1985, and the Commission of Sati Act of 1987 are fresh eff orts to remove most of the disabilities from which Indian women are suff ering. Th e Department of Women and Child Development in the Government of India has been given the main responsibility of coordinating and executing the welfare programmes for women. A number of voluntary agencies are working in the fi eld of women development. Women Development Corporations have been set up to assist women in better employment opportunities. Th e year 1987 was declared International Women Year. A National Commission of self-employed women has also been appointed. Th e 73rd Amendment Act has reserved one-third seats for women in the

local bodies and now there is a move for similar reservation in the elections to the parliament and state legislations. However, there is much to be done especially for the womenfolk of the villages where old prejudices and customs still hold deep roots in the family life.

**(iii) Dowry system:** Another problem that is to be considered regarding marriage problems in India is the commercial aspect of the marriage. By it we mean the dowry system. It needs no mention with what evils the system is fraught; the father of the girl commits suicide because he has not been able to manage for the dowry demanded by the parents of the boy. Sometimes, the girl herself commits suicide on that account. Due to dowry system, the parents are sometimes compelled to marry the girl to a man who is almost fi t to be her father. Th e parents often commit theft, forgery, or misappropriation to arrange the dowry. Th e Government of India having realized the evils of the system has brought a Dowry Prohibition Act on the statute book. With the passage of the Act, it is hoped the evils of the system will be removed. But the Act by itself would not be able to achieve its purpose unless public opinion is aroused against the system.
