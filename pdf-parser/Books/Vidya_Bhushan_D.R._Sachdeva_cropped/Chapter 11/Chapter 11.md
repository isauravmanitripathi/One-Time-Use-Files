#### **MEANING OF RELIGION**

It is not an easy task to give a defi nition of religion that will satisfy everyone. Writers have defi ned religion in various ways. According to Ogburn, 'Religion is attitude towards superhuman powers'. James G. Frazer· considered religion as a belief in 'powers superior to man which are believed to direct and control the course of nature of human life'. Arnold W. Green defi nes religion as 'a system of beliefs and symbolic practices and objects governed by faith rather than by knowledge, which relates man to an unseen supernatural realm beyond the known and beyond the controllable. According to Malinowski, 'Religion is a mode of action as well as system of belief and a sociological phenomenon as well as a personal experience'.

Th us, there are numerous defi nitions of religion given by thinkers according to their own conceptions. As a matter of fact the forms in which religion expresses itself vary so much that it is diffi cult to agree upon a defi nition. Some maintain that religion includes a belief in the supernatural or mysterious powers and that it expresses itself in overt activities designed to deal with those powers. Some regard religion as belief in the immortality of the soul. While it is possible to defi ne religion as belief in God or some supernatural powers, it is well to remember that there can also be a godless religion as Buddhism. Th e Buddhists reject belief in the immortality of the soul and the life in the hereafter. Summer and Keller asserted that, 'Religion in history from the earliest to very recent days has not been a matter of morality at all but of rites, ritual observance and ceremony'.

In sociology, the word religion is used in a wider sense than that used in religious books. A recent sociological work defi nes religion as 'those institutionalized systems of beliefs, symbols, values, and practices that provides groups of men with solutions to their questions of ultimate being'. A common characteristic found among all religions is that they represent a complex of emotional feelings and

attitudes towards mysteries and perplexities of life. As such religion comprises (i) system of attitudes, beliefs, and symbols that are based on the assumption that certain kinds of social relations are sacred or morally imperative and (ii) a structure of activities governed or infl uenced by these systems.

According to Anderson and Parker, each religion consists of four components.

**(i) Belief in supernatural forces:** Each religion believes in some supernatural forces—powers outside of man and his observable world. Th ese powers are believed to infl uence human conditions and events. Some call them forces of God, some call them gods, yet others leave them nameless.

**(ii) Man's adjustment to supernatural powers:** Since man is dependent on these powers, he must adjust himself to them. Consequently, each religion provides for some outward acts like prayers, hymns, kirtans, yagyas, and other forms of reverence. Failure to perform these acts is regarded as sinful.

**(iii) Acts defi ned as sinful:** Each religion defi nes certain acts as sinful. Such acts destroy man's harmonious relationship with god or the gods and he suff ers the wrath of God.

**(iv) Method of salvation:** Man needs some method by which he can regain harmony with the gods through removal of guilt. Th us, Buddhism provides for Nirvana, and Hinduism provides salvation in the release from the bondage of Karma.

### **FORMS OF RELIGION**

Religion seeks to interpret and control man's relations to the forces of his physical and social environment. Th ese forces are thought to be under the control of some supernatural power. Th e attempt to interpret man's relations to these forces led to several forms of religion like superstition, animism, magic, ceremonialism. A brief explanation of these forms is necessary in order to clarify the concept of religion.

**Superstition:** Superstition is the conviction that something shall happen owing to the causes utterly disproportionate to the event; for example, the belief that there would be some trouble in the journey or pain at its end because a cat has crossed the path, or that there will come some calamity because a star has fallen from the sky, or that Saturday is not a good day for sending a woman to her husband's house, or number 13 is inauspicious. Th e Hindu religion is full of such superstitions.

**Animism:** Animism is a belief in the spirits of the dead. It is a name given to the theory of spirits that are supposed to be dwelling in certain places or things so that they can communicate with men. Very commonly the view is held that spirits visit a man in sleep. Sometimes a man is said to have heard the spirit speak from a corner of the house. If Hindus do not feed their ancestors, their spirits will not feel happy in the other world. To feed the ancestors a fi fteen-day festival called 'shradh' is celebrated among Hindus.

**Magic:** Magic is a system of manipulation by which an eff ect is sought through the action of unseen powers. Th e magician attempts to control the powers by magical practices not validated by scientifi c knowledge, such as rubbing a stone on the diseased part of the body to cure it, walking on fi re without being burnt, eating glass pieces without shedding any blood, turning a piece of charcoal into a rupee, making a body disappear, getting a purse out of the pocket of a man without going near or about him.

**Ceremonialism:** Ceremonialism is a collective practice usually associated with religion. Th us, praying, feasting, dancing, singing, kneeling are examples of ceremonialism or ritualism. Like the belief itself it comes to have a quality of sacredness attached to it. Hinduism lays great stress on rituals. At the time of birth, marriage, and death in a Hindu family many ritual ceremonies are observed.

Religion pervades practically in all the societies, but there is an endless diversity of the forms of religious belief and practice. Th e form that it assumes in a society is determined by a host of complex factors. Diff erent societies emphasize diff erent elements of religion. Some assign greater importance to ceremonialism. Th us, Hindu society attaches great importance to ceremonies. Th e Mantras must be recited at the time of birth, marriage, and death whether or not one understands their meaning.

# **SOCIAL ROLE OF RELIGION**

Although religion is a highly personal thing, yet it has a social aspect and social role to play. It has been a powerful agency in the society and performed many important social functions.

**(i) Explains individual suff ering:** Man does not live by knowledge alone. He is an emotional creature as well. Religion serves to soothe the emotions of man in times of his suff ering and disappointments and contributes to the integration of his personality. In this world, man often suff ers disappointment and frustration even in the midst of all hopes and achievements. Th e things for which he strives are in some measure always denied to him. When human hopes are blighted, when all that was planned and striven for has been swept away, man naturally wants something to console and compensate him.

**(ii) A source of social cohesion:** Religion is the ultimate source of social cohesion. Th e primary requirement of society is the common possession of social values by which individuals control the actions of self and others and through which society is perpetuated. Th ese social values are never scientifi cally demonstrated, but emanate from religious faith. Religion is the foundation on which these values rest. Science and technology cannot create these values. Children should obey their parents, should not tell a lie or cheat, women should be faithful to men, people should be honest and virtuous are some of the social values which maintain social cohesion. It is religion that asks man to renounce unsocial activities and requires him to accept limitations upon his wants and desires. Love and service are two great teachings of religion. All religions preach love and honesty to the followers.

**(iii) Social welfare:** Religion has served humanity through the spreading of education. Th e scriptures Ramayan, Bhagvad Gita, Quran, and Bible are great literary works and storehouse of knowledge. It has also emphasized benevolence and forbearance. It also created the habit of charity among the people who opened 'many charitable institutions like hospitals, rest-houses, and temples to help the needy and the poor.

**(iv) Agency of social control:** Religions emphasize, in one form or another, the consequences resulting from behaviour. Rewards or punishments follow approved or disapproved actions. Religions support the folkways and customs by placing the power sanctions of the supernatural behind them. Th ey make certain acts not only off ences against society but against God as well. Disobedience brings condemnation from the spiritual forces. In its positive form, religion provides a model for living. It upholds certain ideals and values. Th e believer imbibes these ideals and values in his life. Religion can help our youth become moral, disciplined, and socialized citizens of the society.

**(v) Religion controls and aff ects economic life also:** Max Weber was of the view that religion also infl uences the economic system of the believers. Th us, according to him, capitalism grew in the protestant nations like England, USA, and Holland. It did not grow in Italy and Spain where the people are Catholics. Th e Hindus lay great stress on spiritual progress than on material progress. Hence, materialism could not grow in India.

**(vi) Promotion of literature:** Besides, religion has also contributed to the growth of literature, art, and music. Th e desire to laud and please gods had led people to extol them in song, sculpture, painting, and architecture. Some of the world's most beautiful monuments are buildings erected to the glory of the gods. Vast temples like Tirupati and Mahabaleshwar, mosques like Jama Masjid, cathedrals like Roman Church, and artistic images of gods and goddesses like Vishnu and Durga express man's desire to portray his conceptions of the supernatural in aesthetic and inspiring ways. Th e sacred writings stimulate appreciation of beautiful prose and poetry. Religious themes are the inspiration for some of man's fi nest paintings, and the desire to sing praises has led to the creation of some of the world's fi nest music.

**Dysfunctions of religion:** Religion is the supremely integrating and unifying force in human society. But at the same time it has also proved to be a catastrophic force. Marx called religion 'the opiate of the masses', which has kept them in degrading subjection. Th e masses are taught to submit to their poor lot in life and remain in that station of life in which God wanted them to be. Th e history of religion is mostly the history of persecution. Wars have been fought in its name. It has degenerated in dogmatism and bigotism, denying freedom of thought. It has favoured war and poverty, exploitation and fatalism, prostitution and idleness and advocated such practices as cannibalism, suicide, slavery, untouchability, and incest. Th ere is hardly a vice that religion has not at one time or another actively supported. It suppressed the democratic aspirations of the common people. In India, the country was partitioned in the name of religion, and even today religion in the garb of communalism stands to threaten the national solidarity. Th e Ayodhya issue has revived the memories of 1947. Th e Mandir–Masjid dispute has engulfed the nation into communal riots. Th e political parties exploit the religious card to create vote-banks. Th e sane leaders have surrendered to religious militancy. Genuine religion has disappeared. It has been commercialized and politicized. Sectarian organizations have come up which fl ourish by preaching hatred for 'others'. Religious leaders also have entered the play-fi eld of politics and the places of religion—temples and mosques, have become the arena of political manipulations.
