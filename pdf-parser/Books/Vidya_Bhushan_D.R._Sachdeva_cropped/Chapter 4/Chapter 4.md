# **4 Social Processes**

# **THE MEANING OF SOCIAL INTERACTION**

Man is a social and cultural being, and society is both natural and necessary for man. It is diffi cult for man to live in isolation. Man has always lived in various groups and associations. All the members of these groups act and behave in a certain manner. Th e behaviour of each individual is aff ected by the behaviour of others. Th is interaction is the essence of social life. Behaviour systems grow out of interaction. Without interaction there would be no social or group life. Mere physical proximity of individuals does not unite them into a group or social unit. An associative life exists only when they mix with one another—play or talk together to realize a common end, or even compete or confl ict with one another. Th us, interaction is the basic ingredient of social relationships. Society is rooted in interaction. Green defi nes social interaction as 'the mutual infl uences that individuals and groups have on one another in their attempts to solve problems and in their striving towards goals'. According to Dawson and Gettys, 'Social interaction is the process whereby men interpenetrate the minds of each other'. In the words of Gist, 'Social interaction is the reciprocal infl uence human beings exert on each other through interstimulation and response'. According to Eldredge and Merril, 'Social interaction is the general process whereby two or more persons are in meaningful contact as a result of which their behaviour is modifi ed, however slightly'.

Th us, social interaction refers to the entire range of social relationships, wherein there is reciprocal stimulation and response between individuals. An aggregate of individuals becomes a society not because each individual possesses 'its content' which actuates him, but because there is a reciprocal infl uence—direct or indirect. Social interaction produces some defi nite infl uence upon social relations that exist among human beings. It establishes mental relations among persons. It is the reciprocal infl uence mutually exerted by human beings through their stimulation and mutual response. According to Park and Burgess, social interaction is of a dual nature, of persons with persons and of groups with groups. Th e two essential conditions of social interaction are (1) social contact and (2) communication. Social contact diff ers from physical or bodily contact. Social contact can be established through the medium of radio, letters, telephones, and other media of communication even between people thousands of miles apart. Of course, social contact is strengthened by physical contact. According to Gillin and Gillin, 'Social contact is the fi rst phase of interaction'.

Social contacts can be positive as well as negative. Th ey are positive when they lead to benevolence, co-operation, mutual understanding, and assimilation. Th ey are negative if they create hatred, jealousy, and confl ict.

Social contacts are established through various mediums of communications. Hence, the means of communication are essential adjuncts of social contact. Such means are language, script, gestures, symbols, radio, telephone, post and telegraph services, newspapers, etc. Human interaction is essentially communicative interaction.

# **SOCIO-CULTURAL PROCESSES**

Social interaction usually takes place in the form of co-operation, competition, confl ict, accommodation, and assimilation. Th ese forms of social interactions are also designated as social processes. Th ese social processes may, therefore, be described as the fundamental ways in which men interact and establish relationships. MacIver observes, 'Social process is the manner in which the relations of the members of a group, once brought together, acquire a certain distinctive character'. He further explains that it also implies changes from one state of relationship to another, directed up and down, forward and backward, and hence leading towards integration or disintegration. According to Ginsberg, 'Social processes mean the various modes of interaction between individuals or groups including cooperation and confl ict, social diff erentiation and integration, development, arrest and decay'. Social interaction and social process are interrelated. Th e one cannot be understood without the other. Interaction refers to an action done in response to another action, but when this interaction through repetition leads to a result, it is called a social process. Th us, when husband and wife help each other out of sympathy or love and this mutual help assumes the form of co-operation, it becomes a social process.

Social processes are so fundamental to the life of a community that understanding of human society is not possible without their study. Indeed, some sociologists conceive of society as the expression of diff erent social processes or forms of interactions and hold that sociology should concern itself almost exclusively with study of these forms. Simmel, for instance, remarks that society exists wherever several individuals are in reciprocal relationships and that which constitutes an aggregation of individuals into a society is not their life-content, but their reciprocal infl uence. Simmel consequently devoted most of his researches to the analysis of those relationships. Other sociologists who analysed society mainly in terms of social processes were Ratzenhofer, Tonnies, Vikrant, and Von Wiese in Germany and Park, Burgess, and Ross in America. Ratzenhofer had maintained that society should be viewed as a social process, that is, in terms of totality of social relationships. Society, in his view, exists in the form of reciprocal human relationships within a group. Similarly, Simmel viewed society as essentially a social process and sociology as the discipline concerned with the study of that process. It is thus obvious that it is essential for a student of sociology that he should study the various forms of social processes and their nature in order to understand social phenomena.

#### **Co-operation**

#### *Defi nition of Co-operation*

Co-operation is the most pervasive and continuous of the social processes. It is an integrating activity and is believed to be the opposite of competition. In reality, however, it is conflict rather than competition which is the opposite of co-operation. Co-operation generally means working together in the pursuit of like or common interest. Green defines co-operation as 'the continuous and common endeavour of two or more persons to perform a task or to reach a goal that is commonly cherished'. In the words of Merril and Eldredge, 'Cooperation is a form of social interaction wherein two or more persons work together to gain a common end'. Fairchild writes, 'Cooperation is the process by which individuals or groups combine their effort, in a more or less organised way for the attainment of common objective'. The word ' co-operation' is derived from two Latin words, 'co' meaning together and 'operating' meaning to work. It is thus joint activity in pursuit of common goals or shared rewards. It is goal oriented and a conscious form of social interaction. It involves two elements (i) common end and (ii) organized effort:

Cooley says, 'Co-operation arises when men see that they have a common interest and have, at the same time, suffi cient intelligence and self-control to seek this interest through united action: perceived unity of interest and faculty of organisation are the essential facts in intelligent combination'.

Co-operation, it may be noted, imposes restraints on the participant. A person cannot have his/her way entirely if working co-operatively with another person. Co-operation always implies inhibition of certain ego-centred drives. From the restraint so imposed, there arises a moral control that is lacking in uninhibited confl ict.

Co-operation is brought about by several circumstances such as (i) desire for individual benefi ts, (ii) desire to give, (iii) devotion to common purposes, (iv) situational necessity, and (v) desire to achieve larger goals.

#### *Types of Co-operation*

Th ere are many modes of co-operation in social life, but its principal types are the following:

**(i) Direct co-operation:** In this type of co-operation, individuals do like things together, that is, perform identical functions; for example moving a pile of stones or pushing a motor car out of the mud. Playing together, worshipping together, tilling the fi elds together are other instances of direct co-operation.

**(ii) Indirect co-operation:** It is the co-operation in which people do unlike tasks towards a similar end. In other words, in this type of co-operation, individuals work towards a common end, but each has his own specialized function; for example, when carpenters, plumbers, and masons co-operate to build a house. Th is co-operation is based on the famous principle of the division of labour.

**(iii) Primary co-operation:** It is the co-operation which is found in primary groups such as the family. In this form of co-operation, there is an identity of interests between the individual and the group. Th e achievement of the interest of the group includes the realization of the individual's interests.

**(iv) Secondary co-operation:** Th is type of co-operation is found in the secondary groups such as government, industry, church, and trade union.

**(v) Tertiary co-operation:** Th is co-operation is found in the interaction between the various big and small groups to meet a particular situation. Th us, when a National Front is formed by diff erent political parties to win the poll against the Congress party it is tertiary co-operation. In such a type of co-operation, the attitudes of the co-operating parties are purely opportunistic; the organization of their co-operation is both loose and fragile.

#### *Role of Co-operation*

Co-operation is a universal phenomenon. It is so important in the life of an individual that according to Kropotkin, it is diffi cult to survive without it. People learn their fi rst lessons in co-operation as members of their families. Most of the individual and collective goals cannot be achieved without co-operation. It is needed at every step in our lives. Th e physical, mental, and even the spiritual needs of the individual remain unsatisfi ed if he does not agree to co-operate with his fellow members.

All the progress that mankind has made in the various fi elds is attributed to the co-operating spirit of the people. Th e astounding achievements of science and technology, the initial success of man in his fl ight to the moon, the attempt to bridge the gulf between the standards of living of the highly developed and the most undeveloped countries, all are the results of human co-operation. So great is the realization of the necessity of co-operation on the part of every nation, for the solution of international problems, that they are sparing no pains to secure it even at the risk of sacrifi cing some of their cherished convictions.

# **Competition**

#### *Defi nition of Competition*

According to Bogardus, 'Competition is a contest to obtain something that does not exist in a quantity suffi cient to meet the demand'. According to Anderson and Parker, 'Competition is that form of social action in which we strive against each other for the possession of or use of limited material or non-material good'. Th ere is no competition for sunshine and air which are unlimited. Th ere is competition not only for bread but also for luxuries, power, social position, mates, fame, and all other things not available for one's asking. Competition often leads to new achievements in diff erent fi elds. It is an eff ort to outdo the competitor in achieving some mutually desired goal. Since scarcity of resources is, in a sense, an inevitable condition of social life, consequently, competition of some sort or the other is found in all societies.

#### *Characteristics of Competition*

Th e following characteristics determine the nature of competition:

**(i) Competition is impersonal struggle:** Park and Burgess have defi ned competition as 'interaction without social contact'. It is usually not directed against any individual or group in particular; the competitors are not in contact and do not know one another. Competition is, generally, not personalized. When the individuals compete with one another, not on personal level, but as members of groups, such as business, social or cultural organizations, tribes, nations, and political parties, the competition is called impersonal.

**(ii) Competition is an unconscious activity:** Competition takes place on the unconscious level. Students, for example, do not conceive of their classmates as competitors, even though there are only a limited honours available, and if certain members of the class get them, the honours

are automatically denied to the others. Students may be conscious of the competition and much concerned about marks. It remains a competition just so long as their attention is focused on the reward or desired goal for which they are striving rather than on the competitors. When there is a shift in interest from the objects of competition to the competitors themselves, it becomes rivalry or *personal competition.*

**(iii) Competition is universal:** Competition is found in every society and in every age. As the things people wish to secure are limited in supply, there is competition all round to secure them.

#### *Value of Competition*

Competition, like co-operation, is indispensable in social life. It arises from the fact that individuals are capable of independent locomotion and have the capacity for gaining experience as a result of independent action. Some sociologists are of the view that it is even a more basic process than co-operation. Hobbes had remarked that the struggle is the basic law of life and that earliest man lived in a continual state of warfare. Hume, Hegel, Rousseau, and Bagehot also corroborated the views of Hobbes. Later on, the theory of the survival of the fi ttest which developed as a result of Darwin's theory of evolution also stressed the importance of competition in society.

Competition performs many useful functions in society. According to H. T. Mazumdar, it performs fi ve positive functions. First, it helps determine the status and location of individual members in a system of hierarchy; second, it tends to stimulate economy, effi ciency, and investiveness; third, it tends to enhance one's ego; fourth, it prevents undue concentration of power in an individual or group of individuals; and fi fth, it creates respect for the rules of the game.

Th e functions of competition are briefl y summarized as follows:

**(i) Assignment of individuals to proper places:** It assigns individuals a place in the social system. Competition determines who is to perform what function. Th e division of labour and the entire complex economic organization in modern life are, thus, the products of competition. In the words of E. A. Ross, 'Competition is a progressive force which fulfi ls and does not necessarily destroy'. Th e stimulus of competition has played a considerable role in the technological and organizational innovation.

**(ii) Source of motivation:** Competition furnishes motivation in the desire to excel or to obtain recognition or to win an award. It stimulates achievement by lifting the levels of aspiration; the individuals work harder if competing than if working on their own with no thought of rivalry.

**(iii) Conducive to progress:** Fair competition is conducive to economic as well as social progress and even to general welfare because it spurs individuals and groups to exert their best eff orts. Its obvious connection with what is called progress has led some thinkers to regard it as the essential feature of modern civilization.

It may not, however, be presumed that competition is a prerequisite to social progress. Mazumdar has mentioned its three negative functions. First, it may lead to neurosis through frustration; second, it may lead to monopoly; and third, it may lead to confl icts. Competition can be vicious both for individuals and groups. It may create emotional disturbances. It may develop unfriendly and unfavourable attitudes among the persons or groups towards one another. Unfair competition has the most disintegrating eff ects. If uncontrolled, it becomes a confl ict involving unethical and, sometimes, violent practices. In the economic sphere, competition results in waste and lack of consideration for the real needs of the people. It can lead to starvation in the midst of plenty, to fear and insecurity, to instability and panic. Unlimited competition leads to monopoly. In the economic fi eld, businessmen seek to protect themselves against competition; for example, by erecting tariff barriers against foreign competition, by agreeing upon prices. Labour unites for protecting its wages, excluding foreign labour, and for a number of other purposes. Bureaucrats protect themselves through their association. Races protect their interests by excluding others from entering within their fold.

However, no society is exclusively competitive or exclusively co-operative. Th e social system is a balance between competitive and co-operative forces. But competition should always be healthy and fair. Only then can it be advantageous both for the individual progress and welfare of the group.

# **Confl ict**

#### *Defi nition of Confl ict*

Confl ict is an ever present process in human relations. It has been defi ned by A. W. Green as 'the deliberate attempt to oppose, resist or coerce the will of another or others'. According to Gillin and Gillin, 'Confl ict is the social process in which individuals or groups seek their ends by directly challenging the antagonist by violence or threat of violence'. As a process, it is the antithesis of co-operation. Almost any human action is likely to thwart the hopes or interfere with the plans of someone else. Such action becomes confl ict, however, only if the deliberate attempt is to oppose. When a candidate secures a job, it implies that the job is denied to others. But the successful candidate has no deliberate intent to oppose, resist, or coerce and it cannot, therefore, be called a confl ict situation. Confl ict is, in other words, a competition in its more occasional, personal, and hostile forms. It is a process of seeking rewards by eliminating or weakening the competitors. In a confl ict, one party attempts to destroy or annihilate the other party or at least tries to reduce it to a subordinate position. Although, normally, violence is associated with confl ict, it can occur without it. Gandhiji's policy of civil disobedience and non-violence as practised under satyagraha to fi ght against the British imperialism is the best example of confl ict without violence.

#### *Causes of Confl ict*

Confl ict is universal. It occurs in all times and places. Th ere has never been a time or a society in which some individuals or groups did not come into confl ict. According to Malthus, reduced supply of the means of subsistence is the cause of confl ict. According to Darwin, the principles of struggle for existence and survival of the fi ttest are the main causes of confl ict. According to Freud and some other psychologists the innate instinct for aggression in man is the main cause of confl icts. Confl icts also ensue as a result of the diff erence between the rate of change in the moral norms of a society and men's desire, hopes, dissatisfactions, and demands. Th e moral norm that children should obey their parents has persisted in our country since times immemorial, but now the younger generation wants to go its own way. In consequence, there is more parent–youth confl ict than ever before. Briefl y stated, the causes of confl icts are as follows:

**(i) Individual diff erences:** No two men are alike in their nature, attitudes, ideals, and interest. On account of these diff erences, they fail to accommodate themselves, which may lead to confl icts among them.

**(ii) Cultural diff erences:** Culture is the way of life of a group. Th e culture of one group diff ers from the culture of the other group. Th e cultural diff erences among the groups sometimes cause tension and lead to confl ict. Th e religious diff erences have occasionally *led* to wars and persecution in history. India was partitioned in the name of religious diff erences.

**(iii) Clash of interest:** Sometimes, there is a clash of interests among diff erent people or groups. For example, the interests of the workers clash with those of the employers, which leads to confl ict between them.

**(iv) Social change:** Social change becomes a cause of confl ict when a part of society does not change along with the changes in the other parts. Social change causes cultural lag, which leads to confl ict. Th e parent–youth confl ict is the result of social change. In short, confl ict is an expression of social disequilibrium.

#### *Types of Confl ict*

Simmel distinguished four types of confl icts: (i) war, (ii) feud or factional strife, (ii) litigation, and (iv) confl ict of impersonal ideals. War is the kind of group confl ict we are most familiar with. Prior to the development of interterritorial trade, war provided the only means of contact between alien groups. In this case, war, although dissociative in character, had a defi nitely associative eff ect. Simmel attributed war to a deep-seated antagonistic impulse in man. But to bring this antagonistic impulse to action, some defi nite objective is needed which may be the desire to gain material interest. It may be said that antagonistic impulse provides a foundation for confl ict.

Feud is an intra-group form of war that may arise because of injustice alleged to have been done by one group to the other.

Litigation is a judicial form of confl ict when an individual or group asserts its claims to certain rights on the basis of objective factors; subjective factors being excluded.

Confl ict of impersonal ideals is a confl ict carried on by the individuals not for themselves, but for an ideal. In such a confl ict, each party attempts to justify truthfulness of its own ideals; for example, the confl ict carried on by the communists and capitalists to prove that their own system can bring in a better world order.

Gillin and Gillin have mentioned fi ve types of confl icts: (i) personal confl ict, (ii) racial confl ict, (iii) class confl ict, (iv) political confl ict, and (v) International confl ict. Personal confl ict is a confl ict between two persons within the same group; a confl ict between two students is a personal confl ict. Th e racial confl ict between the Whites and Negroes in the USA is an example of racial confl ict. Class confl ict is a confl ict between two classes. According to Karl Marx, Society has always been divided between two economic classes—the exploiters and the exploited, which have always been at confl ict with each other. Political confl ict is a confl ict between the parties for political power. Th us, the confl ict between the Congress party and opposition parties is a political confl ict. International confl ict is a confl ict between two nations. Th e confl ict between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue is an international confl ict.

Confl ict can also be of the following types:

**(i) Latent and overt confl ict:** Latent confl ict may exist as social tension and dissatisfaction for very long periods before it erupts in hostile action. . Latent confl ict becomes overt confl ict when an issue is declared and when hostile action is taken. Sometimes actual confl ict may exist in latent form for years before there is a formulation of issue or a crisis. Th e latent confl ict between China and India over the boundary issue may become overt in the form of outbreak of war.

**(ii) Corporate and personal confl ict:** Corporate confl ict occurs among the groups within a society or between two societies. Race riots, communal upheavals, religious persecution, labour–management confl ict, and war between nations are the examples of corporate confl ict. Personal confl ict, on the other hand, occurs within a group.

Personal confl icts arise on account of various motives; envy, hostility, and betrayal of trust being the most predominant.

#### *Role of Confl ict*

As discussed above, confl ict is a fundamental human and societal trait. H. T. Majumdar has mentioned the following positive functions of confl ict.

- **(i)** Confl ict tends to stiff en the morale and promote the solidarity of the in-group.
- **(ii)** Confl ict, concluded with victory, leads to the enlargement of the victorious group.
- **(iii)** Confl ict leads to redefi nition of value systems.
- **(iv)** Confl ict may leave to the working out of non-violent techniques for resolving crises.
- **(v)** Confl ict may lead to change in the relative status of the confl icting parties.
- **(vi)** Confl ict may lead to a new consensus.

Horton and Hunt have classifi ed the eff ects of confl ict, as given in the following table.

| Integrative Eff ects                    | Disintegrative Eff ects                                         |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Defi ne issues                          | Increase bitterness                                             |
| Lead to resolution of issues            | Lead to destruction and bloodshed                               |
| Increase group cohesion                 | Lead to intergroup tension                                      |
| Lead to alliances with other groups     | Disrupts normal channels of co-operation                        |
| Keep groups alert to members' interests | Diverts<br>members'<br>attention<br>from<br>group<br>objectives |

### *Diff erence Between Confl ict and Competition*

Confl ict and competition are not identical terms. Th ey should not, therefore, be confused. Confl ict diff ers from competition in many ways. For example, confl ict takes place on a conscious level, it is personal, it involves violence or at least the threat of violence. Confl ict always includes awareness of an adversary and overt confl ict always includes harming an adversary in some way. Competition may, however, occur without the actual knowledge of the other's existence; for example, in case of civil service examination the competitors are not aware of one another. Th ey are primarily concerned with the achievement of goal, but they do not strive for the purposes of denying or opposing others—else the action would become overt. Again, competition is always governed by moral norms, whereas many confl icts are not, as is proved by the maxim 'everything is fair in war'.

Lastly, whereas competition is a continuous process, confl ict is intermittent. Confl ict has the tendency to recur, as the diff erences are seldom resolved permanently. It is this start and stop character of confl ict that helps to distinguish it from competition.

To clarify the distinction between confl ict and competition the following points may be noted.

- **(i)** Confl ict involves contact, competition does not.
- **(ii)** Confl ict takes place on a conscious level, competition is an unconscious activity.
- **(iii)** Confl ict is an intermittent process, competition is a continuous process.

- **(iv)** Competition is non-violent, confl ict may involve violence.
- **(v)** Confl ict disregards social norms, competition does care for these norms.
- **(vi)** Competition is impersonal, confl ict becomes personalized.

#### *Co-operation and Confl ict Go Together*

Th ere is a combination of co-operation and confl ict revealed in the relation of men and of groups. Th ey together exist in the human society just like the linked emotions of love and hate. Th e psychologists have shown how these two emotions may exist in the same individual. A child may love his mother for the satisfaction and pleasures she provides yet dislike her for the discipline she imposes. In the same way, co-operation and confl ict often go together.

According to Cooley, confl ict and co-operation are not separable things, but phases of one process which always involves something of both. Even in the friendliest relations and in the most intimate associations, there is some point where interests diverge or where attitudes are not in accord. Th ey cannot, therefore, co-operate beyond that point and confl ict is inevitable. Th e closest co-operation, for instance, within the family does not prevent the occurrence of quarrels. Cooley writes, 'Confl ict of some sort is the life of society, and progress emerges from a struggle in which each individual, class, or institution seeks to realise its own ideals of good. Th e intensity of this struggle varies with the vigour of the people, and its cessation, if conceivable, would be death'.

According to MacIver, 'Cooperation crossed by confl ict marks society wherever it is revealed'.

#### **Accommodation**

#### *Defi nition of Accommodation*

As discussed above, confl ict is a continuous though intermittent social process, but life cannot go long if groups are engaged in confl icts. Confl icts are exhausting if not annihilating. Th ese must, therefore, be resolved for making social life peaceful. Accommodation is resolution of confl icts, which generally means adjusting oneself to the new environment. Adjustment may be to the physical or social environment. Adjustment to the former takes place through organic or structural modifi cation transmitted by heredity and is termed *adaptation*, whereas adjustment to the latter is achieved by an individual through the acquisition of behaviour patterns transmitted to him socially and through the adoption of new ways of behaving, and is termed accommodation. Th us, animals lower than man, adjust themselves most frequently through adaptation; man does so chiefl y through accommodation as he lives in a truly social environment. Accommodation is a social process, adaptation is a biological process. According to J. M. Baldwin, accommodation denotes acquired changes in the behaviour of individuals that enables them to adjust to their environment. Some of the defi nitions of accommodation are as follows:

**(i) Reuter and Hart:** 'As a process, accommodation is the sequence of steps by which persons are reconciled to changed conditions of life through the formation of habits and attitudes made necessary by the changed conditions themselves'.

**(ii) MacIver:** 'Th e term accommodation refers particularly to the process in which man attains a sense of harmony with his environment'.

**(iii) Ogburn and Nimkoff :** 'Accommodation is a term used by the sociologists to describe the adjustment of hostile individuals or groups'.

**(iv) Lundberg:** 'Th e word accommodation has been used to designate the adjustments which people in groups make to relieve the fatigue and tensions of competition and confl ict'.

**(v) Gillin and Gillin:** 'Accommodation is the process by which competing and confl icting individuals and groups adjust their relationship to each other in order to overcome the diffi culties which arise in competition, contravention or confl ict'.

**(vi) Anderson and Parker:** 'Accommodation is the achievement of adjustment between people that permits harmonious acting together in social situations'.

#### *Forms or Methods of Accommodation*

Accommodation is social adaptation that involves the invention or borrowing of devices whereby the one ethnic group develops models of life, economic and otherwise, that complement or supplement those of the others. It is primarily concerned with the adjustment issuing from the confl ict between individuals and groups. In society, individuals have to resolve their confl icts sooner or later. Th is compromise reached by confl icting parties has been termed 'accommodation' by the sociologists. As Park and Burgess stated, in accommodation the antagonism between confl icting elements is temporarily regulated. Th is is why Summer referred to accommodation as 'antagonistic co-operation'. Accommodation or resolution of confl icts may be brought about in many diff erent ways and, accordingly, may assume various forms, the most important of them being the following:

**1. Yielding to coercion or admitting one's defeat:** Coercion means the use of force or the threat of force to terminate a confl ict. It usually involves parties of unequal strength, the weaker party yields because it has been over-powered or because of the fear of being over-powered. An armistice or peace treaty following a war is an example of this form of accommodation. In the case of actual outbreak of hostilities and use of force, confl ict comes to a close when one of the antagonists achieves a clear-cut victory over the other. Th e loser has to choose between submitting to the terms of peace imposed by the victor and continuing the confl ict with the risk of being eliminated altogether.

**2. Compromise:** When the combatants are of equal strength, neither may be able to prevail over the other, they attain accommodation by agreeing to a compromise. In compromise, each party to the dispute makes some concessions and yields to some demands of the other. Th e settlement of the parliament disputes involves accommodation of this kind.

**3. Arbitration and Conciliation:** Accommodation is also achieved by means of arbitration and conciliation, which involves attempts on the part of the third party to bring about an end of the confl ict between the contending parties. Th e labour management confl icts, the confl ict between husband and wife, and sometimes even the political confl icts are resolved through the intervention of an *arbitrator* or a *mediator*, in whom both the parties have full confi dence. In International law, mediation or arbitration is a recognized mode of settling international disputes.

 Diff erence should, however, be noted between mediation and arbitration. Mediation is the technique of bringing estranged individuals together and creating in the ill the willingness to consider the possible settlement of their diffi culty. Th e mediators may even suggest a basis for settlement in case the contestants themselves seem to have no common meeting ground. Th e suggestions made by the mediators have, however, no binding force. Arbitration diff ers from mediation in that a defi nite decision on the issue is handed down by the individuals who serve as arbitrators, and the decision is regarded as binding on the contestants.

**4. Toleration:** Toleration is the form of accommodation in which there is no settlement of diff erence, but there is only the avoidance of overt confl ict. Th e diff erences in such cases cannot be resolved as they involve irreconcilable ideologies. Toleration is best exemplifi ed in the fi eld of religion where the diff erent religious groups exist side by side.

**5. Conversion:** Conversion involves conviction on the part of one of the contending parties that it has been wrong and its opponent right. Th is process, thus, consists of repudiation of the beliefs of one party or allegiance and adoption of the other party. Ordinarily, conversion is thought of only in connection with religion, but it may also occur in politics, economics, and other fi elds.

**6. Rationalization:** Accommodation through rationalization involves plausible excuses or explanations for one's behaviours instead of acknowledging the real defect in one's own self. Not only individuals but also groups try to justify their action on purely imaginary grounds. Nazi Germany, for example, had advanced the reason for starting Second World War that the Allies were planning to destroy Germany. Similarly, Americans had justifi ed their participation in it by announcing that they wanted to free the world from fascism.

**7. Superordination and Subordination:** Th e most common accommodation is the establishment and recognition of the order of superordination and subordination. Th e organization of any society is essentially the result of such a type of accommodation. In the family, the relationships among parents and children are based in terms of superordination and subordination. In larger groupings, whether social or economic, the relationships are fi xed on the same basis. Even under a democratic order, there are leaders and followers who give order and those who obey. When individuals ordinarily accept their relative positions as a matter of fact, accommodation is said to have reached a state of perfection.

# **Assimilation**

#### *Defi nition of Assimilation*

Assimilation is the process whereby persons and groups acquire the culture of the other group in which they come to live, by adopting its attitudes and values, its patterns of thinking and behaving—in short, its way of life. Some of the defi nitions of assimilation are as follows:

**(i)** 'Assimilation is a process of interpenetration and fusion in which persons and groups acquire the memories, sentiments, attitudes of other persons or groups and by sharing their experiences and history are incorporated with them in a cultural life'. —*Park and Burgess* 

**(ii)** 'Assimilation is the social process whereby individuals or groups come to share the same sentiments and goals'. —*Biesanz* 

**(iii)** 'Assimilation is the process whereby individuals or groups once dissimilar become similar, and identifi ed in their interest and outlook'. —*Nimkoff* 

**(iv)** 'Assimilation is a word used to designate a process of mutual adjustment through which culturally diff erent groups gradually obliterate their diff erences to the point where they are no longer regarded as socially signifi cant or observable'. —*Lundberg* 

**(v)** 'Th e process of mutual cultural diff usion through which persons and groups come to share a common culture is called assimilation'. —*Horton and Hunt* 

Assimilation is not limited to single held only. Th e best example of assimilation is that of the foreigners being assimilated in the host culture, that is, their abandoning their own culture and taking on that of the host country. But it would be wrong to limit the process of assimilation to this single fi eld. Assimilation takes place in other cases also. For instance, children are gradually assimilated into adult society as they grow up and learn how to behave. Fostered children take in the new ways of their foster parents sometimes so completely that the traces of their earlier home-infl uence are eff aced. Husbands and wives, starting marriage with dissimilar backgrounds often develop a surprising unity of interest and purpose. In the religious fi eld, members of one faith may be brought into the fi eld of other by conversion.

### *Hindrances and Aids to Assimilation*

Assimilation is not a simple process, but it is complex and multi-faceted. Th ere are certain factors that facilitate assimilation and others that hinder or retard it. Th e rate of assimilation of a cultural minority depends on whether the facilitating or retarding factors predominate. According to Gillin and Gillin, 'factors favouring assimilation are toleration, equal economic opportunity, sympathetic attitude on the part of the dominating group towards the minority group, exposure to the dominant culture, similarity between the cultures of the minority and dominant groups and amalgamation or intermarriage. On the other hand, factors hindering or retarding assimilation are isolating conditions of life, attitudes of superiority on the part of the dominant group, excessive physiological, cultural and social diff erences between the groups and persecution of the minority groups by the majority groups'.

MacIver lists the following factors which may account for the ready acceptance of some groups and relative antagonism towards others:

**1. Th e state of the development of the society entered:** Th e nature of the immigrant's reception in the new land is dependent to a very large extent on the conditions existing at the time he enters. For instance, immigrants were most acceptable in America before 1880 when strength and skill of every kind were needed in the development of new lands and growing industries, but those coming in the years after 1880 have not been accepted with the same advantages—those entering after 1933 have been rather viewed as a threat to the economic well-being of the native workers.

**2. Background occupational skills:** Th e immigrant has a great advantage when he already possesses the skill and training in the work for which there is a need in the new country. For instance, the immigrants skilled in industries have better chances of being readily accepted in industrially undeveloped countries, and so have the people of rural background in countries of agrarian economy.

**3. Th e numbers involved:** It has been observed that the attitude of a group towards the outsiders tends to be tolerant until the latter's numbers reach large proportion. Th e larger the proportion of newcomers, the greater is the resistance of the established group to their integration.

**4. Physical diff erences:** Diff erences in features, complexion of skin, and other physical traits may also help or hinder in assimilation. Racial barrier hinders assimilation because while one can set aside one's culture, one cannot set aside one's skin. We can see discrimination between the White and the Negro races almost everywhere in the world. Generally, the adjustment problems are the easiest for those immigrants who in appearance are supposedly most like the people of the new land.

**5. Cultural diff erences:** Language and religion are usually considered to be the main constituents of culture. Immigrants having same the religion and language as the people of the country of their adoption can easily adjust themselves there. In America, for example, English speaking Protestants are assimilated with the greatest speed and ease, whereas non-Christians who do not

speak English, have the greatest diffi culty in being assimilated there. Customs and beliefs are other cultural characteristics that can aid or hinder assimilation.

**6. Th e role of semi-community:** Sometimes immigrants who come in large numbers settle in compact colonies where they continue to practise their native folkways instead of participating in the life around them. Such semi-communities play an important double role in the assimilation process. On the one hand, such a community, by retaining many features of the traditional way of life, enables the new comers to identify themselves with their fellowmen and adjust to the new conditions easily. On the other hand, the existence of such communities is viewed as alien and distasteful by the majority.

Assimilation, it may be noted, is a matter of degree. In a large society, complete assimilation is perhaps a hypothetical rather than a practically existing state of aff airs. Th e alien group continues to retain many of their social ways. Th e Indians who are settled abroad for a number of years still retain 'Indianness' and have not forsaken it altogether.

#### *Distinction Between Accommodation and Assimilation*

**(a) Assimilation is permanent, whereas accommodation is non-permanent:** Assimilation is a form of accommodation and is a more permanent method of adjusting inter group diff erences. Th e group with a cultural heritage diff erent from the one by which it is surrounded is sooner or later identifi ed with the latter on a more or less permanent basis. But in accommodation, diff erences among groups are not resolved permanently.

**(b) Assimilation is a slow process, whereas accommodation may be a sudden process:** A minor group when existing amidst major group is assimilated in the latter in due course. Th is process has to be slow, as it involves more intimate and subtle changes. Accommodation, on the other hand, may take place suddenly and involve radical changes as in the case of conversion.

**(c) Assimilation is unconscious activity, whereas accommodation is deliberate:** Assimilation takes place without any deliberate and conscious eff orts on the part of the groups involved in the process. As a matter of fact, in assimilation, the individual or group is unconscious of what is occurring and is incorporated into another culture before becoming aware of it. Accommodation, on the other hand, is the result of deliberate eff orts on the part of the parties concerned to reach a settlement, and is thus a conscious process.
