# Unit 2 Sociological Theories

# August Comte, Herbert Spencer, Emile Durkheim, and **Talcott Parsons**

#### **AUGUST COMTE**

August Comte lived from 1798 to 1857. He was born in France. At the age of 16, he enrolled in Ecole Polytechnic, a famous school of France at that time. The teachers of the school were scholars in natural sciences and had little interest in the study of human affairs and society. However, Comte had a serious interest in the study of society. He decided to study various theoretical sciences, which he identified as positive philosophy. With the help of such a study, he tried to formulate a system of laws governing the society. At the age of 19, and while he was still a student, he became secretary to a great social thinker named Saint Simon. From 1817 to 1823, Comte and Saint Simon worked closely together. However, after 1823, they began to attack each other and never worked together again.

In 1822, when Comte was working with Saint Simon, they conceived the necessity of a new science. They asserted that politics must become social physics, a branch of physiology; that each branch of knowledge must pass through three stages, the theological, the metaphysical, and the positive. Thus, the programme of a new science was clearly stated. The leading proposition of Comte's sociological theory was proclaimed—the law of three stages. In 1822, when Comte (with Saint Simon) conceived the necessity of a new science, he wrote, 'we possess now a celestial physics, a terrestrial physics, either mechanical or chemical, a vegetable physics and an animal physics; we still want one more and last one, social physics, to complete the system of our knowledge of nature. I understand by social physics the science which has for its subject, the study of social phenomena,

considered in the same spirit as astronomical, physical, chemical or physiological phenomena, that is, subject to natural invariable laws, the discovery of which is the special object of investigation'. Later, Comte reluctantly changed the name of the new science from social physics to sociology. In the latter part of his book *Positive Philosophy*, he explained that he had invented the new name because the old one was usurped by a Belgian scientist.

In *Positive Politics*, Comte attempted to give a clearer conception to the rather formal defi nition of sociology implied in *Positive Philosophy*. Initially, Comte's writings implied that the new science of sociology was the study of the totality of human intellect and its resulting social actions through time. Later, he qualifi ed this defi nition by stating, that sociology was not the study of intellect as such, but of the cumulative results of the exercise of intellect. Th is conception of social phenomena is similar to the concept of culture frequently employed by contemporary sociologists, who took it over from cultural anthropology.

#### **Methodology**

According to Comte, the new science of human society must use the positive method. By this method, he meant the subordination of concepts to facts and the acceptance of the idea that all social phenomena are subject to general laws—social laws. Comte was a student of mathematics, but he denied that the positive method could be identified with the use of mathematics and statistics. He believed that the positive knowledge could be gained through four methods, that is, observation, experiment, comparison, and historical method. According to him, observation should be guided by a theory of social phenomena. He believed in the use of observation to explain the variations of human behaviour. Comte was aware that actual experiment was not possible in the study of society. But in French language, experiment generally refers to controlled observation. He advocated the careful study of 'Pathological Cases' as the scientific equivalent of pure experimentation. He stressed the need of fruitful comparison for the study of social phenomena. He maintained that comparison could be carried out between the human and the animal societies, between coexisting societies, and between social classes in the same society. He explained that by this method, the different stages of evolution may all be observed at once. Comte maintained that these conventional methods of science—observation, experimentation, and comparison should be used in combination with the historical method. The historical method should be used to search the general laws governing the successive transformations of humanity through fixed, but limited number of stages. He insisted that we cannot understand a 'particular social phenomenon without the knowledge about its social context; for example, to understand the significance of a religion, one should understand the entire social and cultural context. There are two further points of methodological significance that need to be mentioned: (i) In Comte's opinion, society is similar to an organism in that the whole is better known than the parts. From this proposition, he came to a somewhat inconsistent conclusion that such specialized studies as economics are misleading because no social fact taken as an isolated phenomenon should be introduced into a science. (ii) In Comte's work there is a suggestion that anticipates, by more than 50 years, an outstanding contribution of Max Weber. Comte took social types to be 'limits to which social reality approaches closer and closer without being ever able to reach them'. In this statement, one perceives, in rudimentary form, Max Weber's ideal type, an excellent methodological tool for sociological analysis.

#### **Static and Dynamic Sociology**

Comte divided sociology into two major parts—static and dynamic. Th is division was taken over from biology, which was known at that time as physiology. According to Comte, 'the statical study of sociology consists in the investigation of the laws of action and reaction of the diff erent parts of the social system. Social dynamics, on the other hand, is the study of continuous movements in social phenomena through time'. He wrote in his book, *Positive Philosophy* that the distinction between the two is a distinction between the two aspects of the theory. It corresponds with the double conception of order and progress: for order consists in a permanent harmony among the conditions of social existence and progress consists in social development. Both statics and dynamics are essential for the study of society.

According to Comte, social statics is concerned with the analysis of the structure of society at any given moment as well as the analysis of elements, which at any given moment determines the consensus. Th e social statics is essential for understanding the nature of social order. On the other hand, social dynamics must be subordinated to social statics. Social dynamics consists of a description of the various stages for the development of mind and society with the help of historical analysis. Social dynamics is history, which is not concerned with individual names, rather it is history of a scientifi c nature in search of abstract social laws operative in mind arid society. Comte believed that social dynamics is concerned with human development and social progress. Progress is observable in all aspects of society—physical, moral, intellectual, and political.

#### **The Law of Three Stages**

Comte considered sociology to be a true science, which is concerned with the search of social laws. Based on his belief in social evolution, he puts forth the law of three stages. According to him, 'each of our leading conceptions, each branch of our knowledge, passes successively through three diff erent theoretical conditions: the theological or fi ctitious, the metaphysical or abstract, and the scientifi c or positive'. A brief description of these three stages is as follows:

**(a) Th eological or fi ctitious stage:** Priests and military dominate this stage. In this stage, man tries to understand the nature of all beings, origins, and purposes of all eff ects and the beliefs that all things are caused by supernatural beings. In this stage, all theoretical conceptions, whether general or special, bear a supernatural impress. Th e theological stage went through three phases of fetishism, polytheism, and monotheism.

**(b) Th e metaphysical or abstract stage:** Church and lawyers dominate this stage. At this stage, the mindless take into account the abstract forces and a belief that personifi ed abstractions is capable of producing all phenomena. Th is stage started about CE 1300 and was transitional and short-lived.

**(c) Th e positive or scientifi c stage:** Th is stage started in the beginning of the 19th Century in which observation predominated over imagination and all theoretical concepts became positive. Th e industrial administrators and scientists dominated this stage. At this stage, the human mind gives up the futile search for absolute notions, origin of the universe, and its causes; rather it seeks to 'establish scientifi c principles governing all types of phenomena.

According to Comte, corresponding to the three stages of mental progress, there are stages of society. Th e theological and metaphysical stages are dominated by military values. Th e positive stage marks the beginning of the industrial society. Th us, Comte refers to two major types of societies: the theological–military society, which was dying and scientifi c–industrial society, which was being

born during his lifetime. He believed that the new scientifi c–industrial society would become the society of all mankind. Th is is the fi nal stage in a series of successive transformations and each stage is defi nitely superior to the previous one.

# **Hierarchy of Sciences**

According to Comte, just like individuals and societies, sciences also pass through the same stages. As astronomy began in mystical speculation and developed through philosophy and fi nally reached the scientifi c method, similarly sociology has arrived at a point in which religious notions or metaphysical causes are not relevant. At the scientifi c stage, sociology is concerned with observation and analysis of all types of human relationships in the society.

Th e abstract and theoretical sciences are arranged in a hierarchy in which more concrete and complex sciences succeed the more general and abstract science. Mathematics is at the base of hierarchy followed by astronomy, because the positive method was fi rst adopted by these two sciences. Over a period of time, they were followed by mechanics, physics, chemistry, biology, and fi nally sociology.

Comte believed that the social sciences are at the top of the hierarchy because they enjoy all the resources of the anterior sciences and off er the attributes of a completion of the positive method. Th e positive method must prevail in history and politics roof of all sciences.

In establishing hierarchy of the sciences, Comte distinguished the methodological features of various sciences. Biology, which immediately precedes social sciences, employs a holistic methodology. Unlike physics and chemistry, which analyse individual elements, biology employs a holistic approach and proceeds from the study of organic wholes. According to Comte, in the inorganic sciences, the elements are much better known to us than the whole which they constitute; in that case we must proceed from the simple to the compound. But the reverse method is necessary in the study of man and society; man and society are better known to us and more accessible subjects of study than the parts which constitute them. Just as biology cannot explain an organ or a function without reference to the total organism, similarly, sociology cannot explain social phenomena without reference to the total social context. In the words of Comte, 'there can be no scientifi c study of society either in its conditions or its movements if it is separated into portions and its divisions are studied apart'.

# **HERBERT SPENCER**

Spencer was born in England in 1820. As a child he was weak and sickly. He never attended a regular school and was instructed at his home. By the age of 16, he was well trained in mathematics and natural sciences. But his major interest was in ethics and politics. His fi rst book, *Social Statics*, was published in 1852. Th is book was followed by another book named *First Principals* in 1862. Later on, his major works included multi-volume work *Principles of Biology* in 1865, then a multi-volume work called *Principles of Psychology* in 1872, followed by multi-volume work entitled *Principles of Sociology* in 1896. He had also written an eight-volume study *Descriptive Sociology* (1873–1894) as well as the highly acclaimed *Th e Study of Sociology* in 1873. His major contributions have been described below:

#### **Science and Society**

Like Comte, Spencer believed in and worked for a science of society, which they both argued to be possible because they thought society was an order of coexistence and progress. Where there is order, the components of that order may constitute the subject of a science. Th is social science (sociology) is the science of what Spencer called the super-organic, that is, social evolution. He divided all the phenomena in the universe into three categories, that is, inorganic, organic, and super-organic. Sociology, according to him, was concerned with the super-organic or the socio-cultural phenomena.

Although for both Comte and Spencer, sociology was a positive science, but there were diff erences of opinion between two of them regarding the function of the new science of society in the modern state. Whereas Comte wanted sociology to guide men in building a better society in which to live, Spencer was of the view that the new science should not interfere with the natural process occurring within the society. Th ere is a tendency within all natural phenomena to improve, and society being a natural phenomenon, is no exception. Spencer, like Comte had perceived the signifi cant role of history for the new science of society. In the words of Spencer, 'Th at which it really concerns us to know is the natural history of society. Th e only history that is of practical use is what may be called Descriptive Sociology'. According to Spencer, history, if done well, is essentially sociology, a careful description of social phenomena in evolution.

#### **Organic Analogy**

Spencer took great pains to elaborate in great detail the organic analogy, which is the identifi cation of a society with biological organism. He regarded the recognition of the similarity between society and organism as the fi rst step towards a general theory of evolution. In the words of Spencer, 'So completely is a society organised on the same system as an individual being, that we may perceive something more than an analogy between them, the same defi nition of life applies to both'. Spencer noted several similarities between biological and social organisms, which are as follows:

**(i)** Both society and organism are distinguished from inorganic matter by visible growth during the greater part of their existence.

**(ii)** As societies and organisms grow in size, they also increase in complexity of structure.

**(iii)** Both in societies and organisms, progressive diff erentiation of structure is accompanied by progressive diff erentiation of functions.

**(iv)** Evolution establishes, for both societies and organisms, diff erences in structure and function that make each other possible.

**(v)** Just as a living organism may be regarded as a nation of units that live individually, so a nation of human beings may be regarded as an organism.

After describing the analogy, Spencer also described the diff erences between the society and organism. According to him, the parts of an animal form a concrete whole, but the parts of society form a whole which is discrete. While the living units composing the organism are combined together in close contact, the living units composing the society are free, are not in contact, and are more or less widely dispersed. Spencer continued to use the organic analogy as a scientifi c premise to build his theory of evolution.

Spencer tried to pinpoint the similarities and diff erences between organic and social life, but denied that he held the doctrine of organic analogy. In his words, 'I have used the analogies, but only as a scaffolding to help in building up a coherent body of sociological induction. Let us take away the scaff olding: the inductions will stand by themselves'. However, Spencer consistently used the terminology of organism in his writings. One chapter of his book *Principles of Sociology*, is entitled 'Society is an Organism'.

#### **Theory of Evolution**

Th e major concern of Spencer was with evolutionary changes in social structures and social institutions. According to him, the evolution of human society, far from being diff erent from other evolutionary phenomenon, is but a special case of universally applicable natural law. Ultimately, all universal phenomena, inorganic and superorganic, are subject to the natural law of evolution.

According to Spencer, 'Evolution is an integration of matter and concomitant dissipation of motion; during which the matter passes from an indefi nite, incoherent homogeneity to a defi nite, coherent heterogeneity; and during which the retained motion undergoes a parallel transformation'. Within this framework of universal evolution, Spencer developed his three basic laws and his four secondary propositions, each building upon each and all upon the doctrine of evolution. Th e three basic laws are (i) the law of persistence of force; (ii) the law of the indestructibility of matter, and (iii) the law of continuity of motion. Th e four secondary propositions are (i) persistence of the relationship between the force, (ii) transformation and equivalence of forces, (iii) tendency of everything to move along the line of least resistance and greatest attraction, and (iv) the principle of the alteration or rhythm of motion.

Th ere are two distinct and interrelated aspects of Spencer's theory of evolution:

**1. Th e movement from simple societies to various levels of compound societies:** Spencer identifi ed four types of societies in terms of their evolutionary stages—simple, compound, doubly compound, and trebly compound, each being distinguishable on the basis of more or less complexity of their social structures and functions. Th ere is an inherent tendency for the homogeneous to become heterogeneous and for the uniform to become multiform.

**2. Change from military to industrial society:** Th is view point of society states that types of social structure depend on the relation of a society to other societies in its signifi cant environment. Th us, the evolution is from military to industrial societies, the former characterized by 'compulsory co-operation', whereas the latter is based on 'voluntary co-operation'. Th e military society is also characterized by a centralized government, a rigid system of stratifi cation, economic autonomy, and state domination of all social organizations. Th e chief characteristics of an industrial society are free trade, laws of economic autonomy, independent voluntary organization, relatively open system of stratifi cation, and a decentralized government.

A question related to Spencer's writings is, whether he believed that evolution, which was the law of becoming, was directed towards progress. Spencer did not hold the view that evolution necessarily leads to progress. In Spencer's words, 'the doctrine of evolution is erroneously supposed to imply some intrinsic proclivity in every species towards a higher form. Similarly, many make the erroneous assumption that the transformation which constitutes evolution implies an intrinsic tendency to go through those changes which the formula of evolution expresses'. But, according to him, the progress of evolution is not necessary; it depends on certain conditions. Th e frequent occurrence of dissolution (process opposed to evolution), the movement of the multiform to the uniform, shows that where essential conditions are not maintained the reverse process takes place. Th us, it will be wrong to assume that Spencer claimed the ever-presence of evolution or the notion that evolution necessarily leads to progress. However, Spencer believed that man by his very nature was predestined to progress.

Spencer stated that societies need not necessarily pass through the identical stages of evolution or become exactly one like the other. He maintained that there were diff erences between the individual societies due to disturbances that interfered with the straight line of evolution. He refers to fi ne possible disturbances which are as follows:

- **(i)** A somewhat diff erent original endowment of the races.
- **(ii)** Th e eff ect due to the impact of the immediately preceding stage of evolution.
- **(iii)** Th e peculiarities of habit.
- **(iv)** Th e position of a given society in the framework of a larger community of societies.
- **(v)** Th e impact of the mixture of races.

#### **Social Darwinism**

Social Darwinism is an attempt to apply Darwin's theory of evolution, dealing with the development of plants and animals, to social phenomena. Herbert Spencer and Summer were the two most outspoken advocates of social Darwinism in sociology.

Spencer's social Darwinism is centred on two fundamental principles that are discussed below:

**(i) Th e principle of the survival of the fi ttest:** Spencer fully endorsed the natural process of confl ict and survival that operates as a kind of biologically purifying process. According to him, nature is endowed with a providential tendency to get rid of unfi t and to make room for the better; it is the law of nature that the weak should be eliminated for the sake of strong.

**(ii) Th e principle of non-interference:** Spencer was a serious advocate of individualism and laissez-faire politics. He opposed almost any form of state interference with private activity. He insisted that the state had no business in education, health, sanitation, postal services, money and banking, regulation of housing conditions, or the elimination of poverty. For Spencer, the state was a sort of joint-stock company whose only role was the protection of the rights of the individual and defence of its citizens against external aggression. Spencer was of the opinion that sociologists should convince the state and the citizens not to intervene in the natural process of selection operative in the society. In his words, 'nature is more intelligent than man and once you begin to interfere with the order of nature, there is no knowing where the result will end'.

#### **Functionalism**

Spencer was a thoroughgoing functionalist as well as an evolutionist. According to him, 'Th ere can be no true conception of a structure without a true conception of its function'. Function occurs within a social structure and all social structures must have functions. He explained, 'To understand how an organisation originated and developed, it is requisite to understand the need observed by it at the outset and afterwards'. He believed that social institutions are not the result of deliberate intentions and motivations of actors, but arise from the exigencies of social structures and functions. According to him, any serious sociological analysis of social institutions must necessarily employ both the concepts of social evolution and social function. He emphasized that changes in structure cannot occur without changes in functions, and that increases in the size of social units necessarily bring in their wake progressive diff erentiations in social activities. Spencer combined his functionalism with evolutionism. According to him, if the society is to evolve into higher and more advanced social structures and functions, it must move from the simple to the complex activities, which is moving from the lesser military to the more industrial activities.

# **EMILE DURKHEIM**

Emile Durkheim was a French sociologist. He lived from 1858 to 1917. He did his graduation from Paris after which he travelled to Germany for studying economics, folklore, and cultural anthropology. In 1887, he was appointed professor at the University of Bordeaux where he taught the fi rst course in sociology ever off ered in any French university. In his writings and in his thoughts, he was deeply infl uenced by August Comte, Saint Simon, and to some extent by Herbert Spencer. Th e main contributions of Durkheim include the concept of social facts, division of labour, suicide, and sociology of religion. Th ese contributions have been discussed below.

## **Social Facts**

Th e methodology of Durkheim can be explained with reference to his concept of social facts. According to him, there are some facts in social life that cannot be explained in terms of physical or psychological analysis. Th ese social facts have distinctive social characteristics and determinants. Th e social facts constitute the subject matter of sociology. According to Durkheim, there are two important features of social facts.

**(a) Exteriority:** Social facts are external to any particular individual considered as a biological entity. Th ey continue to persist over a period of time while particular individuals die and are replaced by others. Th ere are certain ways of action, thinking, and feeling that are external to the individual; for example, the principles of public morality, family, and religious observances, etc.

**(b) Coercion:** Th e social facts have coercive power, that is, they impose themselves upon the individual, independent of his own will. Durkheim gives a number of examples that show the element of coercion in social phenomena; for example, in a gathering or a crowd, a feeling imposes itself on everyone or there is a collective reaction. Coercive power of social facts comes into force whenever social demands are violated; for example, the means of social control like law or custom immediately come into operation in case of such violation. However, in his later writings, Durkheim changed his views regarding external constraints. He admitted that some social facts, particularly the moral rules, become internalized in the consciousness of individuals, and then act as eff ective guides and controls of conduct.

Durkheim defi ned social fact as 'Every way of acting, fi xed or not, capable of exercising on the individual an external constraint'. According to him, social facts should be regarded as things. We do not know in scientifi c sense, the social phenomena that surrounds us; for example, as a layman, we do not have scientifi c knowledge about the terms like state, sovereignty, democracy, socialism, or communism. We generally have a vague and confused idea regarding them. When we learn to regard social facts as things we can avoid the preconceptions and prejudices that hinder the scientifi c knowledge about these facts. Moreover, we must observe social facts from outside, that is, we should gain knowledge about them through objective and scientifi c research. We can discover them as we discover physical facts. Th e social facts are general in character because they are collective. According to Durkheim, social fact is any way of behaving which is universal throughout a given society and has an existence of its own, independent of its individual manifestations.

# **Division of Labour**

Th e view of Durkheim about division of labour have been deeply infl uenced by August Comte. Durkheim starts with the analysis of relationship between individuals and connectivity. In this  analysis, he distinguishes between two forms of solidarity, that is, mechanical and organic. Mechanical solidarity is a solidarity of resemblances. Th e major characteristic of a society marked by such solidarity is its homogeneity, that is, individuals in such a society diff er from one another as little as possible. Th e individuals in this type of society have similar emotions, values, and beliefs. On the other hand, in a society marked by organic solidarity, there is a remarkable social diff erentiation. However, even in this type of society there is a coherent unity of the collectivity that is based on consensus. Th e primitive societies are characterized by mechanical solidarity and are called segmental societies. On the other hand, modem societies are characterized by organic solidarity and have an elaborate division of labour. In a segmental society, the individuals are strongly attached to particular social groups and are more or less separated from the outside world. Th us, the segmental organization is contrary to the general phenomena of diff erentiation designated by the term organic solidarity. However, Durkheim concedes that in certain societies that might have advanced forms of economic division of labour, the segmental structure may still persist to some extent. Th e division of labour that Durkheim tried to defi ne and explain should not be confused with the one explained by the economists. According to Durkheim, diff erentiation of occupation and multiplication of industrial activities are an expression of social diff erentiation that precedes the economic diff erentiation. Th e origin of social diff erentiation leads to the disintegration of mechanical solidarity and movement of the society towards organic solidarity, which is characterised by a complex division of labour.

#### **Suicide**

Durkheim related the problem of suicide to his study of division of labour. To some extent, he approves of the phenomena of organic division of labour and regards it as a welcome development in human society. However, he also notes that the individual is not properly satisfi ed with his lot in the modern societies, and hence there is an increase in the number of suicides. Th e increase in the number of suicides is considered by him as an expression of certain pathological features of modern societies.

Durkheim considers suicide not as an individual, but as a social phenomenon. Apparently, suicide seems to be the most personal matter of an individual because nothing may be considered more personal than the decision to take one's own life. Durkheim argued that the decision of an individual to commit suicide is taken because of certain social forces. He tries to bring out the relationship between suicide as an individual phenomenon and the suicide rate as a social phenomenon. He found that suicide rate, that is, frequency of suicide in a given population, is relatively consistent. It does not vary arbitrarily; rather it varies as a result of many circumstances. According to him, sociology must establish correlations between the circumstances and variations in suicide rates.

Durkheim does not accept the psychological explanations for suicide. In order to prove his view point, he examines variations in the suicide rate in diff erent populations; for example, he considers various religions and remarks that the proportion of neurotic or insane persons among Jews is particularly high, whereas suicide rate among them is quite low. Th us, he comes to the conclusion that there is no correlation between the psychological factors and suicide rates.

Durkheim has explained three types of suicide:

**(a) Egoist:** Th ose people who think primarily of themselves and are not integrated into a social group are prone to egoist suicide. In order to explain this type of suicide, he establishes correlations between the suicide rate and integrating social contexts such as religion and family. On the basis of this correlation, he comes to certain conclusions.

(i) Suicide rate increases with age.

- (ii) It is higher among men than in women.
- (iii) It is higher among Protestant Christians as compared to Catholic Christians.
- (iv) It is higher among childless women.

**(b) Altruistic:** When the individual is so much attached to the group that he loses his personal identity, he is prone to this type of suicide; for example, practice of Sati in India. Suicide can also take place due to an internalized social imperative; for example, the captain of a sinking ship prefers to die than to leave it. Similarly, Durkheim fi nds that in some professional organizations like the army, the suicide rate is higher due to disappearance of individual identity in the group.

**(c) Anomie:** When there are abnormal conditions and breakdown of norms, individuals are prone to this type of suicide; for example, suicide rate goes up both in times of economic crisis and extreme prosperity. Durkheim explains this type of suicide in terms of crisis created by social disintegration and the weakening of group norms, which bind the individual to the group; for example, the suicide rate increases with the increase in the divorce rate.

#### **Sociology and Religion**

Durkheim defi ned religion as 'Unifi ed system of beliefs and practices related to sacred things'. Th e sacred things are those that are set apart and forbidden. What makes any object 'sacred' is not based on its basic properties, but rather an attitude towards it. Th e sacred things are symbols and their signifi cance lies in what they symbolize and not what they are. Durkheim distinguishes sacred from the profane, which is the realm of every day. Sacred refers to the holy realm that is viewed with reverence. Th e sacred things are set apart by a peculiar emotional attitude of respect and awe. Th e sacred things are considered to possess special powers, are reserved for special occasions, and a number of restrictions are attached with them. Th e profane or the ordinary includes whatever is not viewed with these emotions, that is, regarding which there are no such restrictions. Profane includes those ideas, persons, practices, and things that are regarded with everyday attitude of commonness, utility, and familiarity.

According to Durkheim, 'religion is an eminently collective thing'. Religion is regarded by him as a creation of society and he thinks that religion refl ects all aspects of society, even the most vulgar and the most repulsive. He maintained that religion is a social necessity and will be present in one form or another respective of the changes that might take place in the organization of the society.

Durkheim distinguished between the two major aspects of religion, beliefs, and rituals. Belief is the cognitive aspect of religion—it attempts to explain the nature and origin of sacred things and implicitly assumes that they exist. Th e religious beliefs are based upon faith rather than evidence. Durkheim, therefore, emphasised that religion cannot be studied merely as system of beliefs. Th e religious ritual is the active side of religion. Beliefs can neither be observed nor verifi ed unless they are expressed in ritual actions. Ritual, moreover, involves, the society, which according to Durkheim is the main concern of sociology. He, therefore, emphasizes that the study of rituals is essential for the scientifi c understanding of religion.

With regard to the origin of religion, Durkheim believes that its absolute origin can never be found. At the most, we can describe the simplest social condition that is actually known and beyond which we cannot go at present. In his search for the simplest social condition, he concentrated upon an analysis of religion as found among the Australian tribes. He propounded his theory of religion in his book '*Elementary Forms of Religious Life'*. He rejected the viewpoint held by the earlier  anthropologists that religion must involve a belief in goods or in spiritual beings. He attributed the beginning of religion to ritualistic activities which he considered as the most elementary form of religion. According to Durkheim, the primitive men like many people in civilized societies had an important need to escape daily routine and dullness of everyday life. Th erefore, primitive people periodically gathered for some celebrations during which their passions ran high and they reached a stage of ecstasy. Th e most important activities were group dancing and singing which led to intensifi cation of sentiments so that the group felt that it possessed extraordinary powers. Th is is the elementary emotion attached to religion.

## **TALCOTT PARSONS**

Parsons is acknowledged as the most outstanding theorist of contemporary functionalism. He was born in 1902 in the United States and was greatly infl uenced by European Scholars. He was a graduate student at the London School of Economics and studied with the sociologists L. T. Hobhouse, Morris Ginsberg, and the anthropologist Malinowski who aroused his interest in the functional approach.

Th e two major contributions of Talcott Parsons are (i) action frame of reference and its components, and (ii) the structural-functional analysis. Parsons' book, *Th e Structure of Social Action* (1937) is considered as the 'watershed in the development of American sociology in general and Sociological theory in particular. It was a landmark in that it set a new Course—the course of functional analysis'. Another book, *Social System* (1951) emphasized the 'importance of institutionalized values and norms and diff erentiated social roles corresponding to diff erent status position'.

- **1. Action frame:** According to Talcott Parsons, there are four elements of action:
  - (i) An actor (may be an individual or collectivity)
  - (ii) An end
  - (iii) A situation
  - (iv) Means

As such, any action is determined by three systems

- (i) Personality system
- (ii) Social system
- (iii) Cultural system

 Of these three, the cultural system consisting of values, norms, and symbols is the most important Th ese three are not interchangeable, though they inter-penetrate each other and are essential for each other. Th us, they are separate yet related aspect of reality.

 From his action frame of reference, Parsons derived his concept of pattern variables. According to him, there are fi ve basic pattern variables:

- (i) Aff ectivity-aff ective neutrality (the gratifi cation–discipline dilemma).
- (ii) Self-orientation collectivity orientation (Th e private vs. collective interest dilemma).
- (iii) Universalism-particularism (Th e choice between the types of value orientation standard)
- (iv) Ascription-achievement (Th e choice between modalities of social object)
- (v) Specifi city-diff useness (Th e defi nition and scope of interest in the subject)

**2. Th e structural-functional analysis:** Parsons used the structural functional method in the study of social phenomena. Th e structural-functional analysis revolves around the two concepts of functions and structures. Th e basic questions involved are: (a) what basic functions are fulfi lled in any given system, (b) by what structures, and (c) under what conditions. While functions deal with the consequences involving objectives as well as processes of patterns of actions, structures refer to those arrangements within the system which perform the functions.

Talcott Parsons has mentioned four types of functional requisites as essential for the survival of a social system. Th ese are (i) pattern maintenance and tension management, (ii) goal attainment, (iii) adaptation, and (iv) integration.

Pattern maintenance means maintenance of the basic patterns of values, institutionalized in the society. Th e leading institutions that perform this function are family, education, and religion. Tension management means removal of confl icts and society. Judicial system is the chief instrument of tension management. No society can operate unless it sets certain goals towards which the social activities of its members are directed. Th e state or the political system prescribes these goals and the means to achieve them. Adaptation refers to the relationship between social system and its environment. Economy is the institution charged with this responsibility. Integration refers to the co-ordination and adjustment of parts of the social system. Law is the main instrument of integration. Legal norms defi ne and regulate relations between individuals, individuals and groups, between group and between individuals and formal organizations, including the state.
