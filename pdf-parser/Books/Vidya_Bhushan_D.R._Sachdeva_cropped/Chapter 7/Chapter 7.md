# Unit 3 Social Institutions

# **7 Family and Kinship**

Of all the human groups, family is the most important primary group. It is a small social group consisting ordinarily of a father, a mother, and one or more children.

# **MEANING OF FAMILY**

Some of the defi nitions of family are as follows:

**(i)** 'Family is a group defi ned by a sex relationship suffi ciently precise and enduring to provide for the procreation and upbringing of children'. —*MacIver* 

**(ii)** 'Family is a more or less durable association of husband and wife with or without children, or of a man or woman alone, with children'. —*Nimkoff* 

**(iii)** 'Family is a group of persons whose relations to one another are based upon consanguinity and who are therefore, kin to another'. —*Davis* 

**(iv)** 'Family is the biological social unit composed of husband, wife and children'.

—*Eliot and Merrill* 

On the basis of these defi nitions, the following characteristics of a family may be deducted.

**(i) A mating relationship:** A family comes into existence when a man and a woman establish a mating relation between them. Th is relation may be of a shorter duration or lifelong. When the marital relations break up, the family disintegrates.

**(ii) A form of marriage:** Mating relationship is established through the institution of marriage, which may be solemnized in a simple way as is the case in Europe, or its celebration may be a long process as is generally in India.

**(iii) A system of nomenclature:** Every family is known by a name and has its own system of reckoning descent. Descent may be reckoned through the male line or through the female line. Usually, the wife goes and joins her husband's relatives, but sometimes the husband may also go and join his wife's relatives.

**(iv) An economic provision:** Every family needs an economic provision to satisfy the economic needs. Th e head of the family works to earn money to maintain the family.

**(v) A common habitation:** A family requires a house for its living. Without a dwelling place the task of child bearing and child rearing cannot be adequately performed.

Th e family, thus, is a biological unit implying institutionalized sex relationship between husband and wife.

# **NATURE OF FAMILY**

Besides the characteristics mentioned above, a family is possessed of several distinctive features.

**(i) Universality:** Family is the most universal group. It is the fi rst institution in the history of mankind. It has existed in every age and in every society and is found in all parts of the world. No culture or society has ever existed without some form of family organization. Each one of us is a member of a family. No other group is so universal as the family is.

**(ii) Emotional basis:** Th e family is a fundamental unit of human society. It is based on our impulses of mating, procreation, and parental care. It is a close-knit group that fortifi es these emotions.

**(iii) Limited size:** A family is usually a small-sized organization. Its size is generally defi ned by biological conditions, which it cannot transcend. Other groups may be smaller than a family, but they are not formed because of biological conditions.

**(iv) Formative infl uence:** Th e family exercises the most profound infl uence over its members. It moulds the character of individuals. Its infl uence in infancy determines the personality structure of the individual. From its initial units, the father and mother, the child receives his/her physical inheritance. Freud and other psychologists have proved that a child exhibits the same character and mental tendencies in adult age that he acquires in the family. Confucius rightly remarked that if you want to improve society, improve family. 'To be well born is to possess the greatest of all gifts. To be ill born there is nothing which this world can aff ord that will be adequate compensation for the lack of good heredity'.

**(v) Nuclear position:** Th e family is the nucleus of all other social groups. Th e distinctive characteristics of marriage, parental obligations, and sibling relations make family the primary institutional cell of a society. Th e whole social structure is built of family units.

**(vi) Responsibility of the members:** In the family the child learns the meaning of social responsibility and the necessity for co-operation. As MacIver aptly describes, 'In times of crisis men may work, and fi ght and die for their country, but they toil for their families all their lives. In it, the child develops his basic attitudes and ideals. It is a great agency of the socialisation of the child'.

**(vii) Social regulation:** Th e family is peculiarly guarded by social customs and legal regulations. It is not easy to violate them. Family is the group in which the consenting parties may freely enter, but which they cannot easily leave or dissolve. Marriages are not trivially taken.

**(viii) Permanent and temporary:** Family as an institution is permanent and universal, while as an association it is temporary and transitional. When the son marries, he goes out of the family and starts another family, which again may give rise to more families.

All this tends to show that although the family is one of the most limited groups of the society, it diff ers from all of them in being a distinct type of group. It is the smallest kinship group. It usually begins when the partners marry; it changes when the sons marry, it ends when one of the partners dies. When the children are young and entirely dependent on parents, the family looks like a compact human group. When children grow in age, this compactness becomes loose and when they marry the old family disintegrates and new families rise up. Th e original relations are reversed, the parents become dependent on the children.

# **FORMS OF FAMILY**

Families may be classifi ed variously, as follows:

**1. On the basis of authority** a family may be patriarchal or matriarchal.

**(i) Th e patriarchal family:** Under the patriarchal family the male head of the family is possessed of inclusive powers. He is the owner and administrator of the family property; to him all persons living in the family are subordinated. He presides over the religious rites of the family. In short, the father or the eldest male descendant is the protector and ruler of the family, enjoying full authority over the family members.

Th e chief characteristics of a patriarchal family are the following:

- **(a)** Th e wife after marriage comes to live in the husband's house.
- **(b)** Th e father is the supreme lord of the family property.
- **(c)** Descent is reckoned through the father. Th e children are known by the name of their father.
- **(d)** Th e children can inherit the property of their father only.

Th ey have no right over the property of the mother's family.

**(ii)** Th e matriarchal family: MacIver prefers to call it by the name of maternal family rather than the matriarchal family. In a matriarchal family, the authority vests in the woman head of the family with the males being subordinate. She is the owner of the property and rules over the family. Th ere are grave doubts whether this type of family ever existed in society, although L. H. Morgan, McLennan, and Bachopen believe it to have been the earliest form of family. Bachopen maintained that in early times, mankind lived in a state of promiscuity and that the earliest type of family was the matriarchal. Morgan referred to as the 'father of American

anthropology' postulated that the family evolved through various stages, from the lowest promiscuity to the highest monogamy. Th e chief characteristics of matriarchal family are the following:

**(a)** Descent is reckoned through the mother and·not the father, because maternity is a fact, whereas paternity is only an opinion.

**(b)** Marriage relations are transient. Th e husband is sometimes merely a casual visitor.

**(c)** Th e children are brought up in the home of the wife's relatives.

**(d)** Th e authority in the family rests in the hands of the wife or in the hands of some representative of the wife's kin.

**(e)** Property is transferred through the mother and only females succeed to it.

The matriarchal family is said to prevail among the primitive people who led their lives as wanderers or hunters. The father roamed far and wide, coming home irregularly and staying away for long periods of time. The absence of the father from the home made it necessary for the woman to 'stay on the job'. She was the leader of the clan for a great deal of time. Hence, she came to possess authority in the family. Briffault is of the opinion that the earliest form of family was matriarchal and that the patriarchal type emerged only with the development of agriculture and economic dominance of men.

However, the fact that women in earlier times possessed positions of authority is not a conclusive evidence of matriarchal system. On the basis of the fact that Britain is ruled by Queen Elizabeth II and India has Mrs Pratibha Patil as the president, we cannot conclude that the form of family in Britain and India is matriarchal. Also, the view that under matriarchal system the position of women is better than under the patriarchal regime is not correct. Today, matrilineal system prevails among some groups such as Trobiand Islanders, American Iroquois, the Veddas of Ceylon, and some African tribes, but this should not be taken to mean that mother rules the family. Th e woman under matrilineal system is merely the agent of transmission and not the active wielder of power. It is simply recognition of 'mother-right' and not of 'mother-rule'.

Th e organization of matrilineal or matriarchal family is not similar among the tribes where it prevails. In India, the Nairs in Kerala and the Khasis and Garos in Assam are matrilineal people. Th e Khasi family is distinct from the Garo family. In the South-west the matrilineal organization diff ers from that in the North-east. Th e Khasis have matrilocal residence and matrilineal descent. Property is transmitted through the females and·is held by the females alone. However, the family property is indivisible. Among the Garos too, the descent is matrilineal and residence matrilocal. Property passes through the female, but all female members do not share in the family property. Th e parents appoint one of the daughters as the heir, and she need not be the eldest or youngest child. Although the woman owns the property, it is controlled by the husband.

**2. On the basis of structure** the family can be classifi ed as nuclear and extended family.

A nuclear family is one which consists of a husband, a wife, and their children. Th e children leave the parental household after marriage. A nuclear family is an autonomous unit free from the control of the elders.

An extended family can be viewed as a merger of several nuclear families. Th us, a small extended family may include grandparents, their son, the son's wife, and the son's children. A large extended family may include multiple generations in the family. Grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins, their unmarried children, married sons and their wives along with their married/unmarried children live together within the same household..

Th ere are two important features of an extended family. First, an extended family is continuous, whereas a nuclear family is not. In an extended family, a person is a member of a residential kin group that has probably persisted for many generations. Second, while a nuclear family is, to some degree, a separate and independent unit run by husband, wife, or both, an extended family is usually run by the patriarch. Its constituent nuclear families may have little power for independent decision-making.

- **3. On the basis of residence** the family may be classifi ed as follows:
  - **(i) Matrilocal family:** In this type of family, the husband goes to live in the house of his wife.

**(ii) Patrilocal family:** In this kind of family, the wife goes and lives in the house of her husband.

**4. On the basis of marriage** the family may be classifi ed as follows:

**(i) Monogamous family:** In which one man marries only one woman at one time.

**(ii) Polygamous family:** In this kind of family, one man marries many women at one time.

**(iii) Polyandrous family:** In this kind of family, one woman marries many men and lives with all of them or with each of them alternately.

**5. On the basis of ancestry** the family is classifi ed into (i) matrilineal and (ii) patrilineal.

In the matrilineal family mother is the basis of ancestry. A woman is believed to be the ancestor of the family. Th e rights of each member of the family depend on his relation to the mother.

In the patrilineal family, ancestry continues through the father. Th is is the common type of family prevalent today.

**6. On the basis of in-group and out-group affi liation** a family may be classifi ed into endogamous family and exogamous family. An endogamous family is one that sanctions marriage only among the members of the in-group, whereas an exogamous family sanctions marriage of members of an in-group with the members of an out-group.

**7. On the basis of blood relationships:** A family may be conjugal family or consanguineous family. A conjugal family consists of spouses, their off spring, and relatives through marriage.

A consanguineous family consists of blood relatives together with their mates and children.

It may also be pointed out that the patriarchal or patrilineal or patrilocal family is more common than the matriarchal or matrilineal or matrilocal family. Th e matrilineal family among the Khasis is also undergoing the process of disintegration, which is partly due to the infl uence of Christianity and partly due to the migration, of educated Khasis to the cities. Although it may also be said that the patriarchal family, in traditional sense, has also changed in its nature on account of the new social and economic forces, particularly the women's liberation movement, yet the fact still remains that family system is patriarchal in the greater parts of the world.

#### **FUNCTIONS OF THE FAMILY**

Davis has characterized the main social functions of the family into four divisions: reproduction, maintenance, placement, and socialization of the young. It also performs individual functions, but these are a corollary of its social functions.

Lundberg has enumerated the following basic functions of the family:

(i) Th e regulation of sexual behaviour and reproduction. (ii) Care and training of children. (iii) Co-operation and division of labour. (iv) Primary group satisfactions.

Besides, there are many auxiliary functions as well. Ogburn and Nimkoff have divided family functions into six categories: (i) Aff ectional, (ii) Economic, (ill) Recreational, (iv) Protective, (v) Religious, and (vi) Educational.

Reed has described the following functions of the family: (i) Race perpetuation, (ii) Socialization, (iii) Regulation and satisfaction of sex needs, (iv) Economic functions.

MacIver divides the functions of the family into two categories—essential and non-essential. Under the essential he includes three functions: (i) stable satisfaction of sex need, (ii) production and rearing of children, and (iii) provision of a home.

Under the non-essential functions he mentions religious, educational, economic, health, and recreation which, he says, have now been transferred to specialized agencies in society.

#### **Essential Functions**

**(i) Satisfaction of sex need:** Th is is the fi rst essential function that the family performs. Manu, the Ancient Indian law-giver, regarded sexual satisfaction as the aim of family; Vatsyayan also looked upon sexual satisfaction as the primary objective of the family. Satisfaction of sex instinct brings the desire for lifelong partnership among males and females. Th e satisfaction of sex instinct makes for normal personality. If sex instinct is suppressed, it may produce personality maladjustments and disrupt social relations. According to Havelock, 'With failure of sexual harmony, the marriage structure rests on shifting sand'. Th e modern family satisfi es this instinct in greater degree than the traditional family. In the traditional family the sexual act was combined with reproduction. Th e fear of pregnancy, as a result of intercourse, prevented the couple to satisfy their sex urge. But in the modern families the task of sexual satisfaction has been eased by the invention of contraceptives and other methods of birth control. Th e present wife is in a better position to satisfy sex instinct without any fear of conception.

 It may be referred that while premarital or extramarital mating is permitted or tolerated in some societies, however, every society places some restrictions on such mating; although these restrictions may vary from culture to culture. No society is entirely promiscuous. It may also be noted that premarital mating is not uncommon in a society that by law as well as custom prohibits all sexual relations except those between husband and wife. Many societies regard the idea of virgin marriage as absurd. In such societies, premarital sex experience is viewed as a preparation for marriage, not as a recreational pastime. Its purpose is generally to determine fertility. Most of these societies have not merely allowed premarital sexual behaviour, they have rather institutionalized it.

**(ii) Production and rearing of children:** Th e inevitable result of sexual satisfaction is procreation. Th e task of race perpetuation has always been an important function of the family. Th e Hindu scriptures hold that the religious activities of man cannot be consummated unless he has a son. Th ey permit a second marriage if there is no issue from the fi rst wife. In the Hindu marriage, the groom says to his bride that 'I accept you in order to obtain good progeny'. Although childbirth can occur outside the family, nowhere is illegitimacy approved. Family is an institution par excellence for the production and rearing of children. Some countries, especially Soviet Russia after the Revolution practised experiments in communal child rearing, but they soon abandoned it. Th e function of child rearing is better performed today than in the past because now more skill and knowledge are devoted to the care of the unborn and newborn child. Th e infant death rate has shown a marked decline. In the achievement of this result, specialized agencies such as nursing and child welfare centres have come to the aid of the family. Looking at the data collected in the west it is seen that the number of illegitimate children is falling down, the practice of prostitution is vanishing away and the number of marriages is increasing, which clearly shows that the function of procreation of race is only performed through family.

 It is claimed that with the practice of birth control methods the function of child procreation is now being given up by modern families.

#### **Non-essential Functions**

**Economic:** Th e non-essential functions of a family are various and varied. First, it serves as *an economic unit.* In the traditional families, most of the goods for consumption were made at home. Th e members of the family were all engaged in the family industry. Th e ancient Hindu joint family served as a type of mutual insurance society. It was a unit of production and the centre of economic activities. Today, the importance of family as an economic unit has been lessened, as most of the goods for consumption, including food, are purchased ready-made from the market. Th e members of the modern family do not work together as they did in the past times. Th ey are engaged in diff erent activities outside the home. However, the old pattern has not been completely destroyed, it has merely changed. In the family, one or the other profession is still carried on though of a diff erent sort and in a diff erent atmosphere. Th ere is a clear division of labour between man and woman. Th e family members help in the economic adjustment of the family. Every family has its own economic capacity. Th e members purchase property—movable and immovable for the family. Property is an important economic institution that is protected and maintained by the family. Th e use and transmission of the property is usually prescribed by rules of the society. Th e equal distribution of property is an important function of the family.

**Religious:** Th e second non-essential function that the family performs is of a religious character. It is a centre for the religious training of the children who learn various religious virtues from their parents. In the traditional family, diff erent religious practices such as idol worship, yagya, religious discourses, and sermons by pandits were held, which made the outlook of the children religious. In the Hindu scriptures, religious rituals are considered incomplete in the absence of wife. Th e modern family, however, does not observe religious practices and has become secular in outlook.

**Educational:** Another function performed by a family is the education of children. Family is an important educational agency. Every child learns the fi rst letters under the guidance of parents. Th e traditional family was the centre of vocational education also because the children from the early childhood were associated with the family task. Th e modern family has delegated the task of vocational education to technical institutes and colleges.

**Health:** Th e functions related to health that were performed in the old family have now been transferred to hospitals and clinics. Formerly, a sick man was cared for in the family by his own kith and kin, but today he is admitted to a hospital and looked after by nurses. Th e child is born today not in the comforting fragrance of a home, but in the maternity wards of a well-equipped hospital. Instead of 'the house where I was born', the phrase 'the hospital where I was born' is more relevant to modern conditions.

**Recreation:** Th e old family provided recreation to its members. Th ey used to sing and dance together and visit the family relations. In modern family, relation is individual rather than collective. Th e present forms of recreation such as bridge, tennis, carom, and movies provide for only individual or couple participation. Today, people prefer to go to a club or a hotel for recreation.

**Civic:** Family is the school of civic virtues. Th e child learns the fi rst lessons of citizenship in the family. Th e virtues of love, co-operation, toleration, sacrifi ce, obedience, and discipline are fi rst learnt by the child in the family. Th ese qualities enable him to grow into a good citizen. Th at is why family has been called the cradle of civic virtues.

**Social:** Family imparts the knowledge of social customs, mores, etc. to the younger generation. It exercises social control over its members, which helps in the maintenance of a well-organized society. Family is an important agency of social control. It is also the custodian of culture and serves as the natural and convenient channel of social continuity.

**Role of family in socialization:** We have already dealt with the process of socialization in a previous chapter. Herein, we merely propose to throw light on the peculiar role of the family in this process. Th e family, on account of its several characteristics, is of strategic importance in socialization.

**(i)** When the child is born into a family, he/she is a social blank, more plastic than he will ever be again. Th e process of socialization begins within the family. It prepares the ground work upon which the agencies coming afterwards build. It monopolizes the time and experiences of the child during his formative years.

**(ii)** Th e infl uence of the family upon the child is deeper and more abiding than that of other groups. Th e child drops his childhood playmates, changes his school, forgets the school fellows, but the parents retain their close contact with him through most of his early life.

**(iii)** Family is a primary group. Its members are imbued with 'we' feeling, which is a helpful agent in transmitting the family attitudes and sentiments.

**(iv)** No other single group satisfi es the needs of the child as much as the family does. No group can compete with the family in that respect.

**(v)** In a family, there are both kinds of relationships, the authoritarian and the .equalitarian. Each type of relationship supplies a unique and necessary element in socialization. Th e child learns to be a man, a husband, and a father mainly through having lived in a family headed by a man, a husband, and a father.

**(vi)** A child continues to identify himself with the family forever. It is the only group that is always there in the life of man.

Th us, on account of its strategic position, the family, more than any other group, exerts a persistent, intimate, and far-reaching infl uence on the habits, attitudes, and social experiences of the child. It plays the foremost role in the formation of personality. It occupies a key place in social organization.

# **THE MODERN FAMILY**

Th e family system in most parts of the world has been mainly patriarchal in which the father or any other elder male member dominates the family. Th e renaissance and reformation ushered in the new age of technology and democracy, which began to undermine the foundations of the patriarchal family. On the one hand, there were economic factors involving industrialism, urbanism, and mobility which broke down the self-suffi ciency of the patriarchal family. On the other hand, there were cultural factors, the growth of democratic ideals, and the decline of religious orthodoxy, which were in less harmony with the prerogatives and attitudes of the patriarchal family. Th ese factors combined to challenge the patriarchal family and gave birth to what is called the 'modern family'.

# **Causes of the Decay of Patriarchal Family**

Th e following factors were responsible for undermining the foundations of patriarchal family.

**(i) Economic factors:** Th e Industrial Revolution substituted the power machine for the manual tool. As new techniques of production advanced, they shelved the old family of its economic functions. New factories with heavy machines were set up, which took both the work and the workers out of the family. Now, cloth was produced not on the family handlooms, but in the textile mills. Th ousands of workers were required to work in the factories. Not only males but females also began to go to the factory for work. Th e work of women became specialized like that of men and instead of being busy with the multifarious tasks of the family they went to workshops and factories for work. Women and daughters became as good earning members of the household as the men and sons. Th is earning power of women made them feel independent.

 Th e technological discovery aff ected the patriarchal family in other ways too. It not only drew out larger numbers of women into workshops and substituted ready-made commodities for homemade commodities but also introduced labour-saving devices in the performance of family tasks. Various appliances were used in cooking, baking, washing, and rearing up of the children that saved much energy and time of the housewife. She could now engage herself more on essential functions.

**(ii) Cultural factors:** Th e emergence of democratic institutions in political fi eld undermined the domination of the patriarch over the family members. Th e right to vote, which was given to a man by virtue of his being a property holder, became gradually, an individual right. Th e religious functions of the family diminished. Th e view that family was a divine creation and that the patriarch was the symbol of God in the family became less accepted. Th e choice of the mate was no longer made by parents, but by the individual himself. Woman attained a new political and legal status and a high degree of economic independence. Marriage was no·longer a devotion of woman to man, but contracting to live together on equal terms.

All this sounded the death knell for the patriarchal family and brought into existence the modern family, which is very much diff erent in structure and function from the traditional family.

Presenting a contrast between patriarchal family and modern family, E. W. Burgess and H. J. Locke wrote: 'Th e patriarchal family is authoritarian and autocratic with power vested in the head of the family and with the subordination of his wife, sons, and their wives and children and his unmarried daughter to his authority. Th e modern family is democratic, based on equality between husband and wife, with consensus in making decision and with increasing participation by children as they grow older. Marriage is arranged by parents in the patriarchal family with emphasis upon social and economic status,

and upon adjustment of the son-in-law or daughter-in-law to the family group. In the modern family, marriage is in the hands of young people and selection is made on the basis of romance, aff ection and personality adjustment to each other. Compliance with duty and the following of tradition are guiding principles of the patriarchal family. Th e achievement of personal happiness and desire for innovation are watch words of the modern family. Th e chief historical functions of the family, i.e., economic, educational, recreational, health, productive and religious are found in the fullest development in the extended patriarchal family. Th ese historic functions have departed from the modern family'.

# **Features of Modern Family**

**(i) Decreased control of the marriage contract:** Marriage is the basis of family. In traditional family, the marriage was contracted by the parents. Th e marriage ceremony was based on the principle of male dominance and female obedience. In modern family, people are less subject to the parental control concerning whom and when they shall marry. Th e marriage is now settled by the partners themselves. It is choice of mate by mate usually preceded by courtship.

**(ii) Changes in the relationship of man and woman:** In modern family, the woman is not the devotee of man, but an equal partner in life with equal rights. A husband now does not dictate, but only requests the wife to do a task for him. She is now emancipated of the man's slavery. She is no longer the drudge and slave of olden days. She can divorce her husband as the husband can divorce her. She can sue the husband for her rights and likewise be sued.

**(iii) Laxity in sex relationships:** Th e rigidity traditionally associated with sexual relationships no longer characterizes the modern family, cases of illegitimate sex relationship of the husband and wife too can be seen in modern family.

**(iv) Economic independence:** Women in modern family have attained an increasing degree of economic independence. It is not only the husband who leaves the home for work, the wife also goes out for work. Th e percentage of women employed outside the home is continually on the increase. In India, the number of women going out for employment is steadily increasing. In upper classes, women are property owners and in lower classes they are wage earners or professional workers. Th is economic independence has largely aff ected the attitude of modern woman. Formerly, she had no choice but to fi nd a male partner who could marry her and support her economically. She now does not feel helpless before man, but settles matters with him in terms of her own. She is not a slave of the man who provides her with food, clothing, and shelter; she can now earn her own living. Such a feature did not mark the traditional family. According to MacIver and Page, 'Not only the economic and the religious changes but the whole process of modern civilisation within which they fall has worked towards giving woman a new position in society and specially in relation to man'. In short, woman in the modern family has come as near achieving equality with men and children emancipation from parents.

**(v) Smaller family:** Th e modern family is generally a nuclear family. It is no longer a joint family. Moreover, the tendency is to have a smaller family, and the contraceptives help in checking the birth.

**(vi) Decline of religious control:** Th e modern family is secular in attitude. Th e religious rites of the traditional family such as early prayer, yagya, etc. are no longer performed in modern family. Marriage also has become a civil contract rather than a religious sacrament. It can be broken at any hour. Th e authority of religion over the conditions of marriage and divorce has markedly declined. Divorce is a frequent occurrence in modern family. In traditional family, it was a rare phenomenon.

**(vii) Separation of non-essential functions:** Th e modern family has given up a great many functions that were performed by the traditional family. Th ese functions have now been taken over by specialized agencies. Th us, the hospital off ers room for the birth of child, crèches and kindergartens look after the child and his education in the initial years. Many of the traditional tasks of the household such as cooking and baking, cleaning and washing are also performed outside the household by specialized agencies. Th e process advances still further as more and more families rely upon prepared and manufactured goods consumed by the family.

**(viii) Filocentric family:** Th e modern trend is towards the fi locentric family. A fi locentric family is one wherein the children tend to dominate the scene and their wishes determine the policy of the family. In modern family, use of physical punishment is·rare. Th e children now decide which school they will study in, what clothes they will wear, what food will be cooked, and which movie they will go to enjoy.

Th us, the family has been subjected to profound modifi cations of an economic, social, and biological nature. Th e modern family is no longer the economic and self-suffi cient unit. Th e women are no longer subordinated to the male dominance and are no longer confi ned to the drudgery of incessant toil in addition to the continual bearing of children. Th e use of contraception has reduced the number of children born during marriage. Ceremony and religion have lost almost all connection with the home as an entity. Th e individuation of family members has reached a point beyond which it cannot go. Th e size and functions of the family have been reduced. It has suff ered a change in regard to both its structure and functions. It now consists of the married couple and two or three children. Even this smallest family unit has shown a tendency towards instability. Its functions have been taken over by several specialized agencies. Th e functions of the present day family tend to revolve around personality. Burgess referred to the modern family as 'a unity of interacting personality'. Th e modern family is more individualized and democratic where women enjoy a high prestige and position. From an institution, it has moved towards companionship.

#### **Instability of Modern Family**

Th e striking problem that confronts the modern family is its instability. Th e traditional family was a stable type of family whose dissolution was rarely thought of and was not very easy. It faced the world as a unit. Women outside the family had no refuge. Th e profession of the family was fi xed, which was continued by succeeding generations. Social mobility was slight. But today it has all changed. Th e control of the family over its members has decreased. Th e younger generation does not like any interference by their elders. Th ere is lack of unity among the family members. Faith in one another is decreasing. Th e problems of working women have hindered the development of the children and led to increased confl icts between husband and wife. Th ere is lack of mutual trust. Th e marriage bonds have weakened. Th e ancient ideal of fi delity in sex-relationship has been adversely aff ected. Premarital and extramarital relationships have increased. Th ere is sexual disharmony between husband and wife. Th ere is no longer any family craft or profession. Th e members of the same family are engaged in diff erent pursuits; one in service, the other in business, a third in politics. Th e increase of specialized agencies has· greatly diminished common participation, which was the backbone of the traditional family. Members of the modern family take more interest outside the family. Th ey take meals in hotels and pass their nights in clubs and return home for a very short period. To women, marriage is not the only career open. Th ey work in factories and offi ces and earn an independent living. Th e modern family has shrunk both structurally and functionally and is gradually

losing its primary character. Th e state has undertaken to provide prenatal attention and infant schools, expensive medical facilities are available, the factory and offi ce provide the place of work, and clubs and bars are provided for recreation. If people fi nd their education, their work, and their recreation outside the family, and if women can get jobs which make them independent, surely the chance of a broken home can be laid at the door of a modern family. In many developed countries divorce rate has increased markedly. Th e United States holds the leading position in the number of divorces granted; the divorce rate being more than one divorce for every fi ve marriages. In India, although the divorce rate is not so alarming, the infl uence of individualism and the impact of western culture have adversely aff ected the stability of Indian family system. It may also be noted that the divorce rates provide only a very indirect measure of family instability because they do not include cases of broken families which have not secured divorce for one reason or the other. If we take into account also the domestic discords, desertion, and separation without being followed by divorce, it will be revealed that family instability is on the increase.

#### **Future of the Family**

From the above discussion, it is thus clear that there has been a great change in the functions of the family. It is no longer a home for recreation of its members, a school of education for children, or a centre for their religious training. Many family duties that were discharged formerly by the parents have now been transferred to external agencies. Cooking, washing, and caring for the children are hardly performed in numerous homes of the West and also in some of the East. A number of external agencies such as maternity hospitals, baby clinics, crèches, baby sitters, hotels, clubs, and cinemas have taken over the functions once performed in the family. Th e functions of a modern family are much limited.

Even the task of procreation has suff ered a setback. Of course, the task of satisfaction of sex need is better performed without any fear of pregnancy by modern family. In short, the family has lost some of its former functions. It is to be, however, remembered that though there is a loss of functions, the family is not going to perish. Th e task of procreation of children, the most essential social function, is only performed through the family. Th is function is incapable of being shifted to any other institution—without a radical change in society. If marriage is not for the purpose of having children, there would be no purpose in having it at all, because companionship and sexual gratifi cation can be had without the formalities of wedlock. More people are being married than ever before. In addition, more women are having children.

Th e family satisfi es not only the physiological needs of the male and female but it also satisfi es their psychological needs, the desire to love and to be loved. Mutual aff ection among family members provides solace against many of the mental diffi culties of a complicated society. Despite its structural and functional changes the family still plays a signifi cant role in social strength and social solidarity. It is the foundation of all social life. It is an inseparable part of man's nature. Burgess and Locke write, 'It seems safe to predict that the family will survive, both because of its long history of adaptability to changing conditions and because of the importance of its functions of aff ection giving and receiving in personal satisfaction and in personality development'.

#### **KINSHIP**

Man does not live alone in society. From birth till death he is surrounded by a number of people. Some of these people are his relatives, some are friends, some are neighbours and others are strangers and unknown to him. He is bound to all the people who are related to him either on the basis of blood or marriage. Th e relations based on blood or marriage may be close or distant. Th e bond of blood or marriage that binds people together in group is called kinship.

#### **Type of Kinship**

- (i) Affi nal kinship
- (ii) Consanguineous kinship

**(i) Affi nal Kinship:** Th e bond of marriage is called affi nal kinship. Marriage establishes a relation not only between a man and a woman but also brings together two families. Th us, a host of relations are created as soon as a marriage takes place. For example, after marriage a man becomes not only a husband, but also a brother-in-law and a son-in-law. Likewise, a girl after marriage becomes not only a wife but also a daughter-in-law. Th us, marriage creates a host of relationships which are called affi nal.

**(ii) Consanguineous Kinship:** Th e bond of blood is called consanguineous kinship. Th e consanguineous kin are related through blood, whereas the affi nal kin are related through marriage. Th e bond between parents and their children and that between siblings is consanguineous kinship. Siblings, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle, nephew, and cousin are consanguineous kin, that is, related through blood. In this connection, it may be pointed out that blood relationships may be actual as well as supposed. Among polyandrous tribes the actual father of a child is unknown. An adopted child is treated as if it were one's own biologically produced child. Th us, blood relationship may be established not only on biological basis but also on the basis of social recognition.

#### **Degree of Kinship**

On the basis of nearness or distance, relatives can be classifi ed in several categories. Some relations are very close, direct, and near.; for example, father, mother, sister, brother, husband, wife are our primary kin.

Secondary kin are related through primary kin. Th ey are not our primary kin, but are the primary kin of our primary kin; hence, our secondary kin. For example, father's father, mother's brother, father's brother (chacha), sister's husband (bahnoi) are secondary kin. Father is one's primary kin and his brother is the primary kin of father. Th erefore, father's brother is one's secondary kin. Similarly, sister is one's primary kin, but her husband is one's secondary kin.

Tertiary kins are the secondary kin of our primary kin or primary kin of our secondary kin. Th us, the wife of brother-in-law (sala) called sarhaj in Hindi is tertiary kin because brother-in law is one's secondary kin and his wife is the primary kin of brother-in-law. Similarly, the brother-in-law of one's brother is one's tertiary kin because the brother is one's primary kin and his brother-in-law is his secondary kin.

## **Kinship Usages**

Th e study of kinship system also includes the study of behaviour patterns of diff erent kins. Every relationship involves a particular type of behaviour. Th e behaviour of a son towards his father is one of respect, whereas the behaviour of husband towards wife is one of love. Th e behaviour of a brother towards his sister is one of aff ection. Th ere are some usages that regulate the behaviour of diff erent kin. Th ese usages are called kinship usages. Some of these usages are the following:

**(i) Avoidance:** In all societies the usage of avoidance is observed in one form or another. It means that the two kins, normally of opposite sex, should avoid each·other to maintain certain amount of modesty. Th us, a father-in-law (sasur) should avoid daughter-in-law. Th e purdah system in Hindu family illustrates the usage of avoidance.

**(ii) Joking relationship:** It is the reverse of avoidance relationship. Th e usage of this relationship permits an individual to tease or make fun of the other. Th e relationship between devar-bhabhi, jija-sali is a joking relationship.

**(iii) Teknonymy:** Th e word 'teknonymy' has been taken from the Greek word and was used in anthropology for the fi rst time by Taylor. According to this usage, a kin is not referred to directly, but he is referred to through another kin. A kin becomes the medium of reference between two kins. Th us, in traditional Hindu family wife does not utter the name of her husband. He is referred to by her as the father of so and so.

Kinship usages accomplish two major tasks. First, they create groups (special groupings of kin). Th e second major function of kinship usage is to govern the role of relationships among the kin, that is, how one kinsman should behave in a particular kinsman's presence, or what one kinsman owes to another. Kinship assigns guidelines for interactions between persons. It defi nes proper, acceptable relationship between father and daughter, between brother and sister, between son-in-law and mother-in-law, and among fellow lineage members and clansmen. Kinship, thus, acts as a regulator of social life and maintains the solidarity of social system.
