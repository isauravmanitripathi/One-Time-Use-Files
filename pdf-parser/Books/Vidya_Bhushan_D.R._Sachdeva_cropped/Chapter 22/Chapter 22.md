#### DEFINITION OF SCHEDULED CASTES/SCHEDULED TRIBES

The term 'scheduled caste' appeared for the first time in the Government of India Act, 1935. In April 1936, the British Government issued the Government of India (Scheduled Castes) order, 1936, specifying certain castes, races, and tribes as scheduled castes (SCs)/scheduled tribes (STs).

Under Article 341 of the Constitution, certain backward classes/communities suffering from untouchability and social disabilities were declared as SCs. So, generally speaking, the term 'scheduled castes' refers to the 'untouchable castes'. After the Constitution came into force, the list of SCs was notified under the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) order, 1950 by the President of India. Any amendment to the existing list of SCs/STs is made by a Parliamentary enactment. On the part of the Government, no definition of an SC or an ST has ever been given. Only at the pleasure of authorities, a community becomes an SC or an ST. No wonder, a community having some socio-culturaleconomic characteristics is an SC or an ST in one state, but not in another.

The SCs and the STs constitute 15.74 per cent and 7.85 per cent, respectively, that is, one-fourth of the total population of the country. About 52 per cent of all SC workers are agricultural labourers and 28 per cent are small and marginal farmers and share croppers.

Although there are have-nots and downtrodden among other sections of the populace, the major chunk of the deprived section of India's population that is living in abject poverty, abnormal ignorance, and unparalleled superstition comes from the SC. Among the deprived people too, it were the harijans who for centuries lived practically the life of servitude, humiliation, and utter helplessness.

#### **Problems of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes**

As described under 'Caste System' (Chapter 21), the Varna system of the Vedic period, in course of time degenerated into the caste system and shudras came to be called 'untouchables' who were called harijans by Mahatma Gandhi. Later, the Government of India Act, 1935, issued an order in 1936 specifying certain castes as SCs. Th e people of these castes were denied any political, civil, or economic rights and suff ered from various social, religious, educational, legal, and other disabilities. Briefl y stated, such disabilities were the following:

**(i) Lower status in the social hierarchy:** Th e society in ancient India was divided into four classes—Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra. Th e shudras were assigned the menial functions of sweeping and scavenging and were ascribed the lowest status. Th ey were considered unholy, inferior, and low; hence, untouchables. Th ey did not mix with the other classes and were kept physically and socially at a distance from the higher castes.

**(ii) Education disabilities:** Th e untouchables were not allowed to study Vedas or Sanskrit language considered to be the language of gods. Th ey were quite illiterate and ignorant. Th e schools were closed for them.

**(iii) Civic disabilities:** For a long time, the untouchables were denied the facility to use village wells, ponds, temples, hostels, hospitals, dharmshalas, rest houses, etc. Th ey lived on the outskirts of the towns and villages and led a life of utter poverty—half naked and half starved. Th eir places of abode were dirty, fi lthy, and dark.

**(iv) Religious disabilities:** Th ey were not allowed to enter temples. Th e Brahmans did not perform their religious ceremonies. Th e Vedic mantras could not be listened to and chanted by them.

**(v) Selection of occupation limited:** Th e caste system imposes restrictions on choice of occupation. Th e untouchables could not take the occupations reserved for the higher castes. Th ey were assigned inferior occupations such as removing the human wastes, sweeping, scavenging, tanning, shoemaking, carrying the dead animals, and curing hides.

**(vi) No property:** Th e untouchables did not own property. Th ey lead a pecuniary life and lived in dirty, dreary, and dark mud houses. Th ey worked as menials and had hardly anything to save.

**(vii) Landless labourers:** Majority of the SC members were landless labourers. Th ey worked in the fi elds as petty labourers. It has been estimated that agriculture in India employs about 70 per cent of the SC workers. Th ey were exploited by the upper caste people and the village moneylender. Even today, some of them continue to serve as bonded labourers in stone quarries and brick kilns.

**(viii) Political disabilities:** Th e untouchables did not enjoy any place in the politics or administration of the country in the centuries gone by. Under the British rule, they were given the right to vote for the fi rst time. However, in free India, they possess equal political rights and opportunities. Th ey are even provided with some special political and other privileges. Recently, they have become an important section of electoral politics and every political party tries to woo them.

Th e STs suff er from the following disabilities:

**(i) Geographic isolation:** Th e tribes of India generally live in hilly areas, deep valleys, and dense forests. Th ey are physically separated from the other parts of India and are deprived of the benefi ts of civilized world.

#### **242** Chapter 22

**(ii) Economic problems:** Th e tribal people are the poorest people. Th eir mode of life is primitive. Most of them live in debts. Th e tribal economy is mainly agriculture, which is highly uneconomic. Th ey are exploited by moneylenders, contractors, and businessmen. Young tribal women are often sold for money who are dumped in brothel houses. Th ere are no industries in tribal areas.

**(iii) Cultural problems:** Th e tribal people are staunch followers of their customs and traditions, practices and beliefs, attitudes and principles. Th ey are suspicious people and do not allow the entry of an outsider. Th eir marriage rules are very strict. Any violation is harshly punished. In independent India, eff orts are made to bring them to the main stream of Indian culture. Education facilities are being provided. However, the cultural gap between the tribals and non-tribals is very wide creating hindrance, in the way of their assimilation.

**(iv) Social problems:** Th e tribal people are superstitious, traditional, and custom bound. Th ey are the victims of outmoded beliefs, irrational practices, and harmful habits. Child marriages, infanticide, homicide, animal sacrifi ce, exchange of wives, black magic, and other harmful practices are still prevalent. Th ey believe in ghosts and spirits.

**(v) Educational and health problems:** Th e majority of tribal people are illiterate. Th ey have no faith in formal education. Th ey have no concept of education. Th ey are far removed from the fruits of modern civilization.

Th ey are also not very health conscious. Th ey have no concept of sanitation. Th ey believe that diseases are caused by hostile spirits and ghosts. Naturally, they do not visit a doctor for treatment, but go to a magician or use their own traditional means of cure.

### **CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS**

Th e Constitution prescribes protection and safeguards for the SCs and the STs and other weaker sections either especially or by way of insisting on their general rights as citizens, with the object of promoting their educational and economic interests and/or removing the social disabilities. Th e main safeguards are as follows:

**(i)** Th e abolition of untouchability and the forbidding of its practice in any form (Article 17).

**(ii)** Th e promotion of their educational and economic interests and their protection from social injustice and all forms of exploitation (Article 46).

**(iii)** Th e throwing open of the Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus [Article 25' (b)].

**(iv)** Th e removal of any disability, liability, restriction, or condition with regard to access to shops, public restaurants, hotels, and places of public entertainment or the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads, and places of public resort maintained wholly or partially out of state funds or dedicated to the use of the general public [Article 15 (2)].

**(v)** Th e curtailment by law in the interest of any Scheduled Tribes of the general rights of all citizens to move freely, settle in, and acquire property [Article 19 (5)].

**(vi)** Th e forbidding or any denial of admission to educational institutions maintained by the state or receiving grant out of state funds [Article 29 (2)].

**(vii)** Permitting the state to make reservation for the backward classes in public services in case of inadequate representations and requiring the state to consider the claims of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the making of appointments to public services (Article 16 and 335).

**(viii)** Special representation in the Lok Sabha and the state Vidhan Sabhas to Scheduled Castes and tribes till 25 January 2010 (Article 330, 332, and 334).

**(ix)** Th e setting up of Tribes Advisory Councils and separate departments, in the states and the appointment of a special offi cer at the centre to promote their welfare and safeguard their interests (Article 164 and 338 and Fifth Schedule).

**(x)** Special provision for the administration and control of Scheduled Castes and Tribes areas (Article 244 and Fifth and Sixth Schedules) .

**(xi)** Prohibition of traffi c in human beings and forced labour (Article 23).

#### **Representation in Legislatures**

Under Articles 330 and 332 of the Constitution, seats are reserved for the SCs and the STs in the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies in proportion to their population. Th e concession, initially for a period of 10 years from the commencement of the Constitution, has been extended through amendment up to 25 January 2010.

#### **Reservation in Services**

Article 335 of the Constitution provides that the claims of the members of SCs and STs shall be taken into consideration, in making appointments to posts and services, in connection with the aff airs of the Union or the states. Article 16 (4) permits reservations in favour of citizens of backward classes, who may not be adequately represented in services. In pursuance of these provisions, the Government has made reservation for the SCs and the STs in the services under their control. Reservation for the SCs and the STs (including vacancies carried forward) is subject to the sealing of 50 per cent of the total number of vacancies. Th is scheme of reservations is also being followed by the public sector undertakings. Th e voluntary agencies, which are in receipt of substantial grants-in-aid from the Government, are also required, as a condition, to adopt certain specifi c features of the reservation scheme in their establishments. Th e government was examining the feasibility of directing the private sector undertakings to reserve seats for SC/ST.

#### **Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes**

Th e commission was set up in 1978 under the Article 338 of the Constitution. It was renamed as National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in 1987. Its functions are as follows:

**(i)** To study the extent and ramifi cations of untouchability and social discrimination arising there from and eff ectiveness of the present measures and recommend further measures to be taken.

**(ii)** To study socio-economic and other relevant circumstances leading to the commission of off ences against persons belonging to SCs and STs; and to recommend appropriate remedial measures to ensure prompt investigation of such off ences.

#### **Centrally Sponsored Schemes**

- **(i)** Post-matric scholarship for the SC and ST students.
- **(ii)** Pre-matric scholarship for the children of those engaged in unclean occupations.
- **(iii)** Book banks for the SC/ST students studying in medical and engineering colleges.
- **(iv)** Girls' hostels scheme for the SCs.
- **(v)** Coaching and allied scheme for the SCs and STs.
- **(vi)** Aid to voluntary organizations engaged in the welfare of SCs.

**(vii)** National overseas scholarships for enabling the candidates belonging to the SCs/STs to go abroad for higher education.

## **PROTECTION OF CIVIL RIGHTS ACT, 1955**

In pursuance of Section 15A of the Protection of Civil Rights (PCR) Act, Government of India provides matching assistance to the states for the strengthening of machinery for the eff ective enforcement of PCR Act and Liberation of Scavengers by converting dry latrines into water-borne latrines and rehabilitation of liberated scavengers in alternative occupations.

#### **Baba Sahib Ambedkar Birth Anniversary Celebrations**

On the birth anniversary celebrations of Dr B. R. Ambedkar, the great son of India, the chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution of India, the greatest champion of the cause of downtrodden, the messiah of the SCs and STs, on April 13 every year, Government of India and State Governments announce a number of programmes for the welfare of SCs and STs. Th e Government conferred the highest civil award of the country Bharat Ratna on Baba Saheb posthumously and put his portrait in the central hall of Parliament in recognition of his services in nation-building and upliftment of the downtrodden.

# **SCHEDULED TRIBES**

Th e term scheduled tribes has been used for the fi rst time in the Constitution only. Th e earlier expressions used in preindependence days were aboriginal tribes, backward tribes, etc. Th ere is no universal defi nition of a tribe acceptable to all social scientists. But the defi nition of a tribe given by late Dr D. N. Majumdar has maximum acceptance. He defi ned a tribe as a social group with territorial affi liation; endogamous; with no specialization of functions; ruled by tribal offi cers, hereditary or otherwise; united in language or dialect; recognizing social distance from other tribes or castes, but without any stigma attached in the case of a caste structure; following tribal traditions, beliefs, and customs; illiberal of naturalization of ideas from alien sources; above all, conscious of a homogeneity of ethnic and territorial integration. Tribal origin, primitive way of life, habitation in remote and less easily accessible areas, and general backwardness in all respects are the features common to the tribes in various states.

#### **Constitutional Provisions for Tribal Welfare**

Th e Constitution provides various safeguards for promotion and protection of the interests of the STs. Provisions contained in Articles 19, 46, 164, 244, 275, 330, 332, 334, 448, 339, 342, and the 5th and 6th Schedules of Constitution are relevant in this regard. Th e Government of India's responsibility in relation to the development of scheduled tribes and scheduled areas extends not only to the provision of funds (Article 275) for their development but also to evolving policies and programmes for their rapid and harmonious development in consultation with and co-operation of the state governments.

#### **20-Point Programme**

Th e importance attached to tribal development is also refl ected in the new 20-Point Economic Programme, 1986, which has special emphasis on the development of STs. Being the nodal ministry for overall policy, planning, and co-ordination of programmes for the development of STs, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is concerned with the following points relating to the tribals:

- **(a)** Point 11: Justice to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
- **(b)** Point 7 (3): Pay special attention to water supply for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

**(c)** Point 14 (3): Lay special emphasis on construction of houses for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

**(d)** Point 16 (2): Protect the traditional right of tribal population and local communities of access to fi rewood and forest produce.

Th e British Government in India was mainly concerned with the maintenance of law and order rather than with economic and social development in tribal areas. In Assam, the policy of exclusion was followed and no outsiders except missionaries with known antecedents were allowed to go there. Since independence, the chief programmes for the STs have been directed to raising their standard of living, developing agriculture and industry in tribal areas, and providing for their educational, social, and economic development.

#### **Essential Conditions for Scheme for Tribal Welfare**

Th e schemes for tribal welfare must fulfi l two essential conditions, namely, conformity to the social values and patterns of the life of the people for whom they are intended and the psychological receptivity and the ability of the tribal population to absorb them. Th eoretical perfection of a scheme or its suitability to the people in general must not be regarded as the criterion for tribal people; ignorance of the tribal social values and inability to appreciate them are responsible for the failure of many development schemes. Th e Th ird Five Year Plan also held that it would be an error to over administer them in the name of development unless the tribal people are enabled to the above-mentioned two essential conditions, namely, conformity to the social values and patterns of the life of the people for whom they are intended and the psychological receptivity and the ability of the tribal population to absorb them. In facilitating the development, the tribal people should also be enabled to develop along the lines of their own genius, with genuine respect and support for their own traditional arts and culture and without pressure or imposition from outside. In tribal areas, every eff ort should be made to train and build up a team of their own people to do the work of administration and development, the constant aim being to develop local personnel both as offi cial functionaries and as social workers.

#### **Tribal Development and Welfare Strategy**

Tribal development has from the beginning been based on a two-pronged policy, viz., (i) protection and promotion of their interests, through legal-administrative support and (ii) implementation of development schemes to raise their level of living. Th e tribal sub-plan concept evolved and implemented during the Fifth Five Year Plan period continues to be the main instrument for development of tribal people and tribal areas.

#### **Objectives of Tribal Development**

Th e major objectives in tribal development were (i) taking up family-oriented benefi ciary programmes through raising productivity levels of the benefi ciary families in the fi elds of agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, small industries, etc.; (ii) elimination of exploitation of tribals in the spheres of alienation of land, money lending, debt-bondage, forest, etc.; (iii) human resources development through education and training programmes; and (iv) infrastructure development.

Th e tribal sub-plan is funded through resources drawn from (i) state plans, (ii) special central assistance of the ministry of social justice and empowerment, (iii) central and centrally sponsored programmes, and (iv) institutional fi nance.

#### **Tribal Co-operative Marketing Federation**

In order to explore new markets, to improve the marketing of tribal produce, to eliminate intermediates and obtain better value for tribal produce to augment the income of tribal families, a tribal co-operative marketing development federation (TRIFED) was set up at the national level during 1987–88, and a sum of `2 crores was provided as share capital assistance to TRIFED.

#### **Impact of the Programme**

Despite the eff orts of the government and voluntary organizations for the development and welfare of the STs, it is alleged that the tribal people have experienced nothing but the backlash of development leading to disorganization as a community and destitution as individuals.

Th e fact of the matter, however, is that the condition of the SCs and the STs continues to be pathetic in spite of the numerous constitutional safeguards and exclusive programmes for their welfare. For millions of those belonging to the weaker sections with small land holdings, as also the landless, escape from the atrocities suff ered for centuries is still a distant dream. On the one hand, caste-based inequity is being accentuated despite claim to the contrary and, on the other hand, tribal regions all over the country are simmering with discontent. Technological advances, instead of helping them march towards a better tomorrow, are ravaging them with increased severity. Th e situation in tribal areas is particularly disturbing, as is evident from the demand for a separate Bodoland. Th e claims of the state, in utter disregard of their traditional rights and virtual forced displacement for making room for the so-called development projects, have made the tribals restive. Atrocities against the weaker sections have acquired a new economic dimension. With the consolidation of the vested interests, the task of ensuring an equal deal to the under privileged has now become more diffi cult.

Neither the ban on untouchability nor reservation of jobs has made the harijans lot any better. Th e indiff erence of the upper caste Hindus is more or less the same as was many decades earlier. Untouchability continues to be practised in one form or the other, particularly in the rural areas of the country where the non-SCs have not yet overcome the aversion for the SCs and continue to exploit them. In a few urban pockets also, especially in the states of Bihar, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu there have been instances of discrimination against the SCs. Th e SCs are not allowed to draw water from the taps/wells used by the upper caste Hindus and are prevented from entering the temples. Th ey are refused service at places commonly used by the upper caste Hindus and are served in separate containers or utensils. In some places, they are denied the services of washerman, barbers, etc. and are still compelled to pursue their age-old unclean occupations due to socio-economic reasons. Th e late harijan leader, Jagjivan Ram, had remarked that the untouchability off ences act, which provides for imprisonment and fi ne to those who practise discrimination, is mostly on paper, particularly in rural areas. In the words of B. N. Singh, former Assam governor, Dr B. R. Ambedkar fi xed the limit of reservation for 10 years in the hope that within this period untouchability would end and a new social order would emerge. But it did not end even 65 years after independence.

#### **Suggestions/Remedies for Improvement of Impasse**

It is thus clear that the objective of integrating the SCs into the main stream of society still remains a far cry. Th e penal provisions of the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 plays but a limited role in dealing with the problem of untouchability. A more concerted eff ort is, therefore, required to be made in this direction by all government agencies at various levels. Administration/offi cial machinery needs to shed its unusual prejudice in favour ·of the higher caste Hindus and to feel more responsible to and involved in the task of eradication of practice of untouchability. Above all, the building up of a strong public opinion against the evil of untouchability is essential. Th e following steps also need to be taken to combat this menace:

**(i)** In order to ensure that maximum number of off enders under the provision of the PCR Act are punished, it would be advisable for the states to consider introduction of incentive schemes for police offi cials and other government functionaries whose performance is considered laudable in matters of proper registration of cases, fl awless investigation, and resolute prosecution ending in conviction. Recording of good remarks in the Annual Confi dential Reports of the dedicated and conscientious workers could be such incentive.

**(ii)** Special drives/campaigns such as observance of fortnight and week for eradication of untouchability could also prove to be useful in this respect.

**(iii)** Th e practice of untouchability in convert or overt form in government departments or educational institutions needs to be dealt with fi rmness. In addition to departmental action, prompt and strict legal actions also need to be taken up against the off enders.

**(iv)** Since the urge to practice untouchability is too deep rooted, it is necessary to fi nd out ways and means of bringing about a change in the mental outlook and social attitudes of the people in general. To achieve this objective, Government will do well involving, besides the voluntary organizations, selected educational and research institutions for carrying out broad-based surveys to locate the areas where untouchability is being practised.

**(v)** Necessary changes also need to be introduced in the educational system by incorporating suitable reading material at the primary and middle school levels.

**(vi)** Adequate propaganda and publicity should also be organized through mass media, viz., radio, TV, press, and cinema and also through debates, seminars, symposia, prabhat-pheris, and padyatras.

#### **248** Chapter 22

**(vii)** Community feasts along with members of the SCs and intercaste marriages need to be further encouraged. Government may also consider taking suitable remedial action with regard to objectionable portions, if any, in scriptures, books, or other publications explicitly or implicitly advocating any kind of discrimination on grounds of caste.

**(viii)** An ironical situation arises when some of the developmental schemes aimed at ameliorating the SCs further segregate them from the rest of the population. For example, house-sites being provided to the SCs under various schemes are generally located away from the main village, which impedes their coming closer to people belonging to the other castes. Similarly, educational institutions and hostels that are being opened exclusively for SCs tend to keep them away from students belonging to other castes. It is desirable that the programmes, meant for economic advancement of the SCs be implemented in such a manner that they in the process, also ensure the absorption of the SCs into the main stream of society.

#### **OTHER BACKWARD CLASSES**

Th e term backward classes is used to include SCs, STs, and other backward classes (OBC's). Th ese sections of the community have laboured under distinct disadvantages in consequence of the rigid caste-ridden hierarchy that prevailed in the past in India's social structure. Th ey have suff ered from social and economic disabilities and have come to be known as backward classes. Whereas the SCs and STs are identifi ed as a result of the issue of revised lists under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes List Modifi cation Order, 1956, and the denotifi ed communities are defi ned under the Criminal Tribes Act, 1924, the precise defi nition of OBC's has eluded so far.

As regard the socially and educationally backward classes, now popularly called ABC's, the only special provision is under Article 340 of Part XIV of the Constitution regarding the appointment of a Commission by the President of India to investigate the condition of backward classes.

Th e President of India had accordingly appointed a Backward Classes Commission headed by Shri Kaka Saheb Kalelkar in January 1953 to determine the criteria for treating any sections of the people, other than the SCs and STs, as socially and educationally backward; and in accordance with the criteria thus determined, to prepare a list of such classes. Th e commission in its report submitted in March 1955 recommended that the basic criterion for identifi cation of the OBC's should be their low social position in the traditional caste hierarchy of the Hindu society and accordingly prepared a list of almost 2700 communities, and estimated that 930 of them would alone account for nearly one-third of the country's population. Th e commission also considered women, as a class to be backward. While placing the report of the commission before the Parliament in September 1956, the Government of India observed that if the bulk of the country's millions were to be regarded as coming within the category of backward classes, no useful purpose would be served by separate enumeration of such classes. Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru was of the view that it is basically wrong to lable any section of the people as backward, even if they were so, when 90 per cent of the people in the country were backward and poor. It is, therefore, clear that the classes to be specifi ed should be distinctly and palpably more backward socially and educationally than the general run of the population. Government also endorsed the view expressed by the chairman of the Commission that acceptance of caste as a criterion of backwardness was not a correct approach and that the remedies suggested on the basis of caste would be worse than the evil of backwardness itself. Th e report was rightly shelved by Pt. Nehru, as such an approach was bound to lead to compartmentalization of society.

#### **Mandal Commission**

It was left to the Janta Government to disturb the hornet's nest in 1978 by again raking up the issue by the appointment of Second Backward Classes Commission headed by Shree B. P. Mandal.

Th e recommendations of the Mandal Commission are summarized as follows:

**(i)** Twenty seven per cent of the posts in public services should be reserved for OBC's. Th ey do make 52 per cent of the total population, yet the reservation quota for them cannot exceed this limit. Th is is because according to the law, as interpreted by the Supreme Court of India, the total quantum of reservations under Articles 15 (4) and (16) of the Constitution should be below 50 per cent, and at present 22.5 per cent of the government jobs are already reserved for the SCs and STs on pro-rata basis of their share in the population.

**(ii)** Welfare programmes specially meant for OBC's should be fi nanced by the Government of India in the same manner and to the same extent already done in the case of SCs and STs.

**(iii)** Radical land reforms should be brought about in states to free small land holders from their heavy dependence on rich peasants for their subsistence.

**(iv)** OBC's should be encouraged and helped to set up small scale industries.

**(v)** Special educational schemes, with emphasis on vocational training should be started for OBC's. Th ey should also be given special coaching in technical and professional institutions to enable them to compete with the students from the open quota.

#### **Announcement for Implementation of the Report**

Th e National Front had promised in its poll manifesto to implement the Mandal Commission Report. But the ruling party leaders had aired confl icting views about it. While both Mr Devi Lal and Mr Chandra Shekhar favoured the idea of imparting an economic basis to reservation in educational institutions and government jobs, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav swore by the caste label alone. Prime Minister V. P. Singh announced all of a sudden the acceptance of the Mandal Report on 7 August 1990 in the Parliament without taking into confi dence even his own cabinet colleagues, for reasons of political expediency—to off set the political mileage that Mr Devi Lal could gain by convening the Kisan Sammelan at New Delhi on 9 August 1990, immediately after his dismissal from the offi ce of the deputy prime minister. Th e miscalculated move of Mr V. P. Singh had alienated his senior-most colleagues, provoked the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM) to denounce publicly this rash decision, antagonized the bureaucracy and upset his sympathetic constituents, academics, journalists, students, and lawyers who were openly demanding his resignation—Mr Vasant Sathe and Dr Karan Singh had vociferously charged that he had plunged the nation in a casteist carnage.

Th us, several plans and schemes are being formulated to improve the economic and social status of the backward classes. However, much is still left undone. Th eir economic and social problems are complicated as it is not only the question of their economic development but also the question of raising their social status. Th ey live a solitary and segregated life socially despised of a vast population. To change social attitudes is not an easy task. Th e policy of reservation and special fi nancial assistance has benefi ted only a fraction of them—the white collar strata among them. Th e larger majority still lives a life of deprivation and social aloofness. Th e reservation policy has created a stigma against them. Th e Dalit card carries a political price. To ameliorate the economic condition and social status

#### **250** Chapter 22

of the backward classes is an uphill task for which vast fi nances, better integrated plans, and conscientious implementation of development schemes are needed.

#### **Critique of Reservation Policy**

Reservation policy has its justifi cation for SCs and STs, and OBCs for the reason that they constitute the underprivileged who have been oppressed, suppressed, exploited, humiliated, and deprived of equality, liberty, and justice in various spheres of life. Th ey have suff ered numerous disabilities, and are, therefore, known as downtrodden and deprived classes of the society. Th e founder fathers of the Republic had therefore rightly devised reservation as a kind of escalator to be used in politics to catch up with others.

But it is doubtful whether the reservation policy has been able to achieve the desired objectives because its advantages are alleged to be outweighed by its disadvantages. It is criticized on the following grounds:

**(i)** Reservation has done more harm than good. Th ere has been a disastrous lowering of standards in the civil, medical, engineering, and technical services and in the educational institutions.

**(ii)** Reservation was to serve for 10 years. As the underprivileged classes were discriminated against in the earlier social and political orders, stultifying their springs of creativity, reservation was considered necessary to rejuvenate them. Clearly, 10-year period was too short and the Parliament routinely extended it decade after decade and it is still in use. It now looks that it has become a prominent feature of our polity. Th is has created bad blood and heart burning among others.

**(iii)** Reservation policy has been and is being used as vote bank politics. Both the BJP and· the Congress governments announce for reservations for these classes at the time of elections to augment their vote banks. Surprisingly, even the Jats, Rajputs, and Brahmans, who are known to belong to the upper classes in terms of their wealth and relationship to royal dynasties, and had perpetuated inhuman indignities on the dalits, have become claimants for reservation.

**(iv)** All the parties do not get any tangible benefi ts from reservation. It is only the elite among them who are enjoying the fruits of reservation. What is worse is the progeny of one or two time users who suff er from no social or educational disability having been brought up as children of the elite are now monopolizing the benefi ts of reservation, although they do not really need them. Th ey are edging out the really needy and deserving among the dalits.

**(v)** Reservation ignores merit when someone is denied admission to an institution or an appointment as the same has been given to a less meritorious dalit.

**(vi)** Reservation has not and will not end social discrimination.

 It will only perpetuate the vote bank politics. Politicians will not therefore accept its abolition, since reservation policies have become a permanent feature of our political scenario.

**(vii)** Th e reservation policy is availed of by one and all SCs and STs, despite the fact that there is hierarchy of castes and subcastes. Th e degree of social stigma greatly varies among them as in the case of chamars (shoemaking class) and bhangis (scavenging group). Th e same is true for the STs. Th e Meena tribe is far more advanced than many forest- and hill-dwelling tribes that are cut off from civilization. It was, therefore, unrealistic and unjust to give them the bulk reservation as SCs and STs. Th e result is that" lion's share of the reservation cake has been taken by the Chamars and Meenas, and a few crumbles have gone to the more disadvantaged among the SCs and STs. Logically, a few homogeneous groups should have been carved out from these broad categories.

**(viii)** Th e implementation of Mandal Commission Report by the then prime minister Mr V. P. Singh had dropped a bombshell that created deep cleavage and sharply divided our society. Th ere were demonstrations, riots, and violence resulting in huge losses of property and human lives. Some students had even committed self-immolation. Th ere seemed to be no justifi cation for the OBC's, because unlike the SCs they had not suff ered from the severe social disability of untouchability and were marginally handicapped educationally, which was being redressed by a scheme of scholarships and which would have been further fortifi ed.

Hopefully, the reservation for the economically backward class will not repeat the abnormal uprising by various sections of society, since the move has the support of all the political parties.

It has come to be realized that caste-based reservation needs to be dispensed, since it is felt that sectarian approach like reservation for disadvantaged sections for long period of time may stand in the way of social harmony and speedy economic development of the country. It is also being felt that reservation is a favour that weighs down the recipient and stigmatizes him for life. If we are serious about social justice, we should build a network of high-quality schools in the rural areas for dalits, OBCs, and economically poor children and provide them wholesome environment and a dedicated faculty, which gives them ample food for thought. Th e rest will follow. Th e quota system has injected a lethal poison in our society and fi lled hatred in the minds of the people, particularly the youth. If we take the human race development route seriously and invest in it liberally, reservation may not be needed. But it is doubtful whether our politicians will like reservation policies to be done away with, as reservation politics has become a permanent feature of our polity and is being pursued for the promotion of interests of political parties and the individual politicians. Mahatma Gandhi and Dr B. R. Ambedkar were the champions of the interests of the downtrodden and genuine messiahs. Th e country would be fortunate to be blessed with such selfl ess politicians instead of the self-seeking ones.
