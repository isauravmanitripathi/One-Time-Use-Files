# **10 Power and Political Institutions**

Among political institutions state is the most powerful institution. It regulates the social relationship of man and is the overall controlling institution of society. Th erefore, its study becomes important for a student of sociology.

# **MEANING OF THE STATE**

State has been defi ned variously by political thinkers. Some of the defi nitions are as follows:

**(i)** 'State is a people organised for law within a defi nite territory'. —*Wilson* 

**(ii)** 'State is a territorial society divided into government and subjects claiming within its allotted physical area a supremacy over all other institutions'. —*Laski* 

**(iii)** 'Th e marks of an independent state are that the community constituting it is permanently established for a political end, that it possesses a defi ned territory and that it is independent of external control'. —*Hall* 

**(iv)** 'Th e state as a concept of political science and public law, is a community of persons more or less numerous, permanently occupying a defi nite portion of territory, independent, or nearly so, of external control possessing an organised government to which the great body of inhabitants render habitual obedience'. —*Garner*

**(v)** 'State is an association which, acting through law as promulgated by a government endowed to this end with coercive power, maintains within a community territorially demarcated the universal external conditions of social order'. —*MacIver* 

**(vi)** 'State is an organisation which rules by means of a supreme government over a defi nite territory'. —*Ogburn*

From the above defi nitions we conclude that state consists of four elements, that is, population, territory, government, and sovereignty.

**Population:** Th ere can be no state without population. Of course, no absolute standard can be laid down regarding the number of people in a state. Modern states vary in size and population as widely as China and India on the one hand, and Monaco and San Marino on the other.

**Territory:** Just as without population there can be no state, so without a fi xed territory no state can exist. It marks it off from the other states and decides its area of authority. Nomadic people cannot be said to constitute a state, although they may have some form of political organization through common subjection to a chief.

**Government:** Government is the machinery through which the state functions. All the citizens of a state are not part of a government. It includes only those offi cials and departments who are elected, appointed, or employed to determine, interpret, and carry out the regulations of the state or its subdivisions.

**Sovereignty:** Sovereignty is the most distinguishing characteristic of the state. Indeed, it is its essential attribute. All the individuals and groups of individuals within the state have to submit to the will of the state. It is internally supreme and externally independent. To use the language of Laski, 'it is by the possession of sovereignty that the state is distinguished from all other forms of human associations'.

On the basis of the above four factors, state may be defi ned as an association of people inhabiting a territory and living under a sovereign government.

#### **Diff erence Between State and Society**

Th e following points of diff erence between state and society are worth remembering:

**(i)** In point of time, society is prior to the state. Th e people lived in society much before the state emerged.

**(ii)** State is organized, whereas society may be organized or unorganized. Th e primitive society was unorganized, but the state is always organized.

**(iii)** Society exercises authority largely through customs and persuasion. Th e state exercises authority through laws and coercion. Th e state alone can legitimately use force.

**(iv)** State is a territorial organization, whereas a society does not occupy any defi nite territory. A Society may extend to the whole world. It may be international like the Red Cross Society.

**(v)** Th e membership of the state is compulsory, but not so of the society. Man like Robinson Crusoe may, if he so likes, live outside the society.

It may also be noted that society is held together by the state and if it were not so held together, *it* would not exist.

#### **Functions of the State**

Th ere is incessant controversy about what the state should do. Political thinkers have from time to time advanced many theories to defi ne the sphere of state activity. On the one hand, there are thinkers like anarchists, communities, syndicalists who question the very existence of the state and advocate a stateless society. On the other hand, there are absolute thinkers like idealists who regard the state omnipotent and entrust to it every action pertaining to human life. In between these two extreme types of thinking, there are the individualists who hold that government is the best, which governs the least. Th us, there is no unanimity among the political thinkers *as* to what the state should do.

*Th e state is a limited agency.* MacIver has beautifully discussed the entire questions of the thereof state activity in Chapter5 of his book *Th e Modern State*. According to MacIver, *the very nature of the state sets a limitation on the functions of the state.* Th e state has limits to what it would do. Th e state, as stated above, though universal, is a limited agency. It is limited by the means at its disposal. It is limited by the customs of the community. It is limited by the fear of resistance. And it is limited by the existence of other associations in society whose function it cannot perform or undertake. MacIver says, 'It is needless and futile to concentrate in one agency all the activities of life. Certain tasks the instrument can perform, but badly and clumsily—we do not sharpen our pencils with an axe. Other tasks it cannot perform at all and when it is directed upon them it only ruins the material'.

Th us, there are functions that only the state can perform; there are others that it is wholly incapable of performing; and lastly there are functions for which it is well adapted.

**Maintenance of order:** Th e primary function of the maintenance of order in society is the type of function that the state alone can perform. Th e state is possessed of peculiar attributes which enable it to perform this function, it has the power of life and death over all associations no less than over persons because of its unabated right to make war and peace. It claims the right to settle political disputes by force. In so doing, it elevates political interests to complete supremacy over all other interests. It alone can make rules of universal application. 'It alone can establish rights and obligations which admit of no exceptions …. It alone can defi ne the areas and limits of subordinate powers. It alone can co-ordinate within one great social framework the various organisations of a society. Th e state in short, is the guarantor and the guardian of the public order'. Order is not for its own sake, but for the sake of protection and of conservation and development. It is justifi ed only to the extent to which it serves the needs of the community in conformity with and limited by the ideals of the community, particularly by the ideals of justice and liberty. For the maintenance of order, the state performs a number of subsidiary functions like that of regulating and co-ordinating the work of other associations, defi ning the rights and obligations of citizenship, establishing and controlling means of communication and transportation, etc., formulating specifi c rights and obligations of persons within the family, within the economic order and within other social relationships, maintaining armies and police and providing for justice.

**Conservation and development:** Considering the second type of functions, that is, functions for which the state is well adapted, MacIver includes in this category 'the conservation and development of human capacities as well as of economic resources'. Th e state is well adapted to regulate the exploitation of natural resources in the interest of the present and future generations of the entire community. If the exploitation of natural resources is left in the hands of private individuals, then they will seek their own gain at the cost of mankind, conservation of forests, fi sheries, and exploitation of mineral resources are functions that the state should undertake.

Th e conservation and development of human capacities are no less important than that of the natural resources. Th e state should provide for education, public parks, museums, playgrounds, and contribute to the development of science, and to the encouragement of art. Although other agencies can perform these tasks, but none so effi ciently and on so great a scale, and with such authority as can the state.

**Should not control public opinion:** Taking up the functions that the state should not undertake, MacIver says, 'Th e state should not seek to control public opinion, no matter what the opinion may be, provided there is no incitement to break its laws or defy its authority'.

**Should not interfere with custom and fashion:** Th e state should not interfere with the customs and fashion directly. MacIver states, 'People will follow eagerly the dictates of fashion proclaimed by some unknown coterie in Paris or London or New York. But were the state to decree changes in themselves so insignifi cant, it would be regarded as monstrous tyranny; it might even lead to revolution'.

**Should not create culture:** Th e state cannot create culture, because culture is the expression of the spirit of people or of an age. Art, literature, and music do not come directly within the purview of the state. 'In all these activities people or a civilization goes its own way'.

It may be emphasized that in recent times there has been a tendency towards the growth of state functions. Th e welfare state is now a popular ideal. Th ere is now hardly a phase of life in which the state does not participate either as a renderer of services, as an arbiter, or as a controller.

To conclude the sphere of state action is undoubtedly vast, still it is not omnicompetent. It should refrain from the futile or pernicious eff ort to do those things that it is unqualifi ed to do and gird itself more resolutely, more nobly to the fulfi llment of those functions that it is well qualifi ed to do.

#### **GOVERNMENT**

#### **Meaning of Government**

Sometimes, a confusion is made between the state and the government, and the two words are used interchangeably. Government is an instrument of the state through which it carries out its purposes. A state is a politically organized and geographically limited body of people that possesses the right to use force. All the citizens of a state are not part of a government. A government includes only those offi cials and persons who are appointed or elected to determine, interpret, and carry out the regulations of the state. Th us, it has three main organs the *legislative* to determine the laws of the state, the *executive* to carry out these laws, and the *judiciary* to interpret them. Th e sole purpose of a government is to act as the instrumentality of the state. Its powers and organization are defi ned by the basic law called 'constitution' of the country. Most states have now written constitutions. Th e Indian constitution is the ultimate basis for judging the legality of any law a legislative body enacts or any order an executive body issues. Th e Supreme Court of India has the fi nal power to determine whether laws or executive orders are made in pursuance of the constitution.

#### **Forms of Government**

Government may take several forms. In history, there have appeared many forms of governments. Aristotle had given a six-fold classifi cation of governments—three normal and three perverted forms of government. Th e three normal types of government are monarchy, rule by one person; aristocracy, rule by a few; and polity, rule by many. If these normal forms are perverted, monarchy becomes tyranny, aristocracy becomes oligarchy, and polity becomes democracy. Th us, Aristotle regarded democracy as the worst form of government, but he felt that the potential capacity of the citizens for sound collective judgement could assure the success of this form. After Aristotle, numerous classifi cations of governments have been proposed by political thinkers, but as pointed by Garner, 'Th ere seems to be no single principle, or criterion, juridicial or otherwise, upon which a satisfactory classifi cation of government can be made'.

Today, our attention is drawn towards two major forms: totalitarianism, in which the control is in the hands of one or a few persons and democracy, in which political power is diff used among the governed by the process of representation. Russia and China are the classic instances of totalitarian form of government. Under totalitarianism, usually, questioning of the ideas and practices of the ruler is not tolerated. Freedom of expression by the press or individual is denied. Obedience is the supreme law which is enforced by the use of police powers.

Democracy is founded upon the principle of popular sovereignty, that is, ultimate power resides in the citizens. An importable principle of democracy is that all the citizens have equal political privileges. Another foundational principle is that the rule of the majority shall prevail; this majority has to be expressed by the citizens either through direct voting or through their elected representatives. A third principle is that the citizens can vote the government out of offi ce if it loses their confi dence.

Democracy is based on two basic cultural values of equality and liberty. It has attained a marked popularity in the world, yet it is often criticized for certain defects. Th e fi rst of these is that the citizens do not fully exercise their rights nor accept their obligations. Voting is a paramount right of the citizens in a democracy, but the citizens do not fully and honestly discharge their obligation to vote. Th e percentage of the Indian citizens who fulfi l this obligation ranges between 40 and 45 per cent. Moreover, voting is on the basis of caste and extraneous considerations. Election campaigns instead of educating the voters become exercise in praising one's own side and condemning the other to the extreme. Voting is so quantitatively and qualitatively poor that the whole process of democratic government is jeopardized.

Another defect lies in leadership. Th e leaders in a democracy indulge in unscrupulous activities in order to come into power and carry out unethical practices to remain in power. As a consequence, democracy attracts only those people who are unscrupulous or have little knowledge for governmental careers. It is a serious defect of democracy that so much of it is in the hands of poorly qualifi ed persons in the art of government. Political leaders in democracy must be of the people and not of any class, peasantry or industrial, rural, or urban. Th ey should not be dominated by special interests.

#### **Political Parties**

Political parties have become necessary adjuncts of government in modern times. Th ey are the instruments whereby candidates are nominated and elected. Th e ultimate aim of a political party is to capture political power and keep control of the government.

Th e number of political parties in a state varies from one to many. England and the United States have two-party system. Th e advantage of this system is its capacity to present more clear-cut issues and fewer candidates instead of a multiplicity of positions on issues and a wide number of candidates. Th e losing party in this system serves as an eff ective opposition. France is an example of a state with multiple-party system. Under a multiple-party system, governments change rapidly. Th e voters are bewildered by a number of viewpoints and the multiplicity of candidates they must assess. One-party system does not allow any opposition or criticism of state policy. Th e party leaders enjoy monopoly of power, and it is diffi cult to remove them peaceably. India has a multiple-party system. Defections and counter-defections continue. Th e political parties in India are 'personality centred' rather than 'policy centred'. More than forty parties operate at the national and local levels. Th ere is frequent competition and factional confl icts within the parties. Sometimes, inner cliques or 'rings' develop.

**Voting:** Election or voting is a distinctive feature of a modern democratic polity. One of the main functions of political parties is to contest elections. Th eir fi rst function is to select suitable candidates for party ticket and assist such candidates to win the elections. Voting is the process of

electing representatives to a body representing the people. It is these elected representatives, who in a democracy, perform decision-making functions. For the successful working of any democracy, a healthy system of voting is a sine qua non. Th e right to vote is a basic right guaranteed by the fundamental law of the country. Universal adult suff rage is recognized to be the most democratic system of franchise. In India, every man and woman of 18 years of age is entitled to be enrolled as a voter.

**Voting behaviour:** Voting behaviour depends on several factors and diff ers from place to place. Generally speaking, educated and urban population is seen more involved in elections, whereas the illiterate and rural population shows its apathy. Some voters are committed to a particular party, whereas some take decision at the time of election. In India, voting behaviour has undergone tremendous changes. Since independence, the level of political awareness is constantly rising among all segments of population.

Political mobilization is taking place at a faster speed in rural areas. Th ere is only a minor diff erence in the turn-out rate between urban and rural areas.

Th e voting behaviour is aff ected by the following factors:

**(i) Religion:** India, since ancient days, has been predominantly a country inhabited by diff erent religions. Despite the fact that the constitution declares India to be a secular state, no political party including the Congress (I) has ever ignored it. Th e religious structure of a constituency is kept in mind while selecting the candidates or appealing for votes. During election campaigns, the religious sentiments are exploited to the maximum. Voters are attracted to the candidates belonging to their own religion. Th e Ayodhya issue has been exploited by all the political parties for the politics of votes.

**(ii) Caste:** Elections in India are contested very much on the basis of casteism. Th e voters are asked to vote for the candidate of their caste. Casteism is maintained by the elected leaders after the elections are over. Political parties sponsor only that candidate from a particular constituency whose caste is the most numerous in that area. In spite of their professions to the contrary, the Indian politicians including the political tacticians of the Congress and the CPI give a great deal of attention to caste considerations. 'While caste itself as a social institution is undergoing radical changes on account of the infl uence of western education and the development of urban life, it nevertheless, continues to play an important role in determining the choice of voters from among the various candidates.

**(iii) Community:** Community feeling is another factor infl uencing the voters. Community feelings had led the Telugu people to demand a separate state of Andhra; likewise, hilly people in Uttar Pradesh asked for Uttarakhand state. Th e voters of a particular community, say Punjabi, vote for their community candidates not because he is the best but because he belongs to their own community. Th e candidates also make appeals in the name of community, pointing out the injustices being suff ered by their community and take pledge to ameliorate their condition. All politicians have been exploiting community sentiments since the fi rst general elections in India.

**(iv) Class:** It is one of the factors infl uencing voting behaviour in the regions where the electorate is mostly composed of voters belonging to working class. In big industrial town like Mumbai, Ahmedabad, and Kanpur a trade union leader wins election on the basis of class considerations. Th e workers aspire that their leader should be elected to fi ght their cause in the legislature. A number of our legislators are persons who have at one time or other been in the forefront of Trade Union movement.

**(v) Money:** Money perhaps plays the greatest role during elections. Crores of rupees are spent by the political parties in their bid to capture political power. A lot of money is spent in election campaign and helicopters are hired to reach the voters in far fl ung constituencies. Big industrialists and business magnates contribute a lot of money for election funds. Votes are purchased through payment in cash or kind. As a majority of voters are poor people belonging to lower castes, they are easily swayed away by money.

**(vi) Charisma:** Th e personality of the party leader also infl uences the choice of voters. Th us, the Congress won several elections in the name of Nehru and Indira Gandhi.

**(vii) Accidental factors:** Sometimes, some accidental factors like excesses during Emergency or the murder of Rajiv Gandhi infl uences the voters.

To conclude, voters in India seldom vote after objective assessment of the comparative merits of various candidates or scientifi c analysis of the election manifestos; they are mostly infl uenced in their choice by non-rational factors like those of religion, caste, and community, etc.

# **PRESSURE GROUPS**

Pressure groups play a vital role in the process of government. A pressure group is generally an association of persons with a common economic interest who try to infl uence governmental action in legislation, administrative procedures, or judicial decisions. Th e Chamber of Commerce, the Trade Unions, the Scheduled Caste Federation, Kissan Sammelan are instances of pressure groups. Th ey come into being to make the government responsive to the interests of particular groups of citizens. In the Indian political system, pressure groups play conspicuous part in the political process as a whole. Th eir role in elections is conspicuous. At diff erent levels of electoral process in nomination, canvassing and campaigning these groups take cudgels on behalf of their favourites and get them a coveted place in the legislature and later in the cabinet. Th ey have a sizeable block of voters in their pockets and also contribute to the fi nancial sinews of the party concerned. Th e members elected with the support of a pressure group are compelled to do their biddings with far greater strength than the biddings of their party. Th e pressure groups make use of all their resources and persuasive forms to procure political decisions and administrative actions of their choice. Th ey also infl uence public opinion through mass media at their disposal. In a democracy, their role is greater than in a totalitarian government. Th e party in power in a totalitarian political system does not recognize the existence of such particularistic entities and even regards their emergence as anathema.

## **INSTITUTION OF POWER**

#### **Meaning of Power**

Kingsley Davis defi nes power as 'the determination of the behaviour of others in accordance with one's own ends'. According to Sheriff and Sheriff , 'Power denotes the relative weights of behaviour by member in a group structure'. Weber has defi ned power as 'the probability that one factor (individual or group) within a social relationship is in a position to carry out his own will despite resistance, regardless of the basis on which this probability rests'. He goes on to say, 'All conceivable qualities of a person and all conceivable combination of circumstances may put him in a position to impose his will in a given situation'. Th ese defi nitions show that power is a broad concept. In general, it means

the ability to get one's wishes carried out despite opposition, if any. As put by Green, 'Power is simply the extent of capability to control others so that they will do what they are wanted to do'. Lundberg and others also say, 'By power we mean the extent to which persons or groups can limit or regulate the alternative courses of action open to other persons or groups, with or without their consent'. Similarly, R. H. Tawney states that, "Power is the capacity of an individual or group of individuals, to modify the conduct of other individuals or groups in the manner which he desires'. According to MacIver, By the possession of power we mean the capacity to centralise, regulate or direct the behaviour of persons'.

From the legal point of view power has been classifi ed into (i) Legitimate and (ii) Illegitimate. Legitimate power may be of three kinds, that is, legal power, traditional power, and charismatic power. Legal power is the power given by the law and the constitution of the country; for example, the power of the army or the police. Th e sources of traditional powers are the customs and traditions of the society; for example, the power of the parents or the teachers. Th e source of charismatic power lies in some peculiar quality; for example, the power of religious 'guru' like Sai Baba over his followers. Illegitimate power is one not recognized by the society; for example, the power of dacoits.

#### **INSTITUTION OF AUTHORITY**

Th e concept of authority is closely linked with the concept of power. Authority means legitimate power. Hamuel Arendt portrays authority as power based on consent. Following are the defi nitions of authority:

**1.** 'Authority is often defi ned as power, the power to command obedience'. —*MacIver*

**2.** 'Authority is the power to make decisions which guide the actions of another. It is relationship between two individuals—one superior and the other subordinate'. —*Herbert A. Simon*

**3.** 'Legitimate power is often called authority'. —*Robert A*. *Dahl*

**4.** 'Authority is the capacity innate or acquired for exercising ascendancy over a group. It is manifestation of power and implies obedience to it'. —*Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences*

#### **Sources of Authority**

According to Max Weber, there are three sources of political authority, viz., traditional, charismatic, and legal.

**(a)** When a continuous use of political power or its exercise on the basis of customs and traditions leads to emergence of right to rule it is known as traditional authority.

**(b)** When the right to rule springs from the dynamism of a political leader, it is termed as charismatic authority. —*Tclweru*

**(c)** When the right to rule emerges from the constitutional rules, it is termed as legal rational authority.

It will not be out of place to point out that in ancient times, king and his advisors were the fountain of authority. In democracy, authority is hierarchical. Th e offi cial on the top of hierarchy enjoys the maximum authority. According to Peter Oadjupar, 'Power structure or systems are usually hierarchical in form with those at the top normally bearing more power than those at the lower level, since decisions made and enjoyed at the top of the pyramid have more widespread eff ect than those made further down'.

#### **The Limits of Authority**

Authority is always subject to limits. If the limit is violated by those who possess authority, the subordinate can ignore or oppose it. In the words of Marriam, 'Leader or the man in authority is like the bus driver. He is allowed to use his discretion in the selection of the road, but he must take his passengers in the desired direction and if he does not they leave him on the way and choose their own path'.

**Authority vs. power:** Power and authority are considered synonymous, but in actual fact both diff er. In the words of Lasswell, 'Power becomes authority when it is legalized. Capacity to issue orders is power, whereas authority is exhibited at a point where decisions are taken. Th e main points of diff erence are as follows:

**(a)** Authority is always legitimate, whereas power is both legitimate and illegitimate.

**(b)** Authority is based on consent, whereas power is based on force. According to Eric Row 'Power like authority is a means of favourably aff ecting the behaviour of another, but by might not right'.

**(c)** By nature, authority is more democratic than power, as it is always legitimate and based on popular support.

**(d)** Authority refl ects the ability of man to get his proposals accepted, but power is the capacity of man to change the behaviour of others.

Despite these minor diff erences the concepts of power and authority are most vital and inseparable elements of politics. Th ey have become central to the study of politics.

### **BUREAUCRACY**

#### **Meaning of Bureaucracy**

Th e growth of bureaucracy is a major social trend of modern society. It is found in both public and private organizations. Literally, the term bureaucracy means administration by bureaus. Bureau is an administrative unit. Some of the defi nitions of bureaucracy are as follows:

**(i)** According to Max Weber, 'Bureaucracy is a system of administration characterised by expertness, impartiality and the absence of humanity'.

**(ii)** According to Willoughby, 'Bureaucracy is any personnel system where the employees are classifi ed in a system of administration composed of a hierarchy of sections, divisions, bureaus, departments and the like'.

A bureaucracy is a pyramid of offi cials who conduct rationally the work of an organization. Max Weber has given the following characteristics of bureaucracy:

**(a)** A hierarchical principle in all bureaucratic organizations.

**(b)** A reliance on written documents, fi le records, and the other apparatus of modern offi ce management.

**(c)** Th e formulation of general rules or practices for the management of the offi ce.

Th ompson gave the following characteristics of bureaucracy:

**(a) Specialization:** Specialization means that each task is assigned to an expert.

**(b) Merit appointment:** Th e appointments are made on merit basis without any personal favour.

**(c) Job Tenure:** Th e offi cer holds offi ce for a fi xed tenure.

**(d) Formalistic impersonality:** A set of formal rules and procedures are followed to ensure impartiality.

**(e) A chain of command:** Th ere is a hierarchy of command. Each lower offi ce is under the control and supervision of a higher one.

To sum up, a bureaucracy has the following features:

- **(i)** Diff erentiation of functions.
- **(ii)** Technical Specialization.
- **(iii)** Hierarchical organization and discipline.
- **(iv)** Objectivity of method.
- **(v)** Adherence to rules.
- **(vi)** Maintenance of fi les and records.
- **(vii)** Appointment and not election of staff .
- **(viii)** Fixed salary scales.
- **(ix)** Separation of the offi cial from the ownership of the means of production or administration.
- **(x)** Political neutrality.

#### **Social Consequences of Bureaucracy**

Max Weber called bureaucratic administration the most rational type of administration. It has brought in some good consequences, which are as follows:

- **(i)** It lays stress on technical knowledge.
- **(ii)** It is dominated by the principle of appointment.
- **(iii)** It is subject to strict discipline.
- **(iv)** Specialization of functions increases administrative effi ciency.
- **(v)** Th ere are well laid out rules, which are uniformly applied without any favour.
- **(vi)** A bureaucratic administration is objective oriented.
- **(vii)** Th ere is impartiality and objectivity in administration.

#### **Criticism or Bureaucracy**

Bureaucracy has largely succeeded in reaching the objectives for which it was established, yet it is still subject to criticism. It has led to some evil social consequences, which are as follows:

**(i) Depersonalization:** Bureaucracy is looked upon with ridicule. Civil servants are contemptuously called 'bureaucrats'. Th e procedure becomes more important than results. Everything goes 'through proper channel'. Th ere is no human touch anywhere. It is easy for a bureaucrat to defend himself by citing the regulations and his duties as a public offi cial. Th e depersonalized character of bureaucratic administration tends to create ill will and resentment.

**(ii) Formalism:** Another great defect of bureaucracy is its excessive adherence to formalism. Th ere are set rules and printed forms. Th e language and the forms of offi cial letters, the method of making note, sending it upwards or downwards all are fi xed beforehand. Each offi cer acts mechanically. All this kills the sense of judgement and initiative of the offi cial.

**(iii) Red tape:** Red tapism is a great vice of bureaucratic administration. Th ere is blind attachment to rules, which in some cases are outdated and old. Th e bureaucrats consider the forms of business more important than its substance. Th e bureaucrats have a mania for regulations and formal procedure. Th ey are indiff erent towards the convenience of the citizens.

**(iv) Infl exibility:** Bureaucracy is generally infl exible in its attitude. It keeps on following its old procedures and does not react to the changing social and political climate of the country. Routine procedures breed infl exibility. Th e offi cial becomes oriented towards techniques rather than people.

**(v) Division of responsibility:** It is another irritating aspect of bureaucracy. No offi cial can take a decision without consulting several offi cers at diff erent levels of hierarchy. Th e citizen is incapable to fi nd the person whom he can pin down for a decision. He goes from table to table and gets lost in the circumlocution offi ce.

**(vi) Creation of a new social class:** Bureaucracy has created a new social class that consists of white-collar workers. Th ey assume an excessive sense of self-importance. Th ey remain aloof from the common man and are indiff erent to his feeling or convenience. Th ey have their separate clubs and mode of life. Ramsay Muir was very critical of the growth of the power of bureaucracy. A bureaucrat becomes a soulless automation. He develops an authoritative attitude.

In short, bureaucracy has produced numerous social consequences. Professor W. A. Robson has summarized the defects of bureaucracy in these words, 'Th e maladies from which bureaucracy most frequently suff ers are an excessive sense of self-importance on the part of offi cials or an undue idea of the importance of their offi ce and indiff erence towards the feeling or the convenience of the individual citizen; an obsession with the binding and infl exible authority of departmental decisions, precedents, arrangement or forms, regardless of how kindly or with what justice they may work in individual cases, a mania for regulations and formal procedure, a preoccupation with the activities of particular units of administration and an inability to consider the government as a whole, a failure to recognise the relation between the governors and the governed as an essential part of democratic process'.

In India, the bureaucratic machinery has grown in size, but not in quality. It has become politicized and corrupt. Th ere is a close nexus between the politician, bureaucrat, and criminal. But this only emphasizes the need for the rational organization of bureaucracy. Th e system should be so built

as to avoid unnecessary delay, red-tapism, and formalism and to create among the functionaries a sense of participation in and identifi cation with it. Checks should be devised that bureaucracy functions like true servants of the people.
