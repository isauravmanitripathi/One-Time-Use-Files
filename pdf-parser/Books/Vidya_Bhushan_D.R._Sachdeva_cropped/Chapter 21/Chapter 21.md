# **21 Caste System**

## **MEANING OF CASTE**

As said earlier, in India class has assumed a peculiar form in caste. Th e word 'caste' owes its origin to the Spanish world *casta* which means 'breed, race, strain, or a complex of hereditary qualities'.

Th e following defi nitions of the word 'caste' have been given:

**(i)** 'When a class is somewhat strictly hereditary, we may call it a caste.' —*H. Cooley*

**(ii)** 'When status is wholly predetermined, so that men are born to their lot without any hope of changing it, then class takes the extreme form of caste'. —*MacIver*

**(iii)** 'Caste is a system of stratifi cation in which mobility, up and down the status ladder, at least ideally may not occur'. —*Green*

**(iv)** 'Caste is a system in which an individual's rank and its accompanying rights and obligations is ascribed on the basis of birth into a particular group'. —*Williams*

#### **FEATURES OF CASTE**

According to Megasthenes, two elements of the caste system are the following: (i) there is no intermarriage and (ii) there can be no change of profession. Although the statement of Megasthenes draws attention to two important factors of the caste system, it does not give us a complete idea of the system. To give a complete idea of what a caste is, the following features may be described:

**(i) Segmental division of society:** Th e society is divided into various castes with a well-developed life of their own, the membership of which is determined by the consideration of birth.

 Th e status of a person does not depend on his wealth but on the traditional importance of the caste in which he had the fortune of being born. Caste is hereditary. No amount of wealth and no amount of penance or prayer can change his caste status. Th e status is determined not by vocation but by birth.

**(ii) Social and religious hierarchy:** Th e whole society is divided into distinct classes with a concept of high and low. Th us, Brahmins in India stand at the apex of the social ladder, while Sudras are at its bottom and are considered 'untouchable'.

**(iii) Restrictions on feeding and social intercourse:** Another element of caste is the complex of taboos by which the superior castes try to preserve their ceremonial purity. Th ere are restrictions on feeding and social intercourse, and minute rules are laid down with regard to the kind of food that can be acceptable by a person and from what castes. For example, a Brahmin will accept 'pakka' food (i.e., food prepared in ghee) from any community, but he can accept 'kachcha' food at the hands of no other caste.

 Even the wells are polluted if a low-caste man draws water from them. So rigid are the rules about defi lement that Brahmins will not perform even their ablutions within the precincts of a Sudra's habitation. Even a Brahmin doctor, when feeling the pulse of a Sudra, fi rst wraps up the patient's wrist with a small piece of silk so that he may not be defi led by touching the skin.

**(iv) Endogamy:** A person born in a caste remains in it for life and dies in it. Every caste is subdivided into subcastes, everyone of which forbids its members to marry persons outside it. Th us, each subcaste is endogamous. Th is principle of endogamy is so strict that one sociologist regards endogamy as 'the essence of the caste system'.

**(v) Lack of unrestricted choice of occupation:** Members of a particular caste are expected to follow the caste occupation. Th ey cannot change to other occupation.

**(vi) Civil and religious disabilities:** Generally, the impure castes are made to live on the outskirts of the city. In southern India, certain parts of the town or village are inaccessible to certain castes. It is recorded that under the Marathas and the Peshwas, the Mahars and Mangs were not allowed within the gates of Poona between 3 pm and 9 am because before nine and after three their bodies cast too long a shadow, which falling on members of the higher caste defi les them. All over India the impure castes were not permitted to draw water from wells used by the members of other castes. Th e public schools did not admit impure castes such as Chamars and Mahars. Th e Sudras could not study the sacred literature.

#### **DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CASTE AND CLASS**

Th e fundamental points of diff erence between class and caste are the following:

**(i) Open versus closed:** Class is more open than caste. A person by his/her enterprise and initiative can change his/her class and thereby rise in the social status. If people are born in a labour class, it is not necessary for them to live in the class for life and die in it. Th ey can strive for money and success in life, and with wealth they can change their social status implied in the class distinction. In case of the caste system, it is impossible to change one's caste status. Once people are born in a caste, they remain in it for their lifetime and make their children suff er the same fate. A caste is thus a closed class. Th e individual's status is determined by the caste status of his/her parents, so that what an individual does has little bearing on his/her status. On the other hand, the membership of a class does not depend on the heredity basis; it rather depends on the worldly achievements of an individual. Th us, the class system is an open and fl exible system, while the caste system is a closed and rigid system.

**(ii) Divine versus secular:** Th e caste system is believed to have been divinely ordained. In the Bhagavad Gita, the Creator is said to have apportioned the duties and functions of the four castes. An individual must do the duty proper to his/her caste. Failure to act according to one's caste means rebirth in a lower caste and fi nally spiritual annihilation. People of lower castes are reborn in higher castes if they have fulfi lled their duties. Th e caste system in India would not have survived for so many centuries if the religious system had not made it sacred and inviolable. On the contrary, there is nothing sacred or of divine origin in the class stratifi cation of society. Classes are secular in origin. Th ey are not founded on religious dogmas.

**(iii) Endogamous:** Th e choice of mates in the caste system is generally endogamous. Members have to marry within their own castes. Th e members marrying outside their caste are treated as outcaste. No such restrictions exist in the class system. A wealthy man may marry a poor girl without being outcast. An educated girl may marry an uneducated man without being thrown out from the class of teachers.

**(iv) Class consciousness:** Th e feeling of class consciousness is necessary to constitute a class, but there is no need for any subjective consciousness in the members of caste.

**(v) Prestige:** Th e relative prestige of the diff erent castes is well established, but in the class system there is no rigidly fi xed order of prestige.

Recently, the Honourable Supreme Court while adjudging the constitutionality of job reservation for the other backward classes (OBCs), as provided under Article 16(4) of the Indian Constitution, by a majority opinion has upheld the criterion of caste as the determinant of a backward class. In its judgment, it has excluded all members of the so-called forward classes howsoever economically and educationally backward from the defi nition of backward classes. It has thus equated class with caste.

#### **ORIGIN OF THE CASTE SYSTEM**

Th e exact origins of the caste system cannot be traced. Th e system is said to have originated in India. Th e records of the Indo-Aryan culture contain the fi rst mention and a continuous history of the factors that make up caste. Th e people, who are known as Indo-Aryans, belong linguistically to the larger family of people designated either as Indo-Europeans or as Indo-Germans. Th ey comprised the Anglo-Saxons, the Celts, the Romans, the Spanish, the Portuguese, and the Iranians among others. One of the branches of these people who reached India in about 2500 BC is called Indo-Aryans.

**(i) Racial theory:** According to Dr. Mazumdar, the caste system took its birth after the arrival of Aryans in India. In order to maintain their separate existence, the Indo-Aryans used for certain groups of people the favourite word 'varna', 'colour'. Th us, they spoke of the 'Dasa varna', or more properly the Dasa people. Rigvedic literature stresses very signifi cantly the diff erences between the Arya and the Dasa, not only in their colour but also in their speech, religious practices, and physical features. Th e three classes—Brahma, Kshatra, and Vis—are frequently mentioned in the Rig Veda. Th e name of the fourth class, the 'Sudra', occurs only once in the Rig Veda. Th e fi rst two classes—Brahma and Kshatra—represented broadly the two professions of the poet-priest and

the warrior-chief. Vis comprised all the common people. Th e Sudra class represented domestic servants approximating very nearly to the position of slaves. On the relations subsisting between the four classes, the Rig Veda has little to say. However, the Brahmin is defi nitely said to be superior to the Kshatriya.

**(ii) Political theory:** According to this theory, the caste system is a clever device invented by the Brahmins in order to place themselves on the highest ladder of social hierarchy. Dr. Ghury states, 'Caste is a Brahminic child of Indo-Aryan culture cradled ill: the land of the Ganges and thence transferred to other parts of India'. Th e Brahmanic literature of the post-Vedic period mentions certain mixed classes (Sankara jati) and also a group of outcaste classes ( Antyavasayin). Among the four varnas, the old distinction of Arya and Sudra now appears as Dvija and Sudra. Th e fi rst three classes are called Dvija (twice born) because they have to go through the initiation ceremony which is symbolic of rebirth. Th e Sudra was called 'ekajati' (once born). Th e word 'jati' is henceforward employed to mean the numerous subdivisions of a 'varna'. However, this demarcation is not rigidly maintained. Th e word 'jati' is sometimes used for 'varna'. In the Brahmin period, the position of the Brahmins increased manifold. Th e three lower classes were ordered to live according to the teaching of the Brahmins who declared their duties, while the king was also exhorted to regulate his conduct accordingly. Th e pre-eminence of the Brahmins had secured them many social privileges sanctioned by the law givers. Th e statement that God created the Sudras to be the slave of all was repeated and they were given the name of 'padaja' (born from the feet).

 As the priestly infl uence grew in India, complicated rules of ritual and conduct were built up and incorporated into the religious books. Th e Brahmins closed their ranks and tried to maintain their superiority over the other classes. It is true that in the beginning there were no rigid restrictions, but slowly and gradually the idea of separation stiff ened. It was fi rst the ritual and ceremonial purity which as time went on took an exaggerated aspect. Distinction began to be made between things pure and impure. Restrictions were imposed on food and drink. When the Brahmins closed their ranks, it was natural that other classes should also follow suit.

**(iii) Occupational theory:** According to this theory, the origin of the caste system can be found in the nature and quality of social work performed by the various groups of people. Th ose professions which were regarded as better and respectable made the persons who performed them superior to those who were engaged in dirty professions. According to Nesfi eld, 'Function and function alone is responsible for the origin of caste structure in India'. With functional diff erentiation, occupational diff erentiation and numerous subcastes such as Lohar, Sonar, Chamar, Bhangi, Barhai, Patwa, Teli, Nai, Tamboli, Kahar, Gadaria, and Mali came into existence.

**(iv) Traditional theory:** According to this theory, the caste system is of divine origin. Th ere are some references in Vedic literature wherein it is said that castes were created by Brahma, the supreme creator, so that human beings may harmoniously perform the various social functions essential for the maintenance of society. According to Dr. Mazumdar, 'if, however we take the divine origin of the Varuas as an allegorical explanation of the functional divisions of society, the theory assumes practical signifi cance'.

**(v) Guild theory:** According to Denzil Ibbetson, castes are the modifi ed forms of guilds. In his opinion, the caste system is the product of interaction of three forces: (i) tribes, (ii) guilds, and (iii) religion. Th e tribes adopted certain fi xed professions and assumed the form of guilds. In ancient India, the priests enjoyed greater prestige. Th ey were a hereditary and endogamous group. Th e other guilds also adopted the same practices and in course of time became castes.

**(vi) Religious theory:** Hocart and Senart are the two main advocates of religious theory. According to Hocart, social stratifi cation originated on account of religious principles and customs. In ancient India religion had a prominent place. Th e king was considered the image of God. Th e priest and kings accorded diff erent positions to diff erent functional groups. Senart has tried to explain the origin of the caste system on the basis of prohibitions regarding sacramental food. He holds that on account of diff erent family duties there grew up certain prohibitions regarding sacramental food. Th e followers of one particular deity considered themselves the descendants of the same ancestor and off ered a particular kind of food as off ering to their deity. Th ose who believed in the same deity considered themselves as diff erent from those who believed in some other deity.

**(vii) Evolutionary theory:** According to this theory, the caste system did not come into existence all of a sudden or at a particular date. It is the result of a long process of social evolution. A number of factors played their part in the development of the present caste system. Among these factors, we may enumerate the following:

- **(i)** Hereditary occupations
- **(ii)** Th e desire of the Brahmins to keep themselves pure
- **(iii)** Th e lack of rigid unitary control of the state

**(iv)** Th e unwillingness of rulers to enforce a uniform standard of law and custom and their readiness to recognize the varying customs of diff erent groups as valid

- **(v)** Beliefs in reincarnation and the doctrine of karma
- **(vi)** Ideas of exclusive family, ancestor worship, and the sacramental meal
- **(vii)** Clash of antagonistic cultures particularly of the patriarchal and matriarchal systems
- **(viii)** Clash of races, colour prejudices, and conquest

**(ix)** Deliberate economic and administrative policies followed by the various conquerors particularly by the British

- **(x)** Geographical isolation of the Indian peninsula
- **(xi)** Static nature of Hindu society
- **(xii)** Foreign invasions
- **(xiii)** Rural, social structure

All the above factors conspired to encourage the formation of small groups based on petty distinctions from time to time. Th e lack of rigid unitary control of the state, the unwillingness of the rulers to enforce a uniform standard of law and custom, their readiness to recognize the varying customs of diff erent groups as valid, and their usual practice of allowing things somehow to adjust themselves led to the growth of groups and promoted the spirit of solidarity and community feeling in every group. Multiplicity of the groups and the thoroughness of the system are also due to the habit of the Hindu mind to create categories and to carry things to their logical end, a characteristic manifested in our literature, philosophy, and religious creeds.

It may, however, be noted that the caste system is not specifi cally an institution of the Hindus but is a typical Indian institution. Buddhism in its practice was at least not opposed to the caste system, and the two primary attributes of interdining and intermarriage between diff erent hereditary determined sets of people in the same community are also found among the Muslims of India. Further, the caste system is not a monopoly of India. It existed and still exists in many parts of the world. Th e feudal system of the medieval Europe was a species of the caste system. Certain ethnic groups such as Jews and Negroes are still treated as castes in many civilized countries including the United States. What is unique in the Hindu caste system is that it alone classifi ed some groups as untouchable and unapproachable.

#### **MERITS OF THE CASTE SYSTEM**

From time to time the Indian caste system has been attacked from various quarters, and it has been ascribed to all the numerous evils from which society is suff ering. But the very fact that it continues, in spite of these attacks as before, goes to prove that the system is not as bad as it is thought to be. Th e very fact that the Brahmins retained their supremacy for two thousand years proves that they were eminently fi tted to be in a position of domination.

Th e merits of the caste system are the following:

**(i) Trade union and orphanage:** It has provided a fi xed social environment to the members of the caste. One is provided with a permanent body of associations which control almost all of one's behaviour and contacts.

**(ii) Spirit of cooperation:** It has fostered the spirit of cooperation and fellow feeling among members of the same caste.

**(iii) Economic pursuits:** It defi nes the economic pursuits of the individual. Th ere is an occupation pertaining to every caste so that not only the child's future is carved out but also a proper place of apprenticeship is provided. Th ere is more pride in workmanship. Ancient India was a land provided with generations of craftsmen and soil cultivators who were extremely skilful in their avocations.

**(iv) Racial purity:** It has preserved the racial purity of the higher caste by forbidding indiscriminate intercaste marriages.

**(v) Infl uence on intellectual make-up:** It infl uences the intellectual make-up of an individual. Since the caste dictates to each member—customs to be observed in the manner of diet, the observance of ceremonies, and whether he may marry a widow—his views on the social and political matters are bound to be infl uenced by his caste customs.

**(vi) Integration of the country:** It develops class consciousness without breeding class struggle. It has created an effi cient organization of Hindu society without giving any chance to class frictions and factions. It integrated Indian society into one vast and variegated community and provided the country with a sure basis of security and continuity, whereby a stable and orderly organization of society could be possible.

**(vii) Various functions:** It provides for the various functions necessary to social life—functions ranging from education to scavenging, from government to domestic service of the most menial kinds—and it makes this provision under the sanction of a religious dogma, the belief in karma. It provides a much better method of division of labour than the European class system.

**(viii) Cultural diff usion:** It helps in cultural diff usion within the group. Th e caste customs, beliefs, skill, behaviour, and trade secrets are passed on from generation to generation. Culture is thus carried from one age to another.

**(ix) Separation of social from political life:** It has separated the social from political life and has maintained its independence from political infl uences.

# **DEMERITS OF THE CASTE SYSTEM**

Th e system has given rise to several evils:

**(i) Denial of mobility of labour:** It has denied mobility of labour since the individual must follow the caste occupation and cannot change it according to likes or dislikes. Th is leads to stagnation.

**(ii) Untouchability:** It leads to untouchability. Large section of people are reduced to the state of virtual slavery. In addition, it has created many other social evils such as child marriage, dowry system, and casteism.

**(iii) Retardation of solidarity:** It has retarded the growth of solidarity and brotherhood in the Hindu society by rigidly separating one class from another and denying any type of social intercourse between them. It bas led to the disintegration of Hindu society and weakened it.

**(iv) Wrong occupation:** It often results in putting individuals on wrong occupation. Th ere is no guarantee that a priest's son would also able to be a priest or would possess the qualities for a successful priest. Under the caste system, one cannot take up any other profession even though one may possess the skill and liking for that. It does not fully utilize the talents and capabilities of the population and is, therefore, a barrier to optimum productivity.

**(v) Obstacle to national unity:** It has proved an obstacle to the growth of national unity in the country. Th e lower classes feel discontented at the behaviour meted out to them in society. As Dr. G. S. Ghurye states, 'It is the spirit of caste-patriotism which engenders opposition to other castes and creates an unhealthy atmosphere for the growth of national consciousness'.

**(vi) Obstacle to social progress:** It is a great obstacle to the social and economic progress of the nation. Since the people believe in the theory of 'karma', they become conservative. And because their economic position is fi xed, they are led to inertia, killing their initiative and enterprise.

**(vii) Undemocratic:** Th e caste system is undemocratic because it denies equal rights to all irrespective of their caste, creed, or colour.

**(viii) Promotion of casteism:** Th e caste system has created the feeling of casteism. Under the infl uence of casteism, members of one caste do not hesitate in harming the interests of members of other castes. Th e politicians exploit the feeling of casteism to their advantage at the cost of nation's interests.

On the perusal of comparative merits and demerits of the caste system, it may be concluded that the demerits far outweigh the merits. Although the caste system played an important role at a certain stage of Indian history by supplying the social foundation to the village community system, it has lost its utility in modern India. It is on account of the closed character of the Indian caste system that the people of India are lowly motivated and the society as a whole is inert and

apathetic. As James Bryce says, 'Social structure is an important factor. Where men are divided by religion, or caste distinctions grounded on race or on occupation, there are grounds for mutual distrust and animosity which make it hard for them to act together or for each section to recognise equal rights in the other'. Until the caste barriers are broken and it becomes possible for a person of low status to profi t by individual eff ort, such eff ort will not be forthcoming and the society will ultimately suff er.

## **INTERDEPENDENCE OF CASTES (JAJMANI SYSTEM)**

Th e caste system, as seen above, is a peculiar feature of the Indian society. It has a stronger hold in the rural areas than in the cities. Caste provides rules of social behaviour which cannot be violated. Each caste under the caste system tries to maintain its hold over its members and controls their behaviour. Th e traditions, customs, and rules of behaviour diff er from caste to caste. Although the diff erent castes are socially segregated, there arise several social occasions when one caste has to secure the services of the other castes. Such dependence among the castes has been called vertical unity by Sri Nivas. It has also been given the name of jajmani system under which each group within a village is expected to give certain standardized services to the other castes. Th e more important castes who render services to other castes are the following:

**(i) Brahmins:** Th e primary function of the Brahmin caste is to perform various religious and ceremonial rituals. At the birth of a child, the Brahmin is called to note the time of birth and prepare the horoscope of the child. He also fi xes the day and time for 'mundan' ceremony. At the time of marriage, the Brahmin performs the marriage rituals and cites ''mantras'. At the time of death, he is called to perform the last ceremonies. If he fi nds some ill omens, he also tells the methods to get rid of the evil days in future. In return for his services, the Brahmin gets payment in both cash and kind. Generally, the landlords do not pay cash but pay a part of the crops during harvest. Th e Brahmin continues to perform his traditional services even today for all the castes.

**(ii) Kumhars:** Th e 'Kumhars' or potters make earthen pots. In the villages, the people use earthen pots to store the grain and for other domestic purposes. Th ese pots are supplied by the potters. Th ey also supply 'kulhars' and other earthen pots at the time of birth, marriage, and death. Th ey get either cash or grain in return for the pots supplied by them. Th ey are given food during marriage period. Sometimes they get clothes also.

**(iii) Nai:** Th e 'Nai' or barber is an important person for several social and religious functions. At the time of birth, marriage, or death, he cuts the hair of the family members of his 'jajman'. He also carries marriage or death message to the relatives. Sometimes, he acts as a mediator for negotiating a marriage. In return for his services, he gets clothes and a part of the crops.

**(iv) Dhobi:** Th e 'Dhobi' or washerman washes the clothes of his 'jajman'. In return for his services, he gets a part of the grains. On special occasions like marriage or birth, he also gets clothes or utensils.

**(v) Barhi and Lohar:** Th e carpenter and the blacksmith make or repair the traditional agricultural implements of the farmers. Th ey also do other works such as making doors and windows. Th ey get fi xed rates of payment for diff erent services. Th e services of these classes are needed by all the castes in the village.

**(vi) Darji:** Th e 'Darji' or tailor stitches new clothes or mends the old ones. His services are also required by all the castes in the village. Generally, the village tailor mends the old clothes free, while he charges fi xed rates for stitching the new ones. From some families, he gets a part of the crops during harvest.

**(vii) Chamar:** Th e 'Chamar' generally carries the work of shoemaking and shoe repair. Th eir services are required on other occasions also. Th ey do the menial work like sweeping the animal sheds and looking after the animals. Th ey also remove carcasses. Th ey also work as agricultural labourers. Th ey receive payment in the form of food, grain, or cash. For removal of the carcasses, they get the skin of the animal as payment.

**(viii) Gaderia:** Th e 'Gaderia' or shepherds are the herdsmen who keep sheep, goats, cows, and buff aloes. Th ey sell milk and get cash payment. After harvesting, they take their animals to the fi elds. Th ey also cultivate the land.

**(ix) Bhangi:** Th e 'Bhangi' or sweepers do the sanitary work. In villages there are no fl ush or ever-clean latrines. Th e sweepers remove the night soil from the houses and throw them away from the village. On ceremonial occasions, their services are particularly important for which they are paid in both cash and kind. Th ey work as agricultural labourers for which they get a part of the crops at the time of harvest. Th ey also get old clothes from their jajmans.

**(x) Bania:** Th e 'Bania' generally sells the things of daily necessities on cash or credit basis to the villagers. He also lends money to the farmers and other castes. Th e rate of interest is generally compound. Such loans are usually given to purchase bullocks and agricultural implements or meet marriage expenses. Th e agriculturists mortgage their land to the moneylender.

From the above brief description of the 'jajmani' system, we may deduce the following features:

**(i) Permanent:** Th e jajmani rights are permanent. A 'jajman' or patron cannot remove his ' rarjan' (servant) at his will. His diffi culty will not be in dismissing him, but in fi nding a substitute.

**(ii) Hereditary:** Th e jajmani rights are property rights and hence are inherited according to the law of inheritance.

**(iii) Barter system:** Th e exchange of services is not based on the money system but on the barter system. Th e serving family gets things in exchange for the services rendered by it; though in some cases it may also get money. As a matter of fact, the relationship between the 'jajman' and the 'parjan' is not one of the employer and the servant. Th e jajman looks after the all needs of his parjan and helps him whenever it is so required.

Th e 'jajmani' system is advantageous as (i) it provides security of occupation, the occupation being hereditary; (ii) it provides economic security as the jajman looks after all the needs of the serving family; and (iii) it reinforces the relations between the jajman and his parjan which are more personal than economic.

But the jajmani system once useful in the Indian society has gradually been reduced into exploitation of the lower castes. Th e higher castes exploit the lower caste people who fi nd themselves helpless before the money power of their patrons. Th e jajmani system suff ers from all evils of the caste system. Due to the impact of urbanization and the growth of rapid means of transport, the jajmani system is getting disintegrated; yet it may not be denied that the functional interdependence of castes is a marked feature of the Indian caste system in the villages.

## **CASTE SYSTEM IN CONTEMPORARY INDIA**

While discussing the features of the caste system, we had the occasion to remark that the caste system is a rigid system, but it is not possible to maintain an absolute caste system. Social change requires social adaptation.

In India, rigidity was never maintained. In modem times, this rigid element of the caste system has undergone changes and one can confi dently say that rigid distinctions are watering down. Th e various factors that have brought about changes in the caste system may be described as follows:

**(i) Infl uence of reformist movements:** Th e fi rst important factor nibbling at the root of the caste system was the spread of western education. Th e British brought a casteless culture and literature full of thoughts on individual liberty with them to India. Th e Indians who studied this literature could be impressed with the progressive ideas of English writers. Swami Vivekanand observed, 'Th e caste system is opposed to religion or the Vedantas'. All our great preachers have tried to break it down. From Buddhism onwards every sect has preached against castes. Reformers such as Raja Ram Mohan Roy and Devendranath Tagore started movements aiming at the brotherhood wherein humans shall not be divided from humans on account of caste. Swami Dayanand preached for the substitution of four old divisions of the Hindu society in place of the present manifold ramifi cations and started an association, 'Arya Samaj', for reviving the ancient purity of the Vedic society. Th e chief centre of Arya Samaj was in Punjab. Th e Th eosophical movement also worked for the abolition of the caste system, particularly since 1893 when Annie Besant became the president of the society. Another reform movement was the nationalist movement which launched mass campaigns under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation, who made the problem of the removal of untouchability a national one. His name will always be remembered in the history of its abolition.

**(ii) Legislation during British rule:** Apart from the attacks of Indian reformers, the Britishers, when they occupied the country, tried to impose the western type of culture, and in doing so they came into direct confl ict with the established caste system in this country. By the establishment of British courts and administering a uniform criminal law, they removed from the hands of the caste panchayats, many matters that used to be erstwhile adjudicated by them. After it the British administrators tackled civil matters. In 1856, the Widow Remarriage Act was passed which contained clauses practically violating the customs of the lower castes.

 Th e Caste Disabilities Removal Act of 1850 facilitates conversion to another religion or admission into another caste without aff ecting the property rights of the person. Th e British administrators took a further step for removing some of the civil disabilities of the untouchables. Th ey recognized the rights of untouchables to be properly educated, and to be given all social, economic, and political benefi ts. In 1925 in Chennai, all public wells and schools were thrown open to all the classes including the depressed. Government scholarships and concessions in fees were awarded to the students of the depressed classes. Under the Montague-Chelmsford scheme, social representation was extended to depressed classes.

**(iii) Impact of industrial revolution:** Industrial revolution has also been a factor responsible for transforming the Hindu social structure. Th e Caste system in India is to a very large extent related to village industries and handicrafts. Th e decay of village handicrafts and hereditary occupations, which is the inevitable result of industrialization, aff ects the social structure in a number of ways. Th e old occupations having disappeared, new occupations have appeared wherein the Brahmin and the Sudra freely meet and mix. Th ere is much more freedom of choice of occupation today than under the old regime. At present many members of the Brahmin caste are seen engaged in almost any of the occupations excepting, of course, of sweeper and scavenger. Many members of the various artisan castes are shopkeepers, bank clerks, and teachers. Whatever restrictions caste imposed on the choice of occupation have now ceased to exist and guide the individuals. Industrialization leads to urbanization of population. Th e village people are forced to put aside their orthodox ideas and have to eat food prepared by non-caste fellows. With the spread of communication, personal contacts have multiplied which have changed the attitudes which separated caste from caste. Th e place of caste panchayats has been taken over by trade unions, law courts, and other such bodies. Th e trade union includes all the workers, to whatever caste they belong, as members. Caste restrictions cannot be enforced in a factory where members from the lower class rub their shoulders with the members of the higher class. Th e caste associations have been replaced by occupational associations such as teacher's associations, civil services associations, and a host of traders and services associations where people of diff erent castes mix freely and plan their strategy for pursuit of common ends.

**(iv) Attack by Indian constitution:** Th e most systematic and severe attack on the caste system has been made by the Constitution of India. Its very preamble solemnly asserts that the people of India have constituted themselves into a sovereign, secular, democratic, republic, which is named 'India, that is, Bharat'. Th e aim is to secure to all its citizens justice, social, economic, and political; liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship; equality of status and opportunity, and to promote among them all fraternity ensuring the dignity of the individual. Equality guaranteed is not only of opportunity, but also of status.

In guaranteeing the right of equality, Section 15 of the Indian Constitution reads:

**(1)** Th e state shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of them.

**(2)** No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of them, be subject to any disability, liability, restriction, or condition with regard to (a) access to shops, public restaurants, hotels, and places of public entertainment; (b) the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads, and places of public resort maintained wholly or partly out of state funds or dedicated to the use of the general public.

Article 16 guarantees equality of appointment to any offi ce under the state irrespective of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence, or any of them. Article 17 has abolished untouchability, and its practice in any form is thereby forbidden. Th e right of freedom under Article 19 guarantees, among other things, that of practice of any lawful calling without restriction.

Besides the above provisions, the constitution includes various provisions to improve the social condition of the depressed classes. Article 46 reads, 'Th e state shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and, in particular, of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation'.

Article 330 provides reservation of seats in the House of People for the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. Under Article 332, seats are to be reserved for them in the legislative assembly of every state. Th e number of seats thus reserved will bear the same proportion to the total number of seats in the assembly as the population of the scheduled castes in the state bears to the total population of the state concerned. Article 338 makes provision for the appointment of a special offi cer for the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes whose duty will be to promote their welfare and safeguard

their interests. Articles 16 and 335 permit the state to make reservation for the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and other backward classes in public services.

Th e government has also started various schemes for the upliftment of scheduled castes and s cheduled tribes. Among such schemes the notable ones are the setting up of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (which has since been bifurcated into two separate commissions one each for scheduled caste and scheduled tribes with eff ect from 23 February 2004, since the problems of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes are diff erent), pre-matric scholarships for children of the scavenging class, post-matric scholarships scheme to provide fi nancial assistance to the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe students to enable them to pursue post-matriculate education, Book Bank Scheme for scheduled caste/tribe students studying in medical and engineering colleges, Girls Hostel Scheme for scheduled castes, Coaching and Guidance Scheme for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes for successfully competing in competitive examinations held by various recruiting agencies including the UPSC. Th e Scheduled Castes Development Corporations have been set up in the states to provide an interface between scheduled castes families and fi nancial institutions in respect of bankable scheme of economic development. Central aid is provided on 100 per cent basis to the voluntary organizations who are engaged in the welfare of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.

Th us, the Constitution of India and the various programmes in pursuance of the constitutional provisions have sought to abolish the caste system and improve the social and economic conditions of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.

Th e provision of reservation of seats for other backward classes (OBCs) in educational institutions and public services is the latest step taken for the welfare of the 'dalit' classes.

#### **Future of the Caste System in India**

From the above brief discussion of the various measures that have been taken in India, it may be said that though the infl uence of the caste system is slowly decreasing in the Indian society, it continues as before and there is very little change in the attitude and mentality of the people. Th e caste system is a part of Hindu religious order and enjoys the sanction of scriptures. Th e village, the heart of Hindu social organization, is the seat of caste at its strongest. Th e endogamous nature of caste has remained almost the same with this diff erence; whereas formerly marriage outside the caste was not even thought of, today many young men and women are prepared to break through the caste if love marriage demands it. In such marriages the female partner belongs to a caste lower than that of the male partner. Th e older generation, however, still thinks in old caste terms. Th e elections in India are contested very much on the basis of casteism. Th e voters are asked to vote for their caste candidates, and thus casteism is maintained by the elected leaders after the elections are over. Political parties also sponsor only that candidate from a particular constituency whose caste is the most numerous in that area. Casteism still persists in government services. Seats are reserved for backward and scheduled castes in government services as well as in the legislatures. Th ey are given special scholarships for education. In the name of minority their separate identity is maintained. Th us, the Indian democracy has in practice encouraged rather than discouraged the caste system. G. S. Ghurye is right when he says that there is no fear of the extinction of the caste system in the near future. 'Th e diff erence between the old regime and contemporary society', as Ghurye states, 'lies in this that whereas under the ancient organisation the facts mentioned above were almost universally true, today there is a section of society—the modern educated persons small yet important, which has risen above all these restrictions'. Attitudes of exclusiveness and distrust between castes still exist. Th e recent atrocities on Harijans by landed aristocracy in Bihar and other places point to our failure to solve the problem of casteism. Sh. B. N. Singh, former Assam Governor observed, 'Dr. B. R. Ambedkar fi xed the limit of reservation for 10 years in the hope that within this period untouchability would end and a new social order would emerge. But it did not end'. We are still trying to solve the problem and fi xing another limit. Th e judgement of the Supreme Court in the Mandal case has ensured a fresh lease of life to the cancer of casteism for a long and indefi nite future. Th e judgement would revitalize casteism, divide the nation into two—forward and backward—and open up new vistas for internecine confl icts and disintegrating and divisive forces, and make backwardness a vested interest. It will probably undo whatever has been achieved since independence towards creating a unifi ed and integrated nation. It has replanted the poisonous weed of casteism. It is doubtful if our political leaders thriving on casteism will ever shed their caste character.

What is now needed is to educate public opinion, denounce caste patriotism in unequivocal terms, and give to Hindu religion a new doctrinal basis in consonance with the values of liberty and fraternity. Th e enthusiasm of youth will surely denounce Hindu fundamentalism and transcend the artifi cial barriers of caste. With the spread of education, political reforms, and the amelioration of economic position, it is hoped that Indian people will rise to the occasion and throw off the caste system.
