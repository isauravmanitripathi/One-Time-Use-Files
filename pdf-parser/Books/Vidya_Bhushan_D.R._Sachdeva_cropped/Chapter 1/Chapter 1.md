# Unit 1 Fundamentals of Sociology

## **1 Sociology: Defi nition, Scope, Nature and Signifi cance**

Th e term *sociology* was coined by Auguste Comte, a French philosopher, in 1839. Th e teaching of sociology as a separate discipline started in 1876 in the United States, in 1889 in France, in 1907 in Great Britain, after World War I in Poland and India, in 1925 in Egypt and Mexico and in 1947 in Sweden.

Sociology is the youngest of all the social sciences. Th e word 'sociology' is derived from the Latin word *societus* meaning 'society' and the Greek word *logos* meaning 'study or science'. Th e etymological meaning of 'sociology' is thus the 'science of society'. Professor Ginsberg accordingly defi nes it as 'the study of society, that is, of the web or tissue of human interactions and interrelations'. In other words, sociology is the study of man's behaviour in groups or of interactions among human beings, of social relationships and of the processes by which human group activities take place.

## **NEED FOR A SCIENCE OF SOCIOLOGY**

Th e most distinctive feature of human life is its social character. All human beings interact with one another in order to survive. Aristotle, the great Greek philosopher, remarked that 'man is a social animal'. Both nature and necessity impel man to live in society. Man's behaviour in society is determined mainly by two forces—physical and social—which he has been trying to understand and control from time immemorial. His attempts to comprehend and control the natural phenomena had started earlier and were more successful than his attempts to understand the social phenomena. Th is is because it was easier for him to understand the physical phenomena by virtue of the fact that they were more concrete and hence more observable with a greater degree of detachment.

Nevertheless, man has been trying to take stock of his social environment and to understand the problems created by it since ancient times. But in these early stages man carried on the study of the diff erent aspects of society, giving rise to diff erent social sciences such as history, economics, political science, anthropology and psychology. Although, broadly speaking, all these social sciences deal with social phenomena and are, therefore, interrelated and interdependent, each concentrates on a particular phase of human conduct and specializes in studying it. History is the record of unique events relating to man; economics is concerned with the activities relating to production and consumption of wealth; political science deals with political activities and institutions; anthropology is the study of activities and institutions as they existed in times long past; psychology is interested in the springs of human action, the impulses and motives that sustain mental and bodily activity and regulate human conduct. Th ese social sciences may give a snapshot view of society from various angles of vision, but never a view of society in its comprehensive totality and utility. Th e need was, therefore, felt for a general science that should study society as a whole, and to achieve this 'sociology' was designed. Th us, the need of sociology was felt when other fi elds of human knowledge did not fully explain man's social behaviour. *Sociology is, on the one hand, a synthetic discipline, trying to unify the results of separate disciplines from a central point of view, and on the other hand, an analytic and specialized science with its own fi eld of research.* Sociology, essentially and fundamentally, deals with the network of social relationships known as society. No other science takes that subject for its central concern. As sociologists, we are interested in social relationships not because they are economic, political or religious, but because they are *social.* Th e focus of sociology is on *socialness.* At the same time, we should recognize that studying society does not mean studying everything that happens in society or under social conditions, because that includes the knowledge of all human activities. We shall not, for example, study religion as religion, art as art or government as government, but as forces that control social relations. Sociology is primarily interested in man's behaviour in relation to other men. Th at is, it focuses on relationships which are defi nitely 'social', making it a distinctive fi eld, however closely allied to others it may be. Th e study of social relationships themselves is the main interest of sociology.

## **DEFINITION OF SOCIOLOGY**

To understand sociology in detail, it shall be in the fi tness of things to study some of the defi nitions given by some important sociologists, and then conclude about the subject matter of this science, as agreed upon by most of them.

Some of the defi nitions of sociology are as follows:

|  |  |  |  |  | (a) 'Sociology is the science of society or of social phenomena'. | —L.F. Ward |
|--|--|--|--|--|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
|--|--|--|--|--|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|

**(b)** 'Th e subject matter of sociology is the interaction of human minds'. —*L.T. Hobhouse* 

**(c)** 'Sociology is the study of human interactions and interrelations, their conditions and consequences'. —*M. Ginsberg.* 

**(d)** 'Sociology is the study of the relationships between man and his human environment'. —*H.P. Fairchild*

**(e)** 'Sociology is a body of learning about society. It is a description of ways to make society better. It is social ethics, a social philosophy. Generally, however, it is defi ned as a science of society'. —*W.F. Ogburn* 

**(f)** 'Sociology in its broadest sense may be said to be the study of interactions arising from the association of living beings.' —*Gillin and Gillin*

**(g)** 'Sociology is the science which attempts the interpretive understanding of social action'. —*Max Weber* 

| (h) 'Sociology is the scientifi c study of the structure of social life'.     | —Young and Mack     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| (i) Sociology is a science for scientifi c social development'.               | —G. Duncan Mitchell |
| (j) 'Sociology is the science of the structure and functions of social life'. | —John W. Bennet     |

A perusal of the above defi nitions shows that sociologists diff er in their opinions about the subject matter of sociology. On the basis of all the defi nitions mentioned above, we conclude the following points about sociology:

Sociology is (a) a science of society, (b) a science of social relationships, (c) the study of social life, (d) the study of human behaviour in groups, (e) the study of social action, (f) the study of forms of social relationships, (g) the study of social groups or social systems.

However, the common idea underlying all the views is that sociology is concerned with human relationships. Its emphasis is on the 'social' aspect of these relationships. MacIver has clarifi ed that whatever topic may be included in the subject matter of sociology, its real subject matter is social relationships. Th e basis of social interactions or social processes is social relationships. It is on account of such relationships that there is human interaction. Th erefore, if we include social processes or any other matter within the subject matter of sociology, their study can be carried only in the context of social relationships. Man becomes a social animal only when he enters into social relationships. Th e diff erent aspects of social life —political or economic—are but the expressions of social relationships. Th erefore, sociology is in fact the study of social relationships in one form or the other. Its subject matter is society rather than the individual, though the individual cannot be left utterly out of account.

While studying social relationships, sociologists attempt to discover the evolution of society; its systems and structures; the development of social institutions and their functions; the customs and rules regulating social relationships; the groups and communities formed by man throughout history; the nature and interdependence of these groups such as family, caste, government, economic groups, religious groups and the phenomenon of social change.

## **SOCIOLOGY—A SCIENCE WITH ITS OWN SUBJECT MATTER**

Sociology is not only a science with its own subject matter but also the mother of all social sciences. Surprisingly enough, some critics state that sociology does not have a subject matter of its own and that it is a hotchpotch of diff erent social sciences. It is argued that social sciences such as economics, history and political science are specializations and that sociology is a mere collection of the observations and hypotheses from these fi elds. It may be stated that this view is 'totally incorrect', and today sociology is not only a separate science with a subject matter of its own but it has also acquired the high status that entitles it to be called the mother of all social sciences. While discussing the position of sociology among other social sciences, MacIver has rightly remarked that the social sciences have their sphere within sociology, just as associations have their sphere within community.

#### **Criticism Against Sociology Having a Subject Matter of Its Own**

Th e place of sociology as a science with its own subject matter has been criticized on three grounds.

**(a) Sociology is merely an assemblage of miscellaneous studies having social content.:** Th e answer to this criticism is that if the miscellaneous studies that sociology is supposed to

comprise have not been considered or treated by any other social science, sociology is certainly performing a useful function in sailing unchartered seas. It is impossible to deny that sociology has produced a great deal of valuable information about social institutions such as family, property, church and state; about social traditions; about social processes; about social classes and national and racial groups; about migration and population changes; about changes in social habits, customs and fashions; about factors of social control and about poverty, crime and suicide. None of these topics is adequately treated elsewhere. Th e claim of sociology to be a science with its own subject matter is further strengthened by the fact that it studies man's history and attainments as well as his biology, not themselves but only as phenomena that aff ect human interrelations or are aff ected by human interactions.

**(b)** Th e subject of sociology is parcelled out to a number of social sciences. Critics state that there is no special fi eld of sociology, since its subject matter has been parcelled out to a number of social sciences such as economics, political science, psychology, anthropology, history and jurisprudence. Th is criticism is not quite justifi ed as far as the above-mentioned subjects are concerned. But even if it were justifi ed, the existence of such separate sciences does not preclude the existence of a more general science whose task is to relate the separate conclusions of diff erent social sciences and deal with the more general conditions of social life. Just as the existence of botany, physiology, biochemistry, has not nullifi ed the utility of biology, similarly the existence of separate social sciences does not preclude the existence of sociology, which aims to develop a body of knowledge about human relationship to social life as a whole. As a matter of fact, social sciences are so numerous and detailed today that the need for a general science is not superfi cial, it is increasingly urgent.

**(c)** *Sociology borrows from other social sciences:* Sociology is said to be a labour-saving device for knowing everything without learning anything. But this criticism is also not valid. Th e essential nature of science is that it can grow only by borrowing. Biology develops by utilizing the conclusions of chemistry and physics, similarly sociology develops by borrowing from social sciences. But in borrowing, biology and sociology return far more to the sciences from which they borrow, enriching them with concepts and ideas that make the accumulation of facts meaningful.

Sociology, no doubt, borrows its subject matter from other social sciences, but it gives this subject matter a completely new form. To construct a building we collect materials such as cement, bricks, lime, iron, steel, sand and wood at a particular place, but the mere collection of material does not make a building. A technique is applied and the material is given a defi nite and fi xed form. It is only after the application of the technique that a building is erected and it no longer remains a heap of wood, bricks and cement. Similarly, sociology borrows raw materials, applies a technique and creates what is called 'society', and a separate discipline to study its structure and processes.

Again, the reason why sociology is so much more dependent on other social sciences than any other science lies in its magnitude and complexity. Th e fi eld of study of sociology—the totality of human relations—is so vast that no single person could cultivate all of it by himself. He must draw help from others. For example, to understand a particular society, a sociologist must know something of its people and their innate and acquired characters, its geographical environment, social institutions, languages, religions, moral laws, economic structure and, fi nally, its relations to other people and its interaction with the rest of the world. To do this satisfactorily, sociology must co-operate with a number of other sciences, which are as dependent upon the data and conclusions of sociology as sociology is upon them.

**(d)** *Th e subject matter of sociology is social life as a whole:* It is thus proved beyond any shadow of doubt that sociology is a science with its own subject matter, *social life as a whole*; and it deals with the more general principles underlying all social phenomena. In studying social life, it studies interactions not just as psychological behaviour but as social organization. Th e topic of social life is so complex that division of labour is needed to study it. So, we have economics, political science, law, that study social life from diff erent points of view. Sociology studies the same phenomena from sociological point of view. It studies every phenomenon with reference to its sociables. Th e sociological point of view is empirical and objective. Even at the risk of repetition it may be stressed again that sociology is not a mere synthesis of the studies undertaken by economics, history, political science, but is a complete discipline in itself as remarked by Sprott.

**(e)** It is the very discipline that attempts to consider societies as organic unities and to understand the relations between the various institutional complexes (economic, political and ideological) which pervade them.

**(f)** It is the very science that deals with human social groups as such, classifying them and analysing the nature of their structure.

**(g)** Th ere are topics such as social stratifi cation (class, caste,), changes in population rates and changes in the functions of the family that are not the subject matter of any other science. Sociology is a general science and studies many widely diff erent social institutions. As a general science, it is especially fi tted to deal with characteristics that are common to all groups and all societies. Its object is not so much to describe as to search for causes and explanations. Why do people behave in a particular manner is a common question in sociology.

## **SCOPE OF SOCIOLOGY**

Th ere is no one opinion about the scope of sociology. It is maintained by some that *sociology studies everything and anything under the sun.* Th is is rather too vague a view about the scope of sociology. As a matter of fact, sociology has a limited fi eld of enquiry and deals with those problems that are not dealt with by other social sciences.

In the broadest sense, sociology is the study of human interactions and interrelations, their conditions and consequences. Th us, ideally, sociology has for its fi eld the whole life of man in society, all the activities whereby men maintained themselves in the struggle for existence, the rules and regulations that defi ne their relations with each other, the systems of knowledge and belief, art and morals and any other capacities and habits acquired and developed in the course of their activities as members of society. But this is too wide a scope for any science to deal with properly. An attempt has therefore, been made to limit and demarcate the fi eld of sociology. Th ere are two main schools of thought among sociologists on this issue.

One group of writers headed by German sociologist, Simmel, demarcates sociology clearly from the other branches of social studies and confi nes it to the enquiry into certain defi ned aspects of human relationship. Th ey regard sociology as pure and independent. Th e other group maintains that the fi eld of social investigation is too wide for any one science and that if any progress is to be made there must be specialization and division. Th is group insists that in addition to special social sciences such as economics, anthropology and history there is also a need of general social science, that is, sociology, whose function would be to interrelate the results of the special social sciences

and to deal with the general conditions of social life. In the opinion of this group, sociology is a general science.

## **SPECIALISTIC OR FORMALISTIC SCHOOL**

**(a) Simmel's view:** According to Simmel, the distinction between sociology and other special sciences is that it deals with the same topics as they, but from a diff erent angle—from the angle of diff erent modes of social relationships. Th e social relationships, such as competition, subordination and division of labour, are exemplifi ed in diff erent spheres of social life such as economic, political and even religious, moral or artistic, but the business of sociology is to disentangle these forms of social relationships and to study them in abstraction. Th us, according to Simmel*,* sociology is a specifi c social science that describes, classifi es, analyses and delineates the forms of social relationships.

**(b) Small's view:** According to Small, sociology does not undertake to study all the activities of society. Every science has a delimited scope. Th e scope of sociology is 'the study of the generic forms of social relationships, behaviours and activities'.

**(c) Vierkandt's view:** Vierkandt, another leading sociologist, maintains that sociology is a special branch of knowledge concerned with the ultimate forms of mental or psychic relationships that link men to one another in society.

**(d) Max Weber's view:** Max Weber also makes out a defi nite fi eld for sociology. According to him, the aim of sociology is to interpret or understand social behaviour. But social behaviour does not cover the whole fi eld of human relations. Indeed, not all human interactions are social. For instance, a collision between two cyclists is in itself merely a natural phenomenon, but their eff orts to avoid each other or the language they use after the event constitutes true social behaviour. Sociology is thus, according to him, concerned with the analysis and classifi cation of the types of social relationships.

Th us, according to the formalistic school, sociology studies one specifi c aspect of social relationships, that is, their forms in their abstract nature and not in any concrete situation. A comparison is drawn between the forms of social relationships and a bottle. A bottle may be either of plastic or any other material. It may contain milk, water, but the contents of the bottle do not change the form of the bottle. Similarly, the forms of social relationships do not change with the change in the content of social relationships; for example, the study of competition—a form of social relationship—will not make any diff erence whether we study it in the political fi eld or economic fi eld. Th e formalistic school has limited the scope of sociology to the abstract study of the forms of social relationships.

## **Criticism of Formalistic School**

Th e formalistic school can be criticized on the following grounds:

**(a) It has narrowed the scope of sociology:** Sociology besides studying the general forms of social relationships should also study the concrete contents of social life.

**(b) Abstract forms separate from concrete relations cannot be studied:** Ginsberg maintains that a study of social relationships will remain barren if it is conducted in the abstract. Th e study of competition, for example, will be hardly of any use unless it is studied in concrete form in economic life or in the world of art and knowledge. Actually, social forms cannot be abstracted from the content at all, since social forms keep on changing as the content changes. In the words of Sorokin, 'We may fi ll a glass with wine, water or sugar without changing its form, but I cannot conceive of a social institution whose form would not change when its members change'.

**(c) Th e conception of pure sociology is impractical:** None of the sociologists have so far been able to construct a pure sociology. As a matter of fact, no social science can be studied in isolation from other social sciences.

**(d) Sociology alone does not study social relationships:** Sociology is not the only science that studies social relationships; political science, economics and international law also study social relationships.

Th us, the formalistic school has extremely narrowed and confi ned the fi elds of sociology.

## **SYNTHETIC SCHOOL**

Th e synthetic school wants to make sociology a synthesis of the social sciences or a general science; Durkheim, Hobhouse and Sorokin subscribe to this view.

**(a) Durkheim's view:** According to Durkheim, sociology has three principal divisions:

- (i) Social morphology
- (ii) Social physiology
- (iii) General sociology.

Social morphology is concerned with geographical or territorial basis of the life of people and its relation to types of social organizations. It also deals with the problems of populations such as its volume and density, local distribution and the like.

Social physiology is divided into a number of branches such as sociology of religion, morals, laws, economic life and languages. Each branch of sociology deals with a set of social facts, that is, activities related to the various social groups.

Th e function of general sociology is to discover the general characteristics of these social facts and to determine whether there are any general social laws of which the diff erent laws established by the special social sciences are particular expressions.

**(b) Hobhouse's view:** Hobhouse also holds a view similar to that of Durkheim regarding the functions of sociology. Ideally, for him, sociology is a synthesis of numerous social studies, but the immediate task of a sociologist is threefold. First, as a sociologist, he must pursue his studies in a particular part of the social fi eld. Th en, bearing in mind the interconnections of social relations, he should try to interconnect the results arrived at by the diff erent social sciences and, fi nally, he should interpret social life as a whole.

**(c) Sorokin's view:** According to Sorokin, the subject matter of sociology includes the following:

- (i) Th e study of relationships between diff erent aspects of social phenomena.
- (ii) Th e study of relationship between the social and non-social.
- (iii) Th e study of general features of social phenomena.
- **(d) Ginsberg's view:** Ginsberg has summed up the chief functions of sociology as follows:

First, sociology seeks to provide a classifi cation of types and forms of social relationships especially of those that have come to be defi ned as institutions and associations. Second, it tries to determine the

relation between diff erent parts of factors of social life; for example, the economic and the political, the moral and the religious, the moral and the legal, the intellectual and the social elements. Th ird it endeavours to disentangle the fundamental conditions of social change and persistence and to discover sociological principles governing social life.

## **CONCLUSION**

Th us, the scope of sociology is very wide. It is a general science, but it is also a special science. As a matter of fact, the subject matter of all social sciences is society. What distinguishes them from one another is their viewpoint. Th us, economics studies society from an economic viewpoint, political science studies it from political viewpoint, whereas history studies society from a historical viewpoint. Sociology alone studies social relationships and society itself. MacIver correctly remarks, 'What distinguishes each from each is the selective interest'. Green also remarks, 'Th e focus of attention upon relationships makes sociology a distinctive fi eld, however closely allied to certain others it may be'. Sociology studies all the various aspects of society such as social traditions, social processes, social morphology, social control, social pathology and eff ect of extrasocial elements on social relationships. Actually, it is neither possible nor essential to delimit the scope of sociology.

## **THE FIELDS OF SOCIOLOGY**

Th e scope of sociology being wide, an eff ort has been made to divide its study into diff erent fi elds. Th e main fi elds of sociology are as follows:

**(a) Sociological theory:** Th is includes the study of sociological concepts, principles and generalizations.

**(b) Historical sociology:** Th is includes the past social institutions and the origin of the present ones.

**(c) Sociology of family:** It studies the origin, growth, functions, kinds, nature of family and its problems like those of divorce, etc.

**(d) Human ecology and demography:** It studies the infl uence of population and geographical factors on society.

**(e) Sociology of community:** It is a study of community. It is divided into two parts:

- (i) Rural sociology
- (ii) Urban sociology

**(f) Special sociologies:** Recently, special sociologies have been developed to study the diff erent aspects of social relationships. Th us, we have the following branches of sociology:

- (i) Educational sociology
- (ii) Sociology of religion
- (iii) Economic sociology
- (iv) Political sociology
- (v) Sociology of law
- (vi) Social disorganization

- (vii) Criminology
- (viii) Social psychology
- (ix) Cultural sociology
- (x) Social psychiatry
- (xi) Folk sociology
- (xii) Industrial sociology
- (xiii) Sociology of art
- (xiv) Military sociology
- (xv) Medical sociology
- (xvi) Sociology of sickness
- (xvii) Sociology of recreation
- (xviii) Sociology of small groups
- (xix) Sociology of bureaucracy
- (xx) Sociology of social stratifi cation
- (xxi) Sociology of sex

In future we may have some new special sociologies.

## **SOCIOLOGY AS A SCIENCE**

Th ere is a controversy about the nature of sociology as a science. Th ere are some critics who deny sociology the claim to be regarded as a science. But there are others who assert that sociology is as much a science as other social sciences such as political science, history and economics.

#### **The Meaning of Science**

A science is 'a branch of knowledge or a study dealing with a body of facts or truths systematically arranged and showing the operation of general laws'. It gathers facts and links them together in their causal sequence, with a view to draw valid inferences. Scientifi c knowledge is based on reasons and evidences. It is therefore variable and communicable. Th e chief characteristics of a science are (i) the possibility of a concise, consistent and concrete formulation, (ii) the capacity to form generalizations and make predictions and (iii) the possibility of verifi cation of the data as well as of the generalizations. Th e various steps used in the scientifi c method are observation, recording, classifi cation, hypothesis, verifi cation and prediction.

According to William Esslinger, however, what distinguishes a science is that 'it is exclusively and methodically based on reason'. Experimentation and prediction are not its requirements. It only signifi es the existence of systematic methods of enquiry. According to Huxley also, science is a systematic body of knowledge based on reason and evidence.

#### **Sociology Cannot Be Regarded as a Science**

Th ose who deny the claim of sociology to be designated as a science advance the following objections:

**(a) Lack of experimentation:** If science is used in the same sense in which it is used for physical sciences, then sociology cannot claim to be a science. Th e term science as used for physical sciences

includes the twin processes of experimentation and prediction. Sociology in this sense is not a science because its subject matter, the human relationships, can neither be held, seen, weighed nor analysed in a test tube of any laboratory. Th ere are no instruments such as microscopes or thermometers to measure human behaviour. Sprott has remarked, 'If you cannot experiment, if you cannot measure, if you cannot establish broad unifying hypotheses and if you cannot be confi dent in your social engineering, you cannot be said to be engaged in scientifi c study at all'.

Th ere is no denying the fact that sociology cannot experiment and predict in the same way as physical sciences do, because the materials with which sociology deals – human behaviour and relationships – are so complex and variable that it is not possible to separate and analyse the diff erent elements as can be done in physical sciences. We can analyse the composition of water as two parts of hydrogen and one part of oxygen and illustrate by means of experiment in any laboratory of the world. But such experimentations in sociology are often diffi cult and impossible.

**(b) Lack of objectivity:** Th e second diffi culty of a sociologist in employing the scientifi c method is that he cannot maintain complete objectivity with the objects of his experiment, as does a physicist. Man has his own prejudice and bias. It is, therefore, not possible for him to observe his subject with complete detachment. Social relationships cannot be studied through physical senses. What we see in social relationships is only an outward expression of our inner life. A sociologist has, therefore, to concern himself with the working of the inner mind of his subject in order to understand his external actions properly. A physicist is not confronted with such a complex phenomenon.

**(c) Lack of exactivity:** Another characteristic of science is that it should be able to frame certain laws on the basis of observation and hypothesis and such laws should also enable us to predict accurately. From this point of view also, sociology cannot be called a real science because fi rstly its laws and conclusions cannot be expressed in precise terms and secondly its prediction might not come true. Others believe that dispassionate study of social phenomena is not possible, the investigator cannot be neutral, and he must take sides. Without neutral analysis science is impossible.

**(d) Terminological ineffi ciency:** It has also been argued that sociology suff ers from inexact and clear terminology. Same words convey diff erent meaning to diff erent persons; for example, the terms 'caste' and 'class' have not yet acquired exact meaning. Th e recent judgement of the Supreme Court in the Mandal Case has held that the concept of class cannot be separated from caste. Is caste a class? Sociology has not yet developed an adequate set of scientifi c terms. Our terminological ineffi ciency will remain an obstacle in the way of sociology developing into a science.

## **Sociology is a Science**

Th e critics in favour of sociology being a science assume that exactness of conclusions and capacity to predict alone make a study scientifi c. Meteorology fails to make accurate prediction. Shall we deny it the designation of science? In other words, universal validity of conclusions and a complete accuracy of prediction are not the criteria of science, what determines that the scientifi c character of a discipline is its methodology. If the methods of study are scientifi c, the subject deserves the rank of a science. Sociology does make use of scientifi c methods in the study of its subject matter and it is therefore entitled to be called a science. Following are the points supporting sociology to be designated as a science:

First, although sociology cannot experiment with men directly in a laboratory, their social behaviour is amenable to scientifi c investigation as any other natural phenomenon. Sociology does employ scientifi c methods as scales of sociometry, schedule, questionnaire, interview and case history, which apply quantitative measurements to social phenomenon and which are, therefore, comparable to the method of experimentation.

Second, two other basic methods of scientifi c investigation, observation and comparison, are readily available to the sociologist and he uses them all the time.

Th ird, all the physical sciences do not employ laboratory experimentation. Astronomy, for example, cannot experiment with its materials. Th e heavenly bodies cannot be induced to put in an appearance in the laboratory. If astronomy, in spite of its inability to experiment with its material in laboratory can be termed as science, there is no justifi cation to deny the title of science to sociology. Moreover, Newton and Archimedes did not invent their laws in the laboratory.

Fourth, sociology does frame laws and attempts to predict. It endeavours to discover laws that are generally applicable, regardless of variations in culture; for example, people always regulate marriage in such a manner as to prevent incest. Th ere are principles of sociology whose validity can be examined by anyone. Th ey are universal. Moreover, no science can boast of making infallible predictions. Many of the theories established by other sciences had to be modifi ed with change of time. As remarked by Sprott, 'Th e changes in theory which have followed one another so swiftly have made us less certain that what "science teaches" today will be what science will teach tomorrow'. In some areas of social life, prediction to a limited extent has been possible. According to Cuvier, the predictive value of sociology is being improved. As sociology matures and comes to understand more fully the principles underlying human behaviour, it will be in a better position to make accurate prediction.

Fifth, sociology delineates the cause-and-eff ect relationships. In its study of family it has traced the relationship between family disorganization and divorce, between urbanization and family disorganization as one of the causes of divorce. Th us, sociology traces the cause-and-eff ect relationship in social disorganization. It tries to fi nd an answer to 'how' as well as 'why' of social processes and relationships.

Sociology studies its subject matter scientifi cally. It tries to classify types and forms of social relationships. It tries to determine the relations between diff erent parts or factors of social life. It tries to deduce general laws from a systematic study of its material, and the conclusions drawn from the study of sociological principles are applied to the solution of social problems. Sociology is thus as much a science as other sciences concerning man.

#### **Can Sociology Be a Value-Free Science?**

In the above discussion we mentioned that sociology is a science. An important controversy that has developed in this connection is that, 'Can sociology be a value-free science?' By 'value-free' science we mean that sociology as a science should keep itself away from the question of social values and study social behaviour in its empirical sense. It is none of the tasks of sociology to point out the goodness or badness of social values and determine which values are ultimately good. Polygamy is good or bad, love marriage is desirable or undesirable, joint family system is useful or not, caste system is harmful or advantageous; sociology is not concerned with such issues. Its purpose is to make an empirical analysis of social institutions and not to lay down the norms regarding them. Diff erent societies in diff erent ages have believed in diff erent types of institutions. Sociology should isolate and test the empirical aspect of social behaviour without going into the value-laden question of whether the empirical propositions are true or false. Th e question of 'what ought to be' is beyond the scope of sociology. A correct decision on what is empirically true is not the same as a correct decision on what ought to be. While social facts can be subjected 'to empirical tests', values cannot. Values and facts are two separate things, and should be kept analytically distinct. Scientifi c enquiry should be value free.

Auguste Comte, to whom the credit of inventing the term 'sociology' is given, was primarily concerned with developing an empirical science of society. He tried to apply scientifi c method of social phenomena along with a theory of scientifi c and social process. Emile Durkheim was one of the founders 'of structural functionalism'. He analysed society from its structural–functional viewpoint. Herbert Spencer took an organic view of society, and he too was not concerned with the valuation aspect of society. But it was Max Weber (1864–1920), the German sociologist, who brought out the importance of keeping social analysis 'ethically neutral' or 'value free'. According to him, only a 'value-free' approach can facilitate scientifi c development. He tried to fence off social science from various irrational infl uences. Th e value bias of a scholar should not infl uence his analysis of social phenomena. According to Weber, science by its very nature cannot make a rationally justifi ed choice between value systems. Preferences in regard to values were largely based on one's beliefs and emotions and were not formed on the basis of facts or reasons. In other words, the social scientist as an objective investigator must remain neutral about value systems. It is not the task of a social scientist 'to off er binding norms and ideals or to provide recipes for practice'.

Weber's 'value-free approach' was continued and developed in contemporary neo-positivism. Th e neo-positivist methodology ruled out all restrictions, and 'value-free' principle did not mean simply 'free from politics', but also 'free from moral problems' and 'free from philosophy'. Hortwitz underlines the fact that the course of events identifi ed social science not only with neutrality but also with scholarly aloofness from moral issues.

To cut short, the value-free principle treats natural sciences as a model or pattern for social knowledge, which implies that the exact methods of natural sciences should be transferred to sociology in order to really make it a scientifi c discipline. Th e principle holds that sociology should be free of any value orientation. A sociologist should not make any value judgement. Moreover, the value-free principle looks upon sociology as a neutral discipline, which is not expected to draw any ideological or moral conclusion. It stands above ideology.

Th ere is a certain amount of confusion regarding what Max Weber actually meant by 'value-free science'. He did not reject 'value relatedness' of all sciences, as is usually made out. He made it clear that by the term value-free science he did not mean that all value judgments were to be withdrawn from scientifi c discussion in general, but that science holds only a limited role in the matter of value judgments. Th e utmost that the scientifi c treatment of value judgment could do was to bring them to the level of explicitness. Weber had clearly written that the making of the decision itself is not the task which science can undertake; it is rather the task of the acting, willing person; he weighs and chooses from among the values of the world. As to whether the person expressing these value judgements ought to adhere to those ultimate standards, is his personal aff air, it involves will and conscience, not empirical knowledge. An empirical science cannot tell anyone what he ought to do, but rather what he can do, and under certain circumstances what he wishes to do. With all his insistence on the limitations of science, Arnold Brecht writes, 'Max Weber never ceased personally to believe in ultimate values, nor did he ever underrate the importance of such belief for human personality and human dignity'.

## **SIGNIFICANCE OF SOCIOLOGY**

It is quite natural to ask about the value of sociology, the purpose that it serves and the gain that is derived by studying it. Th ere are some critics like Pareto who assert that sociology is hardly of any value because it does not deal with realities of life and it is only concerned with ideas that, devoid of scientifi c discoveries, are of very little importance in social life. But it is not a correct view about the value of sociology. A study of the important concepts of sociology will convince us that this science is of immense value.

**(a) Sociology makes a scientifi c study of society:** Prior to the emergence of sociology, the story of society was carried on in an unscientifi c manner and society had never been the central concern of any science. It is through the study of sociology that the true scientifi c study of the society has been made possible.

**(b) Sociology studies the role of the institutions in the development of the individual:** Again, it is through sociology that scientifi c study of the great social institutions and the relation of the individual to each is being made. Th e home and family, the school and education, the church and religion, the state and government, the industry and work, the community and association, all are the great institutions through which society functions. Sociology studies these institutions and their roles in the development of the individual and suggests suitable measures for restrengthening them with a view to enable them to serve the individual better.

**(c) Th e study of sociology is indispensable for understanding and planning of society:** Society is a complex phenomenon with a multitude of intricacies. It is impossible to understand it and to solve its various problems without the study of sociology. It is rightly said that we cannot understand and mend society without any knowledge of its mechanism and construction, just as no man in his senses will dream of trying to mend a motor car without knowing anything about its machinery and the way the diff erent parts fi t in with one another. Sociology bears the same relation to the solution of social problems as biology and bacteriology bear to medicine or mathematics and physics to engineering. Without the research done in the theoretical and experimental sciences, modern techniques for curing a disease or those for building a bridge will be impossible. Similarly, without the investigation carried on by sociology, no real eff ective social planning will be possible. It helps us to determine the most effi cient means for reaching the goals agreed upon. A certain amount of knowledge about the society is necessary before any social policies can be carried out. Suppose, for example, that a policy of decreasing the birth rate is considered desirable; the best means for achieving this goal cannot be determined in exclusively economic terms because matters of family organization, customs and traditional values must be taken into account and these require a sociological type of analysis.

**(d) Sociology is of great importance in the solution of social problems:** Th e present world suff ers from many social problems that can be solved only through scientifi c study of the society. It is obvious that social evils do not just happen and everything has its due cause. It is the task of sociology to study the social problems through the methods of scientifi c research and to fi nd out solutions for them. Th e scientifi c study of human aff airs will ultimately provide the body of knowledge and principles that will enable us to control the conditions of social life and improve them.

In order to have insight into and appreciate the motives by which others live and the conditions under which they exist, knowledge of sociology is essential. Now, we have begun to realize the intrinsic worth of man as man and the futility and hollowness of the diff erences of caste, colour, creed and other such factors. Th e racial or social diff erences that once separated man from man are now, with the study of sociology, losing their signifi cance and we are gradually moving towards the ideal concept of common brotherhood of man.

**(e) Sociology has changed our outlook with regard to the problems of crime:** Again, it is through the study of sociology that our whole outlook on various aspects of crime has changed.

Th e criminals are no longer treated as degenerated beasts. On the contrary, they are regarded as human beings suff ering from mental defi ciencies, and eff orts are accordingly made to rehabilitate them as useful members of the society.

**(f) Sociology has made great contribution to enrich human culture:** Human culture has been made richer by the contribution of sociology. Sociology has given us training to have rational approach to questions concerning oneself, one's religion, customs, morals and institutions. It has further taught us to be objective, critical and dispassionate. It enables man to have a better understanding both of himself and of others. Sociology also impresses upon us the necessity of overcoming narrow personal prejudices, egoistic ambitions and class hatred. In short, its fi ndings stimulate every person to render a full measure of service to every other person and to the common good.

**(g) Sociology is of great importance in the solution of international problems:** Th e question facing the world today is what will be the use of all the technological developments and scientifi c progress if men continue to be blood thirsty of each other. Th e study of sociology of war will help in understanding the underlying causes of war and remove all such causes that promote tensions between nations and ultimately lead to war.

**(h) Sociology is useful as a teaching subject:** In view of its importance, sociology is becoming popular as a teaching subject also. It is being accorded an important place in the curriculum of colleges and universities. It is also developing belatedly in professional colleges. By diff using knowledge about society, socialized thinking will emerge, socialized behaviour will develop, social planning will be furthered and a new social order will be evolved.

Th e importance of sociology is further proved by the fact that it is also included in the subjects to be off ered by candidates competing for the higher examinations such as Indian Administrative Service and the like. It is rightly felt that without the study of sociology, the training and knowledge of the candidates aspiring to hold a high post in the administrative set-up of their countries will be incomplete and imperfect.

(i) **Sociology as a profession:** Th e students of sociology have good career opportunities.

(ii) In factories and government—as labour welfare offi cer, human relations offi cer, personnel offi cer.

(iii) In employment exchange, unemployment insurance scheme, social security schemes.

(iv) In the fi eld of reformation of criminals—as probation offi cer, superintendents of juvenile homes, reformatory schools, etc.

(v) In the fi eld of social welfare—as social welfare offi cer, youth welfare offi cer, rural welfare offi cer, child welfare offi cer, Harijan welfare offi cer, tribal welfare offi cer.

(vi) In the fi eld of social education and adult education—as social education offi cer or adult education offi cer.

(vii) In the fi elds concerning widow welfare—as superintendents of Nari Niketan.

(viii) In the homes for 'the welfare of the old, disabled and destitute' as their superintendents.

(ix) In the fi elds of family planning—as social worker or researcher.

To sum up, the value of sociology lies in the fact that it keeps us up to date on modern situations, it contributes to making good citizens, it contributes to the solution of community problems, it adds to the knowledge of the society, it helps the individual fi nd his relation to society and so on. Professor Beach says 'Sociology has a strong appeal to all types of minds through its direct bearing upon many of the initial problems of the present world'.

In India, the importance of the study of sociology is still greater. Th e Indian society is undergoing a rapid transformation. Under the impact of the West, its mores are changing. Joint families are disintegrating. Th e strength of the bond of marriage is waning. Th e number of broken homes is increasing. Th ere is greater feeling of independence among women and children. Th e necessity for family planning is being experienced. Th e movies have vastly aff ected the mode of thinking and living. Linguism, regionalism and casteism are raising their ugly heads. Th e lust for power is strong enough among the political parties. Th ere is wide corruption at every level of governmental machinery. Th e problem of unemployment is very serious. Increasing urbanization has brought in its wake the problems such as homicide, slums, epidemics, crime, juvenile delinquency, group confl icts, pollution, etc. Th e 'mandalization' of society has led to acute intercaste war. Th e people are adopting more and more to agitational methods. Th ere is a major confusion in the system of education and a crisis of character everywhere.

Th e fi rst step towards a solution of the various problems besetting the Indian society is to understand the social background of these problems. Sociology will assist in understanding this background.

## **METHODS OF SOCIOLOGY**

Th e term 'method' means an apt way of doing something. Every science has to use an appropriate way or a suitable method of investigating into its fi eld of study. Sociology, as we have discussed earlier, is also a science. It would also, therefore, use certain methods by which sociological facts could be collected, analysed and put into proper form and certain conclusions drawn phenomenon and its use of methods, employed by other social sciences is quite proper. As the social phenomenon is very complex and the data to be collected are very large, it is diffi cult to suggest which particular method should be employed by sociology. Sociologists have, therefore, been employing various methods for investigating social phenomena.

Th e most common methods of sociology are discussed below.

#### **The Scientifi c or Experimental Method**

Th e scientifi c or experimental method consists of observation, recording, classifi cation, hypothesis, verifi cation and prediction. Observation means 'looking at' things. It is of two kinds: (a) spontaneous and (b) controlled. Th e former is conducted when the phenomenon in question is spontaneously happening; for example, when an astronomer is observing the course of star or a sociologist is witnessing a riot. Controlled observation, which is also called experimentation, takes place when the phenomenon can be observed in the circumstances devised by the observer himself. Experimentation can be defi ned as investigation in which the situation or the subjects are systematically manipulated by the investigator and controlled observation is made so that a defi nite hypothesis about the relation of variables can be tested.

Experimentation is possible only in natural sciences such as physics and chemistry, but it is not possible in social sciences such as sociology. In sociology, it is not possible to have the laboratory method because the raw material of sociological investigation is human being for whom it is not possible to live within certain fi xed conditions.

Th e second stage in the scientifi c method is *recording* of all the data obtained in the observation. Recording must be accurate and objective.

Th e third stage in the scientifi c method is the classifi cation. Once the facts are observed and recorded, we must classify them in a certain order. By classifi cation, we arrange our material in such a way that those facts that possess common characteristics are grouped together.

Next comes the stage of *hypothesis*, which means giving some sort of possible explanation for the correlation between the facts classifi ed. Th e correlation found between certain events and the study of their nature and mutual interaction lead us to formulate a provisional explanation of the fact. But it is not necessary that our hypothesis should be correct. It has to be purifi ed, tested on similar facts and if found to be incorrect, has to be discarded and a new one has to be formulated in its place. Th is process goes on till its truth is verifi ed.

Th en comes the last stage of *prediction*, which means that the generalization established on the basis of observation of facts will be valid in future also if the conditions specifi ed in our principle will prevail. Th e physical science can make true prediction, but sociology can give only rough prediction, as its subject matter is so varied and complex.

Sociology, thus, cannot make direct use of *experimental method*, as the human behaviour is too complex and diffi cult to be brought under controlled condition for observation, comparison and experimentation. However, experiments are being made by observing the facts as they actually exist, by classifying them, establishing correlation between them, giving provisional explanations, formulating general sociological principles and trying to make prediction as their basis. As a matter of fact, the use of scientifi c method diff ers from discipline to discipline according to the nature of its subject matter. Due to the peculiarities of human behaviour, scientifi c method cannot be used to the same extent and in the same sense in sociology as it can be used in physiological sciences.

#### **The Historical Method**

Th e historical method consists of a study of events, processes and institutions of past civilizations for the purpose of fi nding the origins, or antecedents of contemporary social life, and thus of understanding its nature and working. History and sociology are so much interrelated that some of the sociologists such as G.E. Howard regard history to be past sociology, and sociology to be present history. It is evident that our present forms of social life and our customs or ways of living have their roots in the past·and they can, therefore, be best explained when they are traced back to their sources. Th is can be possible only with the help of history.

But this method cannot help us in studying all the problems of sociology. Th e scope of sociology cannot be limited to the study of facts provided by history. Th e historical facts, as contained in life histories, diaries, etc., may be revealing, but they have little use for scientifi c investigation; they may not be able to answer all the questions that may be raised by a sociologist. Further, the historical facts also run the risk of not being studied objectively by the interpreters. Recently, such a question has been raised about the Indian history books published by NCERT for the social science classes.

#### **The Comparative or Anthropological Method**

Th e main task of sociology is to ascertain relations and interrelations between diff erent aspects of social life. Sociology cannot make proper use of the experimental method and all its various stages of observation, classifi cation hypothesis, generalization, etc. with regard to a particular social phenomenon in a laboratory as the physical sciences can do. But a sociologist can surely experiment in the laboratory of the world by employing the comparative method. Th is method involves comparisons of various kinds or groups of people in order to fi nd out the diff erences as well as similarities in their ways of life. Th us, this method tries to fi nd out the clues to man's social behaviour. Th is method has been used by many sociologists to fi nd out the elements in social life that are functionally correlated. Taylor used this method in the study of the institutions connected with the family among the primitive people. He was able to show that in all those families where the husband goes to live with his wife's people, the practice of the mother-in-law avoiding her son-in-law is found.

But the application of this method is not as simple as it may appear. Th e fi rst diffi culty in the application of this method is that social units have diff erent meanings in diff erent countries. Th e institution of marriage, for instance, has diff erent meanings for the people of India and for the Westerners. Indians consider marriage as an indissoluble sacred bond of union between husband and wife, whereas the Western people take it 'as a union of loose type, breakable at the will of either party'.

#### **The Statistical Method**

Th e statistical method is used to measure social phenomenon mathematically, that is, with the help of fi gures. According to Bogardus, 'Social statistics is mathematics applied to human facts'. Odum writes, 'Statistics which is the science of numbering and measuring phenomena objectively is an essential core of research'. It is obvious that statistics can be used with advantage where the problem can be expressed in quantitative terms as in measuring the growth of population, the increase of birth and death rates, the rise and fall in income, etc. Prof. Giddings was the fi rst great sociologist to emphasize the importance of statistics for sociological researches. Much of the research work in sociology is currently being carried on with the help of the data collected through statistics; for example, in studying population, migration, economic conditions, human ecology, etc.

But the great diffi culty in adopting the statistical method is that mostly the social problems are qualitative and not quantitative. Th is method can therefore be used in a limited sphere only.

#### **The Social Survey Method**

Th e social survey method consists of the collection of data concerning the living and working conditions of people in a given area with a view to formulating practical social measures for their betterment and welfare.

Some of the defi nitions of social survey are as follows:

**(a) Mark Abrams:** 'A social survey is a process by which quantitative facts are collected about the social aspect of a community's composition and activities'.

**(b) A.F. Wells:** 'Social survey is a fact-fi nding study dealing chiefl y with working-class poverty and with the nature and problems of a community'.

**(c) E.W. Burgess:** 'A social survey of a community is the scientifi c study of its conditions and needs for the purpose of presenting a constructive programme of social advance'"

**(d) Bogardus:** 'A social survey is the collection of data concerning the living and working conditions; broadly speaking of the people in a given community'.

Th us, social survey is concerned with collection of data relating to some problems of social importance with a view to formulating a constructive programme for their solution. It is conducted within a fi xed geographical limit. Social surveys are of various types, which not only provide detailed accounts

of the social and economic facts but also bring home various social evils prevalent among the people of the area concerned, and thereby draw the attention of the government to eradicate these evils by passing appropriate legislation. America and England have been making use of social surveys since long on a very large scale to solve some of their social problems. India and other underdeveloped countries are also now benefi ting from social surveys both in the urban and rural areas.

#### **The Case Study Method**

Th e case study method is employed in studying an individual case or that of a group, a community or an·institution. Th e contention underlying it is that any case being studied is a representative of many, if not all, similar cases, and hence will make generalizations possible.

Some of the techniques used in the method are interviews, questionnaires, life histories, documents of all kinds having a bearing on the subject and all such materials that may enable a sociologist to have a deep insight into the problem.

Case work is based on the principles of acceptance, self-determination and confi dentiality. Th e principle of acceptance refers to the attitude of the worker, his respect for the client as an individual that gives him a sense of security and encourages him to speak about his problem frankly. Th e principle of self-determination allows the client to decide for himself rather than deciding for him. Th e principle of confi dentiality implies that the relationship between the case worker and the client is one of trust and whatever is revealed to the worker is to be kept confi dential and is not to be shared with anyone except in the interest of the client with his permission.

Case work is used in a variety of settings such as child care and child guidance institutions, schools, colleges, medical and psychiatric settings, family welfare, marriage counselling centres, institutions for the old and infi rm as well as handicapped and also with people who suff er from addiction, character disorders, emotional disturbances and the like.

#### **Questionnaire and Interview Method**

Questionnaires and interviews are very common and popular research tools of the sociologists. A questionnaire is a list of important and pertinent questions concerning a problem. It is sent to persons and associations concerned, requesting them to answer the questions to the best of their knowledge and ability. From the answers received to certain questions, predictions are made about the social behaviour. It is necessary that proper care should be taken in formulating questions; they should not be ambiguous, too many or too personal, nor too diffi cult to be answered by a man of average intelligence and common understanding.

Th e questionnaire technique is being used all over the world to collect necessary data about a particular situation or problem. Th e Kothari Commission, 1964 had circulated a questionnaire regarding reforms in the educational system of the country and other matters connected with it. It was on the basis of the facts thus collected that the Commission had made its recommendations to the Government.

In the interview method direct personal contact is made with persons or groups concerned who are in any way connected with the problem under study. Discussion of the problem with the person interviewed at personal level goes a long way out in clearly understanding his/her problems and remedying them accordingly. Th us, information can be obtained either by interview or by questionnaire. Th e questionnaire has the great advantage of anonymity, making for more truthful answers. It also serves to cut out uncontrolled personal infl uences; and there is less likelihood of bias in the coding of replies. Th e interview is in general more fl exible. Since the same question can have diff erent meanings to diff erent people, the interviewer can remove such misunderstanding. He can probe for true replies and make ratings based on the whole of the subjects' behaviour. He can change the order of questions and prevent the subject looking over the whole list before answering. Th us, the choice of method should be made very carefully.

## **The Public Opinion Poll Method**

Th e public opinion poll method is used to seek and gauge the beliefs, sentiments and attitudes of the public on any given proposition. Public poll is very popular in the West where data regarding public opinion about various social, economic and political situations are collected through this instrument very frequently. Th e public gives its views by answering 'yes', 'no' or 'do not know' to the proposition. Th e results of the 'public poll' help the authorities concerned in modifying their policies accordingly.

## **Functionalism or Structural Functional Method**

Th e approach of functionalism is being given great importance in the study of social phenomena by some sociologists. By this method, we try to interpret any part of society in terms of its functions and not in terms of its utility and origin. Functionalism, in other words, refers to the study of social phenomena from the point of view of the functions that particular institutions such as family, class, religion and political institutions serve in a society. It is a functional analysis of the diff erent parts of society. According to R.K. Merton, it depends upon a triple alliance between theory, method and data. Function is the contribution that a partial activity makes to the total activity, of which it is a part. Th e functional method assumes that the total social system of the society is made up of parts which are interrelated and interdependent, each performing a function necessary to the life of the group. Th ese parts can best be understood in terms of the functions that they perform or in terms of the needs they meet. And since they are interdependent we can understand them only by investigating their relationship to other parts as well as to the whole social system.

Merton has mentioned the following major procedures of functional analysis:

- **(a)** Establishment of functional requirements.
- **(b)** Explanation of structure and process.
- **(c)** Search of compensating mechanisms.
- **(d)** Detailed description of the structure.
- **(e)** Detailed description of the functional systems.

According to Merton, the following points should be carefully studied in the functional analysis of social phenomena:

- **(a)** Location of statuses of participants in the social structure
- **(b)** Alternative modes of behaviour.
- **(c)** Description of the attitude towards the pattern.
- **(d)** Motivation for participating in the pattern.
- **(e)** Associated unrecognized regularities of behaviour.

Th e functional approach was employed by sociologists such as Comte, Spencer and others and anthropologists such as Malinowski and Radcliff e Brown. Th e American sociologists such as Parsons and Merton have elaborated this method and named it the *structural functional method* because of the emphasis that it lays on social structures or institutions in studying the phenomena. Structures refer to those arrangements within the system that perform the functions, whereas functions deal with the consequences involving objectives as well as processes of patterns of action.

But this approach is not without defects. It is not proper to lay all the stress on the functional aspect of the society. Each social institution has uniqueness of the origin, utility, etc. Moreover, the society is dynamic and this static approach is not going to take us very far.

## **BRANCHES OF SOCIOLOGY**

Sociology is broadly defi ned as the study of human society. Society is vast and complex phenomenon and, therefore, it is generally debatable that which part of society should be studied by sociology. Accordingly, the sociologists have divided the study into diff erent branches.

According to Durkheim, sociology has broadly three principal divisions

- **(a)** Social morphology
- **(b)** Social physiology
- **(c)** General sociology

Social morphology covers the geographical settings, the density of population and other preliminary data that are likely to infl uence the social aspects. Social physiology is concerned with dynamic processes such as religion, morals, laws, economic and political aspects, etc., each of which may be the subject matter of a special discipline. General sociology is an attempt to discover the general social laws that may be derived from the specialized social processes. Th is is considered by Durkheim as the philosophical part of sociology.

Max Weber combines two schools of thought, that is, historical and systematic and he adds something more. His analysis with regard to relations between economics and religion enables him to use both historical and systematic methods. Th e sociologies of law, economics and religion are the special sociologies that are the part of both systematic and historical methods of study.

According to Sorokin, sociology can be divided into two branches: (a) general sociology and (b) special sociology. General sociology studies (i) properties and uniformities common to all social and cultural phenomena in their structural and dynamic aspects and (ii) the interrelationships between the sociocultural and biological phenomena. In the structural aspects, sociology studies various types of groups and institutions as well as their interrelations to one another. In the dynamic aspect, sociology studies various social processes such as social contact, interaction, socialization, confl ict, domination and subordination. Th e special sociologies study a specifi c sociocultural phenomenon that is selected for detailed study. According to Sorokin, some of the most developed sociologies are sociology of population, rural sociology, urban sociology, sociology of family, sociology of law, sociology of religion, sociology of knowledge, sociology of war, sociology of revolution, sociology of disorganization, sociology of fi ne arts, sociology of economic phenomena and many others.

Ginsberg has listed the problems of sociology under four aspects:

- **(a)** Social morphology
- **(b)** Social control

- **(c)** Social processes
- **(d)** Social pathology

Social morphology includes investigation of the quantity and quality of population, the study of social structure or the description and classifi cation of the principal types of social groups and institutions. Social control includes the study of law, morals, religions, conventions, fashions and other sustaining and regulating agencies. Social processes refer to the study of various modes of interactions between individuals or groups including co-operation and confl ict, social diff erentiation and integration, development and decay. Social pathology refers to the study of social maladjustments and disturbances.

Samuel Koenig has also referred to the major fi elds of sociology. Th ese are as follows: Sociological theory analyses principles, concepts and generalization of sciences. Historical sociology studies societies of remote as well as of recent past to discover origins of, and fi nd explanations for, our present ways of life. Sociology of family considers the origin, evolution and function of this institution, the forms it has assumed in various periods of history and in diff erent societies as well as the contemporary problems connected with it. Human ecology and demography investigates the spatial distribution of human groupings (primarily communities and neighbourhoods), their relationship to one another and the forces determining their distribution and relationship, and also analyses population changes and movements. Th e community (a fi eld closely allied with and dependent upon ecology and demography) analyses the organization and problems of both rural and urban types of communities. Since the problems of city and country are in many respects quite distinct, this fi eld of study is subdivided into rural and urban sociology. Sociology of religion studies the church as a social institution enquiring into its origin, development and forms as well as into changes in its structure and function. Education sociology studies the objectives of the school as a social institution, its curricular and extracurricular activities and its relationship with the community and other institutions. Political sociology studies the social implications of various types of political movements and ideologies and the origin, development and functions of the government and the state. Sociology of law concerns itself with formalized social control, or with the processes whereby members of a group achieve uniformity in their behaviour through the rules and regulations imposed upon them by society. It inquires into the factors that bring about the formation of regulatory systems, as well as into the reasons for their adequacies and inadequacies as a means of control. Social psychology seeks to understand human motivation and behaviour, as they are determined by society and its values. It studies the socialization process of individuals, that is, how they become members of society; it also studies the public, the crowd, the mob and various other social groupings and movements. Analysis of mass persuasion, or propaganda, and of public opinion has been one of its major interests. Social psychiatry deals with the relationships between social and personal disorganization, its general hypothesis being that society, through its excessive and confl icting demands upon the individual, is to a large extent responsible for personal maladjustments, such as various types of mental disorders and antisocial behaviour. In its applied aspects, it is concerned with remedying this situation. Social disorganization deals with the problems of maladjustment and malfunctioning, including problems of crime and delinquency, poverty and dependency, population movements, physical and mental disease and vice and prostitution. Of these subdivisions, crime and delinquency have received perhaps the greatest attention and have developed into the distinct fi elds of criminology. Group relations is concerned with studying the problems arising out of the coexistence in a community of diverse racial and ethics groups.

Although the foregoing are the main divisions of sociology, new areas and subareas are evolved as the problems coming within the scope of this science are explored more thoroughly and systematically, and as new techniques are devised and developed for dealing with them. Th us, in addition to the areas listed above, there are a number of others such as cultural sociology, folk sociology, sociology of arts, industrial sociology, medical sociology, military sociology and sociology of small groups and special topics such as social stratifi cation, mass media of communication, public opinion and bureaucracy.

## **RELATION OF SOCIOLOGY WITH OTHER SOCIAL SCIENCES**

Sociology has been defi ned as a science of society. It endeavours to study the social life as a whole. But the social life is so complex that it is impossible to isolate social problems from the whole range of human experience. Th e life of man is many-sided. Th ere is an economic aspect, a legal aspect, an aesthetic aspect, a religious aspect, a political aspect and so forth. Sociology, therefore, can understand social life as a whole by taking help from other social sciences that study exclusively one or the other aspects of human activity.

## **Sociology and History**

Sociology and history are so intimately related that writers like Von-Bulow have refused to acknowledge sociology as a science distinct from history. History is the record of the life of societies of men, of the changes that the societies have gone through, of the ideas that have determined the actions of these societies and of the material conditions that have helped or hindered their development. Sociology is concerned with the study of the historical development of the societies. It studies the various stages of life, modes of living customs, manners and their expression in the form of social institutions. Sociology, thus, has to depend upon history for its material. Arnold Toynbee's book, *A Study of History* has proved to be very valuable in sociology. History supplies facts that are interpreted and co-ordinated by the sociologists. In the same way, sociology gives the social background for the study of history. History is now being studied from the sociological point of view. It is rightly said that the *study of history would be meaningless without the appreciation of social signifi cance.* If history is to be useful to understand the present and to serve as a guide for the future, sociological interpretation of facts is absolutely essential. It is because of their mutual dependence upon each other that has led G.E. Howard to remark that history is past sociology, and sociology is present history.

But in spite of their close relationship the two subjects are distinct.

**(a) History is concrete and sociology is abstract:** Th ere is much in history that has no direct relation to sociology, whereas there is much in sociology that is not in history. According to Park, 'History is the concrete, whereas sociology is the abstract science of human experience and human nature'.

**(b) Sociology and history have diff erent attitudes:** History deals with events in all their aspects, whereas sociology studies them from the viewpoint of social relationship involved. For example, the historians will describe a war and all the circumstances accompanied with it, whereas sociologists will try to understand a war as a social phenomenon. Th ey will study its impact on the lives of the people, their social institutions, etc.

## **Sociology and Political Science**

Sociology and political science have been very closely related to each other till recently. According to Morris Ginsberg, 'Historically, sociology has its main roots in politics and philosophy of history'*.*  Th e signifi cant works on social subjects such as *Plato's Republic*, *Politics of Aristotle* and other classical works were meant to be complete treatise on political science. Th e two subjects have, even now, much in common. Political science is a branch of social science dealing with the principles of organization and government of human society. In other words, political science deals with the social groups organized under the sovereign of the state. It is rightly said that without the sociological background the study of political science will be incomplete. Th e forms of government, the nature of governmental organs, the laws and sphere of the state activity are determined by the social process. Barnes has written, 'Th e most signifi cant thing about sociology and modern political theory is that most of the changes which have taken place in the political theory in the last 30 years have been along the line of development suggested and marked out by sociology'.

In the same way, sociology also depends on political science for its conclusions. Th e special study of the political life of society is indisposable for the complete study of society as a whole. According to Comte and Spencer, there is no diff erence whatsoever between the two. G.E.G. Catlin has remarked that political science and sociology are two facets or aspects of the same fi gure. In the opinion of F.G. Wilson, 'It must be admitted of course, that it is often diffi cult to determine, whether a particular writer should be considered as sociologist, political theorist or philosopher'. Eminent sociologists like Durkheim, Malinowski, Parsons, Spencer, Merton, Max Weber and Leryhaix made important contributions to the fi eld of political science. Political sociology is an interdisciplinary science that seeks to combine sociological and political approaches.

Th e two subjects are, however, diff erent from each other.

**(a) Sociology is the science of society, whereas political science is the science of state:** Gilchrist says, 'Sociology studies man as a social being and as political organization, it is a special kind of social organization; political science is a more specialized science than sociology'.

**(b) Th e scope of sociology is wider than that of political science:** Political science studies the state and government only, whereas sociology studies all the social institutions.

**(c) Sociology deals with social man, whereas political science deals with political man:** Sociology being the science of society deals with man and all his associated processes, whereas political science being the science of the political society is concerned with only one form of human association.

**(d) Sociology is a general science, whereas political science is a special science:** Political organization is a special kind of social organization and that is why political science is a special science while sociology is a general science.

**(e) Sociology is the study of both organized and unorganized communities. Political science deals with organized communities only:** Sociology deals with both organized and unorganized communities, whereas political science is concerned only with organized communities. As such sociology is prior to political science.

**(f) Sociology deals with unconscious activities also:** Unlike political science, which treats only conscious activities of man, sociology treats unconscious activities of man also.

**(g) Diff erence in approach:** Political science starts with the assumption that man is a political being, sociology goes behind this assumption and tries to explain how and why man became a political being.

#### **Sociology and Economics**

Th e society is infl uenced by economic factors, whereas economic processes are largely determined by the social environments. Th is fact clearly proves that the relation between sociology and economics is very intimate. Economics is defi ned as a study of mankind in ordinary business of life or to be precise, it is the science of wealth in its three phases of production, distribution and consumption. It is thus concerned with that part of individual and social action that is most closely connected with the attainment and with use of material requisites of well-being. Economics, in other words, is concerned with material welfare of the human beings. But economic welfare is only a part of human welfare and it can be sought only with the proper knowledge of social laws. Economics cannot go far ahead without the help of sociology and other social sciences. For instance, in order to solve economic problems of unemployment, poverty, business cycle or infl ation, an economist has to take into consideration the social phenomena existing at a particular time. Sociology is, thus, of considerable help to economics in providing specifi c data into which economic generalizations may be fi tted. Economic and social order is inextricably interwoven. Many of the problems of sociology and economics are common. Th e problems of population growth, environmental pollution, slum clearance, child and family welfare and urbanization are as much economic as sociological, which cannot be solved unless and until the social attitudes of the people are given due consideration. Th e theories of socialism, communism, democracy and welfare state are nothing but the theories of social reorganization. According to Th omas, 'Economics is, in fact, but one branch of the comprehensive science of sociology'.

In the same way, sociology is infl uenced by economics. Economic forces play a very important role in every aspect of our social life. It is for this reason that sociologists have been concerned with economic institutions. Th e earliest sociologists like Spencer have included the economic activity of man in their analysis of social relationships. Sumner, Durkheim and Weber also approached the study of society through its economic institutions. Karl Marx and Fredrick Engels had gone to the extent of asserting that economic factor was the sole motive force of the society. Since their times, economic determination (economic conditions have a determining infl uence over the social) has found a signifi cant place in the theories of many social scientists seeking to explain this vital phenomenon.

In spite of interdependence of these two sciences, as explained above, they are quite distinct from each other.

**(a) Th e fi eld of sociology is wider:** Th e fi eld of economics is restricted only to the economic activities of man, whereas sociology is concerned with all the relationships that are not simply economic but social. Th e scope of sociology is thus much wider than that of economics.

**(b) Sociology has a comprehensive viewpoint:** An economist's primary concern is with all that is directly or indirectly related to the increase of material happiness of man, with the methods and techniques of production, distribution and consumption. But sociologist, on the other hand, is primarily interested in the social aspects of economic activities rather than in the mechanism of production and distribution.

**(c) Economics is much older than sociology:** Although economics is much older than sociology, philosophers like Comte would subordinate economics to, and include it in, sociology. Sociology is a science of only recent growth, whereas economics has attained an advanced degree of maturity.

#### **Sociology and Ethics**

Ethics is the science of morality. It is concerned with the moral rightness and wrongness of human action. Ethics and sociology are intimately related to each other. Man is a social being. He acquires moral standards notions of right and wrong as a member of a special group. In other words, it is the society that infl uences the mental and moral development of the individual and it is the individual who in return seeks to conform to his actions to the moral standards of his social group. Th us, the real signifi cance of moral life lies amidst a social group or in society.

Sociology is primarily concerned with the study of the social groups and it investigates into all aspects of human life—economic, political, religious, moral and cultural. Ethics throws light on the moral life of the primitive individuals and institutions. Th is provides a background of human conduct and may thus serve a good purpose for contrasting and comparing the moral conduct of the modern life with that of the primitive man. Further, the personal good of the individual must at the same time be in harmony with the general good of the society as a whole. It is here that both sociology and ethics come close to each other. Th is close relationship between the two has induced some ethical thinkers to regard ethics as a branch of sociology.

But the two sciences also diff er in some essential aspects. First, sociology is a positive science, whereas ethics is a normative science. Sociology studies institutions, customs and manners as they are or have been, whereas ethics looks upon them as they ought to be. Second, sociology studies men and their social relations collectively, whereas ethics studies men individually as moral agents of the society. Th ird, sociology is merely speculative and has no practical bearing on any fi eld of social life. Ethics, on the other hand, has some practical bearing on our conduct. It seeks to formulate the rules of conduct, which all people should observe. Fourth, sociology employs mainly historical methods in the investigation of its problems. Ethics, on the other hand, seeks to explain human conduct with reference to an end or ideal. Finally, while sociology is concerned with the study of progress of social groups from the point of view of time, ethics is concerned with the progress of society from the point of view of morality.

#### **Sociology and Social Psychology**

Social psychology deals with the mental processes of man considered as a social being. It studies particularly the infl uence of group life on the mental development of an individual, the eff ect of the individual mind on the group and the development of the mental life of the groups within themselves and in their relations with one another. Sociology, on the other hand, studies the various kinds of groups that compose the society.

Social psychology has to depend on sociology to properly understand human nature and behaviour, as it is sociology that provides the necessary material regarding the structure, organization and culture of the societies to which individuals belong. Th e sociologists in turn also have to draw up social psychology. Th ey recognize the importance of psychological factors, among other things, in understanding the changes in social structure. Lapiere and Fransworth write that 'social psychology is to sociology and psychology as biochemistry is to biology and chemistry'. According to Motwani, 'Social psychology is a link between psychology and sociology'. As a result of the close relation between the two, Karl Pearson has not accepted the two as separate sciences. In other words, according to MacIver, 'Sociology in special gives aid to psychology, just as psychology gives special aid to sociology'. It is now generally assumed that a scientifi c study of social phenomenon must have a psychological basis; and the psychological facts regarding human nature should not be assumed, but should be explored by direct observation as well as experimentation.

McDougall and Freud were of the view that whole of the social life could be reduced fi nally to psychological forces. In that case, sociology would be reduced to a mere branch of psychology. But this view cannot be accepted, as the causes aff ecting social behaviour are other than psychological, such as the economic, geographical and political . Social life, therefore, cannot be studied exclusively with the methods of the psychologists. Th e fact of mutual dependence of social psychology and sociology should not be interpreted to mean that one is either identical with or the branch of the other. As a matter of fact, there are important points of distinction between these two related fi elds of investigation.

**(a) Diff erence of subject matter:** Sociology is a study of the society as a whole, whereas social psychology is merely the study of individuals in interaction as the members of groups and of the eff ect of that interaction on them.

**(b) Diff erence of attitudes:** Sociology and social psychology deal with social life from diff erent angles. Th e former studies society from the viewpoint of the community element, whereas the latter from the viewpoint of psychological factors involved.

## **Sociology and Jurisprudence**

Jurisprudence is the science of law. It is concerned with the study of the entire body of legal principles. Jurisprudence and sociology are intimately related to each other. Sociology is the study of man in society. Law controls and regulates the actions of human beings in society and it is, therefore, a subject of great importance for the sociologists. Th ere is, however, a diff erence in the approach of a sociologist and that of a lawyer to the subject of law. A lawyer is concerned with the rules that men ought to obey; he is not interested in knowing how and to what extent these rules govern the behaviour of ordinary citizens. A sociologist, on the other hand, is interested in law as a social phenomenon. His chief concern is not with the rules themselves, but with whether they are observed or not and in what way. A sociologist's study of law from this angle has been given the title of Sociology of Law or Sociological Jurisprudence. Criminology and penology are its important branches. Criminology is concerned with the systematic study of crime and criminal behaviour from the social point of view. Penology studies the eff ects of various penal systems of punishment and the effi cacy of reform and rehabilitation schemes in changing criminal behaviour. Th ese branches of legal sociology have rendered great service to the lawmakers and law executors by adding to their knowledge how the laws actually work and how the crime can be eff ectively dealt with. Sociology has thus shed considerable light and understanding on the various problems that the society has to solve, particularly, from the point of view of criminal jurisprudence. Consequently, jurisprudence has assumed a new meaning that laws are to be made for the men, and the lawmakers and its executors are to take into consideration the human and the social aspect while making or executing it.
