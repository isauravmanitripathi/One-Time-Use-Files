# **Village Community**

![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg)

Villages play an important part in Indian life. From the prehistoric times, the village has been enjoying an important place as the unit of Indian social structure. India can rightly be called a land of villages. A bulk of India's population lives in the villages. According to the census of 2001, about 75 per cent of the total population lives in villages. Th ere are around 5,75,721 villages in the country.

### **CHARACTERISTICS OF INDIAN VILLAGES**

**(i) Isolation and self-suffi ciency:** Almost till the middle of the nineteenth century, the villages in India were more or less self-contained, isolated, and self-suffi cient units. Th e inhabitants of the village had very little to do with the people outside. All of their essential needs were satisfi ed in the village itself. Th is feature of the Indian village is described as follows:

Each village tends to be self-contained, in each will be found persons with permanent rights in the land as owners or tenants with hereditary occupancy rights, of these some cultivate all they hold, others with large areas at their disposal rent out to tenants on a yearly agreement a part or whole of their lands, below these in the scale are agricultural labourers â€¦ some have a fi eld or two on rent, some work in the fi eld only at times of pressure and are mainly engaged in craft s, such as leather work, or in tasks regarded as menial, in all but the smallest village, there are one or two skilled artisans, carpenters or blacksmiths who provide and repair the simple agricultural implements, bullock gear, and water-lift s. Th e household requirements are supplied by a shop 'or two whose owners usually provide the fi rst market for the village produce and add to their earnings in money lending.

In short, it was more of a society within itself.

 However, changing political and economic conditions are putting an end to the isolation and self-suffi ciency of the Indian village. Th e rapid development of the means of transport and communication has broken the barriers between the village and city. Th e former is now socially and even economically connected with the neighbourhood city or town. Political parties have made village the centre of their activities as much as the city.

**(ii) Peace and simplicity:** Th e second feature of an Indian village is the atmosphere of simplicity, calmness, and peace prevailing therein. In the village, there is no noise and little sophistication. Th e humdrum activities of the modern civilization are rarely seen there. Although occasionally a car or a bus rolling along the kuchcha road enveloped in thick clouds of dust may be seen there, but, on the whole, life in the village moves with traditional quietude and peace. Th e villagers lead a simple life, eat frugally, dress simply, and live in mud-walled houses completely lacking in the trappings of modern civilization. Th ey have a sense of unity and personally know each other.

 But here also the old order is yielding place to a new one. Th e mud-walled houses are giving place to well-designed buildings. Fashion is making its inroads in the life of young men and women of the village. Here and there notes of music issue from dry-cell radio. However, this change is gradual and slow.

**(iii) Conservatism:** Th e inhabitants of the village are strongly attached to old customs and traditions. Th eir outlook is primarily religious and conservative and they accept changes with extreme reluctance. Th ey have close neighbourhood relations and love old ways and are less eager to follow the advice of zealous social reformers regarding their marriage and other customs. Writing on Indian villages, Sir Charles Metcalfe wrote, 'they seem to last where nothing else lasts. Dynasties tumble down, revolution succeeds revolution. Hindu, Pathan, Mughal, Marathe, Sikh, English all the masters change in turn, but the village communities remain the same'.

**(iv) Poverty and illiteracy:** Probably the most glaring and also depressing features of Indian villages are the poverty and illiteracy of the village people. Th ey are generally poor with a very low income. Th ey take coarse food and put on rough clothes. Th e pressure on land is high resulting in fragmentation of holdings and poor productivity. Besides poverty, the village people are steeped in ignorance and illiteracy. Th e opportunities for education are meager in the village. Th e village school is generally in a dilapidated condition. Facilities for higher education are practically nil. Due to poverty, the villagers cannot send their children to the city for education. Due to illiteracy, they cannot improve upon their agriculture or supplement their income by other means. Poverty is thus the cause and eff ect of illiteracy and the backwardness of the villagers.

 However, recently, the need has been realized for rural reconstruction. An all India organization under the name of 'All India Kissan Sammelan' has been formed to focus the attention of the government on the problems of peasantry class. Th ere is greater realization now that the country can march ahead only if its villages are prosperous. Th e governments, both at the centre and states, have launched numerous schemes such as total literacy programme, fertilizer subsidy, crop insurance, free power, concessional water rate, minimum procurement price, and low interest loans for liquidating illiteracy and removing poverty of the people living in the villages. Agricultural production is becoming more and more mechanized and agricultural products are fetching high prices.

**(v) Local self-government:** Th e villages in ancient India enjoyed a considerable measure of autonomy or self-government. Th e villagers managed their own aff airs through the traditional institution of panchayat. Th e central government had neither the inclination nor the means for interfering with the self-government of the villages. With the advent of British in India and their introduction of a highly centralized system of administration, the importance of panchayats began to decline. Th eir judicial powers were taken over by the British courts and the offi cers were appointed to look after the administrative aff airs of the villages. Th is change produced unpleasant results. Since the times of Lord Ripon, attempts were made to revive the old system of village local self-government, but the progress was very slow in this direction. With the attainment of freedom, now, fresh eff orts are being made to strengthen the panchayat system and make panchayats play a better part in the work of national reconstruction. Th e 73rd Amendment Act, 1993, has laid the foundation of strong and vibrant Panchayati Raj institutions in the country.

# **Modern Trends of Village System in India**

Change is the law of nature. It is the need of life. Change is but natural in human communities. Th e village community is also undergoing change, although the speed of change as compared with urban community is slow. Th e change in village community may be seen in diff erent spheres.

**(i) Caste system:** Th e British rule in India gave a serious blow to the caste system in the villages. Th e economic policy and the laws of British rules induced the diff erent castes to adopt occupations other than the traditional ones. Th e hold of caste panchayat was loosened. Th e status of a village man was determined on the basis of his economic position and personal attainments. Th e restrictions on food, dress, mode of living, and other matters imposed under caste system were removed. Even untouchability was weakened. Th us, the caste system has now lost its traditional hold in the villages; however, casteism is getting strengthened on account of political interests.

**(ii) Jajmani system:** Th e 'Jajmani' system, a feature of village community in India, has now weakened due to the governmental eff orts to raise the status of the lower castes and due to the impact of urbanization. Th e occupations adopted by the village people are not entirely hereditary or based on caste system, nor the payment for services rendered by the lower caste is in kind; it is now mostly cash payment.

**(iii) Family system:** Th e joint family system is no longer the peculiar characteristic of the village community. Nuclear families have taken its place. Th e family control over its members in matters of diet, dress, and marriage has weakened. Th e family is no longer an economic unit. Several activities which were once carried out within the family are now performed by outside agencies. Th e education of village girls has raised the status of rural women.

**(iv) Marriage system:** Change can also be seen in the institution of marriage. Although intercaste marriages are rare and parents continue to dominate the mate choice, the boys and girls are consulted by the parents in the matter of mate choice. Love marriages and divorces are almost non-existent. Th e individual qualities such as education, economic pursuit, beauty, and appearance of the marriage partners are given preference over the old family status. Th ere is now less expenditure on marriages. Th e marriage rites also have been minimized. Th e custom of child marriage is being abolished.

**(v) Living standards:** Th e standard of living in the village community is gradually going higher. Th e rural diet no more consists of coarse food only. It now includes vegetables, milk, bread, tea, and vegetable ghee. Th e dress is getting urbanized. Th e youths put on pants and the girls put on frocks and bell-bottoms. Even the old ladies put on blouses instead of shirts. Mill cloth is used in place of handloom cloth. Gold ornaments have replaced the old heavy silver ornaments. Th e young boys live bare-headed with well-combed long hair and the girls use cosmetics. Th ere are now 'pucca' houses to live. Th ese are now better ventilated, well furnished, and in some cases electrifi ed too. Ceiling fans can also be seen in some houses. Lanterns have replaced the earthen lamps in most houses. Gobar gas plants have been installed in some houses. Th e sanitary habits of the people have improved. Th ey now use soap for bathing and washing clothes. Safety razors are used for shaving. Th e drainage system is also much better. Primary health centres have made the villagers health conscious. Th e threat of epidemics has lessened due to vaccination and other preventive measures taken to the villages. Th e family planning programme has been understood by the village people who now adopt measures to limit the family size. Schools have been opened. In some villages degree and post-degree colleges can also be found. Agriculture institutes and other rural institutes have also been opened in some villages.

**(vi) Economic system:** Change has also taken place in the economic fi eld. Th e educated rural youth seeks jobs in the cities rather than settle on the land. Th e demand for new scientifi c instruments of agriculture is increasing. Th e farmers have been taught new methods to raise their production. Th e rural co-operative societies have lessened the woes and miseries of the village people in getting seeds, fertilizers, and credit. Th e 'Sahukara' system is on the wane. More and more banks are being opened in the villages. Th e Government gives fi nancial assistance and other facilities for setting up industries in villages. Th e per capita income has increased. Economic exploitation has decreased and the farmers get a good price for their products.

**(vii) Political system:** Th e setting up of 'panchayats' has led to the growth of political consciousness among the village people. Th e newspapers, radio, and television in some areas have added to the political knowledge of the villagers. However, political parties have divided the people into groups. Caste confl icts and group rivalries have increased. Th e community feeling has decreased. Selfi shness and individualism are growing.

It is thus evident that the Indian village is not a static community; it is dynamic. Sir Charles Metcalfe was wrong to hold that the village communities in India seem to last where nothing else lasts.

Th e villages in India are, at present, passing through a transitional period. From the sociological point of view the old social relations, bonds, and ties have disappeared. Community consciousness is steadily decreasing. Politics of the country has made deep inroads into the peaceful life of village people and has divided them into political and subcaste groups. Th e joint family system is fast disintegrating and morality has gone down. Th e only feature of the village community now left is agriculture.

# **Conclusion**

In India, the task of rural reconstruction is a big and complicated aff air not to be accomplished easily. As we have seen above, 75 per cent of population lives in villages. To raise the standard of living of 70 crore people is no easy talk. However, trends show that considerable progress is under way despite great diffi culties. A Ministry of Rural Development exists at the centre to look after the overall task of rural development and co-ordinate the diff erent schemes in this direction. Agricultural development along with irrigation and generation of electric power had the highest priority in the First Plan and were by and

large achieved. In the Second Plan, new targets of agricultural production were laid down which have been more than achieved. In the Th ird and Fourth Plans also, adequate importance was given to task of rural reconstruction. Th e successive plans also have given due attention to the programme of rural development. Various schemes such as Small Farmers Development Project (SFDP), Marginal Farmers and Agricultural Labourers Project (MFAL), Drought Prone Areas Programme (DP AP), Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP), Applied Nutrition Programme (ANP), and fi nally Jawahar Rozgar Yojna Programme have been in vogue for the upliftment of rural masses. Th e rural school is undergoing transformation. It is now better equipped and adequately staff ed. Th e introduction of labour-saving machinery has shortened farm hours, decreased the diffi culty of labour and increased the amount of leisure time. Link roads are being constructed in the villages, electricity is being provided, sanitary conditions have improved, health facilities are being provided, and well-equipped hospitals with qualifi ed doctors are being opened. Many of the conveniences and comforts of the city are being introduced into rural homes. Th e 73rd Amendment Act, 1993 has sought to make the Panchayati Raj System more eff ective in the fi eld of rural development. With the passing of the unattractive barren and drudgery features of village home, it is hoped, that there would come a new appreciation of the deeper rural values so that the young men would not fl ee to the cities, depriving the village of energetic and educated rural leadership.
