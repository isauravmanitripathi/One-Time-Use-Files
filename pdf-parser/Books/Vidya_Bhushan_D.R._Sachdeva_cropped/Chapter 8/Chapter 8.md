# **DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE**

Marriage is an institution that admits men and women to family life. It is a stable relationship in which a man and a woman are socially permitted to have children, implying the right to sexual relations. Edward Westermark defi ned marriage as the 'more or less durable connection between male and female, lasting beyond the mere act of propagation till after the birth of off spring'. Ernest R. Groves defi ned it as 'a public confession and legal registration of an adventure in fellowship'. Lowie defi ned it as a 'relatively permanent bond between permissible mates'. Malinowski defi ned marriage as 'a contract for the production and maintenance of children'. According to Lundberg, 'Marriage consists of the rules and regulations which defi ne the rights, duties and privileges of husband and wife, with respect to each other'. According to Horton and Hunt, 'Marriage is the approved social pattern whereby two or more persons establish a family'. H. T. Mazumdar defi nes marriage as 'a socially. sanctioned union of male and female, or as a secondary institution devised by society to sanction the union and mating of male and female, for purposes of (a) establishing a household, (b) entering into sex relations, to procreating, and (d) providing care for the off spring'. According to Anderson and Parker, 'Marriage is the sanctioning by a society of a durable bond between one or more males and one or more female established to permit sexual intercourse for the implied purpose of parenthood'. According to John Levy and Ruth Munroe, 'people get married because of the feeling that being in a family is the only proper, indeed the only possible, way to live. People do not marry because it is their social duty to perpetuate the institution of the family or because the scriptures recommend matrimony or because they have fallen in love with each other but because they lived in a family as children and cannot get over the feeling that being in family is the only proper way to live in society'. In almost all the societies, one or the other form of marriage exists.

# **FORMS OF MARRIAGE**

Th e main forms of marriage are as follows:

**(A) Polyandry:** One wife, many husbands. It is a form of marriage wherein one woman marries more than one man at a given time. It is thought to be widespread in Tibet where the conditions of social life are harsh, and where perhaps the eff orts of two or more men are needed to support a family. Th e Marquesans of Polynesia and the Todas of Malabar are also supposed to have this institution. From the Hindu mythology, we learn that the fi ve Pandava brothers shared one wife. Polyandry is also said to exist in some tribes as the Namib Bushmen, the Yaruro of Venezuela, the Lengua of EI Chaco, the Singhalese, the Mundas, and some ancient tribes of the Malay Peninsula.

Polyandry may take two forms:

**(1) Fraternal polyandry:** In this form of polyandry one wife, is regarded the wife of all brothers who have sexual relation with her. Th e children are treated as the off spring of the eldest brother.

**(2) Non-fraternal polyandry:** In this form one woman has many husbands with whom she cohabits in turn. It is not necessary that these husbands be brothers. If a child is born, then any one husband is chosen as the social parent by a special ritual.

Th e causes of polyandry are said to be the following:

 (i) Lesser number of women: According to Westermark, when the number of women is lesser than the number of males in a society, polyandry is found; for example, among the Todas of Nilgiri. But according to Briff ault, polyandry can exist even when the number of women is not less; for example, in Tibet, Sikkim, and Laddakh polyandry is found, although there is not much disparity in the number of men and women.

 (ii) Poverty: Polyandry has developed in such areas where there was scarcity of natural resources so that many men may support one woman and her children.

 (iii) Bride price: When in a society, bride price is high on account of the lesser number of women, polyandry develops.

 (iv) Population control: Polyandry has also been considered a means to check the growth of population in some societies.

 (v) Backwardness: Generally polyandry is found in the areas that are situated far away from the centres of culture and progress.

 (vi) Joint family: Th e spirit of joint family gets strengthened when several brothers marry the same woman.

Th e advantages of polyandry are as follows:

 (i) It controls the growth of population. (ii) Th e family property does not get divided. (iii) It strengthens the economic position of the family. (iv) It fosters community feeling among the members of the family. (v) Th e members feel security of life.

Its disadvantages are as follows:

 (i) It adversely aff ects the health of the woman because the same woman has to satisfy the sexual desires of several husbands.

 (ii) It leads to sterility. According to biologists, if the same woman cohabits several men, it may lead to sterility.

 (iii) It may diminish population. It is said that if polyandry continues in some tribal societies for another hundred years, it may lead to their extinction.

(iv) Divorce is easy in a polyandrous society.

 Polyandry is generally considered an obstacle in the way of social progress. It causes harm to married life and creates several other psychological problems. It is on this account that polyandry has gradually come to an end in those societies wherein it once prevailed.

**(B) Polygyny:** One husband many wives. Under this system one man has two or more wives at a time. In primitive times, it was quite prevalent among the Assyro-Babylonians and the Hebrews. In India, even today it exists among Muslims and also among Hindus. It is more frequent than polyandry. Polygyny is closely related to the institution of slavery. Generally, the women captured in war were made wives and concubines by the captor. Sometimes, a chieftain or Rajah may purchase women for wives. Th e Nawabs of Oudh in India, during Muslim times, were said to have a large number of wives, sometimes, the number reaching several hundred. Westermark has mentioned the following causes of polygyny:

 **(i) Enforced celibacy:** Men do not approach the women during the period of pregnancy and while the child is being breastfed. Due to this long period of enforced celibacy, a second marriage was contracted.

 **(ii) Earlier aging of the female:** In the uncivilized tribes, men remarried a number of times because the women aged earlier.

- **(iii) Variety:** Th e desire for variety is also the cause of polygyny.
- **(iv) More children:** Polygyny is also a practice to obtain more children.

 **(v) Social prestige:** In some tribes the leaders have more wives in order to prove their superiority. A single marriage is considered a sign of poverty.

 **(vi) Economic necessity:** In some areas polygyny is practised to get cheap and reliable labourers in the form of wives. In the Himalayan ranges, the men marry many times in order to protect their property and to obtain help in their agricultural activities. Polygyny lessens the cases of sexual infi delity, but it creates jealousy and hatred among the wives.

Th e advantages of polygyny are as follows:

 (i) It checks prostitution because man can satisfy his sex desire in a better way by keeping himself within the confi nes of marriage.

 (ii) It gives healthy children to the society because only rich people can aff ord to maintain several wives.

(iii) Children are better looked after because there are several women to look after them.

Its disadvantages are as follows:

 (i) It increases economic burden on the head of the family because he has to support many women and children.

- (ii) Th e children cannot be looked after properly because too many of them are to be looked after.
- (iii) It creates jealousy among the wives and their children.
- (iv) It destroys family happiness.
- (v) Th e women possess lower positions.

# **114** Chapter 8

 On account of its greater harmful eff ects on family life, polygyny has been declared illegal in the civilized societies. Th e Indian Government has declared polygyny an off ence under Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Public opinion also is generally against the system.

**(C) Monogamy**: One man one wife. Under monogamy one man marries one woman at a time. Th is is the leading form of marriage. Its advantages are now well recognized. It produces the highest types of aff ection and sincere devotion. Th e children are well looked after. Both father and mother give earnest attention to the upbringing of their off spring. Although monogamy is said to cause extramarital relations and exploitation of women, according to Malinowski, 'Monogamy is, has been, and will remain the only true type of marriage'. It is probably on account of great advantages of monogamy that the public offi cers in India have been legally forbidden to practise polygyny.

**(D) Companionate marriage:** Th is is 'the marriage of two persons on the understanding that as long as there are no children the marriage may be dissolved simply by mutual consent'. Judge Ben B. Lindsey was of the opinion that this system is much better than free love or trial marriage because the knowledge that in case there are no children divorce may be obtained will provide wholesome attitudes toward marriage. Th e opponents of the system, however, point out that it leads to quick-married and quick-divorced trends and makes it easy for persons to marry on the basis of sex alone.

**(E) Experimental marriage:** Some thinkers have proposed experimental marriages to fi nd out the compatibility of the two people before they settle down to a life of permanent union. A man and woman may be allowed to lead marital life temporarily in order to fi nd out if they can settle down permanently in matrimonial relations. Th is approach would lessen the chances of divorce at a later stage. During the period of experiment they would become acquainted with each other and come to know each other's personality intimately. If they fi nd that they have compatible personality, they may enter into permanent marriage relations; otherwise depart from each other. Th ere may be something to be said in favour of experimental marriages, but the experimental approach is fi ne in the laboratory, and not in marriage. Here it may also be mentioned that many societies permit extramarital or premarital sexual relations. In our society, the attitude towards sexual relations is extremely restrictive. We think that the sexual relations should be confi ned to marriage and that a person should have only one marriage partner at a time. But this rule is broken as well. It is found that percentage of men having premarital intercourse is higher than that of the women. In the West, the proportion of men and women having premarital intercourse is higher than that in India.

# **Other Forms of Marriage**

In connection with marriage there are certain terms that need explanation. One is *sororal polygyny*  which means the marriage of a man with several sisters. *Levirate,* another term, is the marriage of a man with the childless widow of his deceased brother. *Sororate* a third term, means the marriage of a man with the sister of his deceased wife, especially if she has left no off spring. *Concubinage* is a state of living together as husband and wife without being married, it is cohabitation with one or more women who are distinct from wife or wives. Concubinage is sometimes recognized by various societies as an accepted institution. *Hypergamy* means the marriage of the daughter in the superior and noble family. It is highly practised in India. If the parents give their daughters in a low family it is regarded a blot upon their family. *Anuloma* marriage is a form of intercaste marriage wherein men of higher caste wed women of lower caste. *Protiloma* marriage is also a form of intercaste marriage in which men of lower caste marry women of superior castes.

# **MATE CHOICE**

Marriage is a very important social institution. No society allows a couple to quietly pair off and start living as husband and wife. Every society has developed a pattern for guiding marriages. Before marriage is solemnized, the fi rst and most important task is the choice of mates. Th e question of proper choice of mates is so important that a wrong choice may for ever doom the family to unhappiness. Selection of partners is entirely an individual aff air. Although no standards of choice are laid down by the community , from time to time certain rules have been made to regulate the selection of mates.

# **Exogamy**

Exogamy means marriage outside the group. Generally, people prohibit marriage between individuals sharing certain degrees of blood or affi nal relationships. A man must not only seek a wife out of his own clan but also must avoid the clans of all the grandparents. Th en there are certain relations that are not to be married, but the degree of nearness diff ers from community to community.

Th e following forms of exogamy are found in India:

**(i) Gotra exogamy:** Among the Hindus, the prevailing practice is to marry outside the 'gotra'. People of the same 'gotra' are believed to have similar blood and so their inter-marriage is prohibited.

**(ii) Village exogamy:** Among many Indian tribes, there is the practice to marry outside the village.

# **Endogamy**

Marriage within the class is known as endogamy. Hence, marriages with out-group members are prohibited. Even today intercaste marriages are not encouraged. Hitler had declared an Aryan-Jewish marriage a criminal act. In India, a Brahmin can marry only a Brahmin and that too of his/her own sub-caste. A marriage of a Vaishya with a Brahmin is not socially approved. In the old polynesian society, marriages between nobles and commoners were severely deprecated. Even today, a labourer cannot marry the daughter of a big industrialist. In India, endogamy is mostly obligatory. However, today endogamous attitudes have somewhat relaxed and softened and we sometimes hear of an intercaste marriages, but that is not common as yet.

In India, we fi nd the following forms of endogamy:

- **(i) Tribal endogamy:** No one can marry outside his own tribe.
- **(ii) Caste endogamy:** Marriage should take place within the caste.
- **(iii) Class endogamy:** Marriage is contracted between people of one class or of a particular status.
- **(iv) Sub-caste endogamy:** Choice for marriage is restricted to the sub-caste.

# **116** Chapter 8

**(v) Race endogamy:** People can marry within the race.

By preventing marriage outside the group, endogamy (i) preserves the group's homogeneity, (ii) protects its prestige and status, (iii) maintains the numerical force of its group, (iv) preserves the purity in the group, (v) keeps women happier, (vi) fosters the sense of unity within the group, (vii) keeps property within the group.

However, endogamy has some disadvantages.

**(i)** It limits the sphere of mate selection.

**(ii)** It lays emphasis on group feeling, which creates communalism and checks the growth of national unity.

**(iii)** Encourages casteism.

**(iv)** Encourages hatred and jealousy among diff erent groups.

**(v)** Encourages dowry and bride price.

### **Selection by Parents**

Th e selection of mates in the East is generally made by parents or elders. It is considered that they being experienced can better evaluate the merits of prospective partners. Young boys and girls are not that experienced and are led more by transitory rather than permanent valuable considerations. In the West, the usual procedure of choosing mates is that of 'falling in love', which does not give consideration to sound principles of eugenics. As Bogardus observes, 'Love, often is a tumultuous god who takes delight in freak matings'.

It is contended that parents, in making the selection of mates, are often moved by their own caprices and personal desires and neglect the wishes of the mates to be married. Th ey force their children to marry someone whom they do not like. Th is contention is not futile. It has come to light that sometimes parents marry their son or daughter to one who is not a suitable match on biological or psychological grounds, but whose status and wealth would add greatly to their prestige. It is, therefore, desirable that parents before contracting a marriage should consult their children's wishes, make known the reasons of the choice, and secure their approval by making appeal to their mind and not by exercising threat.
