# **3 Institutions**

### **MEANING OF INSTITUTION**

In ordinary speech or writing, people often use the word institution to mean an organization with some specifi c purpose, as a public or charitable institution. Sometimes it is used to denote any set of people in organized interaction; for example, family or club or government. For the purpose of sociology a more precise defi nition is required.

Institutions have been defi ned by McIver as the 'established forms or conditions of procedure characteristic of a group activity'.

According to Horton and Hunt, 'An institution is an organised system of relationships which embodies certain common rules and procedures and meets certain basic needs of the society'.

According to Bogardus, 'A social institution is a structure of society that is organised to meet the needs of people chiefl y through well-established procedures'.

According to Cooley, 'An institution is a complete organisation of collective behaviour established in the social heritage and meeting some persistent need or want'.

H. E. Barnes holds that 'Social institutions are the social structures and machinery through which human society organises, directs and executes the multifarious activities required for human need'.

Institutions are forms of procedure. Every organization is dependent upon certain recognized and established set of rules, traditions, and usages. Th ese usages and rules may be given the name of institutions. Th ey are the forms of procedures that are recognized and accepted by the society and govern the relations between individuals and groups. Th us, marriage, education, property, and religion are the main institutions.

#### **56** Chapter 3

Th e following characteristics may be noted in the concept of an institution.

- **(i)** Institutions are the means of controlling individuals.
- **(ii)** Institutions depend on the collective activities of men.
- **(iii)** Th e institution has some proceedings that are formed on the basis of customs and dogmas.
- **(iv)** Institution is more stable than other means of social control.
- **(v)** Every institution has some rules that must be compulsorily obeyed by the individuals.
- **(vi)** Institutions are formed to satisfy the primary needs of men. It has social recognition behind it.

# **Diff erence Between Institution and Association**

**(i)** Association represents human aspect. If institutions, as discussed above, are the rules of procedure, it obviously follows that they cannot be identifi ed with associations. Association is a group of persons organized for the pursuit of a specifi c purpose. A family is an association which is organized for the purpose of propagation of mankind, whereas marriage is its main institution. Likewise, the party system is an institution, but the state is an association; baptism is an institution, but the church is an association. An association represents human aspect, whereas an institution is a social condition of conduct and behaviour. Institutions are the way of attaining the object or objects for which the association exists. A college is an association with the specifi c purpose of imparting education; lectures and examination system are institutions.

**(ii)** Associations have form and are concrete, whereas institutions have no form and are abstract.

**(iii)** Associations are things, whereas institutions are modes. Th e distinction between associations and institutions is of great importance in sociology because it is mainly concerned with institutions rather than with associations. Institutions give life and activity to association, communities, or any other types of societies. We are born and live in associations.

It may be noted that while association and institution are diff erent concepts, no institution can function without an association.

**A case of both an association and institution:** Sometimes the same thing is termed as both the institution and association; for example, a hospital or a college. But as MacIver observes, 'If we *are considering something* as *an organised group, it is an association;* if as a form of procedure, it is an institution. Association denotes membership, institution denotes a mode or means of service. When we regard a college as a body of teachers and students, we are selecting its associational aspect, but when we regard it as an educational system, we are selecting its institutional features'.

# **Diff erence Between Institution and Society**

Th e following points of diff erence between institution and society may be noted:

**(i)** Society is a system of social relationships, whereas institution is the organization of rules, traditions, and usages.

- **(ii)** Institutions are the forms of procedure that are recognized and accepted by the society.
- **(iii)** Institutions exist for the society and govern the relations between members of the society.

**(iv)** Society represents human aspects, whereas an institution is a social condition of conduct and behaviour.

#### **Diff erence Between Institution and Community**

Th e points of diff erence between an institution and a community are as follows:

**(i)** Institution is an organization of rules, traditions, and usages, whereas community is a group of people.

**(ii)** Institution is a structure of society to fulfi l some specifi c needs, whereas community is a group of people living in a particular locality and possessing community sentiment.

**(iii)** Institution is abstract, whereas community is concrete.

**(iv)** Individuals are the members of community and not of the institution.

**(v)** Every institution is concerned with one particular aspect of life, whereas community is concerned with the social life as a whole.

**(vi)** Institution is based on the collective activities of human beings, whereas community is based on mutual relationships.

**(vii)** Institutions are born in a community, whereas a community grows itself.

### **IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTION**

Professor Bronislaw Malinowski has described the importance of institutions in these words, 'Every institution centres around a fundamental need, permanently unites a group of people in a co-operational task and has its particular body of doctrines and its technique or craft. Institutions are not correlated simply and directly to new functions, one need does not receive one's satisfaction in one institution'. Societies must reproduce new members, socialize them, give them a sense of purpose, and provide for the maintenance of order and the production and distribution of goods and services. Each of these functions is performed through some social structure such as family, school, state, church, or business enterprise. Institutions, as defi ned earlier, are the sanctioned rules and procedures to control the activities of social structures. Th us, marriage controls the family, education controls the school, political system controls the state, baptism controls the church, and the economic system controls the business enterprise. Institution is a social condition of conduct and behaviour.

Writing about the importance of institutions, MacIver says, 'It transfers cultural elements from one generation to another, introduces unity in human behaviour, controls their conduct and guides man according to circumstances'. Institutions simplify the group or social acts of an individual. Th ey provide a defi nite role and status to the individual. Th e parents learn their place and a child learns his duties towards the parents or elders in the society through institutions. As a matter of fact, institutions maintain unity and harmony in the society. Th ey provide a unifi ed pattern of diverse ways of human behaviour and action.

It may not, however, be construed that institutions do not create some evils. Th ey generally create hurdles in the smooth growth of society; for example, caste system has created unbreakable social divisions. Religion has led to communalism. Marx called it 'the opium of the masses' which keeps them in an abject degradation. India was partitioned in the name of religion. However, it is diffi cult to see how any society can keep united without the aid of institutions.

### **KINDS OF INSTITUTIONS**

Th ere are fi ve kinds of institutions.

- **(i)** Family
- **(ii)** Economics
- **(iii)** Religion
- **(iv)** Education
- **(v)** State

Th ere are a number of secondary institutions derived from each of the fi ve primary institutions. Th us, the secondary institutions derived from family would be the marriage, divorce, monogamy, polygamy, etc. Th e secondary institutions of economics are property, trading, credit, banking, etc. Th e secondary institutions of religion are church, temple, mosque, totem, taboo, etc. Th e secondary institutions of education are school, college, university, etc. Th e secondary institutions of state are interest groups, party system, democracy, etc. Institutions may grow as do the folkways and mores or they may be created just as laws are enacted; for instance, monogamy or polyandry grew in response to the needs of the people. Banks grew as the need for borrowing and lending money was felt. Schools and colleges are created by deliberate choice and action. An important feature that we fi nd in the growth of institutions is the extension of the power of the state over the other four primary institutions. Th e state now exercises more authority by laws and regulations. Sometimes, folkways and mores are incorporated into laws; for example, monogamy. Sometimes, new laws may be enacted; for example, Hindu Code Bill. Today, the family is being regulated and controlled by the state in scores of ways. A number of traditional functions of family have been taken over by the state. Th e state has enacted laws regulating marriage, divorce, adoption, and inheritance. Th e authority of state has similarly been extended to economics, to education, and to religion.

An institution never dies. New institutional norms may replace the old norms, but the institution goes on. For example, the modern family has replaced the norms of patriarchal family, yet family as an institution continues. When feudalism died, government did not end. Th e governmental and economic functions continued to be fulfi lled, although according to the changed norms. All the primary institutions are thousands of years old, only the institutional norms are new.

### **FUNCTIONS OF INSTITUTIONS**

Th e functions of institutions are of two kinds:

- **(i)** Manifest
- **(ii)** Latent

Manifest functions are those functions that are intended and main functions, that is, those functions for which the institution primarily exists. Latent functions are unintended functions. Th ey are not primary functions, but only the by-products. Th us, the manifest functions of education are the development of literacy, training for occupational roles, and the inculcation of basic social values. But its latent functions would be keeping youth off the labour market, weakening the control of parents or devel opment of friendship. Th e manifest functions of religion are worship of God and instruction in religious ideology. Its latent functions would be to develop attachment to one's religious community, to alter family life and to create religious hatred. Th e manifest function of economic institutions is to produce and distribute goods, whereas its latent functions may be to promote urbanization, promote the growth of labour unions, and redirect education. Th e latent functions of an institution may support the intended objectives, or may damage the norms of the institution.

### **INTERRELATIONS OF INSTITUTIONS**

A social structure owes its stability to a proper adjustment of relationships among the diff erent institutions. No institution works in a vacuum. Religion, education, family, government, and business all interact with one another. Th us, education creates attitudes which infl uence the acceptance or rejection of religious dogmas. Religion may exalt education because it enables one to know the truths of God or denounce it because it threatens the faith. Business conditions may infl uence the family life. Unemployment may determine the number of people who feel unable to marry. An unemployed person may postpone his marriage till he gets employed in a suitable job. Postponement of marriage may aff ect the birth rates. Th e state infl uences the functions of institutions. It may take over some of the functions and determine their institutional norms. Th e businessmen, educators, clergymen, and the functionaries of all other institutions also seek to infl uence acts of state, since any state action may obstruct or help the realization of their institutional objectives. Th us, social institutions are closely related with one another.

Th e interrelationships of the various institutions can be likened to a wheel. Th e family is the hub, whereas education, religion, government, and economics are the spokes of the wheel. Th e rim would be the community within which the various institutions operate.

All institutions face the problem of continuously adjusting themselves to a changing society. Changes in the social environment may bring changes in all the institutions. Infl ation may have a great infl uence on marriage, death, crime, and education. Breakdown of economic institutions may have radical eff ects on political institutions. Any change in an institution may lead to a change in the other institutions. Th ere may also take place a shifting of functions from one institution to another. Child care, formerly a function of family, has now shifted to the state. When one institution fails to meet a human need, another institution will often assume the function. No institution can avoid aff ecting other institutions or avoid being aff ected by others.
