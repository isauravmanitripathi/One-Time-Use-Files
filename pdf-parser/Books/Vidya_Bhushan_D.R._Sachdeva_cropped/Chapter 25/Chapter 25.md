# Unit 10 The Role of Social Legislations Towards Social Change in India

# **25 Social Problems in India**

Every society has one or the other social problem and it would endeavour to solve the same. A social problem is a situation or condition which is regarded by society as a threat to its established ways or its well-being and therefore needs to be eliminated or alleviated.

Whether a particular situation is a problem is largely a matter of subjective judgement. One society may regard a situation as a problem, while another may not. In the same society, what is regarded a problem today may not be regarded the problem tomorrow because of change in conditions and attitudes. In ancient India, the caste system was no problem. Th e several castes accepted their hereditary status as fi xed from the beginning, and their religion sanctioned their acceptance of heredity. Slavery in America would have never become a social problem if it had not been challenged.

It may also be noted that a situation becomes a problem only when the people become aware that certain cherished values are threatened by conditions which have become acute. Untouchability became a social problem in India only when people realized that it constitutes a threat to the social unity and something should be done to abolish it.

Th ere are some social problems which are universal and permanent. War, crime, unemployment, and poverty have always been regarded as major social problems in all societies and in all times. We have discussed some social problems in the previous chapters, dealing with family, education, religion, and other institutions of social life. Among the various social problems being faced in our country, we shall focus on only a few of them. Th ey are poverty, unemployment, and dowry.

#### **POVERTY**

Poverty is one of the foremost social problems facing India and other countries. According to John L. Gillin, poverty may be regarded as 'that condition in which a person either because of inadequate income or unwise expenditures, does not maintain a scale of living high enough to provide for his physical and mental effi ciency and to enable him and his natural dependents to function usually according to the standards of society of which he is a member'. Poverty exists when one is not able to get suffi cient food and necessities of life. According to J. G. Goddard, 'poverty is the insuffi cient supply of those things which are requisite for an individual to maintain himself and those dependent upon him in health and vigour'. Th e rich and the poor have always existed in society, but historically the existence of poverty did not constitute an important social problem until the exchange system and a scale of values came into existence. When trade expanded, some people began to amass wealth, leading to its uneven distribution. Th ey started living a luxurious life, depriving others of comforts. Th e members of society began to compare the diff erences in the economic status and look upon themselves as either poor or rich in accordance with the prevailing living standards. So, poverty is considered a problem only when obvious diff erences in economic status among members of a society are established and comparisons and evaluations of those diff erences are made. In the absence of these diff erences, poverty does not exist, even though life may be most precarious. Th us, poverty was no problem in the middle age, even though by modern standards the level of living at that time was incredibly low—poverty was simply accepted as inevitable. Poverty is relative to richness. It is only when people feel resentment at their lot as compared with that of others that they feel the sting of poverty. In case of extreme privation too, they may feel this sting without comparing their lot with that of others. Th ey fail to achieve more than what they have, and the awareness of this failure causes resentment of poverty among them. Th erefore, it is the attitude of resentment which brings the problem of poverty to the forefront. Th e primitive people lived a more precarious life, but they considered their discomfort as a natural condition, rather than as a problem calling for solution, and hence accepted it without being resentful. People are poor not because of an increase in misery but because of the attitude of resentment at what they do not possess and what others possess. Th ey regard themselves as poor when they feel deprived of what others possess and enjoy. It is then that poverty becomes a social problem.

#### **No Uniform Standards**

Th e standards of poverty judgement are not uniform throughout. According to Adam Smith, 'man is rich or poor according to the degree in which he can aff ord to enjoy the necessaries, the conveniences and the amusements of life'. In the western societies, people are not poor because they lack the necessities of life, such as food, clothing, and shelter, but only because their possessions are considered insuffi cient according to the prevailing standards. Th us, the inability to own a radio, a computer, or an automobile may be and often is taken as an indication of poverty. In India, on the other hand, deprivation of the necessities of life constitutes poverty. Th e possession of radio, TV, or automobile is a sign of richness. A vast majority of India's population lives below the subsistence level. Many do not get two meals a day; they spend their nights on pavements and live half-clothed.

How poor we are! In India, poverty is a foremost social problem. Nothing to speak of comforts, the here people are deprived even of the basic necessities of life. According to the United Nations Human Development Report of 1990, 48 per cent of the country's population lived below the poverty line, though as per Planning Commission, 29.9 per cent of the population was below the poverty line. (According to the Economic Survey 2001–2004, it had declined to 26 per cent in 1999–2000.) Th e poverty line is drawn at ` 49.9 per capita per month (1973–1975 prices) in the rural area and an income of ` 56.44 per capita per month in the urban area. In the United Sates of America, the average income is ` 9196, in the United Kingdom ` 3858, and in Australia it is ` 4207. Th us, an American earns thirty-three times more than an Indian. Each year India adds about 5 million people to the growing multitude of poor. Poverty is more pronounced among the lower classes and in the rural areas. At present 1.6 million Americans are living below the poverty line as per the Census Bureau's annual report. A family of four with two children was considered to be living in poverty with an income of US\$18,244 in 2002–2003.

# **Causes of Poverty**

What are the causes of poverty? According to Henry George, the main cause of poverty is the personal ownership and monopoly of the individual on the land. He writes, 'In the great cities, where land is so valuable that it is measured by the foot, you will fi nd the extremes of poverty and of luxury. And this disparity in condition between the two extremes of the social scale may always be measured by the price of land'. According to Marx, the main cause of poverty is the exploitation of the workers by the capitalists. According to Malthus, increasing population is the cause of poverty. Th ese thinkers however laid emphasis on one particular cause of poverty. As a matter of fact the causes of poverty are numerous and complex. Some of the causes are personal, while others are geographical, economic, and social. It is the task of an economist to analyse them in detail. We shall not make any attempt to analyse them. Th e Gillins listed three factors as primarily responsible for poverty:

**(i)** Incapacity of the individual, which may be due to a faulty heredity or to the environment

**(ii)** Unfavourable physical conditions, such as poor natural resources, bad climate and weather, natural calamities, fl oods, earthquakes and epidemics

**(iii)** Maldistribution of wealth and income and the imperfect functioning of our economic institutions

Of these three factors, the last two factors are principally responsible for poverty in India. Ours is a country rich in natural resources, but we have not yet adequately exploited them. A vast area of land remains uncultivated. Our means of cultivation are old styled, resulting in less production. Industries are not well-developed, and a vast portion of population depends on agriculture. In addition to it, wealth is unevenly distributed due to bad economic planning which even leads to wastage.

A lot of the poor people cannot improve except through economic development. Th ere is imperative need for drastic economic reforms. Th e progress we have made has fallen short of our plan targets. Th e maladies are many. Th e over-bureaucratization, excessive control over industrial sector, and undue importance given to public sector without ensuring its profi tability, and now the lack of fi rm political leadership due to a fractured mandate have pushed the country back compared to many emerging nations.

# **UNEMPLOYMENT**

Closely associated with the problem of poverty is the problem of unemployment because when people remain idle they become poor. If there are needs to be satisfi ed, then people must be employed to satisfy them. Unemployment not only leads to suff ering and privation but also adversely aff ects the

social organization which is the main interest of sociologists. Defi ning unemployment, Karl Pribram has written, 'Unemployment is a condition of the labour market in which the supply of labour is greater than the number of available openings'. According to Fairchild, 'unemployment is forced and involuntary separation from remunerative work or the part of the normal working force during normal working time, at normal wages and under normal conditions'.

According to Chapman, unemployment is of two kinds:

- **(i)** Subjective unemployment
- **(ii)** Objective unemployment

Subjective unemployment is caused by physical and mental diseases of the individual. Objective unemployment is of four types:

- **(i)** Seasonal unemployment
- **(ii)** Cyclical unemployment
- **(iii)** Structural unemployment
- **(iv)** Normal unemployment

In addition to these forms of unemployment, there may also be agricultural unemployment, technological unemployment, and educational unemployment.

Although unemployment is universal, in India it is more marked. Th e number of total unemployed youths with at least matriculation qualifi cation is put about at 5 million. Th is includes about 1.5 million unemployed graduates. A study undertaken by the Manpower Division of the Directorate of Employment Exchange, Ministry of Labour and Employment of the pattern of unemployment among graduates showed that about 93 per cent of the unemployed graduates seeking employment were men and about 7 per cent women. About 48.5 per cent of the unemployed graduates were BA's, 22.7 per cent BSc's, and 12.8 per cent BCom's. Unemployment is also widespread among the professionally trained people such as engineers, doctors, and other technically qualifi ed people. No reliable fi gures are available about unemployment among the illiterate people—those who earn their bread through daily wages. Th e statistics maintained by the employment exchanges do not give any exact idea of the level of unemployment because (i) the employment exchanges mainly cover urban areas, (ii) all the unemployed people do not get themselves registered, and (iii) some of the registrants are already employed and seek better jobs.

#### **Causes of Unemployment**

Economists have explained the causes of unemployment and its cumulative tendencies. Th ey have distinguished between the 'frictional' unemployment due to a changeover from one job to another and the immobility of those who do not feel inclined to move away to a strange district to fi nd work on the one hand and unemployment due to more profound economic dislocation on the other. New inventions take jobs away from people before new jobs are created. Also, much unemployment is caused by business depressions which arise because production moves faster than purchasing power. Unemployment then represents changes in business conditions which come more quickly than changes in population.

In India, the problem of unemployment among the educated youth is assuming serious proportions. As discussed earlier, the faulty system of our education has been responsible for it. We are  admitting thousands of young boys and girls to the institutions of higher learning without any prospects of employment for them. Even the technical people such as engineers, doctors, and those trained in specialized jobs are without employment. Unemployment is a great cause of social disorganization. Th e crisis in the Indian society today is largely a crisis of fi nding suitable jobs for the millions who join institutions aimlessly and come out of them only to suff er frustration outside and become deviant. Unless and until employment opportunities increase fast enough, poverty cannot be removed.

Th e number of unemployed in the country had increased to 26.58 million in 1999–2000 from 20.13 million in 1993–1994. Th eir number is increasing every year because the government has banned the recruitments on the plea that it suff ers from fi nancial crunch. Th e colleges and universities and technical institutions including those of computers and information technology are turning out millions of graduates, but they have little prospects of employment. Th e former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had declared that one crore jobs should be created every year, which remained only an announcement. Unemployment is a serious problem, and if it is not tackled, it will cause havoc of the worst type.

# **DOWRY**

Th e practice of dowry has been prevalent in our country since ancient times.

Th e Committee on the Status of Women defi ned dowry as what is given to the bride, and often settled beforehand and announced openly or discreetly. Th e settlement often includes the enormous expenses incurred on travel and entertainment of the bridegroom's party.

According to the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, dowry has been defi ned as follows: Any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly (a) by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage; or (b) by the parents or either party to the marriage or by any other person, to either party to the marriage or any other person; at or before or after the marriage as consideration for the marriage of the aforesaid parties; but does not include dowry or mehr in the case of persons to whom the Muslim personal law (shariat) applies (Section 2).

Following the above defi nition, the constituents of 'dowry' are as follows:

**(i)** Giving or taking some property or valuable security by one party to the marriage to the other party

**(ii)** Giving or taking the property by the parents of either party

**(iii)** Giving or taking property, in respect of any marriage from either party to marriage by any other person

**(iv)** Giving any property or valuable security not only at the time of marriage but also before or after the marriage has been celebrated

It is interesting to note that Haryana Dowry Prohibition Act has included the following in dowry, besides the property or valuable security marriage expenses incurred during ceremonies connected with marriage; Th akka, Sagai, Tikka Shagan, and Milni; illuminations, gifts to either party in the form of cash, ornaments, clothes, or other articles, expenses on arrangements for food and other incidentals.

# **Evolution of the System**

Th e system of dowry prevalent in India is not of a recent origin. Th is social evil has plagued the society since ancient times.

Ancient scriptures approved of wealth given to a bride at the time of her wedding. It was her parent's gift of love to ensure that she was provided with fi nancial security when she left her parental home. Th eoretically, she was free to do what she wanted with her wealth but in practice the actual control shifted to her husband and his family. Slowly this wealth given to a woman for her personal security and enjoyment turned into an instrument of her exploitation.

Th e amount of dowry is generally regulated by the social and economic status of the bridegroom's father, the social prestige of his family, and the educational qualifi cations of the bridegroom and is based on the expectation in life of the bridegroom. If he is highly settled in life, the demand on his behalf, made by his parents, is greater.

Th e main reasons for the giving dowry are the following:

**(i)** It has become a matter of status or prestige.

- **(ii)** It has been recognized as a religious system.
- **(iii)** People belief that a good dowry hoops a good 'catch'.

**(iv)** Parents desire to see that their daughter is well settled in life and gets due aff ection from her in-laws.

#### **Dowry and Methods of Extraction**

Devious methods are used for extracting dowries from girl's parents. For instance, the boy's parents may try to show that their families are used to live a high standard of living and therefore want girls whose parents are prepared to set themselves and their sons up in the standard they are all used. Or they would advertise for a convent educated and a working girl for their son, who may prove a hen giving golden eggs throughout the life. Accordingly, their choice of girls may be set:

**1.** Working girls would be just fi ne, for she shall be a 'feather' in the family's cap.

**2.** If the girl's family is 'well connected and highly placed', this would be a continuing source of strength in the uncertainties of modern living. Further, an ideal connection would pour into the receiving family an unending fl ow of modern luxuries, depending on how high up the social ladder they aspire to ascend.

#### **Evils of Dowry System**

Th e parents have to work hard to provide their prospective son-in-law with good dowries, otherwise the girl would not ever get married. Before the marriage is fi nalized, the groom's parents demand large sums of money in hard cash besides the demand for cars, scooters, fridge, radio, stereos, sophisticated furniture, pedestal fans, electrical household gadgets, wedding suits for the groom of best quality, requisite number of saris for the female relatives of the groom, trinkets of gold and silver, huge party at one of the biggest hotels of the city, and travelling expenses. Such huge is the demand that many a father can ill aff ord to meet. Th e result is that the girl should either remain spinster or earn money for her dowry by working in some gainful employment.

Th e dowry system is a pernicious evil. It has drawn many girls to suicide, to save their parents from economic drudgery. Many are duped into the brothels or service of doubtful nature or resort to prostitution.

If, however, marriage is solemnized with certain higgling and bargaining, the matter does not end there. Soon after the marriage, the torture of the girl begins at the hands of the husband in connivance with her in-laws. Th e torture may involve the use of brutal methods like beating severely, throwing out of the house, denying food for days together, and giving all sorts of mental tortures, such as accusation, taunts, abusing, and even burning to death.

Hardly a day passes, when suicide or murder news for dowry are not fl ashed in the dailies in some or the other part of the country. Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat, and Rajasthan are often in the news for this heinous crime.

Th e dowry system has reduced a father to penury and driven many a desperate girl to suicide as a relief from ignominious virginity. Instances could be given of scores of strong, intelligent, and remarkable boys chained to ugly and totally unfi t girls because the latter brought with them fat dowries and the boys' parents had their eyes on nothing else. And equally common are cases of lovely and bright girls mated with the very drags of society because their parents are poor.

#### **Eff orts at Regulating the System**

With the advent of the British and the impact of the western thought, Indian scholars and reformers began to bring about reforms in social values. Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Keshab Chandra Sen, Pandita Ramabai, Jyotiba Phule, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Mahatma Gandhi had condemned the dowry system.

Mahatma Gandhi said, 'Any young man who makes dowry a condition for marriage discredits his education and his country and dishonours womanhood. Young men who soil their fi ngers with such ill-gotten gold should be excommunicated from society'.

Jawahar Lal Nehru had appealed to the college girls: 'Our marriage laws and many of our out-ofdate customs which hold us back and specially crush our women folk—will you not combat them and bring them in line with modern condition? ... I charge you to keep that torch of freedom burning brightly till it spreads its lustre all over this ancient and dearly loved land of ours'.

#### **Dowry Regulation Prohibition Acts**

Dowry has been regarded as one of the greatest social evils. Hence, legislative measures were taken by the state governments from time to time such as the Andhra Pradesh Dowry Prohibition Act, passed in 1958, and the Bihar Dowry Restraint Act, in 1958. Th ese enactments have been repealed by the Dowry Prohibition Act 1961, passed by the Central Government, which made the giving or taking of dowry an off ence. Other enactments are the Jammu and Kashmir Dowry Prohibition Act, 1960, the West Bengal Act of 1975, the Punjab Act of 1976, the Himachal Pradesh Act of 1976; the Haryana Act of 1976, and the Orissa Act of 1976.

Th e Dowry Prohibition Act was enacted in 1961 with a view to 'do away with the practice of giving or taking dowry and to make such practice an off ence'.

Under the Act (Section 6), the interests of the wife are protected by providing the following:

**(a)** Th e dowry received by any person shall be transferred to the bride.

**(b)** If the dowry was received before the marriage, it shall be transferred to the woman within one year after the date of marriage.

**(c)** If the dowry was received when the wife was a minor, then the dowry should be transferred soon after she attains the age 18 years.

If any person fails to transfer any property that he has received by way of dowry, he shall be punishable with imprisonment which may extend to six months or with fi ne which may extend to fi ve thousand rupees or both.

Further, if the woman, who is entitled to any property, dies before receiving it, the heirs of the woman shall be entitled to claim it from the person holding it.

Th e Act provides that a court inferior to that of a presidency magistrate or magistrate of fi rst class cannot try an off ence. Further, no court can take cognizance of any off ence under the Act unless a complaint is made. Such a complaint has to be made to the court within one year from the date of the off ence.

All off ences under the Act are declared to be non-cognizable, available and non-compoundable.

# **Other Suggestions for Combating the Evil of Dowry**

Th e evil of dowry can be mitigated by taking the following steps in addition to the strict implementation of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961:

**(i)** Th ere should be expeditious disposal of dowry cases and the award of exemplary punishments to the participants of the crime of committing atrocities on the brides for bringing in more dowry.

**(ii)** Ms Nisha Sharma of Delhi had shown appreciable courage in getting her would-be husband arrested by the police by informing that her would-be in-laws were not satisfi ed with the double set of cars, TVs, refrigerators, etc., and were demanding ` 50 lakh in cash. Th is heroic role of her was appreciated not only in India but also in other countries. Th e young brides should follow her example and refuse to the demands of the greedy people.

**(iii)** Young boys and girls should start a campaign against dowry and plead that they will never like their parents to ask for dowry.

**(iv)** Voluntary organizations should highlight the evils of dowry causing immense amount of mental torture to the parents of the bride. Th e slogan 'dulhan hi dahej hai' (bride is the dowry) should be propagated vigorously, and the people asking for dowry should be socially boycotted.

**(v)** A popular movement against dowry should be supported by our political and religious leaders and the incalculable harm of this practice should be brought home to all the sections of community.

**(vi)** Simple, inexpensive marriages should be encouraged so that enormous expenses incurred as a part of dowry are avoided. Th e intrinsic qualities of the partners should be the deciding factor between the would-be wife and husband, not the material gains that should accrue from their entering into wedlock.

Hopefully, the evil of dowry will disappear if the above suggestions are seriously implemented and the rich people and political leaders set an example in that direction by avoiding ostentatious marriage for their sons and daughters.

# **POPULATION GROWTH**

India is the world's second most populous country, the fi rst place being held by China. According to the 2001 census, India's population was 102,70,15,247 (i.e., one hundred two crore seventy lakh fi fteen thousand two hundred forty-seven)—an increase of 21.34 per cent over the 1991 population of 84.39 crore. According to projections made in a World Bank report, India's estimated population by 2150 will be over 1756 million against China's 1686 million. India will thereby overtake China and become the most populous country of the world.

# **Causes of Population Growth in India**

Th e three factors infl uencing population growth are fertility, mortality, and migration. All these three factors are socially determined and socially determining. Society is both a necessary and suffi cient cause of population trends. Th e main factors contributing to the growth of population in India are the following:

**(i) Excess of birth over death rate:** Birth rate means the number of children born per thousand of living population. At present it stands at 26.1 compared to 30.9 in 1991 census. Th us, there has been a fall in birth rate, but along with it the death rate has also fallen, which came down to 10.8 per thousand. Th e achievement in reducing death rate has been due to the development of medical and health facilities accompanied by vaccination programmes. Th e TV channels are showing health programmes and educating the people about medical knowledge which have contributed to better health and lesser deaths. Th ere is a sharp reduction in infant mortality rate because the government is providing pre-natal and post-natal services. Although it may be argued that since the birth rate fell, it should not have led to the phenomenal increase in population. But this is a wrong argument. Th e decline of birth has only lessened the rate of increase in population, but the total numbers continue to increase because the lower birth rate is maintained by a large population with a low death rate. If the decrease in birth rate is not accompanied by a lesser decrease in death rate, population will go up. Population can decrease only if birth rate is lower and death rate is higher. In India both the birth rate and the death rate have decreased, so the eff ects of lower birth rate are negative by lower death rate. Formerly the average lifespan was only 27 years which has now increased to 70 years, which means that there are more old people in India than ever before. Th e old people due to their declining health are not suffi ciently productive and need economic support which amounts to greater burden on the country's productive resources.

**(ii) Social factors:** Some social factors such as attitudes of conservatism, religious obligation to procreate a male child, regarding marriage an inescapable obligation with the desire to produce children, looking down bachelorship and denial of certain privileges to the unmarried, marriage at lower age compared to the western countries, poverty and illiteracy, and feeling of dependence on God have also contributed to the growth of population in India.

**(iii) Climatic conditions:** Climatic conditions of India are very conducive to the growth of population. Th e tropical climate stimulates sex urge. Th e girls attain puberty at an early age, ranging from 12 to 15 years of age. Childbearing capacity of Indian women is greater and lasts longer.

**(iv) Poor publicity to family planning programme:** Th e family planning programme, which in the 1970s had been vigorously launched and people of all religions and faiths, high or low, rich or poor were forced to adopt, during the last few years has become almost non-existent. It has now been left to the good sense of the people to adopt family planning, and in India good sense is rare.

# **Eff ects of Population Growth**

If the population of a country does not exceed the optimum level, the number of people sustainable by the available national resources, it does not create any problem. Population growth is a problem

in relation to the available resources. In other words, it is a problem if the country's wealth cannot adequately support it. Some of the main eff ects of population growth are the following:

**(i) Low standard of living:** A large population usually means a low standard of living. Food supply being limited, people do not get enough to eat, even to survive. In diff erent parts of India, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Maharashtra, starvation deaths are not uncommon. Th e government calls them death caused by malnutrition and not by hunger. About 40 per cent of the people live below the poverty line.

**(ii) Heavy pressure on land:** India is an agricultural country. About 70% of the population lives in villages. Every child born in the village causes a pressure on land because he will get a share in the land owned by the family. Th e size of the land is narrowed thereby. In India, at present the average size of the agricultural land that each person could get is less than an acre.

**(iii) Pressure on urban areas:** Th e villages being unable to support the growing village population, the rural folk migrate to cities in search of employment thereby bringing pressure on the urban living space. Th ese rural migrants settle themselves in slums and dingy places. Th ere are not enough houses to give shelter to all the people. Acute shortage of houses has led to overcrowding, congestion, inadequate sanitary conditions, ill health, and many other civic problems. Th us, both the rural and urban areas suff er from the eff ects of population.

**(iv) Unemployment and poverty:** India already suff ers from underemployment coupled with unemployment. Job opportunities are not enough to provide job to each and every jobseeker. It is not only the illiterate and rural people who fail to get any job, even the educated urban dwellers are devoid of it. Unemployment is widespread among the professionally trained people. Th e statistics maintained by the employment exchanges do not give any exact idea of the level of unemployment in the country because there are no authentic and properly maintained records for this purpose. Th ere are no reliable fi gures available about unemployment among the illiterate people, those who earn their bread through daily wages. While many people suff er from unemployment, a large number of them suff er from underemployment or semi-employment. Th e unemployment problem is indeed grave in India which has even led to violence and crime, terrorism, and insurgency.

Poverty is the consequence of unemployment. Nothing to speak of comforts, the people are deprived even of the basic necessities of life. Per capita income in India is the lowest in the world.

India is faced with the problem of population growth. Overpopulation has shaken the very foundations of Indian polity, causing popular discontentment, terrorism, violence, political instability, economic uncertainties, and social tensions. Sound economic foundation is the basis for national security and prosperity. Overpopulation has adversely aff ected economic growth. Low income and low-saving capacity of Indian people have left little for capital formation and investment. Whatever little is produced is eaten by the growing population. Even that is less to ensure two meals a day to each and every citizen. Driven by acute poverty, poorer parents are committing suicides, including the killing of their children, which presents a horrible scene. Overpopulation is never in national interests.

# **Population Control**

Obviously, there is imperative need for controlling the growth of population. We cannot destroy or kill our large population to decrease its number. We can only control it, and for this purpose the state will have to devise a positive population policy. Before such a policy is devised, let us be clear about the diffi culties involved in family planning:

**(i)** Birth control is associated with a high standard of living which is very low in India.

**(ii)** Contraceptives are not safe, cheap, and easily available.

**(iii)** Th e message of family planning has not reached the remotest corners of the country—the villages which do not have accessible roads and fast means of communication.

**(iv)** Th e illiterate and backward people have failed to understand the benefi ts of the programme for themselves.

**(v)** Th e orthodox and fundamentalist people disfavour artifi cial methods of birth control. Th ey propagate self-control in place of forcible means of control.

**(vi)** Th e offi cials engaged in the programme have not sincerely and seriously operated it. Th ey have indulged more in exhibitionism than in conscientious implementation.

Th e Swaminathan Committee on population policy appointed by the Narsimha Rao government prepared a draft of population policy which was tabled in Parliament in July 1994, but since then, the policy has neither been debated nor discussed in Parliament. In August 1997, during the 50th freedom anniversary debate, a lot of concern was shown by MPs about population growth but nothing concrete came out. Th e population problem in India cannot be solved simply by food relief. If people are given plenty of food and nothing else in their lives is changed, they will build their population up to new food supply and start starving all over again, with more people to starve this time. Th e problem can only be solved by reducing fertility. If fertility is high, then in the long run mortality must also be high. As said, to reduce mortality without reducing fertility is at best a temporary and hazardous expedient. Even the whole of the world will not be able to feed India unless the people control fertility. Th e rate at which population of India is growing would bring the country to a situation where the people would not even have suffi cient space to stand. And if relief is suddenly withdrawn by other countries because of their dissatisfaction against our foreign policy pursued in respect of some important world matters, millions of us will starve. Th erefore, food relief from other countries is no solution to our population problem. We have to bring about fundamental changes in the economic and social organization of the country.

In India, the social attitudes of the people towards birth control need to be changed. Th e change in human attitudes for acceptance of fertility control programme cannot be achieved solely through target-oriented approach. It should be brought about by persistent and widespread information, education and communication activities, and provision of basic health and family welfare services. So far, it has been mostly the urban people, the well-to-do, who could most aff ord children, who have most rapidly adopted the use of contraceptives. Th ere is strong sense of indiff erence among the poor, who could least aff ord to have children, to the techniques of contraception. In the villages, the hold of traditional attitude is so deep-rooted that it off ers powerful obstacles to the easy success of birth control propaganda. Th ere is need for 'moral rationalization' of contraception due to the strong traditional hold in villages. Th e lack of knowledge on birth control and the illiteracy of the people also stand in the way of successful birth control movement. Th e technical problem of birth control is also far from solved. At the present time, no methods of birth control exist which are simple enough and eff ective enough to meet the need. It is also diffi cult for the state to open birth control clinics in lakhs of Indian villages. Although the state has recently

realized the importance of popularizing ideas of birth control among the people and has also been trying to provide them with more and more incentives at the family planning clinics, there is need to take bold steps with a fi rm political will and spend more for the success of the birth control movement. It may also be emphasized that in the light of the recent experience any family planning programme should be intelligently devised and judiciously implemented. Considering that the very future of the nation is at stake, any soft approach towards the population problem should be avoided.

#### **BEGGARY**

Associated with the problems of poverty and unemployment is the problem of beggary which is a social problem of great magnitude and grave concern in developing and underdeveloped countries where it exists in a crude form, but the developed countries are also not immune from it where it exists in the less degree. Begging is a curse both for the beggar and the society. Th e beggar suff ers from a sense of humiliation and shame and leads a life of squalor and fi lth. Beggary is a problem for children beggars. For them it is an undesirable environment in which to grow up. It implies undernourishment and inadequate opportunities for education. It means idleness, bad company, and delinquency. Begging is a problem for society—a large number of beggars mean non-utilization of available human resources and a drag on the existing resources of the society. Beggars are also a pubic health hazard. Th ey are often carriers of infection and disease. Th ey are marginal social groups and have been found to be associated with activities of the underworld.

Probably, India is the only country in the world where lakhs of its population wander about streets, public places, markets, temples, bus stands, railway stations, and even in moving trains with perfect freedom, living on the spontaneous unorganized charity of the individual citizen. Although beggars may be found in other parts of the civilized world, here the public tolerates persistent, open, and methodical begging in public places without hindrance. While in the west beggars beg on the sly and the citizen gives alms with a feeling of remorse, in India beggars beg importunately with the attitude of demanding their daily wages or with the contentment of proudly carrying on their parental profession. Th e citizens, in turn, dole out their charity with religious sanction and the selfsatisfaction of doing a good deed.

#### **Defi nition of Beggars**

It may not be possible to give a precise defi nition of the beggar. In England the beggar is described as any person wandering abroad or placing himself or herself in any public place, street, highway, court or passage, to beg or gather alms, or causing or procuring any child or children (under 16) to do so. In India a person who has no ostensible means of subsistence or who cannot give a satisfactory account of himself or herself is regarded as a destitute, a vagrant, or a beggar. (Criminal Procedure Code, Section 55(1))

Th e defi nition of beggary can be found in the vagrancy Acts of some of the states of India. On the basis of the provisions of these acts, the persons to be labelled as a beggar should satisfy these conditions:

**(i)** Th ey live by soliciting 31 m in any public place, temple or mosque, private premises, public street, road, or thoroughfare, or place of public resort, hotels, bus stops, pavements, markets, etc., for the maintenance of themselves or their family.

**(ii)** Th ey wander from door to door, exhibit or expose sores, wounds, bodily ailments, or deformities or make fraudulent pretences of them or allow themselves to be used as an exhibit for exciting pity for seeking alms.

**(iii)** Th ey are without any visible means of subsistence.

# **Types of Beggars**

Beggars have been classifi ed into various categories. According to Dr. Kumarappa, beggars can be classifi ed as follows:

**(i)** Th e child beggar, who may be a paid or an unpaid assistant of the adult beggar.

**(ii)** Th e physically defectives, including the blind, the deaf, the mute, the crippled, the maimed, and the deformed. Besides these, they are the chronically undernourished and affl icted with various organic troubles, or weakness of the vital organs.

**(iii)** Th e mentally defectives, including a large proportion of the destitute, immoral, delinquent, and criminal population.

**(iv)** Th e diseased persons, suff ering from infections, diseases such as leprosy, epilepsy, TB, venereal diseases, and skin diseases, with sores and ulcers covered with plasters on which myriads of fl ies settle and feed.

**(v)** Th e able-bodied, who consider begging as their birth right and bully, harass, and trouble the public into giving them alms, and who are lazy and roam cities. Th ey beg by day and turn into thieves and robbers by night.

**(vi)** Th e religious mendicant, so familiar is the fi gure of the sanyasi, the yogi, the sadhu, the bairagi, the fakir, and the darvesh with all the paraphernalia of saff ron robe, woodbead necklace, and bowl in hand.

**(vii)** Th e bogus mendicants, who are able-bodied laymen and who have no affi liation with any religious order whatsoever, but like to get on without work, don the grab of a fakir or a sadhu and profi t by the generosity of the unsuspecting and religious-minded orthodox people.

**(viii)** Th e tribal beggars, who move about from place to place singing and reciting local songs and begging. Among this class may be included the seasonal vagrant and the permanent vagrant. Th e seasonal vagrants comprise those migratory casual labourers who work on the fi elds or on some trade on craft in their native village during the season and in the off season migrate to larger cities where they live on footpaths or open maidans and maintain themselves by begging or stealing. Th e permanent vagrants are the migratory non-workers. Th ey are purposeless wanderers who beat their way from place to place, begging for food, getting in any way they can, and carefully avoiding rendering any useful service to the society.

**(ix)** Th e employed beggars are the persons who work in the night shifts in mills and factories and go out begging during the day.

# **Causes of Beggary**

Beggary constitutes a very complex social problem at the root of which can be traced a multitude of causes that conspire to produce the individual beggar. It is also intimately related with other social

problems such as unemployment, intemperance, poverty, crippling diseases, leprosy, lack of provision of old age, security, disruption of joint family, and mental derangement. Furthermore, in a country like India, where religion sanctions the formation of mendicant orders and also prescribes charity and public sympathy for mankind for one's own elevation, the problem of beggary assumes greater complications.

In a survey of the Beggar Problem in Greater Mumbai, Dr. Moorthy has mentioned the following causes, giving rise to beggary: overpopulation with consequent pressure on land and inability of land to support the people; system of land tenure; tyrannical landlordism; subdivision of holding coupled with large families and unprofi table methods of farming; debt; famines, fl oods, and epidemics which weaken the community or impose hardships; family breakdown; economic and emotional disabilities imposed on a man or woman after desertion; chronic and pernicious diseases; physical and mental handicraft; truancy and delinquency; inability to secure a job; unwillingness to work; religious bias and vow binding one to the mendicant order; antisocial attitudes and child lifting; lack of facilities for the welfare of the unattached, abandoned, and disabled; lack of facilities for training for employment; lack of social security and absence of social responsibility; attractions of city life, linked with the possibility of easy and ticketless travel; and the general outlook on life which inclines one to believe in destiny.

#### **Measures to Combat Beggary**

Most of the civilized countries of the world have long prohibited begging in public and declared it an off ence under the law. Whereas England began Poor Law Relief as early as the reign of Queen Elizabeth from the beginning of the seventeenth century, Japan has enacted social laws to care for the aged and infi rm in state and municipal homes, and begging in Japan is scarce as is in countries like Great Britain and Germany. But beggars still stalk the streets of China, India, Pakistan and other countries of the Middle and Far East and even some of the smaller eastern European countries though all have realized the fact that the beggar problem can never be solved by private charity however profuse and that state intervention and legislation are necessary if the allied problems of begging, destitution, and vagrancy are to be eff ectively tackled.

Special Acts have been passed by most of the states in India to prohibit beggary in public places. To deal eff ectively with persons who kidnap children for the purpose of exploiting them for begging, the Indian Penal Code (Section 263A) makes kidnapping or obtaining custody of a minor and maintaining of a minor for the purpose of begging specifi c off ences and provides for deterrent punishment which may extend to life imprisonment where children are maimed.

Th ese laws follow a more or less uniform pattern:

**(i)** Th ey prohibit and penalize begging in public places.

**(ii)** Most of them distinguish juveniles from able-bodied and disabled beggars, and commit juveniles to the jurisdiction of the Children Act and the able-bodied to workhouses and the disabled to special homes, if available.

**(iii)** Most of them are operative in areas on notifi cation by the government, and some of them operate only if there are special homes and workhouses.

**(iv)** All of them penalize escape or violation of discipline with imprisonment.

Th ere are institutions in the states for the custody and assistance of the beggars in their rehabilitation. Th e inmates of these homes are provided with food, clothing, education, and facilities for physical, cultural, and vocational training.

Mere legislative enactments would not stop the evil. Other measures need to be taken to root out and lessen this menace:

**(i)** Th e old attitude that charity blesses who gives and who takes should be abandoned, for it demoralizes both.

**(ii)** As begging is an off ence, the giver of the charity is a part of it and should be equally liable to punishment, even as the bribe giver is as guilty as the bribe taker.

**(iii)** When begging is declared prohibited, it is necessary to guarantee the beggars and their dependents an alternative and equally paying employment.

**(iv)** Social security services should be developed to look after the innocent dependents. At present the criminal law seems to reward the criminal with social security and penalizes the innocent with social insecurity.

**(v)** As there are diff erent causes and situations of beggary, the institutional treatment has to be adjusted to the diff erent categories of beggars. Poor houses should have an infi rmary for the disabled and diseased and other suff ering from non-infectious diseases. Child beggars should have a department where they may be taught to read and write and become self-supporting. Th ere should be a workhouse or an agricultural colony for the able-bodied never-do-wells who live by lying and blackmailing.

**(vi)** Provision of aftercare and follow-up should be a legal obligation. Development of placement agencies and aftercare hostels, marriage guidance bureau in case of female beggars, and setting up of establishments for the deformed and physically handicapped and leprosy patients should be the fi rst duty of the social welfare departments and social welfare agencies.

**(vii)** Considering the fact that among the large population of beggars in India good men suff er from hereditary defects as are likely to be transmitted to their children, it would be desirable to provide for the sterilization of such persons.

# **Conclusion**

It may be concluded that in spite of a plethora of enactments adopted by diff erent states—the Police Acts, Municipal Acts, and the Indian Railways Act—beggary goes on unchecked, assuming serious dimensions, leading to immeasurable crimes. Th e solutions to the problems call for a comprehensive programme and reorientation of the existing programmes. Philanthropic approach to beggar problem should be replaced by therapeutic and rehabilitative work, and a positive attitude towards work should be developed among the able-bodied beggars.

# **CRIME**

Crime or delinquency is a great social problem facing every society. Crime is an act forbidden by the law of the land and for which penalty is prescribed. Crime is the omission of an act which the law of the land asks to do or commission of an act which it forbids to do. Th e law may be written or unwritten. When the law is not written then crime is generally recognized as transgressions against the traditions or mores of the community. Crime, therefore, may be regarded as behaviour of individuals which the group strongly disapproves. And since societies do not have uniform standards of

right and wrong and since these standards change in a society from time to time, criminal behaviour is relative and not absolute.

Crime is said to be a major social phenomenon of modern civilized and advanced societies. Although there was crime in primitive societies too, but therein it was not a major social problem. In primitive societies, the mores are strong enough to control the individual behaviour eff ectively, and the few who disobey the rules do not constitute a threat to the community. In modern civilized societies, infl uence of mores has lessened and it is diffi cult to compel universal observance of mores. Th e modern societies have a population which is heterogeneous in race and cultural background and is diff erentiated into various classes. Th ey have several norms of conduct which often clash with one another, and have limited control over the behaviour of their members. In primitive societies called backward, there was a single code of beliefs and customs, the culture was static and homogeneous, and there was little institutional disorganization and a minimum class diff erentiation. Naturally, there was little crime among primitive tribes and in simple folk societies. But like many other social problems of our modern society, crime is also the price we have to pay for the advantages of civilization.

#### **Crime in India**

In India, there are no dependable fi gures on crime. Th e available statistics cover only those arrested and convicted, or the crime known to the police, and even these fi gures are not reliable. What is more serious is the white collar crime which amounts several times more than the conventional type of crime. By white collar crimes we mean the crimes committed by the upper strata of society in their business and professional practices. Th e securities scam, the sugar scam, the telecom scam, and the fodder scam are the recent examples. Racketeering, black marketing, tax evasion, adulteration, and corruption are some of the crimes committed frequently by the white collar men which have assumed serious proportions, threatening the entire social fabric. A more sorry state of aff airs is that the racketeers, black marketers, smugglers, tax evaders, and bribe takers exert considerable political infl uence and have entered the legislation. Our moral sense is at a low ebb. From the crime statistics or from newspaper reports, we can obtain only a slight idea of the prevalence of crime in the country. In India crime has increased steadily in recent years. Moreover, the data from the penal institutions show that a large percentage of inmates are repeaters, refl ecting the failure of our society to rehabilitate the criminal. Th e country spends several crores of rupees in detecting, convicting, and guarding the criminals, yet crime goes on increasing day by day. If we in India place a high value on wealth, prestige, and political power regardless of the way in which they are acquired and if the leaders refuse to abide by laws which they wish to be enforced against other persons, then, of course, we cannot expect the incidence of crime to go down.

#### **Causes of Crime and How to Combat It**

Th e sociologists are not unanimous on the point. Th e most accepted view is that the causes of crime are multiple and no single theory can explain all the causes. Th ese causes are biological, psychological, social, and economic. Among the biological causes, we may include insanity, physical disability, and defective glandular and nervous system. Th e psychological causes may be neurosis, psychopathy, and emotional instability. Th e social causes are social disorganization, social competition, social mobility, confl ict, defective social institutions, lack of education, sexual literature, cultural lag, and war. Th e economic causes are economic competition, poverty, unemployment, desire for more wealth, unlimited desires, industrialization, poor natural resources, infl ation, etc. Th e reasons for the persons having committed a crime can be discovered only after investigating their personality and environment. Some criminologists believe that only a completely renovated society, one in which there is no capitalism, can solve the problem of crime. Others, who do not go to this extreme, advocate reformatory rather than retaliative or deterrent treatment of the criminals. Ostensibly, the reform of the criminals is the main motive in their treatment today. In India various means are being explored for giving a better treatment to the criminals inside the jail. Th ey are being provided with more and better amenities of life. Besides suffi cient food, bedding, and clothing, they are provided with recreational facilities. Indoor and outdoor games are played, and tournaments are arranged in which teams from outside often participate. Even radios and televisions have been installed in some of the penal institutions. Th e present prison administration in the country guarantees a prisoner better food, clothing, medical attention, and recreational facilities than what are available to a poor honest person outside.

On the success of these measures, it is impossible to speak with any certainty. We cannot say whether these measures have been responsible for the cure of such criminals who do not reappear before the court or they have simply given up crime by a process of social maturation. However, it is universally recognized that punishment does not reform the criminal.

#### **PROSTITUTION**

Prostitution constitutes one of the major social problems and is a great social evil or vice. It is practised all over the world, both in developed and developing countries, rich and poor societies, and in all the communities. Th eir magnitude may however diff er from country to country and society to society. It is as much prevalent in the west as in the east. Once it was the privilege of the rulers, kings, and the aristocrats to indulge in this sexual pleasure on the strength of their riches, but at present it is sought after even among the middle classes and the poor inhabitants of a country. In India during the 1990s, there were 17,50,000 prostitutes and their number has been increasing by 3 lakh every year. At present in 2004, as per the fi gures given by the Bhartiya Patit Udhar Sabha (a well-known voluntary organization), their number is 23 lakh. Th e profession of sex workers or those carrying on the trade of fl esh has become so lucrative and money spinning that the women and girls from foreign countries also visit India to venture into this trade. Th ey do this even at the risk of being prosecuted by the police when indulging in this trade secretly in fi ve-star hotels and posh localities in metropolitan cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, and other big cities.

#### **Causes of Prostitution**

Th e causes compelling women and girls to enter into the profession of prostitution may be analysed as follows:

**(i) Heredity:** Girls born of prostitutes inherit this profession from their mothers. Th e atmosphere and environment they live in contribute to their taking up this profession, which has been practised by numerous generations.

**(ii) Poverty**: Due to abject poverty and no other means of livelihood, women and girls are compelled to adopt this profession.

**(iii) Exploitation**: Some women and girls are made to take up this profession, as they become victims of exploitation by the members of this trade. Th ey induce the innocent women folk with temptations of growing rich in no time. Once they have fallen a prey to the tactics of pimps, they are doomed to continue in this profession with no chance of escape.

**(iv) Marriages by force and sale**: Sometimes girls are married by their parents due to their inability to support them in the family, especially where a family has a number of girls. Th ey are married to men who are no match for them for a paltry amount of money or even sold without the marital ceremonies. Such so-called husbands use their wives as prostitutes to earn for them and recover the amount spent on their purchase.

**(v) Illegal immigration:** People entering our country through illegal means, especially from Bangladesh and other south Asian countries, forced by their adverse circumstances in the matter of earning their livelihood, mostly resort to prostitution of their women folk. Th at is why perhaps Kolkata is said to be having the largest number of red light areas in the country.

**(vi) Interstate migration:** Prostitution thrives more in some states of our country as compared to other states. Uttar Pradesh is the most notorious in this regard. Metropolitan cities are the den of prostitutes. Th erefore, women and girls opting for this profession seek to migrate to the places where they fi nd the trade of fl esh more lucrative fi nancially.

**(vii)Sexual bliss:** Prostitutes and their customers indulge in this trade to achieve sexual bliss satisfaction of their human lust. Besides there are prospects of enjoyment of music and dance, which constitutes conspicuous accompaniment of a prostitute, promising to exhibit the contours of beauty of a female body with glittering and tinkling ornaments.

# **Problems/Evils of Prostitution**

Th e profession of prostitution is disapproved, detested, criticized, and condemned in our society because of the various evils and problems that it suff ers from. Some of them may be mentioned as follows:

**(i) Social stigma:** Prostitution is viewed as a social curse and those practising it earn social stigma, shunned by society and community they live in. Th ey are socially boycotted and are not welcome in social functions.

**(ii) Unhealthy and unhygienic domestic atmosphere:** Families wherein prostitution is practised suff er from unhealthy and unhygienic family atmosphere and environment, having adverse eff ect on the upbringing of their children. Th ese children are rendered unable to conceive ambition of leading a healthy life pattern and realize their dreams of achieving something worthwhile in their lives.

**(iii) Responsible for numerous diseases:** Prostitution gives rise to numerous ailments and diseases to both the prostitutes and the men indulging in it. Most dangerous of these is AIDS, which is considered to erupt among those indulging in sex with women/girls besides their wives. AIDS is an incurable disease and thousands of people die in the world because of this deadly disease. It is therefore recommended by the health authorities all over the world that sex should be avoided with multiple numbers of women and one should exhibit loyalty to one's wife to be safe from this mortal disease.

**(iv) Harassment by police:** Since prostitution is an illegal profession, police personnel harass those indulging in it in more than one way. Th ey visit the brothels at odd ours, have sex with the prostitutes, and even share a percentage of their earnings through this profession.

**(v) Illegitimate children:** Th e greatest conceivable evil of this profession is the birth of children to prostitutes whose father being not known, termed as illegitimate children. Th e problem is how to take care of them and to rehabilitate them in a proper way. Th ere were 50 lakh such children in our country at the end of the twentieth century. Now, their number has grown to 52 lakh in the red light areas of the country.

**(vi) Deprived of the right of franchise:** It may sound strange, but the sex workers and their adult children are not provided photo identity cards in most places despite the instructions of the election commission.

#### **Remedial Measures**

Proper measures need to be taken by the community, the government, and the voluntary organizations to solve the problems of this unfortunate and condemned section of the society. Th e community needs to initiate programmes of awareness of the ill eff ects of this profession and help those indulging in it to give it up for their personal hygiene and to avoid various diseases especially that of AIDS.

National Institute of Social Defence under the ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is engaged in combating this menace by formulating plans, policies, and programmes for the welfare of the prostitutes and their off spring. Th e ministry is giving fi nancial assistance in the form of grants to numerous voluntary organizations engaged in the amelioration of this unfortunate section of society.

Th e Suppression of Immoral Traffi c in Women and Girls Act was passed by Parliament in 1956 and enforced throughout the country, replacing all the state acts on the subject. Th e main purpose of the Act is to inhibit the commercialized form of prostitution as an organized means of living. Th e Act provides penalties for the off ence of keeping a brothel; living on the earnings of prostitution; prodding, inducing or taking women and girls in premises where prostitution is carried on; prostitution in and in the vicinity of public places; and seducing or soliciting for the purpose of prostitution. Th e Act also provides the appointment of special police offi cers and non-offi cial advisory bodies to implement its provisions. Th e Act was amended in 1978 as suggested by the Law Commission to remove the lacuna it suff ered from and to make it more eff ective.

Protective homes have been set up for the care, protection, and rehabilitation of women and girls rescued from this vice. Inmates are imparted training in various trades in these homes and are subjected to such disciplinary and moral infl uences as are likely to promote the prospect of their reformation and rehabilitation.

Cooperation of the community is most essential to combat this evil. Th e Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment assists voluntary organizations in undertaking a variety of preventive services for moral and social hygiene.

#### **Care of Illegitimate Children**

Th ere are millions of children in India who are denied parental care in their formative years. Th e state cannot fi ll the void, but in recent years both government agencies and voluntary organizations have been doing their best within their limited means to provide these unfortunate children 'a home away from home'. But thus far no organization had ever thought of providing a healthy environment to the countless number of illegitimate children. Delhi administration's decision to adopt children born to prostitutes is bold and revolutionary and deserves praise. Th e Directorate of Social Welfare adopted 23 such children in 1989. It is a small beginning, but the mothers of these children deserve to be congratulated 'for taking this bold step towards making their children good citizens, by taking them out of the atmosphere in which they were born and brought up'.

According to the President of the Bharatiya Patita Uddhar, the eff ort is unsuccessful because the mothers are afraid to part with their off spring. Th ey are afraid because the 'madams' of the brothels and the pimps threaten them with dire consequences.

Even now the Delhi administration has a long way to go to secure the future of at least 5000 such children. For the time being, it has identifi ed 113 more children whose mothers are willing to part with them. To win the confi dence of the victims of human lust, it is absolutely necessary for the Delhi administration to make the experiment a success. And it seems to have done its homework. For instance, the administration is keeping the name and place of the institution where these children will be housed a closely guarded secret. Th e objective is to prevent the pimps from establishing contact with them. Besides, such secrecy will help the administration in the task of rehabilitating them without any social stigma. It is to be hoped that other states would emulate the Delhi model and introduce similar schemes. Th e task is indeed stupendous. However, one can expect a better tomorrow at least for the children, particularly in view of the Supreme Court directive to the Union of India and the state governments to open separate hostels for the rehabilitation of the children of prostitutes in an 'open and healthy environment'.

In conclusion, the ignoble profession of prostitution is assuming large proportions as is evident from the increasing number of women and girls entering this profession every year. Th ese unfortunate women and girls are compelled to adopt this profession driven by factors such as heredity, poverty, domestic atmosphere and environment, sensual and sexual pleasures, blissful entertainment, illegal immigration, and interstate immigration. Th e problems faced by the prostitutes are harassment by police, exploitation, and contracting of numerous diseases especially the deadly disease of AIDS.

Th e steps taken by the government are mainly in the form of legislations, especially of suppression of immoral traffi c in women and girls, providing protection and homes for those rescued from this vice, training for their rehabilitation, fi nancial assistance by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment to the voluntary organizations to help them in their eff orts to combat this evil, and arrangements for the care of the illegitimate children; all this will go a long way in minimizing, if not completely eliminating, this degrading trade of fl esh.

#### **JUVENILE DELINQUENCY**

Juvenile delinquency denotes crimes among children below the age of 18 years. Th e crimes committed by children vary in types, degrees, and dimensions and range from petty thefts, stealing, pickpocketing, dacoities and robberies, causing injuries from simple to grievous and to the extremes of committing murders, notwithstanding rapes, looting, and arsons. Th e victims of the crimes lodge reports with the police or other immediate authorities; cases are registered against the culprits, investigated and tried by the concerned courts. If the accused persons are found guilty, they are punished, and their punishment may vary from admonishment and fi ne, to simple or rigorous imprisonment, determined by the nature of the crime.

We come across cases of crimes by boys and girls in all societies—backward and advanced, poor and rich, illiterate and educated—that can be attributed to a number of reasons such as the following:

**(i) Poverty:** Th irty per cent of people in India are living below the line of poverty. Most of them do not even get two square meals a day. Th ey go to sleep hungry on the footpaths without any roof over their heads. Children of such families are obliged to take to criminal acts to support their living.

**(ii) Abandonment or loss of family:** Sometimes children are abandoned by their families, or they suff er the loss of their families and have nobody to support them. Th ey therefore have to take up to one or the other kind of crimes for their existence.

**(iii) Breakdown of homes and values:** Breakdown of homes is a common phenomenon because of disputes between the parents, leaving the children to fund for themselves. Th ere has been erosion of values as well, one of them being sense of responsibility of parents to provide healthy atmosphere to their children to grow into responsible citizens, thus compelling the children to take to a life of crimes.

**(iv) Adverse eff ect of media:** Children are adversely aff ected by the reports in media, especially the electronic media, about crimes of various magnitudes, prompting them to similar means and methods in their lives. Th e evil eff ects of television and cinema are conspicuous in moulding the lives of children who learn various methods of committing crimes and try to practise these in their own lives.

**(v) Antisocial elements:** Th ese exploit the innocent children by luring them to acquire wealth and pleasures by resorting to acts of crimes.

**(vi) Drugs and alcohol:** Th e stress of modern living and increasing isolation is gradually increasing the member of people dependent on drugs and alcohol. Children of these parents fi nd it diffi cult to resist from such intoxicants and fall a prey to these vices, leading to crimes.

**(vii) Breakdown of joint family system:** Children feel safe and secured in a joint family where all members of the family provide care and protection, showering on them abundant love, aff ection, and care. But now with the replacement of joint families by nuclear families, children are devoid of proper guidance because their parents are extremely busy, resulting in neglecting the children which results in children forming bad habits including that of criminal nature.

**(viii) Urban migration:** Urban migration and conversion to market economy are also leading to emergence of vulnerable groups especially of children.

**(ix) Child labour:** Th e International Labour Organization reports that India has 44 million working children, the highest in the world, accounting to one-third of child labour in Asia and one-fourth of the world's working children. Lakhs of children of the primary school age, who are working in humiliating and often cruel circumstances in the households and some thousands being kept in virtual captivity in subhuman conditions by the owners of wayside street shops, do not fi gure in general surveys or census. Fed-up with the atrocities committed on them at their workplaces and inadequate wages, children take up crime in pursuit of better living.

**(x) Illegitimate children:** Th ere are millions of children in India who are denied parental care in their childhood. Most unfortunate of such children are the illegitimate ones mostly born of prostitutes. According to rough estimates, there are 50 lakh illegitimate children and 1 lakh 75 thousand prostitutes in the country. Such children are bound to adopt crime as their profession unless alternate means are provided for their proper rehabilitation.

# **Remedial Measures**

It is unfortunate that budding children aspiring to blossom in their youth should be condemned to life of crimes, bringing a blot to themselves, their parents, community, and the country. It is

therefore desirable that necessary measures should be taken to ensure the children a life free of crimes, to enable them to grow into a happy, healthy, and useful citizen. Th e following remedial measures can be suggested to meet the challenges of crime among children:

**(i) Alleviation of poverty:** Poverty being the root cause of crime among children needs to be eradicated. Various governments have been campaigning for 'Garibi Hatao' (remove poverty), but there has been no marked improvement. Children in cities and towns especially in slum areas are exposed to living conditions, urging them to resort to criminal activities to rid themselves from the evils of poverty. City life therefore needs to be free from temptations to crime, especially the slums, in order to erase this evil.

**(ii) Provision of free and compulsory education:** Article 45 of our constitution states that the state shall provide, within a period of 10 years from the commencement of the constitution, free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of 14 years. It is regrettable that this provision of the constitution has not been enforced.

 With the passing of the 86th amendment to the constitution, universal education for all the children up to the age of 14 years has become mandatory. Th is has made all the more necessary for the concerned ministers/departments to strive for universal education with a great sense of urgency.

 Moreover, there are dropouts from schools for various reasons, primarily that of poverty. Th e governments are providing midday meals or free food in the form of wheat and rice to the students in lieu of cooked food to ensure their continuation in studies. Provisions like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan have encouraged children to attend school. Th is will help the children to lead a life free of crimes.

**(iii) Education about moral values:** In their formative age, children should be taught the moral values of honesty, integrity, truth, mutual help, character building, etc., in their schools as a part of their curriculum. Th e religious institutions and voluntary organizations should also devote themselves to this aspect of education of children to instil a spirit of confi dence in them. Th e publicity of hymns like 'Mera Vishwas Men Pehchan' (my confi dence my identity), through television and other media these days, will create enviable virtue among children and inspire them to shun from the acts of crime.

**(iv) Abolition of child labour:** In Article 24, our constitution specifi cally makes provisions that no child before the age of 14 years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in another hazardous employment. Article 39 of the constitution further stipulates that the health and strength of workers, men and women, and the tender age of the children are not abused and the citizens are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength.

 Strict enforcement of these provisions of the constitution will go a long way in preventing the children to resort to acts of crimes which they are forced to adopt, being aggrieved by the atrocities committed against them while engaged in child labour.

**(v) Abolition of jails for children:** Th e Supreme Court has many a time observed that jail is hardly a place where a child should be kept. Even whether the children are accused of off ences, they must not be kept in the jail. Justice V. K. Krishna Iyer had remarked, 'Jail for juvenile should be outlawed'. Former Chief Justice of India, Justice P. N. Bhagviati, had held, 'It is an elementary requirement of any civilized society that children should not be confi ned in jails because incarceration has a dehumanising eff ect and it is harmful to the growth and development of children'.

 It is regrettable that children are kept in jails of matured criminals where they are abused and exploited. Th ey live in inhuman conditions and are used as helpers to prepare food, clean and sweep rooms, wash clothes, and fetch water for jail inmates. Moreover, they would turn into hardcore criminals staying in their company. Th e Supreme Court has therefore indicted the states for not providing separate facilities for children in jails and for not opening reformatory institutions, borstal schools, remand homes, or observation homes where children can be kept. Th e atmosphere of the jail has highly injurious eff ect on the mind of a child estranging him from the society and breeding in him aversion, bordering on hatred against a system that keeps him in the jail. Th e government has not got suffi cient accommodation in its remand or observation homes; therefore, the children should be released on bail instead of being subjected to incarceration of jails.

**(vi) Care and protection of children:** Th ere is no doubt that primary responsibility of providing care and protection to children and to wean them away from crimes is that of a family. But the central and the state governments have yet to make their constitutions in this regard. Th e Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment under its Social Defence Programmes makes eff orts towards rehabilitation through adoption, foster care, sponsorship, and sending the children to an aftercare organization to protect them against crimes.

**(vii) Integrated programmes for street children:** Th e purpose of this scheme launched by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is to provide adequate facilities for withdrawal from life of vagrancy (which promotes crime among children) on the streets and towards reintegration with families. Th e programme provides shelter, nutrition, health care, education, and recreational facilities to street children and seeks to save them against abuse and exploitation.

 State governments, union territories, administrative local bodies, educational institutes, and voluntary organizations are eligible for fi nancial assistance under the programme. Th e programme components under the scheme are establishment of 24-hour drop-in shelters, non-formal education, vocational training and placement, health care and treatment programmes, counselling, guidance, referral services, etc. Th ese measures will certainly be of great help to children to avoid embarking on a life of crime and instead adopt a life of which all the concerned may be proud.

**(viii) Childline services:** Childline having a dedicated number 1098 is a 24-hour toll-free telephone service available to children in distress or adults on their behalf. Th e basic objectives of Childline are to respond to the emergency needs of the children in diffi culty and refer them to such services as they are in need of, to sensitize hospitals, medical personnel, police, etc., towards needs of children, to ensure protection of their rights, and to provide an awareness to the communities to respond to the needs of the children in diffi cult circumstances.

**(ix) Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000:** Th is recognizes the legal necessity of care and protection of children who are below the age of 18 years. It is an act to consolidate and amend the law relating to juveniles, and children in need of care and protection. Th ey do this by providing them with proper care, protection, and treatment and adopting a childfriendly approach in the adjudication and disposing of matters in the best interest of children and for their ultimate rehabilitation through various institutions.

**(x) Programme for juvenile justice:** Th e Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is implementing a scheme called, the Programme for Juvenile Justice. Its main objectives are to extend help to the state governments to bear the cost of development of infrastructure and services under the Juvenile Justice Act. Th e purpose is to see that in no circumstances a child in

confl ict with law is lodged in a regular prison, to ensure maximum quality standards in juvenile justice service, to provide adequate services for prevention of social maladjustment, and to provide rehabilitation of socially maladjusted juveniles.

Th e means and measures, referred to above, aim at the protection of juvenile delinquency and help to overcome circumstances and conditions responsible for taking these children on the route of crime.

#### **CORRUPTION**

Under the heading 'adoption of unfair means to hoodwink the society' we may include the study of corruption.

Corruption is a universal phenomenon. It is unfortunate that India is ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world. Corruption is defi ned in the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, as 'whenever a public servant, accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain from any person, for himself or for any other person, any gratifi cation whatever, other than legal remuneration, as a motive or reward for doing or forbearing to do any offi cial act or for showing or forbearing to show, in the exercise of his offi cial functions, favour or disfavour to any person or for rendering or attempting to render any service or disservice to any person, with the central government or any state government or Parliament or the legislature of any state or with any local Authority, Corporation or Government Company'.

Corruption is rampant in India which is acclaimed as a land of seers, sages, and saints and of high moral values of truth, honesty, and integrity. Not a day passes when we do not hear/read about a scam or a scandal taking place in diff erent parts of the country. In recent times, most important scandals have been Bofors payoff , fodder scandal, telecom scandal, petrol stations and house allotment scandals, urea scandal, and paper leakage scandal. Th ere are corruption cases, such as the recent one in Punjab, of the chairman of the Public Service Commission, Ravi Sidhu, amassing enormous wealth. Every job in the commission had a price tag attached to it ranging in thousands, lakhs and crores of rupees depending on the importance and prestige of the job. In Haryana, appointments of police inspectors and teachers have been alleged to have been sold to the undeserving candidates. Th e most sensational corruption case is the scam of ` 30,000 crore of fake stamp papers by Telgi. Corruption is prevalent among the functionaries of government departments and public sector undertakings, right from the lowest offi cial to the highest offi cer. Ministers, MLAs, and politicians—all are involved in it. No fi le can move from one desk to the other unless the offi cial concerned has been bribed.

Anticorruption campaign has been going on in Punjab since the Congress government has come into power. Akali MLAs have been booked though they claim that it is a political vendetta. Th ree congress ministers were found guilty of corruption by the Lok Pal of Punjab, but they were not permitted to proceed against by the then Governor of Punjab.

Most of the public servants from the lowest offi cial to the highest offi cer indulge in corruption as they are alleged to possess properties disproportionate to their known sources of income. Ministers and members of legislature (centre and states) have multiplied their wealth after occupying their positions.

It is a pity that the judiciary which is the custodian of the rights of the people and is expected to be honest has also been tempted by corruption, and not only petty judicial offi cials but High Court judges have also been charge sheeted for corruption.

Corruption scandals do not seem to be diminishing. Th ere have been reports of corruption being indulged in by various Public Service Commissions and recruitment agencies. Money plays a great role in appointments, promotions, and transfers. Cases of corruption among ministers and bureaucrats are also not declining.

# **Causes of Corruption**

Th e various causes of rising corruption may be discussed as follows:

**(i) Rising cost of living:** During the past four decades, infl ation has been causing abnormal rise in the prices of the articles of consumption and goods of luxury. Th e employees are said to be obliged to resort to corrupt means to increase their income to meet the ever-increasing cost of living.

**(ii) Large size of families:** Despite the government policy to encourage family planning and limit the size of a family to two children, families are growing in size; some of the employees have to support half a dozen children and their old parents. Th ey require substantial increase in their income to support their families and are obliged to increase their income through corruption.

**(iii) Erosion of moral values:** Th e ethical values of honesty, integrity, and right means of earning have eroded. People therefore do not hesitate to accept bribes to augment their incomes.

**(iv) Competitive race to excel others:** Th e feeling of jealousy against people possessing more wealth urges employees not only to reach their standards but also to excel them, and hence they use any means including foul ones to achieve this objective. If a person possesses a Maruti car and the neighbour an Indica or other cars of greater value, he will not rest until he has got one like that and perhaps a better one.

**(v) Riches the symbol of status and power:** Wealth determines the status and power of individuals and families. People will therefore attempt to attain and amass maximum amount of wealth to surpass others.

**(vi) Complicated and rigid procedures and rules of government offi ces and transactions:** People have to suff er delays and inconveniences to get their requests processed and accepted because of complicated rules, papers passing through various channels, resulting in indefi nite delays. Th ey therefore prefer to indulge in giving bribe to get their work expedited.

**(vii) Delay in disposal of corruption cases:** Th e corruption cases are not decided expeditiously. Some of them take years to be investigated and tried. Th e scandals and scams referred to above have been pending for indefi nite periods, thus encouraging the corrupt employees not to bother much if they are charged with corruption.

**(viii) Nexus between politicians/bureaucrats and criminals:** It is often revealed that politicians, bureaucrats, and underworld elements are corroborators in cases of high corruption. Th ey escape because of their links with the high ups and the authorities.

**(ix) Lack of deterrent punishments:** Persons found guilty of indulging in corrupt practices are seldom awarded deterrent punishments to ensure the elimination of corruption. Moreover, it is the small functionaries who are charged of corruption and are let off with minor punishments and the big fi sh are seldom booked and punished severely.

**(x) Diffi culties in unearthing ill-gotten wealth and arresting the culprits:** Th e persons charged with corruption evade arrest and go underground and are declared as proclaimed off enders, thus delaying their prosecution. Th ey manage to get their wealth deposited in foreign countries

or invest in benami properties. Banks in Switzerland are committed not to disclose the accounts of the foreigners. It is a diffi cult procedure to get the criminals extradited if they have fl ed to a foreign country and we have no extradition agreements with such countries.

# **Measures to Combat Corruption**

Corruption has assumed menacing proportions in our country. Black money is causing great damage to our economy. It is bringing bad name to our old traditions of moral values. It is therefore urgent to take necessary measures to eradicate corruption or at least to minimize it for the welfare of our people. Th e following measures can be suggested in this regard:

**(i)** It is desirable that the salaries, allowances, and other perks of the employees should be automatically increased with the rise in infl ation to compensate them for increase in the cost of living.

**(ii)** Our religious and spiritual leaders should impress on the employees and the public the teachings of our scripture in respect of truthful living and merits of honesty and integrity and the evils of ill-gotten money and exhort them to put these principles into practice in their dayto-day living.

 Th e instruction of these values should also be imparted in educational institutions so that our younger generations grow into honest citizens.

**(iii)** A discontented life, greed, avarice, jealousy, and the desire to become rich overnight through illegal means and practices needs to be discouraged, as life of contentment brings bliss and happiness, removes tension of mind, and contributes to a healthy living.

**(iv)** Procedures of functioning of the government offi ces and agencies and their rules and regulations need to be simplifi ed to avoid unnecessary harassment to the citizens.

**(v)** Offi cers, ministers, and MLAs should be easily accessible to the public to enable the latter to bring their grievances to the notice of the former and seek their redressal against the callousness and demands of the lower offi cials.

**(vi)** Complicated procedures and numerous bottlenecks including corruption deter NRIs and foreign companies to invest in our country. If one window system, where the enquires of the investors are responded and the formalities are completed, is introduced, much of the inconvenience and harassment and delays can be reduced to attract foreign investment.

**(vii)** Corruption cases are generally instituted against the offi cials at the lower ranges of administration as against those at higher ranges. Th e former are punished whereas the latter go scot free. It is the politicians and offi cers at the higher echelon of administration against whom charge sheets of corruption should be levied and expeditiously decided.

**(viii)** Th e judicial process including prosecution, investigation, and trial needs to be expedited and judicial pronouncements need to be made within the minimum possible period, to make the corrupt people realize that the cases against them cannot be prolonged for indefi nite periods, stretching over years and years. Th e corruption cases against political leaders are deliberately prolonged for years together.

**(ix)** Persons found guilty of corruption should be awarded maximum punishments including death sentence to deter persons from indulging in corruption.

**(x)** Th e central government agencies such as Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), and State Bureaus of Vigilance should function independently and not succumb to any political pressure and get the culprits expeditiously punished in the court of law.

**(xi)** It is surprising that institution of Lok Pal to check corruption among politicians and public servants has not been set up at the centre despite the fact that the bill to this eff ect had been presented in the Lok Sabha for six times. Th is confi rms the lack of political will on the part of the government and other political parties to accept this watchdog against corruption. Again though Lok Pal/Lok Ayukts have been functioning in some states, it is regrettable that no Lok Pal has been appointed in Punjab after the demise of the erstwhile incumbent and the offi ce has been abolished in the state of Haryana.
