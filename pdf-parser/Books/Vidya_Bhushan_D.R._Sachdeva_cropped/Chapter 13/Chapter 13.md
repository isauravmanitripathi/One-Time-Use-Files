# **Social Stratifi cation**

![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg)

If we glance at the society around us, we fi nd that it is heterogeneous in nature. Here are the rich, there the poor; here are the industrialists, there the peasantry; here are the rulers, there the sweepers. Everywhere society is divided into various classes—economic, social, political, and religious.

# **MEANING OF SOCIAL STRATIFICATION**

Th e process by which individuals and groups are ranked in a more or less enduring hierarchy of status is known as stratifi cation. According to Raymond W. Murray, 'social stratifi cation is a horizontal division of society into "higher" and "lower" social units'. Every society is divided into more or less distinct groups. Even the most primitive societies had some form of social stratifi cation. As Sorokin pointed out, 'Unstratifi ed society, with real equality of its members, is a myth which has never been realised in the history of mankind'. He writes, 'Social stratifi cation means the diff erentiation of a given population into heretically superimposed classes. It is manifested in the existence of upper and lower social layer. Its basis and very essence consists in an unequal distribution of rights and privileges, duties and responsibilities, social values and privations, social power and infl uences among the members of a society. No society is unstratifi ed. Stratifi cation involves the distribution of unequal rights and privileges among the members of a society'. According to Gisbert, 'social stratifi cation is the division of society into permanent groups or categories linked with each other by the relationship of superiority and subordination.' Lundberg writes, 'A stratifi ed society is one marked by inequality, by diff erence among people that are evaluated by them as being "lower" and higher"'.

From the defi nitions stated above, it would be seen that *inequality of status* or rank diff erentiation is the distinguishing feature of social stratifi cation; where there is social stratifi cation, there is social inequality. Some individuals and groups are rated higher than others on the basis of opportunities and privileges that they enjoy. For example, in India doctors or engineers are rated higher than teachers. As a class the former have a higher social prestige. Th e prestige attached to diff erent positions becomes a part of the social order and that is stratifi cation.

Stratifi cation tends to *restrict interaction.* In a given stratifi cation system, certain kinds of interaction may be more restricted than others, as in seeking a marriage partner, ill choosing a profession, in making friends.

According to some sociologists, the origin of stratifi cation is to be found in the conquest of one group by another. Th e conquering group set itself as an upper class dominating the conquered class which became a lower class. Sorokin, however, does not agree with this theory. According to him, stratifi cation originated in the inherited individual diff erences and diff erences in environmental conditions.

Racial diff erences accompanied by cultural dissimilarity also lead to stratifi cation. India was subjected to a series of racial and cultural invasions that overwhelmed the native people and eventually led to the caste system. Race is the chief factor in the American stratifi cation system.

According to Spengler, stratifi cation is founded on scarcity. Short supply or security is created whenever society diff erentiates positions in terms of functions and powers and assigns rights and privileges to them. Th is makes some positions more desirable than others for society grades them by their rewards. Th ere are only a few corporation presidencies or government executive offi ces available. Stratifi cation evolves from the allocation of scarce privileges and powers.

Kingsley Davis lays emphasis on the functional necessity of stratifi cation. According to him, social inequality is an unconsciously evolved device by which societies ensure that the most important positions are conscientiously fi lled by the most qualifi ed persons. Hence, every society must possess a certain amount of institutionalized inequality or social stratifi cation.

# **CHARACTERISTICS OF SOCIAL STRATIFICATION**

Th e main characteristics of social stratifi cation are the following:

**(i) It is social**: Stratifi cation is social in the sense that it is not biologically inherited but socially accorded. Biological traits such as intelligence, strength, and sex do not determine social superiority or inferiority until they are socially recognized and evaluated. Further, it is governed by social norms and sanctions and is intimately connected with other systems of society such as political, religious, economic, and other institutions.

**(ii) It is ancient**: Th e stratifi cation system is quite old. No society has ever been without it.

**(iii) It is universal***:* Th e stratifi cation system is universal. It is a worldwide phenomenon. Social diff erences are visible everywhere. According to Sorokin, all permanently organized groups are stratifi ed.

**(iv) It is in diverse form**: Th e stratifi cation system has never been uniform in all the societies. Th e ancient Roman society was stratifi ed into patricians and plebeians. Th e Aryan society was divided into four *varnas*—Brahmins, Khatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras. Class, caste, and estate are the general forms of stratifi cation.

**(v) It is consequential**: Social stratifi cation leads to two important consequences—life chances and life styles. Life chances refer to mortality, longevity, illness, marital confl ict, and divorce. Life

#### **150** Chapter 13

styles include matters such as the mode of housing, living, one's education, mode of recreation, and relation between parents and children.

#### **FORMS OF SOCIAL STRATIFICATION**

Social stratifi cation assumes the form of class divisions in society. In the course of history, various social classes have existed at diff erent periods. Th us, the slaves and slave masters, vassals and feudal lords, capitalists and workers have been the prominent classes. In western countries, the common form of social stratifi cation is class system, whereas in India class has assumed a peculiar form in caste.

Since social stratifi cation means division of society into social classes, now we shall examine the idea of a 'social class'.

#### **Meaning and Nature of Social Class**

According to Ginsberg, 'a class is a group of individuals who through common descent, similarity of occupation, wealth and education have come to have a similar mode of life, a similar stock of ideas, feelings, attitudes and forms of behaviour'. Th e relative position of the class in the society arises from the degree of prestige attached to the status. Wherever the considerations of status, lower and higher, limit social intercourse, the social class exists. Th e status is the basic criterion of the social class or, in other words, class is a status group. MacIver and Page write, 'Th is understanding of social class as a distinct status group provides us with a precise concept and is generally applicable to any system of social stratifi cation, wherever found. It is the sense of status, sustained by economic, political or ecclesiastical power and by the distinctive modes of life and cultural expressions corresponding to them, that draws class apart from class, gives cohesion to each class and stratifi es a whole society'.

Th us, in a social class there is, fi rstly, a feeling of equality, in relation to members of one's own class, a consciousness that one's mode of behaviour will harmonise with the behaviour of similar standards of life. Individuals belonging to the same social class are expected to maintain similar standards of life and to choose their occupations within a limited range. Th ere is realization of a similarity of attitude and behaviour with members of one's class. Secondly, there is a feeling of inferiority in relation to those who stand above in the social scale. Th irdly, there is the feeling of superiority to those below in the social hierarchy.

Th us, the fundamental attribute of a social class is its social position of relative inferiority or superiority to other social classes. It is the social position which determines for its possessor the degree of respect, prestige, and infl uence.

Th e members of each social class constitute a group. Th ey recognize one another as social equals and distinguish in a variety of ways between themselves and the members of other classes. Th ey usually associate with the members of their own class and live together and apart from other classes. Th ey have their own distinctive ways of life. In a sense, each social class is a society within a society, but it is not a complete and independent society.

A social class is distinguished from other classes by certain customary modes of behaviour which are taken to be characteristic of that class and may be concerned with things such as the mode of dress, the type of conveyance, the way of recreation, and expenditure. Th us, the upper class is released from manual labour, and its members are masters rather than servants. Its members live in the castles, rather than in the huts, eat the choicest food, and have leisure.

It is also to be noted that the members of a social class often put obstacles in the way of those people who wish to come up to their position. It also means that a class possessing certain privileges would like not only to possess them exclusively but also to increase them. Capitalists and upper classes never like to give up their privileges voluntarily.

# **Criteria of Class Distinctions**

Society, as history tells us, has been divided into diff erent classes at diff erent times. Now, the question arises: what principles are involved in the various modes of social classifi cation? Characteristics, such as occupation, wealth, birth, race, religion, education, speech, and etiquette, may become the basis for social ranking. Sometimes, two or more characteristics combine to determine the status:

**(i) Criterion of birth**: In feudal and early medieval times, the status was fi xed by birth. Th us, there were the slave and slave master, the noble and serf, the gentry and the commonality. When the status is determined by birth, the class structure becomes rigid.

**(ii) Criterion of wealth**: Birth as a determinant of the status remained the controlling factor of social position until new social and economic developments undermined the feudal system. Under the feudal system, the principal form of wealth was the land. Th e idea of subservience, loyalty, duty, and honour depended on the intrinsic fact that one man holds land from another who thereby is his superior. But with the progress of Industrial Revolution and with the growth of commercial, fi nancial, and factory production enterprise, wealth was redefi ned so that land was now subordinated to the new forms of money and credit. In modern societies, there is a fairly close relation between economic and social status. Wealth has now penetrated all social divisions and provided a universal and signifi cant basis for social stratifi cation. Classes are now demarcated as an upper class, a middle class, and a lower class.

**(iii) Criterion of occupation:** In modern communities, wealth is the primary determinant of social stratifi cation. It is the possession of wealth for the most part which determines the sort of education an individual is likely to receive and consequently the range of occupations open to him/her. Th ere is an intimate relation between the social class and the occupation it follows. Occupation, while not an altogether accurate indication of the status, is a fair index of a social class, its mode of life, and general social standing.

 Take, for instance, the case of farmers. In earlier times, there were two great classes associated with the land—the land owner and the land cultivator. In modern times, a class of 'owner cultivators' has come into existence. In India, through the abolition of *zamindari* system, tenants have been made the owner of the land they cultivate. Th ey are now no longer dominated by a land-owning aristocracy. Th ey employ relatively a few labourers outside their family; moreover, their relation to the labourer is not the same as that of the landlord to the peasant. Th e owner farmer and the tenant farmer now form together an agricultural class with common characteristics arising from the nature of their occupation. Th ey have more or less a common standard of living, their relatively low and inelastic income and a common group consciousness, and form a separate social class.

 In recent years, within the agricultural class also social stratifi cation is developing. With the introduction of mechanized forms of cultivation, some of the agriculturists have become farmhouse owners, tractor owners, and white collar agriculturists, enjoying higher status. At the other end of the scale, there stand the low-class peasantry with their traditional implements of agriculture separating themselves from the high-class peasantry.

 Similarly, in non-agricultural fi eld, the type of occupation is a particularly useful general index of the social class. Th e so-called white collar jobs carry greater prestige than the jobs otherwise, though the former may not yield greater income. If the lower paid teacher is held in a greater esteem than the better paid technician, obviously, income does not determine the social status. Ministers, secretaries, commissioners hold a higher position than the businessmen who may be wallowing in wealth, though formers are of an inferior economic position.

**(iv) Criterion of polity**: In the modern society, the political system is an important determinant of social study. A democratic, political system aims to abolish the social distinctions and establish social equality, which means that no person will be rated high or low on the basis of one's income, occupation, or birth. An aristocratic political system, on the other hand, starts with the belief that some are born to rule and others to be ruled. Such a system stratifi es the society into distinct classes of rulers and ruled. In every society, rulers have enjoyed a higher status. In democracy also, legislators and ministers enjoy a higher prestige though some of them may even be illiterate.

**(v) Criterion of education**: Th e social class and education interact in two ways. Firstly, to get higher education one needs money. Th e children of wealthier classes can get better education and ride up to the highest step of social hierarchy. Th e poorer youths cannot aff ord to meet the expenses of higher education and so are left at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Secondly, people's amount and kind of education aff ects the class rank they will secure; higher education not only brings occupational skills but also brings changes in tastes, interests, goals, etiquette, and speech.

Thus, we conclude that though wealth is a significant factor of social stratification in modern communities, it is not, however, the only factor. The attitude which a community holds towards the different groups is determined by a number of factors. Thus, factors such as race, age, sex, lineage, religion, occupation, education, and mode of life may still modify and limit the status attitude. Sometimes, the attitude held by a community may be merely traditional and not the result of any logical conclusion. To know why a community classifies a particular class inferior or superior, we may have to study the past or present experiences which have produced that attitude. In the case of the United States, the prevalent attitude assigning the low status to Negroes is perhaps adequately explained by the historical fact that Negroes were assigned to a slave status for more than one hundred years. Every society has a large inheritance of purely customary, habitual, and non-functional class stratification for which no rational justification can be found. Therefore, in attempting to account for the fact of social stratification, we must not lose sight of the factors for which no rational justification can be found. We need not be surprised at the lack of rational foundation for many of the facts of social organization.

# **SOCIAL CLASS AND STYLE OF LIFE**

Th e style of life of people is determined by the social class to which they belong. A social class is generally distinguished from other classes by certain modes of behaviour which includes things such as the mode of dress, the type of conveyance, the mode of recreation, and the contents of diet. Th e members of a particular class have more or less the same 'life chances'—the same probability of securing the good things of life. Lasswel has well said, 'Th e infl uential are those who get the most of what there is to get'. Th us, the members of a social class possess similar social chances, and since classes diff er in their social chances so they also diff er in what they learn, how they behave, and how they regard the world about them. We fi nd great diversity in the outlook and behaviour of the several social classes. Th us, the members of the upper class hate manual labour. Th ey live in castles, ride automobiles, eat the choicest food, put on superfi ne clothes, and speak polished language. For recreation they visit clubs and play sophisticated games such as golf, tennis, and chess. On the other hand, the members of the lower class are given to manual labour. Th ey live in slums and take coarse food. Th ey are shabbily dressed and hardly know of any recreation. Similarly, the members of the upper class are educated and hold administrative posts or run big industrial concerns. Th e members of the lower class are mostly illiterate and labourers. Th ey are servants rather than masters.

It has also been found that criminality prevails more among the members of the lower class than those of the upper class. Th e lowest levels of the social hierarchy furnish the greatest number of criminals.

Studies also show diff erences in the family behaviour of the diff erent social classes. Th e lower classes rear their children in the homes and observe strict sex code. Th e children in the upper class families are reared by maid servants and fed on the bottle milk. Th e children brought up in the upper class families are taught to be polite, to develop good manners, to pay attention to dress and appearance, to play with equals, to get good grades in schools, and to stress achievement. Th e lower class children learn the opposite in most instances.

Th us, it is evident that the social class aff ects the life style of its members. Th ose who belong to a superior class enjoy greater status, prestige, and power. Th ey have a high notion of their selfimportance. Th e members of the inferior class, on the other hand, are given to obedience and yield to the wishes of the superior class members. Indeed, there is hardly any aspect of life which is not differentiated according to the class one belongs to. Social classes constitute subcultures and, therefore, the groups which live diff erently, also think and behave diff erently.

However, whatever infl uence the social class may still have on the style of life, it is waning. Occupation is rapidly becoming the key determinant and index of the status. Members of lower classes change their style of life on having secured a berth in the cabinet or administrative hierarchy. Occupation is now more predictive about the style of life. Th e style of life of a family unit depends chiefl y on the occupation of parents.

## **THE MARXIAN CONCEPT OF CLASS**

Karl Marx, the father of Communism, gave an economic interpretation to the meaning of class. Th us, he diff erentiated between the bourgeoisie who own the means of production and the proletariat who do not. Th e bourgeoisie enjoy the high status in society because they own property, while the proletariat's status is inferior because instead of owning the means of production they rather work on them. According to Marx, therefore, ownership of the means of production determines the status of individuals. Max Weber also conceived of class as the product of economic factors. He asserted that 'property and lack of property are the basic categories of all class situations'.

Marx also said that all previous history had been the history of class struggle, a condition that would cease; however, when the proletariat organized to overthrow the bourgeoisie in bloody revolt establishes an international classless society of proletarian.

MacIver has criticized the Marxian distinction between proletariat and bourgeois classes as basically erroneous and ill founded. Th e identifi cation of the social class with economic division is inadequate for two reasons.

#### **154** Chapter 13

Firstly, there are status-class diff erences which do not correspond to economic diff erences. Th us, members of the Brahmin class, a superior class, may be the employees of a lower class and very inferior to the latter with respect to wealth. According to the Marxian thesis, Brahmins would form an inferior class because they do not own property in this case, but in Hindu society they nevertheless are considered belonging to the superior class. Again, an old-established landed class may be regarded as socially superior to a monetarily wealthier class. White collar clerks may not earn more than a manual worker and even earn less, yet their status is higher in society to the status of the manual worker. Th us, they are economically inferior but socially superior. Moreover, all the workers cannot be grouped into a single class, the proletariat. Th e modern, western society makes distinction between workers in diff erent fi elds and of diff erent skills. Th ey diff er in their interests, attitudes, and sentiments. Th ere is found competitive class feeling among the workers. One can hardly think of them as belonging to one class. Even the capitalists do not form a single class. Th e small capitalists are opposed to big capitalists. Th eir interests collide and so they can hardly be regarded as members of the same social class.

Secondly, if we defi ne the social class in terms of any objective criterion, such as ownership of property, it loses its sociological signifi cance. Th e distinguishing feature of a class is its possession of 'class *consciousness*', a sentiment that unites them and separates them from others. If white collar workers do not regard themselves as belonging to the same class as industrial workers, they do not form one social class. Th e members of a class share a common sentiment, and unless they share this sentiment they cannot form a social class. Marx maintained that the experience of similar economic situations develops similar attitudes and beliefs in the members of a class—a class consciousness. But there is no necessary coincidence between class membership defi ned by economic criteria and subjective class consciousness. It is important, as Tawney says, to avoid confusing 'the fact of class with the consciousness of class which is diff erent phenomenon. Th e fact creates the consciousness, not the consciousness the fact'.

Moreover, Marx could not foresee the later evolution of industrialism, with its separation of ownership and managerial functions, and its demand for a vast new middle class of clerks, managers, and technicians. Th e rise of the middle class ended the drift towards two isolated camps of capitalists and industrial workers. Th us, Marx is proved to be a false prophet about the evolution of classes in the modern world. Th e distinctions among classes are more than economic; they are also social, political, attitudinal, and based on a way and style of life. In their behaviour individuals are not motivated solely by economic interests.

## **THEORY OF FUNCTIONALISM—KINGSLEY DAVIS AND WILBERT E. MOORE**

Davis and Moore presented their functional theory of social stratifi cation in 1945 in an article 'Some Principles of Stratifi cation'. Th ey began with the observation that stratifi cation exists in every known human society. Th ey argue that all social systems have certain functional prerequisites which must be met if the system is to survive and operate effi ciently. One most fundamental prerequisite is eff ective role allocation and performance. Th is means that all roles must be fi lled, and these must be fi lled by the best able to perform them. Th ey must be given appropriate training to ensure their best performance, and the roles must be performed diligently and conscientiously. Th ey argue that all societies need some mechanism for ensuring eff ective role allocation and performance and this mechanism is social stratifi cation which they see as a system which attaches unequal rewards and privileges to the diff erent people of society. If the people and position which make up the society did not diff er in important respects, there would be no need for stratifi cation. However, people diff er in their innate ability and positions diff er in their importance. Certain positions are functionally more important than others. Th ey require special skill for their eff ective performance, and there are limited numbers of individuals with the necessary ability to acquire skills. A major function of stratifi cation is to match the most able people with the functionally most important position. It does this by attaching high awards to such positions. Th e device for such rewards motivates people to compete for them, and most talented will be successful. Such positions usually require long periods of training which involve certain sacrifi ces. Th e promise of huge rewards is necessary to provide an incentive to encourage people to undergo training and to compensate them for the sacrifi ce involved. It is essential for the well-being of the society that those who hold functionally most important positions perform the role to the best of their capacity. Th us, Davis and Moore conclude that social stratifi cation is a device by which society ensures that major, important functions are consciously performed by the most qualifi ed persons.

#### **Criticism of the Theory**

**(i)** Davis and Moore themselves realized that the diffi culty with their theory is to determine which position is functionally more important. Th ey observe that a position highly rewarded does not necessarily mean that it is functionally important. Th ey, however, suggest that the importance of a position can be measured by the degree to which the position is functionally unique; there is no other position that can perform the same function satisfactorily. Th us, it could be argued that a doctor is functionally more important than a nurse since his/her position is carrying many other skills necessary to perform the role of a nurse but not vice versa.

 Th e second measure of importance is the degree to which other positions are dependent on the one in question. Th us, it may be argued that managers are more important than routine staff since the latter are dependent on the directions from the management.

**(ii)** Bottomore holds that the theory concerned is in terms of ranking individuals and does not explain the existence of well-defi ned social groups.

**(iii)** According to Melvin M. Tumin, the theory ignores the importance of power in unequal distribution of rewards. Th us, diff erences in pay and prestige between diff erent groups may be due to diff erence in their power rather than their functional importance. He further observes that social stratifi cation functions to integrate the social system but the diff erential reward system can encourage hostility among the various groups in a society.

# **CONCLUSION**

Functional theory of stratifi cation emphasises the proper allocation of roles to individuals and their implementation, most important functions to the high-qualifi ed persons, and the higher rewards to them. Davis and Moore hold that social stratifi cation is a functional necessity for all the societies and it is the solution to the problems faced by all social systems that of placing and motivating individuals in the social structure, and that it implies that social inequality is an inevitable feature of the society. Th ey conclude that diff erential awards are essential for society and for maintenance of well-being of the social system.
