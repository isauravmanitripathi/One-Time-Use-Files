## **GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY**<sup>2</sup>

In 1874, when Charles Darwin's younger cousin Francis Galton published *English Men of Science: Their Nature and Nurture*, Galton was no doubt aware of Shakespeare's priority, for when Prospero spoke of Caliban in 1611, calling him "A devil, a born devil, on whose nature nurture can never stick; …,"<sup>3</sup> one of the most entrenched dialectics in all of biology was born.

The impasse, widened in 1690 by John Locke's now well-worn metaphor of the newborn mind as a *tabula rasa*, <sup>4</sup> a blank slate on which nature had scribbled nothing, became contentious when Galton insisted, to the contrary, that nature had ordained not language itself, but differential capacities for language; not genius, but differential predispositions for the realization of genius. It was as if Galton had supposed that nature had indeed written on Locke's clean slate, but that she had written her messages in invisible ink, and that the slate had to be held over a flame before the messages could be read.

Somewhere between these polarized philosophical views, between the *nature uber alles* of Galton and the environmental determinism of Locke, an empirical middle ground is currently being excavated, a middle ground that rejects neither view and that successfully incorporates components from each. Nowhere has this become clearer than in the complex interactions of disease agents, disease vectors, and the gene-based responses of their human hosts.

*Genetic epidemiology* is the study of genetic elements of disease, and is a growing methodology for understanding how those elements function in complex biological systems. Genetic epidemiologists seek to discover and understand the genetic basis of diseases, traits with complex inheritance patterns, and risk factors associated with gene-based diseases within specific environmental contexts (Mai, Young Owl, & Kersting, 2004; Motulsky, 1984).

The conjunction of the terms "genetic" and "epidemiology" at first may seem a forced blend; an attempt to meld two separate approaches that is doomed to chronic marbling rather than complete synthesis. However, some of the recent work of geneticists, epidemiologists, and, indeed, genetic epidemiologists, has blurred the once distinct barrier between these approaches. Classical Mendelian genetics has an increasingly limited utility in terms of understanding the complexity of many diseases and genetic predispositions to cytotoxic agents. The new mechanisms that have only recently become understood are for the most part *epigenetic* rather than genetic.

This review will address the possibility of an epidemiological transition, and end with a discussion and illustration of "transmissible" (in the epidemiological sense) genetic disease.

The concept of an epidemiological transition as a continuum that can be organized into stages similar to the well-known demographic transition has existed for some time (Corruccini & Kaul, 1983; Lappe, 1994). Such a continuum might extend well back into Miocene primate ecology, and from there forward into the Plio-Pleistocene foraging, scavenging, and hunting behaviors of early hominids. During these millennia, hominids continued to adapt genetically. They brought forward with them not only the genetic markers of prior adaptations, but also a host of commensal and parasitic "heirloom species" (Barnes, Armelagos, & Morreale, 1999). Humans cohabit a parallel evolutionary universe with body lice and enterobacteria that evolve and speciate in synchrony with us (Hafner & Nadler, 1988; Klassen, 1992). We possess anticarcinogens against most plant-related agents (Ames, 1983; Steinkellner et al., 2001) but fewer against meat-related agents, especially heterocyclic amines (HCAs) in cooked meat (Adamson et al., 1996; Sugimura, 2000). These observations reflect the long, slow process of this epidemiological transition.

The roots of the anatomically modern human epidemiological transition extend back at least 10 millennia, to a time when humans began to exploit marine environments extensively, and adapted both immunologically and digestively to the consumption of shellfish and other marine organisms (Walter et al., 2000).

The beginning of the human epidemiological transition proper, however, occurred when some human groups shifted from gathering and hunting to primary food production and the domestication of animals (Corruccini & Kaul, 1983; Diamond, 1997, p. 207). A second transition occurred when acute infectious diseases were controlled and the prevalence of chronic, noninfectious, and degenerative diseases increased; a third transition, according to some researchers, is defined by the "re-emergence and emergence of antibiotic-resistant diseases on a global scale" (Barnes et al., 1999; note 1, pp. 229–230).

Genetic diseases such as *sickle cell disease* (*SCD*) 5 could be considered classic stage one/two "noninfectious" adaptations. "Genetic epidemiology" describes the distribution of gene-based adaptations when driven by an environmental agent, in this case the distribution of the infections agents of malaria, various species of *Plasmodium*.

Genetic diseases are increasing in prevalence, and perhaps in incidence as well. Some of this change may be an artifact of expertise, as higher resolution diagnostic tools are invented, and as diagnostic skills improve. A substantial proportion, however, is a sequela of improved treatment, and is the consequence of relaxed selection (see the entry Genetic Disease I).

Genetic diseases exhibit focal patterns. Some are as well known as *SCD*, others are less well understood. Some residual genotypic spatial distributions are thought to reflect past episodes of infection, such as cline of the *I <sup>B</sup>* allele in Europe that may be due to selection against the *I <sup>A</sup>* allele during a smallpox epidemic (Bodmer & Cavalli-Sforza, 1976, p. 404). Other conditions with genetic manifestations will eventually be shown to be congruent with the distributions of nonorganic agents, such as foci of chemical mutagens, regions of high radioactivity, or pools of environmental carcinogens. Age-dependent genetic diseases will be found to cluster where demographically aged populations reside.

Classically, the distribution of some genetic diseases can be attributed a few already well-understood factors. Foremost among these are consanguinity (inbreeding), and the founder effect (drift).

Every genetic entity with significant present-day prevalence can be traced, at least theoretically, back to an ultimate mutation, the single source that was the founder of the modern distributions. Nowhere has this been more obvious than among the closed demes, where many genetic conditions—including *breast cancer* and *Tay–Sachs disease* (among the Ashkenazim); *autism, lactose persistence*, and the 32 mutation in the *CCR5 gene* (among Icelanders); *polydactyly, dwarfism*, and *maple syrup urine disease* (among the Old Order Amish of Lancaster County, PA); *congenital adrenal hyperplasia* (among the Yu'pik Eskimos); and *achromatopsia* (among the Pingelapese people in Micronesia)—have been accounted for by these mechanisms (Lewis, 2001, p. 246).

The geographic removal of closed demes from one region to another is at times the sole mechanism invoked to explain the spatial variation of a genetic disease, known as a founder effect. For example, 30,000 living Afrikaaners (out of 2.5 million) have *porphyria variegata*. These affected individuals are all descended from a single pair of peripatetic colonizers who emigrated from Holland to South Africa in 1688.

In other cases, the slower dispersion of expanding populations into hominid-empty ecological niches appears to be the simplest explanation. Native Americans, for example, seem by some accounts to have entered

North America from Siberia in three major waves between 33,000 and 5,000 years ago; by other accounts, there was only one continuous dispersion event (Dillehay, 2000, p. 241). The second of these alleged waves, between 15,000 and 12,000 years ago, consisted of founders whose descendants today have high incidences of *albinism* and the *New World syndrome*. Any of the well-documented diasporas has left a similar genetic trail (Brown, 1990; Owens & King, 1999).

In any case, most simple monogenic conditions, if they are compatible with life, and if reproduction is possible (or permitted), and if sustained in a population for many generations, can potentially be reconstructed. Most of these reconstructions will resemble a dendritic funnel, with many branches at the open mouth ending in clusters of demes composed of living individuals that carry the inherited alleles. These extend back in time, downward into the throat of the funnel, twigs joined together into branches, branches into limbs, and limbs into a single ancestral trunk representing the family of the individual with the original mutation.

In the absence of other forces, a unique founder will have offspring who will live and die more or less in situ, as will grandchildren and all future heirs of the mutant allele. In this most simple—and most unlikely of all cases, an undisturbed distribution would, at least in theory, appear as a perfect circle with the greatest density (highest allele frequencies) near the center. Humans are not bacteria, however, and while it may be possible to find such a neat distribution in a Petri dish, most human distributions have been affected dramatically by the contingencies of history: by wars and local catastrophes, by colonization, by economics, by the depletion of regional resources that necessitated outmigrations, by cycles of prey movement, by the ebb and flow of weather patterns. Entire branches of the human tree have been broken off and flung to the winds, some being crushed in the process. Others have withered, while yet others have flourished and increased, pushing smaller demes toward lands with marginal resources.

The reconstruction of the human tree has already commenced. A body of journal articles, books, and computer programs under the general rubric of "genes, people and languages," provides an entrée to the literature that documents this ongoing task (Cavalli-Sforza & Cavalli-Sforza, 1995; Layrisse & Wilbert, 1999).

## **DISTRIBUTIONS OF GENETIC DISEASES**

Genetic diseases currently fall into three epidemiological groups: (1) familial, (2) transmissible, and (3) sporadic.

Simple cases of familial genetic disease exhibit classic Mendelian patterns of disease with uniform, unambiguous phenotypic presentations. These are cases with a "family history," even if generations are skipped, or even if affected persons receive the condition through progenitors of the opposite sex. *Tay–Sachs disease* and familial *Down syndrome* are examples of familial conditions. More complex genetic diseases are now known to exist, as well. These are cases where "non-Mendelian" mechanisms such as *anticipation, genomic imprinting*, or *mitochondrial inheritance*, are a major factor (see Genetic Disease I). In either case, familial genetic diseases exhibit genealogical clustering: there is often a clinical propositus or proposita, and other family members with the condition are thereby discovered.

Transmissible cases of genetic disease are more ambiguous but usually manifest as a well-defined clinical entity, such as in the *prion diseases*. In some cases there may be no known family history. The criterion that distinguishes this group from the others is that those affected have a clear gene-based potential for disease acquisition, but an environmental co-factor is required to precipitate the condition. One of the difficulties of diagnosis inherent in these conditions is that, because both a common predisposing genotype and an environmental co-factor are involved, some diagnosticians will be disposed to emphasize either one or the other—the condition will be perceived arbitrarily as either genetic (nature) or environmental (nurture)—rather than as co-factorial. Both *Kuru* and *new variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease* can now be viewed as clear members of this category (see Genetic Disease I). Transmissible genetic diseases exhibit spatial clustering. Because the environmental agent will appear to have a point of origin, and will appear to have spread outward from that point, such cases usually will appear at first glance to be epidemiological in nature. Affected individuals may be the first in their family, in recent memory, to acquire the condition. Only upon close examination of DNA will it become clear that affected individuals also have in common a predisposing genotype, and without that genotype others are—even upon exposure or

infection—"immune" to the condition, or experience a milder form, or display a delayed onset, etc.

Sporadic cases of genetic disease exhibit neither familial nor spatial clustering. These cases are neither widely diffused nor epidemic, occur only occasionally, and appear not to be directly inherited. *Sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease* will serve as an example. These sporadic cases are entertained as "genetic" only because of a consistent clinical presentation that cannot be excluded from other such cases with a known pattern of inheritance. Some of these may be true phenocopies. This is a difficult but intriguing group, and may have in common some of the same non-Mendelian mechanisms such as *anticipation* discussed under the familial category, above.

Eventually, worldwide distributions of genetic diseases will be described in terms of regional geography in much the same way that the classic non-morbid gene systems (*ABO, PTC*, etc.) and certain portions of DNA have already been analyzed (Cann, 2001; Cavalli-Sforza, Menozzi, & Piazza, 1994). However, genetic epidemiology is yet in its infancy, and comprehensive tables of morbid distributions have yet to be developed beyond those for blood groups where maternal–fetal incompatibility is an issue (e.g., *Rhesus isoimmunization*, the *Diego antigen*), and for the hemoglobinopathies (*SCD* and the *thalassemias*).

This survey is necessarily limited in scope; selections were made after consideration of historical significance, prevalence,6 and representation of etiologies. Many of the more common conditions that are known to have a genetic component are not included.<sup>7</sup> In consideration of the interests of medical anthropologists, certain conditions relating to malabsorption and diarrhea have been over-represented; causes of cancer and degenerative conditions are under-represented.

Existing prevalence or incidence information for populations is sketchy; a portion of the extant data is summarized in Table 1, which consists of four columns.

Column one contains the name of the trait and its acronym (e.g., Achondroplasia, ACH), its assigned McKusick *OMIM* number(s) (e.g., 100800), mode of inheritance (e.g., AD), and mapped chromosomal location of the implicated gene or region (e.g., 4p16.3). A hyphen (-) in column one indicates that a datum is missing or unknown. Abbreviations used include AD for autosomal dominant, AR for autosomal recessive, AC for autosomal codominant (or incomplete dominance), XR for X-linked recessive, XD for X-linked dominant, YL for Y-linked, MF for multifactorial, MCA for major chromosomal anomaly, and Unk for mode of inheritance unknown. A chromosomal location, such as 4p16.3, indicates that the trait has been mapped to the shorter p arm (the longer arm is the q arm) of chromosome pair 4, to or including Q-band 16.3. Sometimes a mapped range is given, such as q16.3–q16.6. See the reference list on page 453 for the URL of *OMIM*, where further details concerning standard nomenclature can be located.

Column two contains a brief list of presenting symptoms, onset and course of the disease, and prognosis, as well as facts about the cause of the condition, its known or suspected molecular etiology, mutation rate, and relationship, if any, to similar conditions.

Column three contains, where known, incidence, prevalence, and/or allele frequency data, and geographic regions or populations characteristically affected by the condition. Incidence refers to the frequency of new cases of a genetic condition in a specific population per unit of time. Prevalence refers to the frequency of a genetic condition at a particular time in the general population.

Column four provides an entrée to the current literature for each condition, usually selected either as a recent journal article(s) not posted in *OMIM*, or as a book or monograph that, as a rule, would not be posted in *OMIM*.

**Agammaglobulinemia**, One of the heritable primary immunodeficiency diseases Rare; between 100 and 700 PID cases 006 **Bruton type** (300300, XR, (PIDs) characterized by lack of mature B-cells associated per country in Europe and the Xq21.3–q22) with immunoglobin (Ig) heavy chain rearrangements. United States. Affected individuals cannot synthesize certain antibodies. Defect is caused by mutations in the Bruton-type tyrosine kinase gene (BTK), an essential regulator in B-cell development (AKA agammaglobulinemia, X-linked, XLA). An AD form also exists (186973, AD, 5q32). Cf., **ADA deficiency** and **severe combined immunodeficiency disease**. **Albinism, ocular, type I,** The term albinism refers to any one of several inherited Rare; incidence is about 1:60,000. 007 **X-linked** (**OA1**; 300500, XR, conditions in animals and plants. In humans, albinism is Xp22.2) usually caused by an autosomal recessive allele that blocks a step in the production of the pigment melanin by failure to produce an enzyme essential to the process; associated with a lack of pigment in the skin, hair, eyes and/or other tissues (amelanic melanocytes). In X-linked OA1, only the eyes lack pigmentation; females more severely affected than males. A second form of X-linked OA also exists (OA2, 300600, XR, Xp11.4–p11.23). See **OCA**, below, and **Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome**. **Albinism, type I**, Absence of the pigment, melanin. In OCA1 (complete or Affects at least 1:20,000 children 008 **oculocutaneous, tyrosinase** "classic albinism") absence of melanin affects the eyes, worldwide (regardless of parental **negative** (**OCA1**; 203100, AR, hair, skin, and hearing.

OCA1 is a condition that affects melanin synthesis. The impaired protein in OCA1 is tyrosinase, an enzyme that normally reduces the amino acid tyrosine into DOPA or DOPA into dopaquionone; melanocytes thus lack melanin pigments. More than 60 causal mutations in tyrosinase have been identified; it is therefore a heterogeneous condition. Most OCA1 individuals are compound heterozygotes; AKA tyrosinase-negative albinism. There are about a dozen other forms of albinism.

Because of its high prevalence in North America, biotechnology companies have targeted the gene as a likely candidate for profitable gene therapy. There are CF homologues in other species.

**Deafness, neurosensory 1** Deafness is impairment of the sense of hearing, either Common: 1.2–2.3:1,000 children 035 (nonsyndromic, 220290, AR, congenitally or through post-natal loss; the term can refer to have congenital hearing 13q11–q12) either partial or complete deafness. Although over impairment; about half are genetic 70 genes are known to cause congenital hearing loss, in the in origin, that is, about 12 million people most common mode, hearing loss is due to mutations in the worldwide have genetic-based gap junction protein connexin 26 (C 26). Inherited hearing loss. deafness is hearing loss that is genetic in origin, which is about half of all cases; two major forms of inherited deafness are recognized: syndromic deafness and nonsyndromic deafness. Non-syndromic deafness is a genetic defect in a single gene that causes multiple medical problems, only one of which is deafness; for example, **Waardenburg syndrome**; 70% of cases of inherited deafness are non-syndromic (i.e., 35% of all cases). Syndromic deafness is a genetic defect in a single gene that causes a single medical problem, deafness; for example, **Pendred syndrome**; 30% of cases of inherited deafness are non-syndromic (i.e., 15% of all cases). AKA hereditary hearing loss.

significant problems in certain pregnancies. "Rh incompatible" matings occur whenever a higher parity pregnant dd female can make antibodies to D antigens present in her Dd fetus. The source of the fetal D antigens is the DD or Dd father. Without intervention, the Dd fetus is at-risk for **hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN)**. Other major polypeptides in the blood group include the Cc/Ee antigens (111700, AD, 1p36.2–p34), but there are over 40 other antigens in this series, as well. For clinical purposes, Rh phenotypes are reported as Rh (DD, Dd) or Rh (dd), but denoting haplotypes for the three major alleles (e.g., cde, cDe) is more accurate. Isoimmunization also occurs in several other blood groups, including the ABO, **Diego, Duffy**, Kell–Cellano and Gerbich blood groups, but Rh incompatibility accounts for more than 90% of cases.

An increased probability of recurrence among close relatives and a high concordance between identical twins suggests a genetic component of high but unknown magnitude. Schizophrenia is genetically heterogeneous, multifactorial and/or probably polygenic presentation. Alternatively, schizophrenia has been suggested to be due completely to environmental agents, caused for example by maternal influenza during the second trimester, when fetal brain cells are undergoing rapid hyperplasic growth, and are susceptible to the effects of such a virus.

The affected gene is the interleukin-2 gamma receptor chain (IL2RG); about 150 different mutations have been identified. There is also an autosomal recessive Swiss form (SCID; 202500, AR, 8q11). About 50% of all U.S. SCID is XSCID; another 5% is due to **adenosine deaminase deficiency**, and the remaining 35% is either the AR form or of unknown etiology.

This is a very small sample of the more than 5,000 known gene-based entities. For additional information, see Mai et al. (2004) and McKusick et al. (2004). The *OMIM* was consulted for all 150 entities, and a major portion of each digest was abstracted from that source. Most of the conditions listed here are well-documented one-locus anomalies with a straightforward mode of inheritance and complete penetrance. A few are polygenic or multifactorial, and a few are indicated as controversial. Supplemental data can be found in recent references for each condition as noted in the final column.
