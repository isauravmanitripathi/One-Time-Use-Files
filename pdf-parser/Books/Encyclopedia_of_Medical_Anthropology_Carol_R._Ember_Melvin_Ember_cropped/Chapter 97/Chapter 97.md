# **Shipibo**

#### **Warren M. Hern**

## **ALTERNATIVE NAMES**

Shipibo, Conibo, Chama.

## **LOCATION AND LINGUISTIC AFFILIATION**

The Shipibo are located in the upper Peruvian Amazon. Their communities are found principally along the banks of the Ucayali River and its tributaries from Atalaya to Requena or on lakes off the main course of the river. The coordinates of the area are approximately 6 to 9 South and 75 West. Upstream on the Ucayali from the town of Pucallpa, the Shipibo are known locally as the Conibo, although the language spoken and the culture shared by the Shipibo/Conibo are essentially the same. The entire group will be referred to here as "Shipibo."

Shipibo is one of the Panoan languages of the Amazon. Panoan speakers tend to be concentrated around the upper Ucayali drainage basin in eastern Peru and western Brazil.

The word "Shipibo" is not generally used by the Shipibo to describe themselves. They tend to use the word "jonibo" (person [pl.]) in reference to themselves and the word "nahuabo" (foreigner/stranger/not-person [pl.]) in reference to others who are not Shipibo. The term "Shipibo" has been used by members of other tribes to refer to the group under discussion because of their custom of capturing and maintaining as pets specimens of the pygmy marmoset (*Cebuella pygmaea*), the smallest known primate, which is indigenous to the eastern Peruvian Amazon. In Panoan languages, this animal is called a "shipi." The suffix "bo" indicates plural.

The term, "Chama," is considered by the Shipibo to be a highly derogatory term that is used by the Peruvian mestizo population to portray the Shipibo as a subhuman underclass. The term is found in some early anthropological literature.

## **OVERVIEW OF THE CULTURE**

The Shipibo are thought to have occupied the upper Peruvian Amazon area for about 1,000 years. They have principally and traditionally inhabited small settlements on the banks of oxbow lakes ("cochas") and small tributaries of the Ucayali, although there have been both riverine and interfluvial groups. The latter groups, living away from large rivers, maintained a cultural ecology adapted more to the forest with wild game as protein sources. The predominant riverine groups, on the other hand, depend on fish as a primary but not exclusive protein source.

The Shipibo have long had a highly developed ceramic tradition, and their contemporary pottery is internationally known for its beauty and craftsmanship. Pots are used for cooking, eating, and ceremonial purposes, and sometimes for decoration.

The Shipibo women are also accomplished weavers, using a native cultivated cotton for making yarn and thread. They use a backstrap loom for large bolts of cloth that may be 10–15 m long and require the weaver to secure the distal end of the longitudinal threads to a tree. Small exquisitely decorative pieces such as bracelets and anklets are woven in the same manner with tiny looms.

The geometric and repeating patterns used by the Shipibo are distinctive and are painted or engraved on pottery, cloth, faces, oars and clubs, and anything that might retain the figures.

Until the last few decades, the Shipibo economy has largely been one of subsistence supported by fishing, hunting, gathering, cultivation of high carbohydrate plants such as yucca (at least two varieties of manioc, *Manihot esculenta* sp.), plantain, and a large purple sweet potato (Bergman, 1980). More recently, rice and corn have been sown and cultivated for the market as well as for consumption. Chiclayo (black-eyed pea) is sown and cultivated on the exposed river beaches in the dry season.

Traditional Shipibo family patterns tend to be matrilocal and matrilineal, although this appears to alternate from generation to generation (Abelove, 1978; Eakin, Lauriault, & Boonstra, 1980; Hern, 1992b). Sororal polygyny was widely practiced in the past but is now much less common. Levirate and sororate are practiced: the brother of a man who has died accepts his deceased brother's wife as a second wife. She is often the sister of her new husband's first wife.

Cross-cousin marriages were the preferred marital arrangements in the past, particularly in polygynous families.

A typical Shipibo village consists of a single matrilocal extended family containing five or six nuclear families and representing as many as four generations. A specific example is a study community of 48 persons in which the oldest couple, parents of several daughters, have a household that includes several grandchildren in addition to the original couple. The most prominent man in the community is the husband of three of the couple's daughters, each of whom has her own hearth and household where her children reside. As a woman's daughters come of age, the woman's household may be joined by a young man who is a suitor or husband to one or more of her daughters. A son of hers is likely to leave the community to find a wife elsewhere.

Larger Shipibo communities appear to be the result principally of missionary activity in 19th and early 20th century (Myers, 1990). Catholic then Protestant missionaries induced aggregation of various family groups into small communities that were more susceptible to proselytization for religious purposes.

Missionaries describe some encounters with the Shipibo as extremely dangerous (Samanez Y Ocampo, 1980). This was particularly true for more isolated groups such as the Pisquibo: Shipibo who lived along the banks of the Pisqui river, a tributary of the Ucayali. Shipibo are depicted in various accounts as ruthless in the treatment of their enemies, especially the Cacataibo, or Cashibo as they are called by the Shipibo. In the early 20th century, Europeans and Peruvian nationals seeking to exploit the rubber and timber resources contracted with the Shipibo to drive the Cacataibo out of the areas of economic interest. The Cacataibo were driven deep into the forest and the Shipibo are now afraid to penetrate into the territory of the allegedly ferocious Cacataibo. Also during the rubber boom and during the late 1930s, some Shipibo were taken as slaves from the Ucayali region to other parts of the Amazon.

The traditional leader (*curaca*) of a Shipibo community is the male head of a large extended family, with an informal but permanent status until death, old age, or disability requires him to accede to a younger man. Currently, the Shipibo choose a village chief on a rotating basis and elect officials to conform with the national governmental structure. These leaders generally consist of an chief "jefe de la comunidad," or *curaca* (traditional), a *teniente gobernador*, official representative to the district government, and *agente municipal*. These are not traditional Shipibo designations, but the community process by which leaders are currently chosen resonates with traditional Shipibo methods of dealing with issues that affect the community. Community assemblies are attended by both men and women, and while male leadership predominates, women express their opinions vigorously and often prevail.

Traditional Shipibo religious views and cosmology are animistic. Spirits reside in various living things, specifically certain trees and animals, and in the stars. Fresh water dolphins are of particular interest and are not killed because of their intelligence and capacity to inflict harm on humans. The best published description of Shipibo cosmology is *The Cosmic Zygote* by Peter Roe (Roe, 1982).

# **THE CONTEXT OF HEALTH: ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL FACTORS**

The Shipibo have survived culturally and demographically through hundreds of years of European colonization and missionary activity at the same time that other tribes such as the Cocama have lost their identities and languages

#### **The Context of Health 949**

within the Shipibo culture area. The Shipibo have apparently absorbed other groups such as the Setebo. The population numbers of the Shipibo during precolonial times is not known, but there is evidence that they, like all indigenous Amazonians, experienced catastrophic population losses following European contact due to the introduction of exogenous diseases, armed conflict with European settlers, slavery, and intertribal warfare.

In the mid-1960s, there were approximately 100 Shipibo settlements from Atalaya to Requena, including those found on Ucayali tributaries and interior lakes, comprising a total population of approximately 15,000. In the mid-1980s, there were 125 identifiable Shipibo settlements. The present Shipibo population is estimated to be about 40,000–45,000 in 150 or more settlements, and many Shipibo have moved permanently to larger Mestizo towns such as Pucallpa, which was originally a central Shipibo settlement.

In a baseline health study of the Shipibo village of Paococha in 1969, Hern (1971, 1977) found a population growth rate of 4.9% per year in a carefully defined population of 538. The annual birth rate was 69.3 per thousand, and the death rate was 20.4 per thousand. The difference (69.3/1000 20.4/1000 or 0.0693 0.0204) yields the excess of births over deaths (48.9/1000 population 0.0489) or 4.89% per year. This extremely high population growth rate means that the population doubles approximately every 14.3 years.

In this group, the Total Fertility Rate, which is the sum of age-specific birth rates, was 9.935, which means that the average woman had an average of 10 live births during her reproductive years. This and other measures of fertility showed the Shipibo to have the highest fertility ever recorded in a human group.

It is immediately apparent that this rate of population growth is recent since it would only have taken 90 years for a village the size of Paococha to have supplied the entire contemporary (15,000) Shipibo population, whereas this was only one village. In another perspective, the population growth rate of the Amazon population over the past 10,000 years or so is estimated at approximately 0.1% up until the time of European contact, and Myers estimates that there may have been as many as 10 million indigenous residents of the entire Amazon at the time of European contact (Myers, 1988).

This means that, following a massive population crash during the 16th–19th and early 20th century time span, the Shipibo experienced a rapid population recovery with population growth rates that exceeded precontact rates. In fact, it appears that the most rapid population growth of the Shipibo population occurred in the years immediately following World War II.

At the same time, there has been an aggressive immigration of other Peruvians into the upper Peruvian Amazon. The town of Pucallpa, which was principally a Shipibo settlement in the mid- to late 19th century, contained a Peruvian Mestizo–Criollo population of about 3,500 in 1944. The Trans-Andean "highway" reached Pucallpa at about that time, and immigration from the Andes and the Peruvian coastal cities began, as did increased commercial activities in logging, petroleum exploration, fishing, cattle ranching, and agriculture. The Shipibo were increasingly exposed to sources of rapid cultural change, and they also found themselves competing increasingly with other groups and immigrant populations for the same resources.

Rapid cultural change in the region was enhanced by the establishment in the late 1940s of the Summer Institute of Linguistics, an evangelical Christian group dedicated to translating the Bible into native languages. Their base was built on the shore of Lake Yarinacocha and included a landing strip for the use of the missionary planes as well as establishing a fleet of float planes capable of landing on the waterways and lakes. The missionaries also provided excellent medical care, both preventive and therapeutic, to all indigenous groups with whom they had contact.

Another important influence on both cultural change and the health of the Shipibo was the establishment in 1960 of the Hospital Amazonico (Albert Schweitzer) by Dr. Theodor Binder, a German physician who was dedicated to helping the indigenous people of the Peruvian Amazon. The hospital, located on a high bank overlooking Yarinacocha and near the village of Puerto Callao, was several kilometers upstream from the Summer Institute of Linguistics. This area was separated from Pucallpa by approximately five kilometers of canopy rain forest and an overgrown cacao plantation.

Dr. Binder found the Shipibo in the 1950s to be suffering from a wide variety of infectious and parasitic diseases, with tuberculosis as a major epidemic which was killing many adults. He established the hospital to treat the Shipibo and other indigenous people for free. He also employed Shipibo men in the agriculture and animal husbandry projects that provided the hospital staff and patients with food.

Extensive and intensive contact between the Shipibo and Dr. Binder, along with the rest of his hospital staff and support operation, has been a major source of cultural change for the Shipibo as well as major contribution to their improved health during that time. Shipibo families came from outlying villages to reside at the campsite near the hospital while family members received prolonged treatment for diseases such as tuberculosis and leishmaniasis. More recently, they lived in modest housing constructed by the hospital administration. This contact resulted in exposure to health education but also to European customs and a Spanish-language environment. These families then have taken some of their adopted customs, material culture, and language influences back to the home villages.

Yet another source of cultural change at the village level was the introduction of Western-style schools. These were primarily elementary schools sponsored by missionary groups such as the Seventh-Day Adventists or bilingual schools established by the Summer Institute of Linguistics. Some educational materials included reading and arithmetic, but the curriculum had a heavy emphasis on religious indoctrination and marching around the village plaza or soccer field in a goose-step military fashion. Later, these schools were replaced in all villages by government-sponsored bilingual schools with education levels through high school in some villages. The goosestep, which seems antithetical to the languid cultural ethos of the Shipibo, continues to be the prescribed mode of marching.

The health of the Shipibo has waxed and waned during the past 50 years depending on the availability of vaccination programs, local epidemics, the sporadic availability of altruistic young doctors and nurses, and climatic conditions. A smallpox epidemic swept through the upper Amazon in 1964, killing thousands of indigenous people in hundreds of villages of various tribes. Some local vaccination efforts carried out by missionaries and individuals such as myself protected certain groups from decimation. Both before and after 1964, epidemics of various other contagious diseases such as chickenpox, measles, whooping cough, and polio affected people throughout the region. An epidemic of measles in the upper Pisqui River in the early 1970s killed dozens of Shipibo children before a young German physician, Andreas Kaper, went into the remotest Pisqui villages with vaccine.

Prior to large recent population increases throughout the upper Peruvian Amazon, the Shipibo lived in the presence of spectacularly abundant food sources (Bergman, 1980). A few hours' fishing resulted in more than enough for a large family. Hunting wild game on high ground during the seasonal flood season often resulted in kills of deer, wild boar, tapir, monkeys, large birds, large rodents, and land turtles that provided excellent sources of protein. Gathered and cultivated fruit and vegetables resulted in a highly varied diet rich in vitamins and fiber. General levels of nutrition were excellent.

As regional population levels have increased, the Ucayali fishery has been subjected to great pressure. The town of Pucallpa, which had a population of approximately 3,500 in 1944, was estimated in 2002 to exceed 300,000 in its metropolitan population. The Ucayali is no longer merely the richest freshwater fishery in the world supplying small amounts of fish protein to a few Shipibo settlements living in a subsistence economy. Commercial fishing enterprises use large refrigerator ships with huge drift nets to capture all fish and other organisms 200 km downstream from Pucallpa. The catch not consumed by Pucallpa's growing population is shipped by land to towns on the flanks and high plains of the Andes.

The consequences of the decline in the Ucayali fishery for the Shipibo as well as the complexity of the ecosystem have been dramatic. Whereas a small group of men could leave the village before dawn and return by noon with several canoes full of fish, enough to feed a large extended family in several households for days, a pair of brothers may fish all day now to return at dusk with only a basin full of small fish—enough to feed a nuclear family for one day. The crash in the fish population has been most dramatic during the "mijano"—the upstream fish migration during the dry season months of July and August. In the past, abundant fish caught during this time could be salted, sun-dried, and preserved for weeks or months.

The decline in the fishery has been accompanied by other important changes in the ecology of the Ucayali. Extensive deforestation has resulted in severe changes in the forest climate and river flows. Slash-and-burn agriculture no longer affects small, isolated plots. Large tracts are purposely burned for ranching or cultivation, and large tracts are burned unintentionally and uncontrollably when the forest is exceptionally dry. The desiccation of the forest has accompanied dramatic drops in dry-season rainfall and river levels as local daytime temperatures increase with deforestation. Heavy rains in the wet season are no longer held in the canopy rainforest and its

groundcover. Rapid runoff, erosion, and flooding produce extensive and prolonged inundation downstream that destroys all cultivated crops, domestic animals kept for food, and some forests not adapted to flooding. Wild game is driven deep into the interfluvial forest areas. Fish are hard to find. Nutrition suffers from lack of protein, carbohydrates, and fresh vegetables and fruit that are sources of vitamins. Poisonous spiders, snakes, and scorpions join the household. It is hard to find firewood. Hygiene is next to impossible, and there is no place to bury the dead.

In the dry season, lower water levels mean stagnant, contaminated water in ponds near villages, a higher incidence of gastrointestinal diseases, especially in children, and widespread respiratory diseases due to severe air pollution. Dust storms from the exposed beaches are more common, and this combines with severe smoke density from burning season slash in large plots and burning sawdust at sawmills to produce air that is often unfit to breathe.

The exact impact of these large system changes on overall Shipibo health is difficult to determine with certainty, but it appears that nutritional levels have decreased as a result of intermittent deficiencies in both protein and vitamins. Increasing dependence on a cash economy results in the sale of certain high food value items and produce for money used to purchase lower food value items such as sugar, cooking oil, and polished rice. The physical development of children is now less dependent on traditional activities such as hunting game, paddling canoes, carrying game and produce, and wrestling. Exercise is more dependent on school sports and programmed activities. Soccer is intensely popular and provides excellent cardiovascular exercise but not strength conditioning.

A study of Shipibo infants and children by Hodge and Dufour (1991) showed a tendency in 1984 to lower than normal development and diminished growth rates, especially after the age of 9 months. The authors suggested that mild to moderate protein deficiency malnutrition might be responsible for these growth disturbances. No time-comparison studies of Shipibo child development have been published, but recent unpublished field studies suggest that child development is showing no improvement and may be diminishing.

A study comparing the relative parasite burdens and hemoglobin levels in two radically different Shipibo environments found that people living in the upper reaches of the Pisqui River have much higher burdens of hookworm (*Ancylostoma* sp.), among other things, and lower hemoglobin levels, than Shipibo living on the banks of the Ucayali River (Hern, 1995, unpublished manuscript). In the upper Pisqui, the soil is composed primarily of poorly drained dense, sticky clay, whereas the soil along the Ucayali is principally river sand that is well-drained and quite dry most of the time. Hookworm larvae that penetrate bare feet survive much better in the poorly drained clay soil environment, where it is also somewhat more difficult to dig latrines.

## **MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS**

Several kinds of traditional medical practitioners are recognized among the Shipibo, although the highest and most authentic status is accorded the *muraia*, or "seer." The *muraia* is usually a man who, in addition to his normal activities of fishing, hunting, and tending his chacra, practices the traditional Shipibo healing arts. A principal component of the *muraia*'s method of combating illness is *oni*, otherwise known widely as *aya huasca*, or "dead man's vine." *Oni* is the Shipibo preparation of *banisteria caapi*, a hallucinogenic drug known and used in different forms throughout the Amazon. It is derived from a certain vine that is harvested, cut up into small pieces, and boiled for 8–10 h in order to decoct the alkaloid that is the active hallucinogen. The practitioner takes large gulps of this liquid while entering a healing session (*jonibensuate*) with one or more patients. The songs he sings under the influence of the *oni* help him go into the underworld to fight off the *yushin*, or evil spirit trying to kill both the patient and the *muraia*, and help him summon the *ani yushin*, or great spirit. The *ani yushin* tells the *muraia* which songs ("*huihua*") to sing to heal the patient and where to look for the right herbal remedies.

In addition to singing the healing songs ("*jonibensuatehuihua*"), the *muraia* talks to the patient, sounding very much like a Western psychotherapist, blows smoke over the patient's body, and rustles bundles of dried plants over the affected area. These sessions go on for hours.

Another medical practitioner may be a "curiosa," (Spanish term), or birth attendant who is not trained formally as a midwife. Another Spanish term for such a person is "parteira," or someone who attends "partos" (births). The Shipibo do not seem to have a word of their own for this activity or defined role except as someone who helps with "*bacque picotash*" (birth). This can be just about any adult woman with birth experience herself or who has attended births in the past. Each woman helps her daughters and granddaughters, in particular, and a woman with many daughters and granddaughters may develop an earned reputation as someone with great experience in attending births.

Other practitioners may be informally recognized as men who have special knowledge or experience at setting bones. But orthopedic manipulation and setting fractured bones happens in broad daylight surrounded by the curious as distinguished from the true healing session conducted by the *muraia*, which is sparsely attended and happens very late at night into the early morning hours.

To some extent, all Shipibo are medical practitioners because, at least in the old days, such knowledge of herbal and folk remedies was available to everyone (Arevalo, 1994; Foller, 1990). The exception is the *muraia*, who has both special powers that are earned and ascribed.

For his part, the *muraia* becomes an expert practitioner by fasting, taking the *oni* over long periods of time, learning the sacred songs and when to sing them, and obtaining and controlling the pure vision possible only under the influence of *oni* that is precisely prepared.

In recent decades, a new kind of modern practitioner has appeared, the *sanitario*, or medical corpsman. Some *sanitarios* are well-trained Shipibo men who have relatively good diagnostic and therapeutic skills. Some non-Shipibo *sanitarios* sent by the Peruvian government have variable skills, but none of the *sanitarios* have had much to work with in the way of medical supplies, vaccines, or instruments.

The *sanitarios* sometimes play critical roles in the prevention and management of epidemic disease as in the case of the cholera epidemics of the 1990s and in vaccination programs. But missteps occur as new technologies are applied. In one instance, a poorly trained Shipibo *sanitario* decided to perform a needle aspiration of an abscess that he perceived in the umbilicus of an elderly woman, who had a little occasional discomfort in the bulging spot. She subsequently developed diffuse abdominal tenderness, which was diagnosed as peritonitis by a Western medical practitioner. The umbilical bulge was a herniation of a loop of small bowel that had been punctured by the *sanitario*'s needle.

# **CLASSIFICATION OF ILLNESS, THEORIES OF ILLNESS, AND TREATMENT OF ILLNESS**

The Shipibo are practical people who live in a complex, dynamic, and potentially hazardous environment in which injuries and death can and often do occur quickly. Traumatic injuries such as snakebite, puncture wounds, fractures, burns, lacerations, sting ray wounds, bites by carnivorous fish and alligators, insect stings, accidental gunshot, and allergic contact with known poisonous plants are obvious sources of suffering and death for the Shipibo. They have innumerable herbal remedies (*rao*) for these injuries, and some of them work amazingly well. The Shipibo are generally, it seems, incredibly resistant to a wide variety of pathogens that would fell the average person of European descent almost instantly.

The Shipibo have a certain working knowledge of what Europeans would call comparative anatomy and physiology since they dissect animals of all kinds in the process of food preparation. They know, for example, that there are embryos and fetuses in the uteri of various female animals that they kill such as tapirs, wild boars, and monkeys and that these features are not found in male animals.

On the other hand, internal illnesses and conditions without obvious origins such as fevers, paralysis, birth defects, and difficult deliveries are traditionally ascribed to conditions in the spirit world. In particular, the condition of *cupia* is widely attributed as a cause for various ailments, and the term for experiencing a variety of *cupia* is *cutipado*. The first term may be an original Shipibo word, but the latter is the grammatically Spanish past participle of the verb, *cutipar*, which may be a Spanish adaptation of a Shipibo concept. It is a widely used expression throughout the Peruvian Amazon. In any case, *cutipado* roughly corresponds to "bewitched" in English, and *cupia* is a kind of instant explanation for an otherwise inscrutable condition or illness experience. A child who is albino or who is exceptionally light-skinned, but normal in all other respects, may be said to be *cutipado*. This characterization is also a useful deflection of potentially inconvenient questions about why the individual looks so different from his or her siblings or cousins.

If, for example, a woman is pregnant, there are certain foods she may or may not eat and certain acts she

#### **Sexuality and Reproduction 953**

may not commit at certain times such as sexual intercourse. If she violates these restrictions, she may experience *cupia* or said to be *cutipado*, (Alvarez, 1990) a part of which is the process of being visited by and having sexual intercourse with a river porpoise or dolphin during the night. This state becomes the obvious post-hoc explanation for a difficult delivery, a stillbirth, delivery of a deformed child, death of the woman during childbirth, hemorrhage following childbirth, lack of breast milk, etc.

If a man kills a cayman (*Caiman sclerops*, variety of alligator found on the Ucayali), dolphin, or certain other animals, or if he cuts down a tree such as a lupuna that is sacred, he also may be *cutipado*, which is the obvious explanation for his prolonged inexplicable illness in which he experiences severe abdominal pain, headache, malaise, convulsions, or jaundice and dies an agonizing death. It could also be that he simply offended someone, who arranged for him to be *cutipado*.

A young woman who is *cutipado* may experience a dissociative, hysterical episode during which she is obviously out of control, having seizures, screaming, shaking, clenching her teeth, sweating, moaning, and beyond any social interaction. These episodes, which are uncommon, may go on for long periods of time up to an hour. In such a case, she has clearly been *cutipado* by an enemy, perhaps a social or sexual rival, with the help of someone who practices *brujeria* (Spanish for witchcraft). The person who practices black magic (*magica negra*) casts a spell (*cupia*) on the person who then experiences the dissociative state, which does not in any way resemble what is known in Western medicine as an epileptic seizure. I have observed these behaviors (with similar explanations) in other indigenous societies in Latin America.

## **SEXUALITY AND REPRODUCTION**

The Shipibo like sex and are sometimes quite open about it, particularly in joking relationships. They love obscene and intimate sexual humor, especially when there is a cover of darkness to obscure the speaker (even though everyone knows from the voice who is speaking). Whether it is under the influence of Christian missionaries or reflects traditional Shipibo custom, sexuality is not flaunted or openly recognized during the day and in the midst of communal activities. Young people court and disappear into the bush. Although there is no formal marriage ceremony, young couples who are recognized as "newlyweds" are indulged as they spend long hours under the mosquito net together, even during the day. The young man is then likely to be ribbed mercilessly by his age-mates about his consequent alleged weakness and incapacity for any useful work. Most sexual activity, however, seems to occur in a more furtive fashion as husbands and wives bathe together in the river at dusk and meet secretively in a remote section of the *chacra*, or garden, distant from the village. It is customary for whole families to sleep under one mosquito net. Sexual activity between spouses occurs during the night under the family mosquito net when the children are asleep.

Shipibo women have a wide variety of herbal remedies that are thought to control reproduction. The general category of these remedies is *to-otirao* (pregnancy *tooti*, and medicine *rao* or "rau"). A kind of *tootirao* is taken in order to become pregnant.

Remedies to prevent pregnancy are more common. The most commonly known *tootimarao* (*ma* negative) is *tootimahuaste. Tootimahuaste* is a grass-like plant (probably a sedge) that grows on the shores of a lake (*huaste* herb). It is pounded and the juice squeezed into a cup of hot water. This tea is taken the first three days of two successive menstrual periods. This is alleged to result in permanent sterility.

*Tootirao* works by making the *baquenanuti* (uterus) moist, lush, and receptive to the seed of the man. *Tootimarao* works in the opposite way: by making the inside of the *bacquenanuti* hard, dry, and unreceptive to the male's seed.

Failing to observe the prescribed pregnant woman's diet or behavior restrictions may result in *cupia* and a complicated pregnancy in which the woman dies, suffers a stillbirth, or gives birth to a deformed baby.

In spite of the widespread knowledge and use of herbal contraceptives (Hern, 1976), fertility has been exceptionally high among Shipibo women. A possible explanation for this paradox is that the prescribed dietary/behavior regimen that accompanies the use of herbal contraceptives includes sexual abstinence. In epidemiology, a lack of pregnancy under these circumstances of herbal contraceptive use would be called a "secondary non-causal association."

Women living in monogamous, as distinguished from polygynous relationships, find it hard to observe a period of sexual abstinence. A later study of the relationships between polygyny and fertility showed that polygynous women had longer birth intervals and fewer pregnancies. Further, the measured community fertility rate had a straight-line negative relationship to the level of polygyny practiced in a particular village. The less polygyny, the higher the community fertility rate, and vice versa (Hern, 1988, 1990, 1992a, 1992b).

In a traditional family, sororal polygyny (in which all co-wives are sisters) is the preferred and prevailing family structure. In this setting, women are able to observe postpartum sexual abstinence for longer periods of time than women who are in monogamous unions. Births are fewer with more time between them. This has a positive effect on the health of both mothers and children.

The change from polygyny to monogamy began with the first contact with Christian missionaries. Polygyny is still severely criticized by Christian missionaries, and in one well-known instance, a disapproving official Peruvian census taker would not count members of polygynous families. The extremely high fertility and high rates of population growth that have been found in Shipibo communities are at least partly due to cultural change with a disruption of patterns that dampened fertility.

Although the Shipibo treat children with a great deal of gentle affection, they do not express any desire for more than two or three children. The rare woman who is infertile or subfecund is regarded as unfortunate, but not tragically so. Such women and their partners readily adopt children from other households, and the children have two homes and families, almost always harmonious.

The Shipibo express vague concern and unease about population growth as they see it directly affecting their daily lives. There are a bewildering number of children needing school classrooms and teachers, more each year, and there are increasingly scarce resources. But they do not see how they can influence events, especially the growth and intrusion of large population groups from outside the village. *Estaremos aplastado por los nahuabo*—"We will be squashed (and wiped out) by the (non-Shipibo)."

## **HEALTH THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE**

### **Pregnancy and Birth**

Young Shipibo women learn about pregnancy and birth from close observation of their mothers, sisters, aunts, and cousins. Traditionally, the young woman has her first menarche at the age of 12 or 13. She has her first sexual experience and perhaps a permanent partner at 13 or 14, and has her first baby by age 15.

One type of herbal contraceptive is called *navashuaste*, which is taken by young women in order to postpone pregnancy instead of causing permanent sterility, the effect sought by taking *tootimahuaste*. There is no evidence that the use of *navashuaste* for this purpose is successful.

When a woman is pregnant, she must observe certain dietary laws and taboos that restrict activity and foods. She must not be subjected to a frightening experience such as encountering a snake or other wild animal.

Spontaneous abortions occur, but they are uncommon and accepted as a matter of fact. The term for a spontaneous abortion is *bacquencahuana* (literally "baby falls out"). Twins are rare but do occur. Induced abortion is almost unknown.

Birth occurs in the woman's home, and she is usually attended by her mother and/or close female relatives in the same age range as the woman's mother. A young woman may be surrounded by all the women neighbors in the case of a difficult delivery. Freely offered folk advice from this gathering of interested spectators is accompanied during labor contractions by a frantic chorus of "Push!…Push!…Push!"

After delivery, the placenta is usually buried under the woman's house.

### **Infancy**

Newborn infants are not given a name until one or more months of age. The Shipibo name (*janecon*, "true name") is given first, although a Spanish name with paternal and maternal surnames may be given for birth registry. The reason for the delay in naming is the recognition of a high probability of neonatal death.

Newborn infants are traditionally painted with *huito*, a black vegetable dye (*Genipa* sp.), with their faces painted in a typical geometric Shipibo design. The explanation for the face painting is that the design wards off the *yushin*, or evil spirit that causes illness and death. It also looks nice. There is no distinction between painting a thing or person with designs to protect it from evil spirits or just for fun.

Shipibo children are engulfed in love from their first moments and are highly indulged by both parents. Children are breast-fed for at least 6 months, and complete weaning may not occur for several years.

#### **Health through the Life Cycle 955**

Infants are carried on the hip in a shawl tied around the mother's neck as she goes about her various chores. Very young infants sleep during the day in a covered hammock that is watched by a grandparent, sibling, or other relative who may be sitting nearby performing such tasks as weaving and potting.

In the past, a multiple birth resulted in one twin being killed by suffocation, as was the case of a severely deformed infant. This practice appears to have been abandoned, especially for twins.

All children receive close supervision and attention from a variety of adults, but particularly the child's mother and the mother's immediate relatives. This is true for both healthy and sick infants. The child of a woman who has deficient or no breast milk is nursed by a female relative who is lactating.

When infants are weaned, they are given increasing amounts of stewed ripe mashed plantains, a preparation that has the consistency of liquid oatmeal. Unfortunately, the mother may add raw river water that is heavily contaminated with human feces to this otherwise healthful preparation. As an obvious result, between 10–40% of children in some villages die of gastrointestinal ailments before they reach one year of age.

### **Childhood**

Young children up to the age of 10–12 are given great freedom to play with their peers and to explore the area around the house and village. They frequently accompany their parents or other adults on excursions such as going to the garden to cultivate or gather food, or, in the case of boys, to hunt and fish with their fathers.

Shipibo children begin learning the complex family relationships including kinship terms and avoidance patterns at a very early age (Abelove, 1978). A Shipibo child's social success is highly correlated with its mother's pattern of interactions with others.

Child abandonment is almost unknown. It is inconceivable to the Shipibo. "Only mestizos abandon their children." Discipline is gentle and consists principally of quiet talking and persuasion. Once in a while, a parent will spank a young child. A parent may gently scold or, rarely, have an angry exchange with an ill-behaved older child, but it does not appear that the physical abuse of children occurs among the Shipibo.

Sick children are given round-the-clock nursing care, and those with chronic illnesses are given special support, such as having someone specifically assigned to help that impaired person.

### **Adolescence**

Although traditional patterns are changing rapidly with the introduction of formal schools through the high school level, Shipibo adolescents still assume many adult responsibilities that include subsistence activities and mating. Informal trial marriages occur with an adolescent couple cohabiting in the girl's parents' house, and these are generally regarded as temporary arrangements. If the girl becomes pregnant, however, a more stable relationship is likely to emerge.

### **Adulthood**

In the absence of formal Western schools, Shipibo girls entered permanent sexual relationships at the age of 13 or 14 and immediately began having children. They were considered adults from that point on. Currently, girls are encouraged to attend school at least through grade school and beyond if possible. Sexual encounters occur, but adolescent cohabitation in the traditional patterns occurs much less than it did before the introduction of schools.

Once a nuclear family is established, the young husband builds a house for his own family, typically in the family compound or immediately adjacent to the home of the woman's parents. A separate structure containing the hearth and eating area is usually a few meters from the house. In the case of polygynous marriages, each woman may have her own house and hearth.

People over 40 years of age are considered "old" since life expectancy is under 50 for women and not much past 50 for men.

### **The Aged**

People who are very old—those who reach the age of 70 or 80—are treated with great respect and veneration. An elderly adult woman suffering from tuberculosis, for example, is given her own hut next to the main family house, and young children are assigned to help her in every way. Her food is brought to her and she is accompanied to the lake or river for bathing.

Tuberculosis is a major killer of mature and elderly adults among the Shipibo—those who have the most knowledge of the ancient traditions, songs, and secrets of the forest. An inordinate number of Shipibo women die from cervical cancer.

Although autopsy studies are not possible, it appears that some adults die from the effects of migration of certain ingested parasites to vital organs such as the brain and liver.

As death approaches a very sick person, family members, mostly women, gather around the person who is *isin* (sick) and offer whatever support they can. This is especially true for a very elderly person with many progeny and other relatives. When the person expires, the gathered kin begin wailing a melancholy falsetto falling scale in a minor key spanning about an octave. This pattern is repeated over and over, with the high notes sometimes sustained to express the intense grief. It is a penetrating and unmistakable sound that carries far, especially over large expanses of water, and it communicates the loss to all within hearing range.

The deceased is typically laid out on a table, if a child, or on a mat on the ground under the kitchen roof. Candles are sometimes placed at the head and feet, a custom that may be Catholic in origin. Friends come to pay their respects, sit quietly for awhile, perhaps wailing, then leave, offering a few words of consolation to the survivors.

Adults are placed in an old canoe, which is covered with sawn boards, and the body is buried in the village cemetery. Infants and children are placed either in a child's canoe or in half of an adult canoe. Everyone takes turns throwing dirt onto the casket as the grave is filled.

Funerary jars uncovered by erosion at an ancient settlement that surely predated European contact indicates that deceased individuals were buried in very large pots at that time.

The custom of close contact with those who are ill, including the sharing of drinking and eating vessels, contributed to high Shipibo mortality during a cholera epidemic on the Pisqui and Ucayali in 1990–91. Whole families died within hours of each other.

When an adult man dies, his house is burned down with all his possessions. His widow crops her hair and dresses in black for one year. The possessions of a woman who dies are burned, but not the house in which she lived.

At the end of one year, a funeral wake is held and marks the end of the mourning period.

The Shipibo have a proverb that helps them cope with constant death and loss among their families and friends: *Huinata jahuequi moa shinantima*—"We no longer think about the things that are so sad they make us cry."
