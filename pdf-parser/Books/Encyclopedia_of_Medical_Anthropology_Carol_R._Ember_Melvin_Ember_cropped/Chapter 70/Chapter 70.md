illnesses (due to prolonged use of cigarettes or pipe tobacco), diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, blood pressure, and hearing and vision loss. Women also suffer from back problems stemming from lifting heavy loads and gynecological problems. Owing to poor dental hygiene, both older men and women have very poor oral health. As much as half of the elderly are chronically ill. The elderly are taken care of by family members. Their generation relies primarily on religio-medical healing and herbal treatment.

#### **Dying and Death**

Death is distressing for most Garhwali. The entire lineage, and sometimes the whole village, is in a state of mourning. High levels of emotion are expressed in private and in public. The body is taken to the cremation site in a procession. Family members take the clothes off the body and apply purified butter and sandalwood paste to the body. The body is then cremated in the presence of male members of the family, relatives, and community. The bone remains and the ashes are thrown into the river. After the cremation, an elaborate ritual ceremony lasts for more than 11 days. During these days, the family and the lineage of the dead are considered polluted and do not attend any celebrations. On the last day, relatives and members of the community are invited for a feast. Because Garhwali believe in ancestral worship, the dead are treated with special reverence. They also believe that the dead could be reincarnated in human or animal form.

## **CHANGING HEALTH PATTERNS**

Like anywhere else in the world, changes are taking place in the Garhwal region. While there is an increased use of biomedicine, there is a gradual loss of traditional healing practices and resources. Owing to exposure to the outside world, the Garhwali beliefs about disease causation are consistently changing from supernatural to natural causes. Women are becoming more aware of their health problems and seeking more healthcare services. With increasing contact with outsiders, Garhwali are also contracting new infectious diseases including sexually transmitted diseases. At this time, there is not much knowledge and awareness among Garhwali about the threats of HIV/AIDS.

# **Garifuna**

#### **Nancie L. González and Gloria Castillo**

### **ALTERNATIVE NAMES**

*Garifuna*, which is actually an adjective, is the term now preferred by the people themselves, and most widely used, but until the 1970s they were more often known in anthropological and travel literature as *Black Caribs*, and as *Morenos* (*Dark Ones*) to their compatriots of other ethnicities. When speaking their own language, however, the correct usage is "(we) the *Garinagu*," which derives from Arawakan *Kalinago*.

### **LOCATION AND LINGUISTIC AFFILIATION**

The Caribbean coastline of Central America, extending from Belize to Nicaragua, has been home to the Garifuna since 1797 when the British forcibly transported them there from the island of St Vincent in the Lesser Antilles (González, 1988). Their phenotype reveals their African heritage, but their language, culture, and genotype demonstrate that they are a hybrid people, with both African and (South) Amerindian roots (Crawford & González, 1981; Taylor, 1955). The people encountered by the first Europeans in the Caribbean became known as Caribs, and the language family widely spoken there and in the tropical forests of South America, as *Carib*. The term is probably a corruption of *Galibi*. By the middle of the 18th century, after numbers of enslaved Africans had arrived—by capture or through flight—on St Vincent, the term Black Carib was coined to refer to the population darkened by intermixture.

Ironically, the language, still spoken today by perhaps 75% of all Garifuna, is not of the Cariban, but of the Arawakan family—also originating in South America. Despite some allegations to the contrary, it does not contain more than a few possible words of African origin (Taylor, 1952; Taylor & Hoff, 1980). It seems that it was important for this new group to hide and deny their African roots, at least at first, in order to escape recapture by Europeans. In time, the Amerindian culture that had received and nurtured them became theirs. However, both the people and their culture were further "Africanized" through continued contacts with other African people, especially after 1763, when the British seized the island and began major sugar cultivation, importing large numbers of African slaves as laborers.

### **OVERVIEW OF THE CULTURE**

Subsistence fishing and the cultivation of cassava, yams, rice, plantains, and various other crops have been the basis of the economy and the diet for centuries. However, even on St Vincent there is evidence that the Garifuna learned to desire some European foods and goods, and were willing to do migrant wage labor in order to obtain them. In Central America this practice escalated into what became a full-time endeavor for many men, and a parttime experience for most. Increasingly the men remained away for longer periods during their mature years, and although their sense of belonging to their home villages remained strong, their women, by default, took over the roles of parent/provider/protector/disciplinarian/guardian of ritual/ and more (Kerns, 1983).

Since the 1960s, however, more and more women have also chosen to emigrate—primarily to the United States, where they either join their men, or make their way independently. As more Garifuna are born in the U.S. and benefit from the educational opportunities there, the diaspora has enlarged, become more dispersed, and changed its character. Many Garifuna are now well educated, reasonably affluent, and are truly transnational in their outlooks. Some, having achieved a comfortable seniority, have chosen to retire to their original villages, where they live in such relative affluence, that it sometimes makes them targets of unkind gossip, and a certain alienation. Others, having experienced such, give up and return to the United States.

Among these expatriates are some who rue the loss of what they still define as "their" culture, and they have organized several mechanisms for retaining, rehabilitating, and reeducating themselves and the world at large as to their origins and their ethnicity. Belizean Garifuna, both at home and abroad, have been especially active in this, and one of their successes has been the May 2001 United Nations proclamation of the Garifuna culture as "Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity."

The growth of international tourism has directly affected the Garifuna, whose culture is seen as deliciously exotic by nearly everyone. This has, no doubt, helped to slow out-migration as individuals and villages struggle to organize themselves to receive and entertain visitors from abroad. This has had both beneficial and negative impacts on health. Although providing some cash income, it has also brought new diseases, drugs, and prostitution.

#### **The Sources of Garifuna Ethnic and Political Identity**

The symbols of ethnicity for the Garifuna, wherever they happen to live, are language, indigenous spiritual beliefs and practices, and increasingly, what they believe to have been a forgotten and buried African past. Although they see themselves as different from other African-derived peoples whom they encounter in the United States, there are good reasons for them to identify their culture as a variant of African, rather than North Amerindian, culture. It is difficult to have it both ways, so today's Garifuna increasingly cling to the African component of their heritage. They are witness to the success of the civil rights movement in the United States, as well as to the developing awareness on the part of Latin American "Blacks" of the discrimination against people of their color.

#### **Spiritual Life**

Traditional Garifuna religion focused attention of the living on the deceased—both ancestors and the spirits of the many children who died young. The former were believed to be either benevolent or malevolent, depending upon the relations one had with them in life, and on how well they are attended to ritually after death. Spiritual guides or shamans, called *buwiyes*, are capable of communicating with these spirits, often using as helpers the spirits of dead children, many of whom seek to be born again to their mothers. Although conversion to Roman Catholicism occurred for many on St Vincent, and for most others during the early years in Central America, it is rare to find a Garifuna today who does not harbor beliefs in the reality and the power of the spirits of their own relatives (Foster, 1982; Howland, 1984). Rituals to honor and placate the dead occur apart from, but in conjunction with Catholic masses, and enlightened Catholic priests close their eyes to what some might think of as blasphemy.

# **THE CONTEXT OF HEALTH: ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL FACTORS**

#### **Overview**

There exist no precise figures on how many Garifuna there are, either in the world as a whole, or in Central America. Davidson (1979) estimated that there were about 60,000–70,000 in Central America in the 1970s; estimates given by the senior author for Honduras alone suggested a figure of 100,000 in 2000. Guatemala has less than 10,000 today, Belize perhaps 20,000, and Nicaragua less than 5,000. Due to permanent out-migration and developing transnationalism, the population is difficult to estimate, and is probably diminishing in Central America, while it grows in the United States. No one doubts that there are more Garifunas living full or parttime in the United States than in all of Central America today. Because of this wide dispersion, with people living in any one of five different countries, it is impossible to do more than make guesses about this and about mortality and morbidity rates.

Probably the most significant health problem today is AIDS, but other venereal diseases, cardiovascular problems, viral respiratory illnesses, and diabetes have plagued those in Central America for generations. Because of the relatively high frequency of the sickle cell gene, homozygotes suffer sicklemia and its consequences, while heterozygotes enjoy resistance to malaria. (Crawford, 1984; González et al., 1965).

#### **Environment**

The Caribbean coastline of Central America is hot, humid, and has long been considered unhealthy by Europeans, primarily because of their susceptibility to the fevers that were endemic in the area until the middle of the 20th century. The Garifuna flourished there, both because of their resistance to malaria, and because they were pre-adapted to the tropics. They knew how to build their houses so as to catch the sea breeze, and to stay out of the sun during the height of the day, and they knew how to harvest the natural resources. Most importantly, they were excellent seafarers (McKusick, 1960; Nicholson, 1976).

Wild palms and other fibrous plants provided raw materials for their traditional baskets, fish traps, mats, hammocks, cassava presses and sifters, and roof thatching. An abundance of hardwoods was available for manufacturing canoes and other wooden implements, such as cassava-graters. Houses were made of reeds, wattle and daub, or palm boards, although cement blocks and lumber are increasingly used today.

Citrus, avocado, mango, and other tropical fruit trees adorn every village and most home sites. The oil-bearing "milk" extracted from the fruit of the coconut palm is a major ingredient in their cuisine, a primary source of cholesterol. Fish and shellfish such as shrimps, lobsters, and crabs, were easily caught using nets and traps. At one time the men also did some hunting in the interior, but this was never so important as the harvests of seafood. Chickens

#### **The Context of Health 675**

and pigs were introduced while still on St Vincent, and their meat continues to be appreciated, although fish is still preferred. Cows and goats are rare. Upland (dry) rice, beans, and plantains became important after they reached Central America. Unlike the indigenous people of the interior, they prefer bread and tortillas made of refined wheat flour rather than of maize.

In recent decades their healthy traditional diet has deteriorated, due to several interactive factors, including the out-migration of both women and men during their most productive years, the loss of lands suitable for horticulture, the rise of commercial fishing enterprises that seriously affect the availability of fish and shellfish in local waters, the influence of television and other advertising for processed, often "junk" foods, and the scarcity of cash to buy foods that were once locally produced.

#### **Economic Factors**

The coastal location was also important for the opportunities it afforded the men to seek employment among the increasing numbers of foreign explorers, casual travelers, missionaries, and would-be settlers arriving in the area after the 1821 independence. Even before that time they earned a reputation for being skilled, valiant mercenary soldiers, serving both government and rebel leaders. Concomitantly, the women, who were the chief agricultural producers, found markets among the same people.

At first the men traveled only on occasion, providing transport for both people and goods in their large seaworthy canoes, and as stevedores loading and unloading ships in the several ports. In Belize and Honduras they cut mahogany and dyewood, and in Guatemala they helped with the construction of buildings in the ill-fated colony of Santo Tomás (Blondeel Van Cuelebrouk, 1846). The migration gradually became more intense, some men traveling daily or weekly to and from their villages, others working seasonally, and still others virtually disappearing for months or years at a time. In the early 20th century they began working on ships carrying fruit—especially bananas—to the United States, and many elected to stay on there, working first on the docks in ports such as New Orleans, Mobile, and New York. Later, many signed on as seamen, cooks, or waiters on ocean liners (Sherar, 1973).

Women began to emigrate in large numbers in the 1960s. Small children were left with their grandmothers, and the households, which formerly contained three generations of related women and their children, were increasingly composed primarily of only two—the middle generation living abroad (González, 1984). Emigrants originally sent money to care for both the children and the elderly, but too often the amounts were insufficient to provide what is needed for optimum health and wellbeing. Many Garifuna leaders have long recognized this problem, but there is no simple solution. The United States has not always offered the easy and inexpensive life that many expected, and as many emigrants are undocumented visitors, they must accept the lowest paying jobs and cannot take advantage of government sponsored assistance programs. Thus, they often do not have sufficient resources to share with those at home.

#### **Social Factors**

Garifuna society has long been characterized as "matrifocal," meaning that women are prevalent and influential, especially in household and village affairs, and in maintaining ritual and other traditions (Kerns, 1983). Households are consanguineally based, centered on a group of related women and their children (González, 1970). This stems from two circumstances. First, there were only 496 men, 547 women, and 422 children upon arrival in Trujillo, Honduras in 1797 (González, 1988). None of the children were under three years of age, which meant that virtually every woman of childbearing age was at risk of pregnancy. High fertility would have been expected and desired under these demographic circumstances. Second, as described above, the out-migration of men became more frequent, and because their return and length of stay were always uncertain, mother–daughter households became the norm. Polygyny had been customary on St Vincent (Helms, 1981), and in Central America this developed into a system of serial monogamy for the women as various men came and went in their lives, while the men had temporary or lasting common-law wives in more than one village. The resulting pattern, which condoned multiple partners for the men, brittle unions, and the right of the woman to seek new partners as old ones disappeared, was beneficial in increasing fertility and in maximizing a woman's ability to seek men who would be economically successful and supportive of her household (Brown, 1975; McCommon, 1982). It also contributed to widespread venereal diseases, and to difficulties in gender or psychological differentiation for the men (González, 1979; Mertz, 1977).

#### **Political Factors**

The Garifuna have until recently lived virtually outside the framework of national politics in Central America, although the circumstances have varied from country to country. In part, this was because they lived in relatively isolated villages on a sparsely settled coastline that others eschewed. They are readily identifiable by their color, their accents when speaking the dominant language, and by other cultural characteristics. Despite the fact that the general populations of both Honduras and Belize include a strong component of genes from Africa, the Garifuna are looked down upon, even by others with similar racial characteristics. In Guatemala, which has a much smaller "Black" population, they are feared and despised by the indigenous people, and either ignored by the others or appreciated only for their singing, dancing, and sexual prowess. Ladinos have nearly always held the important local offices, and as a class, hold a higher social position than Garifuna of comparable economic and educational status.

The Garifuna did not participate actively in Guatemala's civil violence (1964–98), but the peace agreement of 1998, in promising to better the human and civil rights of minority peoples, specifically mentions the Garifuna as one of the beneficiary groups. This has helped politicize those still living in the country, and many have left the coast to attend university level courses in the capital city. Formerly this had been a career path open to and chosen by only a handful of others. Although basic literacy and fluency in a second language are nearly universal today, many cannot do advanced academic work owing to poor preparation—itself the result of poor schools, inattention to studying at lower levels, lack of discipline, and expectations of emigration.

Politicization of Garifuna in Belize and Honduras began earlier, and although they do not vote as a minority block in either country, they are taking various actions to make their concerns known and addressed by the national governments. In this, they have been assisted by the United Nations and other organizations that bring together indigenous peoples of the world to share their concerns, ideas, and agendas.

Above the level of the extended family women wield considerable influence, but little political power. Only in Belize have women achieved public office at the national level, and that occurred more often a generation ago than now. New organizations aimed at strengthening ethnic solidarity and pride are dominated by men, and women are now more often relegated to serving as secretaries and as spokespersons for the leaders.

### **MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS**

In the villages now and previously, formal biomedical assistance is rare. The elders, as always, are a source of information on home cures, some of them based upon purchased remedies such as paregoric, aspirin, cough medicine, and even antibiotics, the latter, like most medicines, being available without medical prescriptions. In choosing these they may be advised by pharmacists, if there are such. Some villages have government-run clinics, which are consulted as a last resort. Traditional curers, who may be either men or women, include herbalists and diviners, as well as buwiyes. The latter are thought to have innate abilities and to be "called" to their profession, after which they undergo lengthy training with a practicing buwiye. As discussed below, they are usually consulted after home remedies are exhausted, or if the illness is suspected of having a supernatural cause (Cohen, 1984; Staiano, 1981).

A few Garifuna, including the second author, have taken university degrees in medicine, but they rarely practice in their home villages. Some have studied pharmacy, medicine or nursing at different levels in the United States, but they also have, in effect, left their traditional culture and people, and practice in cities. It is not known what percentage of their patients, if any, is Garifuna.

# **CLASSIFICATION OF ILLNESS, THEORIES OF ILLNESS, AND TREATMENT OF ILLNESS**

Western (Hippocratic) medical ideas were first introduced by French missionaries in St Vincent in the 17th century, but these were of a pre-biomedical character, and became part of what is thought of today as traditional, or prescientific medicine. This lore included many or most of the medicinal plants still in use (Cosminsky, 1976), as well as concepts concerning "hot" and "cold" conditions of food and the body, "humors" and so on (Sanford, 1976).

Diseases and illnesses are classified according to whether they result from natural or supernatural causes. The former are often susceptible to treatment with home

#### **Health through the Life Cycle 677**

remedies, including both herbal and chemical agents. Some of these are traditional, others recent introductions through biomedicine. If, however, the condition is not relieved, or if it returns frequently, a biomedical doctor may be consulted. If the symptoms persist, suspicion grows that either some living person has used obeah, or "black magic" against the patient, or that a deceased ancestor is feeling neglected and seeking to punish the sick one and to goad him or her into sponsoring one of several different rituals. All of these begin with a mass in the local Catholic church, and continue, either in the patient's home, or in the case of the more elaborate ceremonies, in a special sanctuary reserved for such occasions.

But before a ceremony is prescribed, either a diviner or a buwiye may be consulted merely to advise as to the cause and the cure. As such, the buwiye is both priest and physician. In his latter role he or she may use a variety of techniques, some of ancient Arawakan origin, such as blowing tobacco smoke or aguardiente over the patient, or using ventriloquism to suggest the voices of spirits talking from the rafters (Glazier, 1980; Taylor, 1951). The buwiye's knowledge and rituals have undergone modification over the past generation, largely through interactions with other Caribbean peoples in the United States, and probably stem from one or another African culture.

If a ceremony to placate an ancestor is prescribed and the patient does not comply, psychological consequences may ensue. The sick one may experience dreams in which the ancestor first beseeches, and later threatens to do even more harm if he or she is not bathed, or fed. The duration of a ceremony varies, but the activities always include drumming, singing, and dancing, and the offering of favorite foods to the deceased. It is expected that one or another participant will experience "possession," a state of trance in which the spirit of an ancestor speaks to the congregation, offering advice, and information (González, 1995; Goodman et al., 1974; Howland, 1984).

In addition to seeking supernatural remedies for those illnesses caused by spirits, Garifuna may also seek help from their ancestors through the buwiye to address diseases such as cancer, for symptoms of mental distress, or for any other condition of unknown or misunderstood etiology. This compares with the use of prayers to various gods in other societies (González, 1966). Garifuna see no conflict between their primarily Catholic faith and the ritual honoring of their ancestors. Indeed, over the past generation more and more Christian elements have been included in the latter (González, 1963, 1966, 1988).

### **SEXUALITY AND REPRODUCTION**

Garifuna have a reputation in Central America for what is perceived by others as promiscuous, guiltless, sexual freedom for both sexes. This has led, over the years, to the higher fertility mentioned above—a necessary element for survival of the group. Their reputation for sexual prowess has brought many European and American women tourists to the area seeking new experiences with the younger men. Some of these have taken their lovers home with them—a possibility that has made such encounters attractive for many men. Male tourists also seek partners—among both men and women, and sometimes these have led to lengthy liasions.

Among themselves, heterosexual unions, whether permanent or fleeting, have long been the norm, but modernity and gay tourism have brought out what may have long been an unconscious homosexuality in some men. Psychologists may attribute this in part to matrifocality, which has penetrated the culture, as well as the household structure, in many ways (González, 1979; McCommon, 1982; Mertz, 1977; Munroe & Munroe, 1971; Sanford, 1976).

Children are desired by both women and men, the latter because they offer proof of their virility, even when they are otherwise disconnected from both the mother and the child. Women desire children to validate their femininity and maturity, and in an effort to tie the father(s) to them and their household, even though this is not always the result. Having children by more than one man increases the number of possible sources of income and other assistance, not only from the various fathers, but from the grandparents as well (González, 1969, 1988; McCommon, 1982). Beliefs about the afterlife also give impetus to reproduction, for to die without issue means that there will be no one to remember and care for one in the spirit world.

### **HEALTH THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE**

#### **Pregnancy and Birth**

Birthing in the villages usually occurs at home, assisted by a midwife, but in cities hospital or clinic births are preferred. Latin American food taboos related to hot and cold apply during pregnancy and the postpartum period, during which the mother is urged to rest, preferably in bed, for 40 days. The placenta is buried, in earlier times in the floor of the house, but the amniotic sac, after careful examination for what it may reveal of the child's character, is dried, then wrapped in a red or black cloth to protect it and the child from evil spirits or living enemies (Idiáquez, 1982). The stump of the cord is also dried, preserved, and may be used for medicinal purposes during the child's lifetime.

The couvade appears to be an ancient, probably Arawakan, custom (Riviere, 1974), of which there are only traces today (Coehlo, 1949; Kerns, 1976; Munroe & Munroe, 1971; Munroe et al., 1973; Taylor, 1950). Fathers are still said to suffer some of the symptoms of pregnancy, such as nausea and labor pains, and they are advised to refrain from certain activities and foods, as well as sexual relations with other women, so as not to endanger the fetus.

Abortions are usually termed miscarriages, and both occur with some frequency. Many of them are never reported to authorities, so there is little information concerning them, but recent observations by the second author suggest they are now increasing, especially among younger women. Most women will admit to having lost children, either before or after birth. Stillbirths also occur with some frequency, for unknown reasons.

#### **Infancy**

Children are breast-fed, supplemented almost from birth with a pap made of manioc starch. Unfortunately, although this is thought to be especially nourishing, it provides only calories and tends to suppress the amount of breast-milk, leading to early weaning—often after only a few months, although many continue up to 2 years. The broths from boiling either meat or black beans, with bread, are offered after about 6 months, and the mother will premasticate other foods before offering them to a child without many teeth (González, 1963; Jenkins, 1984).

Respiratory and intestinal illnesses, exacerbated by undernutrition, are two of the most common ailments of childhood. Vaccinations against the common childhood diseases are available through government clinics, and most children are so protected. Still, infant mortality is relatively high in the villages, where biomedical assistance is not always available. Sickle-cell disease may also contribute to many early infant deaths. Protection against the evil eye and other malevolent dangers includes painting blue crosses upon the forehead, and the wearing of amulets containing various charms.

### **Childhood**

Children are cared for primarily by women—the mother, grandmother, older sisters, and aunts—but men who may be resident in the household (e.g., mother's brothers) will be called upon to help discipline little boys when the others fail to control their behavior.

From the time children are able to walk without assistance and to understand directions, they will be given chores, such as carrying small pails of water and other burdens, running errands in the neighborhood, or selling homemade candy in the streets.

#### **Adolescence**

In early adolescence, when they can be really useful in household and productive activities, girls and boys may be passed around within the larger kin group wherever help is needed. A child learns to feel comfortable sleeping and eating in several different households (Sanford, 1971).

#### **Adulthood**

Despite the relatively high status of women, many of them suffer physical abuse by the men with whom they consort, but since sexual dimorphism tends to be slight, the women are not adverse to striking back—but usually not enough to risk losing the man. Due to the migrant labor customs, men are in short supply between late teenage and retirement. Women often vie with one another for a man's favor, sometimes coming to blows, although shouting matches, including name-calling, insults and denunciations, are more common.

Most people have several different mates during their lifetimes, but as late middle age approaches, many of them settle down into a monogamous relationship, that may or may not include co-residence. It is not uncommon for such couples to go through a legal marriage ceremony, often just days or even hours before the death of one of them.

### **The Aged**

The elders are respected, but often neglected or ignored by their adult offspring or grandchildren. In return, or in order to secure a favor, an individual may threaten to haunt their children after death.

#### **Dying and Death**

With advancing age, references to "taking a trip"—a euphemism for death—will be heard. Roman Catholic beliefs concerning what happens later, are blended with those from other traditions, some very old and probably of Amerindian origins, and others clearly showing the influence of more recent associations with other Caribbean peoples of African descent (González, 1995).

Deaths of infants and of the elderly are considered "normal," but persons in the prime of life are not expected to die, and when they do some evil is suspected—either from living enemies, a variety of evil spirits, or from jealous or angry dead ancestors. Even when the death is recognized as the result of an incurable illness or an accident, it is thought that these misfortunes may have been brought about by one or another of the above agents.

Immediately after death the women begin to keen; in the villages the news may be further announced by drumming, and relatives and neighbors begin to arrive for help. If there is a resident Catholic priest, he may be called to administer the last rites, but this is not always done. The body is washed and dressed, placed in a wooden coffin, and set upon a table for viewing. An allnight wake is held, during which paid mourners join the closest family members, offering prayers at intervals (Cayetano, 1977). Coffee or tea and sweet bread is offered at midnight to visitors. Burial occurs early the next morning in the community cemetery. In Belize in the 19th century, missionaries reported that there were rituals on the beach that first night, suggesting that the deceased would be leaving by sea, but this is no longer done.

On the ninth night after death, which today is usually held on a Saturday night, another wake is held. This is considered to be so important that it is attended by nearly the whole community, as well as by friends and relatives from other villages, and even from overseas. It is believed that the soul wanders the earth, and may present a danger to the living, until this final ceremony. The atmosphere is not one of grief, but of celebration, including drinking and feasting, traditional drumming and dancing, gambling, and formal story telling (McCauley, 1981). The custom has been reported from societies throughout the Caribbean area, as well as in Ireland, and its origin among the Garifuna is not well understood. In this way, the community shows the deceased that she/he is remembered, but that it is now time to leave the living in peace (González, 1995; Howland, 1984).

### **CHANGING HEALTH PATTERNS**

The Garifuna have been in contact with Western civilization for some 300 years. Although some traditional beliefs and practices remain, most people today are aware of and respect biomedicine. Most communities have running water, electricity, government schools, television, telephones, fax machines, and computers. Thus, everyone knows something about bacterial and viral infections, diabetes, intestinal parasites, cancer, high blood pressure, and the like. They do not, however, always connect these or their own symptoms with poor hygiene or nutrition, or with potentially damaging behavior patterns involving substance abuse or irresponsible sexual activity.

Many young Garifuna believe themselves to be immune to AIDS, even when they prove to be positive for HIV. Ironically, despite this belief, there is considerable stigma attached to having the disease, so it is probably under-reported. Once diagnosed, many believe it to have been a punishment from God or from the ancestors. Castillo (2002) believes it to be the major cause of death among adult Garifuna in Livingston today. It is also ravaging the communities in Belize and Honduras. It is also no doubt responsible for a good bit of morbidity among adults, including probable psychological problems that go undiagnosed.

Genetically related diseases such as diabetes, arthritis, and sickle cell anemia are similarly less well understood, and are sometimes not recognized for what they are. Recent studies in both Honduras and in Guatemala indicate that drug use and alcoholism are increasing, as is obesity. All are undoubtedly related to aspects of the modern lifestyle, including relative sedentariness, transnationalism, migration, poverty, tourism, and a general decline in the quality of life.

Those Garifuna who do make these connections in general and in their own lives, live in the cities of both Central America and the United States, and at the most visit the villages only occasionally and for short periods. In their effort to learn more of their own roots and traditions, in what anthropologists call a "nativistic" or "revivalistic" movement (Sanford, 1974), they concentrate on the more romantic symbols of their past, and fail to recognize the sometimes-serious problems that beset the people left behind. Local leaders have become more sophisticated in political matters, and in Honduras and Belize there are efforts underway to improve economic opportunities so as to reduce emigration. However, the remaining Central American communities need all the help they can get if the people and culture are to survive.
