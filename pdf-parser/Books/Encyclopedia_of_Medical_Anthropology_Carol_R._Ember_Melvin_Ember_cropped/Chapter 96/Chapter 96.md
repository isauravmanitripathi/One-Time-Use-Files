# **Saraguros**

#### **Ruthbeth Finerman**

## **ALTERNATIVE NAMES**

The word "Saraguro" translates from the Quichua language as "Land of Corn." The indigenous community self-identifies as Saraguros, *indígenas*, or more rarely, as *runas* ("people"). Non-indigenous residents may speak of Saraguros with the pejorative *indio* or *chinita*. Saraguros occasionally make derogatory reference to acculturated individuals as *leichos* or *gente acomodado*.

## **LOCATION AND LINGUISTIC AFFILIATION**

Most Saraguros continue to reside in Loja Province, in Ecuador's southern Andes. A majority populates intermontane valleys surrounding the township of Saraguro (3.7S, 79.3W, elevation 640 m to 910 m). In addition to the town, the region comprises croplands, managed pastures, residences, and scattered *altiplano* woodlands and *paramo* grasslands. In recent generations, intense competition for land encouraged migration to exploit farm and pasture lands in the Yacuambi Valley on the eastern foothills of the Andes, and wage labor opportunities in major metropolitan centers. In the late 1990s, Ecuador's

economy collapsed, spurring hundreds of Saraguros to migrate to Spain for work as farmhands.

Virtually all elderly and most adult Saraguros speak both Spanish and Quichua, a southern Ecuadorian highland dialect of the Quechuan language (Harrison, 1989). Younger generations are less likely to speak Quichua, and few youths are proficient in their native tongue. Nevertheless, Saraguros retain a strong identity as *indígenas* and possess close cultural and political affiliations with all other Quichua speakers.

## **OVERVIEW OF THE CULTURE**

#### **Demographics and History**

Although census data are unreliable, Saraguros are estimated to number at least 20,000. Historically, the region remained independent until Incan domination in the late 15th century AD. At that time, Saraguro town was founded as a *tambo* or way station between Cuenca and Loja. While their origins remain uncertain, most Saraguros accept the view that their current population was founded through the intermarriage of forced migrants (*mitimaes*) and local Cañari or Palta (Macas, 1995).

European rule began by the 1530s, but lands remained in the possession of indigenous Saraguros. With construction of the PanAmerican Highway in the 1940s, non-Indians took control over most of the town center, but Saraguros maintain land claims in town and most of the surrounding countryside. Although contact with a dominant outside culture has influenced aspects of their culture, the indigenous community sustains a fairly strong sense of tradition and identity, and a basic distrust of external forces.

#### **Production**

Like most Andean peasants, Saraguros are agropastoralists (Gade, 1999; Wilson, 1999). Bullock-pulled plows are used to plant maize, potatoes, beans, wheat, and barley. Cattle herding yields major capital, and families also raise sheep, guinea pigs, swine, chickens, and rabbits. Wool from sheep is handspun and woven to fashion traditional Colonial-period garments. Crafts, including beadwork, embroidery, and weavings are also manufactured for personal use and for sale.

#### **Kinship, Marriage, and Family**

Descent here is reckoned bilaterally and egocentrically, although patronyms take precedence in official records. While monogamous, divorce and abandonment can occur. Most voice a preference for neolocality, yet small extended households predominate. There is no clan or lineage affiliation, but they express solidarity within *barrios*, politically linked neighborhoods that support communal lands and labor cooperatives. There is also a clear inclination toward *barrio* endogamy. Still, Saraguros possess a strong sense of household autonomy, making *barrio* alliances relatively unstable.

#### **Social Organization**

Strong differences in wealth and status exist among Saraguros, and between indigenous and non-indigenous residents (Belote, 1978). Status also differs somewhat by gender, as males enjoy a higher public profile. However, Saraguro women can garner recognition by sponsoring religious festivals and, as in other parts of Ecuador, they wield ample power over household resources, decisionmaking, and family comportment, particularly as they relate to health (Finerman, 1995; Wayland, 2001; Weismantel, 1988).

#### **Religion**

While evangelical movements have made some inroads in the region, Catholic doctrine dominates religious life. Yet, as in much of the Andes (Allen, 1997; Dover, Seibold, & McDowell, 1992; MacCormack, 1991), Saraguro beliefs and practices retain many elements of pre-Conquest cosmology, including animistic reverence for the sun, moon, wind, rivers, and rainbows. Such spirits are also linked to personalistic illnesses.

## **THE CONTEXT OF HEALTH: ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL FACTORS**

#### **Health Profile**

Reliable data are unavailable, but Ecuadorian health officials agree that Saraguro morbidity and mortality well exceed national rates. As in many Andean nations, rates of infant mortality for the richest and poorest provinces vary by as much as 200%. One survey found that more than 40% of Saraguros reported at least one health complaint during the prior two months (Kroeger & Barbira-Freedmann, 1992, pp. 251–252).

Newborns in Saraguro are slightly more vulnerable than average to post-partum infection. Infants and children experience frequent if not chronic parasitic infection, diarrhea and dehydration, and acute respiratory infection, although infectious disease rates began to fall after 1960 and most dramatically after about 1980, as a result of intensified immunization campaigns (UNICEF, 1995). Adults are subject to work-related injury, and health workers report that a sizeable proportion (up to 30% in some *barrios*) carry tuberculosis. Many adults also suffer complications from alcohol abuse. Malnutrition is less common, as most Saraguros sustain a balanced diet and active lifestyle. Yet, the PanAmerican Highway has eased access to high calorie but nutritionally inferior processed foods (e.g., sugar, white rice, noodles), alcohol, and tobacco, posing greater risk of obesity, hypertension and diabetes, particularly in pregnancy. The incidence of other so-called "diseases of development" such as cancer, heart disease, and sexually transmitted diseases has also grown.

#### **The Context of Health 939**

The indigenous population is also vulnerable to a range of traditional or culture-specific illnesses (Argüello & Sanhuenza, 1996; McKee & Argüello, 1988), such as nerves (*nervios*), envy (*envidia*), fright (*susto*), evil airs (*mal aire*), evil eye (*mal ojo*), soul loss (*espanto*), and witchcraft (*brujeria*). With the exception of *nervios*, children and elders are the most common victims of such disorders.

#### **Environmental Factors**

The natural ecosystem presents a mixed bag of health risks and benefits. The high altitude and cold temperatures produce several deaths each year from hypothermia. The climatic phenomenon *El Niño* produces devastating rains that wipe out crops and wash out roads, cutting off access to medical care. Wildlife—mainly venomous snakes and spiders—poses some threat, particularly since most children and older adults walk barefoot. Domesticated animals expose their owners to zoonoses including tuberculosis, rabies, flea and tick infestations, and a host of parasitic diseases. Nevertheless, the rich ecosystem also supports a diverse food supply and a vast array of medicinal plant species that are routinely exploited for health promotion in Saraguro and throughout the Andes (Bastien, 1987; Naranjo & Escaleras, 1995; Wilson, 1999).

Household ecology also yields risks, although these have shifted over time. Most old homes have dirt floors, and kin tend to share beds in one room, facilitating contact with contaminants and the spread of communicable disease. Recent home renovations and new homes invariably boast plank flooring and separate sleeping quarters, yet these upgrades mainly reflect the crowding of large extended families into a single home. Prior to 1990, most Saraguros cooked on open hearths fueled by firewood, risking burns and respiratory irritation. However, depletion of firewood supplies has since forced a shift to use of cooking gas. This has reduced hearth fire hazards, but poses a danger should gas cylinders rupture and explode. During the same period, most homes gained access to water pipelines, but the unpurified water continues to spread disease. The community also lacks effective sewage and waste disposal, but many homes now feature outdoor latrines and showers, slightly reducing waste levels indoors. Still, some Saraguros continue to collect urine in the home (for use in dye vats), and most residents come into contact with solid waste and contaminated soil and water when cultivating fields.

#### **Social Factors**

Saraguros associate social and economic productivity with health, thus disability, inactivity, or unemployment is considered both unhealthy and antisocial. Pressure to remain productive has fostered migration, particularly of unemployed males, forcing many women and young children to take charge over households, crops, and herds. Worse still, the migrants frequently return from the lowlands and cities carrying a host of new diseases (e.g., malaria, cholera) that spread through the community.

Interpersonal harmony is also viewed as fundamental to health, and some illnesses are attributed to anger, envy, despair, or discord. Thus, social cohesion is characterized as essential to well-being, and gossip stands as a powerful social control mechanism. Women here are concerned to avoid gossip should their children appear ill or malnourished and they take special pride when told that their children look robust. These women retain the primary social role in managing family health, and skillful healers gain substantial power in both the household and community (Finerman, 1995). Females are socialized into the family healer role during childhood, when they begin to assist their own mothers in preparing remedies for younger siblings. As they age and establish their own families, women continue to consult their mothers and female friends for health care advice.

### **Political and Economic Factors**

Throughout most of their history, Saraguros remained at the social, political, and economic periphery of the state. However, the PanAmerican Highway expanded contact, and the adoption of cattle husbandry increased dependence on the national economy. In the final decades of the 20th century, depleted oil reserves reduced the nation's wealth, sustained *El Niño* rains devastated roads and infrastructure, and pervasive political corruption and massive international debt all combined to lead Ecuador into financial ruin. Saraguros, previously immune from economic downturns, were gravely impacted as banks, schools, and hospitals closed, the national currency (the *Sucre*) was abandoned, prices for pharmaceuticals and essential goods soared, and commercial ventures failed. As the crisis intensified, health levels began to deteriorate. While reliable statistics are not available, government officials claim that mortality among infants, children, and elders has begun to rise, and domestic abuse reports have increased.

## **MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS**

Indigenous Saraguro curing specialists include herbalists, midwives, and shamans. Herbalists provide medicinal plant preparations and advice on diet for a range of ailments. Midwives advise women on fertility, prenatal and postpartum care, and may assist in labor and delivery, employing massage, baths, herbal remedies, and dietary guidance. *Curanderos* specialize in intractable conditions, particularly illnesses suspected of being caused by supernatural agents. Nevertheless, Saraguros make minimal use of these practitioners, treating almost all illnesses with home remedies (*remedios casseros*). Not surprisingly, only a few of these specialists practice here, and those who do are more likely to be patronized by nonindigenous town residents.

In addition to traditional curers, the town supports a few private physicians and dentists, and a hospital staffed by medical and nursing interns and community health workers. Several private pharmacies also operate, typically selling products without prescription. But, as with traditional healers, Saraguros have proven unlikely to consult biomedical providers unless all home treatment efforts are exhausted.

Home-based health care combines preventive activities involving hygiene, dress, dietary laws, and personal comportment, plus an extensive repertoire of herbal remedies. Women view their healing role as a natural extension of their duties in bathing, clothing, feeding, and generally nurturing kin. They invariably argue that they are the first to spot the signs of illness (e.g., appetite or sleep loss, pain, lethargy) and they usually possess years of healing experience. Most also reason that other practitioners could never match a mother's concern for her own family's welfare.

## **CLASSIFICATION OF ILLNESS, THEORIES OF ILLNESS, AND TREATMENT OF ILLNESS**

### **Etiology**

Saraguro views of illness concern the actions of both naturalistic and personalistic agents. One of the most pervasive beliefs here and throughout Latin America is that of humoral opposition (Foster, 1998). Specifically, "heat" and "cold" appear as ubiquitous elements, found in individuals, animals, plants, foods, seasons, and emotional states. A balanced state assures health, while an excess or deficiency yields illness and symptoms of heat (e.g., fevers, blisters, infection) or signs of cold (e.g., chills, cough, diarrhea).

Naturalistic etiologies here also reflect a view of the outside world as inherently dangerous (Finerman, 1987). Illness is considered most likely to occur when eating or socializing away from home, and especially when travelling a great distance (although this belief holds more strongly for women than for men). The introduction of germ theory merely reinforced opinions of the outdoors as infested with toxins, contaminants, and microscopic *bichos* or "bugs." Saraguros invariably complain that cheese, milk, and similar foods prepared by other families are inferior or "dirty" (*sucio*); food prepared in the town is particularly tainted. Consequently, little of the food served at local communal festivals is consumed on the spot; most is taken home and re-cooked to eliminate impurities. When offered refreshment, guests routinely hear the phrase, *Quizás no le hace mal* ("Maybe this will do you no harm") and respond with *Dios se lo pague* ("God will repay you"), a refrain that both reassures and warns the host.

Intense natural emotions can also cause harm (Tousignant, 1988). For example, adult Saraguro women suffer a high prevalence of *nervios* ("nerves"), a physical collapse resembling depression, which they usually blame on *pura sufrimiento*: "pure misery." *Nervios* is also common for women overwhelmed by the strain of family illness. While disabling, the condition offers relief from the stress of family care and affords a degree of control over kin (Finerman, 1988). Such ailments also reveal how conditions of mind and body are linked in Saraguro culture. Mental illness is not generally recognized here; instead, both physiological and psychological distress find expression in physical form.

In addition to these naturalistic etiologies, Saraguros retain several pre-conquest animistic beliefs about dangerous supernatural forces including sacred lagoons, winds, rainbows, rivers, the earth, moon, and sun. While few expressly describe these agents in anthropomorphic terms, they manifest their concerns in folktales and codes of conduct. For instance, many recount legends or personal accounts where mountaintop lagoons rise from their banks, seeking to abduct women. They use medicinal plant bundles to "sweep away" malevolent winds, and avoid rivers where the rainbow is said to impregnate female bathers. During feasts, hosts may spill small offerings of alcohol as a gift to the earth mother (*pacha mama*), and many cease planting during a new moon to avoid crop failure. Saraguros also wear distinctive hats while outdoors, to show respect for the sun and thus avoid its "vengeance." Of note, younger generations increasingly ignore these traditions, especially the precaution of wearing hats. Few minors have even heard of once common illnesses like *bao de agua* ("water fright illness"). Such youths leave elders fretful about the health and well-being of their families and community.

Despite a decline in some animistic beliefs, nearly all Saraguros retain conviction in the power of other human beings to cause harm through envy, evil eye, or witchcraft. Mothers here usually swaddle infants and carry them on their backs hidden under shawls, to protect them from envious gazes. Young children wear red bandanas, jewelry, or clothing to ward off witches. Even small animals (especially kittens) may be safeguarded with a red collar. Nonhumans (e.g., snakes, dogs) are also said to cause magical fright or soul loss sickness, although episodes here are relatively rare.

#### **Treatment**

As noted, Saraguros usually rely on their mothers or wives to manage health, despite access to various professional curers. This "popular" or informal sector of family-based care predominates cross-culturally (Kleinman, 1980); in southern Ecuador Saraguros enjoy a degree of fame for their expertise in herbal medicine.

Indigenous women here possess curing knowledge that is at once highly complex and syncretic, blending traditional curing elements with biomedicine. The richness of their knowledge derives from a lifetime of experience in treating sick kin and from continual expansion of their curing arsenal. Saraguro women routinely consult their own mothers and female friends for advice, and they gain fresh curing insights from health specialists. Women usually accompany spouses and children to practitioners, and providers tend to direct treatment instructions to these women. In the process, they learn new concepts and therapies that help them upgrade their curing routines. By contrast, specialists such as *curanderos*, midwives, and physicians almost never share insights among one

another; indeed, they usually express scorn for different medical systems.

Family care in this population incorporates both preventive and primary care. Illness prevention is accomplished mainly through attention to dress, hygiene, and diet. Infants and children are clothed in layers to bundle them against malevolent winds and humoral disorders. As noted, children may also be dressed in red to guard against witchcraft. Hygiene acts to cleanse away contaminants, eliminate humoral excess, and thwart sorcery. Thus, medicinal plants may be added to bath water to both clean skin and prevent evil airs, while hairs lost during combing are meticulously gathered into bundles and burned to keep them out of the hands of witches. Meals include a mix of nutrients and medicinal plants, designed to ensure nutritional and humoral equilibrium. Some foods are also utilized as remedies. For example, humorally "hot" foods such as chilis, raw sugar ( *panela*), and beef can alleviate ailments like extreme cold (*recaida*), while "cold" foods such as milk, white sugar, and chicken help to reverse ailments such as extreme heat (*gangrena*). Several foods are also expressly prescribed or prohibited during various stages of the reproductive cycle. For instance, avocado consumption is taboo for menstruating girls, as it is considered toxic at such times.

A majority of treatments are administered as herbal teas (*aguita* or *infusión*), however many remedies also take the form of a vapor bath (*baño vapor*), spray (*sopla*), flotation (*flotación*), rub (*sobado*), poultice (*cataplasma*), or plaster (*escayola*). Saraguro women take pride in their mastery of medicinal plant lore. They can name dozens or even hundreds of plants in free lists, and describe plant growth habits, uses for different plant parts, processing techniques, and applications. Women cultivate many of the more vital domesticated medicinal plants in kitchen gardens (*huertas*), located next to or near the house. These gardens vary in size and complexity, depending on several factors. Often, the largest and most complex gardens are cultivated by women with many children, many years of curing experience, and the wealth and labor pool necessary to support garden maintenance. Such gardens can contain hundreds of varieties of medicinal plants. Even young brides and elderly women tend medicinal plant gardens, although these are likely to be smaller and less diverse. Women add to their reserves by gathering hundreds of medicinal plants that grow wild in the region's diverse ecosystems (Naranjo & Escaleras, 1995).

## **SEXUALITY AND REPRODUCTION**

#### **Sexual Activity**

Despite strong affiliation with Catholicism, Saraguros demonstrate only weak adherence to religious mores regarding sex. In particular, premarital sex is only mildly discouraged, and births outside wedlock are both common and readily accepted. Indeed, such births are a positive indicator of a female's fecundity and can enhance her prospects for marriage, though aspirations decrease with subsequent pregnancies. Extramarital affairs incur slightly more social disapproval, yet most residents profess tolerance, particularly in cases of absent spouses (e.g., wives of migrant workers, or abandoned spouses). Homosexuality is criticized, but almost never discussed. Greater censure is reserved for incest, which is called immoral and unhealthy. Local folklore claims that incestuous couples gradually transform into dogs, manifesting new canine attributes after each transgression. For the most part, however, locals regard sex as both normal and healthy, but also a private matter. Women follow select rules of sexual decorum; in particular, they cover their mouths when smiling and laughing, as showing teeth is vulgar. However, men and women are equally fond of sexual jokes and innuendo.

#### **Fertility**

In the indigenous community, the social transition from childhood to adulthood is not marked by initiation into sexual activity or, in the case of females, by menarche. Instead, childbirth is the main marker of maturity. Females retain the title "girl" (*niña*) or "child" (*hija*) even after marriage, until their first birth. Males also lose the moniker *niño* or *hijo* only after they have children. Childbearing is significant in most peasant societies; offspring are critical to expand a family's labor pool and provide care for aging parents; households also procure support through fictive kin networks (Mitchell, 1991, pp. 47–51).

Fertility itself is a sign of good health and humoral equilibrium. A woman who readily conceives and bears children is robust and "warm"; infertility and miscarriage may arise from various problems, including a "cold" metabolism, witchcraft, and envy. Barren women are also considered prone to weakness (*debilidad*) and heart failure.

Saraguro understandings of conception shifted in recent generations. Accounts from the 1960s cite preformationist views. At that time, locals claimed that males were preformed in sperm and implanted in the womb, while females generated inside the mother. By the 1970s they had abandoned such notions, as more youths learned biology in school. After that point, conception was explained as the fusion of egg and sperm, while the womb was characterized as a "basket" that carries the fetus.

### **Fertility Control**

Ideal family size also evolved over the last half of the 20th century. Historically, Saraguro couples hoped to have many children to expand production and care for their aging parents. Yet, by the 1950s competition for land intensified and youths deserted Saraguro in search of acreage and wages. More couples also found that larger families could not afford to educate all of their children. By the 1970s, family planning campaigns began to actively promote the benefits of smaller families. Today, families with just one son and one daughter are the ideal. Even so, Saraguros face multiple barriers to effective contraception.

Church representatives in Saraguro condemn birth control, and many men fear that contraception facilitates adultery by women. Such antagonisms make discussion of the topic both sensitive and infrequent. Yet, most in the indigenous community regard pregnancy prevention as a woman's privilege, and as her burden. A majority of women rely on herbal teas to prevent or terminate a pregnancy, though such preparations are unreliable. Occasionally, women seeking abortion consult *curanderos*, or travel to larger cities to purchase contraception. Few see local physicians or druggists, fearing gossip. A small number have taken drastic steps to induce miscarriage, pounding their belly, falling down hillsides, or ingesting irritants such as wood ashes. Still, few attempt to terminate unwanted pregnancies; almost all reconcile themselves to the condition as "God's will" (*lo que Dios quiere*). Nevertheless, they frequently bemoan their large families and extol the good fortune of women with few children.

## **HEALTH THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE**

#### **Pregnancy and Birth**

As noted, pregnancy usually occasions happiness or, at worst, forbearance. In any event, Saraguros describe the

#### **Health through the Life Cycle 943**

condition as fraught with danger. Thus, they strive to diagnose pregnancy early, to ensure a successful outcome (Finerman, 1988). Pregnancy signs cited most frequently include interrupted menses and/or morning sickness. Some report other indicators such as a darkening of the nipples and changes in appetite, sleep, or energy levels. A few claim to detect pregnancy through the presence of white solids in expectorate or urine.

Once recognized, Saraguros take protective measures. Usually, the expectant mother is encouraged to fulfill food cravings; these are credited to the fetus, which may kick or harm its mother if frustrated. Exceptions to such indulgence are extremely "hot" or "cold" foods, which might exert additive or antagonistic effects on the hot state of pregnancy and induce illness. Women may also reduce workloads and avoid activities that shake the body (e.g., work at sewing machines or weaving looms, as well as sexual activity), as these could prematurely "wake the child." Emotional disturbances, including domestic arguments, accidents, shock, and envy are also harmful. Pregnant women are also warned to avoid cemeteries (e.g., funerals, All Soul's Day mass) as they readily succumb to sickness from evil airs (*aire grande*) around graves.

Across Latin America there is great variation in the use of birth attendants (Bolton & Bolton, 1978; Cosminsky, 1976). In Saraguro, indigenous women almost always give birth at home, alone or assisted by their spouses. Primiparous (first time) mothers are somewhat more inclined to seek additional assistance from female relatives or midwives. Hospital deliveries are rare; most result from protracted labor or other complications.

During accouchement, Saraguro women may soak in an herbal bath or drink medicinal plant teas to aid labor; eating is permissible, but few do so. Women rest in any position that feels comfortable, but avoid sudden movement. Husbands provide massage to reduce pain. Women usually deliver in a vertical squat position supported by spouses or female attendants, if present. The umbilical cord is cut immediately upon delivery; some claim that this practice prevents the womb from "reclaiming" the infant. Women may then smoke tobacco or datura, to encourage placental rejection. Customarily, the placenta is buried at the entrance to a home, without prayer or special ceremony.

Childbirth is followed by a 40-day post-partum confinement (*la quarenta*). This term of lying-in protects the debilitated mother and newborn from evil airs and other illnesses. During this stage, both take a series of herbal baths on prescribed days. Mothers wrap their abdomen with poultices made from various fats and medicinal plants, to aid recovery, and nourish the womb. New mothers also adhere to a strict traditional diet. They continue to avoid foods with extreme humoral qualities, especially cold foods, claiming these sicken a mother as her metabolism cools after the heat of pregnancy. They also eschew foods like citrus that might "cut off" lactation.

#### **Infancy**

Indigenous parents profess no gender preference among offspring. Both sexes retain their parents' names, and both can inherit. Twin births seem to cause no concern, but are extremely rare in this population. It is possible that, in the past, such births precipitated higher maternal mortality, leaving a population that is genetically less prone to multiple pregnancy. Birth defects and deformities do incite shame and are interpreted as a punishment from God. However, the child faces minimal risk for active or passive infanticide, since religious doctrine effectively prohibits such recourse. Still, a few families have hidden such offspring at home, so that their disgrace is less public.

Saraguros rightly regard newborns as especially vulnerable to illness and death; fears are understandable given that, prior to the 1960s, infant mortality at times reached 40%. Waves of measles, chicken pox, and whooping cough decimated families before immunization campaigns intensified. Infants still face substantial risk of diarrhea and dehydration, respiratory infection, and communicable disease, and are considered highly prone to evil airs, magical fright, soul loss, envy sickness, and witchcraft.

Here and elsewhere in Latin America, infants and children who die before their First Communion are said to become angels or *angelitos* (Lillo, 1942). The dead child is adorned with a paper crown and wings, and seated on a decorated altar in their home. Their death is marked by an extended period of feasting and dancing; the tradition helps parents to better cope with the loss of a child.

While such deaths are celebrated, Saraguros take pains to forestall the loss of offspring. Newborns are kept in virtual isolation for the first 40 days of life. Saraguro mothers breast-feed infants on demand, rather than on a schedule. Mothers customarily breast-feed for one year, or until the mother becomes pregnant again. Solids (mostly cereals) are introduced gradually, usually beginning around 6 months of age. Infants wear little clothing while indoors and can defecate freely, but they are kept clean, warm, and protected. As they grow they are free to explore the home, under the watchful eyes of their mother or older siblings. Infants enjoy attention from multiple caretakers, including parents, siblings, and extended kin. By the age of five, most children here begin to help carry and tend younger siblings.

Baptism represents a crucial religious rite and supernatural safeguard against illness, but the ritual cannot take place until some months after birth. In Ecuador, infants must complete a preliminary course of immunizations before they can be baptized. Local community health workers usually assist by making house calls to finish the vaccination series. Infants must also be strong enough to leave the safety of home. Therefore, most parents arrange baptism after the infant is at least 6 months old and celebrate the occasion with only a private family feast.

When taken outdoors, an infant is dressed in layers of clothing and red cord, swaddled, and carried on the caretaker's back under one or (more often) two shawls. Some mothers explain that swaddling helps the infant grow straight, while others claim the child is more comfortable and sleeps more readily when bound. However, the practice also curbs movement under shawls that might attract unwelcome attention, thereby protecting infants from witchcraft and envy.

### **Childhood**

The transition from infancy to childhood in Saraguro is gradual, marked mainly by enhanced mobility, communication, and autonomy. Once offspring begin to walk, talk, and play independently, they are given more responsibilities and tasks. By five years of age children begin to help with younger siblings, keep watch over sheep and cattle, and fetch items for their mothers. Daughters assist mothers in meal preparation, sibling care, housework, and preparation of medicinal remedies. Parents rarely discipline offspring, although they may threaten spankings or a thrashing with nettles. More often, parents simply assign more chores, reasoning that work keeps children too busy to cause trouble.

In Saraguro, children must be fully vaccinated to register for school. Nonetheless, sickness rates increase for students, as contagious and parasitic diseases spread and children suffer more accidental injury. Parents also fear that offspring will fall ill from foods prepared at school or purchased in town. Over time, though, children come to be viewed as relatively safe from illness, including personalistic conditions like evil airs, envy, and magical fright. Risk seems to decline around the time children complete the Catholic rites of Confirmation and First Communion.

#### **Adolescence**

Puberty and adolescence receive almost no recognition in this population. Typically, daughters quietly inform their mothers of the onset of menarche, but they receive little instruction and face few restrictions other than minor dietary taboos (e.g., consumption of avocado) and perhaps admonishment to avoid pregnancy. Adolescent sons garner still less attention, but may gain greater freedom; young Saraguro males frequently stay out all night attending fiestas or drinking with male companions. Such behavior risks few penalties other than mild parental rebuke. Youths are said to face few health risks, other than unplanned pregnancy or injury precipitated by intoxication.

### **Adulthood**

Most Saraguro adults describe their lifestyle as exceptionally healthy (*sano*), comprising vigorous labor, and a balanced diet. Nevertheless, a majority report chronic, albeit minor complaints like muscle aches, fatigue, and eye strain, plus a range of acute respiratory and intestinal disorders. Other common concerns include pregnancy, physical trauma (usually related to work or alcohol intoxication), alcoholism, animal bites, and tuberculosis. Adults claim to suffer fewer traditional ailments like magical fright and soul loss, yet *nervios* is pervasive among adults (especially women), and *mal aire* strikes most adults who take cattle to pastures in the windy and wet high elevation *paramos*.

### **The Aged**

Aging, like other social transitions, is a subtle process in this population. This is largely because there is no designated age for "retirement" or "social security" benefits; Most Saraguros remain economically productive throughout their lives, and provide supplemental aid with family care and curing expertise. Also, Saraguros show few signs of aging; hair tends to remain black until

extreme old age, and years of sun and wind exposure reduce skin elasticity early in life, making aging or decline difficult to detect. Often, the sole mark of maturity is a subtle change in mode of address. Over the years, Saraguro men gain the title *Taita* or *Taiti*, and women come to be called *Mama*. These Quichua terms, meaning father and mother, are titles of respect used by all Saraguros, not merely kin. It is unclear precisely when and why the title is added to one's Christian name, but it correlates with advanced age and a high level of social recognition.

While elders are treated with deference, aging here is accompanied by a decline in overall health. Muscle pain and respiratory and digestive disorders common among adults advance into persistent or even debilitating conditions. The aged also manifest high rates of arthritis, visual impairment, wasting, more cases of active tuberculosis, and traditional syndromes, especially *mal aire*, and *nervios*. Extended kin are expected to offer care, but elders sometimes complain that relatives are of little help; a few have no surviving kin to look after them. After Ecuador's financial crash in the 1990s, many elders were abandoned, as kin left the community in search of work. In such instances, elders have turned to fictive kin, friends, and neighbors for health care and other assistance.

#### **Death**

Saraguros exhibit both respect for and fear of the dead. With the exception of children honored as *angelitos*, the deceased seem to be regarded in vaguely malevolent terms. Survivors are loath to speak of the dead by their Christian name; more often, the deceased is referred to obliquely as *el cadver* or *el difunto*. Mourners view corpses as corrupted flesh that pollutes the home and threatens "corpse sickness" (*aire grande*), which can rob the living of their souls and even their lives. Consequently, indigenous funerary customs venerate the memory of the dead, but also operate to protect the health and well-being of the family and community.

Soon after death, the body is bathed, dressed for burial, and laid out at home. A rosary is placed in the hands, and candles encircle the bier. Mourners "accompany" the corpse on an all-night vigil and pray for their soul. As the night progresses, attendants may consume alcohol to toast the dead and pass the hours. The coffin is then carried to church for funeral mass, and then up a hill to the local cemetery. At graveside, mourners remove their hats (but hold these over their heads out of respect for the sun) and recite final prayers. Saraguros assert that open graves emit dangerous airs and the essence of ghosts. Thus, mourners (especially those who handled the corpse, held vigil, or prepared the grave) return home immediately after the ceremony and bathe to remove any residue of death. Most also pour cologne in their hands and cup it to their face, rubbing it in and inhaling deeply as a treatment for supernatural illness.

Soon after mass and burial, family and friends strip the home of all possessions; these are carried to a local river, where all goods (e.g., clothing, bedding, and even furniture) are meticulously washed to purge the residue of death. The walls and floor of the house are also scrubbed, and doors and windows are left open for several hours to expel any lingering malevolent airs or spirits.

Rites may be interrupted if cause of death is in doubt (Finerman, 1984). Until recently, physicians performed autopsies in the cemetery just prior to burial, in full view of the mourners. Since proper instruments and lab analysis were not available onsite, results were unreliable at best. Worse still, this act delayed burial for hours and subjected mourners to the sight of a loved one's dissection (for which kin were billed). Today, bodies are usually autopsied at the hospital, then released for vigil, mass, and interment.

## **CHANGING HEALTH PATTERNS**

In many respects, it is a mistake to characterize any health system as "traditional," because medical systems undergo constant transformation (Finerman, 1989). For Saraguros, contemporary beliefs and practices form a syncretic fusion of pre-conquest doctrines (e.g., animistic views of the sun, rainbows, rivers, and winds), Colonial theories (e.g., humoral equilibrium), and contemporary biomedicine (e.g., pharmaceuticals). Indigenous women here do not distinguish between these; all are selectively added or rejected on the basis of perceived efficacy. No matter the source (i.e., kin, friends, health specialists, or public education campaigns), new concepts that better explain illness causation, and innovative procedures that more effectively diagnose or cure, are readily incorporated into family care. Thus, explanatory models like humoral opposition or germ theory, and diagnostic labels like "parasites" are welcomed, as these explain how sickness can arise from agents too small to see. Similarly, new medications like anti-parasitic purgatives can yield dramatic results. Nevertheless, innovations are rejected if they contradict accepted tenets or render poor results. Consequently, doctors have failed to dissuade mothers from treating kin and to rely instead on hospitals, since such facilities rate as inferior to the experience and compassion mothers can offer.

Saraguro is experiencing other transitions that shape health, for better or worse. As noted, the collapse of Ecuador's roads, infrastructure and economy have devastated its citizens. At present, most Saraguros find themselves in debt, lowering quality of life, and risking increased malnutrition, morbidity, and mortality. Hundreds have migrated, robbing the community of many of its youngest and most productive members, and leaving many children and elders abandoned.

Despite such setbacks, agencies have stepped up support for aid and development. Programs include livestock vaccination, nutrition supplements, child immunization, and community health (Barreto, Barrera, Unda, & Carri, 1996). Alcoholics Anonymous has established chapters in a few *barrios*, helping Saraguros recover their productivity. Day care centers have opened, freeing women to expand economic activity (though centers struggle with funding cuts). Some *barrios* participate in new cooperative economic ventures (e.g., weaving mills, trout farms, greenhouses for cash crops, and incipient ecotourism) selling wares in and beyond the community. Such programs help offset some current threats to health. More critically, they represent an investment in the future, offering the best prospect for the continued wellbeing of Saraguros and their culture.
