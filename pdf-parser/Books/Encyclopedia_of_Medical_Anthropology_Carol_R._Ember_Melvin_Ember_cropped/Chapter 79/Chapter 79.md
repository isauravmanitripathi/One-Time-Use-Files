## **ALTERNATIVE NAMES**

China referred to the Japanese in ancient writings as "Children of *Wa*," using the characters of the sun and the tree in script. This name acknowledged the indigenous mythology of the Japanese as ancestors of the sun goddess, and the cultural focus of harmony. From around AD 500, the Japanese referred to themselves as *Yamato*, which was also the name of their central island, created in myth by the eighth son of the sun goddess; they currently pronounce these characters as *Nippon* or *Nihon* (de Bary & Dykstra, 2001).

## **LOCATION AND LINGUISTIC AFFILIATION**

Japan consists of several thousand islands, however most of the population inhabits four major islands, located between the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Japan, near Korea to the northeast, China to the east, and Russia to the north. Despite the massive urbanization over the last 50 years, the mountainous topography of the islands has helped the people retain regional characteristics, including dialects in at least 21 regions and regional family names. Japanese administration is by prefecture (*ken* or *to*). Within the 47 prefectures, there are cities (*gun* or *shi*), each of which are subdivided into wards (*ku*), and blocks, or neighborhoods (*chome*).

The linguistic origin of the Japanese language is debated, however the leading theories are either that it is from the Ural-Altaic family (Miller, 1972) or that it is related to Korean (Ohno, 1970). The Japanese written language includes a complex collection of characters derived from Chinese, and two native Japanese syllabary, or *kana*, each of which include 39 syllables. The Japanese use *Hiragana* for Japanese words, and certain grammatical elements. The *Katakana* includes the same sounds of the *hiragana* syllabary, but is used to write foreign loan words and words written for emphasis, such as in advertising. Japanese language is flexible, accepting loan words for new and evolving social ideas. Recent trends in Japan include not only the adoption of loan words, but also the adoption of Roman characters in advertising. Despite the liberal sprinkling of Western concepts and Western text, their meanings and pronunciation retain a distinct Japanese flavor.

## **OVERVIEW OF THE CULTURE**

#### **Demographics**

There were 127 million Japanese in Japan in 2000 (World Health Organization, 2002a), making it the eighth largest population in the world (see Table 1). The annual growth rate in 2000 was 0.3%, much lower than the 1.1% in the United States. Twenty-three percent of the Japanese population is over 65, higher than the 16.6% in the United States. The fertility rate is below replacement level in Japan, at 1.4 children per woman, while, in the United States, the fertility rate is 2.0. Seventy-five percent of the Japanese live in urban areas. In the 1930s, the Japanese household was primarily multigenerational, with around 70% of the elderly living with their children. In 1955, about half of Japanese households were still three generations, and by 1990, 60% were nuclear family households and only 15% were three generations (Feeney & Mason, 2001). The Japanese citizenry are educated and literate, with 100% of the population completing primary school since 1955, and 95% completing secondary school during the same period. In 1996, estimates were that 31% of the population was enrolled in tertiary education. However, a gender gap persists in higher education, with 27.2 per 1,000 women in third level education, compared with 35.8 per 1,000 men

### **History**

The Japanese migrated to the islands in AD 470, where they were primarily a tribal people, with heterogeneous, regional, cultural, and social patterns. The Empress Suiko reigned from 592–628, and institutionalized several elements of Chinese civilization into Japanese social and political life, including the adoption of the Chinese writing system, rules of rank and etiquette, the Chinese calendar, diplomatic relations with China, a highway system, and a constitution. The Nara period (709–784) institutionalized Buddhist religion and with it, Chinese images, books, ritual devises, astronomy, and architecture. This period also gave rise to the public bath, cremation, maps, and an irrigation system. The Heian period (8th to 12th century) was a period of cultural evolution, including the development of an indigenous Japanese *kana* writing system, poetry, and scroll paintings. Feudal institutions, a militaristic government, and political power struggles resulted in the social disorder and feudal warfare that characterized the Medieval period (12th to 16th century). However, this period also saw the rise of Zen Buddhism, and the development of an indigenous healing system based on Chinese medicine. The Tokugawa period (1603–1868) marked military reunification, and the development of the *bushido*, or the way of the Samurai warrior. Confucian rules of civil order, including rules of

#### **Overview of the Culture 767**

loyalty, social hierarchy, and filial piety, were institutionalized into the society, as well as an aversion to outside cultural influences.

The 700 years of cultural isolation during the Medieval and Tokugawa periods (1185–1853) allowed not only a richly developed cultural identity, but also an intense nationalism. The 1847 Meiji restoration was the official end of this international isolation, as the government centralized, deposing the feudal landholders, as well as modernizing education, the judiciary, the military, and their economic system (de Bary & Dykstra, 2001; Reischauer, 1981; Vogel, 1967; Yoshino, 1992). Japan's late but rapid rise in industry and urbanization has set it apart from other East Asian countries, and its capitalistic economy was based on a Confucian social and political order, creating an industrial organization very different from most other industrialized countries.

#### **Economy and Occupations**

Japan had an agricultural economy until the turn of the 20th century, and the percentage of the total labor force in agriculture shifted from 33% in 1960 to 7% in 1990. As of 1990, the percentage of employment for all men and all women over age 15 was 77% and 50%, respectively. A statistical "M" shaped curve characterizes Japanese women's employment since 1965, with the highest rates of employment from 20–24 and 40–49, and lower rates during childrearing ages (Okunishi, 2001). In 1998, 36% of women were employed part-time, compared with 12% of employed men in the same year (United Nations, 2000). Most women (54%) work in clerical, sales, and service fields, and the wage differential for women was 60% of male wages in 1990 (Bauer, 2001).

#### **Family and Kinship**

Japan had a patrilineal kinship system organized around the household, or *ie*. Within this system, the eldest son succeeded the father, and inherited the family property and the responsibilities of the househead. Other sons established stem families (Befu, 1980, 1993; DeNoon, Hudson, McCormack & Morris-Suzuki, 2001). The household was a cooperative unit, and included the parents, eldest son and his wife, and their children, and sometimes workers for the family, as well as adopted sons-in-laws (when there was no oldest son). The *ie* is also a concept, and it refers to the entire lineage of ancestors. Stem families then were essentially equivalent to nuclear families, as they were established outside the *ie* or household structure. These stem families had a much less important role in the economics of the family. Therefore, this kinship pattern allowed for the mobility of nuclear families, which were free to move to the cities with the coming of urbanization and industrialization, perhaps facilitating the rapid trend toward urbanization of Japan after World War II (Vogel, 1967).

## **Religious Traditions and Philosophical Underpinnings**

Shrines, temples, and doorways draped with folded paper punctuate the seemingly endless urban landscape of Japan. These sights belie the sustained importance of Japanese traditional, philosophical, and religious underpinnings. Japan's first religion, Shinto, continues to influence day to day cultural patterns. Based in earlier animistic and shamanistic spiritual traditions, Shinto shrines honor the gods and goddesses of ancient Japanese mythology. Shinto concepts that are important to Japanese daily life include cleanliness of the body and the dwelling structure, symbolic cleansing required before entering Shinto structures, at important seasonal events, and funerals. Ritual devices include salt for purification, rice and *sake* for offerings, and folded paper, bells and rope as communication with the deities.

Buddhism arrived from China in the 5th century. While Shinto was the people's religion, the elite adopted Buddhism. Japanese Buddhism had numerous sects, which rose and fell with the important families that adopted them. Zen Buddhism is especially important in Japanese culture, with an emphasis on personal effort, personal sacrifice, dedication, exertion, and attunement to the body, as well as meditative activities involving daily activities such as tea, flower arrangement, or gardening.

Neo-Confucian philosophical traditions are embedded in religious and secular institutions today, including loyalty and piety in the five essential human relationships, which are father–son, ruler–son, husband–wife, older brother– younger brother, and between friends (de Bary & Dykstra, 2001).

#### **Sociocultural Norms**

Research shows that two opposing dynamics are central in Japanese social interactions. One dynamic is the perception of relative intimacy between oneself and another. Shared group membership and a commitment to group harmony and solidarity foster intimacy among group members. The opposing dynamic is the hierarchial organization within any given group. This hierarchy arises from differences in age, social status, and social roles. Appropriate behavioral styles and norms about social exchange in a given situation depend on the accurate perception of relative social distance between any given two participants (*kejime*). Interaction between intimates (*uchi*) includes relatively free expression of emotions and needs (*honne*) and by non-verbal, unrestrained exchange of support (*amae*). Social distance decreases intimacy; prompting people to communicate using polite deference (*enryo*) in order to avoid offending the higher-status person. Strict rules of reciprocity between non-intimates include the edict that each favor incurs a reciprocal exchange. Therefore, the social exchange norm in Japanese culture is to ask for help only within one's intimate social group (Bachnik, 1994; Hendry, 1992; Lebra, 1976; Saint Arnault, 2002). Smooth functioning within the group requires a person to sensitively assess each context and one's role within it. One important task for a Japanese person involves appropriate role behavior. Behaviors that foster conflict or indicate deviance are frowned upon, and may result in ostracism (Bestor, 1996; Johnson, 1995; Smith, 1961).

# **THE CONTEXT OF HEALTH: ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL FACTORS**

#### **The Japanese Health Care System**

In the 1999 fiscal year, the Japanese health government social security expenditures totaling 75.0 trillion yen (Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts, and Telecommunications, 2002). According to the WHO, in 1998, Japan's health care expenditure was 7.5% of its GDP (World Health Organization, 2002a) (see Table 2). Like other nations with national health care coverage, Japan pays over 78% of its health care expenditures with public monies; of these monies, over 89% come from social security revenues. Private expenditures are 77% out-of-pocket, as Japan uses virtually no private insurance.

Japan maintains a westernized, technological health care system, and has as many or more physicians and nurses than the industrialized nations selected for this chapter (see Figure 1). Another interesting difference is the higher number of pharmacists per 100,000 in Japan, which may be related to factors such as the heavy use of pharmaceuticals in Japan, the health care payment structure, governmental support of medical technology research

and development and limited cost control monitoring (Steslicke, 1987) (see Figure 2).

#### **Morbidity and Mortality**

In 1999, the average life expectancy was 77.10 years for men and 83.99 years for women, the highest level in the world. Infant mortality rate in 1990 fell to 3.4 per 1,000. The three leading causes of mortality in 1999 were malignant neoplasms (cancer), heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease, with 29.6% of all deaths due to cancer (Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare, 2002; World Health Organization, 2002a) (see Figure 3). The rise in cancer, heart disease, and cardiovascular diseases since the 1950 is probably related to an increased exposure to the risks of poor diet, pollution, work related threats, and stress. A comparison of international disease trends reveals that Japan ranks high among these nations in cardiovascular accidents (strokes), digestive diseases, chronic liver diseases, external causes of death, and suicide. However, Japan ranks lower in diseases of the circulatory system and heart attacks (see Figure 4). The symbolic prominence of the stomach and abdomen as the seat of the self for Japanese plays a role in the perception of somatic distress (Ohnuki-Tierney, 1984). This symbolic seat is different from that seen in the West, where heart and the blood are symbolic centers. For example, interview data reveal a concept of "swallowing sadness," noting that concealing the true self for the sake of social harmony may create a symbolic, but somatic, abdominal form. In the West, the cultural prominence of syndromes such as type A personality and hostility may be similarly related to cardiovascular disease and heart attacks.

### **Mental Illness and Suicide**

In 1999, the largest total number of patients in hospitals per 100,000 were tied between mental illnesses and circulatory diseases (259 each) (Health Statistics Division, 1999). However, the Japanese tend not to use outpatient mental health services. Mental illnesses rank second to the lowest number of patients using outpatient services (at 124 per 100,000) compared with digestive disorders (at 1198 per 100,000). Most of the mental hospital beds are occupied by persons diagnosed with schizophrenias (68.6%), then dementia  $(6.4\%)$ , mood disorders  $(5.5\%)$ , and alcohol dependence  $(5.0\%)$ . The incidence of neurosis, depression, psychosomatic disorders, and other mental illnesses can be attributed to urbanization and the related stress (Ministry of Health, 2002). Suicide is a major source of concern for Japanese men (see Figure 5). The rise in the rates for men aged 35-55 are probably related to the economic downturn in the 1990. While Japan's suicide rates for men are higher than some nations, they compare favorably with those of the former Soviet Republic and many Eastern block countries (see Figure 6).

## MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS

Japan's primary medical system is western biomedicine. The government sponsored medical scholars to study Dutch medicine and translate German medical texts in the 1700s. In the late 1800s, the Japanese government formalized the adoption of the German medical system of medical training and medical care delivery (Long, 1987).

The second system, *Kampo*, was formalized in Japan during the Heian period (794–1192). Rooted in Traditional Chinese Medicine, *Kampo* is a uniquely Japanese healing system. Despite periods of decline, in the 1950s the government granted *Kampo* official status and governmental regulation. One aspect of the regulation is that practitioners must have a medical degree before becoming a certified *Kampo* doctor (Ohnuki-Tierney, 1984; Rister, 1999). Almost 77% of Japanese physicians have used *Kampo* medicine, and nearly 60% of physicians surveyed considered *Kampo* to be the best choice for certain diseases (Long, 1987; Rister, 1999). Currently, *Kampo* has educational institutions, journals, a scientific presence and development corporations, as well as national insurance coverage for some types of *Kampo* treatment, including *Kampo* hospitals and clinics.

# **CLASSIFICATION OF ILLNESS, THEORIES OF ILLNESS, AND TREATMENT OF ILLNESS**

The primary concept in *Kampo* is balance in the entire physical, mental, social, and emotional state. *Kampo* practitioners gather information about subtle aspects of personal experience, such as cravings, warm or cold sensations, sweating, eye, nose, and mouth states such as dryness, redness or congestion, digestive changes, energy level, quality of sleep and the like. Causes of imbalances include both internal and external pathogens, such as wind, cold, heat, dampness, improper diet, or overwork. The state or condition is then understood according to three sets of complementary sets of indicators—hot: cold, excess: deficiency, and internal: external. Hot and cold refers to the experience of temperature throughout the body, as well as under or over activity of physiological processes. Excesses and deficiencies refer to the constitutional state of the person, including the degree of vitality, resistance to stress and imbalance, and energy level. Finally, internal: external refers to the location of the pathogenic processes, and attunes the practitioners to the "depth" of the problem. Internal problems indicate that pathogenic situation has existed longer and the problem is more entrenched. In addition to these complementary states of balance, *Kampo* is concerned with blood flow, bodily fluids, and vital energy (*qi*). Bodily fluids and *qi* need to circulate freely and can become blocked or stagnant, causing states of illness.

*Kampo* treatment is indicated when multiple organs are affected, such as in immune disorders or in the failing health of the elderly, and when the patient's condition does not have a ready biomedical diagnosis or effective treatment, such as is the case in psychosomatic illness or idiosyncratic illness expressions. Finally, they are widely used as alternative and complementary treatments to biomedicine (Long, 1987; Ohnuki-Tierney, 1984; Rister, 1999; Tsumura, 1991; Yamamura, 1987).

### **Sexuality and Reproduction**

Japanese women are socially expected to be modest, polite, and deferent to men, consistent with sexual hierarchy and social propriety. The social prescriptions to avoid open display of emotion or private feelings creates a climate that discourages public discussion of sexuality, and schools do not teach family planning or sex education. Despite the ethos of modesty and propriety, sex hotels, prostitution and pornography, including provocative, explicit, and often violent *manga* (comic books) are widely available. As Japanese women have become more assertive about their rights and legal protection, they have complained about sexual advances at work and in public areas, such as trains. During field experiences in the mid 1990s, sexually explicit advertisements were common on trains; in 2002, they were much less present. However, sexually explicit *manga* and advertisements in newspapers are still common. The molestation of women on trains is such a problem that some train lines offer women-only cars during rush hour.

The concept of the "good wife and wise mother" (ryosai kempo) historically saw women as productive members of society, with important roles in the family and the community. In the last 40 years, though, the mothering role has become increasingly important in self-definition, and as a foci of resistance among women (Lock, 1987; Rosenberger, 2001). Women in the last few decades are marrying later and having fewer children. Still, most women do have one or two children, and devote substantial amounts of patience, energy, devotion, and personal sacrifice to them.

Methods of birth control have been primarily male condoms in Japan. The availability of the birth control pill was an issue of rancor and concern for the Japanese people and their government. The birth control pill was finally legal for sale in Japan in 1999, however, a survey of over 1,500 women found that only 4% of Japanese women use

**Figure 7.** Japan fetal death rates per 100,000 by year and cause (Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare, 2002).

this method, compared with 87% in the United States and 93% in Germany (Pharmacia, 2001). A physician must monitor the use of the pill regularly, and it is not covered by the national health insurance. Other forms of birth control have included infanticide and abortion in historical Japan (Cornell, 1996). Figure 7 depicts the prevalence of abortion in Japan since 1940. The highest periods of the practice were in the 1960s, and the practice has decreased somewhat, but remains a means of birth control in modern Japan. Abortion is not taken lightly, but is considered an extreme and painful necessity to provide for the security and health of surviving members, and is often accompanied by ritual and lifelong grief.

The death of an unborn child, whether spontaneous or artificial, is marked by ritual in contemporary Japanese society (Klass & Heath, 1996–97; Namihara, 1987). The *Mizuko Kuyo* is a Buddhist ritual in which parents express regret and gratitude to their aborted children for their sacrifice for the family. Aborted fetuses are believed to have no connection with the living or ancestors. An unconnected spirit remains bound to the world, wandering about and feeling vengeful. These vengeful spirits can cause illness for the parents and the living children. One aspect of the ritual is to form connections with the spirit of the fetus and the *Jizu*, who is the guardian bodhisattva.

## **HEALTH THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE**

### **Pregnancy and Birth**

Women tend to give birth around 26–32 years, and 99% of women giving birth in 1992 were married (Miyaji & Lock, 1994). Pregnancy is both a natural act and a technological event in Japan. Pregnancy is considered a natural state in which daily events such as mood changes of the mother, changes in diet, and even the weather have important effects on the health of the child (Ohnuki-Tierney, 1984, 1989). With the advent of modern, westernized medicine, new mothers are encouraged to monitor the pregnancy carefully using the Maternal and Child Health Handbook (*boshitecho*). Women have monthly visits to the physician to monitor the baby's growth, usually with ultrasound. Mothers prefer to either return to their natal home to have the baby delivered, or have their mother or sister come to be with them for the birth and postnatal period. Almost all births happen within a medical facility, and 98% occur under physician supervision, with a full range of medical technology available. The birth tends to be without pain control, and episiotomies are routinely practiced (Miyaji & Lock, 1994; Yeo, Fetters & Maeda, 2000).

#### **Infancy**

Mothers tend to stay in the hospital for a week, but may remain confined to the house for as long as a month. About half of all Japanese mothers breast-feed, and women experience a great deal of anxiety about producing enough milk for the infant, fostering the use of therapeutic activities such as breast massage, heat applications, and supportive nursing care. The nursing event is considered a natural, intensely personal time for the mother and infant to connect in a nonverbal, mutually dependent way. Fathers, and Japanese society, believe that childcare is within the purview of women, and that the only one who can truly love and nurture an infant is its mother (Miyaji & Lock, 1994).

Maternal–infant bonding in Japan has been the subject of numerous international psychological studies (Shwalb & Shwalb, 1996). Japanese mothers quietly and physically reassure and interact with their baby, anticipating needs rather than waiting for the infant to signal needs. The intense bond formed during this period is part of the interdependent relationship pattern that will continue throughout life. This socialization pattern fosters individuation within an interdependent social frame. Throughout their lives, Japanese individuals enjoy periods of "refueling" into the indulgence of the intimate relationship, referred to as *amae* (Freeman, 1998).

### **Childhood**

As the child enters into toddlerhood, gendered differences in the maternal–child relationship have been noted (Freeman, 1998). Boys are rough, active, and vocal, receiving minimal interference from the mother. When the male child is disciplined, it tends to be with a gentle encouragement to be concerned about his role as the older brother (if appropriate) and to recognize that his behavior reflects on his family. Girls are expected to help the mother at a young age, and are encouraged to recognize their role in the home, and their role as a sweet, loving, polite daughter in public.

Children are rarely cared for outside of the home during their first few years. When mothers return to work, it tends to be after their children enter school. The child's schooldays are similar to that of adolescents, wearing uniforms, and commuting to school by train. Visitors to Japan are often enchanted by groups of well-groomed and well-behaved, eager, and boisterous children on trains and buses. Mothers are expected to prepare balanced, fresh foods for children, be involved in school activities and to devote their evenings to the children's studies.

#### **Adolescence**

The Japanese school year begins in April. The average high school day begins around 8:30 am. Since most people in Japan travel by rail, a teenager in Japan may leave home as early as 6:30 am. At the end of the day students are often involved in club activities. Consistent with the tendency for people in Japanese culture to affiliate with one primary group, Japanese students may join only one club. These clubs may be sports or culture clubs. The Confucian hierarchical relationship pattern of seniors and juniors is created and maintained during the club activities. It is the responsibility of the seniors (*senpai*) to teach, initiate, and take care of the juniors (*kohai*). It is the duty of the *kohai* to serve and defer to the *senpai*. Most of the interaction the typical adolescent has is with peers at school, on the long rides to and from school, and through phone and e-mail contact.

Japanese students spend as many as 240 days a year at school. In addition to this long school year, it is highly likely that students attend after school "cram schools" where approximately 60% of Japanese high school students go for supplemental lessons. These schools operate after school and extend into the evening, and require extra homework, leaving the Japanese adolescent little free time during the week. Tuition for these schools is expensive and parents may carefully select and pay for the highest level of schools affordable. Parents and adolescents accept this burden on their time, effort and finances because admission to a good university can be a primary factor in the success of a Japanese adult, determining employment opportunities, and future income. Students who fail an entrance examination may feel as though they have failed their family and experience intense worries about their future, making them a highly vulnerable sector of Japanese youth (Johnson & Johnson, 1996; Rohlen, 1983; White, 1993).

The behavioral problems of Japanese adolescents have risen throughout the 1980s and 1990s at an alarming rate. Many of these problems, including truancy, rebelliousness in school and school refusal, can be seen as social reactions to the incredible stress of life in a conformist society, where academic success is held to be the most important social goal. The school-refusal syndrome is characterized by somatic complaints of headaches and stomachaches, followed by refusal to go to school, moodiness, and sometime verbal and physical abuse of parents. The child may then become listless, depressed, withdrawn, and remain secluded in their rooms. These somatic symptoms, passive resistance, and retreatism are consistent with the Japanese forms of resistance in the face of social pressure which cannot be directly changed (Lock, 1987).

Some of these behavioral changes may also be related to the modern ambivalence toward Japanese cultural rules, and the westernization of Japanese cultural expectations. One example is the problem of bullying (*ijime*). One survey found that 31% of third-graders, 25% of fourth-graders, 13% of fifth-graders, 10% of sixth-graders, 17% of seventh-graders, and 8% of eighth-graders are victims of *ijime* (U.S. Department of Education, 2002). One aspect of *ijime* is that students who

#### **References 775**

participate in it tend not to feel guilty about cruel acts in which they engage. This may be because *ijime* may be a modern distortion of the *senpai–kohai* relationship.

#### **The Aged**

The rapidly aging population has created a burden on the health care infrastructure of Japan. Much of the distresses related to the chronic illnesses described above are age related. The most controversial element of the burgeoning heath care needs of the elderly is about who should provide their care. Japan has only recently begun to create an institutional infrastructure to accommodate these needs (Health Statistics Division, 1999). Instead, the Japanese government has called upon a reawakening of the traditional structure of the Japanese family and the Confucian ideal of filial piety among the citizenry. This expectation leaves the burden of long term care of the elderly to the women in Japanese society.

Another facet of the burden of care is the cultural expectation of dependency. Japanese patients, especially the chronically ill or elderly, are expected to remain dependent. Western models of rehabilitation for the purpose of self-care are considered inappropriate. The concept that an elder may become bedridden, and be cared for by family, is alive in the Japanese consciousness. Even when an infirmed elderly person is in a facility, or when they live with family members, all present hold no expectation that they will resume self-care (Keifer, 1987; Shibusawa & Mui, 2001). One example of this phenomenon is the average length of stay in Japan's hospitals is 38.3 days, compared with 8 days in the United States (Keifer, 1987; Sonoda, 1988), suggesting an expectation of dependency.

Another aspect of the plight of the elderly and the chronically ill in Japan, as in much of the west, is that these conditions do not respond to technological advances. In Japan, fortunately, there is an alternative health care system, *Kampo*, which specializes in chronicity and quality of life. *Kampo* medicines are often paid for by the national insurance, and it is common for the elderly to seek *Kampo* (Keifer, 1987; Sonoda, 1988).

### **Dying and Death**

The concept of pollution is at the heart of most funeral rituals. Japanese culture has well articulated notions of pollution and rituals devoted to the eventual restoration of purity, particularly within the Shinto religion. Contact with death, especially in the material realms, such as utensils and clothing, are important places for ritual intervention. One way that people have historically provided protection from pollution is through reversal—that is, object, patterns, furniture, dishes—are placed on the opposite side or in reverse during the funeral period. Spirits of the dead are believed to wander about the earth until they are appeased. Eating and drinking among the living provide protection during this vulnerable, transitional state, and food and drink are available as offerings to the spirits of the newly deceased. There is usually a wake the day of the death, with burial of cremated remains in a family area of the cemetery the day after the death. Rituals may occur as often as weekly until the 49th day. The family member is remembered with a blessed placard bearing their name placed with the other family names in the family gravesite. Families often have a Buddhist altar in the home, with photos of the deceased. Remembrances yearly and at special days throughout the year are marked by rituals including the offering of incense and prayers. The altar also bears other symbolic elements, including salt, *sake*, water, and rice. Some families also practice a Shinto purification ritual of "pouring water," (misogi) at the family gravesite. This might be the responsibility of the wife of the eldest son, but, more generally, the wife of the household nearest to
