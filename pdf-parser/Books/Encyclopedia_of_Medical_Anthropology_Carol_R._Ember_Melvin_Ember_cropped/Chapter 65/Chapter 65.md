and home economics schools (28,112). In the last two groups, the large majority of pupils are mentally handicapped, with the ratio of male to female 100 to 40.

#### The Aged

People in the republic seem to age faster and look older sooner than those of the same age in the United States. Because many have had a stressful life, they usually retire as soon as they become eligible. Widows and widowers sometimes live with one of their married children, but if their health and finances permit, are more likely to live an independent life in their own house or apartment, or in a retirement home. During 2000, 148 nursing homes with 12,129 beds were available for those pensioners who needed nursing services.

As for mortality age, in 2000 a full 7,118 men out of a total of 54,845 males died at 85 years of age or older; 16,734 out of a total of 54,119 females died at that age or older. The most common causes of death in 2000 were diseases of the circulatory system (53.39%), neoplasms (26.33%), external causes (injuries, poisoning, etc.; 6.49%), diseases of the respiratory system  $(4.55\%)$ , and diseases of the digestive system  $(3.89\%)$ .

### **Dying and Death**

Death is accepted as the inevitable end of a person's life and is particularly mourned if the person has died prematurely. More than half of the republic's population consider death as final; those who are religious believe in some sort of an existence beyond earthly life. Most people hope for a sudden, painless death, but in actuality many die in hospitals while being treated for a serious illness, usually associated with advanced age.

Prior to World War II, burial in the ground was as common as, or more common than, cremation. As of 2002, three fourths of the deceased are cremated—four fifths of those dying in Prague and about two thirds in Moravia. No special treatment of the body is performed except for preparing the face if the body is to be viewed before the funeral. In very exceptional cases, at the request of the family, the body may be embalmed. An autopsy is usually required in cases of death by accident or under unusual circumstances.

# Datoga

#### Astrid Blystad and Ole Bjørn Rekdal

## ALTERNATIVE NAMES

Datoga, Tatog, Tatoga, Datoog, and Mangati.

## LOCATION AND LINGUISTIC AFFILIATION

The core Datoga area has for several centuries been the Hanang and Mbulu Districts of Arusha Region in northern Tanzania, but Datoga groups are spread over much of Tanzania in small localized enclaves.

Datoga is a Southern Nilotic language. The various subsections have different dialects which are internally comprehended among all Datoga.

## OVERVIEW OF THE CULTURE

### The Size of the Population

The size of the Datoga population is rather uncertain owing to the lack of ethnic variables in recent censa and to the

considerable dispersion of Datoga throughout Tanzania. The Datoga population of Hanang District has been estimated at 30,000 (Lane, 1996), but the total number of Datoga in Tanzania is probably several times that number.

### **Economy and Occupations**

Datoga are pastoral in the sense that there is an immense cultural emphasis on cattle. The cultural elaboration of cattle does not mean, however, that Datoga have large herds. Except for a smaller number of rich cattle owners, the majority of Datoga today have merely a few head of cattle and increasing numbers have no cattle at all. With decimated herds, farming has become increasingly important for Datoga, and nearly every Datoga household in Hanang cultivates a smaller or larger plot of maize, beans, and/or sorghum. A large repertoire of myths with degrading descriptions of cultivation and cultivators nonetheless flourish.

### **Social and Political Conditions**

Many Datoga have started to wear modern Tanzanian cotton dress, but the traditional and still commonly used dress is the bead-decorated leather cape and the leather skirt (*hanang'weanda*), a skirt which is vested with immense social and religious significance. Women carry heavy brass and bead decorations, while both sexes often have large facial scarification around the eyes and large extended earlobes with wooden or brass ornaments.

A husband and his wife or wives and their children and his old mother make up the prototypical inhabitants of a Datoga homestead. The traditional compound is characterized by a low flat-roofed men's house, several women's houses, and various animal dwellings placed in a half circle within a high thorn fence.

Datoga communities are linked together through rules and regulations that are enforced by an elaborate system of ad hoc meetings. The most common meeting is the "open meeting" (*geetabwaraku* or *girgweageeda emeeda*) which in practice is a male forum. The "clan meeting" (*girgweageeda doshta*), the "neighborhood meeting" (*girgweageeda gischeuuda*), the "youth meeting" (*girgweageeda gharemanga*), and the "married women's meeting" (*girgweageeda gademga*) are other examples.

## **Family and Kinship**

Datoga have, like other East African pastoralists, commonly been described as polygynous, patrilineal with a strong "warrior" tradition and male domination of social and political life. With renewed focus on pastoral communities in recent writings a more nuanced picture has appeared. In writings on Datoga it has been pointed out that clan affiliation is retained throughout life for both men and women, socio-political responsibility include matri- as well as patrikin, a "dowry" institution facilitates that women as well as men receive gifts of livestock at the time of marriage, and that women are central actors in Datoga political and religious life (Blystad, 2000).

## **Religion**

Aseeta, the Datoga deity, appears as an androgynous, powerful, and inherently good deity, invested with immense creative potential. Communication between human beings and the deity takes place with female and male spirits (*meang'ga*) as mediators. The spirits are more closely involved in people's lives than Aseeta. Aseeta and the spirits are particularly powerfully addressed by married Datoga women or "women who wear the leather skirt" during the frequently arranged *ghadoweeda* ritual ("people seeking blessing"), a ritual located at the heart of Datoga "tradition."

# **THE CONTEXT OF HEALTH: ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL FACTORS**

During colonial times as well as in the post-independent Tanzania period, Datoga pastoralists were subject to attempts to do away with their way of life. Colonial discourse associated Datoga pastoralists with primitivism, barbarism, and savageness. The discourse was reflected in public executions, arbitrary imprisonment, forced conscription into the army, collective cattle fines, and discriminatory resource allocation. The colonial portrayal of Datoga influenced the attitudes and actions of neighboring populations, politicians, bureaucrats, journalists, and scientists in post-independent Tanzania.

The new state of Tanzania pursued these policies more rigorously with their swahilization, villagization, and education policies. The so-called "Operation Barabaig" in the 1970s developed into a dramatic encounter between Datoga and state employees, who forcefully removed the people from their homes and relocated them in villages.

#### **Classification of Illness, Theories of Illness, and Treatment of Illness 631**

The official discourse after independence in 1963 facilitated a new wave of agriculturalists moving into what was formerly Datoga grazing land, leading to serious conflicts and to ethnic clashes with large numbers of casualties. Mechanized farming was in particular encouraged by the new state. In 1970 the Tanzania Canada Wheat Project (TCWP) initiated the clearing of woodland above the Rift wall in what is now Hanang District. With the total allocation of some 100,000 acres of land for large-scale wheat farming during the 1970s and 1980s the problem of land shortage in the area was magnified. Adding to the impediment of land loss, the appropriation of Datoga land took place in a manner that caused reaction from both the national and the international community owing to its violations of human rights.

## **MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS**

The landscape of indigenous Datoga medical practitioners consists of primarily three categories: Daremgajeega, Bajuta, and Gijoodiga. Most male Datoga healers are Daremgajeega. Daremgajeega is the name of a particular clan of healers as well as of a group of healing clans. The other major group of male healers is called Bajuta (Bajuta being both a healing clan and a Datoga subsection).

The practices of the Daremgajeega and the Bajuta are often quite similar. A common healing session implies that the healer spits on his client's body for extended periods of time, usually on the back, breast, and belly. Spitting, in the characteristic way of sending showers of spit through the teeth, is always perceived to be a blessing among Datoga, but gains in significance when carried out by a healer. The spitting is usually combined with the use of mixtures of herbs and animal fat which are rubbed over the patient's body with slow massaging movements to soothing accompaniment of chanted prayers for blessing. Patients say their healers make them "calm down."

Daremgajeega and Bajuta healers use a large number of techniques in addition to the somewhat standardized sessions of spitting, application of medicine, and prayers in their attempts to cure their patients. Creative use of product from domestic animals, particularly from cows and bulls, goats, and sheep is essential for Datoga healers. This particularly includes a practice linked to the consumption of fatty soups served with or without meat, the consumption or the smearing of milk, gee, butter, or blood onto the body, and the application of hides, manure, urine, or blood on parts or over the entire body. Incisions with or without the extraction of blood with a cup and the burning of parts of the body are other practices that commonly leave Datoga bodies with numerous little black scars. Quarantine or moving of particular homesteads or neighborhoods for shorter or longer periods of time are also common strategies used to prevent the spread of contagious conditions.

Although female healers are fewer in number than male healers, they make up a significant part of the landscape of Datoga healers. The most important category of female healers is *gijoodiga* (singular: *gijocheanda*), women whose mothers are of the Bajuta clan. *Gijocheanda* is a medium through which suffering individuals can communicate with the spirits, plead for help, and receive response and advice from the spirits. This communication takes place during night-time séances when the spirits "crawl onto the back" of the *gijocheanda*.

The abilities of the *gijoodiga* will commonly be revealed when they are still young due to peculiar conduct. Rigorous training is nonetheless required before a *gijocheanda* acquires proficiency in calling forth the voices of the living spirits. Some women of the Ghawooga, Hilbaghambowaida, or Bajuta clans may also in rare instances have special healing or spiritual abilities, but they are not as numerous as the *gijoodiga*.

Indeed, a prominent feature of the complex cultural environment of Mbulu and Hanang is that healing is often sought from individuals with foreign ethnic affiliation. Such cross-cultural therapeutic relationships are often established in spite of the fact that the ethnic groups involved have a long history of mutual hostility (Rekdal, 1999). Commonly consulted non-Datoga healers come from the Iraqw, Nyaturu, Rangi, Sukuma, and Tanga ethnic groups, as are health personnel at official or mission dispensaries, health stations, and hospitals.

# **CLASSIFICATION OF ILLNESS, THEORIES OF ILLNESS, AND TREATMENT OF ILLNESS**

#### **"Illness of God"/"Illness of Man"**

There is a distinction made between "illness of God" (*Geyooda Aseeta*), and "illness of human beings" (*geating siida*). But Datoga illness classifications are ambiguous and internally inconsistent; most illnesses can be classified into both categories depending on the circumstances.

#### **Witchcraft, Evil Eye, and Curse**

The prototypical illnesses located in the category "illness caused by humans" are conditions caused by witchcraft, evil eyes, curses, and the use of poison or other dangerous remedies. Datoga consider themselves to have few witches, but witchcraft is nonetheless said to cause increasing harm to the health and prosperity of people, animals, and plant life due to the escalating proximity in relations between Datoga and their Iraqw, Iramba, and other neighbors. A related and not less frightening skill among some Datoga is "the evil eye." The evil eye can, with a mere glimpse, but more commonly with lengthy staring at its target, cause illness, death, and dying.

Curses commonly hit Datoga individuals who fail to adhere to fundamental Datoga norms of respect, and are commonly carried out by male or female meetings after the individual is given ample opportunities for redress. Curses cause social isolation of an individual as they are extended to persons who co-operate with the cursed individual.

#### **Fever**

Malaria and tuberculosis (TB) are conditions typically categorized as "illnesses of God." Living in a harsh and disease-ridden environment, malaria and TB are common conditions among Datoga of Hanang and Mbulu, and with relatively little variation, the theoretization and treatment linked to these conditions are similar to those of a whole range of common illnesses in the area. Normal fever conditions are distinguished from intermittent fever and fever in combination with bloody cough and weight loss as in TB.

These conditions receive similar treatment consisting of a combination of drinking of melted butter/gee, eating fatty soups cooked on beef meat, and drinking of herbal mixtures. The herbs utilized vary somewhat from one illness condition to the next. The aim of this treatment is to cause diarrhea and vomiting in order to expel the harmful substances from the body. For the pure fever conditions the drinking cow's, bull's, or goat's urine is added to make the expulsion more efficient. With worsening conditions patients suffering from any of these conditions may eventually be sent to hospital, but many Datoga choose hospitals as a last option, and their health may have severely declined by the time they arrive.

#### **Physical Handicaps**

Conditions that are particularly feared among Datoga are illnesses linked to burning, severe bleeding, acute diarrhea, and conditions affecting the bones, all conditions which may be attributed to either the will of God or to human agency. The last condition warrants a few remarks owing to its particular elaboration among Datoga.

The birth of malformed babies, that is, babies lacking fingers or toes or entire limbs, or accidents causing such losses, are particularly feared among Datoga. Such handicaps have caused expulsion and fear of infants as well as of adults throughout the known history of Datoga.

The fear of a person without a finger, "without feet," or without other "bony" parts of the body, must be understood with reference to the connection made between such conditions and a clan's poor semen. In Datoga semen is thought to be the substance that builds the bony structures of a body, and hence malformed bones imply poor contribution by the genitor and in extension by his clan. What is important in this context is that such an "incomplete" condition can be transmitted to others, particularly through the sharing of meals.

The fear of incomplete bones make Datoga shun amputations, which at times cause flights from hospitals. Severe and lengthy ritual activity carried out by Datoga healers is the only remedy that, to some extent, can cleanse individuals with such handicaps. Other categories of handicap, such as deafness, dumbness, or blindness are not feared. Individuals with such handicaps are rather often located at the heart of Datoga ritual life.

#### **Illness of the Bones**

Another and somewhat related condition to the one we just described is called "bones" (*geaka*) which strikes an individual who either purposely or accidentally kills a fellow Datoga. Such an act is said to be so grave that it enters into a man's bones—and in extension the semen which is to produce new "bony structures." The condition follows him for three generations, and in practice expels him from life in Datoga communities.

# **SEXUALITY AND REPRODUCTION**

Datoga men and women intensely desire children. Both men and women need children to achieve adult status, and they gain prestige and influence with the birth of

#### **Health through the Life Cycle 633**

every additional child. A man or woman who dies without a son and a daughter, may never be given the honor of an "official" Datoga funeral (*bunged*), an ultimate goal among Datoga of this part of Tanzania. For fear of envy, great secrecy surrounds the fecundity of a compound, and the total number of children and cattle can only be traced with great difficulty. Any kind of population control in the married population is a highly foreign concept among Datoga who follow traditional religious concepts and ideals.

A woman's future is closely linked with her own ability to conceive and successfully give birth. Pressure to successfully conceive and give birth may follow a woman throughout her entire reproductive life if she fails to fulfill the goal of having at least one son and one daughter. A newly married woman will often have several sexual partners, classified as "brothers" of her husband, in order to ensure her first pregnancy. The younger "brothers" of her husband are usually particularly welcome in the young woman's house, as the "blood is often warm between them" and "the seeds of young men are good."

There is a strong belief that all women can conceive, although some may have problems carrying through a pregnancy or giving birth, due to the "will of *Aseeta*" or influences of "bad humans." If time goes by and there is no sign of a forthcoming offspring, a woman will set about seeking answers and cures. A husband is usually eager to cooperate in their wives' attempts to seek a cure against barrenness which often implies the spending of large amounts of wealth for treatment.

The status of a childless woman will remain ambiguous throughout her life, and her husband may demand a divorce. It is more common, however, that a woman who has difficulties conceiving will divorce her husband and remarry, in the hope that a new husband and his "brothers" may bring her better fortune. A childless couple will commonly receive a child or two from kin who are "rich in children."

## **HEALTH THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE**

#### **Pregnancy and Birth**

**The Physical Growth of a Fetus.** Semen and a woman's blood are considered to gradually thicken into a mass which forms the fetus. The blood produces the soft parts such as the flesh and blood, while the semen produces the white bony parts, namely the spine, bones, and skull.

For its growth, the child is said to be dependent upon a continuous supply of blood, as the fetus "nurses its mothers blood." The fetus is also said to benefit from the periodic addition of sperm for the growth of the bones and simultaneously to the development of hard, male qualities such as a tall and erect body posture, and a woman will therefore usually welcome sexual contact during a pregnancy.

Though fundamental in procreation, blood and sperm are both potentially destructive fluids that can harm the unborn child if contaminated by bad substances. A woman must watch her diet as "her blood becomes what she eats" and sperm may in some instances be too "strong" for a child in the womb and may cause the fetus to sicken and die. During the last couple of months of a pregnancy, the addition of sperm should cease completely since the sperm at this point unproductively merges with the milk in the mother's body and breasts.

**Diet during Pregnancy.** A pregnant woman strives to get the foods she craves for since these "go well together with the child inside." Raw blood products are desired by the pregnant woman as "they increase her blood"; whenever a slaughter has taken place, raw blood is served to the visibly pregnant. Generally speaking, the common diet of maize porridge, maize soup, and milk, with the periodic adding of millet and beans, is usually not altered dramatically during a pregnancy. In fact, far more attention appears to be given to the persons a pregnant woman eats with than with the actual food she consumes.

**Precautions taken by the Pregnant.** A pregnant Datoga woman considers herself to be surrounded by human beings, substances, and states that may harm her unborn child. There are certain sights that should be avoided by a pregnant woman at any cost; this applies to people, animals, or items that look peculiar or damaged, such as, for example, crawling snakes, broken pots or calabashes, and persons who are crippled. This fear of looking at people who do not have complete bodies—or, more seriously, of eating together with them—is not limited to pregnant women, but this fear takes on new proportions during pregnancy since the shape and character of the "soft" or "watery" child in the womb can easily be influenced by such abnormality. Foul smells, frightening sounds, or odd sensations are also shunned during pregnancy. When severe illness occurs during pregnancy, a sheep or a goat is commonly slaughtered in order to cook nourishing soup for the woman, and in due course the assistance of healers is sought.

Itself so vulnerable and dependant, the child in the womb may also be demanding and a source of potential peril. Indeed, a pregnant women's body is considered to be inhabited by a tiny strong-willed human being who has the ability to make her ill or even cause her death. Thus, a pregnant woman may experience herself as being vulnerable to both external and internal forces. Her leather skirt is tied tightly around her womb in a manner that pushes her growing belly downwards. "We close the womb with the leather skirt" informants would say, indicating the way they seek to prevent the unruly fetus from engaging in unproductive wild play. In addition, this technique prevents her condition from becoming visible until the final stages of pregnancy, thereby reducing the danger of evil eyes.

**Stuck Pregnancy (***Muldeaneeda***).** In Datoga experience, a fetus may suddenly cease to develop, in which case the child becomes stuck in the maternal womb (*muldeaneeda*). In such instances the woman experiences symptoms of pregnancy, but the fetus ceases to develop due to bleeding which leads to insufficient nourishment for the child. For years the child may "hide" in the back of a woman's womb "feeding on her body," leaving her thin and weak. Some women are bothered throughout their entire lives by recurring *muldeaneeda*, some of which are said to simply die off, while others are eventually born. Children that are born after years of *muldeaneeda*, are often given the names Gidamulda (male) or Udamulda (female), and these children are particularly adored, since their births relieve their mothers of years with pain and anxiety. The immense admiration of these children is moreover related to their alleged potency.

**Miscarriage and Infant Death.** Other dreaded outcomes of a pregnancy include miscarriages and the death of nursing infants. Such deaths are considered to be frightful, and constitute severe breaches in what is perceived to be the correct development: from conception through pregnancy and birth to convalescence and nursing. Such events produce "dirt" and those who are going to "eat the dirty condition"—usually the woman, her children, and sometimes her husband—are isolated in separate enclosures (*ghawiida*), in principle until a new pregnancy is ensured. Isolation is necessary because such events are considered to be contagious and can harm the potential fertility of others.

*Ghawiida* is part of the elaborate Datoga seclusion practices (*metiida*). *Metiida* involve the isolation of people and compounds for varying periods of time in order to prevent "dirt" from entering fertile processes. The most common conditions requiring a quarantine are deaths, abnormal births, conception outside of marriage, and conditions that require the purification or healing of people, places, or activities.

The most serious type of *metiida* is the *ghawiida jeapta* related to the death of a nursing infant, a stillbirth, or a miscarriage. It is particularly the milk dripping from the woman's breast that is feared. In contrast to the milk received by nursing infants, the unproductive mother's milk that drips from a woman's breasts after the death of a nursing infant is perceived as being entirely bad and infertile.

In principle, only a new pregnancy has the power to fully remove *ghawiida jeapta*, and a woman who does not become pregnant may remain in an ambiguous position, being neither completely clean nor completely dirty. A woman who experiences recurrent miscarriages or infant deaths will "have dirt" and substantial restrictions will be placed on her social conduct to the extent that years of her life may be spent isolated behind high thorn fences.

**Giving Birth.** There are commonly a number of older women ready to assist a woman in labor, and news about a woman who is about to give birth causes immediate moves by neighborhood women who move in to take part at this precarious time.

The woman in labor is placed in a half sitting, half hanging position, holding onto a rope which is hanging from the low ceiling. The rope the woman holds onto is fastened close to the fire "so that her blood can be heated and the delivery speeded up." Her feet are firmly planted on the large hide on her bed, with her leather skirt placed on top of it. With small modifications, a woman commonly remains in this position throughout the delivery. The midwife will fasten and unfasten a leather thong around the woman's abdomen—following the rhythms of labor—in order to increase the downward movement. She will also massage the woman's back and repeatedly change the position of her legs.

After the birth of the child, the leather strap is again carefully fastened around the womb to speed up the expulsion of the placenta. When the placenta appears it is

#### **Health through the Life Cycle 635**

closely inspected. The umbilical cord is then cut with a knife before the wound is covered with cow dung to heal. Later the placenta is placed in the cattle enclosure, while the remnants of the umbilical cord are tied to the foot of a heifer.

Both breech births and twin births are feared among Datoga. After such abnormal births there will be no *ghawiida* since no death has occurred, but the compound is isolated for 6–8 days. Despite their relatively light isolation, a breech birth is regarded as a most serious matter, and several of the practices that follow such a birth imply associations with death. The later consequences for the child are, moreover, serious, since the person may have difficulties finding a marital partner. Children born in breech births will also appear unpopular on the marital market. Twin births are commonly followed by the brewing of honey mead and diverse ritual activity which aims at "separating" the two children.

Increasing number of Datoga women will give birth at a health center or at a hospital.

#### **Infancy**

The sensation of having calmed down after birth is soon followed by another unsafe phase, post-natal convalescence (*ghereega*)—the months during which the woman is to regain her strength, and the infant is to face its initial harsh encounter with the world. *Ghereega* is a new liminal phase which is associated with almost total seclusion of the mother and infant in the low, dark, private room of the mother for a period of 2 months after the birth of a boy, and 3 months after the birth of a girl.

During the months the woman remains inside, she focuses on ensuring her own and her child's health. The midwife commonly stays on with the mother until the first peril is passed, and until a male goat has been selected, strangled, and butchered, and the "song of the child" initiated. A girl is then commonly selected to stay with her and assist her. Some women will move outside with care after the remnants of the umbilical cord have fallen off, but they usually remain close to the compound. In such cases she places her baby deep in a leather sling, and if the child is a boy she carries an arrow and a ritual stick for protection. If she meets a stranger she will commonly look at the ground or bend down to signal that she does not want contact.

A woman will generally let her infant suckle whenever it cries. However, breastfeeding does not begin immediately after the birth of a child. Water is substituted for mother's milk the first 2–5 days of an infant's life, or until every sign of the meconium, the first black feces of the child, has passed. Our informants would explain that water cleanses the infant's stomach. This practice cannot be understood without a fundamental recognition of water as a sacred life-giving source; rain water is referred to as "the spit of Aseeta" (*ng'usheanda Aseeta*). The feeding of the unboilt water causes diarrhea in many new-born Datoga babies.

Cow's milk, when available, is usually given a couple of days later in combination with mother's milk. When a mother starts to nurse her child, therefore, she also makes an effort to get some cow's milk. Mother's milk and cow's milk ideally provide the sole nourishment for the child the first year.

Milk has tremendous cultural significance among Datoga. Feeding the child cow's milk is crucial in order to gain the experience of sharing bodily substance with livestock, and is perceived as initiating a life-long pastoral education, implying the instilling of embodied, pastoral knowledge in the child. Later on ghee, butter, meat, and blood will be added to the diet. Despite the ideals of feeding Datoga infants cow's milk, Datoga mothers of Hanang and Mbulu are often forced to feed even tiny children maize-soup, soft maize-porridge, or bean stew since the shortage of cow's milk often becomes acute in the dry season.

Mother's milk and the flows that exist between the mother and her child during the period of nursing are considered to be inherently good, intimate, and nourishing. However, this milk is thought to be liable to be contaminated by other substances that enter the mother's body. Bad food, bad sperm, or other bad substances have the potential to negatively affect the quality of a woman's breast milk.

A Datoga woman commonly nurses her child for at least a year, and often up to two years. While the woman is nursing the child, the two are perceived to be "one," just as they were while the child was still in the womb. The intimate links between the two bodies during pregnancy are thus extended throughout the period of breastfeeding. The separation of the two bodies is said to start first after weaning. As we saw above, the death of a still-nursing infant requires that precautions parallel to those associated with a miscarriage be taken; and these events differ fundamentally from the way the death of a weaned child is handled. The notions that a mother and child "are one body" as long as the child is breastfeeding, and that death of a suckling child is like a delayed miscarriage have also been noted among neighboring peoples such as Iraqw and Maasai (Rekdal, 1996, p. 376; Spencer, 1988, p. 41).

The new mother will also spend a substantial amount of time studying every inch of the baby's body. She makes sure the painful but necessary burning of the infant's skull is carried out to "hasten the closing of the fontanels," and should the infant suffer from pains in the chest or stomach, she may allow the same treatment of burning to take place again, often leaving the little child with numerous small burn marks. She selects charms to hang on the baby's body to protect it from the first dangers of life. A weak baby girl may at this early point in her life be circumcized "in order to prevent further illness." While in seclusion a new mother spends cherished time on the composition of the "song of the child," which was initiated by the midwife. The mother holds her baby close while rocking her upper body slowly back and forth, thus providing it with soothing sounds and soft movements.

#### **Childhood**

The custom of mutating the physical body for beauty, socialization, or preventive health purposes takes place throughout childhood. The most common practices include the initiation of a process of extending the earlobes, the removal of the two lower incisors, and circumcision of both girls and boys.

The mandatory removal of the clitoris and labia minora is commonly carried out when a girl is between 2 and 5 years of age. This painful operation is carried out by a local elderly woman with only a handful of women present in the homestead. The incident is not talked about much and receives no cultural elaboration. This appears in stark contrast to male circumcision, which is a grand ritual occasion characterized by the brewing of large quantities of honey mead, sung prayer, and dancing. The operation takes place when boys are between 5 and 12 years old. Large numbers of boys, sometimes several hundred, are circumcized at the same occasion. The operation itself is commonly carried out with a knife or razor blade, and is followed by the feeding of milk and blood for the boys to regain their strength.

### **Adolescence**

Youth is a time when Datoga pay substantial attention to their maturing bodies, and spend time on modifying it for beautifying purposes. For example, earlobes are extended with large wooden earrings and large facial scarifications are commonly inscribed around the eyes.

Particularly intricate and poetic youth talk takes place between potential boy/girlfriends. A man who fails to encourage the continuation of the relationship through dialogue may attempt to win a girl's heart through a spearing in the *lilicht* tradition, a traditional hunt for dangerous animals (usually a lion) linked up with youthful fertility.

Although sexual play is an integral part of youth activity, norms prohibit a couple from carrying out sexual penetration while the girl is unmarried. The norm is related to the absolute condemnation of children born without clan affiliation on the father's side. Indications of breaches of the sexual norm, and rumors that a particular girl "has become a woman," may lead to her being required to undergo a physical checkup by a group of older women, and they may conclude that "the girl has now become like us," and should be married off immediately. Such incidences severely reduces a girl's chances of influencing the choice of her marital partner.

This is not to say that premarital sexual intercourse does not occur. Preventive measures such as *coitus interruptus* are common and remedies that cause abortion are known. But girls were generally said to be reluctant to agree to sexual intercourse. Medical personnel confirmed that virginity among unmarried Datoga girls is the rule rather than the exception.

### **Adulthood**

**Alcohol Consumption.** Datoga elders have customarily consumed the sacred honey mead primarily on ritual occasions and on grand occasions of festivity. Women and youth have according to Datoga custom not consumed alcohol. With the tremendous transformations taking place in Datoga communities, not the least with the increase in contact with outside peoples who brew a large variety of brews on which there is no customary restrictions, the consumption of alcohol has increased substantially. Youth and sometimes women may today be seen consuming non-indigenous brew, particularly on market days. The increase in alcohol consumption, the transformations of the people involved in the consumption, and of the timing and settings where the consumption takes place is readily addressed by the Datoga informant.

#### **References 637**

**Domestic Abuse.** Datoga have strong ideals of peaceful co-operation and complementarity between a husband and his wife, or wives, in order to ensure sound reproduction of a compound. Despite these ideals, however, conflicts between spouses and violent outbursts are common in many Datoga compounds. A generally accepted norm states that a man has the right to punish his wife or wives when they do not fulfill their obligations, and women will commonly defend their husband's abuse by referring to particular instances of lack of compliance or misconduct on their part.

There are however restrictions put on a husband's right to physically reprimand his wives, and men may be penalized by the female community when breaches occur where women experience their "procreative bodies," in the broad sense of the term, are infringed upon by male misbehavior. Such infringement must be instantly addressed lest all Datoga life suffer. The consequences of action taken by the married women's council (*girgweageeda gademga*) against a man who has seriously infringed upon women's fertile domain may be quite severe. The offender will not only be fined a rare and cherished black bull, but will be humiliated by the women in front of the entire community.

Any male interference at critical moments of procreation—such as mistreating or quarreling with a pregnant or convalescent woman, or watching the birth of a child, if not specifically summoned to assist as a member of a healing clan—are regarded as particularly serious offences. Serious argument arising over funds for the treatment of barrenness, miscarriage, or illness related to pregnancy, birth, or nursing may require action, as may male violence inside a Datoga woman's private room. Men's behavior also comes under the scrutiny of women following incidences of misconduct in relation to what are perceived as sacred female activities in connection with ritual gatherings. Female animals, not only livestock, but also domestic animals such as cats and dogs, are protected in ways parallel to women when they have kittens or puppies.

### **Dying and Death**

The treatment of dying persons who leave families and offspring behind them is colored by the notion that the person is soon to become a living guardian spirit; a condition requiring utmost respect and care.

Datoga fear corpses to the extent that individuals closely associated with the dead will be isolated for up to a year. The severe restrictions linked to miscarriages or deaths of still suckling infants were reviewed above. Deaths of spouses will experience a similar set of restrictions which imply that either the widow or widower experience months of isolation where they do not eat, work, or socialize with other than the potential person who might "eat the dirt" with them. Simultaneously they modify their dress, shave their hair, and remove all decoration except for a black bead necklace so their appearance becomes filthy.

The corpse is handled by female members of the household only. Dead bodies should ideally be placed in a horizontal position on a litter and carried to the east of the compound where it will be left to be "eaten" by the bush. The Government of Tanzania has prohibited the placing of corpses in the bush, and many Datoga will today bury the dead inside the compound even if a communal funeral is not held. Each year, however, a handful of deceased Datoga elders, both men and women, will be buried in grand communal funerals. In such instances the corpse is placed in a sitting, fetus-like position with the head bent toward the chest and the hands closed around the knees. The tomb that is to mark the grave for years to come is created in the image of a large pregnant female womb, which after 9 months "gives birth" to the new spirit. The funerary ritual is a ritual unique in scale and elaboration in Datoga culture.

The deceased who is to receive this honorary departure must have had many children, of whom at least one daughter and one son must be married and have children. The deceased must not have died "a bad death," which includes deaths caused by accidents, sudden diseases, severe bleeding, diarrhea, fire, or the breaking of bones. All limbs, including the fingers and toes, must be intact, without fractures or abnormalities such as the lack of a joint or even a fingernail. The most important criteria, however, are that the deceased is ritually clean, that is, is not suffering from "bones," which is related to homicide involving a fellow Datoga; and that the deceased comes from a wealthy family and clan. It is the male and female spirits born in such grand burials that are sought by "people seeking blessing" (*ghadoweeda*)—and whom Datoga informants consider themselves to be wholly dependent upon for health, wealth, and prosperity.
