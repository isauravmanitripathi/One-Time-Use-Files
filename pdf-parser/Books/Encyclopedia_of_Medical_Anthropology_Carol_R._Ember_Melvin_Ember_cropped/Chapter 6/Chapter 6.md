# **Forensic Anthropology**

#### Douglas H. Ubelaker

### DEFINITIONS

Forensic anthropology represents the application of our knowledge and techniques of physical anthropology to medico-legal problems. Historically, such applications have focused on skeletal remains, although issues involving soft tissue are at times included. With skeletal remains forensic anthropologists are asked to offer opinions if the evidence represents human, non-human animals, or other materials. If the remains are thought to be human, then analysis is directed toward such problems as determining the age at death, sex, ancestry, living stature, postmortem interval (time since death), anatomical parts represented, the presence of disease or injury and if so, any treatment of the conditions, any unusual features that might facilitate identification, any evidence of injury that might have contributed to death and postmortem change (Işcan & Kennedy, 1989; Krogman & İşcan, 1986; Maples and Browning, 1994; Rathbun & Buikstra, 1984; Reichs, 1998; Rhine, 1998; Stewart, 1970, 1979; Ubelaker, 1999a; Ubelaker & Scammell, 1992). Evidence of postmortem change is important because it can  $(1)$  contribute to the estimation of the time since death, (2) provide important environmental information to help determine the postmortem history of the remains, and (3) assist with perimortem (at or about the time of death) trauma interpretation (Haglund & Sorg, 2002).

Forensic anthropologists usually work closely with forensic pathologists and other specialists in forensic science in a team approach. Forensic anthropologists become involved in such work because of their unique experience and training in human skeletal biology, human variation, growth and development, and other anthropological areas of speciality. Although they usually work with human remains that have been altered through advanced decomposition or other factors, at times they also assist medical specialists in the autopsy of relatively complete remains in cases when anthropological expertise is needed.

#### HISTORY

The roots of forensic anthropology extend back to 19th-century interests in the biological basis of abnormal

behavior (Lombroso, 1887), Bertillonage (human identification using anthropometric measurements), and early anatomists and physicians called upon to examine human remains. Stewart (1979) has suggested that Thomas Dwight (1843–1911) deserves the title of "Father of Forensic Anthropology in the United States" for his 1878 essay on medical–legal identification of the human skeleton and other works (Dwight, 1878). Other notable early contributors were Jeffries Wyman (1814–1874), George Dorsey (1869–1931) and Harris Hawthorne Wilder (1864–1928) (Stewart, 1979; Ubelaker, 1999b).

Although the early pioneers of physical anthropology Alesˇ Hrdliˇcka (1869–1943) and Earnest A. Hooton (1887–1954) were involved in casework (Stewart, 1979; Ubelaker, 1999c), publication and professionalization of the field came later, largely through the work of Wilton M. Krogman (1903–1988) and T. Dale Stewart (1901–1997) (Ubelaker, 2000a, 2000b). Key factors in the development of forensic anthropology were the growth of skeletal collections supporting forensic research, routine consultation of Smithsonian anthropologists with the FBI, anthropological involvement with the military to assist in identification issues, formation of the Physical Anthropology Section of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences in 1972, and the formation of the American Board of Forensic Anthropology in 1977 (Snow, 1982; Ubelaker, 1997). By the year 2001, membership had grown to 252 in the Physical Anthropology Section and to 50 Diplomates recognized by the ABFA.

# **TRAINING**

Certification in the ABFA requires a Doctoral degree in Anthropology with an emphasis on Physical Anthropology and evidence of advanced study of human osteology, human anatomy, and dental anthropology. Such a requirement strongly suggests that forensic anthropologists receive their formal training in a PhD granting Department of Anthropology with an emphasis on the specialized areas mentioned. Training is also useful in archeological recovery techniques, appropriate legal issues, related areas of forensic science, and evidence handling. Experience with actual forensic cases is extremely important and usually is obtained by working with a practicing forensic anthropologist. Courses, workshops, fellowships, and internships are also available to

supplement formal programs and to provide exposure and experience in casework.

# **PRIMARY GOALS**

Usually, analysis in forensic anthropology is oriented toward two major goals: (1) establishing a profile of the individual represented that will assist in positive identification, and (2) the recognition and interpretation of evidence of foul play.

As mentioned above, the "identification profile" can involve determining that the remains are of human origin, estimation of age at death, sex, ancestry, living stature, general robusticity, the presence and treatment of medical conditions, and noting any unusual biological features that might be known about the once-living individual. The accumulation of such information helps narrow the search for the missing person and excludes individuals who do not fit the profile.

In cases of recent origin in which identification has remained elusive, a facial reproduction may be called for (Taylor, 2001; Ubelaker, 2000c). This involves generating an image of the head of the individual to be presented to the public through the media. Such a technique is used to reach out to the public for information about possible missing persons. Different techniques can be employed to generate such an image but most begin with markers placed on the skull to document the depth of the soft tissue at various places (Manhein et al., 2000). The anthropologist and/or artist then produces either a twodimensional or three-dimensional image of the person using various combinations of sculpture and/or computer techniques.

If a photograph of a suspected missing person is available, then it can be compared directly with a recovered skull through a process usually referred to as "photographic superimposition." Using video and computer equipment, specialists can directly compare the images and assess the extent to which they are consistent (Ubelaker, 2000d). This technique is used primarily for exclusion (to indicate that the skull and photograph represent different individuals), but its use has diminished (Ubelaker, 2000e) as more powerful molecular techniques for identification have become available.

Positive identification results when unique features are found on recovered remains that are known to have existed in a missing person. To establish positive

identification, the investigator must find the shared unique features and be able to explain any differences that occur. Although such identifications usually are made currently by experts working with DNA, dental restorations, or fingerprints, they also can stem from forensic anthropology. In particular, radiographs of the living person retrieved from medical records may reveal unique anatomical details that can be compared with recovered remains (Ubelaker, 1990) or other evidence (Fenger, Ubelaker, & Rubinstein, 1996).

Medical specialists are responsible for the determination of cause and manner of death. Forensic anthropologists can also be helpful in this effort through the recognition and interpretation of key evidence. Such evidence can take the form of blunt force trauma (Galloway, 1999), patterned trauma, sharp force trauma, or gunshot injury. The type of injury likely associated with cause and manner of death is termed perimortem, or occurring at or about the time of death. Such alterations have to be distinguished from those sustained antemortem (during the life of the individual) and postmortem (after death) (Ubelaker, 1991; Ubelaker & Adams, 1995). Such alterations also have to be distinguished from naturally occurring anatomical variants which are developmental in origin.

The postmortem alterations may not be related to cause and manner of death but they can reveal a great deal of information about time since death and the postmortem history of the remains. Such observations may provide environmental clues indicating where the remains were located between death and discovery and aspects of what happened to them.

# **METHODOLOGY**

Like other experts in forensic science, forensic anthropologists need to present objective, factual, and interpretative opinions on the evidence presented to them. Although a case may be brought to the anthropologist by a particular law enforcement group or others, it is important to retain objectivity and focus on the scientific issues concerning the evidence presented.

The forensic anthropologist also must be flexible and thoughtful in the selection of procedures and methodology. Many techniques are available to assist analysis, but proper selection of those employed must be dictated by the particular problem presented and the individual circumstances. Reports must be accurate and carefully worded since they become legal documents examined by many individuals involved with the case. Fundamental rules of documentation and chain of evidence must be followed.

# **NEW TECHNIQUES**

Recent years have witnessed accelerated research in forensic anthropology resulting in many new techniques to support all areas of analysis. These are too numerous and complex to be discussed in detail here, but the following represent a few highlights.

Recovery efforts continue to rely primarily on careful archeological-type techniques with extensive documentation. These efforts are supported by the use of aerial photography, surface topography study, ground penetrating radar, cadaver dogs (dogs trained to detect the odor of decomposing human tissue), and other technological advances.

The differentiation of human tissue from other materials continues to rely extensively upon macroscopic morphological indicators, but in fragmentary and other difficult cases these techniques can be supplemented with microscopic histological examination and/or elemental analysis using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with associated energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). SEM/EDS analysis allows bones and teeth to be distinguished from most other materials. Microscopic analysis of histological structure (Mulhern & Ubelaker, 2001) allows human bone to be distinguished from some other animals.

New techniques in the estimation of age at death, sex, and stature have become available for more parts of the skeleton and with a greater appreciation for the population variation involved.

In 1984, the physical anthropology section of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences initiated a data bank managed at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. This data bank maintains measurements and observations on identified forensic cases and documented museum collections which has been used to generate new methodology for analysis. Since these data were largely derived from forensic cases, they are of obvious utility in developing new methods to use in individual cases. New methodology stemming from this effort includes the computer program FORDISC 2.0 (Ousley & Jantz, 1996), a flexible interactive system which enables available measurements from a forensic case to be used to generate estimates of sex, ancestry, and stature.

Interpretations of time since death, trauma, and postmortem indicators (usually referred to as taphonomy in the forensic literature) have been augmented by several recent volumes on these subjects which document the complexity of the issues involved.

# **APPLICATIONS**

Most forensic anthropologists routinely work on individual cases presented to them by law enforcement, forensic pathologists, or other parties. The military employs a group of anthropologists to assist with the recovery and identification effort of decedents associated with military operations, especially those in southeast Asia. Anthropologists also have become increasingly involved in the investigations of mass disasters and suspected international human rights violations.

In 1996 Diplomates of the American Board of Forensic Anthropology reported that they had worked on 1,439 individual cases that year. Of these, 81% had been presented to them by such agencies as local law enforcement, state police, military, coroners, medical examiners, or sheriffs' departments. The remaining 19% represented civil cases; the majority of these were requested by the plaintiff. Of the agency submissions, most originated from medical examiners' or coroners' offices with the military representing an additional major contributor. Also in that year, Diplomates most commonly reported on skeletons, but also on decomposed and relatively fresh remains (Ubelaker, 2000f).

# **INTERFACE WITH RELATED DISCIPLINES**

Forensic anthropologists work closely with law enforcement, legal specialists, and a variety of scientific disciplines. Within forensic science the interface is strongest with forensic pathology and forensic odontology. Forensic pathologists conduct autopsies on relatively complete remains and usually are responsible for the overall interpretation relative to cause and manner and death. Forensic anthropologists contribute to that effort and frequently directly interact with the pathologists and related specialists at autopsy or other examination. Information provided by the forensic anthropologist can be integrated into the overall report issued by the forensic pathologist.

Forensic anthropologists also have expert knowledge about the anatomy, development, and variation of teeth and thus interface with forensic odontologists. Although there is some overlap of interest in regard to dental anatomical issues, forensic anthropologists usually defer to odontologists on issues of treatment of disease, especially restorations and related therapeutic efforts.

Particular issues in individual cases can lead anthropologists to interact with radiologists, surgeons, entomologists, botanists, geologists, zoologists, and many other experts. The nature of this interaction is dictated by the problem under investigation and the experience of those involved.

The following fictitious example illustrates applications of forensic anthropology.

Carl and Myrtle Brown were resting on the front porch of their rural home when they noticed their family hound coming into the yard with something in his mouth. They were used to this, since Fido usually came home with a bone or something similar to gnaw on beneath the porch. However, this was different, the bone looked like part of a human skull. After taking the bone inside and examining it, they decided to call the sheriff's office. A sheriff's deputy responded, took custody of the bone, and called the local medical examiner's office.

When the report came in that a suspected human bone had been found, officials at the medical examiners' office called their consulting forensic anthropologist, a professor certified by the American Board of Forensic Anthropology who taught at a nearby university. Examination by the forensic anthropologist revealed that it was in fact of human origin, of adult age, and likely of relatively recent origin since some odor and traces of soft tissue were still present.

Armed with this information, the anthropologist and the other investigators returned to the scene to try to find additional remains. The owners had no idea where the dog had been that day and a preliminary search of the premises was unsuccessful. A decision was then made to bring in a "cadaver dog," a dog specially trained to detect the odor of decomposing human tissue. After making several circles around the house, the dog indicated to his trainer that he detected the appropriate odor in some brush 200 yards from the house. Investigation revealed that most of the remainder of the skeleton was there on

the ground surface, along with some clothing. Careful recovery documented the location of the remains and all seemingly important factors.

Back in the laboratory, the authorities carefully separated the remains from the clothing and other materials. The anthropologists cleaned the remains and began the analysis. A careful inventory revealed that most of the bones were present, except for a few small bones that likely had been carried away by the dog to another location. Some additional bones were found that did not appear to the anthropologist to be human. Consultation with a zooarcheologist at the university suggested they represented small rodent and were not related directly to the human remains.

Examination of the pelvis revealed a wide sciatic notch, broad sub-pubic angle, and many other features suggesting female sex. The bones also were small and gracile as occurs in many females.

The bones were of adult size, all long bone epiphyses were united, and all teeth fully formed, suggesting the remains were older than the teenage years. Examination of the vertebrae revealed extensive arthritic change, also apparent on some of the long bone joints. Examination of the extent of cranial suture closure, dental changes, appearance of the pubic symphysis area of the pelvis, and sternal ends of the ribs also suggested advanced age. All the age indicators collectively suggested an advanced age likely between 65 and 85 years.

Features of the face, especially its relatively pointed nature, receding cheekbones, prominent chin, narrow nasal aperture, narrow interorbital distance, and the sharply defined border of the inferior nasal margin suggested a likely European ancestry. As a second approach to this problem, the anthropologists decided to take cranial measurements and analyze them using FORDISC 2.0. This test also strongly suggested a likely European ancestry.

To calculate the stature of the individual, the anthropologist measured the maximum length of the femur and then selected the appropriate published regression equation. The stature was estimated to be about 5 ft. 4 in. tall. plus or minus about  $3.7 \text{ cm}$ .

There were many suspicious alterations on the remains. Careful examination using a dissecting microscope revealed that some of these alterations were developmental anomalies that had been with her throughout her life. Others originated from trauma in the nasal area sustained by her many years before death. Additional

alterations were postmortem in origin, changes caused by sun exposure and the chewing by rodents and the dog.

Still other alterations in the skull represented perimortem trauma, sustained at or about the time of death. A roughly circular perforation was present on the left parietal with internal beveling suggesting it represented an entrance gunshot injury. A similar but larger perforation with external beveling was present on the right parietal suggesting it represented an exit gunshot injury.

All available missing persons reports for the area were examined using the profile of an elderly woman of European ancestry approximately 5 ft 4 in. tall, but no one matched the profile. Accordingly, authorities requested a facial reproduction be prepared. The anthropologist and an artist worked closely together to choose the appropriate soft tissue depth markers, place them appropriately on the cranium, and rebuild the features of the face. The resulting estimate of what the woman looked like was released to the media for publication. Subsequently a reader of the newspaper in a nearby city thought that the image was similar to an elderly woman he knew whom he had not seen in over six months and he reported this information to the police. Their investigation led to the woman's family and DNA samples that were used to make a positive identification. She was 72 years old, 5 ft  $4\frac{1}{2}$  in. tall, of European ancestry, and had suffered a broken nose five years before she disappeared.

#### SUMMARY

Forensic anthropology has evolved into an important subfield of physical anthropology and forensic science (Ubelaker, 1996). Forensic anthropologists routinely contribute to casework involving human remains and through research and experience have increased their collective ability to learn a great deal about an individual from their remains.
