## **LOCATION AND LINGUISTIC AFFILIATION**

The Highland Maya of Mexico are located in the central highland region of Chiapas, the southernmost state in Mexico. The two largest groups in the Highlands include the Tzeltal and the Tzotzil (see linguistics). These groups are closely related both culturally and linguistically. Beginning in the 1970s some Highland Maya began to emigrate into the lower elevation Selva Lacandon region of Chiapas, to other parts of Mexico, and to the United States. This migration has been largely due to economic reasons and land shortages but is also often related to religious conflict between the traditionalist catholic religious hierarchies, newly converted evangelical Protestants, and modern Catholics. Other Maya groups in Chiapas are the Chol in the northern mountains of Chiapas; Tojolobal in eastern Chiapas; the Zoque in western Chiapas and the Lacandon in the Selva Lacandon rainforest on the eastern Guatemalan border. In addition, there are approximately 25 other Maya socio-linguistic groups living in Guatemala, Belize, and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico.

The Maya language family is comprised of approximately 25 distinct languages distributed throughout southern Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. Five of these languages represent the principal linguistic groups of the family presently found in Chiapas—Tzeltal, Tzotzil, Tojolabal, Chol, and Lacandón. Three Maya languages originally spoken in Chiapas are extinct or close to extinction—Coxoh, Chicomuceltec, Mocho, and Motozintlec (see Figure 1, after INEGI, 2001). Speakers of several other Maya languages Kanjobal ≈ 6,000 speakers, Mam ≈ 5,500 speakers, Chuj 1,500 speakers, Jacaltec and Cakchiquel ≈ 500 each, Maya ≈ 100, Chontal and Kekchi 100 each) several of these represent recent migrants from Guatemala.

Of the native Chiapas Maya groups, Lacandón (with perhaps fewer than 900 speakers) is linguistically most distinct, sharing close affinities with the Yucatecan branch of the family (Yucatec, Mopán, and Itzá). Chol (≈ 141,000 speakers), is the next most distinct, followed by Tojolabal (roughly 38,000 speakers). Tzeltal (≈ 279,000 speakers) and Tzotzil (≈ 292,000 speakers) are the most closely related of the group, having separated as little as 800–1200 years ago. These two languages are spoken throughout the Central Highlands region (Mexican national census data, INEGI 2001).

Since the early 1950s, speakers of each of the four larger Maya groups have migrated in large numbers and are today found dispersed throughout the southeastern portion of the state.

## **OVERVIEW OF THE CULTURE**

Chiapas has been the site of some of the most intensive anthropological research in the world and there is abundant literature describing most aspects of Highland Maya

culture. With colonization the Spanish encouraged and cultivated ethnic distinctions between indigenous populations leading in large part to the diversity of dialects and municipal affiliations found today. Most Highland Maya continue to be subsistence farmers; although many have become involved in wage labor that has become available in the last two decades. Over the last several years, environmental degradation and political conflict have intensified in Chiapas, leading to political unrest and violence although there are currently negotiations taking place as part of a peace process in the region.

The Highland region was sparsely populated prior to Spanish conquest in the early 1500s. Even during the classic Maya period the Highland remained a relative backwater and there are few archaeological sites of significance in the area. Population grew at a rate of between 1–2% after contact up until the 20th century. Recent times have seen a much higher growth rate. Between 1970 and 1990 the indigenous populations of Chiapas grew at an astounding annual growth rate of 4.5%, however this rate has subsided with the rate from 1990–2000 at 2.0%. The average number of children born per woman is 3.4. The current population of Highland Maya over the age of 5 is approximately 571,000 (279,000 Tzeltal Maya and 292,000 Tzotzil Maya). Infant mortality is extremely high (9.5%) among the Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya. This is double the rate for the country of Mexico as a whole.

# **THE CONTEXT OF HEALTH: ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL FACTORS**

### **Environment**

Chiapas is one of the richest areas of biodiversity in the world with more than 9,000 species of vascular plants and more than 1,150 species of vertebrates. The Highlands of Chiapas range in elevation from 700 m to 2,900 m above sea level and as such display a wide range of habitats from broad leafed evergreen tropical forest to temperate pine oak forest.

Because of imminent extinction threats to both flora and fauna, environmental nongovernmental organizations have given the area highest priority for conservation. Recently, many relatively heavily forested regions in the proper Highlands have undergone extreme disturbance due to new settlements and clearing for traditional swidden agricultural fields. Clear-cutting for timber and charcoal has occurred widely, in spite of government regulations prohibiting such practices. The region is best viewed as a patchy mosaic of a wide variety of different vegetational succession stages. These habitats are widely utilized for procurement of medicinal plants (Stepp & Moerman, 2001).

The primary influences of the environment on health relate to geomorphology, climate, including seasonal variation, and conditions of sanitation. The broken terrain of rugged mountain slopes and valleys provides for some variation in health risks. One would predict a higher rate of heat preferring bacterial diseases in the lower climes and more cold tolerant viral conditions in the higher altitudes. The primary leveling factor in the disease risk patterns across elevational boundaries is the quantity and quality of water supplies. Although some programs have been undertaken for construction of water storage and distribution facilities, water probably still represents the most serious environmental factor in current disease patterns. Inadequate water supplies inhibit adequate hygienic practices. Contaminated water resources promote disease transmission. Sanitary waste disposal is the second greatest environmental risk factor. Sewer systems are almost non-existent in the Maya communities. Indoor plumbing for water and sewage is available normally only in some houses in the municipal centers. Latrines are sometimes but not always used in the more remote hamlets and some houses of the municipal centers.

As more and more families rely on some cash-based economic activities, and as road construction makes transport of construction supplies more feasible, house construction types tend to provide greater protection from the elements of nature. Cement block walls replace wattle and daub, or bound-board walls that are permeable or open to drafts. Corrugated tin, cardboard, or asbestos, and in some cases, cement and/or ceramic tiles are replacing thatch roofing that can harbor disease-transmitting fauna. Ventilation is better in the newer constructions that provide windows and flues for light, air circulation, and smoke release. Gas stoves are slowly replacing wood cooking fires and further reducing irritating smoke inhalation, which can be a risk factor for respiratory problems. Cement floors provide a barrier between soil based organisms and human hosts. Figure 2 compares the highland Maya, the State of Chiapas, and Mexico national death rates from gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases.

### **Diet**

The Maya peoples of Highland Chiapas have a long tradition of swidden agriculture based primarily on corn, beans, squash, and chili peppers. Small flocks of chickens provide a generous quantity of eggs. Turkeys, pigs, and cattle provide occasional meat. Some sheep are raised but these play a very minor role in indigenous diet as their primary value is the wool they produce for warm clothing and a few tourist items. Availability and consumption of these cultivated and domesticated species is complemented by a rich variety of non-domesticated or "lightly managed" species. In more recent times, the non-domesticates have predominantly been of plant origin as population pressures have virtually eliminated the large game animals (such as deer, agouti, peccary etc.) and restricted the number and distribution of smaller ones (e.g., field rodents, squirrels, rabbits, gophers, and lizards) in the region. The small edible creatures are often opportunistically captured in traps, though a few people may still "go hunting." In a few areas, streams provide fish, snails, and frogs on occasion. A few wild birds are sometimes eaten. Some people still keep nests of native bees for their honey. The rainy season provides an

#### **840 Maya of Highland Mexico**

abundance of wild mushrooms and there is growing cultivated mushroom production, primarily for market sales.

The period between last harvests, when agricultural stores are lowest is also the period of greatest consumption of non-cultivars. Subsistence agriculture is so marginal in the area that it is not terribly uncommon in bad years for some families to run short on beans or corn and be forced either to eat some of their seed stock or find a means of supplementing supplies through market purchase or exchange.

As in all such contexts of marginal resources, it is the children who are most affected. Chronic childhood nutritional stress is evident in the generally short stature of the population. Those families who are most well-off economically follow the universal pattern of short stature and overweight for first generation adults. Continued economic and dietary stability results in a second generation of (sometimes dramatically) increased stature.

There is also potentially a hidden danger in the change of lifestyles that frequently accompanies economic success. These typically include a shift from traditional food, especially wild species to foods of higher "prestige" such as beverages and snack foods with high sugar, salt, and/or fat content that are low in nutrients. Fortunately the classic shift from breast to bottle, with all the attendant health consequences, has not become a major problem for the highland Maya.

When peoples whose dietary problem has normally been getting enough to eat achieve food sufficiency and the potential for excess, the concept of restriction or balance is not operative. The usual pattern elsewhere is a trend toward obesity and an increased prevalence of diabetes. Such dietary consumption and nutritional health changes may be beginning to occur in the Highland Maya. People frequently report *asukcar* ( Spanish azucar "sugar") as a diagnosis. That there is no Maya term for diabetes (although they do recognize such signs as ants being drawn to urine) suggests that it is a relatively new problem. Based on the number of informal reports of the disease, a systematic study and potential early intervention program would be appropriate.

The weedy species (listed in Appendix 1) that contribute to traditional Maya diet provide high quality nutritional supplements, especially when agricultural resources are lowest. They appear to be the primary sources for vitamin A and thiamine and to add an important amount of calcium to the diet. Vitamin A deficiency is a major problem in many third world populations. It has not been reported as a problem for this group, although the association of vitamin A deficiency with increased susceptibility to diarrhea could potentially play a role in the high rates of diarrheal disease in this population. An early symptom of vitamin A deficiency is poor night vision. There appears to be no term in Maya for such a condition.

Iodine deficiency, represented by goiter and possibly dwarfism, is often reported in populations inhabiting mountainous regions, including Maya populations of Highland Guatemala. For reasons that are not as yet clear, this does not seem to represent a major health problem in the Highlands of Chiapas. Discovering the sources of this positive deviance in health pattern could possibly provide a model for other highland peoples.

Recent research (Luber, 1999) suggests that protein calorie nutrition is identified by a native term, *cha'lam tsots* "second layer of hair" and studies have shown that this is a significant health problem in the highland region (Berlin & Berlin, 1996). In a diet based on corn and beans, it is frequently difficult for small children to consume sufficient amounts to meet total nutritional needs. Simple addition of a fat source is usually sufficient to compensate for this. For both children and adults food quantity is currently more of a problem than the nutritional quality of the foods themselves. This has the

potential to change for the worse as life-styles change and especially if diet shifts toward higher prestige, nutrient poor foods.

## **Disease**<sup>1</sup>

As seen in Figure 3, gastrointestinal diseases are the greatest cause of both morbidity and mortality. The high frequency of gastroenteric conditions in both the ethnoepidemiological and epidemiological data is a reflection of the virtual universal parasitism and frequent diarrheal episodes typical of populations living in the socio-economic conditions characteristic of these communities.

Respiratory infections are the second most frequent cause of illness. Respiratory problems are surely related to the altitude (on average 2,000 m), to cold weather and traditional house construction which affords little protection from cold wind, as well as the smoke of cooking fires. Respiratory problems represent the fourth most frequent reported cause of death. This would suggest that many of these illness are more minor colds and coughs with low mortality.

Fever or, to use a bio-medical gloss "fever of unknown origin", is mentioned as the third most frequent

**Figure 3.** Rates for Morbidity and Mortality Reports in Maya Communities.

illness but the second ranked cause of death. Headaches and general aches and pains (glossed here as "arthralgias and myalgias") are the fourth and fifth most frequently reported health problems. People relatively seldom mention dermatological inflammations and infections (ranked sixth) as a cause of sickness. The lack of access to water and generally poor hygienic conditions promote high rates of dermatological problems, as evidenced by the variety of named dermatological conditions, probably making them so common as to not merit mention.

Personalistic health problems (ranked seventh in morbidity etiology) cross-cut many categories of disease. Despite the rather low frequency of report of so-called "personalistic" conditions in the morbidity files (ranking seventh as a cause of morbidity), conditions with an attributed personalistic etiology tie with respiratory disease as third and fourth causes of death. This supports the pattern, one that holds across many cultures, that most health conditions are considered at least initially to be naturalistic in nature and those that are more life threatening or more resistant to treatment may become re-diagnosed as personalistic. Further analysis of the conditions reported in association with personalistic deaths shows that more than half of the personalistic deaths were preceded by gastrointestinal symptoms and about 25% were associated with edema. This pattern of reported high fatality from gastrointestinal disease and edema of personalistic etiology form a significant cluster that merits further evaluation. Culturally, it reaffirms the attribution of personalistic etiology to serious illness. It also demonstrates a culturally defined link that also makes sense from a scientific physiological perspective.

The data for sex adjusted death rates due to accident or violence (which is the eighth most frequent cause of morbidity) show about 85% of males and 39% of women were attributed to homicide. A large proportion of both statistics were likely due to violence initiated by males and probably while drinking.

Eye problems in most municipalities consist of standard conjunctivitis and infections. However, in a few areas, particularly the municipality of Oxchuc, trachoma is a serious health problem that can lead to blindness if untreated. A diagnosis of mental illness may encompass advanced cysticercosis affecting the brain and this may account for the relatively high ranking of mental illness (Castille, 1996).

General "women's problems" are not often reported as a cause of morbidity. Death associated primarily with obstetric problems occurs at much higher frequency than is reported for morbidity. This is an artifact of the absence of reports of uncomplicated live births in a population with a very high birth rate. It also quite possibly reflects the fact that mortality is high when complications do occur and women might be more remiss to mention more minor problems of this nature. Death precipitated by accidents or violence is reported at about equal frequency with deaths related to obstetric/gynecological problems. The precipitating events for both either occur at very low frequency but carry high fatality or are relatively unremarkable when death is not the outcome.

The general distribution of reported health problems by age group, shows that more cases are reported in the lower age groups, with decreasing illness events with age. However, when adjusted for age, the infants and preschool aged children have a lower report of illness than most other groups, in relation to the total number represented in the sample (Figure 4).

## **MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS**

It is more accurate to define areas of medical specialization in Maya medicine and note that aspects of one or more of these specialties may be incorporated in any given healer's armamentarium of skills. These specialties include diviner/healer, one who prays to the mountains, pulse-reader, mid-wife, bone-setter, massager, and (in Yucatan) herbalist (*tsak xiu* lit. "herb grabber").

Diviner/healers incorporate the more traditional shamanic healing practices. Prayers to the mountains might best be considered as preventive medicine specialists in that they pray to the hills and in caves for the protection of the population and for the prevention of periodic and epidemic diseases (such as the classic childhood diseases). Pulse-readers are able to diagnose and monitor the progress of disease based on the detection of

![](_page_4_Figure_11.jpeg)

**Figure 4.** Proportion of population reporting illness by age group.

#### **Classification of Illness, Theories of Illness, and Treatment of Illness 843**

the type and quality of the pulse at various points on the body. The term mid-wife is somewhat misleading as the knowledge and skills of these practitioners generally is more inclusive of women's health problems and, like other medical specialists, may include various aspects of the other healing specialties. It is interesting to note that there is no specialized role with a distinct term for "herbalist" among the Maya of Highland Chiapas. Individuals with special knowledge of plants are sometime referred to with the descriptive phrase *ja' mach'a ya sna ta poxil wamale* "one who knows medicinal plants." In this region, knowledge of medicinal plants is broadly, if not equally, shared. Many people can identify a plant as medicinal and name the condition it treats, even if they have never used it and/or do not know exactly how it is prepared. Interest in medicinal plants and traditional healing has stimulated an emerging role for herbalists among the Tzeltal and Tzotzil and a widely accepted name for this role may eventually be coined.

# **CLASSIFICATION OF ILLNESS, THEORIES OF ILLNESS, AND TREATMENT OF ILLNESS**

### **General Principles**

The Maya medical system is holistic in that there is a close relationship between the health of an individual and his/her relationship with other people, various environmental factors and forces and members of the spiritual realm as well as elements of contagion. Both problems of health and their treatments can be divided into two distinct systems (following Foster, 1976);

- 1. The naturalistic system encompasses a majority of health conditions and is the diagnosis of first resort even for many conditions that are later classified as personalistic.
- 2. The personalistic system comprises a set of conditions that are intentionally or conditionally specific to the individual and/or incorporate extranatural origins.<sup>2</sup>

## **Naturalistic Health Problems**

Diagnosis of naturalistic health problems is founded on complex ethnomedical understanding of anatomy, physiology, and the symptomatology of specific health conditions. Because these conditions are symptom-based, people readily group conditions with similar symptoms together although these sickness clusters do not have standard Maya names, they can be glossed as follows: gastrointestinal conditions (alimentary paths), respiratory conditions (airways), dermatological conditions (skin), fevers, headaches, arthralgias and myalgias (general aches and pains), urinary problems (urinary paths), women's conditions, malaise (weakness and wasting), mental conditions, edemas, breaks/sprains, ophthalmic problems (eyes), buccal-dental problems (mouth), emotional conditions (emotion), bites/stings (Figure 5).

These classes, being symptom-based, relate roughly to physiological organ systems. Notably lacking for comparative purposes with biomedical medicine is the cardiovascular system. The close relationship between the heart and lungs (blood circulation and respiration) in Maya ethnophysiology and the general imprecision of cardiovascular symptoms probably accounts for this.

Any sickness that begins with a naturalistic diagnosis may eventually require reanalysis and referral to a personalistic healer. This reevaluation occurs normally when a condition is exceptional in that it does not respond to normal treatment (often with herbal remedies), or alternatively, if symptoms become very severe or life-threatening.

Causes of illness and disease in the naturalistic system range from the mundane life events to more existential reasons. Consumption of spoiled, contaminated, or inappropriate (e.g., causing humoral imbalance) foods and beverages, and prolonged hunger are particular sources of alimentary tract problems. Hard work can

**Figure 5.** General Classes of Naturalistic Health Problems for Highland Maya.

cause health problems. In addition to breaks and sprains, falls can cause organs to dislodge and malfunction. Sorrow, embarrassment, and anger can all trigger physical illness as can environmental conditions such as rain, cold, heat, and contact with (being struck by or stepping on the landing site of) St. Elmo's fire.<sup>3</sup> Airs and wind are a prominent source of illness, especially among the Maya of Yucatan. These may be literal breezes or metaphorical winds that harbor substances that enter the body and cause disease. Airs and winds can also cause humoral imbalances in the body, as can many other substances and phenomena.

Treatment of naturalistic health problems is founded on a complex ethnopharmacoepia of primarily plantbased natural products. Appendix 2 lists the plant species most commonly used by the Highland Maya of Mexico for each major set of health conditions, as well as some of their known pharmacological properties and the medicinal virtues attributed to them in Maya medicine. These plants are readily available, usually within a 1 km radius of the household, and grow along trailsides and fallow fields (Stepp, 2001). Dietary and behavioral restrictions and recommendations accompany herbal treatments. Many of these are based on humoral balance, however, other factors such as digestibility may also be considered. The most frequent behavioral recommendation is rest, either in bed or by avoiding strenuous effort. Infrequently a patient may be prohibited from going outside and being exposed to sunlight.

The majority of Maya formulary are administered orally as teas, infusions, and concoctions, however other therapeutic measures include plasters, massage, blood letting/acupuncture,<sup>4</sup> bone-setting, and heat application.

## **Personalistic Health Problems**

Personalistic health problems are directed specifically at the individual and originate from numerous sources that can be divided into the following classes: human given, God-given,<sup>5</sup> fright, problems of the soul/spirit, destiny. Human given illness include those that are intentionally caused (witchcraft), and those that are unintentional (e.g. evil/strong eye). Problems of the soul or spirit include soul loss and effects to one's animal companion soul. Deities (such as the Spiritual Ancestors, Sacred Father Sun, Sacred Mother Moon, Earth Lord, Thunderbolt, Mother Wind) control numerous aspects of life and can punish evil-doers as well as become irritated or angry

and cause illness. Destiny (primarily determined by date and time of birth) is more significant in Guatemala as a health determinant than in Mexico. For serious believers, a considerable amount of time may be spent in maintaining good relations with the various deities. This is, in many respects, preventive medicine.

Diagnosis of personalistic conditions is made on the basis of divination and pulsing. Such diagnosis requires intervention of a specialist healer who first of all diagnoses the true cause (ultimate cause) of illness. Appropriate interventions can then be undertaken on behalf of the patient. These interventions include prayers and incantations on behalf of the patient, including the sacrifice (such as a black chicken in substitution for the patient's soul). Calling the soul's return, sweeping disease from the body with herbs, blowing liquids over the patient to dispel agents of disease and the offering of incense, candles, and liquor to the spiritual ancestor or deity in supplication, atonement, or appeasement. Natural medicines may also be administered at this time, but the primary intervention is non-secular.

Until very recently the concepts and methods for scientifically evaluating personalistic healing were lacking. As yet, few studies have been undertaken to elucidate the psycho-neuro-physiological processes involved in effecting healing through such practices. Recent developments in biomolecular medicine verify that personalistic healing can effect cures, precisely in those cases that are most resistant biomedical treatment, just as our traditional practitioner colleagues have previously informed us.

## **SEXUALITY AND REPRODUCTION**

Pregnancy is said to be the result of the combination of the sexual fluids (strength) of both male and female. Sex of the child is said by some to be determined by the father because a woman produces only female substances but a man may produce male and female substances. Others say that the child's sex is determined by whether the substance of the man or the woman is strongest at the time of conception. Certain plants that can be used to ensure the birth of a male or female. All of these notions seem to conflict with the practice of the mid-wife to count the veins and arteries in the umbilical cord to determine the number of children that a woman will have and, by some reports, the darker vessels signify a male child and the lighter indicate a female child.

## **HEALTH THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE**

### **Pregnancy and Birth**

Most children are born at home with the aid of a mid-wife. The birth attendant may administer plant and/or animal derived natural medicines as birth aids. Where the traditional steam bath is still in use, the birth may take place inside the sweathouse and the mother and infant may remain there for a while afterward. In other areas the woman is placed over a steaming pot of water and herbs. After childbirth, a woman is given warm foods and beverages. The mid-wife may return to administer baths and massages to the new mother over a period of days post-partum.

Dietary and behavioral proscriptions and prescriptions are intended to ensure a healthy baby and a safe delivery. Many of these have strong humoral elements. Others simply ensure that the mother not jeopardize the pregnancy through risky behavior.

### **Infancy**

A new child of either sex is generally welcome, although there may be a slight preference for boys. Prayers and rituals are begun shortly after birth to make certain that the ancestral spirits and deities protect the child and a variety of preventive measures are undertaken to keep the baby's soul intact. During the first few weeks, the mother and child avoid social contacts and stay close to home to prevent illness, especially of the infant. The infant's soul is considered to be weakly attached and various precautions are taken to prevent the baby's soul from wandering, becoming lost, or returning to the cosmic pool. The infant's wrists and ankles may be tied with string or small bracelets to tether the soul. An infant may wear amulets, such as amber bracelets to prevent illness, especially from evil eye. When mother and child begin to go out, the mother must place branches or other items to across all paths crossing where her pathway to guide the baby's soul safely home.

Within a few months a baby is often be in the care of older siblings who learn from a very early age to carry a child in a shawl on their backs. Birth defects and undesirable physical and mental characteristics may result when a pregnant woman makes fun of a person or animal who has the particular characteristic. Sometimes just looking at an animal, especially a dead animal, will cause developmental problems for the child to be born. An envious woman may disrupt a pregnancy and take the

fetus into her own body. A fetus resembling a frog, or other creature (probably abortion in early stages of development) may be sent to a woman through witchcraft.

Childcare practices are reflected in the morbidity patterns for infants and toddlers. Inability of very small children to communicate symptoms dictates that health problems must be interpreted on the basis of overt signs. Figure 6 depicts the cumulative frequency of sickness reports. Fever, which may accompany any number of conditions, is the primary diagnosis in small children. The early months and years breast-fed children are relatively protected by maternal antibodies and from dietary contaminants. The number of reports of all conditions, but especially fever, peak during the third year range when children are weaned and consuming regular foods, achieve greater freedom to wander around and come into contact with ambient pathogens. Since toddlers still have limited language skills, fever remains a frequent diagnosis. By five years of age, children begin to approach the adult pattern. Mothers report fewer illnesses overall and gastrointestinal and respiratory become the most significant health problems.

### **Childhood**

Childhood is a training period for adulthood. Children are included in all aspects of life and, as their understanding and abilities grow, they gradually assume a greater role in daily household activities as well as special occasion rituals. Pre-pubescent girls are initiated into the art of tortilla making by wrapping their hands with hot tortillas to toughen them as they begin their training in this fundamental activity. Pre-pubescent boys begin accompanying their fathers in their agricultural duties. As they assume the roles of adulthood, their health risks are those of adults and these are reflected in their health patterns. Forces of change for these patterns derive from the increased numbers of children attending school for longer periods, as well as increased involvement in cash-based

![](_page_7_Figure_12.jpeg)

**Figure 6.** Relative Rates of Sickness Reports for Children 5 Years and Younger.

economic activities and a switch to pre-processed, machine-made tortillas.

### **Adolescence**

Perhaps because adolescents are inclined to high risk behavior, there is an overall higher report of illness during this period (Figure 4 above).

## **Adulthood**

While the causes of illness are similar for men and women, the causes of death vary considerably. Although mid-wives seem to have a high success rate for live births, maternal mortality is high when complications occur. Many women still know a number of herbal formulae for birth control reportedly that may effect temporary or permanent infertility, including *Diascorea floribunda*, the plant source of the primary modern contraceptive prescribed for hormonal suppression of female fertility. Biomedical health care providers and well-meaning family planning programs have discouraged the use of herbal controls. However, the Maya are joining the alternative medicine revolution and returning to their traditional medical formulations.

Death precipitated by accidents or violence is reported at about equal frequency with deaths related to obstetric/gynecological problems. Males, on the other hand, have a disproportionate mortality due to these causes. Over 85% of men's deaths due to accident or violence were attributed to homicide (39% for women). The old patterns of violence toward women are changing very slowly. It is possible that a large portion of those were due to violence initiated by (inebriated) males, which plays a tragic role in morbidity and mortality among the Highland Maya.

## **The Aged**

As can be seen in demographic data from the Highlands of Chiapas, the elderly comprise a small percentage of the population. The extended household appears to be common enough to accommodate those few who reach advanced age. It is recognized that the older generations are sources of cultural knowledge that is not being learned by many youths. When occasions arise in which this knowledge is attributed special value, the aged gain in prestige. However, many of the young aspire to the knowledge and skills of the national and international community and their appreciation of traditional knowledge tends to be lessened. Those who have reached advance age appear to suffer no greater frequency of health problems than their other adult peers.

## **Dying and Death**

Any loss of consciousness, such as fainting is viewed as a near-death experience. When illness strikes, the first recourse is to attempt self treatment, either with traditional remedies or, when cash is available, with medicines purchased at a local pharmacy, store or occasionally venders in the local markets. Serious illness or one resistant to treatment is likely to require intervention by a personalistic healer. Consultation at a clinic or hospital usually comes late in the course of sickness, if at all, primarily because of the high cost and lack of respect with which Indians are frequently treated by biomedical personnel. Persons who suffer a life-threatening illness are cared for and kept warm by family members. Precipitous death of the young and relatively healthy invites a causal attribution of personalistic intervention by deities or ill meaning humans.

The soul of the recently deceased is thought by some to linger for a while after death and to pose some risk to the living, especially family members and those whose souls are easily lost, such as children. A pregnant woman may be at risk of having the soul of the deceased enter her unborn fetus, which seems to be undesirable.

## **CHANGING HEALTH PATTERNS**

Analysis of changes over time from "traditional" to "contemporary" involves an essentially arbitrary decision concerning a starting point. Most of the texts on the Ancient Maya that would have given us detailed information on their medical system and general health were destroyed by the Catholic priests accompanying the conquering Spanish armies. Early writings describe many aspects of culture, including medical beliefs and practices and even some diseases. Since these early texts were written after Spanish contact and under the guidance of priests who themselves administered to the sick, we cannot be sure that there is no old world medical influence.

One thing that is clear from all the studies that have been undertaken to date. Many of the plants that are currently in use in Maya medicine are native to the region and have most likely been employed for centuries, if not millennia.

## **NOTES**

- 1. Data from two ethnoepidemiological surveys, conducted by E. A. Berlin in 1987–88 and J. R. Stepp in 1999–2000, form the basis of this report. These patterns generally fit the epidemiological reports from health clinics of the region.
- 2. The original proposition of Foster and Anderson limited personalistic illness to those directed specifically at an individual, however, it is clear that there are other non-natural or beyond natural etiologies that would not fit within a naturalistic classification and are therefore included here in the personalistic category.
- 3. St. Elmo's fire is the term used to refer to the atmospheric phenomena that produces ball-lightening that seems to shower on earth.
- 4. This aspect of Maya curing has been poorly studied except among the Maya of Yucatan, where García, Sierra, and Balán (1996) have made an interesting comparison between Maya and Chinese Medical systems.
- 5. In at least one municipality of the Highlands of Chiapas, this classification has come to be associated with naturalistic conditions, primarily through the influence of a local priest who has emphasized illness and disease as coming from God but more in the nature of things. This in the sense of God's will be done as opposed to particular punishment or penalty for transgression.
