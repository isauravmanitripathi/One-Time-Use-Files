# **Haitians**

### **Robert Lawless**

## **ALTERNATIVE NAMES**

The ethnonyms for Haitian include the Creole word *ayisyen* and the French word *haïtien*. In English language sources the word is also sometimes spelled *Haytian*. Haiti in Creole is *Ayiti*; and in French, *Haïti*.

## **LOCATION AND LINGUISTIC AFFILIATION**

Occupying the western third of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, which it shares with the Dominican Republic, Haiti covers 27,750 km2 and is located 90 km southeast of Cuba, 187 km northeast of Jamaica, and about 1,000 km from Florida. Although Haiti has some flat, semiarid valleys, much of the country consists of rugged and sharply dissected mountains with about two thirds of the almost 28,000 km<sup>2</sup> divided into three mountain ranges. La Selle Peak, the highest elevation, tops off at about 2,680 m. The average temperature falls within a typical Caribbean range with the capital city of Port-au-Prince having a mean annual temperature of 26.3 Celsius.

Although difficult and chronically misunderstood, the language situation is not complex. All Haitians speak Creole, sometimes referred to as Haitian Creole. For most of modern history, however, the official language of government, business, and education has been French, though only about 3% of the population speaks French with any recognizable fluency. Traditionally the educated elites have used the requirement of French to exclude the masses from competing for positions in government and business. Creole has, nevertheless, come into its own in recent years and is gaining prestige as the natural tongue of Haitians and of Haiti. The current constitution states, "All Haitians are united through one common language: Creole. Creole and French are the official language of the Republic." Due to the recent flood of Haitian migrants to Florida, the international decline of the French language, and various economic and cultural trends in the Caribbean, there has been a considerable expansion in the use of English.

# **OVERVIEW OF THE CULTURE**

### **Demography**

Although demographic information is highly undependable, an estimation of the total population would be 8,500,000 million, and the capital of Port-au-Prince would

#### **Overview of the Culture 697**

be estimated at 1,500,000 million people. In addition, Haiti has a tradition of emigration, and many Haitians live in the neighboring Dominican Republic, on other Caribbean islands, in the countries of Central America, northern South America, and in North America, especially New York City, which hosts the second largest Haitian community after Port-au-Prince.

### **History**

The Republic of Haiti is the second oldest independent nation in the Western Hemisphere, and it is the only one with an overwhelmingly African culture. The people who occupied the island of Hispaniola at the beginning of the 16th century when Europeans first arrived in significant numbers rapidly succumbed to imported diseases, died in battle, or were killed off by slavery in the first 50 years of Spanish occupation. The Europeans then brought slaves from Africa.

These slaves primarily worked the sugar cane plantations that made the French colony of Saint Domingue an economic success. This success, however, was based on unimaginable brutality and cruelty, and in 1789 the slaves began their 5-year struggle for freedom. On January 1, 1804, the ex-slaves of Saint Domingue renamed their country Haiti and proclaimed its independence.

From 1915 until 1934 the United States occupied Haiti and suppressed peasant movements, revamped the army, and concentrated sociopolitical power in Portau-Prince. Until 1946 the Haitian administrations were pale reflections of U.S. political interests in the Caribbean. Then from 1946 to 1950 President Dumarsais Estimé ushered in a progressive era that saw an interest in African heritage, cooperation with other Caribbean nations, the development of peasant economic cooperation, the introduction of progressive income tax, expanded education and economic opportunities for the poor, and the rise of a middle class.

In 1957 President François Duvalier emerged as the proclaimed heir to Estimé. The Duvalier regime was marked by brutal oppression against opponents and isolation from the international community. Many professionals fled into exile, and the economy descended into a serious slump. With the 1971 transition from Duvalier to his 19-year-old son Jean-Claude, the United States guided Haiti to a new economic program that featured private investments from the United States featuring no custom taxes, a very low minimum wage, the suppression of labor unions, and the right of U.S. companies to repatriate their profits. For most of the population living conditions continued to decline.

With little to show after 14 years of rule by a second Duvalier, Haitians began protest demonstrations in 1984. In February 1986 Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to France, and an era ended. After several provisional governments the popular priest Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected president and installed in office in February 1991—5 years to the day after the end of the Duvalier dynasty.

Despite the widespread popularity of Aristide and the heightened expectations of the masses, the military ousted Aristide after only 7 months. No government or state except the Vatican recognized the de facto military regime. This brutal and illegal 3-year occupation of Haiti by its own army saw a rapid downward spiral in the economic and health conditions of Haitians.

Under U.S. sponsorship Aristide was returned to power in October 1994. Since Aristide could not succeed himself, his protege René Préval was elected and took office in February 1996. Four years later Aristide was again elected president and took office in February 2001.

### **Economy and Occupations**

After defeating the colonial government of the French slave owners the newly independent nation faced the threat of a French army returning to re-enslave them. To counter this perceived threat, the new government at first confiscated private land and imposed forced labor in an attempt to develop an export agriculture leading to the importation of war material. Such a plan proved impractical, and eventually the confiscated plantations were distributed to the ex-slaves and the Haitian elite retreated to the provincial cities. The result was the fragmentation of land holdings, peasantization, and the alienation of the masses from the government and the ruling elites. Currently an estimated 80% of the rural population owns its own land, though the plots are fragmented and small, and about 65% of the labor force is in agriculture. Despite the importance of agriculture and the peasantization of Haiti, the government traditionally expends little effort or money on agricultural research or on integrating the rural population into the politics of the country.

Haiti's primary export products have traditionally been coffee, sugar, rice, and cocoa, though the political uncertainties of recent decades have meant a low rate of export. Haiti has some light manufacturing along with a few cotton mills. Before the so-called de facto regime, when offshore industries were in operation, Haiti was a major source of garments, toys, baseballs, and electronic goods for the United States. Many people engage in the manufacture of tools and small items.

Market women from the rural areas bargain their produce in open-air markets, and most of this produce moves by foot as these women often carry heavy loads. All sorts of merchandise may be found in the city markets, including black-market items. Much of the trading is done in kind. The annual per capita monetary income is estimated at only US\$480.

## **Social and Political Conditions**

The early distribution of land to the rural population created a large class of peasants who generally regard the government as a nuisance. Haiti does, nevertheless, have a political structure. The nation is traditionally divided into several *départements*, each of which is further divided in several *arrondissements*, and each *arrondissement* consists of several *communes* that usually coincide with church parishes. Finally, each *commune* is divided into several *sections rurales*, each of which is headed by an appointed *chef de section*, who reports to the *commandant* of the *commune*, who reports to the *préfet* of the *arrondissement*. The government official that rural Haitians deal with is generally the *chef de section*. In urban areas the most important government official is usually the *préfet*. For the most part, however, the rural population polices itself under the watchful eyes of village elders. A rather subfunctional police force and a largely corrupt court system exist in the urban areas.

### **International Relations**

Internationally Haiti is closely tied to the United States with a sizeable majority of its exports coming to North America and a goodly portion of its economy dependent on government and nongovernment aid from the United States. Although twice-elected Aristide remains popular among Haitians, his socialistic and anti-American rhetoric means that influential sectors in the U.S. government will continue to oppose his administration.

Since May 2000 when the party of President Aristide won approximately 80% of the seats in a parliamentary election and the U.S.-backed opposition front Democratic Convergence alleged that the election was rigged, Haiti has been in a political and economic crisis. Largely under pressure from the United States, more than US\$500 million in international aid has been frozen until the government and the opposition reach an agreement to hold new elections.

## **Family and Kinship**

The family and kinship pattern most prevalent in rural Haiti is the somewhat patrilineal extended family and patrilocality resulting in a cluster of consanguineously and affinely linked joint households headed by the oldest male member. Traditionally the rural population has tended to avoid involvement both with the Roman Catholic church and with the government, which means that this population also avoids legal and church marriages. The result is a wide variety of mating and parenting patterns, including completely informal unions, non-conjugal couples, fathers who do not participate in rearing their children, and non-nuclear family households, as well as conventional church weddings, longterm monogamous unions, and neolocal nuclear family households. Also, both men and women may simultaneously, or in succession, enter several different kinds of union with the same or with different partners. Since all children from all the varieties of conjugal unions have equal rights of inheritance, the complexities of the domestic unit often lead to significant inheritance problems. In addition, the specification of the adult responsible for the care and health of a child can be easily disputed.

### **Religion**

All religions have a close connection with health and illness, and an understanding of the religions of Haitians is essential for developing an appreciation of their health care system. Although some of the population is nominally Christian, the major religion of Haiti is Voodoo. Between 50 and 75% of the population of rural Haiti actively practice Voodoo, and 90% believe in it to some degree. Voodoo is also very popular among the urban working class, and to some degree among people in all classes, including the educated elite. Many important ceremonies revolve around celebrations of milestones in the life cycle, such as birth, maturity, marriage, and death. Other important ceremonies focus on agriculture, planting, harvesting, and insuring a sufficient crop yield. An ancient, affirmative, and legitimate religion that focuses

#### **The Context of Health 699**

on contacting and appeasing ancestral spirits, Voodoo provides a folk medical system that attributes illnesses to angry ancestors. The performance of ceremonies that appropriately appease these ancestors is, then, extremely important in curing illness. Such ceremonies include divination rites, used to find the cause of illnesses; healing rites, used to interact directly with sick people; propitiatory rites, used for offerings to specific spirits; and preventive rites, used to offer sacrifices to prevent trouble.

# **THE CONTEXT OF HEALTH: ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL FACTORS**

### **Demography**

According to various studies, the birth rate is probably around 35.5 per 100,000, and the annual growth rate somewhere just less than 2% per annum; the mortality per 1,000 is approximately 13; the infant mortality per 1,000 is estimated to be about 140; and life expectancy at birth is about 54 years.

### **Colonial Era**

No reliable information exists on the conditions for slaves during the colonial era. The treatment of the slaves was most certainly deplorable, and their diet was no doubt substandard. Various estimates suggest that the life expectancy of slaves after their arrival in Saint Domingue was 7 years. As inhuman as it sounds, the economies of slavery dictated that it was cheaper to export labor and quite literally work the slaves to death rather than waste time and energy on reproducing and maintaining a domestic work force.

### **Postcolonial Era**

Currently tuberculosis is Haiti's most serious disease. The country is also infected with malaria, influenza, dysentery, tetanus, whooping cough, and measles. Eye problems are endemic, and blindness is not uncommon and is usually caused by cataracts, scarring of the cornea, and glaucoma.

Many Haitians, especially the poorer masses, suffer many health problems associated with malnutrition. The daily per capita food consumption is estimated at 1600 calories, and measles, diarrhea, and tetanus claim the lives of many children before they reach 10 years of age.

A 92-page study released in 1992 by the Permanent Commission on Emergency Aid, which represents more than 60 non-governmental development and democracy organizations in Haiti, reported that the death rate has been rising and the health of the population dropping since the 1991 military takeover. Pointing out that there has been a deterioration in state services amounting to a descent into chaos, the report stated, "The situation is extremely critical and just waiting for cholera to strike" (Staff, 1992). Other problems that were reported included an increase in garbage in the streets, a rise in the number of preventable illnesses, and a deterioration in mental health. This report is the most recent one covering a general overview of health in Haiti. There is every reason to believe that the situation has deteriorated further as Haiti enters the 21st century. The most recent estimate, for example, is that only 40% of the population has easy access to potable water (Farmer, 2002).

### **Current Era**

An obvious current difficulty is the U.S.-sponsored embargo. In an electronic message sent in March 2002 to the Haitian Discussion Group the anthropologist and physician Paul Farmer spells out the health problems resulting from this embargo (Farmer, 2002). Farmer's 80 bed charity hospital has delivered health services in the central plateau for the last 18 years, and he writes that the situation there has gravely deteriorated because of a serious lack of resources, medical personnel, and an increase in diseases. He draws a direct connection between this suffering and the aid embargo.

Farmer points out that while the brutality of the 1991–1994 de facto military regime is well known with thousands killed outright and hundreds of thousands made homeless, the current catastrophic decline in overall health is much less publicized. There have been measles epidemics, outbreaks of dengue fever and polio, as well as the appearance of other vaccine-preventable diseases. Most of these diseases are related to the increasing prevalence of malnutrition. According to Farmer, "The nationwide network of public clinics and hospitals was left to fend for itself, and many health professionals left Haiti as this network foundered" (2002).

Although democratic rule was restored in 1994, and a coalition of international donors promised more than \$500 million of aid, no monies have yet been disbursed. During 2001 the United States declared a formal aid embargo that blocks all loans and grants from the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. As a result 40,000 or so inhabitants of the commune where Farmer's hospital is located (Thomonde in the Departement du Centre) are without a single doctor or nurse, except for Farmer's hospital, which is now overwhelmed with patients. In the nation at large there is only one physician for every 11,000 patients.

### **Health Infrastructure**

Although Western medicine has been available to the urban elite for several decades and is, indeed, available from a few rural clinics, Voodoo healers are a major part of the medical system of Haiti. Interestingly Haitians place an enormous emphasis on physical cleanliness. It is very important to be clean-looking and clean-smelling in your body, your clothing, and your home. This value may be important in helping Haitians to accept modern medical practices. Bathing is explicitly health-oriented. According to Haitian folk model, regular morning baths are necessary to maintain the balance of the body. Irregular bathing causes heating up of the body and may result in stomach boils. Incidentally bathing, which is often done in a nearby river, is usually done with the clothes on, and it is thought that keeping the clothes on helps cool the body and prevents loose bowels. For the most part, however, health and healing for most Haitians are handled by herbal medicine, bonesetters, injectionists, Voodoo rituals, and by a rich body of folk knowledge.

## **MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS**

Voodoo is a particularly egalitarian religion with both men and women serving as intermediaries, and this rule follows for most of the indigenous therapists. There are at least four types of indigenous therapists who can treat illnesses caused by natural phenomena and two who treat illnesses caused by unnatural phenomena: (1) herbalists, (2) bonesetters, (3) injectionists, (4) midwives, (5) Voodoo priests and priestesses, and (6) sorcerers.

(1) Among the most common therapists are herbalists (leaf doctors, or in Creole *dòktè fèy* or *medsin fèy*). As with the other indigenous therapists, herbalists have no manuals or organized schools for training. They can be either men or women, and they treat natural illnesses through administering teas and with the use of various baths and compresses, which are usually accompanied by incantations and rituals. They seem to come in families, and every village has several people who specialize in herbal treatments, most of whom work only part-time as herbalists. Many herbalists are also Voodoo priests and priestesses. The herbalists may also use injections and pharmaceutical preparations.

- (2) Bonesetters (*dòktè zo* or *medsin zo*) are not very numerous, and frequently those in rural areas with broken bones may have to hike for several hours to the home of a bonesetter. The bonesetters are generally recruited through spiritual revelation and serve a fairly long apprenticeship. They realign broken bones and fix obstructed blood vessels. Most use a flour-based plaster cast that is applied and left on for several weeks.
- (3) Injectionists (*pikirist*) usually learn their trade through affiliation with a medical center and are usually found in urban areas. They often are patronized by tuberculosis patients, and they administer the daily streptomycin in the patient's home. Although some injectionists use pharmaceutical preparations, they may also be found in the streets pushing carts holding jars of medicine that often contain only cough syrup. The injectionists diagnose the patient's illness on the spot and select a syrup to inject, which they may do with a previously used syringe. Due to the obvious implications for the spread of disease, especially AIDS, some of the several recent administrations have cracked down on these itinerant injectionists, and nowadays few are found roaming the streets.
- (4) Midwives (*fanmsay*) are always women, and it is estimated that they deliver at least 85% of all babies born in Haiti. Some learn their trade from an apprenticeship and others from their mothers, though some have in the past been trained and paid by the state. They all use herbal treatments for all neonatal complaints, and they sometimes consult with herbalists.

The most typically Haitian medical practitioners are the Voodoo priests (*ougan*), priestesses (*manbo*), and sorcerers (*boko*). Their role will be treated in more detail at the end of the next section.

# **CLASSIFICATION OF ILLNESS, THEORIES OF ILLNESS, AND TREATMENT OF ILLNESS**

The traditional healing system of Haiti is complex, but it can profitably be discussed in terms of (1) humoral systems, (2) the concept of personhood, (3) the anatomy of the body, (4) the etiology of disease, and (5) mechanisms of diagnosis.

(1) Haitian concepts of health incorporate the familiar hot-cold dichotomies imported from ancient Europe and used throughout Latin America. Haitian concepts may also incorporate

#### **Sexuality and Reproduction 701**

humoral-related ideas from West Africa, but little information exists on related African indigenous health systems, which themselves may have been influenced by Islamic sources. In its simplest form humoral systems depend on controlling health through the monitoring of intakes of hot and cold items, primarily food.

Good health requires people to maintain their individual balance of the four humors. Sickness results from a humoral imbalance and from extremes of hot and cold, dry and wet. One's humoral equilibrium can be influenced by age, climate, style of living, and the seasons, and especially by one's diet.

Over the generations in Latin America the humoral system of the Spaniards was altered and simplified with the wet and dry categories disappearing. Although not well studied, the humoral system is widespread in Haiti, and "is a guiding principle in rural Haitian behavior" (Wiese, 1976, p. 198). Interestingly H.J.C. Wiese lists Haitian foods' hot and cold ratings and gives the vitamin and mineral content of Haitian food (Wiese, 1976, pp. 196–197).

P. Minn supplies a recent account of an illness rooted in humoral pathology that is called simply heat (*chalè*) (Minn, 2001). When Haitians say, "*M gen chalè*" (I have heat), they mean that they have been exposed to excessive amounts of heat and are therefore ill, with the most common symptoms being dizziness and headaches, though almost every part of the body, especially the skin, can be affected in various ways.

- (2) Religious beliefs in general and religious practices in particular involve some degree of loss of control over the natural world, and all, therefore, leave the individual vulnerable. The defense against being damaged when in a vulnerable state is the establishment of good relations with the supra-natural world. Such good relations come primarily through being possessed by entities from the supra-natural world. Such possession is easier when the person is composed of various tenuously related parts. Such a characteristic is, indeed, found in the Haitian concept of personhood. The head is, for example, seen as the seat of the good big angel and the good little angel (*gwo bon anj e ti bon anj*). The little angel is the one who goes to heaven and is the guardian of the person. The big angel feels emotion and can be displaced through possession. The usual struggle before a person is possessed, which is sometime quite violent, is the attempt of the little angel to prevent the possession. At the death of the natural person the big angel goes back to Africa (*Ginen*).
- (3) The head is also the seat of the spirits. It must be washed, fed, and, at death, the master of the head (*mèt tèt*), who controls thinking, must be removed. When people are worried, their head is "loaded." In excitement the head heats up. The medium of heating and cooling is the blood. As might be expected in a system largely based on the humoral system, a major part of both causing and curing illnesses involves manipulating heat and cold, and influencing the state of the blood, and the condition of the head. The tools of manipulation usually focus on the intake of food; food as a sacrifice to the ancestors, food as charity, food as poison, and also oral and injected medicines.
- (4) In terms of etiology illnesses have various causes, but the basic distinction is between natural and supra-natural phenomena. Natural illnesses include everything from infectious to chronic degenerative diseases and may be treated by priests

and priestesses or physicians or other types of indigenous therapists, according to varying criteria such as severity of illness, customary local practices, availability of competent practitioners, and ability to pay. Supra-natural illnesses are attributed either to sorcery or to the supra-natural spirits and can be treated only by priests and priestesses.

(5) The first step in diagnosis is to determine the complexion of the disease and the natural humoral balance of the patient. Following the principle of opposites, a disease thought to be hot will be treated with cold herbal remedies and the patient will be advised to eat mainly cold foods. A person complaining, for example, of *chalè* in the head will usually be treated with cold water and with medicinal leaves on the head. In general, treatment consists of attempts to restore the normal humoral balance. Actual methods of diagnosis and treatment vary from one priest and priestess to the next, but the pattern is generally something like this: After receiving the initial complaint, which is often very general—a headache or a stomachache—the priests and priestess call for the aid of their spirit helper. They most likely sit before a domestic altar, recite the rosary, light candles, and purify the floor with holy water, often chanting in a language that is supposed to be African. They then become possessed by their spirit helper, who gives them advice about how to proceed. Usually they then collect a detailed medical history from the patient and the patient's relatives. They may also try to get more specific details through the use of various divination techniques.

If the problem is caused by black magic, the priests and priestesses may have to employ counter-magic techniques, often calling again on their spirit helper. Mischievous or neglected spirits can cause illnesses. Sometimes spirits are purchased and told to make trouble for others. Indeed, much of the Haitian population firmly believes in the existence of sorcery and the effectiveness of sorcerers, though they are rare and difficult to find. A sorcerer may also use bad spirits to cause various diseases, such as tuberculosis and epilepsy.

## **SEXUALITY AND REPRODUCTION**

The health focus in terms of sexuality is clearly on AIDS. One of the poorest countries in the world, Haiti also has the highest seroprevalence rate in the Caribbean and the highest rate outside sub-Saharan Africa. In May 2002 representatives of the Haitian health community met with international AIDS experts to discuss the AIDS pandemic in Haiti. Again the focus was on the harm being perpetuated by the U.S.-sponsored embargo. The problem was no longer labeled simply a health crisis but a national development crisis.

Throughout the meeting the specialists, both American and Haitian, recited the overwhelming statistics of poverty and the high rate of HIV/AIDS in Haiti. It is estimated that Haiti accounts for more than 90% of HIV/AIDS cases in the Caribbean, and the number of children orphaned by the epidemic is estimated as approaching 200,000.

## **HEALTH THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE**

A bibliographic account of works on Haiti in English and Creole lists only 228 items (Lawless, 1992, pp. 194–170). This rather meager literature does not allow for any detailed accounts of the health beliefs, attitudes, and practices as they might change through the life cycle.
