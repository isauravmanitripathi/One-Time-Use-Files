providing education and support for breast-feeding, including those with titles like "Breastfeeding Online," "Breastfeeding Basics," "A Woman's Guide to Breastfeeding," and "Breastfeeding and Parenting Resources on the Internet." One site promised more than 500 links to sites providing breast-feeding information.

Breast-feeding is part of our heritage as mammals, but as culturally embedded human beings, we have an array of choices about infant feeding that no other species or past human population has ever had. Current scientific research has led educated women to choose to feed their infants in the same way that all other mammals do. Similar choices are often out of the hands of poor women in much of the world, but renewed efforts on the part of international organizations target breast-feeding as the single best and least expensive way to improve the health of infants worldwide.

# **WHY DO ANTHROPOLOGISTS STUDY HUMAN GROWTH?**<sup>1</sup>

The study of human growth has been a part of anthropology since the founding of the discipline. European anthropology of the early to mid-19th century was basically anatomy and anthropometry, the science of human body measurements (Tanner, 1981). Early practitioners of American anthropology, especially Franz Boas (1892, 1940) are known as much for their studies of human growth as for work in cultural studies, archeology, or linguistics. Boas was especially interested in the changes in body size and shape following migration from Europe to the United States. At the time of those studies, around 1890–1920, most anthropologists and anatomists believed that stature, and other measurable dimensions of the body such as head shape, could be used as "racial" markers.

The word "race" is set in inverted commas here because it refers to the scientifically discredited notion that human beings can be organized into biologically distinct groups based on phenotypes (the physical appearance and behavior of a person). According to this fallacious idea, northern European "races" were tall and had relatively long and narrow heads, while southern European races were shorter and had relatively round skulls. Boas found that, generally, the children of Italian and Jewish European migrants to the United States were significantly taller and heavier than their parents. The children of the migrants even changed the shape of their heads; they grew up to have long narrow heads. In the new environment of the United States, the children of recent southern European migrants grew up to look more like northern Europeans than their own parents.

Boas used the changes in body size and shape to argue that environment and culture are more important than genes in determining the physical appearance of people. In terms of environment, life in the United States afforded better nutrition, both in terms of the quantity and the variety of food. There were also greater opportunities for education and wage-paying labor. These nutritional and socioeconomic gains are now known to correlate with larger body size. In terms of culture, in particular childrearing practices, there were other changes. In much of Europe infants usually were wrapped up tightly and placed on their backs to sleep, but the American practice at the turn of the century was to place infants in the prone position. In order to be "modern" the European immigrant parents often adopted the American practice. One effect on the infant was a change in skull shape, since pressure applied to the back of the infant's skull produces a rounder head, while pressure applied to the side of the skull produces a longer and narrower head (Walcher, 1905).

The work of Boas and his colleagues shows that an interest in human growth is natural for anthropologists. This is because the way in which a human being grows is the product of an interaction between the biology of our species, the physical environment in which we live, and the social/economic/political environment that every human culture creates. Moreover, all living people share the basic pattern of human growth. That pattern is the outcome of the four million year evolutionary history of the hominids (i.e., living human beings and our fossil ancestors). Thus, human growth and development reflect the biocultural nature and evolutionary history of our species.

### **Human Growth and Medical Anthropology**

Boas argued for nearly 50 years that the study of human growth provides a mirror of the human condition. It is widely accepted today that the patterns of growth of human populations reflect the "material and moral conditions of that society" (Tanner, 1986). Those material and moral conditions are, in large parts, determinants of human health, in terms of physical, social, and emotional well-being. Viewed in this perspective, the study of human growth in its cultural context contributes to many interests of medical anthropology.

### **Biocultural Models of Human Growth**

Human growth is part of the biocultural nature of our species. Since the late 19th century, anthropologists (such as Boas) have used biocultural models of human development. By the mid-20th century, the discovery of the nature of DNA and other fundamentals of developmental biology led to a biocultural model that considered human development as, basically, a biological process which could be influenced to a greater or lesser extent by the social and cultural environment.

By the late 20th century, the biocultural model was revised to show that there is a recurring interaction between the biology of human development and the sociocultural environment. Not only does the latter influence the former, but human developmental biology modifies social and cultural processes as well. Global trends toward taller stature over the past 150 years and toward overweight and obesity in the past 20 years are just two examples of these interactions. Increases in the average height and weight of human individuals and populations have consequences for health, the manufacture of clothing and furniture, physical work capacity, perceptions of desired or ideal body shapes, food production and consumption, demographic structure (fertility, migration, and mortality), and social behavior (Bogin, 2001).

Furthermore, it is now understood that environmental forces, including the social, economic, and political environment, regulate the expression of DNA as much, or more so, than DNA regulates the growth process. One example of this type of biocultural interaction is the evolution of bipedalism, the method of human locomotion unique among the primates. Bipedalism is made possible, in part, by a pattern of growth that alters the size and shape of the skeleton (e.g., legs longer than arms and a relative short and broad pelvis) without adding or deleting any bones found in our ape cousins. It is hypothesized that many crucial feeding, reproductive, social, and cultural adaptations of our species are both a consequence and cause of bipedalism (Morbeck, Galloway, & Zihlman, 1997). These behavioral adaptations selected for the expression and regulation of genes that bring about the human pattern of growth allowing for bipedalism. In a medical sense, bipedalism also brings about many physical

ailments, including lower back pain, fallen arches of the feet, and inguinal hernias. People respond to these liabilities of bipedalism with a wide variety of medical and cultural behaviors, ranging from diet to surgery to psychological and spiritual counseling.

# **LIFE HISTORY THEORY AND HUMAN GROWTH**

The biocultural nature of human growth is best viewed from a life history perspective. The field of life history theory is the scientific study of life cycle strategies and their evolution (Stearns, 1992). Life history refers to major events that occur between the conception and death of an organism. It is defined as the strategy an organism uses to allocate its energy toward growth, maintenance, reproduction, raising offspring to independence, and avoiding death. Living things on earth have greatly different life history strategies, and differences in life history characteristics can have profound effects on the growth dynamics, ecology, and evolution of populations.

Some key elements of life history theory are shown in Table 1. These key points are divided into two columns in the table. The left column lists the basic principles that guide the evolution of life history for any species. The right column lists the trade-offs that shape the particular life history strategy of a species or members of a species. A tradeoff may be thought of as the competition between two biological or behavioral traits. An example of the first type of trade-off is competition between organs or tissues of the body during growth. For example, should energy and materials be devoted to growing a large set of muscles or a larger brain? An example of the second type of trade-off is the choice of producing one large offspring or many, smaller offspring. All living things face these trade-off decisions. Some occur on a day-to-day basis, others occur over longer periods of time. Those that have reproductive consequences and occur over generations are subject to natural selection, and the effected traits may evolve over time.

Human beings are no exception to the dynamics of life history. People share many life history traits and trade-offs with other mammals. As for all mammals, people have evolved strategies of when to be born, when to be weaned, how many and what type of pre-reproductive stages of development to pass through, when to reproduce, and when to die. Human growth serves as a good example of life history traits and trade-offs. In contrast to most

other mammals, people grow slowly and take almost 20 years to reach maturity. The lag between conception and maturity is, in part, a trade-off between speed and quality. Slow human growth delays both the independence of the young and the age at reproduction, but it may payoff in adults with better health and reproductive fitness.

The evolution of human life history can be studied in many ways. One way is to examine the stages of the life cycle. One of the many possible orderings of the events in the human life cycle is shown in Table 2. The remaining discussion is confined to the postnatal life cycle stages, with an emphasis on childhood. These stages are defined in terms of functional biological, behavioral, social, and cognitive characteristics. One of these is change in the rate of growth, as shown in Figure 1. The human "distance" curve, showing the amount of growth in height from birth to age 22 years, is labeled on the right side of the graph. This curve has three phases: an initial phase of rapid growth during infancy, a second prolonged phase of moderate and near-constant growth during the childhood and juvenile stages, and a third phase with the adolescent growth spurt.

These phases are more clearly seen in the velocity curves. The increment of the velocity curve, which **Table 2.** Stages in the Human Life Cycle

represents the rate of growth in height during any year, is labeled on the left side. Changes in the velocity of growth may be divided into five phases, or stages, of human development. These are: (1) infancy; (2) childhood; (3) juvenile; (4) adolescent; and (5) adult stages. Below the velocity curve are symbols indicating the average duration of each stage of development.

Infancy begins at birth and lasts until about age three years. The infant's rate of growth is initially rapid but

decelerates quickly. The infant's growth curve is a continuation of the fetal pattern, in which the rate of growth in length actually reaches a peak in the second trimester of gestation, and then begins a deceleration that lasts until childhood. The childhood stage encompasses the ages of about three to seven years. The growth deceleration of infancy ends at the beginning of childhood, and the rate of growth levels off at about 6 cm per year. This levelingoff in growth rate is unusual for mammals, as virtually all other species continue a pattern of deceleration after infancy. This slower and steady rate of human growth maintains a relatively small-sized body during the childhood years. About 60% of children have a small acceleration in growth rate, called the mid-growth spurt, at the end of childhood.

The human juvenile stage begins at about age seven years, and is characterized by the slowest rate of growth since birth. In girls, the juvenile period ends, on average, at about the age of 10, two years before it usually ends in boys. The difference reflects the earlier onset of adolescence in girls. Human adolescence is the stage of life when social and sexual maturation takes place. In terms of growth, both boys and girls experience a rapid acceleration in the growth velocity of virtually all of the bones of the body. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. Adolescence ends when skeletal growth is complete. This usually marks the achievement of full reproductive maturity, meaning both physical and psychosocial maturity.

In addition to changes in growth rate, each stage may also be defined by characteristics of the dentition,

#### **Why Grow and Develop? 239**

by changes related to methods of feeding, by physical and mental competencies, and by maturation of the reproductive system and sexual behavior. Details on the development of these characteristics may be found in Bogin (1999).

## **WHY GROW AND DEVELOP?**

Organisms grow and develop if they are mortal. Reproduction is necessary to replace those organisms that die, and sexual reproduction requires cell division, the formation of tissues, and other forms of growth. Some forms of life reproduce asexually, in which one or a few cells are contributed by a parent and those cells eventually grow and develop into a new mature individual that is, in many ways, almost identical to the parent. Most species reproduce sexually, requiring a single cell with some biological material from each of two parents. In either case, the initial contribution of cells cannot look or behave in any way like the parent. To be like their parents, " … the new organisms will have to suffer changes before they become something approaching replicas of the old" (Newth, 1970).

### **Plasticity and Continuity during Human Development**

Sexual reproduction and time for growth allow new organisms to develop differences from their parents—the offspring may display plasticity. The term plasticity means a potential for change in the phenotype of the individual caused by a change in the environment (Mascie-Taylor & Bogin, 1995; Stearns, 1992). The fitness of a given phenotype varies across an environment's range of variation. When phenotypes are fixed early in development, such as in mammals that mature sexually soon after infancy, environmental change is positively correlated with high mortality. Examples are mice, rats, and other rodents, which may mature only a few weeks after birth. However, fewer than one out of a thousand newborns survive to maturity.

The process of growth and development is arduous, often prolonged, and generally hazardous. The high rates of death for sex cells, fertilized eggs, embryos, fetuses, newborns, and young attest to these hazards. The pattern of human growth is one of the most prolonged of any mammals and this entails many hazards. In traditional societies of both historic and prehistoric eras, including hunter–gatherers and horticulturists, about 35% of liveborn humans die by age seven years, and less than 60% reach adulthood (Bogin, 1999; Lancaster & Lancaster, 1983). Despite the risks for death, more human beings reach adulthood than any other animal species. The next most successful species after humans is the chimpanzee, but only 35% of live-born chimpanzees reach adulthood. Part of the success of humans is due to the prolonged process of human growth, which allows for greater plasticity in development.

Social mammals such as some carnivores, elephants, and primates, prolong the developmental period by adding a juvenile stage (a period of feeding independence prior to sexual maturation) between infancy and adulthood. Adult phenotypes develop more slowly in these mammals. They experience a wider range of environmental variation, and the result is a better conformation between the individual and the environment. This plasticity leads to an increase in evolutionary fitness, meaning that more offspring can survive to reproductive age. In large mammalian species without a juvenile stage, less than 10% of live-born offspring survive to reproductive age, while between 12% and 30% survive in the social mammals with a juvenile growth stage (Pereira & Fairbanks, 1993).

Human beings have a juvenile stage and add a childhood stage of growth between infancy and the juvenile period. Evidence for the evolution of the childhood growth stage is provided in Bogin (1999). Childhood allows for an additional four years of relatively slow physical growth and behavioral experiences that further enhance developmental plasticity.

### **The Five "Themes" of Human Childhood**

Listed in Table 3 are some of the biosocial traits of human children. Many of these traits are shared with other social

**Table 3.** Biosocial Traits of Human Children

- 1. Slow and steady rate of growth and relatively small body size
- 2. A large, fast-growing brain
- 3. Higher resting metabolic rate than any other mammalian species
- 4. Immature dentition
- 5. Sensitive period for maturation of fundamental motor patterns
- 6. Sensitive period for cognitive and language development
- 7. Weaned, with dependence on older people for care and feeding

mammals, but no other mammalian species has all of these traits. By these criteria, childhood is a stage of growth found only in the human species.

Five "themes" help us to understand the place of childhood in human biology and culture.

- 1. Childhood is a reproductive and feeding adaptation. By the time the childhood growth stage begins at age three years the infant is weaned, meaning that all breast-feeding is finished. Weaning frees the mother from the demands of nursing and the inhibition of ovulation related to continuous nursing. This decreases the interbirth interval and increases reproductive fitness, as human women can reproduce successfully every three years or less, but ape females require four to seven years between successful pregnancies. A trade-off is that human children are still dependent on older individuals for feeding and protection because they do not have the permanent teeth, digestive systems, or motor skills to fend for themselves. The reproductive benefits are so great, however, that on balance childhood and child support social systems may have evolved as a means to provide dependent offspring with food and care while allowing the mother to reproduce new infants.
- 2. The allometry of the growth of the human child releases nurturing and care-giving behaviors in older individuals. Allometry refers to different rates of growth for different parts of the body. At birth, the human head is about 25% of total body length (Figure 2). By age seven years, the brain and cranium achieve almost adult size, but body growth is only 40% complete, dental maturation is only 58% complete, and reproductive maturation is only 10% complete. A series of ethological observations (Lorenz, 1971) and psychological experiments (Alley, 1983; Todd, Mark, Shaw, & Pittenger, 1980) demonstrate that these growth patterns of body, face, and brain allow the human child to maintain a superficially infantile (i.e., "cute") appearance longer than any other mammalian species. The infantile appearance of children facilitates parental investment by maintaining the potential for nurturing behavior of older individuals toward both infants and dependent children (Bogin, 1999; McCabe, 1988).
- 3. Children are relatively inexpensive to feed. The relatively slow rate of body growth and small body size of children reduces competition with adults for food resources, because slowgrowing, small children require less food than bigger individuals. A five year old child of average size (the 50th centile of the NCHS reference curves for growth) and activity, for example, requires 22.7% less dietary energy per day for maintenance and growth than a 10 year old juvenile on the 50th growth centile (Ulijaszek & Strickland, 1993). Thus, provisioning children, though time consuming, is not as onerous a task of investment as it would be, for instance, if both brain and body growth were both progressing at the same rapid rate. Moreover, in times of food scarcity children are protected from starvation by this unique pattern of brain and body growth.
- 4. "Babysitting" and adoption are possible. As children do not require nursing, any competent member of a social group can provide food and care for them. Cross-culturally, juveniles, adolescents, grandmothers, and other kin, both male and

**Figure 2.** Changes in body proportion from birth to adult. The newborn's relatively large head, with large eyes and small chin (not shown) combined with small arms and legs is perceived as "helpless," "cute," or "in need of care" in many human cultures. Infants and children retain these body proportions until at least seven years of age.

female, may provide care for children (Bogin, 1994a; Bogin & Smith, 1996). This type of care-taking is rare in other primates, even for apes. Adoptions of orphaned infants by females do occur in chimpanzee social groups, but only infants older than four years and able to forage for themselves survive more than a few weeks (Goodall, 1983). It seems that the human infant can more easily make new attachments to other caretakers than the chimpanzee infant. The ability of a variety of human caretakers to attach to one or several human infants may also be an important factor. The psychological and social roots of this difference between human and non-human species in attachment behavior are not known. However, this flexibility in attachment behavior allowed, in part, for the evolution of childhood and the reproductive efficiency of the human species.

5. Childhood allows for developmental plasticity. The value of this plasticity was discussed above. Cross-cultural examples of plasticity in human growth are given below.

# **CROSS-CULTURAL EXAMPLES OF CHILD GROWTH**

A great deal of data on human physical growth exist in the literature and some of this has been collected into two volumes by Eveleth and Tanner (1976, 1990). Also see Ulijaszek, Johnston, and Preece (1998). There is relatively little difference between individuals cross-culturally in growth before birth, as birth length clusters at 50 cm and mean birth weight ranges from 2.4 kg to 3.4 kg. To be sure, infants born to smaller, undernourished, or ill mothers may be shorter and weigh less than infants born to taller, heavier, or healthier mothers. Indeed, birth weight serves as an indication of the overall health of the infant, and epidemiologists use the mean birth weight of a social group as an indication of its general quality of life. Even so, more variation between individuals and populations develops with time after birth. By adulthood, the range in stature is from 184 cm for young men in the Netherlands (Fredriks et al., 2000) to 145 cm for Efe Pygmy men (Dietz, Marino, Peacock, & Bailey, 1989). In these and other populations, adult women are from 8 cm to 14 cm shorter than men. Population variation in many other body measurements is detailed in the Eveleth and Tanner volumes cited above.

The African pygmies are short for genetic reasons: they do not produce enough growth hormones or their cells are not sensitive to these hormones. Genetic causes cannot easily explain growth variation between other human populations. The research concerning growth variation is far too copious to review here (see Bogin, 1999; Gray & Wolfe, 1998). Much attention is focused on specific determinants, such as disease and nutrition. Some cross-cultural work cites physical and emotional stress, or child-rearing practices. Children and adults tend to be taller in societies that practice some sort of painful ritual (e.g., scarification, piercing, vaccination) early in life or separate infants from their parents by swaddling or crèching them (Landauer & Whiting, 1981).

These individual factors are important, but the consensus of research is converging on the total quality of life as the main explanation for growth variation. This is because nutritional status and disease are highly correlated with the social, economic, and political conditions of life. The poverty rate, the infant mortality rate, the literacy rate for adults, the school attendance rate for girls, and the mean birth weight of any society may predict child and adult stature as well or better than measures of specific diseases or food intake. Conversely economic and social historians use growth data to assess the quality of life in past centuries, when standard indicators of health and economic development were unavailable.

Since 1992, my own research has focused on the social, economic, and political conditions that influence the growth and health of children of Guatemala Maya immigrants to the United States. Some scholars have called the Maya "Pygmies of the Americas" or otherwise asserted that the Maya are genetically shorter in stature. Our research finds that Maya children between the ages of five to 12 years old, living in Los Angeles, California, and Indiantown, Florida, average 10–11 cm taller than their age-mates living in Guatemala (Bogin, Smith, Orden, Varela Silva, & Loucky, 2002). Our Los Angeles and Indiantown sample includes children born in Guatemala and Mexico, and Maya Americans born in the United States. Greater time in the United States results in greater stature, meaning that the Maya American children are the tallest of all the Maya. This height increase following migration is the largest that has ever been recorded for any human population, and expands the known range of plasticity in human growth. The height increases show that the social, economic, and political conditions of Guatemala holding back human growth are very severe. The increase in stature attests to improvements in nutrition, healthcare, water quality, education, reduced physical labor, and increased physical and emotional security in the United States. However, the Maya children are still, on average, shorter than European Americans, African Americans, and Mexican Americans living in Indiantown, Florida (ethnic group names are based on self-identification by the people of Indiantown). We predict that it will take three or four generations of growth in the United States until Maya Americans achieve the same average height as these other ethnic groups.

## **RISKS FOR CHILDREN**

The pattern of child growth, including dependency on older individuals for food and protection, small body size, slow rate of growth, and delayed reproductive maturation, entails liabilities. Mild-to-moderate energy undernutrition is, perhaps, the most common risk, with estimates that 28% of all children, equaling 150 million, are undernourished in developing nations (UNICEF, 2001). Undernutrition may be due to food shortages alone, but equally likely it is due to work loads and infectious disease loads placed on children that compromise their energy balance (Worthman, 1993). Viewed in historical perspective, unreasonable work loads for children and many childhood diseases are products of the agricultural and industrial revolutions (Sommerville, 1982; Tanner, 1981). Overnutrition, resulting in over-

weight and obesity, is also a problem in both the poor and rich nations. The World Health Organization estimates that worldwide, about one billion people are overweight or obese. Between 20 and 25 million are infants and children. Under- or overnutrition are serious threats to adequate growth, physical and cognitive development, health, and performance at school or work.

Another risk for children in the contemporary world is that of abuse and neglect. One estimate of the worldwide mortality from abuse and neglect is between 13 and 20 infants and children per 1,000 live births (Belsey, 1993). The incidence of all suffering from abuse and neglect is probably higher, but very difficult to estimate since data are not reported by most nations. Some industrialized nations do maintain statistics for non-fatal abuse and neglect of children. In the United States, for example, "in 1991 2.7 million abused or neglected children were reported to child protection agencies" (Kliegman, 1995). This is a rate of 38.6 children per 1,000.

One reason for child abuse and neglect is that the biology of infancy and childhood may not keep pace with the rapidity of technological, social, and ideological change relating to families and their offspring. It is now technologically possible to safely nourish infants without breast-feeding and this allows parents (mothers) an opportunity to pursue activities that separate the mother and her infant. Of course, mothers working away from their infants, be it in agriculture, industry, or other services, do not usually desire to neglect or abuse their infants. Where qualified caretakers are available, such as grandparents or older siblings, the infant may be well attended when the mother is working. When families live under difficult social, economic, and political conditions, especially poverty conditions, mothers may have no alternative but to leave an infant with unqualified caretakers, or even alone.

Reduced or absent breast-feeding may also allow a woman to have another baby sooner. Among the poor populations of the developing countries, short birth intervals (less than 23 months) compromise the health of both the infant and the mother (Huttly, Victoria, Barros, & Vaughn, 1992). A major negative effect on the infant is low birth weight, which is known to impair both physical growth and cognitive development during childhood and later life stages (Crooks, 1995; Garn, Pesick, & Pilkington, 1984; Kliegman, 1995).

In the populations of the more developed nations, such as among the U.S. middle-class, fewer than 20% of infants are breast-fed. In these same countries, the weaning process—from bottles and formula to solid "baby foods"—may begin by three months of age (Detwyller, 1995). This severely curtails the infancy stage of life history, when feeding is evolutionarily designed to be done mostly by breast or bottle. These "premature children" present a problem for care, as they are still biologically within the infancy stage of development and do not possess the physical or emotional capabilities of children. Societies in the developed nations have many programs and devices (e.g., day care for the infants, parent education classes, play equipment) to handle this conflict between biology and culture. Some arrangements work well, but when they do not succeed, and the infant reacts poorly, the frustrated parents or caregivers may respond with abusive or neglectful behavior.

A final example of the consequences of a changing world on the development of children concerns violence and warfare. In 1985 14% of all childhood deaths in the United States were due to violence, up from 4% in the 1960s. Nearly half of all childhood mortality in the United States was due to accidents (Fingerhut & Kleinman, 1989). The accident rate (due to motor vehicles, fires, and drowning) also represents a type of violence to which children are susceptible. Several studies have noted strong associations between socioeconomic status and childhood accidents, including research in the United States (Fingerhut & Kleinman, 1989) and England and Wales (Fox, 1977). Lower social class, especially poverty, is linked with a significantly higher death rate from all types of accidents (Kliegman, 1992).

## **CONCLUSION**

Childhood is a unique stage in the life history of human beings. Prior to the late 1980s standard "textbook" explanations for the value of childhood held that it provides "extra" time for brain development and learning. This is true, but advances in life history theory and analysis of the fossil record of human evolution are now used to associate the initial selective value of childhood more closely to parental strategies to give birth to new offspring and provide care for existing dependent young. Additionally, the childhood stage allows for increased developmental plasticity and fitness for the young. The dependency of

childhood also entails risks. Deviant behavior by older individuals, social groups, and political institutions can adversely and permanently affect children.

A troubled childhood has long-term consequences. The problems of adults who were abused, neglected, subjected to warfare, or poverty as children are often cited. Less openly discussed are undernutrition in the poor nations and overnutrition in the wealthy nations. These are, arguably, the major health threats to the world's children. Both types of malnutrition often lead to severe and costly physical and psychological complications in adulthood. To paraphrase William Wordsworth, the child is father and mother to the adult. It is certainly easier to produce physically healthy and psychologically welladjusted adults if their development conforms to the bioculturally based needs of infancy, childhood, and the other stages of human life history. Medical anthropology has the resources to elucidate the needs of children and the responsibility to promulgate them widely.
