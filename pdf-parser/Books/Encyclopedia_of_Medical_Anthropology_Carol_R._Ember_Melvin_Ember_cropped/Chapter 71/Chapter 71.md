## **LOCATION AND LINGUISTIC AFFILIATION**

Greece is located in the southeastern corner of Europe and occupies the southernmost tip of the Balkan peninsula. Its territory of 131,990 km<sup>2</sup> also includes some two thousand islands, only a few hundred of which are inhabited. Greek, the official language, is a member of the Indo-European family.

### **OVERVIEW OF THE CULTURE**

Greece has a population of approximately 10.6 million. With over four million of its inhabitants residing in Athens, the nation's cultural and political center, and another million in Thessaloniki, Greece is a highly urbanized country. The rural population has been steadily declining since at least World War II and comprises less than 20% of the total population. Today, only about a quarter of Greeks are employed in agriculture. Another quarter work in industry and construction, and nearly half of the population works in the service sector. Tourism, both internal and international, is one of the most dynamic areas of the economy. In 2000, per capita GNP had reached \$15,400. Unemployment, which officially hovers at about 10% of the work force, is a serious and persistent problem (United Nations Development Program, 2001).

Greece was established as a nation-state in 1832, following a protracted war of independence against the Ottoman Empire. The new kingdom of Greece embraced only a fraction of the Greek-speaking population under Ottoman rule however, and irredentism was a recurrent theme in the century that followed. By the early 20th century, expansion of national territory through war, as well as an exceptionally high rate of natural increase, resulted in tremendous population growth. This growth was not easily absorbed by Greece's relatively underdeveloped economy, which consisted of large plantations producing export crops such as currants and small, fragmented peasant holdings growing wheat, olives, and grapes largely for subsistence.

Throughout its history, Greek society has been characterized by sizable communities of Greek-speakers scattered far beyond the lands of its circum-Aegean core. In the 19th century, diaspora Greeks, many of whom were wealthy and well educated, played an important role in the struggle for Greek independence. Beginning around 1890, a massive wave of emigration sent 500,000 Greeks, 90% of them men, abroad, principally to the United States. A second significant wave of emigration began around 1950, when the economic hardship of World War II and the Civil War that followed prompted many to seek work in Canada, Australia, and Western Europe. By the 1990s, however, economic growth had transformed Greece into an attractive destination for thousands of migrants from Albania and the former Eastern bloc countries.

Political instability characterized much of the 19th and 20th centuries. The Greek population suffered terribly from the occupations of German, Italian, and Bulgarian troops during World War II. In 1941–42, close to 200,000 people died of famine. The hardship of the war was followed closely by a devastating Civil War that finally ended in 1950. Hopes of political stability were shattered when a military junta seized power in 1967. Its demise in 1974 signaled a new era in Greek society and politics, as peaceful democratic elections became routine, and new social movements, such as feminism, flourished. Greece's full membership in the European Union in 1981 has been a major impetus for further social and political changes (Clogg, 1979; Gallant, 2001).

The family is the central institution of Greek culture. Individuals derive their primary identity from their family, and ideally, family members provide lifelong support, love, and care to one another. Marriage is regarded as the destiny of men and women, and children are highly desired as sources of happiness in themselves and because they perpetuate the family. Most families are nuclear, but residence patterns vary by region. On the mainland, and especially among shepherds, couples live virilocally, sometimes in the same house as the husband's parents. On the islands of the Aegean, the practice of providing a dowry house to daughters commonly results in uxorilocality and close-knit networks of related women. In urban areas, residence tends to be neolocal (Loizos & Papataxiarchis, 1991).

Nearly all Greeks belong to the Greek Orthodox Church. Although everyday practices do not necessarily correspond to the teachings of the Church, the sensibility of Orthodoxy permeates most aspects of Greek life. Under Ottoman rule, religion was an important means of identifying and governing subject populations. With the founding of the Greek nation, Orthodoxy was appropriated by the state to help forge a sense of national identity (Just, 1989).

Greek cultural identity is premised on the often competing pillars of Greek Orthodoxy, which traces its heritage through Ottoman rule to Byzantium, and the heritage of Classical Greece, as idealized by Western European thinkers (Herzfeld, 1982). The tension between these two legacies has led to what some observers have called a "perennial crisis of national identity." In recent years, integration into the European Union has fostered an increasingly cosmopolitan orientation that favors modernization and development.

# **THE CONTEXT OF HEALTH: ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS**

Greece's health indicators are among the best in the world. Life expectancy at birth in 2000 was 78 years, higher than in the United States and several Western European countries. In 1999, the infant mortality rate was 6 per 1000 live births, and the under-five mortality rate was 7 per 1000. The probability of a female born between 1995 and 2000 surviving to age 65 years was 91.4%; for a man, it was 81.6% (United Nations, 2001).

The economic development of the second half of the 20th century is closely related to the nation's positive health profile, but it cannot fully explain Greece's advantage over many far richer nations. Among the reasons for Greece's favorable indicators are: (1) The continued social significance of strong familial ties, which provide economic and psychological support across the life cycle. Family members commonly rally around pregnant women and new mothers, provide childcare for children when both parents work, and absorb and support the unemployed and the aged. (2) A diet that, despite considerable increase in meat consumption with the growing prosperity still includes abundant consumption of fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes. In recent years, the positive publicity surrounding the health benefits of the so-called "Mediterranean Diet" has helped reverse a local trend away from some traditional foods, such as olive oil. (3) The low rate of divorce and the almost complete absence of births outside of marriage, which elsewhere have been associated with poor health outcomes for infants and children. Abortion is an integral part of Greek contraceptive culture, and pregnancies either lead to marriage or end with abortion. (4) Universal access to health care through the National Health System (ESY, established in 1983), as well as to subsidized prescription drugs.

Beginning in the early decades of the 20th century, and accelerating rapidly after World War II, Greece has witnessed a marked decline in the birth rate. At 1.3 births per woman, the total fertility rate is among the world's lowest. In conjunction with the related "graying" of the population, the low birth rate, known in Greece as "the demographic problem," has become the focus of much official concern and policy debate (Georges, 1996).

Greeks have high frequencies of the genes for the blood disorders beta thalassemia (8% of the population) and G6PD deficiency, both of which have been linked to the endemic malaria that plagued the region until fairly recently. G6PD deficiency is a red blood cell deficiency that can result in acute hemolytic crisis, often provoked by eating fava beans, a food commonly consumed in rural areas, especially during the Lenten period. To avoid the stigma attached to this inherited disorder, hemolytic episodes were popularly attributed to "fava bean poisoning" (Trakas, 1981). Children who inherit the thalassemia gene from both of their parents develop a serious disease characterized by severe anemia starting at a few months of age, distinctive deformities of the facial bones and enlarged spleens. They can only survive with the aid of frequent blood transfusions. Heterozygote individuals manifest only mild anemia and can live normal lives. In some regions of Greece, such as the Dodecanese Islands, up to one third of the local population are carriers of the genes for G6PD deficiency or thalassemia. The Greek government has mounted highly successful public health campaigns to screen for the trait and educate the public about thalassemia, known popularly as the "stigma" in Greek. As a consequence of aggressive prenatal screening, fewer than ten infants a year are born with thalassemia major.

### **MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS**

Over 90% of the Greek population are covered by some form of health insurance to which both employers and employees contribute. Of the approximately 35,000 physicians working in Greece, two thirds are employed by the National Health System and one third work in fulltime or part-time private practices. There is an ongoing oversupply of medical doctors in Greece, many of whom may wait years for a job opening in the public sector (Colombotos & Fakiolas, 1993).

Lay practitioners such as bonesetters, practical midwives and herbalists were important providers of health care in rural areas through the middle of the 20th century. Today, however, they are completely extinct. In recent years, complementary healing traditions such as homeopathy have become available in the major cities as alternatives to biomedicine.

# **CLASSIFICATION OF ILLNESS, THEORIES OF ILLNESS, AND TREATMENT OF ILLNESS**

The biomedical model of disease is unquestionably hegemonic in contemporary Greece. Many older beliefs about demonic forces and spirits as the causes of serious illness have almost completely disappeared. Nevertheless, classification, etiology, and treatment of illness are characterized by a situation of medical pluralism, as biomedicine coexists with longstanding and persistent humoral models, religious healing, and belief in the evil eye and witchcraft. Furthermore, aspects of the biomedical model display specifically Greek inflections.

#### **Demonic Forces**

Up until the middle of the 20th century, many Greeks living in rural areas maintained belief in a variety of demonic forces known collectively as the *xotika*, forces existing "outside" (*exo*) the bounds of Greek Orthodox Christianity. Haunting the woods, streams, and crossroads beyond the protected enclosure of the community, these forces were prone to attack people during liminal periods in the life cycle, particularly pregnancy, birth, and the postpartum, and at the time of one's wedding. Unless protected by symbols and objects associated with the Greek Orthodox Church, such as crosses, icons, amulets, phylacteries, holy water, or olive oil, a person encountering these demonic forces could fall seriously ill or become paralyzed, lose their sanity, and eventually die. These beliefs today are chiefly found among the oldest Greeks, who only reluctantly divulge them to avoid the derision of the younger generations (Stewart, 1991).

### **Humoral Pathology**

Humoral understanding of health and illness underpinned many of the everyday practices of Greeks until relatively recently and still guides aspects of popular health care. Humoral theory was premised on an essentially Galeno-Hippocratic approach to the body that understood health and illness prevention in terms of maintaining an equilibrium between the opposed qualities of "hot" and "cold." These qualities could be literally thermal, as in cold currents of air or water, or metaphorically so, as in the symbolically "cold" valence of particular foods, such as lemons. Illness was caused by a two-step process: first, a person became vulnerable when their body's thermal balance was somehow disturbed; then, exposure to an assault of excessive "hot" or "cold" precipitated an episode of illness. Diagnosis was normally a retrospective process that reconstructs a person's recent history of vulnerability and exposure to specific environmental insults. Deducing the etiology of an illness and deciding on a diagnostic label, in turn, pointed the way to appropriate therapy through the application of the "principle of opposites": illness caused by "cold" is treated with "hot" therapies, and vice versa. This humoral logic persists today, and is implicit in many daily practices whose aim is to protect the body from exposure to cold assaults.

### **Evil Eye**

Another common cause of illness is the evil eye, *to kako mati*. The evil eye is the conscious or unconscious product of human envy. Its vector is a psychic force that emanates from the eyes. Ultimately, the evil eye derives from the devil: it is the devil's work if people are envious and covet the good fortune or possessions of others (Campbell, 1964; Herzfeld, 1986). Once struck by this malignant force, the person who is the object of envy may take ill, or if the coveted object is inanimate, a car, for instance, it may begin to malfunction (Stewart, 1991). The evil eye may also be inadvertently caused by more benign admiration, even on the part of those closest to a person and who otherwise sincerely wish them well. Whatever the origins and intentions, the harmful consequences are the same: headaches, body aches, depression, and severe illness (Blue, 1991). To forestall the undesirable effects of the evil eye, and to avoid being blamed for causing another's misfortune, one should either avoid making compliments, especially of babies and children, who are thought to be especially vulnerable to the evil eye, or be thoughtful enough to bracket one's admiration with an apotropaic gesture: formulaic spitting, or making the sound of spitting ("ftou") three times, or uttering a ritual phrase.

### **Religious Healing**

Religious healing in Greece encompasses a wide variety of practices, ranging from supplications and promises in the form of vows made privately to a saint or to the Panayia, or All Holy One, as the Madonna is most commonly addressed in Greek, to dramatic public displays of selfsacrifice performed during pilgrimages to specialized shrines (Dubisch, 1995). Although women predominate, both genders participate in healing rituals for the gamut of illnesses, from mouth sores (Stewart, 1991) to cancer. Some holy personages specialize in particular ailments or body parts, while others, such as the Panayia, have more general capabilities and may be called upon for all sorts of ills. In addition, the Panayia has her local manifestations, and some of these may be specialists in particular illnesses.

### **Mental Health**

Mental illness, popularly associated with violent behavior, is highly stigmatized and infused with strong sentiments of shame for both the patient and his or her family. Severe mental illness is believed to be inherited through the blood. Thus, the mental illness of one family member may affect the chances of marriage of others in the family. For this reason, efforts may be made to conceal mental illness or to isolate the afflicted family member in a mental asylum.

Mental illness is commonly expressed through somatic complaints, such as headaches and chest pains, and through culturally specific idioms of distress, such as "nerves" *nevra*, and lack of *kefi*, roughly glossed as a positive mood that is associated with high spirits and zest for life. To avoid the stigma associated with the profession of psychiatry, sufferers usually seek care from internists, who will often prescribe tranquilizers. They may also prefer to visit a neurologist who will treat their "nerves." Mental illness may also be attributed to the evil eye, possession by the devil, or to black magic, in which case, religious and magical practitioners may be consulted in addition to internists and psychiatrists. Pilgrimages may be undertaken to holy sites to pray and make votive offerings to saints and to the Panayia for the patient's recovery (Blue, 1991).

Greek psychiatrists, aware of the intense stigma attached to mental illness, often avoid precise diagnoses, such as schizophrenia, in favor of more vague, but less socially damaging labels (Blue, 1991).

### **SEXUALITY AND REPRODUCTION**

Sexual norms and attitudes have changed dramatically over the last few decades. In the past, chastity was a

#### **Health through the Life Cycle 685**

highly valued component of an unmarried woman's identity and reflected positively on the reputation and honor of her entire family. Men, in contrast, were believed to be physically incapable of enduring abstinence for any length of time, and their sexuality was not confined to marriage in the same way as was a woman's (Hirschon, 1989).

In contemporary Greece, the historical value placed on virginity is often described as a "taboo," a relic of the past that has been transcended. Sexual intercourse is now a routine element in courtship, and many brides are pregnant when they marry (Loizos & Papataxiarchis, 1991). However, Greeks have an almost negligible rate (approximately 1%) of births outside of marriage, as unwanted pregnancies are almost always aborted (Agrafiotis & Mandi, 1997).

The one to two child family is today the norm, if not precisely the ideal. Family size is limited primarily through the use of condoms, coitus interruptus and abortion. Abortion has been legal since 1986, but safe medical abortions were available and widely resorted to decades before legalization. Greek women and couples have a marked aversion to medical means of contraception: only 2% of Greek women use the pill and another 7% use the IUD. Abortion is used as a backup when the less reliable, but vastly more popular methods of birth control fail, or fail to be used. An estimated 200,000–300,000 abortions occur each year, in a country with roughly 100,000 live births. Across the political spectrum, the low birth rate and high abortion rate have caused alarm, and concerns for the continuity of the Greek nation and "race" are commonly voiced in the media and other public arenas (Georges, 1996).

Homosexuality, especially among men, and in particular for the passive partner, was highly stigmatized in the past. In recent years, the loan word "gay" has begun to replace the older, pejorative terms and new sexual identities are being articulated. The islands of Mykonos and Mytilene have emerged as popular destinations for both internal and international gay and lesbian tourism.

## **HEALTH THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE**

#### **Pregnancy and Birth**

In the prewar period, pregnancy was not regarded as a state that required the care, advice, and esoteric knowledge of specialists. Pregnancy was nonetheless a condition marked by special behaviors that were carefully observed by the pregnant woman and those around her. Because children were regarded as sacred "gifts from God," the pregnant woman, as bearer of this gift, was herself imbued with a sort of sacred aura. As a consequence, not only her immediate family and wider circle of kin, but her co-villagers generally, treated her with special consideration, forbearance, and respect. Pregnant women, for example, could demand and expect special foods to satisfy their cravings. After their fifth month or so, they could sit comfortably with their legs apart, an immodest posture that would otherwise certainly have provoked criticism and gossip (Chryssanthopoulou, 1984).

If carrying a child conferred a sacred aura and a degree of behavioral latitude on a woman, it also increased her vulnerability to a panoply of dangerous forces. Pregnancy was among those desirable states and qualities, such as youth and beauty, which acted like magnets for demons eager to attack and destroy both the woman and the new life within her (Stewart, 1991). Thus, by virtue of her pregnancy, a woman entered into an endangered state from which she would emerge only at the completion of the 40-day postpartum period.

By far the most significant dietary rule during pregnancy concerned the aroma of cooking food. If a pregnant woman smelled a food as it was being prepared, she was obligated to taste at least a bite. Failure to do so could cause something to go badly awry with the pregnancy. In the worst case, a miscarriage could result; in the best of outcomes, the baby would be born with a birthmark in the shape of the food not eaten on the precise spot that its mother happened to scratch after catching the scent of the food.

In the past, each village had at least one practical midwife, known as the *mammi*. The midwife assisted and supported the woman throughout her labor and delivery, and visited her daily during the week following the birth to examine her and the infant, wash the infant's clothes, and help clean the house. When called to assist a birth, the midwife examined the woman internally to determine her dilation and to ascertain the baby's position. If the baby did not present head first, the midwife attempted to turn it internally by inserting her fingers and manipulating the baby's limbs. External version was also performed by having the woman lie on a blanket held by several people who then tossed her in the air. To prevent tearing and to help women achieve an optimal state of "openness" essential for a successful birth, midwives massaged the perineum with olive oil or soap. The auspicious state of openness was also sympathetically invoked by always leaving the windows and doors of the house slightly open during the birth. In many parts of Greece, husbands removed their clothes, unbuttoned their shirts, and loosened their belts for the same purpose (Chryssanthopoulou, 1984).

Women usually gave birth in a sitting or semireclining position, often astride special birthing stools. To help the woman to push more effectively, in the Dodecanese Islands, a rope was tied to the iron window bars for women to pull down on. In Northern Greece, midwives put some of the exhausted woman's hair in her mouth, causing her to gag and automatically contract her abdominal muscles.

**Postpartum.** The postpartum period was the most richly elaborated dimension of a woman's procreative experience. The 40-day seclusion period represented a kind of symbolic death and entombment after the act of physiological birth. During this period, the woman who had just given birth, known as the *lehona*, was said to live with "one foot in the grave." Ideally, she should not leave her house for the full 40 days. Confinement protected both her and her newborn from the many dangers, both spiritual and physical, that literally threatened their lives. Safely tucked away within the house, whose every means of entry was guarded by layers of protective devices, woman and infant were buffered from the spiritual attack of the demons whose malevolent designs, activated by her pregnancy, were now driven into high gear with the arrival of new life. At the same time, the *lehona* herself was considered polluting and her isolation and confinement were necessary to prevent the endangerment of others as well. Only at the conclusion of the postpartum period, marked by the special Orthodox ritual of "churching," would both woman and child be safely incorporated into the social life of the community.

Today, pregnancy and birth have become fully medicalized. In distinct contrast to the prewar period, elaborate attention is now focused on the prenatal period as opposed to the postpartum. Women are intensively monitored throughout their pregnancies by a battery of procedures. Fetal ultrasound imaging is universal, and on average, Greek women are scanned four times per pregnancy. The rate of birth by cesarean section has risen rapidly in recent years, from 16% in 1988 to about 40% today. There is no "natural childbirth" movement in Greece, and all births now occur in the hospital (Georges, 1997).

### **Infancy**

In the past, infants were not immediately nursed after birth. The colostrum, the clear, nutritious fluid that precedes the first flow of milk, was always expressed and discarded. In contrast to the colostrum, which, perhaps because of its transitional status, had an ambiguous valence that led to its avoidance, breast milk was regarded as a pure and even quasi-sacred substance. It was used to cure eye ailments of all sorts (Blum & Blum, 1965). Until its mother's milk came in, the infant was spoon-fed chamomile tea. Chamomile also helped the baby expel the meconium, its first, dark sticky stools, and clear the phlegm from its throat. Although the infant was a highly desirable, even quasi-sacred presence, these effluvia were considered "dirty," and had to be eliminated from its body before nursing could begin. Chamomile tea was also occasionally fed to the baby afterward as well, especially if it had a stomach problem. Mothers nursed their infants exclusively for the first 5 or 6 months. At that time, weaning foods, often made of toasted wheat flour, were introduced.

On the third, fifth or seventh day after birth, depending on the region of Greece, a "salting" ritual was performed. The infant's body was rubbed with salt and then bathed. Salt, which has positive connotations and protective powers in Greek culture, helped the baby develop physical toughness, good sense and a logical mind, and "cured" its skin, just as meats were cured for preservation, to prevent rashes.

Infants were wrapped in three layers of inner cloths and then swaddled from head to toe. Swaddling helped the baby's legs to grow straight (although more than one woman I interviewed during my research observed that her child had turned out bow-legged, nonetheless). Swaddling also effectively immobilized the infant and made it easier for women to mind as they went about their chores. When mothers removed the swaddling cloth to change or bathe their babies, they vigorously stretched the infants' limbs to help them develop properly. Stretching was done according to a standard formula, with each leg or arm first gently tugged and then crossed over to touch the opposite leg or arm.

From its ears to its feet, the infant's body was the focus of intense attention and concern, and mothers followed a number of practices to encourage its proper physical and esthetic development. In the weeks following the birth, the new mother was fed plenty of soup made from roosters so that the baby's neck would become strong. To

#### **Health through the Life Cycle 687**

insure that the baby developed a well-shaped head and to prevent colds, a special head covering was worn continuously for at least the first 2 months. To prevent one side of the head from becoming flatter than the other, mothers took care to turn their swaddled infants at least twice a day and after each nighttime feeding.

#### **Childhood and Adolescence**

Today, as in the past, considerable vigilance is exercised to prevent children from catching a chill. As with infants, young children may be bundled in layers of clothing that from an American perspective would seem excessive (Sutton, 1998). In the past, girls in particular, were admonished not to stand in pools of cold water or walk barefoot or sit on a cold tile floor, lest the currents of cold air or water attack their womb and cause health problems or even infertility later on. In the past, young girls generally were not told about menstruation, and menarche was often a frightening experience.

Improvements in nutrition and sanitation have resulted in a secular increase in height among Greeks. Average height over the last 70 years has increased 9 cm for boys and 7 cm for girls. Mean age at menarche has decreased to 12.1 years. In recent years, childhood obesity has become increasingly common (Papademetriou, 1999).

In contemporary Greece, older children and adolescents are subjected to considerable stress from the demands of the highly competitive educational system. To pass the grueling exams that until very recently were required for entry into the prestigious national university system, students had to study long hours and attend private cram schools in the afternoons and evenings.

### **Adulthood**

As in the past, marriage continues to mark the passage to full adulthood for Greek men and women. Even in contemporary Greece, marriage is usually the first time that individuals will establish an independent household.

Patterns of parenting have undergone massive changes in the postwar period. Older gendered idioms of maternal suffering and sacrifice have been largely replaced by the discourse of "stress" and "anxiety," as likely to be heard from fathers as from mothers. Both motherhood and fatherhood have been profoundly rewritten, each in their own ways, by the child-centered, emotionally-intensified, financially taxing, consumerist model of contemporary parenting. The Greek context stands out for the intensity with which children's education is culturally valued as a means for confronting an increasingly uncertain future (Tsoukalas, 1977). The cultural expectation that parents will make every effort to assist children in obtaining formal schooling as well as the "shadow education" provided by private cram schools has generated considerable stress and anxiety for parents. To facilitate their children's educational advancement, mothers may forego their daughters' help with housework and fathers may work extra hours or take a second job to pay for their children's private classes. In many parts of Greece, an added burden is the expectation that parents will provide their daughters with a dowry, often in the form of an apartment or house.

**Menopause.** Middle-aged Greek women regard menopause with some ambivalence. Because the regular flow of blood in the form of menses is an important mechanism for cleansing a woman's body and renewing her health, the cessation of menses is seen by many older women as a harbinger of health problems. On the other hand, menopause puts an end to the constant worry about unwanted pregnancy and the need for abortions, especially acute among Greek women because of the lower reliability of the forms of the most popular birth control methods. Menopause remains largely unmedicalized in contemporary Greece (Beyene, 1989).

### **The Aged**

Institutionalization of the infirm elderly is rare in Greece. The aged are usually cared for by their families, and increasingly, by immigrant home caretakers. Grandmothers in particular often provide valuable household labor and assistance with childcare and housework that enables their daughters to work full-time.

### **Dying and Death**

In rural areas of Greece, a priest is summoned to pray over the dying person and offer communion. At the moment of death, the soul leaves the body through the mouth. The body of the deceased is washed, dressed in new clothes, and laid out in the house. The closest female relatives express their grief by donning black clothes, and kerchiefs, crying and singing heart-wrenching laments known as *miroloyia*. The deceased must be buried within moral and spiritual status of the dead: clean white bones indicate that sins have been forgiven and that the soul of the deceased has entered paradise (Danforth, 1982; Panourgiá, 1995).

## **CHANGING HEALTH PATTERNS**

Into the early decades of the 20th century, the major killers were infectious diseases such as malaria, which affected an estimated two thirds of the Greek population, tuberculosis, and diarrhea. Today, the top causes of mortality in Greece are the well-known "diseases of civilization": heart disease, cancer, and stroke. To date, Greece has among the lowest rates of HIV/AIDS infection in the European Union. Automobile accidents are a major cause of death. Smoking rates are also very high.
