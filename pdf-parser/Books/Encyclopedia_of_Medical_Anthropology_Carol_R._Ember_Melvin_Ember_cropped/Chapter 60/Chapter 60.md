# **Baliem Valley Dani**

#### **Leslie Butt**

## **ALTERNATIVE NAMES**

The Baliem valley Dani are also known as the Dani and the Grand Valley Dani. The term Dani used here does not include the neighboring Western Dani, the Lani, or the Yali, who have been called "Dani" in the past.

### **LOCATION AND LINGUISTIC AFFILIATION**

The Dani live in the 50 km-long Baliem valley, Jayawijaya district, Papua (also known as West Papua, or Irian Jaya), Indonesia. The valley is located 1,500 m above sea level in the middle of the mountain range which cuts through the center of the island of New Guinea. New Guinea was divided by colonizers in the 19th century; the Baliem valley sits on the western side and was part of the Dutch East Indies colony. Since 1969, the former Dutch colony has been incorporated into Indonesia. The Baliem valley Dani are speakers of the Papuan language, Dani, which falls into the Greater Dani language family.

### **OVERVIEW OF THE CULTURE**

The Dani are well known because of the excitement that accompanied the discovery of their complex culture, terraced gardens, and densely populated communities in a mountainous region previously thought to be uninhabited. In 1938, an American pilot spotted from the air the valley's tracts of symmetrical gardens and circular dwellings. Excitement over this New Guinea discovery was intense, and the press dubbed the valley "Shangri-La." In the early 1960s, Harvard University organized a large expedition to the region. The well-known film *Dead Birds* (Gardner, 1963) and now-classic ethnography (Gardner & Heider, 1968; Heider, 1970, 1979; see also van Baal, Galis, & Koentjaraningrat, 1984) from this period have helped to fix the Dani as central to the global imagination about "primitive" populations and integral to the study of tribal cultures within the field of anthropology.

The outside world may not have known of the Baliem valley, but people have settled there and cultivated gardens for at least 7,000 years (Golson & Gardner, 1990). At present, the patrilineal Dani number some 60,000, and display the highest levels of cultural intensification and political integration of any group in the New Guinea highlands (Shankman, 1991). For their food staple, the Dani rely on root crops such as the sweet potato, introduced about 300 years ago, and the indigenous taro, which women cultivate in gardens on the valley floor and mountainsides. Women also raise pigs, which men strategically exchange to promote their status, and to strengthen their political alliances. People identify themselves by membership in a totemic clan. In the past, clans grouped into multi-layered political units, and large-scale pre-contact warfare dominated political activities (Heider, 1970). Even after pacification in the 1970s, clan groups still align to form large political alliances. Leadership is achieved through prowess in politics and exchange relations.

Dani men use their influence in the public arena to try to regulate the lives of women. The Dani are polygynous, and most men seek to acquire more than one wife, with between 36% (Aso-Lokobal, n.d.; Peters, 1975) and almost 50% (Butt, 1998; Heider, 1979) of men having at least two wives. Dani society is divided into two moieties, *weta* and *waya*. A person may not marry within his or her moiety. Marriage occurs ideally within a six- to sevenyear cycle, culminating in a big pig feast, the *ebe akho*. In this feast, young girls either choose their marriage partner or have their partner arranged by their parents. The big pig feast is the climax of several ceremonial cycles which also include funerals and boys' initiation (Heider, 1972; Peters, 1975).

Dani gender roles are strongly demarcated. The strict division of labor appears to favor men, for women do most of the hard physical labor in gardens, and do not engage in the male-only rituals that give political power. Household compounds are divided into men's houses (*pilamo*) and family spaces. Women are forbidden to enter the *pilamo*, where sacred objects are stored. However, women expect support from husbands and male kin in domestic matters, and will run away or refuse to marry an unappealing suitor. About 30% of married women have ever run away from their husbands or former husbands (Butt, 2001c; O'Brien, 1969). As Peters (1975) summarizes, women are subject to men in this society, but they are by no means subservient.

Inroads into long-standing gender and social roles began in earnest when the first mission floatplanes landed in 1954. Although neighboring societies underwent mass conversion to Christianity, with many burning all their sacred ritual objects (O'Brien & Ploeg, 1964), the Dani remained uninterested. Instead, the Dani attacked police, resisted schooling, and refused to wear clothes (Peters, 1975). More rapid acculturation processes began in the late 1960s and early 1970s, as the former Dutch colony was handed over to Indonesia in 1969 in a contested vote. Under Indonesian rule, large-scale Dani warfare was stopped. Authorities further prohibited the custom of cutting off portions of the fingers of young Dani girls to commemorate a dead ancestor during a funeral. Government officials also implemented a process of "Indonesianization." A new lingua franca, a national education curriculum, and increased exposure to other Indonesians were meant to assimilate Papuans into the broader nation (Gietzelt, 1989). In 1971, "Operation Penis Gourd," for example, air-dropped clothing into the Baliem valley as part of an effort to "civilize" the Dani, who normally only wore penis gourds and grass skirts. Despite these efforts, the Dani were and remain largely self-sufficient, rejecting many aspects of modernization, Christianity, and Indonesian rule.

Since the 1960s, there has been overt, active resistance by the Dani and other indigenous groups to incorporation into Indonesia. However, up to 8,000 Indonesian migrants have moved to the Baliem valley, and most of them live in Wamena, a prosperous town built alongside the airstrip. Immigrants mostly run the government offices, businesses, and the military. The valley has many police posts and military barracks; these, along with racist and inequitable policies, have heightened resentment among the Dani. In 2000, in partial revenge for political deaths from the past four decades, and following police intervention into an independence rally, Dani activists massacred several families of Indonesian migrants. This tragic incident brings home the extent to which an imagined "Shangri-La" is in fact a contested territory enmeshed within the complex politics of a militarized state. Health and healing needs to be understood as much from the context of these political realities as from the cultural perspective of the inward-looking, self-interested Dani.

# **THE CONTEXT OF HEALTH: ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL FACTORS**

Health challenges in the highlands of Papua are numerous. There are three major impediments to Dani wellbeing: environmental challenges; changing disease patterns; and unequal access to poor quality allopathic health services.

For most highland New Guinea populations, abundant rainfall, high altitude, and inhospitable terrain make horticulture a constant challenge. Populations living below 1,000 m must battle with endemic malaria. Above 1,800 m, misting from clouds limits agriculture. In contrast, the Dani live at 1,500 m, an altitude with more moderate rainfall, and in a region that favors dense cultivation. The Dani are self-sufficient in food production, with the sweet potato forming 90% of their diet. Pigs form an important supply of protein. Thus, the Dani are taller, more husky, and overall healthier than their neighbors, many of whom picture the Baliem as "a sort of paradise, where pigs abound" (Peters, 1975, p. 72).

Nevertheless, Dani health is affected by environmental constraints. Infant mortality rates are high. Ethnographic and local estimates range between 110/1,000 and 250/1,000 (Butt, 1999; WATCH, 1994), although government figures cite lower rates (cf. World Bank, 1991). The biggest health risks are pneumonia and other upper-respiratory infections, which cause over 50% of recorded infant deaths (WATCH, 1994). Smoke-filled traditional dwellings contribute to high rates of respiratory infection among children and adults.

Birth rates are low; the average number of children per family is around 1.5 children (Butt, 1998; Lokobal, 1992). Almost no mothers have more than three children. Women cite the risks associated with childbirth and the arduous work of caring for both garden and children as reasons for limiting family size. Women also lose autonomy if they have a second child, for it is harder to find a new husband if they have many children.

An overall low-protein diet takes its toll on growth patterns. Malnutrition rates increase as children grow. At 36 months, 7% of Dani children weigh less than 11 kg, and at 5 years, over 25% of children have poor nutrition

#### **Medical Practitioners 593**

(WATCH, 1994). Fifty percent of children's growth patterns fall below established norms for Indonesia (Muslim, 1995).

Among adults, upper-respiratory infections remain a serious cause of illness. Smoky huts, combined with almost universal cigarette smoking of indigenous tobacco, make pneumonia and tuberculosis major health problems throughout the valley for adults of all ages.

Disease patterns are changing but most health problems remain acute. Malaria has gone from being absent in the valley in the 1950s to becoming a major killer of adults. Cerebral malaria, a fatal form, became a serious local concern after an outbreak in 1987 (Sudjito, 1987). Malaria Tropicana, in a 1998 outbreak, also claimed many deaths (Hanevik, 2000). Seven cases of HIV have been recorded from a random sample of 195 adults (Ingkokusumo, 2000). Actual rates of HIV infection are almost certainly higher. Within the valley, sexuallytransmitted diseases have become a serious problem. In 1995, 50% of commercial sex workers in Wamena (including Dani and non-Dani respondents) tested positive for gonorrhea, 36% had chlamydia, and 25% had syphilis (Ingkokusumo, 2000). A survey in 1991 showed that 8% of adult hospital patients (including Dani and non-Dani respondents) had gonorrhea (Senis, 1995).

The last factor inhibiting higher standards of Dani health is poor-quality health services. There have been some successes. Since 1954, missionaries in some areas have carefully trained indigenous nurses in basic diagnosis and treatment, and still supply medicine and equipment. Two early campaigns successfully eradicated endemic health problems. The first controlled the incidence of endemic goiter by widely distributing iodized salt. The second campaign reduced the suffering caused by yaws (also known as framboesia), a chronic infectious skin disease. Among the Dani, yaws often progressed to the stage of open skin ulcers, at times eating away flesh, muscle, and joints (Gajdusek, 1961). Missionaries gained an early foothold in Dani communities by publicly curing known yaws cases with a single shot of penicillin.

Most other health interventions, however, have been markedly less successful. Indonesian health care programs put in place in the 1970s implement national health goals, often at the expense of local health needs. This format has been successful in reducing mortality rates in other parts of Indonesia (Yahya & Roesin, 1990). In Wamena, the government runs a hospital that is clean and comfortable, and the Dani will use it under certain conditions. At most smaller health centers and clinics run by trained Dani workers, however, medicines are unavailable, out of date, or improperly administered (Hartono, Romdiarti, & Djohan, 1999; Ingkokusumo, 2000). The health bureaucracy is controlled by Indonesian migrants who are perceived by the Dani as inaccessible and often racist (Butt, 1998; Hull & Hartono, 1999). Knowledgeable health advocates focus on increasing maternal education as a way to improve the health of women and children, yet they recognize that these aims often contradict Dani values, which do not privilege the education or autonomy of women (Hartono et al., 1999; Srini, 1999). Nonetheless, many women have been reluctant to bring their children for immunizations, in part because diseases prevented by the injections are not yet present in the highlands. Many women also reject Indonesia's family planning efforts, which promote the use of the long-term contraceptives Norplant and Depo-Provera, because they already have low birth rates.

### **MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS**

There are three kinds of people with specific healing skills who contribute to the well-being of the Dani: part-time healers with specific practical skills, sometimes known as *hathale*; ritual participants, who seek to control the sacred realm; and trained health workers called *mantri*.

First, *hathale*, or part-time healers, span several realms. Many *hathale* are women. Some women have expertise in assisting with childbirth. Other women are experts at performing abortions. Others know herbal remedies or can perform small curing ceremonies. Certain individuals, mostly women (Heider, 1979), are known to be powerful practitioners of the arts of magic. They can cast spells and can sometimes cure the sick. Overall, there is no special status accorded to these healers.

An important healer role is played by participants in rituals designed to control sickness, food, and the threat of enemies. Political leaders have "to be able to involve the ancestral ghosts in the affairs of the group" (Ploeg, 2001, p. 34) and one way of demonstrating this is by bringing about good health through successful ritual practice. Most of these rituals involve killing a pig, cutting it up, cooking it, and eating it in a systematic manner (see Aso-Lokobal, n.d.; Lokobal, 1994; Peters, 1975). Pig sacrifices are intended to placate ancestors, thus ensuring

fertile gardens, fecund women, and a healthy and prosperous population. Failure to carry out the rituals in their correct time and order can explain misfortune, sickness, and misery. The most important of these rituals is the *kaneke hakasin*, but Aso-Lokobal (n.d.) tallies 94 distinct rituals related to Dani health. In sum, political leaders produce Dani well-being, not by directly healing the sick, but by the successful execution of rituals.

Lastly, some Dani have undergone two years of nursing training, and are called *mantri*. For a small fee, *mantri* working in government clinics will dispense some medicines, treat wounds, and promote government health programs such as family planning. *Mantri* often find themselves in a position of conflict. On the one hand, all *mantri* believe in the power of Dani rituals to provide physical well-being through mediating social and spiritual relationships. On the other hand, they also dispense with confidence the medicines that they believe will heal their sick patients. Discretion in mediating two often competing belief systems is key to their success. One *mantri* summarizes a common strategy: "Never tell a patient you know he believes in spirits. Never tell them what disease they have. Just give them the medicine" (Butt, 1998, p. 199).

# **CLASSIFICATION OF ILLNESS, THEORIES OF ILLNESS, AND TREATMENT OF ILLNESS**

Traditional beliefs about ancestor spirits or supernatural powers are intricately interwoven into Dani imaginings about why and how people become sick. The rich world of Dani *wesa* (the supernatural) includes ancestor spirits, magical powers, and forest and animal spirits. These intersect with the natural world, contemporary medical services, and individual illness in complex and often idiosyncratic ways. In the main, "illness and death are always considered to be more or less directly caused by ghosts" (Heider, 1970, p. 227).

One belief common to all Dani is the importance of "soul matter" or *etai-egen*. Each person who is born needs to grow an *etai-egen* over the course of his or her lifetime. The *etai-egen* is an immaterial substance that rests lodged just beneath the sternum. Throughout adult life the *etai-egen* is continually subject to potential disturbance or weakening, particularly through the work of malicious ghosts. Explanations for illness causation often refer to a weakened, shrunken, or disturbed *etai-egen*.

Another widespread belief is that ancestors, sorcery, and malicious spirits cause the majority of serious illnesses. Sometimes ancestors cause sickness directly (Lokobal, 1994). At other times, an individual's actions can cause another person to become sick. Theft, laziness, or disobedience on the part of one person can make a close relative sick. A man who has engaged in extramarital sexual relations, for example, might explain his wife's subsequent reproductive problems as punishment for his errant behavior.

Another form of illness can be brought about when an individual manipulates the spirit world. Vengeful sorcerers or jealous competitors can make another person sick. For example, *imak* sorcerers can cause small crablike animals to leap into a man's penis if he urinates in a dangerous place. Sorcerers can poison food using a fine, white powder invisible to the target's eye (Gardner & Heider, 1968). Sorcerers often try to poison people from enemy alliances. Lastly, certain illnesses are always caused by angry spirits or sorcery. These include uncontrollable seizures, "inner heat" ( *panas dalam*), mental disability, a high fever, and dry cough.

For the Dani, diagnosis of disease is an important art. Sickness will not leave the body, they believe, until a correct diagnosis has been made. Depending on the diagnosis, the sick person or his or her relative will choose from an array of treatment options. The hierarchy of resorts normally follows this pattern: (1) do nothing; (2) use herbal remedies or engage in bloodletting; (3) consult clan *hathale* who may use one of several diagnostic techniques, including blowing on the head of the sick person, dissecting a rat, eating a ritual pig, or preparing protection for the patient's *etai-egen*; (4) pray to the Christian God; or (5) consult a healer from outside the clan.

Most Dani look to the realm of the spirits to diagnose sickness and place clinics and Christian prayer a distant second. A "devout" Christian might immediately seek help from a healer to diagnose sickness, and only resort to prayer once the treatment begins to work. One informant summarized the trend of using allopathic medicine not as a treatment resort, but as a diagnostic tool for understanding the effects of ancestor spirits:

Government clinic medicine is just play medicine, not really important at all, just pills. Government clinic medicine is a test to see whether a sickness is really ancestors and magic or not, not a real treatment resource at all (L. Matuan cited in Butt, 1998, p. 193).

### **SEXUALITY AND REPRODUCTION**

Dani sexuality has been a topic of active debate in anthropology, beginning with Karl Heider's (1976) argument that the Dani had a "low energy" sexual system. Heider had observed a seeming disinterest on the part of Dani men and women to engage in sexual relationships during his 1960s fieldwork. Their willing adherence to a four- to five-year post-partum taboo, low birth rates, and low rates of extra-marital sex, were interpreted by Heider as evidence of a general disinterest in heterosexual intercourse.

There is some data to support Heider's hypothesis. As with most other highland New Guinea societies, negative symbolic constructions about women and their reproductive capacities can make sexual intercourse an activity fraught with tension and uncertainty for men. Menstrual blood can poison men's bodies, food, and pigs, according to the Dani, and men consider vaginal sex toxic and potentially debilitating. Metaphors of poison and contagion continue to be employed to strengthen assumptions about male superiority. Women also fear men's bodily substances. Semen, in particular, can poison women's inner organs if it is ingested orally. Semen must never be scattered on the ground, for it can kill plants and poison the earth. A recent survey (Butt et al., 2002) suggested that Dani men and women continue to limit their location and kind of sexual activities in order to protect bodies and gardens from the debilitating effects of bodily fluids.

Another practice that lends support to Heider's argument is that Dani women continue to attempt to space their children so they are born every four to five years. One way they do this is by not having sexual relations with their husband. Parents of a newborn child are expected to refrain from having sex with each other until the woman has stopped breastfeeding, typically around the child's fourth year. Post-partum sexual abstinence is rooted in the conviction that semen is a highly dangerous fluid to an infant, whose body is weak and unfinished. If a couple has sex while the woman breastfeeds, semen can travel up through the woman's internal organs and come out in her breast milk; this can make the child sick or die.

However, other data substantially challenge Heider's claim of Dani "low sexual energy." Peters (1975) describes intense flirting and a high level of sexual knowledge among adolescents. Pre-marital sex was seen as commonplace in the 1960s (Hayward, 1980; Heider, 1976). Courting parties were common, and Hayward (1980) describes couples leaving parties together to spend a night in intimacy. Van der Pavert (1986) describes a ritual that cleanses people if they have engaged in sexual relations with members of their own moiety. Lastly, men say they expect to seek sex elsewhere while their wives are breastfeeding (Butt et al., 2002).

Explanations for low birth rates also challenge Heider's assertion that low rates of sexual relations result in small families. Pontius (1977) suggested that low birth rates were possibly due to tight scrotum strings holding the penis gourd in place, which reduced the transmission of spermatozoa. A further report describes the bark of a cinnamon tree being used as a contraceptive (Kostermans, 1969). Butt (1998; see also Peters, 1975, p. 31) records women obtaining abortions as standard practice.

There is, in sum, little evidence to support Heider's (1976, p. 189) claims of an "extraordinarily low level of sexuality" among the Dani. In a manner similar to most societies, the Dani do have a reasonably systematic set of beliefs about the negative effects of non-reproductive and extra-marital sex. Evidence suggests that stringent efforts were made in the past to regulate sexual practice. However, the Dani live out a complex esthetics of sexuality, based as much on ideas about beauty, desire, and entitlement, as on fears about poison and prohibitions.

## **HEALTH THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE**

#### **Pregnancy and Birth**

A number of Dani ideas about conception and birth draw on observed regularities in bodily growth and development. For conception to occur, the Dani believe that couples have to have sexual intercourse around 10 times. The fetus grows because semen from the man helps build the bones and blood from the woman helps build the flesh. When the fetus moves inside the womb, at approximately 20 weeks, couples abruptly stop having intercourse. Some women describe the fetus as roaming around the mother's body at will, drinking milk from the inside. The fetus is always protected by the placenta, termed *opase* (grandfather, or elder male kin), which looks after the baby in the mother's womb.

Most Dani women decrease food consumption in the final month of pregnancy to prevent their child from being too big at birth. The ideal newborn weight is around 2.5 kg. Women usually give birth alone or with a close relative or experienced assistant. Women like to hold themselves in a standing position, grasping onto the rafters of the cookhouse or the sleeping house roof. Giving birth inside the family compound is essential, as infants are perceived to have so little *etai-egen* that they cannot protect themselves from the spirits that constantly roam the forests and paths. Once the child is born, a relative or the birth assistant wraps the placenta carefully and take it down to the river where it can be disposed of safely. The mother and infant do not leave the site of birth until after the umbilical cord falls off, at around 10 days after giving birth.

#### **Infancy**

Dani women are skilled at transforming small, healthy newborns into large, plump infants. The newborn spends the first 4 months of life in a soft, smooth, and cool netbag. Women surround the infant with soft banana leaves or cloth bedding in the netbag, and carry the infant in the bag slung across their lower backs. The infant comes out of the bag only to change soiled bedding, or partially to breastfeed. Once the mother starts garden work, she takes special care to enclose her baby under 10 or 12 netbags to protect the child from the sun, and from being startled. The baby's vulnerable body, which is "still wet," with "closed eyes" and "soft skin," needs extensive protection from the spirit world (Butt, 1998). Infants grow very fast in these conditions. By 4 months, most babies have more than doubled their birth weight, and at 5 or 6 months almost all infants are plump and healthy.

Infant health deteriorates once mothers begin giving supplementary foods at around 6 or 7 months. Bananas, mashed sweet potatoes, and, increasingly, mashed noodles or crackers, are some of the first foods the baby eats. The protein levels of these foods are adequate, but many infants get sick because they are exposed to bacteria on the spoons that women increasingly use to feed their children. At 7–8 months, many infants experience their first bout of diarrhea. Growth rates slow over the first year, and by the age of 18 months, many children show signs of inadequate nutritional intake.

Infants and young children also suffer from numerous chronic skin problems, including infected insect bites and scabies. Scabies are endemic because many women have begun to use pieces of cloth instead of the more sanitary netbag to hold their babies. Intestinal worms plague significant numbers of young children. However, upperrespiratory infections are the biggest concern (see Figure 1) and many infants who get pneumonia die of it. The death

of a child traumatizes parents, and blame usually falls on ancestor wrath brought about by poorly conducted rituals, or on errant behavior by the mother or the father.

### **Childhood**

Dani childhood is carefree and pleasant. Children roam forests and fields, and do so in age sets distinguished along the lines of gender. Complex gender distinctions between boys and girls come into play as the child achieves more independence at around age 6 or 7. Bodies of boys are seen as more "soft" than those of girls, and as less likely to grow fast and well. Girls, in contrast, grow faster, mature faster, and are seen as hardier than boys. Despite claims to the contrary, the Dani exhibit preferential gender behavior. Boys are more likely to receive formal education than girls. Boys are also more likely to be recipients of medical care than girls. Boys under the age of 5 were taken to clinic one-third more often than girls (Butt, 1998). In ritual situations, boys over the age of 10 or so receive larger pieces of pork than do girls, and they are also fed before girls. Women compensate in part by slipping secret bits of food to their girl children.

#### **Adolescence**

There is little ritual importance attached to the transition from child to adolescent. Only young boys whose fathers are from the *waya* moiety undergo a ritual to be "made *waya*" (Heider, 1972). At this ritual, which occurs during the big pig feast and lasts about two weeks, boys have dangerous *wesa*, or sacred power, drawn from them. They are then purified through a series of rituals that involve some deprivation, hunting, eating ritual taro, and painting a ritual red stripe on their nose (Heider, 1972; Peters, 1975).

For girls, once a young woman has begun to menstruate, in most regions of the valley her clan holds a formal, public rite-of-passage event in which her reproductive capacities are extolled. This ceremony is known as the *hotalimo* (Peters, 1975). The girl cooks sweet potatoes and distributes them, and women dance non-stop to protect the young girl, for "the spirits of the dead want to kill people at moments of crisis, like menstruation or sickness" (Peters, 1975, p. 37). Young women also undergo a skirting ceremony, which usually happens during the big pig feast. Changing a grass skirt to the low-slung thread *yokal* worn by grown women signifies the girl's maturity and

In contrast, the worried mother on the left holds her 2-year-old son, who is little bigger than the other baby. He has suffered from a respiratory infection for several weeks and is mildly malnourished. This was his first trip to the clinic to receive penicillin.

readiness for marriage. The skirting ceremony is still practiced, even though few women now wear the *yokal* skirt on a daily basis.

#### **Adulthood**

At the point where a girl begins to menstruate, she may already be married. Early Indonesian officials and missionaries were horrified to see girls aged 9 or 10 married off during the big pig festival, but they did not realize that the time between public, ritual marriage and consummation of marriage ties is often delayed by several years before the bridegroom's family fully pays off debts to the bride's family (Heider, 1972). Nonetheless, early age at marriage is common, and most young women give birth before the age of 20. This increases the chance of them contracting sexually transmitted diseases early in their reproductive years.

For men, adulthood is achieved later in life, at the time when assiduous attention to social and exchange relations with kin and alliance members begins to pay off.

Both men and women in the present run new health risks. The desire for money and material goods encourages young men to migrate to other parts of the province, in search of the success that cannot easily be attained through traditional routes of leadership. Mobility increases the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases. Wife abuse has increased as couples find themselves far from the regulating relations of village life. Youth regularly drink moonshine (made of bananas or pineapple), illegally imported whisky, and occasionally, distilled rubbing alcohol. Some young men and women in Wamena sniff glue every day.

Commercialized sexual relations are on the increase throughout the province, and in Wamena migrant Indonesian and indigenous women offer sexual services to both Indonesian and indigenous customers. Dani sex workers and their Dani clients are young, with most under the age of 21 (Yasukhogo, 2000). Women from the highlands find themselves at the bottom end of the sex work industry, where health risks are greatest. Dani women offer sexual services in insecure, often dirty, locations. They are poorly paid, at around Rp. 25.000 (U.S. \$2.50) per transaction. Dani women from across the valley have experienced coercive sexual relations with soldiers. Overall, their clients are more likely to be violent, and to refuse to wear condoms. Condom use among indigenous sex workers is almost nil (Butt, 2002).

For many Dani, health is an extension of politics. The use of metaphors of illness and sexuality to explain broader power relations recurs often in Dani political discourse. Many Dani believe that AIDS was deliberately brought in to the province by infected Javanese sex workers in order to render Papuans powerless and enable Indonesian takeover of the valley. Rape of indigenous women by members of the Indonesian military in other parts of the province is also understood as a political tool and contributes to negative Dani assessments of Indonesian rule (Butt, 2001a; Coomaraswamy, 1999; see also Kirsch, 2002). Promoting birth control is also easily understood as part of a broader political effort to control, or eradicate, indigenous Papuans (Butt, 2001b).

#### **Dying and Death**

Dani life expectancy is almost certainly lower than the Indonesian average. Contemporary observations suggest that women and men age rapidly, and often die after they become grandparents. Older people, whose *etai-egens* have become small, often refuse to eat or drink in their final days.

It has been said that the Dani are obsessed with death. The transition from the world of the living to the world of ancestor spirits is a critical time, for spirits are at their most vengeful right after death. The funeral of an important Dani man or woman can last for days. People bring their largest pigs as gifts, which are killed, cooked, and distributed in a highly ritualized fashion. After one to two days of mourning and feasting, the family lifts the corpse high onto a log pyre which has been set on fire. The corpse becomes engulfed in flames. Crying women now all raise their voices in a massive wail and men join in. As the smoke rises into the air and the crying voices cut through the night sky, the message carried to those ancestors, wood spirits, and humans lurking outside the compound is that this dead person has been fully honored, and has no cause to seek revenge after entering the world of ghosts.

Dani health is inextricably linked to broader cycles of life and death. Yet, while groups in other parts of the highlands abandon old ways of life, the Dani retain ritual as core to their ideas about healing. One reason for this might be because development and "Indonesianization" do not appear to have resulted in measurably improved standards of health. Infant mortality remains high, chronic illnesses such as scabies or sexually transmitted diseases have increased, and medical care is inadequate, both in basic quality and in cultural sensitivity (Hartono et al., 1999; Hull & Hartono 1999). For wider political reasons, as well as to protect their cultural strength as a self-interested society, Dani elders continue to insist that health and prosperity can best be achieved not through clinic medicines, but through properly executed rituals, through fecund women and fertile gardens, and through honoring the ancestors and spirits that roam the valley alongside the living.
