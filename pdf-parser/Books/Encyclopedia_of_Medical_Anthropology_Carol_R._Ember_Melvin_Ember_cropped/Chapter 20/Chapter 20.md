# **Homelessness**

#### **Irene Glasser and Rae Bridgman**

The field of anthropology has contributed much to documenting the condition of homelessness, with the goals of easing the lives of those who are homeless, and pointing to ways of preventing and eradicating homelessness. Anthropology's theories, methodologies, and modes of analysis make it especially suited to unearthing the subtleties of homelessness. As one of the most visible indicators of poverty, homelessness confronts communities with their inability to offer everyone the most basic conditions for a healthy and productive life.

## **DEFINITIONS AND THEORIES OF HOMELESSNESS**

A widely used conceptualization of homelessness developed by Peter Rossi (Rossi, Wright, Fisher, & Willis, 1987) distinguishes between the *literally homeless* (persons who obviously have no access to a conventional dwelling and who would be considered homeless by any conceivable definition of the term) and the *precariously or marginally housed* (persons with tenuous or very temporary claims to a more or less conventional dwelling or housing). This distinction can be used in studies of the visibly homeless (those in homeless shelters and living on the streets, in encampments, in abandoned buildings, and in places such as subway stations) and the precariously housed (those doubled-up temporarily with other, usually poor, families, or those paying daily or weekly for inexpensive lodging). How widely one casts the "homeless net" has a tremendous impact on the numbers and characteristics of the people included in the definition of homelessness.

Anthropologists try to use the self-appellation of the group under study. However, there are many individuals without permanent housing who would not necessarily define themselves as "homeless," a term which suggests the stereotype of an elderly man or woman, alone in the streets, with their shopping carts and wearing layers of clothing. In addition, cultures have different words for the concept *homeless*, each with different and sometimes subtle connotations.

Industrialized nations tend to view homelessness as a result of *personal* problems (chronic alcoholism or drug misuse), or as a result of the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill, in concert with the gentrification of urban

#### **Documenting Survival Strategies 171**

housing and decreased government support for social housing and welfare (Glasser, 1994). Developing countries view the etiology of squatter settlements as rural-to-urban migration. In India, for example, the term for people living outside without shelter is *roofless*, a term that does not imply the social pathology so often associated with the word *home-less*. On the other hand, for many years in Finland the word for homeless was *puliukko*, which implies alcoholic.

One way to confront the problem of defining homelessness is to think of homelessness as the opposite of having adequate housing—shelter that is physically adequate and affordable, where people are free from forced eviction, with protection from the elements, potable water in or close to the house, provision for the removal of household and human wastes, site drainage, emergency life-saving services, easy access to health care, and within easy reach of social and economic opportunities (the Limuru Declaration cited in Turner, 1988).

## **METHODOLOGIES FOR THE STUDY OF HOMELESSNESS**

Through undertaking extended fieldwork and using holistic and cross-perspectives, anthropologists attempt to understand what drives individuals to life on the streets and to shelters, and what prevents them from gaining permanent and secure housing.

Ethnography, a hallmark of anthropology, involves entering a culture, learning about it, and, as much as possible, communicating a "native" point of view to a wider public. The "insider's" ethnographic approach attempts to avoid the a priori categories of other disciplines, and therefore enables us to see the world through the eyes of the homeless themselves. Anthropological research on homelessness then becomes a good complement to the research of sociologists, psychologists, and public health professionals who often utilize the one-time interview method.

In order to enter the world of the homeless, it is necessary to develop various approaches to the challenging task of invading the private space of a person whose life is conducted so often in public view. For example, working in a metropolitan airport, Kim Hopper would offer food and coffee to the individuals who slept in the airports and who tried to blend in with the travelers there. He was especially interested in why people preferred the airport to the public shelter and how they managed to survive. Sometimes, for those who were badly disoriented and sick, Hopper would arrange for placements with agencies in the city, but most of the time he concentrated on understanding "the native's point of view" (Hopper, 1991).

A very useful technique that has been employed in homelessness research is *triangulation* or obtaining multiple perspectives about the same person (e.g., interviews complemented by extensive observations). A good example from the work of Koegel (1992) is the self-report of a homeless man on the street who maintained that he used no services, despite living on the street full-time. As a member of the research team tagged along with him one Sunday, they observed him obtaining an entire week's worth of food from a mobile feeding program, which he put in his ice chest (well-camouflaged inside a tattered box), thoroughly belying his claim of "no contact."

## **DOCUMENTING SURVIVAL STRATEGIES**

Perhaps anthropology's greatest contribution to our knowledge of homelessness has been in describing and understanding the methods of adaptation and survival in life on the streets and in the shelters. The thick, ethnographic descriptions of the daily rounds of the homeless have brought the concept of "the street" to life in these studies.

### **Skid Row Studies**

One of the first contemporary examples of homelessness research was the work of Spradley (1970). Utilizing participant observation and methods of linguistic anthropology, Spradley was able to document the broad array of adaptive strategies used by men on the streets of Skid Row in Seattle, Washington. He sought to understand why the men who spent so much time in the "drunk tank" of the local jails, immediately returned to drinking and to the streets upon their release. Twenty years after Spradley, Cohen, and Sokolovsky (1989) turned their attention to the survival strategies of older men on the Bowery. Their study was characterized by more statistical rigor than earlier skid row studies: approximately 10% of the estimated 2,700 men over age 50 living in flophouses, apartments, and on the surrounding streets of the Bowery were sampled during the study period of 1982–83. The methodology of the study involved participant observation, intensive interviewing, and semi-structured questionnaires utilizing previously tested measures of physical, mental, and socioeconomic well-being, as well as measuring the degree of social interaction of older people. They were most impressed by the intense reciprocal sharing of resources among the men on the Bowery. The social and material support the men got from each other served as a buffer to the harsh life on the streets and in the flophouses.

### **Life on the Streets**

Contemporary studies of the life on the streets of homeless people can be said to have begun with the work of Ellen Baxter, a psychologist, and Kim Hopper, an anthropologist (Baxter & Hopper, 1981) in New York City. Although many of the people on the street interviewed in this study appeared to have mental health problems (e.g., talking loudly to themselves, telling the interviewers about imaginary people), Baxter and Hopper pointed out that the daily stresses of life on the street can themselves be mentally exhausting and disorienting. Rather than seeing mental illness as a *cause* of homelessness, Baxter and Hopper see symptoms as the *effect* of life on the streets and in shelters. In fact, the symptoms of mental illness expressed by many homeless (e.g., pacing, rummaging through the garbage, talking to oneself) can be difficult to distinguish from behaviors that may arise as survival adaptations to homelessness. Acting "crazy" may be an effective adaptive strategy for keeping other people at a distance.

Jennifer Wolch, a geographer, and Stacy Rowe, an anthropologist, documented the mobility paths of the homeless in the Los Angeles area as they made their way in search of food, income, social support, and rudimentary shelter (Wolch & Rowe, 1992). Their time–space maps could then be used as a guide about where to position services for the homeless. This research indicates that when the person was not successful in meeting daily needs for food, shelter, and camaraderie, long-term goals were often sacrificed.

### **Panhandling**

A common method of survival on the street is panhandling, or begging for money. There are few anthropological studies on begging, which is perhaps surprising given the attention of anthropologists to life on the streets. An early and excellent study of begging in Chiapas, Mexico, was conducted by Horacio Fabrega, a psychiatrist and anthropologist (Fabrega, 1971).

Fabrega studied the phenomenon of begging in San Cristóbal by means of participant observation, interviews, gathering life histories, and, in some cases, performing medical evaluations on over 80 beggars. There appeared to be a relationship between a person's physical disability and his characteristic manner of asking for alms. The people with obvious physical disabilities needed only to sit or stand next to the doorway of a church, with hand extended or a plate next to them. Those without an obvious disability had to do more to convince a potential donor of their need for charity.

Twenty-five years after the San Cristóbal study, Williams (1995) sought to observe begging in two U.S. cities, New York and Tucson, Arizona. Her mission was not to conduct a systematic study, but rather to become a more informed "fellow citizen" in a society where panhandling is no longer confined to skid row. Williams described three types of beggars: the "character beggars" who impressed listeners with their stories and personalities; the "brother-can-you-spare-a-dime" beggars, whose interactions with fellow urbanites were brief and whose stories were minimal; and the "will-work-for-food beggars." As in Fabrega's observations, beggars underlined their lack of any alternatives, had an obvious disability (though not necessarily a permanent one), and invoked God in their expression of gratitude.

### **Getting Food**

By the 1980s, soup kitchens and food banks, once called "emergency" feeding programs, had dropped the word emergency from their titles and become a part of the contemporary landscape in North America. Soup kitchens, serving a hot noontime meal or evening dinner, and sometimes serving breakfast as well, have come to be relied upon by people who live on the streets and in shelters (shelters typically do not serve meals during the day).

Soup kitchens and food banks have become so institutionalized that levels of government now depend on them to supplement meager social assistance, people in need of doing community service and charity work depend upon their existence to fulfill their commitments, and poor people (most of whom are *not* homeless) depend on them for a hot meal and food supplies. Glasser (1988) described a soup kitchen that served a daily hot meal to

#### **Documenting Survival Strategies 173**

over 100 "guests" (as soup kitchen clients are typically called) each day in a "no-questions-asked" setting. With very few staff members and many hours of operation during which guests could drink coffee, smoke cigarettes, and socialize, this was a setting in which poor people created their own set of rules and ambiance, and help in times of crisis.

Working in food banks and soup kitchens in Delaware, Curtis (1996) noted that some food policies and programs directed at the poor originated not because of the nutritional needs of the poor, but out of a quest to find nonmarket outlets for surplus agricultural products, in order to sustain farm prices and incomes. Therefore, if one wants to understand how the homeless meet their needs for sustenance by studying the feeding programs of shelters, soup kitchens, and food banks, it is useful to look not only at what is happening in the dining room from the recipients' point of view—but also, as Curtis pointed out, at the total context of the feeding program and how it is delivered.

### **Squatting**

In the developing world, millions of people live in squatter settlements, which are self-made housing units, often at the edge of a city, inhabited by poor people who have "invaded" the land, often at night, and built structures. From the *pueblos jóvenes* (young towns) of Lima, Peru, to the *bidonvilles* (tin cities) of Africa, these examples of self-help are seen as incipient communities that could, with the assistance of clean water, security of tenure, and some basic services, become stable communities of productive citizens (see Turner, 1976, for a full discussion of the potential of squatter settlements). In the industrialized world, squatting usually refers to homeless people taking over a vacant building or creating an encampment on a vacant lot.

### **Shelter Life**

When anthropologists have focused their attention on shelter living, they have, for the most part, been struck by the corrosive effects of shelter life on the homeless person. Desjarlais (1997) spent time in a mid-size (52 beds) shelter for the homeless mentally ill. Although the staff regarded the shelter as the "Rolls Royce" of shelters, the place was in fact noisy and distracting. The clients just *struggling along*, as they put it, can be seen as a shelter-induced adaptation, and may not be due primarily to the mental illness suffered by most of the residents. According to Desjarlais, struggling along contrasts to *experiencing* life, which implies active engagement with the world, including the ability to perceive, reflect, and act. Residents of the shelter spent much of the day pacing, bumming and smoking cigarettes, and drinking coffee.

The description is reminiscent of Murray's (1984) contrast between linear time, where people make longterm plans, and cyclical time, associated with survival goals. Life on the streets is often associated with immediate, daily, weekly, and monthly cycles of time: the hours of opening and closing of the soup kitchens and shelters, the weekly appointments with social workers and doctors, and monthly check days.

In a study of a large (600 beds) New York City shelter (Franklin Avenue shelter in the South Bronx), Gounis (1992) hypothesized that the institutionalized atmosphere of the shelter eventually resulted in the *shelterization* or dependency of the occupants. For example, rules governing time and space kept the men on the move (to leave during the day, to be in by early afternoon) or kept them waiting in line (e.g., the ubiquitous lines for food, the shower, seeing the caseworker). The men were not allowed to sleep in a bed or on the floor during the day and so resorted to sleeping on top of pool tables and ping-pong tables, a sight reminiscent of the large mental hospitals before the era of deinstitutionalization.

Observers of shelter life have noticed the great variability among shelters. Liebow (1993), in a richly descriptive ethnographic account of his 10 years of participant observation in two women's shelters in the Washington, DC, area, notes major differences. One shelter, he calls "The Refuge," was staffed mostly by volunteers, and was housed in the fellowship hall of a church. It was a "low-demand" (for the shelter users) albeit bare-bones shelter. Liebow found that women appeared to be comfortable there, despite the physical limitations of the space. On the other hand, "The Bridge" was conceptualized as a therapeutic house, providing shelter for women, but with the understanding that the women would be actively working on a case plan to return to permanent housing. The staff were paid and well educated, and, according to Liebow's observations, were more burned out than the volunteer staff of "The Refuge." The book, *Tell Them Who I Am*, was written in part in collaboration with the homeless women and staff of the two shelters, who read and commented on the

manuscript. Liebow prints this commentary on his insights in footnotes which occur throughout the book. His is one of the few works in contemporary anthropology which takes the idea of collaboration with the community under study seriously and literally.

### **Doubling-Up**

Probably the least researched type of adaptation to homelessness is that of living with another family, usually another poor family, on a very temporary basis. This is referred to as "doubling-up" and is often a precursor to life on the streets, or in encampments and shelters.

In Janet Fitchen's pioneering work on rural homelessness in New York state (Fitchen, 1991), she found that the most frequent form of lack of adequate shelter among the rural poor was to squeeze two families into a trailer or apartment that was already too small for one. These arrangements were often short-lived, as the strain of the situation made life unbearable. Fitchen found that doubling-up was associated not with mental illness or substance abuse, but a worsening economy in rural areas due in part to the great loss of manufacturing jobs. Another factor that led to doubling-up was the rise of single motherhood in which income (through work or welfare) was not adequate to pay rent.

If a realistic portrayal of homelessness is to be achieved, it is incumbent upon the researcher to capture the *dynamic* quality of life on the streets as people cycle through the various alternative places to sleep (the street, shelters, hotels, and rehabilitation programs). For example, interview someone after a long hotel stay and they may discuss the loneliness and danger of their life. Interview the same person after a stint in a rehabilitation program (e.g., detoxification, or alcohol, or drug treatment), and they may bitterly complain about the regimentation and lack of privacy. It is important to know where in the cycle we are meeting the person (Koegel, 1992). Cycles of living on the streets may be seasonal, as has been observed among some groups of aboriginal people in Canadian cities who spend several months living on the streets, interspersed with several months "up North" on a reserve.

## **HEALTH AND HOMELESSNESS**

The health problems experienced by homeless people may be conceptualized as those contributing to the etiology of homelessness; those arising as a direct consequence of homelessness; and those conditions exacerbated by homelessness. From a large U.S. study of homelessness and health (Institute of Medicine, 1988), conditions that contributed significantly to a person's inability to work mental illness, AIDS, and injuries—may be seen as resulting in homelessness for those without other means of support. Other conditions (e.g., skin disorders, trauma, malnutrition, and parasitic diseases) increase and are exacerbated, or even actually caused by homelessness. Also, homelessness makes the treatment of diseases much more complicated. For example, prescribing bed rest or a special diet is impossible for individuals living in most shelters or for people relying on soup kitchens for their meals.

### **Physical Health**

In a study of men using homeless shelters in Toronto, homeless men's mortality rate was 8.3 times the mortality rate of the general male population in the same city in the 18–24 year old age group, 3.7 in the 25–44 year old group, and 2.3 times the 45–64 year old group (Hwang, 2000). The rates of traumatic disorders, skin and blood vessel disorders, respiratory diseases, and chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are higher in the homeless population than in the general population (Institute for Medicine, 1988). Of great concern are homeless individuals with infectious tuberculosis who sleep in crowded shelters and are not able to adhere to their medication regimen.

### **Mental Illness**

For many people in North America the issue of homelessness is closely tied to the phenomenon of *deinstitutionalization*, which refers to the process of having people who were hospitalized with psychiatric problems leave the hospital in order to live in the community. In the United States and Canada, the movement away from long-term hospital stays in favor of short-term, crisisoriented hospitalizations and then community placements occurred in force during the 1960s and 1970s. Life in the community was considered more humane than life in the large psychiatric institutions. However, approximately 10 years after the community placements began, there appeared to be a visible segment of former patients

#### **Ending Homelessness 175**

wandering the streets and generally not being cared for by "the community." The early placements in group homes, boarding houses, and apartments fell into disarray (or were tenuous at best in the first place). The former patients wandered away from the placements, and many stopped taking their medications. How many of the homeless population really are mentally ill became an object of great interest in the research community and in the general public during this time period.

When rates of mental illness among the homeless are contrasted with rates in the general population, we find that most studies with good methodology report that 20–50% of the homeless population in the United States suffer from severe mental illness (i.e., schizophrenia, major affective disorders, paranoia and other psychoses, and personality disorders) in contrast to 1% in the general population (Burt, 1992, pp. 108–109). Although much attention has been given to the effect of the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill on rates of homelessness, researchers were reporting a 20% rate of severe mental illness among skid row residents even in the 1950s, before the era of returning the hospitalized mentally ill to the community (Burt, 1992, p. 109).

### **Substance Abuse**

The relationship of alcohol and drug use to homelessness is interactive, in that it is very difficult for an individual with limited financial resources to remain in housing when much of his/her money is spent on substances, and it is difficult for an individual to focus on substance abuse treatment when his/her basic survival needs for shelter, food, and warmth are only precariously met. A recurring question is whether substance use disorders precede homelessness or are precipitated by it (Glasser & Zywiak, 2003).

There is substantial evidence that alcoholism is the most pervasive health problem of the homeless in the United States (Fischer & Breakey, 1991). The rate of alcohol abuse has been estimated to be 58–68% for homeless men; 30% for homeless single women; and 10% for mothers in homeless families. In the general population, the rates for alcohol abuse are estimated to be 10% for men and between 3% and 5% for women.

Determining the rate of drug use among the homeless has been especially fraught with problems, since many studies do not distinguish between drug and alcohol use or between occasional use and a regular drug habit. An estimated rate of between 25% and 50% of the homeless population use illicit drugs, and this exceeds the rate of the general population in the United States. Intravenous drug use is one of the primary transmitters of the HIV virus.

In their study of homeless youth in Hollywood, California, Robertson, Koegel, and Ferguson (1989) found that almost half (48.4%) of their respondents could be diagnosed as being either alcohol users or being alcohol dependent at some point in their lives, and that even the nonabusers drank and were at high risk of becoming problem drinkers. The authors found that being on the street exacerbated the amount of drinking. Interestingly, very few of the total sample (6.5%) said that their drinking was a contributing factor to their homelessness, although almost one quarter (23.7%) said that alcoholrelated problems (including alcohol-induced violence) had led to their leaving home. Very few of the youth had had any kind of alcohol treatment.

In an excellent study examining the *overlap* of mental health and substance abuse problems among the homeless, 1,260 shelter residents in New York City were surveyed (Struening & Padgett, 1990). How, the researchers asked, is health status related to the individual's involvement with alcohol, drugs, mental disorder, and a combination of all three? It is not surprising that the coexistence of heavy substance use with symptoms (or a history) of mental disorder resulted in very high rates of poor health, disability, and worsening health conditions. The often-cited health problems were hypertension, stomach and liver problems, and respiratory disease. The implication of this study is again that medical and mental health care (including substance-abuse treatment) need to be integrated with services for the homeless. Especially important is early and effective intervention with substance abusers in order to circumvent a lifetime of health consequences of alcohol and/or drug abuse.

Beyond the epidemiology of substance use among the alcohol- and drug-using homeless population, advocates for the homeless argue that providing housing is a first step in rehabilitation. Given the episodic nature of much of the homelessness of the population, it is also important to consider providing adequate support to individuals during their *housed* periods.

## **ENDING HOMELESSNESS**

What do we know about ending homelessness? If many of the homeless shelters in North America have not been effective in leading people to permanent housing, then what programs and strategies have proven helpful? How has the voluminous research on the cultures of the homeless been translated into action that leads to secure housing? We review here only a few of the exemplary programs that address homelessness. (For a full review, including other strategies such as outreach, self-help housing and advocacy on behalf of homeless communities, see Glasser & Bridgman, 1999.)

### **Daytime Respites**

While on the street, there is an intermediate step of service between outreach efforts and permanent shelter which may be termed a "daytime respite," or a place of rest and refuge for the homeless person. One successful daytime respite is Chez Doris, a multilingual (French, English, and, increasingly, Inuktitut, the language of the Inuit) daytime shelter for women in Montreal. The center was named after Doris, a destitute young woman murdered on the street in 1974. Chez Doris is the gathering spot for over 60 women a day; they come for food, clothing, baths, laundry facilities and, most of all, the companionship of the other women and the staff. The center is funded by a combination of government and private donations, and the women who utilize Chez Doris also provide much of the labor needed to run the place. It is a "low demand, no-questions-asked" service that accepts women who are poor, on the street, and may have psychiatric and/or substance-abuse problems.

### **Utilizing Indigenous Leadership**

There are many examples of leadership and social support among the homeless, whether they are in encampments, single-room-occupancy hotels, or shelters. These examples can prefigure projects that seek to provide permanent and safe housing for the homeless.

Shapiro (1969) documented the dominant leaders within three different single-room-occupancy hotels. All three were women who were able to provide emotional and material aid to the other hotel residents. They were also able to be a link to the professionals who came to the hotel to provide health and social services. Almost 20 years later, Glasser (1988) documented the social networks and leadership exhibited within the dining room of a soup kitchen. The leaders among the soup kitchen guests were seen as *more* effective at sharing information and making referrals than were the staff. A program that taught accurate information about community resources to groups of soup-kitchen leaders, who were chosen from the various social networks within the dining room, appeared to be effective in increasing the fund of knowl-

### **Transitional and Supportive Housing**

edge of these leaders.

Many people are not able to make the transition from shelter to apartment living. They require support in order to maintain permanent housing. Transitional housing generally consists of housing with two years of services, while supportive housing offers services for an openended period of time. Such housing may be provided within one physical space (e.g., apartment units built in former warehouses), or it may be provided in scattered apartments in publicly or privately owned buildings, with services brought in to individuals or families. In many communities, transitional and supportive housing is much preferred over building more shelters, which are often viewed with fear and suspicion. Increasingly, it is also being recognized that transitional and supportive housing models offer far more economical options than emergency shelters or institutions such as psychiatric hospitals or detention centers.

The Native Women's Transition Centre (opened in 1981) in Winnipeg, Manitoba, for example, provides longterm residential services for aboriginal women experiencing family violence, abuse, addiction, involvement with Child and Family Services, and inadequate housing (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, 1999, pp. 45–55). This long-term residential facility is staffed 24 hours a day, and provides a safe home for native women and their children. Staff are all aboriginal women. There are ex-residents among the full- and part-time staff, and on the Board of Directors. The program respects traditional native practices with a healing circle as an integral part of its program and a healing room built to resemble a teepee. Generally the maximum length of stay is one year. Then residents may choose to move on to second-stage housing at Memengwaa Place ("Home of the Butterfly").

## **CONCLUSION**

Anthropologists have been able to offer the "thick" description of homeless communities that are so often

#### **References 177**

missing from more statistical approaches, and have helped us comprehend the pathways into and out of homelessness. Anthropology's holistic approach of integrating the large, macro-level societal movements, as well as the family and personal level dynamics, offers a complex understanding. Some of the most compelling work in the field utilizes an understanding of the culture that is created by the homeless themselves in order to create employment, housing, health and social service programs, and policies that are culturally compatible with the world views of homeless people.
