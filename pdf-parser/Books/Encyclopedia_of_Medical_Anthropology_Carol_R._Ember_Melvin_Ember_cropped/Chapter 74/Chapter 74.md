## **ALTERNATIVE NAMES**

Chinese, *Zhongguo-ren, Han-ren, Hua-ren, Tang-ren*. Because of their predominant numbers in China, the Han are commonly referred to as Chinese in the English language, though in China (including Taiwan) they have always called themselves "*Han-ren*" (Han people). Outside China they tend to call themselves "Chinese" (*Zhongguo-ren*) and many overseas Han Chinese also use their provincial names or other local origins in China (such as Guangdong, Fujian, Hakha, Taishan, etc.) to refer to themselves since their Han identity is virtually unknown outside China.

The name "Han" was derived from the Han River, an upper tributary of the Yangtze River. It was further strengthened by the famous Han Empire (206 BC–220 AD) which lasted for several hundred years when the people began active interactions with the outside world. It is understood the Han are the result of amalgamation of numerous ancient ethnic groups.

While the term "*Han-ren*" is used in China to differentiate the Han from other ethnic groups, "*Hua-ren*" now mostly refers to Overseas Chinese, such as *Mei-ji Hua-ren* (American Chinese), *Yindunixiya Huaren* (Indonesian Chinese), etc. "*Hua*" is an ancient name for China, and it is still used when referring to China in combination with the word "*Zhong*" (middle), such as *Zhong Hua Ren Min Gong He Guo* (People's Republic of China) and *Zhong Hua Min Guo* (Republic of China). Chinatowns in other countries are referred to as *Tang-renjie*, meaning "Town of the Tang People." *Tang* refers to the ancient Tang dynasty (618–907) in China.

# **LOCATION AND LINGUISTIC AFFILIATION**

The Han are the majority ethnic group in China in East Asia, accounting for 91.59% of the whole Chinese population. The Han language (*Han Yu*), outside China known as "Chinese," belongs to the Tibetan-Han Language Family. It consists of seven major dialects, namely the Northern dialect, the Wu dialect, the Xiang dialect, the Gan dialect, the Hahka dialect, the Min dialect, and the Yue dialect. The modern common speech ( *pu-tong-hua*) is based upon the Northern dialect with Beijing pronunciation.

These dialects are mutually intelligible in most cases, especially between the Northern dialect and others. However, since 221 BC, there has been an unified idiographic (actually it is an idiographic script with phonetic elements) script which has survived the long history of China and which has been one of the most important factors in holding the people and the country together.

## **OVERVIEW OF CULTURE**

The population of Han in China mainland was 1,167 million, and about 22 million in Taiwan in 2000. As of 1999, the Han Overseas Chinese population was about 35 million (about 27 million in other Asian countries; 6 million in the Americas; and about 1 million in Europe).

Confucianism, which made its appearance between the 6th and 5th century BC began its glorious era during the Han Dynasty not too long after the First Emperor's ruthless persecution of Confucian scholars. While Daoism shaped the accepting and yielding, joyful, and carefree side of the Han character, Confucianism molded the Han people with a moral and duty-conscious, austere, and purposeful group mentality. As a set of social ethics governing interpersonal relations, Confucianism is largely responsible for the secular nature of Han social thought. Its social philosophy advocates filial piety in the family and benevolence in the administration of the government. Confucianism virtually played the role of a state religion together with ancestor worship, and has been a strong binding force that has kept Chinese society a super stable agrarian one in spite of more than two thousand years of dynastic changes.

In Confucianism an ideal society is a peaceful and harmonious one in which everyone plays by the rules and everyone loves the other. It is the enlargement of the family model in which responsibilities and obligations to the group reign supreme and personal freedom and individual rights are unheard of.

The Han family is patriarchal, patrilineal, and patrilocal in nature. The key link that binds everyone together in the family is *xiao*, filial piety. It means obligations of descendants to their progenitors, especially one's father and mother. The family is an unending chronic continuum linking the dead, the living, and the unborn. The principles underlying the kinship system are lineage, generation, sex, and seniority, and the most important relationship in the family is between the father and the son (Hsu, 1948). In this closely-knit network everyone is taken care of and nobody is left alone. The family clan may exert enormous influence over individual families and their members.

Extensive use of kinship terms outside the family and family clan, and even with strangers is a strong indication that among the Han the ideal society is one constructed on the family model.

While Confucianism provides the guidelines for interpersonal relations in this world, ancestor worship provides the solution for the next. As a religion Daoism plays an auxiliary role. Mahayana Buddhism which originated in India also has considerable influence. Christianity, both Roman Catholic and Protestant, is present and the followers are a small minority.

# **THE CONTEXT OF HEALTH: ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL FACTORS**

### **Environment and Population Distribution**

The Han people live mainly in the most developed agricultural regions and large metropolitan areas in the Song-Liao plain, drainage areas of the Yellow River, Huai River, Yangtze River and the Pearl River, and in Taiwan. Most of the areas where the Han live belong to temperate and subtropical zones with four distinct seasons. The north has a long winter when things are covered with ice and snow. The south is warmer and has more rain. 36.09% of the population live in urban areas and 63.91% in rural areas. Illiteracy and semi-illiteracy rate was 6.72% (2000).

### **Sedentary Agriculture in History and Recent Industrial Development**

The Han people have practiced sedentary agriculture for thousands of years and developed sophisticated irrigation systems that played an important role in the economy. While in the north one crop is raised, in the south two crops are planted. As majority of the population live in the countryside and practice agriculture, most of the activities have evolved according to a lunar calendar, that is agricultural routine. But recent changes have accelerated the country's industrial development. Now China ranks seventh in the world in GDP following the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Great Britain, and Italy. The way of life is changing fast.

#### **Diet and Nutrition**

Han diets vary with geographic location. The main staple foods in the north are wheat, corn, and millet and in the south rice and sweet potatoes. Vegetables form an important part of the Han diet. In the south, fresh vegetables are available all year round, while in the north, preserved cabbage, potatoes, and radishes are mostly relied on. With economic development, northern areas have more fresh vegetables in the winter. Red meats, poultry and fish are also important, but in the past they were consumed by the common people only during major festivals or on the occasions of entertaining guests. A Han meal is divided into two parts: *fan* and *cai. Fan* includes food grains and potatoes, and *cai* may consist of vegetables, meats, poultry, fish, and pickles. Dofu (soybean curd) made of soy is a popular food item which provides good nutrition and is a major protein source.

According to a 1990s survey, an average of 66.8% of dietary energy originated from cereals, 57.4% for urban residents and 71.7% for rural people. The proportion of protein coming from cereals was 50–60%, beans 5–6%, and from animals 20–30%; dietary fat provides 22% of energy intake (Ge, 1996).

As there is no clear demarcation between food and herbal medicine, Han people often mixed food with herbs and call them "Yaoshan" (medicinal foods). Herbs used are either tonic or are effective cures for some health problems.

Han people generally do not drink milk and dairy products were not very common, though milk and milk products are on the increase. Many of them do not have the tolerance for milk. Protein is obtained mainly from soy products like tofu and soy milk.

With the new economic policy and affluence, McDonalds, Hamburgers, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, etc., have made their way into the Chinese cities and are quickly becoming favorites of the children. Some nutritionists are critical of the new changes and predict serious health consequences.

#### **The Context of Health 705**

Nutrition has improved substantially since the turn of the century. According to *The Dietary and Nutritional Status of Chinese Population, 1992 National Nutrition Survey*, average energy intake per person per day was 2,328 kcal, accounting for 97.1% (99.8% for urban residents and 95.7% for rural) of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA). This shows adequate food has been consumed and hunger is no longer a problem. However, there are still serious problems with regard to nutrition.

Average protein intake was 68 g, accounting for 90.3% of the RDA. The intake of nicotinic acid (15.7 mg) and ascorbic acid (100.2 mg) was adequate, the intake of thiamine (1.2 mg) was fair, and that of retinal equivalent (Vitamin A, 156.5 mg) and riboflavin (vitamin B2, 0.8 mg) was low.

Deficiency of calcium is rather common, and the intake (405.4 mg) accounted for only 50% of the RDA. As a result rickets is relatively common among children. The high incidence of osteoporosis among elderly women is also related to calcium inadequacy.

The apparent iron intake (23.4 mg) is adequate. However, iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are the most common nutritional deficiency problems, particularly among women and children. This is due to poor absorption of iron from plant food and specialists suggest enriching food with iron (Ge, 1992). In 1998, more than 50,000 people were found to suffer from Keshan disease due to lack of selenium, more than 1 million had Keschin Beck disease, while more than 9 million had diseases related to lack of iodine (China Yearbook of Health, 2000).

According to another report, inadequacy of zinc among children and early youth, and of iron among women is worrisome. Fifteen thousand people die every day (70% of total deaths) due to chronic diseases caused by malnutrition and nutrition imbalance, 21.6 million children are below their normal body weight, and 42 million children suffer retarded growth (China News Service, 2002).

#### **Major Diseases**

The ten leading causes of death in rural areas in order of incidence are; (1) respiratory disease, (2) malignant tumors, (3) cerebral vascular disease, (4) heart disease, (5) traumatic injuries and toxicosis, (6) digestive diseases, (7) urinary and reproductive diseases, (8) new born baby diseases, (9) TB, and (10) endocrine, nutritional, metabolic and immune diseases. In metropolitan areas they are (1) malignant tumors, (2) cerebral vascular disease, (3) heart disease, (4) respiratory disease, (5) traumatic injuries and toxicosis, (6) digestive diseases, (7) endocrine, nutritional, metabolic and immune diseases, (8) urinary and reproductive diseases, (9) mental disease, and (10) neuropathy. Malignant tumors have risen 69% for the last 20 years. Specialists attribute this to more intake of red meats and heavy use of tobacco. China now has 3 million smokers. Environmental pollution is the third major factor contributing to increased rate of cancer (New China News Service, 2001).

Leading infectious diseases are viral hepatitis (incidence rate per 100,000 is 68.93), dysentery (45.91), gonorrhea (20.63), and newborn baby tetanus (16.55).

Since the Han people use nightsoil for crops, fecalborne diseases are very common. Typhoid fever, dysentery and cholera were once causing the highest mortality in rural areas (Simoons, 1991). Parasitic infections and other major health hazard diseases that used to be prevalent have been put under control after the 1950s. In 1999, out of 1919 rural counties, 409 found snail fever (schistosomiasis) infecting 366,784 people (China Yearbook of Health, 2000).

Venereal diseases that were once rampant in the country were almost eliminated after the 1950s. But following the opening up and reforms that began in 1970s and the issuing economic development, they have come back at an alarming rate.

AIDS has become an urgent issue in recent years. According to UNAID, an agency of the United Nations, estimated persons infected with HIV might be as high as 1.5 million at the end of 2001. Chinese official reports estimated the figure of HIV carriers at one million during the first half of 2002, a 16.7% increase over 2001 (China Daily, October 16, 2002). Predictions are, that if no effective measures are taken, AIDS cases may reach 10 million before the year 2010. Drug use, illegal blood transfusion practices, and unsafe sex are the main problems. In a culture where the talk of sex is almost a taboo, dissemination of the right information concerning AIDS is very difficult.

According to an official report, in 1999 0.054% of the total population were drug addicts, which means that about 681,000 people were drug users. Of the drug addicts, those taking heroin made up 71.5%, and those under the age of 35 were 79.2% (CPIRC). The suicide rate is rising, especially among rural women. According to an official report 250,000 people commit suicide every year and the rate is 22 per ten thousand. Women are three times more likely to commit suicide when faced with unsolved problems, and suicide has become the leading cause of death among people between 15–34 years of age (People's Daily Online, 2002).

#### **Alcohol and Tobacco Use**

Drinking strong liquor brewed from rice and other food grains is viewed as entertainment. There is no legal age for drinking; some may begin to drink from childhood. However, alcoholism is not a serious threat. People begin to smoke very early in life. No legal age limit is set and almost everyone smokes in the countryside. To offer a cigarette is considered a very friendly gesture few can decline. This is one of the reasons why respiratory diseases are so common.

#### **Infrastructure**

Among the Han people there are two medical systems, namely biomedicine that they call "Western medicine," and traditional medicine which they call "Chinese medicine" (*Zhong Yao*). In both Japan and Korea, Chinese medicine is called the "Han medicine." For clarity this article will use the terms "Western medicine" and "Chinese medicine." Though Western medicine came to China during the early 20th century, it has never been able to replace Chinese medicine which has long become part of daily life.

Today Chinese medicine and Western medicine enjoy equal status. All medical doctors must be trained in both Chinese medicine and Western medicine although they may have either as their major area of training. All hospitals provide both services and when a patient comes to see a doctor, he or she may have a choice with the help of the doctor.

Health care in China was notorious before the 1950s. Steady progress has been made in public health since then. At the end of 2000, there were 325,000 health institutions (including clinics) throughout the country, with a total of 3.18 million beds, 2.21 million of which were in hospitals and public health centers. There were 4.49 million health workers, including 2.08 million doctors and 1.27 million senior and junior nurses (China Yearbook of Health, 2000).

By mid-1960s, an effective healthcare network was established and the whole population was provided with basic preventive and curative health care. Strict control by the government on drug production and sales ensured low prices for quality drugs. Since early 1980s however, things have changed drastically. Market oriented reforms brought about an economic boom in the country, but at the same time, medical costs have risen sharply as public health sector is put to the mercy of profit-making markets. Corruption is rampant in the country; some reports reveal that many doctors are on commissions from drug suppliers. Major operations cost dearly. In addition, families of patients who need surgery give to the surgeons and other personnel they consider important good amounts of money and expensive gifts called "red envelopes" (*hongbao*).

While higher medical costs do not affect urban residents too much because they are mostly covered by medical insurance and special aid, higher costs have caused enormous difficulties for rural populations. The three-tier (county, town, village) health network that covered most of China's rural area with active participation from what were called "barefoot doctors" is no longer effective because of lack of public funding, privatization of village clinics, and profiteering of medical institutions. A 1998 survey conducted by the Ministry of Health revealed that due to financial difficulties, about 36% of sick farmers did not seek medical treatment and 61% of inpatients had to leave the hospital halfway through getting proper care. The fact that only one fifth of government total public health spending in the late 1990s went to rural areas, where more than 70% of the total population live, has caused controversy among government circles (Zhu, 2002.)

Some pilot programs with village-level public clinics which pool funds from villages, local government, and businesses are underway and collective medical insurance or social medical insurance systems are being tried, but the results are yet to be seen.

Status of Chinese medicine is very different among Overseas Chinese (Han). In some countries, they are still using it in their health care. In the United States and Western Europe, stringent policies against traditional practices favor biomedicine. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) and the issuing policy by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration created another category that is neither regular food nor drug: dietary supplements. Since Chinese medicine is not recognized as medicine, many Chinese medicinal patent formulas came to the U.S. under this category.

Some methods of treatment in Chinese medicine may be considered abusive by Westerners outside the culture. Skin-scraping, a procedure of scraping the surface

of the body until it is purple (near bleeding), and even acupuncture and moxibustion occasionally cause legal problems.

## **MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS**

### **Four Thousand Years of Unbroken Tradition**

The beginning of Chinese medicine was lost in antiquity. Legend of the Han attributed it to Shennong, "The Divine Peasant," one of the earliest emperors who was said to have tasted hundreds of herbs. Later *Shennong Ben Cao Jing* (Shennong's Herbal) was compiled in his name. It is perhaps the worlds first pharmacopoeia. Thereafter the investigation of herbal medicine has never been interrupted. A great amount of information has been recorded. Methods of preparing herbal formulas have been successfully refined, and the number and variety of clinical applications of herbal medicine have grown in proportion (Hsu, 1986).

In the 3rd century BC, *Huangdi Nei Jing* (*The Yellow Emperor's Classics of Internal Medicine*) was compiled showing how advanced practical medical knowledge was at that time. Many of the formulas described in it are still being used today. Hua Tuo, a historically famous medical specialist in the beginning of the 3rd century, was able to perform major surgery including opening the stomach cavity and repairing the intestines, under anesthesia.

As a tradition, Chinese medicine is shaped by the influence of Confucianism in many ways. Its secular nature came from the Confucian attitude "to respect gods and ghosts but hold them at a distance." In history, many Confucian scholars were also famous doctors, and their strong sense of history and responsibility to society made them instrumental in making the medical system a strong and unbroken tradition (Li, 1990). Landmark medical writings including materia medica and treatment experiences are countless including such works as Zhang Zhongjing's *Shang Han Lun* (*Discussion of Cold Diseases*, about 200 BC), Sun Shimiao's *Invaluable Prescriptions for Ready Reference* (652 AD), Li Shizhen's *A Compendium of Materia Medica* of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), *A Grand Dictionary of Chinese Medicine* (1979), *Encyclopedia Sinica, Volume of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Zhongguo Dabaike Quanshu Zhongyi* 2000*)* and the *China Pharmacopoeia (2001)*.

#### **Shamanism**

Shamanism may have been practiced since the beginning of the Han civilization. The famous bone-shell script that evolved into the present Han writing (Chinese script) and was used to predict the future may also have been used to diagnose diseases. Since people also believed in supernatural causes of diseases, including gods, spirits of both dead people (ancestor or dead relatives) and some mysterious animals such as the fox and weasels, shamans were much needed to solve the problems acting as a go-between or a messenger between these supernatural beings and the human world. These shamans played an important relieving role in the countryside. Even during the time after 1949 when the Chinese government waged extensive campaigns against superstition and religion, shamanism has never disappeared entirely. With softening of the policy toward traditional beliefs, shamanism seems to have come back to the countryside especially in economically poor areas and remote regions.

#### **Religious Personnel**

In cosmology, disease and destiny (in the Chinese language destiny and life share the same word) are closely connected. Therefore it is understandable that religious personnel played a part in Chinese medicine. Most of the Daoist (Taoist) priests and Buddhist monks had very good knowledge of traditional medicine and used them in their congregations. People also looked to these religious premises for ultimate cures, especially in case of tenacious diseases or in case of barrenness.

### **Traditional Herbal Practitioners**

Chinese medicine as a strong empirical tradition has always kept its secular nature, and to diagnose, treat, and cure diseases has always been an important profession. Some of these professionals people call "doctors" were full time herbalists while others, depending upon the circumstances in the community, might be part time practitioners and part time peasants.

Doctors of Chinese medicine were trained mainly in master–apprentice relationships. More often than not this master–apprentice relationship was just between the father and son. The founding of the People's Republic of China brought about many changes in medical practice. Chinese medicine is officially recognized and enjoys the same status as Western medicine. Training of doctors of Chinese medicine became formalized and institutionalized and research institutions have been set up with the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine as the nation's highest authority. Universities and colleges have been set up to train traditional doctors and other specialists. They major in Chinese medicine, but at the same time they must have basic training in Western medicine as well. After graduation they would work in metropolitan hospitals or rural clinics. While they mainly use herbs to treat and cure, they also can legally use Western medicine, integrating the two systems as they see fit. Patients would also have a choice to elect for either Western drugs or herb formulas.

#### **View of Western Medicine**

Doctors in Chinese medicine tend to be more personable than their counterparts in Western medicine due to their training. They inquire into many aspects of the patients' way of life and tend to form closer interpersonal relationships with the patients and their families.

Many Han people feel that Western medicine is particularistic and analytic, and focuses on the ailing part of the body, "seeing only trees, but not the forest." On the other hand, Chinese medicine, though slow in efficacy, tackles the root cause of the diseases. So people would tend to go to a western medical doctor when the illness is acute, and go to a doctor of Chinese medicine when it is not.

Since the 50s, a process of integration took place in China and combination of the two systems has shown promising results. A popular statement in this connection is that 112, and the experience has enriched both Western medicine and Chinese medicine.

# **CLASSIFICATION OF ILLNESS, THEORIES OF ILLNESS, AND TREATMENT OF ILLNESS**

### **Theories of the Universe and of the Human Body**

**The Universe and Nature.** The "Universe" or "Cosmos", as expressed in Han language, is *Yu Zhou*, designating space and time. "*Yu*" is the collocation of three-dimensional spaces and time. What they call "Z*hou*" is constituted by the one-dimensional series of changes in succession—the past continuing itself into the present and the present, into the future. *Yu* and *Zhou* taken together represent the primordial unity of the system of space with the system of time. Han Chinese consider the world, man, and history in terms of comprehensive harmony that permeates anything and everything (Fang, 1986). Everything in the Universe including the Universe itself, is changing all the time, and each has two opposite aspects: *Yin* and *Yang*, which are in conflict and at the same time interdependent; any change is the result of the *Yin-Yang* change within it. Everything is related to everything else in the Universe in the way they should be: the *Dao* or *Tao*.

**The Human Body and Five Elements.** Humans are part of the Universe, or nature, and the ideal relationship between humans and nature is harmony. Adaptation to nature and to be one with it is the way (*Dao*). The human body, like the larger Universe, is an organic whole. The various organs and tissues are all connected to one another. The connected system includes meridians (or channels) and collateral which are the lines along which blood, vital energy, and the impetus to functional processes move. While meridians are the cardinal lines, the collaterals are the branches at various levels, which form a structural network (Xie, 1995).

Due to Confucian norms of filial piety which forbid hurting the human body, anatomy is not very developed in Chinese medicine (Li, 1990). That is why it is quite different from Western medicine with regard to the structure and functions of the human body. What are called the visceral organs are referred to rather as comprehensive systems of physiological functions than as anatomical entities. Among the most important ones are the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney. But they are not the exact organs as understood in the English language. They should be read when used in the Chinese medical context, as the heart and/or higher nervous system (heart); the system that controls emotional activities, muscle action, bile secretion, and blood storage (liver); the system responsible for digestion, absorption, assimilation, and energy metabolism (spleen); respiratory system (lung); and the system which works to secrete urine and provide vital essence for heredity, reproduction, development as well as replenishing the brain, nourishing the bone, and producing marrow (kidney) (Xie,1995).

The relationship among the five systems is represented with the relationship among the five elements: fire,

![](_page_6_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 1.** Relationship among the five elements. (Translated from Li, 1989.)

earth, metal, water, and wood in a complete circle as shown in Figure 1.

Here one can see the attempt of the ancient Han people trying to illustrate the most important human organs or systems with things they considered basic in nature. Properties and nature of the five elements are being used to explain the relationships of the five visceral organs. In the scheme, things go clockwise in a circle with one promoting the one next to it, but constraining the one next but one to it as is shown in the five point star. This must be considered in case of diagnosis and treatment as everything must be taken into consideration in both processes.

In order to carry out their normal functions, these visceral organs and other organs and tissues need *Qi*, blood, vital essence, body fluid, and nutrients. Here *Qi* are the basic particles which constitute the cosmos and produce everything in the world through their movement and changes. In Chinese medicine it refers to the force or energy required for various functional processes. It consists of two sources, the inborn and the acquired.

#### **Concept of Illness**

In Chinese medicine disease is defined in terms of breaking up of the relative balance in the human body. According to this theory, there is an endless process of adaptation among all parts of the human body and between the human body and the environment. This process maintains a relative dynamic balance that in turn supports normal biological activities. When the human body is in harmony with the environment, pathogens will not harm it.

Diseases happen under two circumstances, one is when functional disorders occur in the human body and the "right *Qi*" is relatively weak, and the other is when strong "evil *Qi*" has affected the body. Right *Qi* means normal functional activities and the body's ability to resist diseases, and the evil *Qi* means pathogenic factors. Onset and changes of the disease reflect the course of the struggle between the right *Qi* and the evil *Qi*.

The Han people attach primary importance to maintaining the right *Qi* which largely means "immunity" in terms of Western medicine. Diseases strike only when the right *Qi* is relatively weak. Outcome of the struggle between the right *Qi* and the evil *Qi* depends on the constitution, mental state, environment, habits, nutrition and exercise.

Pathogenic factors include atmospheric factors, epidemic pestilence, personal emotions, improper foods and physical fatigue, traumatic injuries, parasites, phlegmrheum, and blood stagnancy.

There are six excessive atmospheric factors (*liu Yin*) that are wind, cold, heat, damp, dryness, and fire. Normally these natural changes will not cause diseases. They do only when the body's resistance is low and adapts poorly to natural changes, or abnormal natural changes become too much for the body. Sometimes in-coordination among different organs may also produce the same symptoms. These are called "internal wind," "internal cold," "internal heat," "internal damp," "internal dryness," and "internal fire."

There are seven emotions that are the normal reactions to the outside world, but when subjected to repeated long term stimuli, especially drastic ones, each may cause imbalance between the *Yin* and *Yang*, between the *Qi* and blood, and malfunction of the internal organs, thus leading to diseases.

#### **Classification of Illness**

Chinese medicine classifies diseases according to their major patterns in terms of *Yin* and *Yang*, internal and external, heat and cold, vacuity and excess. In connection to the state of *Qi*, blood, body fluids, and different body functions, it identifies the nature of the major problems as external cold, external heat, internal cold, internal heat, excess, vacuity, *Yin* problems, *Yang* problems, *Qi* inadequacy, blood inadequacy, etc.

#### **Methods of Diagnosis**

Doctors of Chinese medicine diagnose in four major ways including inquiry (asking questions concerning body temperature and how the patient feels, perspiration, general body feeling, urination and stool, diet, feelings of the lung and stomach, monthly discharges in case of woman, etc.), visual observation (patient's mood, face color, shape of body, and color, shape of the tongue, etc.), smelling and listening (patient's body odor and voice), and pulsation. Generally the information collected and the observed symptoms are enough to help the doctor determine the nature of the disease. Today doctors of Chinese medicine are also using modern equipment and methods such as stereoscope, X-ray, CT, etc., to verify conclusions.

#### **Treatment Principles**

**Prevention as Priority.** The overall guiding rule in treating diseases in Chinese medicine is determining the root cause. It includes two aspects: one is taking precautions before disease strikes; the other is prevention after a disease strikes. There are many formulas and methods to help enhance the immune system. As early as the 16th century, the Han people invented inoculation for smallpox. After a disease strikes, medical practice tries to intercept possible pathological changes. For instance, when the liver is out of order, it is important to protect and strengthen the spleen.

**Balance as the Ideal State of Health.** Because everything is connected to everything else in a relationship of cooperation and coordination it is the mission of Chinese medicine to redress any imbalance. What is more, in reestablishing this balance, efforts must be taken to avoid creating any new imbalance. That is why treatment with Chinese medicine is expected to be slow and noninvasive (Liu, 2002).

**Holistic Considerations and Individualized Treatment.** In prevention, diagnosis and treatment, everything, including the season and local conditions, physical and psychological environment, the patient's age, gender and general physical conditions, family history, etc., all have to be considered. A patient from a Western culture may feel uncomfortable with a doctor of Chinese medicine when the doctor asks questions that are too personal.

Chinese medicine is an art of healing, and a good doctor of Chinese medicine treats the patient rather than the disease. Since everyone is a complete organism himself subject to different physical and psychological environments and every organism is changing all the time, every patient is necessarily different in Chinese medical concept, and therefore everyone must necessarily be treated differently. Every patient needs to be examined individually and individualized diagnosis must be made, and the treatment is unique. In high plateaus that are cold and dry, exterior pathological factors are mainly related to cold and dryness and treatment should use herbs that have the property of dissipating aridity, enriching, and moistening; and in an environment of heat and damp such as lowland area, herbs that can dispel heat and transform damp should be given the priority. Even in the same location, patients are different. For an instance, two persons are both diagnosed by Western medical doctors as having essential hypertension. But patient one is robust with a red face, red eyes, constipation, irritability, a thick yellow coated red tongue, and a wiry full pulse. A doctor of Chinese medicine would provide a treatment to calm down his or her liver fire (to cleanse the liver). Since patient two has pale and frail appearance, loose stools, low energy, pale flabby tongue, and a weak pulse, the same doctor would formulate a treatment plan to invigorate the patient's kidney *Yang* (to tonify the kidney).

**Strengthen the Immune System and Eliminate Pathogenic Factors.** In case of weak defenses, the emphasis has to be on enhancing the immune system in order to eliminate pathogens. On the other hand, when pathogenic factors are too strong, the focus has to be the elimination of pathogenic factors in order to strengthen the body's defenses. Sometimes, it is also necessary to do both at the same time.

**Differentiation of Root Cause from Symptoms and Determination of Acuteness of the Disease.** To treat the root cause instead of the symptoms is always the principal aim of Chinese medicine, but in treatment considerations are given to the actual circumstances. For instance when it is a mild disease and not acute, it is right to treat the root cause. In case of acute diseases however, it may be necessary to treat the symptoms first. When the patient is running a high fever, bleeding, or suffering from severe pain, the symptoms themselves may lead to death if no drastic measure is taken to treat the symptoms. Eliminating the high fever, stopping bleeding and pain are imperative before going for the root cause. In some cases it may be better to treat both the root cause and the symptoms.

#### **Straight Treatment and Paradoxical Treatment.**

Straight treatment is to meet cold with heat and heat with cold, supplement in case of inadequacy (vacuity), and discharge in case of excess. These are the normal ways of treatment. However, when symptoms do not reflect the root cause, the opposite is called for. For instance cold symptoms may be the result of extreme heat, and in such case the right way is to use cold method. This paradoxical treatment is a hallmark of a good doctor.

#### **Methods of Treatment**

Since Chinese medicine is nutrition oriented, it treats various health problems in terms of excess syndromes, deficiency syndromes, and deficiency with excess syndromes. Deficiency includes deficiency in *Qi*, in blood, in *Yin* and *Yang*; excess includes excess in wind, cold, heat, damp, dryness, fire, phlegm, and *Qi*.

There are numerous methods of treatment in Chinese medicine, but basically there are eight approaches that are used singularly or in combination as the situation calls for: (1) The diaphoretic approach induces sweat to expel pathogenic factors. It is used for external problems such as unripe pox, sores, and boils. It may be due to external cold or external heat, and therefore there are two basic ways which are resolution of exterior with coolness and acridity, or resolution of exterior with warmth and acridity; (2) the emetic approach induces vomiting to expel pathogenic factors or toxins. It is used in case of thick phlegm in the throat or stagnant or poisonous food in the stomach; (3) the purgation approach is used in case of serious constipation, bloating, stagnant phlegm and blood, or in case of parasites. It is comprised of cold purgation, warm purgation, expelling of water, dissolution of stagnation, or expelling parasites; (4) the harmonization approach is used to resolve poor co-ordination between internal organs in their functions. Malaria and irregular menses are also treated this way; (5) the warming approach is taken

mainly to dispel cold pathogens, etc., as in case of internal cold pattern of diseases; (6) the febrifugal approach is to remove internal heat to protect body fluids; (7) the tonification approach is employed in case of deficiency or vacuity including tonification of the *Yin*, tonification of the *Yang*, tonification of blood and tonification of the *Qi*, etc.; and (8) the dispersion approach is used for stasis and accumulation in blood, *Qi*, phlegm, rheum and foods, etc.

It is obvious that the objective of all these is to achieve balance and harmony of the various organs and their functions while dynamic biological changes and processes are maintained.

#### **Classification of Medicine**

**Sources of Chinese Medicine.** Chinese medicine is characterized by natural, low cost, and nutrition oriented sources. So far there are 12,807 medicinal materials out of which 11,146 are herbs, 1,581 are from animal sources, and 80 minerals (*Encyclopedia Sinica*, Volume of Chinese Medicine, 2000 Edition). Because of the predominance of herbal sources, people refer to Chinese materia medica as herbal medicine. Based upon principles of Chinese medicine in formulation, there are more than one million patent formulas that can be adjusted with addition or reduction of some ingredients to suit particular needs of the patient. They represent a great rich treasure house for health care and fitness.

**Properties of Herbs.** Herbs are said to have four properties: cold, cool, warm, and hot, and five flavors: sour, bitter, sweet, pungent, and salty. The four properties have nothing to do with the temperature of the herbs. They are the resulting effects produced by the herbs. Coptis, phellodendron bark, gardenia fruit are classified as cold medicine because they eliminate heat, dryness, remove toxins, and they are normally used to tackle heat patterns of diseases, while aconite and dry ginger are classified as hot medicine because they are normally employed to warm the center and dispel cold.

From the beginning, Chinese medical practitioners found that herbs of certain taste possessed certain medical properties. With long historical development, the five flavors actually come to represent the properties rather than the actual flavor or taste. Herbs with sour flavor possess the ability of astriction and are used to treat seminal emission, night sweating, enuresis, enduring diarrhea, anal desertion, etc. Those with bitter flavor including such herbs as coptis, phellodendron bark, gardenia fruit, etc., have the properties of dispelling heat, dryness, and toxins. Sweet herbs generally tonify and supplement, relax tension (acuteness), and harmonize the functions of different herbs. For instance, codynopsis, astragalus, and cooked rehmannia tonify and supplement in case of vacuity. Licorice and sugar relax tension, and harmonize different herbs. Pungent herbs disperse external pathogens, move the *Qi* and promote blood circulation. Mahuang treats wind cold and external problems, Cnidium (Chuangxiong) activates the blood, and carthamus disperses accumulation. Salty herbs soften hardness and drain precipitation and are used to treat scrofula, phlegm nodes, lump glomus, and dry and hard stool. Oyster shell, for instance, may help disperse hard lumps, and mirabilitum can ease constipation.

Flavor and properties of an herb must be considered together. Herbs of same properties may be different in their flavor, and vice versa.

Herbs are also classified according to their tendency to reach certain parts of the body or channels. This selectivity of the herbs in their functions is called *gui jing* (channel entry). For instance, both phragmite and gentian root belong to cold herbs used to clear away heat. However, the former is particularly effective in clearing lung heat and the latter heat of the liver.

According to their functions herbs are classified into more than 20 categories, including diaphoretics or exterior resolution herbs, either for dispelling wind-cold or wind-heat; Antipyretis or Ferifuges; Antitussive, Expectorants and Anti-asthmatics; Digestives; Tonics including *Qi* replenishing herbs, blood replenishing herbs, *Yin* replenishing herbs and *Yang* replenishing herbs; Carminatives or *Qi* flow herbs; Blood circulators to remove blood stagnation; Hemostatics; Laxatives; Diuretics; Fragrant herbs for resolving damp; Antirheumatics including herbs for arthritic pain, for muscles and collaterals and for strengthening the bone and tendons; Warming herbs; Anticonvulsants; Sedatives; Aromatic stimulants; Astringents; Anti-malarial herbs; Anthelmintics; Analgesics, and Topical agents. These herbs are used as soldiers for specific missions whether singly or in groups to achieve prevention or curative effects.

**Herb Preparation.** Doctors of Chinese medicine are very sensitive to authenticity of the herbs depending upon the areas where they are produced. Through longtime observation and composition they know that some herbs produced in certain areas are best in quality and therefore in curative effects. Ginseng, deer antler, and schisandra fruit in northeast China, rehemannia root, Chinese Yam of Henan, coptis root and fritillary bulb in Sichuan, wolfberry in Ningxia, and notoginseng in Yunnan are the most famous. They are more sought after than others.

Herbs must be carefully prepared and processed before they are used. Preparations include stir baking with or without auxiliary fluids (such as vinegar, wine, honey, salt water or ginger juice), calcination, roasting, steaming, boiling, water purification, fermentation, germination, and frosting. Different preparations may enhance the curative effects, reduce toxicity, remove undesired ingredients and taste, and make them easy to use and store.

**Prescription Formulation Principles.** After diagnosis and determination of the treatment principles, the doctor of Chinese medicine decides the principal herb and the auxiliary herbs in the formulation to achieve the curative effects wanted. Sometimes a single herb is used, but most often it is a compound preparation that may consist of anything from four to twenty herbs.

A compound prescription normally includes four different component parts. They are called Monarch (principal), Minister (adjuvant), Assistant (auxiliary), and Guide (conductor) respectively.

The principal ingredient provides the main curative action. The adjuvant helps strengthen the principal action; the auxiliary is a corrector ingredient to relieve secondary symptoms or to temper the action of the principal when it is too potent, and the conductor is to direct the actions of the principal and adjuvant herbs to the affected area or site or acts as a minor ingredient.

In a compound prescription, drug interactions must be considered. According to Chinese medicine, herbs may be either mutually reinforcing, mutually restraining (to weaken or neutralize each other's actions), mutually counteracting (one ingredient reduces the potency or toxicity of another), mutually neutralizing (one counteracts the toxic reaction of another), or mutually incompatible. Modern research has found that some of these relationships are valid and some are not. However a good herbal doctor is one who knows really well the properties of the herbs and uses them correctly and innovatively to treat his patients.

#### **"Food Therapy"**

A very important medical tradition is what is called *shi liao*, that is, food therapy. The origin of this can be traced back in history to several thousand years. *The Shennong's Herbal* (*shen nong ben cao jing)* carries 365 herbs classified into three categories including superior, medium, and lower grades. Most of those listed as superior are food grains, vegetables, fruits, meats, and herbs with a friendly nature. As herbal drugs are strong and taste awful, and long-term use may hurt the stomach, the best way is to use food to do the work. This is considered an ideal since foods may not only cure in the long run, but may also be made into something enjoyable. Food therapy follows the same principle as herbal treatment, that is, to warm up when cold is present, cool off when heat is the problem, to supplement in case of deficiency (vacuity) and discharge in case of excess. For this, food items are classified into different categories according to their properties and diet is planned in such a way as to achieve therapeutic result in different situations. Food therapy is often employed to supplement medical treatments, especially for chronic diseases.

#### **Health through Proper Diet**

Another tradition based on Chinese medicine is called *shi yang*, health through proper diet. It is to select certain diet to regulate various biological functions of the related organs of the body, to nurture the *Qi*, the blood, body fluids, to build up the body's resistance to diseases according to different needs in terms of constitution, age, gender, the season or local conditions. For this, people are classified into several types with different constitutions. For instance, those who tend to suffer *Qi* deficiency should include yam, lotus seeds, pork, and eel in their diet, and those who have blood deficiency problem should include longan, wolfberry, mulberry leaf, chicken, carrots, etc. Those who have *Yin* deficiency should eat white fungus, honey, sesame, black bean, etc. And those who are identified to have *Yang* deficiency should add mutton, shrimp, chives, etc. Foods are different in different seasons, and local conditions differ. People in different regions have different needs in foods.

### **"***Yangsheng***" (Life Preservation)**

*Shi liao* and *Shi Yang* are included in another wider approach called "*Yangsheng*," that is, life preservation. This includes a variety of ways to prolong life.

A very important part of *Yangsheng* is *Qigong*. It is to achieve good health through breathing exercises, meditation, mental channeling, etc. As a component part of Chinese medicine it has a history of over 4,000 years originating from a kind of dance to maintain good health and to prevent diseases. Along the way it absorbed many elements from Daoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism and in a way it also acquired some religious characteristics to certain extent (He, 1998). The key concept is energy cultivation. It is said to be very effective in eliminating fatigue and achieving relaxation, enhancing the immune system for prevention of diseases, and treating and curing diseases connected with certain systems such as the nervous system, the circulatory system, the respiratory system, the digestive system, the endocrine system, and the immune system.

Many schools have developed over the years. Most of the Chinese medical writings cover *Qigong* exercises. The best known is the *Taiji* exercise, a set of slow movements which have spread far and wide outside of China. During the so-called "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" from mid 1960s to mid 1970s, *Qigong* was suppressed until the chaos was over. In 1986, the Degree Committee under the State Council made a decision to adopt *Qigong* in Chinese medicine as a new science discipline, and special funds were set up for further research and it became part of clinical treatment. Doing *Qigong* became part of daily life, especially in the morning in parks.

Currently the enthusiasm for *Qigong* seems to have had a setback with the government suppressing the *Falun Gong*, a quasi-religious group officially named an evil cult. It started as a *Qigong* organization and attracted many people. The government was taken by surprise when suddenly it organized a mammoth sit-in demonstration surrounding the government seat in Beijing.

Another area of *Yangsheng* is to control desire and avoid indulgence, especially sexual indulgence. Selfemotional control is also a very important part of these exercises. All these are aimed at achieving balance between *Yin* and *Yang*, promoting normal flow of the *Qi* and blood, increasing the essence and preserving the semen.

#### *Tuina*

Another treatment method in Chinese medicine is *tuina*, a special type of therapeutic massage. The origin can be traced back to pre-historic times. Its basic therapeutic orientation is the Chinese medical theory of the flow of *Qi* through the meridians. *Tuina* has many unique techniques including one finger pushing, rolling, *neigong* (internal *Qigong*), pointing, bone setting, etc. It can be done alone or in combination with *Qigong*.

#### **Acupuncture and Moxibustion**

Originally a component part of Chinese medicine, acupuncture and moxibustion have developed into a medical system in themselves. Two things are involved, one is to stimulate locals on the human body to achieve therapeutic effects, and the other is to use heat to achieve therapeutic results. They are used either separately or in combination. The origin can be traced to Neolithic times, 8,000 to 4,000 years ago. Needles were made of stones, wood, bamboo and finally metal, especially silver or stainless steel. Moxibustion uses leaves of mugwort (artemesia vulgaris) made into a cone and burned on oilment or ginger slice. The basis of both acupuncture and moxibustion is the concept of channels (meridians and collaterals) in the human body through which *Qi* travels. Channels (meridians and collaterals) are distributed all over the body and coordination or various functional processes are realized through the *Qi*. Acupuncture and moxibustion rely on the relationship between the *Qi* and the meridians for successful therapy (Xie, 1995).

Now electricity, magnets, laser, infra-red, and microwave are added to needle stimulation. Clinically it is comprised of four aspects: treatment with acupuncture and moxibustion, maintenance of good health with acupuncture and moxibustion (mainly to enhance the immune system), anesthesia with acupuncture and diagnosis through channel-local manipulation. Acupuncture has been accepted as legal and valid method of treatment in many countries in the world.

## **SEXUALITY AND REPRODUCTION**

#### **Sexual Attitudes**

As noted above, Chinese medicine holds that congenital essence is responsible for reproduction. It is stored in the kidney and serves as the origin of life. Congenital essence can be transformed into acquired essence and vice versa. Sexual over-indulgence is regarded as one of the major causes of disease. Exhaustion of the reproductive essence stored in the kidney impairs other organs and has serious health consequences. For this serious efforts were made, especially among the leisure class, to preserve semen. Many writings, mostly Daoist in nature, discussed ways of sex without ejaculation. Occasionally some "masters" would advocate sex with young girls as it was thought to be tonifying for the man. In a way, women are considered dangerous for a man since she could deplete him of semen.

People generally avoid talking of sex. The purpose of marriage is understood to be to produce children to continue the family line. Sex, except for producing children, is generally considered immoral. So there has been great secrecy surrounding sex.

#### **Seclusion of Women**

Historically, seclusion of women was practiced and premarital sex was strictly forbidden. Marriages were arranged by parents and often the nuptial night was the first time the couple met. It was a great scandal if the bride was found to not be a virgin. Even now it is still common to have a relative or a friend to "introduce" a girl or a boy since it may be considered improper to approach the opposite sex directly for purpose of marriage.

Traditionally, only men could initiate divorce and a divorced woman carried stigma and little hope of a happy remarriage.

### **Fertility**

The average lifetime fertility rate of Chinese women was reported to be 1.81 (1.98 in rural and 1.22 in urban areas) in 2001 (National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Survey, 2001). As the Han are a huge majority, this may well represent the fertility of Han women.

Barren women are considered unlucky and for a long time it was blamed on the woman if a couple failed to produce children or failed to produce a boy. It was generally hoped that a married couple should have as many children as possible and begin to have children as early as possible. It was common to find a woman having eight or even ten children. After 1949, there was a time when having more children was encouraged by the Chinese government until there was a population explosion. Since then there has been a policy encouraging late marriage and fewer children. During the seventies and eighties, the policy was to allow only one child per couple among the Han people while minorities may have more. The policy was quite successful in urban areas while in the countryside it was

#### **Health through the Life Cycle 715**

not so successful. As only the male child would be able to continue the family line, people generally prefer a boy, and the government One Child Policy met with great resistance. Forced abortion took place frequently, but rural people could evade it in several ways. Abandoning of unwanted children and infanticide due to poverty were quite common before 1949. After 1949, they were virtually eliminated. But the One Child Policy led to frequent female infanticide and abortion of female fetuses. The Fifth National Census (2000) reported the sex ratio at 116.9:100, alarmingly different from the international ratio of 105:100. Specialists attribute this to social factors and biological factors, but to what extent infanticide of female children, selective abortion or other factors each contributed to this ratio remains unexplained.

#### **Ideal Household**

Large families comprising three or four generations are generally considered ideal. Historical records often highlight large families, sometimes with a few hundred people living under the same roof. But these are exceptions rather than the rule. Statistics show that the average family size through different times in history was 4.84 persons (Qiao, 1990), though the clan, mostly under the same surname and therefore having the same ancestry, could be quite strong organizationally. The 2000 census indicated that the current average family size is 3.44 per family. There are many joint families and extended families in the countryside, but most of the families in the urban areas are nuclear families.

## **HEALTH THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE**

#### **Pregnancy and Birth**

Since the purpose of marriage is to have children, especially male children, the news of pregnancy is always a good one to the family and it is also the beginning of good expectations, particularly for a boy. People begin to be protective of the pregnant woman and she may be excused from heavy labor. Habits and practices around pregnancy and birth differ from place to place. The husband's mother may even go to a temple to pray for a healthy grandson. Generally the expectant mother should not go to unlikely places such as the burial ground or participate in a funeral. There are taboos as to what she may or may not eat. For instance, in some places she is not to eat rabbit for fear of giving birth to a child with cleft palate.

Han people had the practice of what is called "fetus education" in order to have a child healthy both physically and mentally. The mother should avoid sex, noise, bad thoughts, and bad images, and adhere to correct and nice language and demeanors.

A birth of a boy was called "great happiness" which was an occasion of elaborate celebrations and the mother's position in the family could be said as established, while a birth of a girl was called "small happiness." Normally there was not a problem if the first child was a girl as she may help take care of her younger siblings. It would become worrisome if the couple continued to have girls. The One Child Policy puts great pressure on women to have a boy.

Traditionally babies were born at home with help from a midwife and other experienced women. No man or child should be present, though the husband was normally kept close by for emergencies. His urine was sometimes given to the wife to drink in case of difficult labor. Children are generally kept from any knowledge about sex and birth. The answer to the question of where the baby is from is answered evasively. Often it is said to have been picked up from a dung-heap outside by accident.

As of 1999, 70% of deliveries were in hospitals. Hospital births are much higher in urban areas (83.3%) than in the countryside (61.5%). Births with new delivery methods (both in and out of hospitals) account for 96.8% of all births (China Yearbook of Health, 2000). Formerly the greatest risk for the new born baby was tetanus due to use of dirty scissors and un-sterilized cloth ropes to tie the umbilical cord, and for the mother it was puerperal or childbed fevers. Infant mortality in China was rated the highest in the world, 275 per 1,000 live births in 1927, and maternal death was estimated to be about 200 or more per 10,000 live births, at least three times that of western countries (Simoons, 1992). Since then things have changed and infant mortality in 1990 was 33 per 1,000 and maternal death was 95 per 100,000 (China Yearbook of Health, 2000).

For the first month after birth, both mother and child are kept indoors for fear of severe environmental conditions such as drastic temperature changes and evil spirits. For the mother, this is called "doing the month" (*zuo-yuezi*) when she is given nutritious food to recuperate and to generate enough milk for the baby. This was perhaps the only occasion for her to enjoy extra treatment since in daily life women were expected to eat last and poorest.

Traditionally, a new mother had to avoid any exercise and washing of her body and hair for fear of future chronic diseases such as arthritis and headache. For government employees these mothers are given a paid leave. If no one in the family can take care of the baby, she would put the child in a nursery during the day when she returns to work.

#### **Infancy**

A newborn baby is taken care of by everybody in the family. A preferred caretaker both of the new mother and the baby is the husband's mother. In some regions the baby is tied with three cloth-made ropes, one just under the shoulders, the second around its waist with both hands on the sides, and the third just above the ankles. From time to time the grandmother would turn the baby to a different direction and a well-cared baby would have a round head and long limbs. Breast-feeding is generally the rule and may continue for up to 3 or even 5 years; 90–95% of infants were reported nursed by their mothers (Simoons, 1992). Newborn babies are kept from people considered unlucky, such as widows and those who have serious diseases. When traveling with young children, it was important to come back the same way so that their souls may not get lost. When the child was thought to have lost its soul the mother or grandmother would knock the door upper lintel with a ladle to call it back. In some places children are shaved with a pigtail behind called "*gui-jian-chou*," meaning "devil's fear" to ward evils away. It is quite common to have a boy with a name of a girl to appear cheap so he may be left alone by evil spirits. Children whom the family considered vulnerable and had fear of losing may even be given a name meaning, a dog, or a monk to ensure their safety. A boy may be called "*ya-tou*" (girl) for the same reason. To ensure safety of the child, the family might also make clothes for it from oddments of cloth, or a meal of rice collected from a hundred families.

### **Childhood**

Children were taken care of by the elders, preferably the grandmother on the father's side, (though it is quite common, and even more preferably by the grandmother on the mother's side in urban areas), and older siblings. Corporal punishment is common and people believe it is good for the child. Traditionally Han Chinese thought children belonged to and were at disposal of their parents, grandparents, etc., and theoretically these elders could do anything with them. It was not even a crime to kill them if they so wished. Generally there was no concept of child abuse as such. How to treat children was a moral issue rather then a legal one until recently.

With older siblings as caretakers and playmates, it helped to build up the pecking order according to age and form close sibling relations called *Ti* (fraternal duty) among them. But the One Child Policy of the government in which a couple is allowed to have only one child has changed this enormously. Social scientists are worried that a future generation without siblings will lead to social problems. A popular name for these children is "small emperors" characterized as spoiled, selfish, overweight, etc.

#### **Adolescence**

Children participate in adult activities early and learn life skills by direct observation or by assisting adults in chores. Anthropologists say that traditional Chinese (Han) children did not have adolescence. Girls were taught skills they would need after marriage. There was virtually no sex education especially in the countryside where young people had to pick up scraps of sexual knowledge from older friends. Now children begin to go to school at 6 or 7, mostly in their own neighborhoods in urban areas and villages in the countryside. They are encouraged to help their parents in their work, especially during vacations.

### **Adulthood**

Traditional Han society considered men and women adults at marriage. The basic objective in life was to take care of the man's parents and other elders in the family and to have children to continue the family line. Marriage was arranged by parents and other elders in the family with help from gobetweens. Ideal age of marriage was 16 for the bride and 18 for the bridegroom, but often a girl child was taken to her husband's house to be raised by her parents-in-law first. After 1950s, free choice has been encouraged though in most cases people still use friends or relatives as gobetweens to introduce the couple to avoid embarrassment. Menopause starts between 45 and 49.

### **The Aged**

Age carried great respect and authority in traditional Han society. The eldest male was generally the family head

#### **References 717**

with decision-making powers. Normally they had light work and would be given better food and tonics to eat. They were the center of everybody's attention and it was the obligation for everyone to take good care of them. On important occasions they were worshiped by everybody in the family. Even today, elderly people continue to live with family until they die, and only those who do not have sons or daughters are living in what is called "*jing-laoyuan*" (home to respect the elderly), the Chinese version of a nursing home paid by the community.

China is an aging society. In 2000, one in every 10 people was 60 years of age or older. Those beyond 65 made up more than 7% of the population. The sharp decrease in birth rate since the mid 1970s has resulted in a huge number of one-child families. By around 2010, parents of these single children will be getting frail or senile. In the future, an adult couple will have to support four parents and one child. With rising cost for child rearing, including education and medical care, the financial burden on the couple will be formidable. Besides, senile dementia, common for senior citizens, will rank the third highest health problem in incidence by the middle of the 21st century, next only to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Caring for these people will become a big problem for families psychologically and economically. There is an urgent need to build a social security system (Zhang, 2002).

### **Dying and Death**

Traditional Han people believed in a next life after death and it was imperative for the living to send money and necessities for their comforts. This is the reason why one should not die sonless. Only those who had a grandson (son's son only) could avoid becoming hungry ghosts. The dead would be washed and dressed in their best, normally black suits or coats. Mourning would continue for days depending upon family means and what the astrologer would say. The occasion was important for the large clan members and relatives to revisit the notion how closely related they were with each other either through the dead or other connections.

Han people used to bury their dead and every clan or family would have their own burial ground where people went to burn paper money and other things, and cremation was limited to abnormal death such as death in traumatic accidents and painful diseases. Since the late 1960s, the Chinese government began to encourage cremation and forbid burial in order to save land for agriculture. Now urban residents have accepted cremation, but many rural people still bury their dead.

A rich family may invite Buddhist or Daoist monks or both to recite sutras to add to the merits of the dead so that they would be treated well in their next life by being sent to heaven.
