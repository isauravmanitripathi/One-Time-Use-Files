# **LOCATION AND LINGUISTIC AFFILIATION**

The Matsigenka are people of the *montaña*, the rugged rainforests of the upper Amazon fringing the eastern slope of the Andes. They currently number about twelve thousand people inhabiting the Urubamba, upper Madre de Dios, and Manu River basins in south-east Peru. Matsigenka belongs to the pre-Andine group of Arawakan languages that also includes Ashaninka (Campa) and Yine (Piro).

# **OVERVIEW OF THE CULTURE**

Traditionally, the Matsigenka have lived in small, scattered, highly autonomous settlements organized around the household and the residence group showing a strong preference for matrilocal residence. Kinship follows a Dravidian pattern prescribing bilateral cross-cousin marriage (Johnson & Johnson, 1975). Polygamy was common in the past but has become less frequent. The Matsigenka continue to make important decisions within the household and residence group. At certain historical moments, political and economic integration under tyrannical leaders called *kurakas* has emerged, always in response to outside forces (Camino, 1977; Renard-Casevitz, 1991).

The Matsigenka subsist on a combination of fishing, hunting, forest foraging, and long-fallow swidden agriculture. They grow the staples of sweet manioc, plantains, and bananas alongside diverse other crops, medicinal plants, and fruit trees that mature as gardens are abandoned to forest regeneration. Women spin native cotton and weave tunic-like garments on backstrap looms. Women spend tremendous time and effort in preparing manioc beer (*ovuiroki*), the centerpiece of Matsigenka social life, consumed in great quantities at cathartic drinking parties.

The principal rites of passage—birth, adolescence, death, and mourning—are private, family matters accompanied by quiet, symbolic acts: dietary and behavioral restrictions, a degree of social isolation, and the use of special medicinal plants. Codes for good and bad behavior, though not expressed in legal or religious institutions, are reflected in folklore, interpretations of illness, and many aspects of daily life. Traditional medicine addresses many kinds of misfortune and serves as an arena for expressing and resolving social strife.

Missionary activity throughout the 20th century provoked major changes. Catholic missions were established at strategic points along the main river courses, serving as hubs of commerce and points of departure for colonization and development projects. Beginning in the 1950s, Protestant missionaries of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) began evangelical work in the hinterlands, contacting and settling dispersed Matsigenka households into large, permanent communities. Although SIL's main goal was evangelical, their work also included health care, linguistic, and ethnographic study (Snell, 1964; Snell, 1998; Snell & Davis, 1976), community organization, and bilingual education. Communal land rights and democratic representation were established formally in 1974 by the populist "Law of Native Communities." Currently there exist some thirty-five legally recognized Matsigenka communities with populations ranging from a few dozen to over three hundred inhabitants.

# **THE CONTEXT OF HEALTH: ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL FACTORS**

The health status of the Matsigenka depends upon tightly interwoven cultural, environmental, epidemiological, economic, and historical factors. Their dependence on scattered forest resources provides a centrifugal force that is opposed by the centripetal forces of agriculture, social life, and more recently, education, health care, and economic opportunities available in permanent communities. Each family and community strikes a unique balance, affecting health, nutrition, and livelihood in complex ways. Protein in the Matsigenka diet comes mostly from high quality, animal sources, though it accounts for only 10% of caloric intake. Over three quarters of dietary calories come from the staple starches of manioc and bananas. Research among the Matsigenka has judged child health to be compromised by protein deficiency (Cueva, 1990), although deficiencies were not as marked as in other Amazonian populations. Game depletion around sedentary communities exacerbates existing deficiencies, prompting migrations or alternative economic strategies.

The health and destiny of the Matsigenka have been shaped by powerful exogenous forces. During the "rubber fever" (1895–1917), native people throughout the Amazon were enslaved, brutalized, and exposed to devastating epidemics. Von Hassel (1904) notes that the Matsigenka were highly sought after as laborers in Manu's infamous rubber camps, and estimates that more than 60% of those conscripted died. Slave raiding, debt peonage, violence, and tribal dislocation continued throughout much of the 20th century (Alvarez-Lobo,

1996; Lyon, 1984; Shepard & Chicchon, 2001; Townsley, 1987). Many native groups, including many Matsigenka, survived these grim years only by isolating themselves from outsiders, some through the present (Shepard, 1999a, p. 47). Yet isolation has severe consequences: interethnic warfare; fragmentation of intermarrying units; inability to obtain trade items; reduction or abandonment of agriculture; and high rates of mortality when Western contact is re-established.

The efficacy of antibiotics proved to be crucial in the missionaries' success in settling the Matsigenka in permanent communities. Today, contacted Matsigenka depend on Western medicines for their survival. Medicinal plants are effective for treating some common ailments, but epidemic diseases, especially the feared and deadly grippe (*merentsi*), have overwhelmed the capacities of traditional medicine. Moreover, some missionaries have been intent on stamping out traditional medicine, especially shamanism.

Gastrointestinal and respiratory conditions are the most common causes of disease and death among the Matsigenka and other Amazonian indigenous populations (see Figure 1). Respiratory illnesses cause extremely high rates of mortality in the initial years of Western contact (note Panoan cases in Figure 1). Even in acculturated

communities, new cold and flu strains arrive continually, often developing into virulent pneumonia. In communities without adequate latrines or potable water, fecal contamination of soil and water leads to a high incidence of roundworm, amoebas, and other parasites, especially when seasonal flooding exacerbates existing sanitation problems. Snakebite and other accidents (e.g., falling from a tree) are not infrequent and sometimes fatal among children and adults, and interethnic warfare was a significant cause of death in some populations until recently. Tuberculosis has become prevalent in some areas, while malaria, sexually transmitted diseases, and rabies break out sporadically in the Urubamba region, but are not yet documented in Manu. Eye and ear infections, dental caries, and a variety of skin conditions (mycosis, leishmaniasis, scabies, boils, bot fly larvae, chigoes, infected wounds) are common but do not contribute to mortality.

Studies with other Amazonian groups suggest that health status declines with initial Western contact (Jelliffe, 1966; Neel, 1974). Nonetheless, improvements in sanitation and health care in acculturated communities may be effective in eventually reversing this trend. A biomedical study at Kamisea (Izquierdo, 2001, 2002) following up on a similar study 20 years prior (Strongin, 1982) suggests that objective health indicators have improved significantly. Yet ironically, the people of Kamisea report a subjective experience of increasing illness, social strife, and distress for the same period. This discrepancy illustrates the complex and sometimes contradictory health implications of rapid social change. The proliferation of sorcery accusations in Westernized communities testifies to the coincidence between exotic illnesses and new kinds of social and economic stress (Izquierdo 2001, p. 250; Shepard 2002c, p. 9). Western media images also exert a perverse influence on traditional concepts of health and beauty (Yu & Shepard, 1998). Most Peruvians and some Matsigenka welcome the economic development that promises to accompany the exploitation of the Kamisea gas fields in the Matsigenka heartland. Others, however, are worried about negative social, environmental, and health consequences (Rivera, 1991). Echoing traditional cosmological and etiological notions, some Matsigenka fear that the perforation of wells might unleash demons and illness from the bowels of the earth (Shepard,1999b). The plight of indigenous peoples in Ecuador, Colombia, and Nigeria at the hand of transnational petrochemical companies appears to justify these fears (see Kimerling, 1991).

# **MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS**

Shaman-healers among the Matsigenka are known as *seripigari*, "tobacco-intoxicated ones" (Baer, 1992). Seripigari use tobacco and psychoactive plants to enter into a trance, communicate with spirits, and treat spiritbased illnesses (Shepard, 1998). They are usually men, but women are sometimes mentioned. The seripigari undergoes an apprenticeship with an experienced shaman and gains special powers by fostering a relationship with benevolent spirits known as *Saangariite*, "Invisible/Pure Ones." The seripigari sing esoteric songs to invoke spirits or call wayward souls, and use their magical breath to locate and suck sorcery objects (spines, stones, herbs, etc.) from the patient's body. More than healers, the seripigari are ambassadors to the cosmos who negotiate with the forces of nature to ensure the availability of game, acquire new crop varieties, and control the elements. The seripigari are heroes in Matsigenka mythology, however in actual practice, they are beset by moral ambiguity. The same powers required to cure illness can also be used to cause it. The Matsigenka distinguish between healing shamans and illness-causing sorcerers (*matsikanari*), however any shaman may be a suspect for sorcery accusations. This inherent moral ambiguity has been fueled by Christian missionaries' denunciations of shamans as "Devil worshipers." Furthermore, shamans were ineffective in halting the devastating epidemics. The seripigari have been apparently driven into hiding or extinction in many communities. Recent ethnographies note that the Matsigenka deny the existence of seripigari in their communities (see Bennett, 1991, p. 380; Shepard, 1999a, p. 82; Izquierdo, 2001, p. 233). Yet after years of such denials, Shepard (1999a) discovered that seripigari were in fact active (albeit discreetly) in several communities in the Manu and Madre de Dios Regions.

A new breed of practitioners known as "steam bath healers" (*itsimpokantavagetira*) has emerged in acculturated communities of the Urubamba, apparently filling the void left by the absent (or secretive) seripigari. Like seripigari, steam bath healers are able to remove intrusive pathogenic objects from patients suffering sorcery and other spirit illnesses. Unlike the seripigari, steam bath healers do not use tobacco or psychoactive plants and do not enter trance. Instead, they subject the patient to a steam bath by placing scalding hot river stones in a pot of water with special herbs layered in the bottom. The patient stands over the pot covered in a cotton tunic as the healer

fans the hot steam. When the water cools, the healer removes the contents of the pot and discovers a variety of objects (nails, sorcery herbs, plastic containers, etc.) that have apparently emerged from the patient's body. The healer converses in detail with the patient about the history of the illness, focusing on social conflicts and possible sorcery suspects. Multiple treatments are usually required, and the healers charge a moderate to considerable fee. The technique of steam-bath healing is open to men and women, is learned from a practitioner for a large fee, and was introduced to the Matsigenka by the neighboring Ashaninka.

Another medical treatment alternative is the government health post. Each full-scale health post (Posta de Salud) is manned by one doctor and two nurses who remain (in theory) for twelve-month stints as part of a required rural service program, making trips to outlying communities for check-ups and vaccinations. Health posts are generally well stocked with pain relievers and antibiotics, though they lack laboratory facilities. There are three health posts in the Urubamba region, serving approximately 25 communities, and two in the upper Madre de Dios serving about 10 communities. Some communities have small village health posts (Posta Sanitaria) manned by regional Peruvian or resident Matsigenka *sanitarios*, health care workers with basic training who receive a small government salary and minimal medical supplies. Native health promoters (*promotor de salud*) work on a volunteer basis, sometimes combining biomedical with traditional healing methods. Health posts are largely underutilized because of the urban-educated professionals' typically paternalistic views, begrudging attitude, and poor communication with community members. Few complete the full twelvemonth stint, leaving lesser-trained regional nurses, *sanitarios*, or *promotores* in charge for extended periods of time.

# **CLASSIFICATION OF ILLNESS, THEORIES OF ILLNESS, AND TREATMENT OF ILLNESS**

#### **Classification of Illness**

The Matsigenka distinguish and classify illness according to a number of criteria: symptoms, body part/organ system affected, acuteness, duration, and population at risk (see Table 1). Other salient criteria include external (visible) versus internal (invisible) pathology, native versus foreign origin, and natural versus supernatural causes. Some illness terms correspond with Western categories such as leishmaniasis (*tsirivaito*), colds and flu (*merentsi*), malaria (*mogekari*), and measles/pox diseases (*saarontsi*). Other syndromes rely on culturally particular understandings of illness and etiology that are not translatable into biomedical terms. A simple sorting exercise resulted in the following general classification scheme: gastrointestinal, gynecological, respiratory, heart and chest conditions, fevers, body pains, ear/eye/dental, animal bites/stings, animal/plant spirit revenge, spirit attack and sorcery, and miscellaneous signs and symptoms (Shepard, 1999a). A great deal of overlap across categories was observed as illustrated in Figure 2. Multidimensional scaling of pile sorts carried out with 43 common illness terms (Izquierdo, 2001) revealed seven illness groups. The low stress (0.135) for the 43 items suggests that people distinguish illness along two major dimensions. We interpret the dimensions as acute and chronic and serious and non-serious. However, these categories often are associated with each other. For example, in some cases, duration and etiology are closely related: and ongoing or chronic illness is generally associated with spiritual etiology (sorcery, spirit attack).

### **Theories of Illness**

The Matsigenka concept of well-being is summarized in the verb *shinetagantsi*, which means to be happy, productive, and well-fed as well as free of illness. Concepts antithetical to well-being include illness (*mantsigarentsi*), suffering (*tsipereagantsi*), thinness or weight loss (*matsatagantsi*), sorrow or worry (*kenkisureagantsi*), anger (*kisatsi*), and soul loss (*gasuretagantsi*). Health and well-being and, conversely, illness and malaise, embrace physical, emotional, and spiritual states as well as harmony (or lack thereof ) in productive, social, and environmental interactions. In the Matsigenka cosmosas-ecosystem, illness, misfortune, and death are often interpreted through the ecological metaphor of predation: just as humans hunt for sustenance, so also demons, illnesses, and dangerous animal spirits look on human beings as game animals (Shepard, 2002c).

Matsigenka theories of illness demonstrate complex notions of etiology and efficacy that challenge Western

dichotomies such as mind/body, individual/society, culture/nature, and natural/supernatural. Pneumatic (see Wilbert, 1986), germ-like, personalistic, and biomedical etiology models are found side by side, as are allopathic, homeopathic ("doctrine of signatures"), and spiritual models of efficacy (Shepard, 1999a). Illness episodes for the Matsigenka are not bounded by time or defined by symptoms. A series of apparently unrelated ailments are, for the Matsigenka, a single, ongoing illness linked by a common cause, often of supernatural origin. Accidental trauma is a frequent problem, but the most severe accidents (snakebite, falling from a high tree) are blamed on

![](_page_7_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 2.** Matsigenka illness classification.

supernatural causes. Even common, self-limiting illnesses may include cosmological or spiritual elements: for example, one type of bee (*yamposhto*) is believed to cause diarrhea by feasting on uneaten food, thereby stealing a piece of the person's soul.

Many illnesses are conceived of as foul vapors that rise from the bowels of the earth where demons reside. They are released into the atmosphere by landslides or earthquakes, causing "yellow vapor in the sky" (*okiterienkatake*), rainbows, and other unusual sky coloration. With rainfall or fog, illness "falls as mist from the sky" (*oparienkatake*), adhering to the skin and entering the body through the nose, mouth, and eyes. This etiology pattern is associated with epidemic and seasonal illnesses (notably *pigarontsi*, apparently yellow fever), and implies a naturalistic, germ-like theory of contagion that is nonetheless linked with cosmological and spiritual notions.

The Matsigenka attribute most acute gastrointestinal conditions to the presence of "worms" (*tsomiri*) in the gut. Though aware of helminthic parasites (also *tsomiri*), the Matsigenka are not necessarily referring to these when they invoke "worm" etiology. Tsomiri is a broader concept, resembling Western germs or microbes, and is also used to explain toothache, earache, conjunctivitis, and various skin infections. Threadlike or like maggots, and so small as to be invisible, tsomiri are found in overripe fruits, spoiled food, and garbage. With poor hygiene, tsomiri enter the skin, ears, eyes, mouth, or gut. In the Urubamba, sexually transmitted diseases are likewise referred to as *tsomiri*.

Certain transitory gastrointestinal, skin, and other conditions (notably food allergies) are attributed to the improper mixing of foods (*tamampegagantsi*). Tapir should not be eaten with armored catfish (*etari*) to avoid scabies, characterized by dry, scaly skin like *etari*. Eating

#### Classification of Illness, Theories of Illness, and Treatment of Illness

carnivorous fish such as piranha with other meats causes bloody diarrhea. These beliefs are closely associated with the concept of revenge (*pugasetagantsi*) by plant and animal spirits. Strong-smelling, carnivorous, and other salient fish and game species are said to have vengeful spirits that attack young children if either parent eats their meat. (The notion implies the existence of a shared "social body" that transcends individual body boundaries.) Vengeful spirits frighten or steal the soul (yagasuretakeri) of children, causing a wide range of illnesses including colic, restlessness, rashes, nosebleed, and sudden death. Children are painted with red dye on the face and crown of the head, the portal of the soul, to dispel harmful spirits. Plants with noxious, toxic, or other symbolically dangerous properties can also take revenge. It is impossible to separate spiritual from empirical aspects of these beliefs, since the spirit or soul (*suretsi*) of an organism encompasses supernatural as well as nutritional, toxic, or medicinal properties.

Many conditions, especially those associated with emotional disturbances, affect the heart. Death occurs when illness "grips the heart" (avitantake negiku). Heart palpitations, (*tsaronegitagantsi*, "fear in the heart") can be caused by bad dreams, sadness, gossip, unrequited love,

sorcery, or a love potion gone awry. Katsinegitagantsi, "heart pain," combines in a single category a number of symptoms that in English would be described separately as "heartburn," "heartache," heart palpitations, anxiety, chest pain, pneumonia, and heart attack (Shepard, 2002a).

The Matsigenka are especially fearful of apparitions of demons (kamagarini) and ghosts (kamatsiri), believed to cause among the most severe illnesses. Dreaming (kisanitagantsi) about the ghost of a close family member causes fever, headache, and body pain, not necessarily life-threatening as long as treatment is undertaken. Dreaming in general for the Matsigenka involves a vulnerable state where the soul wanders and may encounter dangerous spirits or omens of illness and misfortune. Seeing a ghost while awake, tsavitetagantsi ("to see something that later vanishes") is the most serious illness recognized by the Matsigenka, leading to almost certain death. The Matsigenka believe that the deer (*maniro*) is a demonic seducer who appears as an alluring member of the opposite sex to a person walking alone in the forest or in a garden. The seducer offers food and entices the victim to have intercourse. Those who fall victim to the temptation suffer severe illness (fever, chills, body aches) or death, and those who resist must tell no one of the

encounter for three days and take numerous precautionary measures and remedies. Paralysis or sudden death in old people is attributed to assault by the deer demon: *otingarantira maniro*, "broken by the deer." People who are ill or at vulnerable junctions in the life cycle do not eat deer meat, and some people avoid it altogether.

Whereas predatory demons, animal spirits, and ghosts were blamed for inexplicable illnesses in the past, sorcery is frequently invoked in Westernized communities. Footprint sorcery (*gagitagantsi*) is carried out by collecting dried bits of mud from the victim's footprint and boiling them with special herbs, causing the victims leg to swell, become tingling or numb (*ampasetagantsi*), and turn black as if burned (*shinkogitagantsi*). The Matsigenka believe that love magic (*posanga*) is a kind of sorcery brought by outsiders, causing physical–emotional symptoms in its victims (dizziness, heart palpitations, sadness, insanity), as well as infidelity and social strife in the community. Sorcery accusations are often aimed at those same groups of outsiders (Ashaninka, Piro, Shipibo) who served as intermediaries for Western economic interests throughout the 20th century. However, in increasing numbers other fellow Matsigenka are being accused and identified as sorcerers. Ethnically diverse communities and mission towns are thought to be especially dangerous, and Matsigenka who have lived among them are prime sorcery suspects. Thus sorcery theories reflect Matsigenka constructions of interethnic relations and notions of culture change (Izquierdo & Johnson, 2003).

### **Treatment of Illness**

Treatment decisions often relate as much to social dynamics as to the choice of the appropriate remedy, and may involve self or family care, consultation with kin, informal networks, local healers, and medical personnel. The Matsigenka incorporate biomedical and local knowledge in assessing health care options. Some 300 species of medicinal plants—mostly primary forest shrubs and herbs but including some cultivated plants and weeds were identified in an ethnobotanical survey of seven communities (Shepard, 1999a), and the average informant knows 80 or more species (Izquierdo, 2001). Medicinal plant knowledge is widely shared, though a degree of specialization is found along gender lines: women are more knowledgeable about plants for child care and fertility control, while men specialize in hunting medicines and treatments for wounds and snakebite.

Medicinal plants are attributed sensory properties (taste, odor, color, etc.) that are directly related to notions of etiology and efficacy (Shepard, 2002b). Plant extracts are administered as herbal infusions, eye drops, inhalants, poultices, or warm baths. Bitter medicines are administered externally for skin conditions or internally for gastrointestinal conditions in order to "embitter," hurt, and expel the "worm" pathogens, a clearly allopathic model of efficacy. Fragrant plants are used to repel the foul odor of demons, ghosts, and vengeful animal spirits, or to undo the "intoxicating fragrance" of love potions. Painful eyedrops are used to improve a man's aim while hunting and to dispel ghosts, headache, sadness, or social strife.

Medicinal plants appear to be somewhat effective in addressing many common health problems, notably gastrointestinal and skin conditions, broken bones, snakebite, and other hazards of the forest. Hunting medicines, some of which may have tonic or stimulating properties, reflect the uncertainty and importance of game animals in the diet. Core Matsigenka values throughout the life cycle are reflected in plant medicines used to treat excessive crying in babies, promote weight gain, instill desired personality traits in children (industriousness, honesty), give young men good eyesight for hunting, improve garden productivity, make women attentive and careful at spinning and weaving, and reign in dangerous emotional excesses such as anger, grief, and passion.

The health post is an important treatment alternative, especially for illnesses deemed to be of mundane or foreign origin. Visits to the health post show apparent group differences across gender and age (Figures 4 and 5). Boys under five are taken to the health post twice as often as girls while among teenagers, the number of visits by girls increases, likely for gynecological inquiries. Among the middle-aged and elderly, females are much more frequent visitors. Several older men said they had never been to the health post because it was "a place for dying." In all age groups, respiratory and digestive problems were most frequently reported. Nonetheless, it is difficult to capture actual disease incidence because record keeping is not reliable, and because of the complexities of local diagnostic categories and treatment options.

Patients consult a traditional healer when specific symptoms or ongoing illness signals sorcery or spirit attack. Still, those who seek healers may continue using multiple other approaches (medicinal plants, dietary restrictions) to cover all possible vulnerabilities. In narrative accounts of such illnesses, the Matsigenka revealed

a great deal about bodily, emotional, and social distress in communities undergoing cultural and economic change (Izquierdo, 2001).

Despite Strongin's (1982) prediction, biomedicine has not replaced traditional medicine. More than just a therapeutic alternative, traditional healing is an expression of indigenous religion, values, and world-view. Not only do local therapies provide cultural and moral meaning to illness, they also function very effectively in alleviating symptoms.

# **SEXUALITY AND REPRODUCTION**

Although typically sex-positive in their orientation, Amazonian societies reveal an undercurrent of ambiguity regarding the dangers posed by improper sexual relations (Gregor, 1985). Incest for the Matsigenka is among the most shameful offenses, and is thought to result in punishment for the perpetrators as well as the offspring, who show physical deformities and moral perversions. Several Matsigenka myths relate mother–son, father–daughter, and brother–sister incest, which all result in exile or death (Johnson, 2002). Other tales tell of the tragicomic outcomes of sexual relations between humans and animals. Demons including the deer (*maniro*) are hypersexual, have gigantic genitalia, and engage in perversions such as anal sex, thereby causing severe illness or death in their victims.

Hunting lore includes a series of sexual and behavioral taboos that establish an ethic of proper conduct between husband and wife, and depict a balance between reproductive and productive responsibilities of the family. Matsigenka men avoid sexual relations the night before hunting. Contact with menstrual blood, said to smell like carrion or raw meat, takes away a man's hunting skill, as does eating raw meat or improperly cooked food. Taboo violations accumulate in the hunter's body/soul, making him smell of carrion like the vulture and thus lose his aim. A man restores his aim by using hunting medicines taken as emetics, purgatives, or as painful drops in the eyes. Notable are the *ivenkiki*, cultivated varieties of sedge (*Cyperus* sp.).

Sedge varieties cultivated by women are used to control fertility. Depending on the variety and dosage, sedges are said to temporarily or permanently lower fertility, induce abortions, facilitate difficult childbirth, or reduce postpartum bleeding. Cultivated sedges have been found to host fungal parasites that produce ergot alkaloids (Plowman et al., 1990), whose physiological activity is consistent with many Matsigenka uses of sedge (fertility, headache, tonic, wounds).

Decisions about fertility are generally left to women. Women who want to terminate a pregnancy may prepare an herbal abortifacient or ask an experienced older women to do so. There is no stigma attached to abortion practices, though improper use is very dangerous. Western birth control is now available in some communities, though use is not yet widespread. Though the reasons are not clear, a significant change in average family size occurred in the late 1960s, from 6.7 in 1965 to 4.7 in 1972 (Strongin, 1982), and remaining at 5.1 in 1998 (Izquierdo, 2001). Sexually transmitted diseases were first brought to the Urubamba region during petrochemical exploration by Shell Oil in the early 1980s.

# **HEALTH THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE**

### **Pregnancy and Birth**

Pregnancy and childbirth are a special source of concern. Expectant parents avoid a wide range of vengeful fish and game species, notably carnivorous fish. Expectant fathers are prohibited from manufacturing arrows: cutting bamboo is thought to cause uterine hemorrhage, and sticky arrow-fletching resin (*taviri*) causes retained placenta. Parents avoid specific foods and behaviors believed to result in unwanted physical as well as personality traits (anger, laziness) in the developing fetus.

Traditionally, births were attended by elder female relatives but in many communities today, midwives are chosen based on experience and given basic training by the medical personnel. Women give birth in a squatting position, gripping a vertical support such as a house post. Birthing in the health post—prone and surrounded by lights, instruments, and strangers—is viewed as unattractive and frightening.

The immediate concern upon birth is the passing of the placenta and the cutting of the umbilical cord. Medicinal plants are used to aid in the passing of the placenta (*iranonta*) to avoid dangerous complications. Traditionally, the umbilical cord is cut with a grass-like bamboo with razor edges (*tiposhi*). Metal implements are now used, though improper hygiene has been known to cause tetanus. The cut cord is treated with arrow- fletching resin (*taviri*) and other "umbilical cord plants" (*shirimogutopini*), or Western antiseptics when available. The mother and baby are washed in warm water and herbs. Both the placenta and later, the umbilical cord are buried to avoid contact with carrion animals or evil spirits.

#### **Infancy**

The time between birth and the falling of the umbilical cord is especially dangerous. Both parents remain indoors and follow strict dietary and behavioral restrictions. Through the first few months of life, parents maintain certain restrictions to avoid mishaps and illness in their infants. Strong-smelling and carnivorous fish and game are avoided because of their vengeful spirits, as are urticating or caustic plants, thought to cause rashes in newborns. To dispel vengeful spirits, the mother bathes the baby daily (once or more times) in warm herbal mixtures including sedges as well as fragrant, viscous, and colorful plants. In addition to their role in hygiene, these practices reflect the general anxiety of parents about newborns in a setting where infant mortality is considerable.

Quickly, the couple must return to the productive routines of daily life to provide a good example and prevent the child from growing up lazy or inactive. Babies are carried at all times by their mothers in a woven cotton sling (*tsagompirentsi*), nursing on demand. Babies

and young children share bedding in close contact with both parents. Mothers masticate boiled manioc and feed it mouth-to-mouth (*aviakeri*) to infants as young as 3 months to facilitate weight gain. Sweet or tart herbs are sometimes mixed with this mash to stimulate appetite. Broth, and later meat of bland, non-vengeful fish and game, is introduced soon thereafter. Babies are breast-fed an average of 2 years, and may be weaned using chili pepper if they insist on nursing beyond that time.

#### **Childhood**

Diarrhea, especially when combined with vomiting, quickly dehydrates infants and young children, and is a frequent cause of death in this age category. Increasingly, health workers are teaching oral rehydration therapy. The extended abdomen visible in most children and many adults is evidence for a moderate, practically normative parasite load. Extreme parasite loads are known to cause anemia and even life-threatening intestinal blockage, especially in children. *Ficus* latex is a common and effective folk remedy for intestinal worms, though some Matsigenka fear the powerful purgative properties of an improper dose. (Matsigenka men's use of purgative and emetic plants may also help reduce parasite loads.) Pharmaceutical antihelminthic treatments are distributed with increasing frequency, however without sanitation and potable water, reinfection is rapid.

Mothers are the main care providers for small infants, though fathers come to take on an important role in education and discipline in later childhood. Socialization of appropriate emotions as well as competence, autonomy, and sociability is a strong focus even in infancy. Children are cherished and protected by an ever-present network of family members. However, once children have gained a strong footing, they are given great freedom. Children learn from a young age to participate in subsistence activities. Young girls help their mothers in cooking, cleaning, childcare, and gardening, while boys roam a bit more freely, playing at hunting, fishing, building shelters, and making fires.

Children may be given a series of herbal treatments to ensure fast growth, protection from illness, and positive behavioral traits (honesty, industriousness, emotional control) in later life. Children are also taught to show respect toward particular animals and plants, because mocking, handling, or bothering them may provoke spirit revenge. Children are taught to control their expressions of pain and other negative emotions, leading to a marked stoicism among Matsigenka adults.

#### **Adolescence**

By about age 15, children should be proficient in subsistence responsibilities and know right from wrong. Adolescents who act inappropriately are publicly humiliated and punished. Stealing is considered a serious offense. Adolescents are also punished for bullying, laziness, and overly precocious sexual behavior. Girls are generally permitted to engage in an open sexual relationship at a somewhat younger age than boys, who must first prove their abilities in hunting and gardening. Teenage boys may be given a series of purgatives and eye-stinging remedies to develop their hunting skills. They are not allowed to touch or eat their first several kills, and are taught to avoid bragging about or being selfish with meat, lest they lose their stamina and aim. Teenage girls may learn herbal remedies for learning to spin cotton, gaining weight, having strong and durable teeth, removing pubic hair (considered unaesthetic), or regulating fertility.

Transition into womanhood begins with first menstruation, marked by an extended ritual of seclusion (*oantarotira*, "she becomes an adult") during which the girl lives in a small hut, eats special foods, avoids the sun and the gaze of males, receives special instructions from close female kin, and spins and weaves cotton to produce a tunic for her future husband. She emerges from seclusion after completing the tunic, shaving her head to mark the transition. Her emergence is generally greeted by a manioc beer party held in her honor, during which suitors may express their intentions to her and her parents.

### **Adulthood and Aging**

Adult life is characterized by the extreme self sufficiency of the Matsigenka household and the division of labor between husband and wife. Complementary gender roles are reflected in medical botany: whereas men use emetic and painful plant remedies to improve their hunting skills, women use fragrant herbs to protect children from vengeful game animal spirits. People with deficiencies (e.g., cleft palate, atrophied limb) are not ostracized, and usually engage in a fairly normal economic and social life, sometimes compensating for their deficiency in one area with special skill in another.

Couples remain autonomous in most subsistence activities through middle age and well into old age, and only a very small number of school teachers and health workers receive government pensions. As a man ages and loses his stamina, he tends to leave the more strenuous hunting and garden-felling to a son-in-law, but continues active garden work, fishing, and hunting from blinds. Women, too, remain active and productive through old age. Given the many hazards of life in remote rainforest villages with minimal or non-existent Western medical care, it is surprising that as many Matsigenka make it to old age as they do. The term for old age is *gatavaigetagantsi*, which translates literally as "to be done, to be satisfied after a long life," implying a sense of completion and fulfillment that contrasts with Western notions of old age as decay and decrepitude. The elderly among the Matsigenka are highly respected for their knowledge of medicinal plants, mythology, history, and folklore, and for their entertaining yarns about a past that was more difficult, more treacherous, and more mysterious than life today.

### **Dying and Death**

Life and death for the Matsigenka are not mutually exclusive states. Instead, death belongs at the far end of a continuum of more and more permanent degrees of separation of the soul (*suretsi*) from the body (*ivatsa*). The soul leaves the body through the crown of the head (*vankagantsi*), nostrils, and eyes during illness, sadness, sleep, trance, and unconsciousness (the verb *kamagantsi* means both "to fall unconscious" and "to die"). The soul is a life force that infuses and activates the bodies of humans, animals, and animate beings with growth, appetite, and purposeful action. At variance with Western metaphors, skin and bones, rather than flesh and blood, are considered to be the inert, soulless aspects of the body. Flesh (*ivatsa*), blood, fat, and muscle are physical manifestations of the soul's presence in a healthy body. A person who is extremely emaciated due to illness, sadness, or old age is as good as dead: the soul has already left the body, and all that remains are the lifeless skin and bones. In the past, frail, elderly people who could no longer care for themselves simply walked off alone in the forest, since their souls had departed and they were already as good as dead. The dead were exposed in fetal position in the buttress roots of a large tree or in the floodplain down river from the settlement, though burial has been adopted since missionary contact. Shamans are believed to be immortal, awaking from death to join the benevolent spirits in safeguarding humanity.

Matsigenka mourning practices invert commonsense Western understandings of grief, since it is the dead who grieve for the living (Shepard, 2002a). The living sit in stoic silence while the dead roam in the vicinity of the village for several days, gathering up lost and discarded belongings and seeking loved ones to take as companions to the Land of the Dead. Grief is potentially lethal because the dead are still emotionally attached to the living and capable of stealing their souls to keep as company. Pensiveness, inactivity, and loss of appetite in grief are early signs of soul loss; seeing a ghost in dreams or apparitions is a very dangerous sign, requiring special treatment. The short mourning period (about 3 days) aims at protecting the living from the dangerous attentions of the ghost, speeding it on to the Land of the Dead as quickly as possible. No one wanders far to avoid encountering the ghost, which is feared, shunned, and dehumanized. Family members of the deceased shave their heads, paint their face with red or black dye, burn chili peppers, and may wear the tunic or garments of others, hoping to disguise themselves from the ghost. Often, family members temporarily or permanently abandon the dwelling or residence group where the person died. Crying and overt expressions of grief are strongly repressed. After 3 days, the family slowly returns to normal life, taking warm, medicinal herbal baths and eye-stinging drops to dispel sadness and visions of the ghost.

1. Data from three Matsigenka populations (Sotileja, Yomybato, & Kamisea), organized from least to most acculturated, and two neighboring Panoan-speaking populations, the Yora, contacted forcefully in 1985 and the Chitonahua, contacted forcefully in 1995. Data are taken from extensive genealogical interviews (Shepard 1999a: 105–107), except Kamisea which represents deaths occurring during fieldwork conducted from 1996-1999 (Izquierdo, 2001).
