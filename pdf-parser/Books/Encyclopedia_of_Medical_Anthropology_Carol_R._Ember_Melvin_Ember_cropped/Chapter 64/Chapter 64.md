# **Czechs**

#### **Zdenek Salzmann**

## **ALTERNATIVE NAMES**

The Czechs call their culture *ceská kultura ˇ* (Czech culture). To call it "Bohemian culture" would be misleading because the term "Bohemian" has a historic and geographic rather than an ethnographic or linguistic reference. Furthermore, Bohemia (*Cechy ˇ* ) is only the larger, western part of the Czech Republic; the smaller, eastern part is Moravia (*Morava*). In the north, Moravia includes a part of Silesia (*Slezsko*), a historical region that lies for the most part in southwestern Poland.

# **LOCATION AND LINGUISTIC AFFILIATION**

The Czech Republic, located in central Europe, is bounded by Poland on the north, Germany on the west, Austria on the south, and Slovakia (the Slovak Republic) on the east. The area of the Republic is 78,866 km<sup>2</sup> (about the size of South Carolina).

The language spoken in Bohemia and Moravia is Czech. It is spoken in several regional dialects, but outside their homes most Czechs speak Common Czech, a supraregional variety of the spoken language. Czech, a Slavic language, belongs to the West Slavic subbranch of the Indo-European language family; it is mutually intelligible with the Slovak language.

# **OVERVIEW OF THE CULTURE**

#### **Population**

The population of the Czech Republic as of December 31, 2000, was 10,266,546, with females exceeding males by 273,084. The ethnic composition of the republic is 94.9% Czech, with the remainder consisting of Slovak (3.1%), Polish (0.6%), German (0.5%), Ukrainian (0.4%), and Romany (Gypsy) minorities. Officially the Romany population amounts to 0.3%, but it may be as much as five to ten times larger. Because both the majority populations of Bohemia and Moravia speak Czech, they will be considered as belonging to the Czech ethnic group. When their practices differ, it will be indicated.

#### **History**

The ancestors of contemporary Czechs made the territory of what is now the Czech Republic their home in about the 6th century, replacing a Germanic people who migrated out of the area during the 5th century. In the early part of the 11th century what had become Bohemia and Moravia was brought under one control, becoming the kernel of the Czech state. The first Bohemian king was crowned in 1085, and the royal title became hereditary in 1198.

The peak of the kingdom's influence was reached under Charles IV, who reigned from 1346 until 1378, and in 1355 was also made emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Prague became the seat of the archbishop and the site of the first university in central Europe (1348).

Czech national culture continued its development until 1620 when the Czech estates were defeated by the Hapsburg army in the Battle of White Mountain. Not only was the kingdom's independence lost, but its provinces were declared to be the hereditary property of the Hapsburgs. This loss led to a period referred to as "the darkness" (*temno*), which lasted until the end of the 18th century when, after the onset of national revival, a modern

#### **The Context of Health 623**

Czech national consciousness began to form. Independence was regained at the end of World War I in 1918. From that year until the end of 1992 the Czechs and Slovaks shared a common state, Czechoslovakia, with the exception of the six years of World War II (1939–45). As of January 1, 1993, the Czechs and Slovaks peacefully separated to become two independent countries.

#### **Economy and Occupations**

The Czech Republic is and has long been a highly industrialized country. In 2000, the structure of employment in the civil sector broke down into services (54.9%), industry (40%), and agriculture (5.1%). The unemployment rate in 1999 stood at 8.7%, with the capital Prague experiencing the lowest unemployment, northwestern Bohemia and northeastern Moravia the highest.

Both imports and exports steadily rose over the final decade of the 20th century, with imports invariably exceeding exports, although not by a wide margin. In terms of monies expended, the main imports included (in descending order) machinery and equipment, chemicals and synthetic fibers, motor vehicles and trailers, communications equipment (including radio and television), basic metals, electrical machinery, crude petroleum and natural gas, rubber and plastic products, and fabricated metal products other than machinery.

The main exports included motor vehicles and trailers, machinery and equipment, electrical machinery, fabricated metal products other than machinery, chemicals and synthetic fibers, basic metals, communications equipment, certain nonmetallic mineral products, and rubber and plastic products.

The countries from which most goods are imported (in descending order) are Germany, the Russian Federation, Slovakia, Italy, France, Austria, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland; exports go to Germany, Slovakia, Austria, Poland, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, the United States, and the Netherlands.

The middle class is the largest socioeconomic class of the Czech Republic. Under the communist regime after World War II, the status of manual workers rose and that of the former upper middle class steeply declined. Since the velvet revolution of 1989, when democracy was reestablished, some businesspeople have acquired luxury cars and expensive housing. By contrast, retired people must stretch their pensions to keep pace with the steadily, if slowly, rising cost of living.

#### **Government**

The Czech Republic is a parliamentary democracy with a Chamber of Deputies and a Senate. The President appoints certain high officials (for example, the prime minister) and can veto other than constitutional bills. During the postcommunist times (from 1990 on), several dozen political parties have emerged, and the country has been governed by a coalition of some of those parties receiving the most votes. The results have not always led to an efficient government.

#### **Family and Kinship**

The effective kin group of urban Czechs is limited to the closest relatives. Those less close than grandparents, aunts, uncles, and first cousins usually meet only on such occasions as weddings and funerals, Christmas, or other holiday gatherings. Most villagers, however, especially in Moravia, maintain close contact with more distant relatives.

#### **Religion**

The first half of the 15th century was marked by a breach with the Roman Church as a consequence of the reform movement led by the Czech Jan Hus (John Huss). His death in 1415, when he was burned at the stake in Constance (Konstanz in southern Germany), initiated the ambivalent attitude of the Czechs toward Roman Catholicism; this ambivalence was later reinforced by the attempt at forcible re-Catholization begun during the 17th century by the Hapsburg rulers. More recently, the 41 years of communist rule (1948–89) undermined the observance of religious practices even further.

At present, about 40% of the population are Roman Catholic, about 4% Protestant, and the remaining 56% uncommitted, atheist, or agnostic. Compared with the people of Moravia, the Czechs of Bohemia tend to be lukewarm in their religious beliefs and practices.

# **THE CONTEXT OF HEALTH: ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL FACTORS**

#### **Demographic Data**

At present, the population of the Czech Republic is becoming smaller due to natural decrease. The year 2000 was the seventh consecutive year in which the number of deaths exceeded the number of births. Because of the low number of births, the average age of the population has been slowly increasing. In 2000, 53% of the population was below the age of 40 and 47% above.

Life expectancy at birth in 1999 was 71.4 years for men and 78.1 for women. On reaching the age of 65, an additional 13.7 years is added for men and 17 for women. Among 24 European countries, life expectancy in the republic ranked seventh from the bottom.

The number of live births per 1,000 inhabitants stood at 19.1 in 1975. The number has been decreasing in recent years, from 135,881 in 1985 to 90,910 in 2000. During 1999, when there were only 8.7 live births per 1,000 inhabitants, the number was the third lowest among 24 European countries.

There were 49.24 abortions per 100 births in 2000; of these 12.03 were spontaneous, 35.68 legally induced, and 1.53 for other reasons (primarily the result of ectopic pregnancies). The number of abortions in 2000 was lower by 9.1% than in 1999 and less than half of what it was in 1990.

The rate of death for infants younger than one year per 1,000 live births was 4.1 in 2000. In a comparison with 24 other European countries, only four had a rate lower, nine had the same rate, and 11 a higher rate than in the Czech Republic.

The marriage rate in the Czech Republic dropped to a historical minimum during the late 1990s, and by 2000 only 5.4 marriages took place per 1,000 inhabitants. This low number of marriages has resulted in part from the steadily increasing age at first marriage, which at the beginning of the new millennium was approaching that recorded for Western Europe. And just as in many parts of the world today, a man and woman frequently live together for several years before deciding to legalize their cohabitation.

Since the early part of the 20th century, the choice of a spouse has been the decision of the young couple, but educational attainments and the likely socioeconomic status of a potential husband or wife are of some importance. Whenever possible, the young married couple establish a neolocal residence, that is, a residence independent of the family of either one. However, the help of the husband's or wife's mother is sought and appreciated at the arrival of a child, particularly if the mother expects to return to a job.

### **Environmental Pollution**

Before 1990, protection of the environment was subordinated to the fulfillment of economic five-year plans. Lack of proper control over the sources of pollution caused increasingly serious problems for the population. Over 50% of forests were damaged, particularly spruce forests in the mountains along the Bohemian border. Of some 7,000 km (about 4,350 miles) of monitored streams, 60% were judged to be strongly or very strongly contaminated. Especially critical conditions existed in northwestern Bohemia around the towns of Most and Sokolov, both of which had large deposits of lignite and a variety of industrial enterprises. Altogether, about 2.5 million people were living in a substantially endangered environment.

Matters have greatly improved since 1990: for example, solid emissions decreased from 401,500 metric tons in 1990 to 16,100 in 1999; from 1,596,000 tons of sulfur dioxide in 1990 to 193,100 in 1999; from 493,900 tons of oxides of nitrogen in 1990 to 135,000 in 1999; and from 23,800 tons of hydrocarbons in 1990 to 17,700 in 1999. Only the amount of carbon monoxide has increased during that period, by about 50%; this increase parallels the increase in passenger and commercial automobiles.

Similar improvement is being achieved in the case of pollutants discharged into watercourses: for example, from 190,500 tons of undissolved substances in 1990 to 29,758 tons in 2000, and from 989,057 tons of dissolved inorganic salts in 1990 to 691,613 tons in 2000. The one remaining problem is the prevention of pollution from the disposal of the ever-growing amounts of toxic waste.

### **Diet**

By American standards, traditional Czech food would be considered heavy and fat. Portions of meat served are not large, but potatoes or dumplings and substantial amounts of animal fats (lard, butter, and cream) are used both in gravies and in general cooking. Eaten as often as bread and butter is bread covered with lard rendered from pork fat (with cracklings) or with goose grease (and goose liver). Only since the 1990s have salad vegetables been available on a year-round basis; when out of season locally, fresh vegetables are now imported.

During 1999, consumption of the main types of food was as follows (amounts given are per person): pork 44.7 kg, poultry 20.5 kg, beef 13.8 kg, fish 5.2 kg, fats and oils 23.1 kg, lard and bacon 5 kg, butter 4 kg, fresh vegetables 85.3 kg, fresh fruit 75.6 kg, and potatoes 75.9 kg (1 kg-2.2046 1b). However, during the final two decades of the last century vegetable shortenings, oils, and margarine began to replace animal fats. Despite some of the desirable changes in the basic diet, obesity is quite

#### **The Context of Health 625**

common because the current wide ownership and use of personal automobiles tends to offset some of the trends toward consumption of a more healthful diet.

Beer is the favorite beverage of Czech men (and many women) and its consumption in 1999 amounted to 160 l per person (1 l-1.057 quarts). Wine and spirits are also drunk, but beer is the drink of choice. Breweries are plentiful and beer is relatively inexpensive.

#### **Health Infrastructure**

The physical resources required for health care stabilized during the last three years of the 20th century. The network of establishments for inpatient care included 211 hospitals with 67,457 beds (including 2,304 cots for newborns), 160 specialized therapeutic centers with 22,667 beds, and 63 health-spa centers with 22,179 beds. The total number of inpatient beds per 10,000 inhabitants was 109.4 and has been slowly decreasing despite the fact that the number of hospitalized patients in 2000 showed a 0.5% increase over 1999.

The number of pharmaceutical service establishments has been growing rapidly since 1990, replacing most of the earlier dispensaries (for example, an additional 80 pharmacies were established during 2000). While in 1990 all of the 917 pharmacies and 1,216 dispensaries were stateowned, in 2000 only slightly more than 4% of the 1,706 pharmacies and none of the 183 dispensaries was owned by the state.

### **Health Insurance and Medical Expenses**

According to currently valid laws, all persons who permanently reside in the Czech Republic, as well as persons who are not permanent residents but whose employer is located in the republic, have health insurance. The insurance is paid either by the insured (one third) and the employer (two thirds) or by the state. Self-employed persons (and others who qualify as such) pay their own premiums. The state pays for all those who for one reason or another do not belong to either of the above two categories—for example, women on maternity leave, physically or mentally disadvantaged people, soldiers, and others.

Health insurance pays for all legitimate care extended to patients to maintain or improve their health. These services include ambulance transportation, emergency service, preventive care, hospital stay, balneological care, prescribed medicines, standard immunizations, and autopsy. Limitations and exclusions concerning the services provided by the health insurance plan are relatively few and reasonable.

Health care is financed partly from public resources and partly by individuals. Public expenditures for health in 2000 through the Ministry of Health amounted to 129.6 billion Czech crowns (Kˇc)—5% more than in 1999. The contribution from the state budget was 11%, while 89% was contributed by health insurance corporations, of which in 2000 there were nine. Amounts spent by individuals on health care have been steadily growing—from 5.282 billion Kˇc in 1994 to 12.245 billion Kˇc in 2000 (that is, from 511 Kˇc per person in 1994 to 1,192 Kˇc in 2000).

Significant among expenses for health care are medicines; such expenses almost tripled between 1993 and 2000. The most commonly dispensed medicines can be characterized as follows (the parenthetic percentages indicate the relative share of funds spent on them): for problems of the cardiovascular system (19.9%), of the digestive tract (13.2%), of the nervous system (11.8%), of the respiratory system (8.8%), to inhibit or prevent the growth and spread of neoplasms or malignant cells (8.6%), for antibiotics and chemotherapeutics (8.4%), for problems of the blood and blood-forming organs (7.3%), of the genitourinary system (6.1%), and of the musculoskeletal system (6%).

Compared with 18 other European countries the Czech Republic ranked sixth lowest in the percentage of gross national product spent on health services.

#### **Domestic Abuse**

According to the report of one among several agencies offering assistance to victims of domestic violence, out of 624 telephone calls received between September 4 and November 11, 2001, the victim was a woman in 538 calls, a child in 56 calls, and a man in 30 calls. Children were present when the violence took place in 239 cases. Both physical and psychological abuse occurred in 319 cases, psychological abuse in 127, physical abuse in 83, and sexual abuse in 16. According to a foundation concerned with children, during 2001 the most frequent forms of child abuse were infliction of pain, sexual abuse (both commonly under the influence of alcohol), forcing the child out of the family, and neglect.

Numbers of cases concerning child abuse and domestic abuse in general are never accurate because many instances of abuse are not reported. The data that follow must therefore be viewed only as illustrative. According to one particular public survey, 13% of those questioned stated that they had been victims of a partner's violence, while 3% of those surveyed admitted to taking the role of aggressor, yielding a total of 16% of instances of domestic abuse. According to specialists, however, the figure of 13–16% represents only the lower limit of incidents of abuse. The actual rate of domestic violence is thought to be much higher.

Another organization offering help to abused individuals provided the following data (which must also be considered tentative): female victims of abuse fall primarily in the age ranges (in descending order) of 40–44, 45–49, 30–34, 35–39, and 25–29; most of the males who commit abuse are in the age ranges of 45–49 and 35–39. As to educational background, most female victims and men who abuse them had completed secondary schooling; the least violence was reported for those with only basic education.

# **MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS**

#### **Training of Medical Personnel**

The training and education of future members of occupations related to the practice of medicine, pharmacy, and certain types of health services have been proceeding without problems. During the 2000–01 academic year, students of medicine numbered 8,251 (of whom 4,637 were women), of pharmacy 1,655 (1,280 women), and of types of health services requiring university training 3,383 (3,039 women). The numbers of graduates at the end of the 1999–2000 academic year were, respectively, 912, 254, and 665. At present, seven medical schools of three universities train physicians, two pharmaceutical schools at two universities train pharmacists, and two schools of social health at two universities train personnel for work in health and social care positions.

Paramedical schools in the academic year 2000–01 enrolled 26,301 students, of whom 3,405 attended evening courses.

#### **Types of Medical Personnel**

As of December 31, 2000, there were 39,342 (38,331 full-time equivalent) physicians serving the population of the Czech Republic. Of these, 22,212 were women. The number of physicians per 1,000 inhabitants was 3.8. All specializations are represented; most numerous were physicians in the following branches of medicine (listed here in descending order): dentistry and dental surgery, general medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, surgery, gynecology and obstetrics, anesthesiology, neurology, X-ray diagnostics, psychiatry, and ophthalmology. As of the same date, pharmacists numbered 5,191 (4,726 fulltime equivalent), of whom 4,256 were women.

According to the latest survey conducted by the Center for the Study of Public Opinion, physicians enjoy the highest prestige among the 27 occupations listed. Their average income, however, rates only twelfth.

The full-time equivalent of paramedical personnel (that is, nurses, children's nurses, midwives, dieticians, rehabilitation workers, assistants in hygienic services, medical and pharmaceutical laboratory assistants, radiological technicians, and dental technicians numbered 107,321 in 2000; of this total, 64,450 were nurses (about 60%). Of the paramedical personnel, 54.3% worked in hospitals (including hospital outpatient care) and 28.2% in independent establishments giving outpatient care.

The number of full-time equivalent lowest-tier health personnel (auxiliary nurses, disinfectors, dental assistants, and others) came to 6,537.

#### **Alternative Medicine**

Although the biomedical approach has been accepted and employed throughout the 20th century in the region, until World War II some individuals in villages and small towns preferred to consult herbalists (folk healers) and use the recommended infusions, decoctions, or ointments made from various herbs. Consulting herbalists was not approved of during the communist era (1948–89). During the last 10 years (since the early 1990s) folk medicine has again become popular. It is practiced nonprofessionally and usually involves the use of plant-derived remedies on an empirical basis. To prevent some illnesses or to cure them, herbalists as well as many physicians recommend carefully watching one's diet, exercising, and using herbs and other natural remedies, both domestic and imported. Many patients of physicians also consult herbalists.

### **Balneology**

Balneological institutions—that is, health spas making use of thermal mineral waters and mud or peat baths—are numerous and popular. Some of these have been known for centuries and have become internationally renowned. Members of the European aristocracy and famous individuals (for example, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe) visited them on a regular basis. Among the best known are Karlovy Vary (Karlsbad) for gastroenterological and metabolic problems; Mariánské Láznˇe (Marienbad) for urological and orthopedic problems and for allergies; Frantiˇskovy Láznˇe for gynecological, circulatory, and orthopedic problems; and Luhaˇcovice for gastrointestinal, metabolic, and endocrinological problems. These and other health spas are visited not only by Czech citizens but by thousands of foreigners.

# **CLASSIFICATION OF ILLNESS, THEORIES OF ILLNESS, AND TREATMENT OF ILLNESS**

#### **Medicinal Drugs**

The biomedical approach to the diagnosis and treatment of illness has been accepted in the Czech Republic as long as it has been in other industrial countries of Europe. Furthermore, Czech medicine has always made every effort to keep up with modern advances in the treatment of illness.

During the first half of the 20th century extensive use of medicinal plants listed in Czech pharmacopeias was progressively replaced by the use of synthetic drugs. The pharmaceutical industry of the country has always been strong, but medications manufactured elsewhere are also prescribed and available in pharmacies.

The importation of medicinal drugs in 1999 and 2000 exceeded export by about 7,000 metric tons. The countries from which most of these drugs were imported are (in descending order) Germany, Slovakia, United Kingdom, Italy, Austria, and Slovenia; exports went primarily to Slovakia, Germany, Russian Federation, Poland, Austria, and Ukraine.

#### **Diseases**

Infectious diseases must be made known to the authorities. The most important infectious diseases reported during 2000 are listed in Table 1. Compared with 1990, increases in incidence occurred only for salmonellosis other than typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever B, whooping cough, viral encephalitis, syphilis, and AIDS.

**Table 1.** Infectious Diseases Reported to Authorities in 2000

| Disease                                      | Number of cases |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Salmonellosis (other than typhoid fever      |                 |

| Viral encephalitis                           | 719             |
| Bacillary dysentery (shigellosis)            | 548             |
| Whooping cough                               | 395             |
| Bacterial meningitis                         | 227             |
| Other types of tuberculosis                  | 198             |
| AIDS (of which 14 were newly reported cases) | 148             |
| Mumps                                        | 120             |
| Measles                                      | 9               |
| Paratyphoid fever B                          | 1               |

Of the noninfectious diseases, diabetes is quite widespread and gaining. In 2000 about 650,000 diabetics were under treatment, with females exceeding males by about 60,000. To put it differently, there were well over 12,000 diabetics under treatment for every 100,000 inhabitants of the Czech Republic—more than one in every ten persons.

The incidence of malignant neoplasms (tumors) rose steadily over the last 40 years of the 20th century while the rate of mortality from this cause over the past thirty years has remained virtually the same in men and has risen only slightly in women. During 1999, the most common malignancies in men were (in descending order) those of the skin, bronchi and lungs, prostate, colon, bladder, kidney, rectum, and stomach; in women those of the skin, breast, colon, uterus, bronchi and lungs, ovaries, and cervix. Compared with 30 other European countries, the standardized mortality rate for malignant tumors in the Czech Republic was the fourth highest for men and the third highest for women.

During 2000, the most common causes of death for both males and females were (in descending order) diseases of the circulatory system, neoplasms, external causes (injuries and poisoning), diseases of the respiratory system, and diseases of the digestive system.

#### **Mental Illness**

Over two million (2,057,952) psychiatric examinations took place during 2000; they concerned 361,931 patients (or a total of 3,523 first examinations, that is, new patients, per 100,000 inhabitants)—not a small number. Neurotic disorders were most common; they were followed (in descending order) by affective (emotional) disorders, schizophrenia, organic mental disorders, personality disorders due to use of alcohol, developmental disorders during childhood and adolescence, and mental retardation.

#### **Preventive Measures**

The General Health Insurance Company of the Czech Republic pays for preventive examinations as follows: for men and women by a general practitioner once every two years; for women 15 and older by a gynecologist once a year; for pregnant women once a month by an obstetrician; for individuals under 18 by a dentist twice a year; for pregnant women by a dentist twice during pregnancy; and for persons older than 18 by a dentist once a year.

Required protection of children from transmissible diseases includes immunizations against tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough, mumps, rubella, measles, polio, and tuberculosis; some of these immunizations are combined. Recommended immunizations are those against hepatitis B, hemophilia, tick-borne encephalitis, and other conditions.

## **SEXUALITY AND REPRODUCTION**

Most young people feel relatively free to engage in sexual activity. While the fertility rate (the number of live-born children per 1,000 females of a given age) for women 15–19 was 44.7 in 1990, it fell to 13.2 in 2000. Because the number of induced abortions during the same period fell to only 31.1% of the induced abortions in 1990, it can be assumed that methods of contraception are being used more, and more effectively. Still, out of 90,910 live births in 2000, 19,792 (that is, 21.8%) were to single mothers.

The population of the republic has shown natural decrease over the last eight years. The size of a nuclear family averages between three and four members, but some couples have no children, and devoutly religious parents usually have three or four.

# **HEALTH THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE**

### **Pregnancy and Birth**

Pregnancy is a condition that can be ended by legal abortion. It must therefore be assumed that pregnant women have chosen to bear a child. Whenever possible—in an overwhelming number of cases—children are born in hospitals. Under normal circumstances, mother and baby remain under hospital care for three days. Healthy infants are seen by a pediatrician once a month during the first six months, and then every other month until the end of the first year.

#### **Infancy**

Most babies are bottle-fed, but some mothers nurse their babies. Breast-feeding of children up to 3 months of age decreased between 1996 and 2000 from 32.85% to 24.15%. Over the same period of time, the rate of breastfeeding of children older than 3 months increased from 24.3% to 31.07%. Some mothers swaddle infants, continuing a practice very common two generations ago. They believe that swaddling will calm their children.

Much attention is given to children for the first two years. For example, it is customary to take small children outdoors every day in prams or strollers. At about age 2 or 3, some children are sent to day nurseries (crèches), and a year or two later to kindergarten. The number of kindergartens fell from 7,335 in 1990–91 to 5,776 in 2000–01 as did the number of children attending them, from 352,139 to 279,838.
