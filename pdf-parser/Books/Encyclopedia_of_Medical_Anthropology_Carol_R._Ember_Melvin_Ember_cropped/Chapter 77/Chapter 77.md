# **ALTERNATIVE NAMES**

The Iroquois were and are a confederacy of several Native North American nations. The original five members of the confederacy were the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca. Accordingly, they were known to English colonial officials as the Five Nations. When the Tuscarora joined them early in the 18th century, they became the Six Nations. The Iroquois saw their confederacy as a metaphorical longhouse, the multifamily dwelling which housed them in settlements at the time of contact with Europeans. Hence they referred to themselves as the Hodénosaunee, meaning, roughly, People of the Longhouse. French colonists in Canada used the term Iroquois, a name they probably learned from a 16th century Basque–Algonquian pidgin used in the St. Lawrence valley (see Bakker, 1990; Goddard, 1978).

# **LOCATION AND LINGUISTIC AFFILIATION**

Iroquois territory stretched through what is now upstate New York from the Mohawk River valley to that of the Genesee. The Mohawks lived in the Mohawk valley; the Oneidas lived near Oneida Lake; Onondaga territory was lands surrounding present-day Syracuse, New York; the Cayugas lived near Lake Cayuga; and the Senecas occupied lands to the west. In historic times there was an expansion westward and the Iroquois claimed as hunting territories lands now in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Ontario. In the late 17th century Mohawks who had been converted to Christianity by French Jesuits moved north to the St. Lawrence valley where they remain in communities in Quebec, New York, and Ontario.

Following the American Revolution, a large portion of those Iroquois who had fought as allies to the Crown moved to lands in Ontario. Others remained in New York, the Onondagas with a reservation near Syracuse and the Senecas currently living on three reservations in western New York. The Oneidas, who had fought as allies to the rebellious Americans, initially remained in their homeland, but in the early 19th century emigrated in large numbers to both Wisconsin (near Green Bay) and Ontario (near London). The Tuscaroras moved northward from South Carolina to reside in the Iroquois country about 1720, and now occupy a reservation near Niagara Falls, New York. Some Iroquois who had settled in Ohio eventually were established on a reservation in Oklahoma (Campisi, 1978; Fenton & Tooker, 1978; Sturtevant, 1978; Tooker, 1978a). Table 1 lists the many contemporary Iroquois reservations and reserves and their enrolled memberships. However, a large portion of those enrolled live off-reservation or off-reserve and the residents of a reservation or reserve include many not officially enrolled as tribal or band members.

The nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, as well as neighboring, politically independent groups such as the Huron, spoke languages of the northern branch of the Iroquoian language family. A single language, Cherokee, survives in the Iroquoian language family's southern branch. Of northern Iroquoian languages, Tuscarora is the most divergent. Mohawk and Oneida are the most closely

These figures reflect the enrolled or registered membership of the above communities in or about 1990 for the United States and 2000 for Canada. Many enrolled members live offreservation or off-reserve. The reserves and reservations also are home to many non-enrolled individuals, Indian and non-Indian, who have married into or otherwise have a right to reside on the reserve or reservation.

# **OVERVIEW OF THE CULTURE**

The Iroquois lived in compact villages usually located in defensible positions near water sources, ranging in size from approximately 500 persons up to 3,000 or possibly even more. Typically surrounded by palisades, a village consisted of parallel rows of longhouses, each elm-bark and pole structure housing a number of

matrilineally related women with their spouses and unmarried children. Open hearths were spaced about 8 m apart in the central aisle running the length of the house. Each was shared by two families, and the usual longhouse at time of contact had three or four hearths, hence housing six to eight families (Abler, 1970).

Surrounding the village were its agricultural fields that provided the larger portion of the Iroquois diet. Here grew what the Iroquois referred to as the "life-supporters" or the "three sisters"—maize (corn), beans, and squash. Men cleared the fields that the women planted, cultivated, and harvested. Nearby, women gathered firewood, necessary for cooking and heating, and collected edible wild green plants, nuts, and fruits to supplement cultigens. When local sources of firewood were exhausted and fields drained of their fertility by repeated crops of maize, a new village would be established at some distance from the old settlement. Males were frequently away, hunting, trading, or waging war. Deer was the most important mammal that was hunted, both for its meat and its hide. Large quantities of fish were also harvested at semipermanent fishing stations. With the coming of Europeans, the harvesting of beaver pelts, to exchange for goods of European manufacture, became important. Wallace (1952) has contrasted the "village" and the "forest" in Iroquois life with the former being the women's domain while the latter was the sphere of male activities.

The dog was the only native domesticated animal, although captured bear cubs were raised in pens until of sufficient size to warrant slaughter for food. From their European neighbors the Iroquois obtained pigs that thrived in the temperate forest of North America and were found in large numbers in Seneca villages by the last quarter of the 17th century. Other European animal and plant domesticates were adopted, and through the 18th century the multifamily longhouse was used with lessening frequency, being replaced by single-family dwellings. As threats of outside invaders subsided, large villages fragmented into smaller hamlets that did not exhaust local resources.

Iroquois communities were divided into exogamous matriclans. The number varied from nation to nation, with the Mohawk and Oneida having only three clans each while the other nations had from eight to ten matriclans. A smaller clan might have just one lineage, but larger clans were divided into two or more lineages, each lineage headed by a senior woman or matron often referred to as a "clan mother." This woman had considerable responsibility in organizing the activities of her sisters,

#### **The Context of Health 745**

daughters, and nieces (sisters' daughters) in the lineage and in choosing from among her brothers, sons, and nephews (sisters' sons) in the lineage one qualified to hold a position as a political leader in the community (Fenton, 1978; Tooker, 1978b).

Marriage was monogamous. Men upon marriage left the home of their own clan and lineage to reside in houses belonging to their wives' lineage. As is often the case in matrilineal societies, divorce was relatively easy and common, with the children remaining in the home of their mother. Bonvillain (1980, pp. 52–53) notes the role of women in initiating pre-marital and extramarital sexual encounters which "occurred easily." She also notes that in the "ideal pattern" the lineage matron of an eligible male would arrange a marriage with the senior women of the lineage of a prospective bride. Extramarital affairs were among the behaviors condemned by the prophet Handsome Lake and he also condemned those who gossiped about such activities leading to the breakup of a marriage (Parker, 1913, pp. 32–33; Wallace, 1971, pp. 370–371). Fenton (1941b) reports infidelity of a husband as a common cause of female suicides.

Extensive documentation of Iroquois religious practices postdates both the revitalization of Iroquois religion by the prophet Handsome Lake, who experienced his first vision in 1799, and the conversion of substantial numbers of Iroquois to Christianity (Wallace, 1970). The yearly cycle of ceremonies was first outlined in Morgan's pioneering ethnography (Morgan, 1851). The major ceremonies, Midwinter and Green Corn, as well as many lesser ceremonies, relate to the agricultural year, but others such as the Strawberry ceremony and Maple ceremony celebrate the wild foods which had been important in the Iroquois diet (Fenton, 1936, 1941a). Another important aspect of religion among the Iroquois involved societies involved in the curing of illness.

# **THE CONTEXT OF HEALTH: ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL FACTORS**

Skeletal remains excavated from early historic (late 16th century) sites yield some clues about general health status in several Seneca villages (Wray, Sempowski, & Saunders, 1991; Wray, Sempowski, Saunders, & Cervone, 1987). Lacking information to be gained only from analyses of soft tissue or body fluids, the fragmentary nature of this record and possible collection bias dictates cautious interpretation. Given their close spatial and temporal proximity, variations among sites and even between cemeteries at a single site are puzzling. Pathologies at the Adams and Culbertson sites suggest many suffered from anemia or iron deficiencies (Wray et al., 1987, pp. 28–29, 188). Over half of the analyzable remains from Cemetery 2 at the Tram site exhibit pathologies, and the greater portion of these exhibit nutritional deficits or growth-disrupting illness (Wray et al., 1991, p. 390). The pathology rate at Cameron was low, but interment of immature individuals was very high, indicating contagious disease either of European origin or the result of poor sanitary conditions resulting from village size increases in the 16th century which could have promoted indigenous dysentery epidemics (Wray et al., 1991, p. 397).

Dobyns (1983, pp. 313–318) argued that European diseases introduced elsewhere in the Americas in the 16th century also swept through Iroquoia. A number of scholars (Henige, 1986; Snow & Lanphear, 1988, 1989) strongly reject that assertion, seeing no evidence of European disease epidemics among Iroquois people before 1634. Ramenofsky (1987), who concurs with Dobyns about the early impact of European disease on Native American populations, found insufficient archaeological evidence indicating that European diseases led to a 16th-century Iroquois population collapse.

None deny, however, the impact of European diseases such as smallpox, measles, and mumps on the Iroquois population during the 17th century. Snow (1994, p. 98) estimates half of the Mohawk population died over fewer than 100 days in 1634. Mortality from periodic epidemics of European diseases continued among Iroquois from that date until well into the 19th century. To maintain their population, the Iroquois adopted large numbers of refugee populations and war captives.

Estimates reporting the number of Iroquois fighting men from the latter half of the 17th century suggest 2,000 to 2,500 warriors (see Table 2), hence a total population of 10,000 to 12,500. A half-century of contact with European diseases had considerably reduced the population. Archaeological and ethnohistoric work with the Mohawk suggests a population in 1633, prior to epidemics of European diseases, of 8,000 to 10,000 for the Mohawk alone (Guldenzopf, 1984; Snow, 1992; Snow & Lanphear, 1988; Snow & Starna, 1989; Starna, 1980). Snow (1992, 1994, p. 100) notes the Mohawk population

had expanded greatly in the previous 50 years with an influx of refugees and/or war captives and speculates that the total Iroquois population was 22,000 in 1633, prior to the first epidemics of European diseases to strike Iroquoia.

Warfare was intensified in historic times (Abler, 1992), and skill in treating wounds was praised by a contemporary observer (Lafitau, 1974 –77 (2), pp. 204–206). Accidents were also a danger (traditional Iroquois still pray that dead tree limbs not fall on children playing underneath them) and fire was a constant hazard in villages composed of densely packed bark-covered dwellings.

Suicide has been a continuing pattern in Iroquois communities (Fenton, 1941b, 1986). Abuse or mistreatment can lead one to suicide. Both children abused by parents and middle-aged women abandoned by husbands are prominent among those who commit suicide. Also, a political leader who had lost the support of his followers might take his own life. A typical method for committing suicide was ingesting the root of the water-hemlock, *Cicuta maculata*.

# **MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS**

Recent ethnographic studies of conservative portions of Iroquois communities report that diagnosis of illness occurs separate from its treatment. There are a small number of clairvoyants or traditional diagnosticians who are regularly consulted about the cause of a patient's problem. These practitioners then direct patients to appropriate cures. Advice may be to consult a herbalist for treatment, to have a rite performed by one of the medicine societies, or to consult specialists in western medicine (Blau, 1969, p. 7; Shimony, 1994, pp. 270–274; Isaacs, 1973, p. 77).

Herbalists are specialists who have acquired from an earlier generation knowledge of local flora and the efficacy of their use (Herrick, 1995). Fenton (1940, p. 793) notes a herbalist of either sex may pass his or her knowledge on to either a son or daughter or even, skipping a generation, to a grandchild. The knowledge of herbalists is often extensive; Fenton reports that knowledgeable herbalists with whom he worked could identify from 200 to 300 species of plants, perhaps a third of the plants available locally (Fenton, 1942, p. 504; see also Isaacs, 1973, pp. 76–79). However, plants in the ethnopharmacopoeia have changed over time (Isaacs, 1976–77, pp. 272–281).

Religious practices and health practices overlap. Specific illnesses may require performance of specific rites by medicine societies with a restricted membership. Some of their rites occur in public ceremonies; others can be witnessed only by the patient and society members. Generally, having been cured by a specific medicine conferred membership, with its obligations, in the society. The nature of the illnesses treated by these societies and the sort of rites performed are briefly discussed below, although it should be recognized many participants are uneasy about public discussion of these matters. Here we summarize only material which has appeared in print.

Fenton reports a ritual pattern followed by the medicine societies in conducting their rites. Invitations are sent out by a headman. A thanksgiving and tobacco invocation begins the meeting. These are followed by the ritual with its cycle of songs. The participants are then thanked and appropriate food is provided for the participants (Fenton, 1979, p. 1607). Medicine societies are the means by which individual illness becomes a group concern because participation involves mutual aid, allays anxieties about health, and increases involvement in traditional Iroquois culture (Lex, 1977, p. 284).

Certainly the best documented among the medicine societies is the Society of Faces, often named the False Face Society. Participants wear wooden masks, usually painted either red or black, with perforated brass plates for eyes and hair made from tails of horses. They carried large rattles made of the shell of the snapping turtle, its long neck reinforced with splints to form the handle. The Society of Faces journeyed through the community in the spring and fall visiting houses to drive out disease (the Traveling Rite). Fenton (1941c, p. 425) described his encounter with the Faces on the Allegany Reservation in the 1930s: "The company afforded a wild spectacle as they sped up the valley road in open Fords with their hair whipping in the chill winds; they grated their rattles on the car body and uttered their terrifying cries whenever they swerved to pass a

#### **Classification of Illness, Theories of Illness, and Treatment of Illness 747**

stranger." They also perform publicly at the Midwinter ceremony. Individuals suffering from illnesses which the Faces have the power to cure can also have private rites performed for them in their homes and subsequently become members of the society (Fenton, 1987). Both private and public rites manipulate fire as a source of power for preventing or curing illness (Isaacs & Lex, 1980).

A second masked medicine society is the Husk Faces or Bushy Heads. They wear masks made of braided corn husks. They serve as heralds to announce the arrival of the Society of Faces during the Traveling Rite and at Midwinter. Among the ailments cured by Husk Faces is backache (Fenton, 1987, p. 400).

The third medicine society to use masks has been named by Parker (1913, pp. 122–123) the Society of Mystic Animals (it is also known as the Medicine Company or Shake the Pumpkin). The "blind masks" once used by this society, with which the wearer demonstrated his power to find objects even though the wooden mask had no eye holes, were out of use by 1900 (Fenton, 1987, p. 48). Pig masks carved of wood are also used by this society which performs its rituals in a darkened room, and Speck (1949, p. 104) reports the medicine used by this society to be "extraordinarily powerful."

The most powerful of the medicines is held by the Little Water Society. Strictly speaking members of this society did not cure, since all their rituals served to maintain the potency of the Little Water medicine. The rites are conducted in the dark, between 11:00 pm and dawn and both gourd rattles and a flute are used to accompany the cycle of songs. Visitors may listen in the next room but only the initiated should witness the renewal of the medicine (Parker, 1913, pp. 116–118). As the most potent of available medicines, the Little Water medicine is also the most dangerous, and one who has custody of such medicine must exhibit exemplary behavior (Shimony, 1994, p. 284).

Other important medicine societies include the Pygmy Society or Dark Dance, the Eagle Society, the Bear Society, the Otter Society, and the Buffalo Society. Speck (1949, pp. 59–60) describes several dissociative illnesses which one or another of these societies were able to cure, such as convulsions in an Oneida woman treated by the Buffalo Society and howling hysteria in a brother and sister treated by the Bear Society.

Not all illnesses require interventions by medicine societies. In some instances a cure necessitates performance of a particular rite or dance with general participation, for example the war dance. Outcomes of games, such as lacrosse or snow snake or the Bowl Game, could have curative as well as predictive effects (see Blau, 1969, p. 144; Speck, 1949, pp. 115–126).

# **CLASSIFICATION OF ILLNESS, THEORIES OF ILLNESS, AND TREATMENT OF ILLNESS**

Iroquois theory asserted that misfortune and ill health could be caused by several sources. These could be simply physical, as with injury or war wounds. Another source was witchcraft in which illness is caused by foreign objects that have been magically projected into one's body. A failure to perform obligatory rites or rituals was another. Spirits, including those of the dead, could attack. An additional and significant cause of illness was unfulfilled desires of the soul that were expressed among the Iroquois through dreams. In his evaluation of this last category, Wallace, a psychological anthropologist, considers the Iroquois dream theory as "basically psychoanalytic" and phrased "in language which might have been used by Freud himself." The Iroquois recognized that the mind possessed both conscious and unconscious desires and "were aware that the frustration of these desires could cause mental and physical ('psychosomatic') illness." They were also aware that the dreams often had latent content which required considerable interpretation to uncover their symbolism (Wallace, 1958). A frequent desire of the soul as expressed in dreams was for the performance of a particular ceremony by one of the medicine societies.

Shimony (1970) reports that witchcraft is universally attributed to "jealousy" but notes this is most often envy of unusual achievement on the part of the bewitched or a past grievance. She reports cases in which auto accidents and the death of a child were attributed to witchcraft. Witches can transform themselves into animals, but they are also sometimes seen at night as flying lights. Shimony points out that those who prove themselves able to cure illnesses caused by witchcraft sometimes come under suspicion of being witches themselves (on witchcraft, see also Herrick, 1995, pp. 37–38, 42–44).

Isaacs (1973, pp. 72–72a) notes external causes in addition to witchcraft which could cause physical distress. These include being attacked by a spirit of a dead individual or because one has offended an animal spirit. The former is often revealed by the fact that one dreams of the deceased. Affliction by an animal spirit could call for the performance of the rites of one of the medicine societies. Speck (1949, pp. 65–67) cites the case of a woman suffering from St Vitus's dance whose father had mistreated his catch while fishing. Her illness called for a performance of the rites of the Otter society.

Herrick (1995, p. 37) reports "offensive behaviorial acts or taboo violations" as a primary cause of disease and misfortune. This includes contact with a menstruating woman or even eating rich foods. Possession of powerful medicines and charms can pose a danger to one and one's family if one fails to treat and "feed" (e.g., perform rituals, burn tobacco) the medicine in the required manner (see Fenton, 1987, pp. 143–144; Shimony, 1970, pp. 250–254, 1994, p. 285). Also, witnessing rites of a medicine society by the uninitiated can lead to hysteria or other mental or physical harm. Initiation into the society is often the cure (Shimony, 1994, p. 282). Herrick (1995, pp. 50–63) presents a list of 287 conditions (with some repetition or overlapping testimony) of illnesses with their causes.

There are specific illnesses that demand the performance of a medicine society for their cure. Fenton (1987, p. 143) lists various symptoms of False Face sickness which can be cured by the Society of Faces. These center on the head, shoulders, and joints and include inflamation and swelling of face, nose bleeding, earache, toothache, other facial pain, and facial paralysis (see also Isaacs & Lex, 1980, p. 8).

# **SEXUALITY AND REPRODUCTION**

Women typically bore four or fewer children and spaced their children by 5- or 6-year intervals. There was a herbal remedy which was believed to induce abortions, but its use was forbidden in the teachings of the Seneca prophet, Handsome Lake (Parker, 1913, p. 30). Contraception was also forbidden by Handsome Lake, but it is reported that it is practiced by his contemporary followers, that boiled sassafras shoots is thought to be an abortifacient, and that they are also convinced that prolonged breast-feeding reduces fertility in women (Shimony, 1994, pp. 208–209). Shimony also observed a gender difference in average duration of breast-feeding, with two years usual for girls but a range of from one year to 1 year and 9 months for boys. Engelbrecht (1987) concludes from evidence from historic sources discussing the Iroquois and their neighbors and from archaeological sites that the average Iroquois family size was small. Those who have investigated Iroquois culture have ignored the issue of homosexuality. A recent study reports the belief that masturbation leads to insanity (Herrick, 1995, p. 70).

# **HEALTH THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE**

### **Pregnancy and Birth**

Conception is thought to take place during a new moon. Pregnant women are expected to refrain from certain activities, such as associating with men engaged in hunting or making medicines (Shimony, 1994, p. 207). Pregnant women had to bring their own cup to use when strawberries were distributed as part of the annual Strawberry Ceremony in June (Shimony, 1994, p. 159). Skinning mink was avoided since the odor was thought to cause abortions and certain behaviors (such as sitting in a doorway or sitting upon one's foot) are to be avoided as detrimental to the birth or the fetus. Contact with a menstruating woman would also cause abortion (Shimony, 1994, pp. 208, 217). While geophagy was known among the general population, it "is quite common among pregnant women" (Shimony, 1994, p. 208). Kneeling was the traditional position for delivery, a practice still "found occasionally" a half-century ago (Shimony, 1994, p. 207). Maidenhair fern was prescribed by midwives for labor pains and sassafras was brewed into a tonic for use by women after childbirth (Fenton, 1942, p. 517).

### **Infancy**

Public recognition of the place of an infant in a community came at the Midwinter Ceremony or the Green Corn Ceremony that followed its birth. Today the exact day on which the names are announced as one element within these lengthy ceremonies varies. A speaker announces the name of each new member of the community. Each infant receives a name held or owned by the matriclan into which she or he was born (Sturtevant, 1984). Only one living person bears a specific name, and infants thought destined to fulfill important ritual roles in adulthood are given names of deceased ritualists (Blau, 1969, p. 27).

Infants are reported to have been nursed for lengthy periods, 3 years being common with observations nearly

two centuries apart reporting cases of children over 5 years of age still nursing (Engelbrecht, 1987, p. 19). Children were weaned by painting the nipple black to frighten the child, placing a chicken feather on the breast, or coating the nipple with a noxious, non-toxic substance (Shimony, 1994, p. 209). A recent study among the Mohawks of Kahnawake, Quebec, reported that breast-feeding increased from 45% of infants in 1978 to 64% in 1986 (Macaulay, Hanusaik, & Beauvais, 1989).

Traditionally infants would be strapped to a cradle board, a plank approximately 0.5 m long and 0.25 m wide. At the bottom there was a foot-board and the head was protected by a hoop or bow. Morgan (1851, p. 390) reported "the patience and quiet of the Indian child in this close confinement are quite remarkable."

High infant mortality is indicated by the Iroquois proverb, "an infant's life is as the thinness of a maple leaf" (Fenton, 1978, p. 314). Engelbrecht (1987, pp. 21–22) argues that the fact that Handsome Lake found it necessary to preach against infanticide indicates its earlier practice. Scattered references found in the historic literature suggest that infants may have met death through conscious actions or neglect in cases in which their mother died or their mother was distraught because of the death of a husband or other social circumstances. Handsome Lake specifically stated that childless women should adopt infants born to their sisters (Parker, 1913, p. 35).

### **Childhood**

Restraint on the actions of children was limited. The prefered form of punishment for bad behavior was to splash the child with cold water. A thorough dousing or the threat of a dunking in a cold stream were used on children who do not reform. A red willow whip, to which tobacco had been burned, was used to strike particularly disobedient children. Traditional values disapproved slapping. Indeed, severely punishing children was thought to bring disease, hysteria, or the vomiting of worms upon the disciplinarian (Shimony, 1994, pp. 209–210). Parents also refrained from disciplining children lest they commit suicide by eating the poisonous root, *Cicuta*, or that they might mature to abuse their elderly parents (Fenton, 1941b, p. 125). Field workers have noted considerable respect for the rights of children to make their own decisions. Shimony (1994, p. 269) records the case of parents accepting the refusal of a 9-year-old to undergo a heart operation deemed necessary by the local hospital.

#### **Adolescence**

Oral traditions suggest that vision quests by males at puberty were once a significant element in Iroquois culture, but this does not appear to have been widely practiced in historic times. Similarly, oral tradition suggests the isolation of a girl for up to a year at the time of her first menses, but again this seems to have disappeared as a practice by the time observers were recording Iroquois culture and behavior. The girl did have to observe the prohibitions of behavior observed by any menstruating woman for the first three days of her period (Shimony, 1994, pp. 215–216).

As a mark of maturity, the "baby name" previously held was replaced, each person receiving an adult name from the roster of names of his or her matriclan. As was the case with the "baby name," these names were publicly announced at either the Green Corn Ceremony or the Midwinter Ceremony. One of the boys who had received a new name then led a Great Feather Dance as part of the worship (Fenton, 1963).

### **Adulthood**

Since the time of Morgan (1851, p. 83), clan exogamy has been recognized among the Iroquois. However, this rule has been frequently breached, even among conservative Iroquois. Lineage exogamy is more frequently observed. In addition to these matrilineal relatives, all persons related to one through either parent are forbidden as a spouse or sexual partner (see Shimony, 1994, pp. 30–32).

Adult males, particularly those with ritual obligations, undergo a regimen of purging for three days in the spring. In the past this included baths in a sweat lodge. Various herbal concoctions are used as emetics and laxatives to cleanse the body. An 18th-century observer noted the use for purging of "very strong medicines which clear them out to excess and might well kill a horse" (Lafitau, 1974–77 (2), p. 206). One fasts during the purge but then takes tonics to regain one's strength. Sassafras is thought to restore the blood following the period of the purge. In addition to this period of "spring cleaning," men may also purge themselves in preparation for an important ritual (Parker, 1913, p. 77; Shimony, 1994, pp. 265–266). A phobia apparently rare or absent among Iroquois males is fear of heights (Wallace, 1951, p. 64).

Onset of menses was believed to occur at the new moon. Shimony (1994, pp. 216–218) reports that women were considered "poisonous" or "dangerous" during the first 3 days. They should not attend curing rituals or be in the presence of medicines, nor should they come into close contact with males. They even constitute a danger to themselves, since if they comb their hair it might fall out. They may attend longhouse events, but should drink from their own cup rather than the common dipper. These restrictions are no longer followed, and the timing of the Midwinter Ceremony no longer allows 5 days for completion of mestruation (Blau, 1969, pp. 59–60; Shimony, 1994, p. 174). Contact with a menstruating woman causes bloody diarrhea and bleeding piles. Menstrual blood is also an ingredient in love medicines that can lead to bad luck or even insanity.

### **The Aged**

Morgan (1851, p. 171) recorded the teaching of the Longhouse religion speaker from Tonawanda, Jimmy Johnson: "It is the will of the Great Spirit that you reverence the aged, even though they be as helpless as infants." The prophet Handsome Lake preached that it was "ordained that people should live to an old age" and that "an old woman should be as a child again and when she becomes so the Creator wishes the grandchildren to help her" (Parker, 1913, p. 35). Despite this, Fenton (1941b, p. 125) feels "that the number of cases where Iroquois adults have maltreated their aged parents is great enough to warrant investigation" and notes that two abused elderly Onondaga males committed suicide. In one of these cases there were factors involved other than simply abuse by adult children.

Randle (1951, p. 171) presents an idyllic view of the role of the aged woman: "Honored as heads of clans and household, the old age of women could be rewarding, surrounded by her offspring." Although unmarked by a rite of passage, after menopause women can partake in activities involving curing and medicines that previously had been barred to them (Shimony, 1994, p. 218). Wallace (1951, p. 64) notes that the absence of fear of heights continues into old age—"even old men of 60 and 70 will take, and efficiently perform, such jobs as pruning high trees, painting the roofs of buildings, and carpentry work on scaffolds."

### **Dying and Death**

Several authors have commented upon the excessive grief and intensity of mourning found among the Iroquois. Wallace (1970, p. 77) noted: "Descriptions of Seneca mourning behavior read like psychoanalytic essays on the dynamics of depressive states, and the paranoia of bereavement, which generated blood feud and fear of witchcraft, was regarded by the Iroquois themselves as a continuing threat to the solidarity of the community."

Unusual behaviors of birds often foretold deaths (Shimony, 1994, p. 234). People prefered to die at home, and those believed terminally ill had the clothes in which they will be dressed in their coffin placed within their view. Although an innovation of the modern New York Onondaga involved a ritual of lying in state in their Longhouse to show respect for a Confederacy chief (Blau, 1969, p. ix), traditionally the corpse was on view in a coffin in the home. This was a time of much unease, since the dead attract other dead who may take offence at some action among the living especially inattention to ritual details—and cause illness or bad luck. Children under the age of five were considered particularly vulnerable, and typically a deerskin thong tied around the wrist was used to protect them from the spirit of the dead. Shimony reports that a wake involving special songs and a wake game was conducted on the Six Nations reserve, but this was not practiced by the conservative element in other Iroquois communities. The grave was dug by a member of the moiety opposite to that of the deceased.

The whole community mourned for 10 days, culminating in a tenth-day feast organized by matrilineal kin of the deceased and marked by distribution of his or her property. The spirit of the dead then may depart the community, but would be addressed again during a feast on the first anniversary of death. It is believed that Handsome Lake forbade mourning for an entire year, considering that practice too disruptive to daily life (Shimony, 1994, pp. 228–250). An all-night Feast of the Dead (*Ohgiwe*) is held at least once annually to honor and propitiate potentially restive spirits (Blau, 1969, pp. 245–252; Fenton & Kurath, 1951, pp. 139–166; Lex, 1977, p. 294; Shimony, 1994, pp. 229–233). Certain songs are sung falsetto, and dancers move clockwise as does distribution of special feast foods. At dawn a procession of the living was intermingled with spirits of the dead.

# **CHANGING HEALTH PATTERNS**

In the mid-20th century no strict dichotomy of beliefs and behaviors associated with health and illness distinguished Longhouse adherents from those who eschew traditional

#### **Changing Health Patterns 751**

beliefs (Weaver, 1972, p. 33), and acceptance of Western medical services by some Six Nations reserve inhabitants is documented before 1850 (Weaver, 1972, p. 39). Contagious diseases such as smallpox (Weaver, 1971, pp. 361–378) diminished as preventive measures such as vaccination and sanitation improvements became available on reservations and reserves; most prevalent currently are chronic diseases stemming from behavioral risk factors (Lex & Norris, 1994, pp. 193–196).

Among Iroquois in both the United States and Canada, alienation of land, breach of treaty rights, and monetary exploitation—as well as discriminatory attitudes and actions of the dominant societies—have promoted resentment and distrust of governmental authority, and concomitantly reinforced desire to be treated as sovereign nations (Abler, 1997, pp. 27–28; Weaver, 1971, pp. 361–378; Weaver, 1972, pp. 32–37). Prevention and treatment in Canada are provided by Health Canada, and in New York by the American Indian Health Program of the state Department of Health (not the Federal Indian Health Service). Governing bodies on each reserve or reservation would need to grant permission for health-related surveys (Lex & Norris, 1994, p. 195), and some reject enumeration (Department of Health, 1999, p. 32). Given intragroup factionalism, participation could be neither required nor guaranteed despite needs for knowledge to plan appropriate programs.

Some chronic disease data are available from selected samples. Indian populations have high rates of Diabetes mellitus (Type 2 diabetes) linked with obesity, hypertension, anemia, and nutrient deficiencies, as well as complications of pregnancy (Lex & Norris, 1994, pp. 198–199). For 1980 to 1986 in upstate New York, birth certificate data were compared for Indian (predominantly Iroquois), white, black, and other race infants (Buck et al., 1992, pp. 569–575). Mothers of Indian infants not only were younger, had less education, had more children, and took longer to obtain prenatal care than mothers of white infants, but also had more post-term births and excessivesized (4,000 g) babies—factors associated with gestational diabetes or diabetes mellitus. Death certificate data for the same interval (Mahoney, Ellrott, & Michalek, 1989, pp. 403–412) showed that Indians died at an average age 9 years younger than others (women 65 versus 74 years; men 58 versus 67 years), with ages 50 to 59 years and 20 to 29 years showing higher rates for females and males, respectively. Diabetes mellitus was the leading cause of death for women, followed by liver cirrhosis,

nephritis, and homicide, and for men major causes were tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, and pneumonia.

A tribal survey of the Seneca Nation of Indians during the mid-1970s reported 26% had diabetes mellitus. Epidemiologists assessed mortality causes by analyzing death certificate data for 914 deaths among 3,262 Seneca (391 of 1,690 females and 523 of 1,572 males) listed on the tribal roll January 1, 1955, resident in New York State, and followed until December 31, 1984, in comparison with deaths of other upstate New York inhabitants during that interval (Mahoney, Michalek, Cummings, Nasca, & Emrich, 1989, pp. 816–826). Tuberculosis was the leading cause for Seneca women, followed by diabetes mellitus, pneumonia, liver cirrhosis, nephritis, accidents, and homicide; for Seneca men ranked causes were tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, hernia/intestinal obstruction, cirrhosis, and accidents. Median age at death increased from 55.9 years during the first decade studied to 64.6 years during the last. A similar study analyzed 74 deaths among 3,033 Seneca children (47 of 1,483 females and 27 of 1,550 males) ages 0 to 24 years born between January 1, 1955, and December 31, 1989 (Michalek, Mahoney, Buck, & Snyder, 1993, pp. 403–407). Most deaths before age 5 were from infectious diseases. Between ages 15 and 24 years, accidents, particularly motor vehicle accidents, were predominant causes for both males and females, with males also exhibiting elevated suicide rates.

In a 1985 study, Kahnawake Mohawk adults with and without diabetes mellitus were chosen randomly and matched for age and sex. Data from clinical records, interviews, and body measurements showed male and female diabetics to have 5.51 times more peripheral vascular disease, with ratios of 4.57 for cerebrovascular disease and 3.56 for ischemic heart disease. Among diabetics, 48% had ischemic heart disease (versus 22% of non-diabetics), the highest known rates for North American Indians. Moreover, 86% and 74%, respectively, were obese. Persons with diabetes also had high rates of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetic complications. These factors in combination indicated need for community-wide interventions (Macaulay, Montour, & Adelson, 1988, pp. 221–224; Montour, Macaulay, & Adelson, 1989, pp. 549–552).

Children between ages 9 and 10 years exhibited increased weight, height, body mass index, and subscapular skinfold thickness (SSF) associated with increased television viewing and decreased physical fitness. Findings led to a pioneering community-based primary prevention program, the Kahnawake Schools Diabetes Prevention Project, to change diets and promote physical activity (Macaulay, et al., 1997, pp. 779–790). In 1994, 103 girls and 95 boys attending elementary schools in two Mohawk communities were surveyed for demographic and lifestyle variables, height, weight, and SSF were measured, and children performed a run/walk fitness test, with a follow-up assessment of SSF in 1996.

Despite improvements for some children, risk factors, especially television viewing, were confirmed for Kahnawake girls (Horn, Paradis, Potvin, Macaulay, & Desrosiers, 2001, pp. 274–281). Also, among asthmatics ages 4 through 12 years, Seneca girls were over-represented when compared with pupils from other ethnic groups; their "triggers" were associated with adverse housing conditions (Lwebuga-Mukasa & Dunn-Georgiou, 2000, pp. 745–761). Accordingly, lifestyle factors associated with risk for development of chronic diseases and associated complications need to be discerned and addressed on reserves and reservations, with special emphasis on understanding gender differences
