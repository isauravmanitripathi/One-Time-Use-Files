GRINDING POVERTY & TERRIBLE LIVING CONDITIONS

### Statistics below are till the Nehru Dynasty times of up to UPA-I&II. Things began to improve since 2014, albeit gradually.

Thanks to the Nehruvian economic policies, millions of Indians were condemned to grinding poverty.

We have the largest number of poor—a third of the world's poor! As per the World Bank's estimate, while 69% Indians live on less than US\$2 per day, 33% fall below the international poverty line of US\$1.25 per day. In terms of GDP per capita, India stands at 129 among 183 countries as per IMF tabulation for 2011. Per capita income in India is little more than half that of Sri Lanka, about a sixth that of Malaysia, and a third that of Jamaica. Things have been improving, but precious decades were lost in povertyperpetuating Nehruvian economic policies.

Says Darryl D'Monte in an article, 'Living off the land', that appeared in the Hindustan Times: "…Oxford University and the UN Development Programme brought out a 'Multidimensional Poverty Index' or MPI which replaced the Human Poverty Index. The researchers analysed data from 104 countries with a combined population of 5.2 billion, constituting 78% of the world's total. It found that about 1.7 billion people in these countries live in multidimensional poverty. If income alone is taken into account, at less than \$1.25 a day, a standard measure throughout the world, this amounts to 1.3 billion. The startling fact that emerges from this analysis, which made headlines throughout the world, is that using the MPI, just eight Indian states have more poor people than the 26 poorest African countries combined. These sub-Saharan countries—like Ethiopia—are considered the worst-off in the world, with pictures of starving children there becoming symptomatic of a deep malaise."

Worldwide rankings for 2012 by the Mercer Quality of Living Survey lists 49 cities. No Indian city makes the grade. Mercer City Infrastructure Ranking, 2012 lists 50 cities. No Indian city appears in the list. Among the

prominent cities in the world, the 25 dirtiest include New Delhi and Mumbai having mostly the African cities for company.

Two cities in India, Sukinda and Vapi, rank 3 rd and 4th in the world as the most polluted cities! Even our water bodies and rivers, including the most sacred ones, get dirtier by the year. The sacred rivers have been reduced to sewers. The waters of the Ganga are pure and sparkling when it starts from Gangotri, with a BOD, that is, Biochemical Oxygen Demand, of zero, and a DO, Dissolved Oxygen, of over 10. Water with BOD level of less than 2mg per litre can be consumed without treatment; that with BOD level between 2 and 3 mg per litre can be consumed, but only after treatment; and that with BOD level above 3 mg per litre is unfit even for bathing. Ganga-Yamuna water at Sangam in Allahabad has a BOD level of 7.3 mg per litre! It is totally unfit even for bathing!!

To summarise a ToI report, "A pitcherful of poison: India's water woes set to get worse", India ranks third-lowest, a lowly 120, in a list of 122 countries rated on quality of potable water. By 2020, India is likely to become a water-stressed nation. Nearly 50% of Indian villages still do not have any source of protected drinking water. Of the 1.42 million villages in India, 1.95 lacs are affected by chemical contamination of water. 37.7 million are afflicted by waterborne diseases every year. Nearly 66 million people in 20 Indian states are at risk because of excessive fluoride in their water. Nearly 6 million children below 14 suffer from dental, skeletal and non-skeletal fluorosis. In Jhabua district, bone deformities are common among children. Arsenic is the other big killer lurking in ground water, putting at risk nearly 10 million people. The problem is acute in several districts of West Bengal. The deeper aquifers in the entire Gangetic plains contain arsenic. In UP's Ballia district, the problem is so acute that almost every family has been affected—most people are suffering from skin rashes, some have lost their limbs; many are dying a slow death due to arsenic-induced cancer. Bacteriological contamination, which leads to diarrhoea, cholera and hepatitis, is most widespread in India.

The HDI, Human Development Index, is a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and income indices and was published by the UNDP, United Nations Development Programme. In 2016, India ranked 130 on HDI among 187 countries, below even Iraq and Egypt!

The Hunger and Malnutrition (HUNGaMA) report by the Naandi Foundation points out that 42 per cent of under-fives Indian children are severely or moderately underweight and that 59 per cent of them suffer from moderate to severe stunting.

As per another study released on Mother's Day, India ranks 76th among 80 "less developed countries" in the world on Mother-care Index, that is 5 th worst.

Health-care system—we beat even the poorest countries in Africa in infant mortality rates! The rate is a measure of number of deaths of infants under one year old in a given year per 1,000 live births. Among 221 countries, India ranks 50—rank 1 being the worst—with an infant mortality rate of 46. That is, among 221 countries, 171 countries are better off than India. China's infant mortality rate is 15.62, Singapore's 2.65, while India's is 46.07. Over 400,000 newborns die within the first 24 hours of their birth every year in India, the highest anywhere in the world, a study by an international non-government organisation, "Save the Children", has declared.

Take MMR, the Maternal Mortality Rate, which is the annual number of female deaths per 100,000 live births from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management. The MMR includes deaths during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy. India ranks 52—rank 1 being the worst—among 183 countries, with an MMR of 200 deaths per 100,000 live births. MMR is 37 for China and just 3 for Singapore.

Take housing. Government's recent housing survey reveals that 53% of Indian homes are without toilets, 68% are without access to clean tap water, 39% do not have indoor kitchens, and 70% make do with one or two room homes. Figures don't reveal the real horror. Of course, all—men, women and children—suffer; but, the main sufferers are women: having to defecate in the open in the absence of toilets, having to fetch water in the absence of tap-water at home, having to cook without a kitchen!

There are nearly 97 million urban poor living in 50,000 slums in India, 24% of which are located along nallahs and drains and 12% along railway lines. And, thanks to our lack of planning and neglect, the number of slums and the slum population is on the rise. The worst affected are the children our future—in these slums.

Singapore and Finland recruit teachers in schools from among the brightest 10% of graduates and offer them salaries on par with engineers. And, in India? Quality of graduates from engineering and management colleges is so poor many remain unemployable. Our education system—it is a mess.

In literacy, India is 183 among 214 countries—below many African countries. Reports 'The Economic Times' of 18 January 2013: "The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER 2012) by NGO Pratham shows that the number of Class V students who could not read a Class II level text or solve a simple arithmetic problem has increased. In 2010, 46.3% of kids in this category failed to make the cut and this shot up to 51.8% in 2011 and 53.2% in 2012...In 2010, 29.1% children in Class V could not solve a twodigit subtraction problem without seeking help. This proportion increased to 39% in 2011 and 46.5% in 2012."

The hitherto Dynasty-driven Nehruvian-socialistic-populist-babudomdominated dynacratic India rarely disappoints in scoring the top grade when it comes to the negatives. With the exit of the Nehru-Gandhi Dynasty since 2014 the things have been thankfully improving.

#### THROTTLED INDUSTRIALISATION

Nehru, through his anti-private-sector policies, throttled industrialisation, and consequently employment generation. Although, in comparison with the deliberate neglect in the British period, the progress in industrialisation during the Nehru period was much better owing to significant public sector investments. It was also helped by the very significant second world war sterling debt repayments by the UK, and aid by other countries like the US, the USSR and Germany. However, when the repayment of the sterling debt by the UK tapered off, and not much further foreign aid was forthcoming, and the public sector into which Nehru had sunk the investment was either in loss or not able to generate adequate surplus, the industrialisation momentum began to taper off, as there were no funds; and given Nehru's socialistic approach, the private sector was anyway shackled!

Further, not learning anything from Japan and others, who had dramatically prospered with their outward-looking, export-led growth, India

under Nehru went in for inward-looking, import-substitution model, denying itself a world-class, competitive culture, incentive for production of quality products, share in the world-trade, and the consequent prosperity. Instead, India invested heavily in the inefficient public sector, overregulated and strangulated private enterprise, shunned foreign capital, and ignored better technology.

Despite Sardar Patel's objections, Nehru pushed through the Industrial Policy Resolution in April 1948 that reserved many areas under the state sector: railways, defence manufacturing, atomic energy, and so on. Further, new enterprises in steel, coal, ship-building, communications, and many others could only be under the state sector. By 1954, Nehru made Parliament accept as the aim of economic development the "socialist pattern of society". Socialism was enshrined in 1955 as the official policy of the Congress at its Avadi session. The 1956 version of the Industrial Policy Resolution made the state even more dominant—it allowed new ventures in textiles, automobiles and defence only to the state, and vested exclusive controls to it over many other sectors. Wrote MKK Nair:

"As a Socialistic pattern of economy had been adopted by the Parliament in December 1954, the new industrial policy embraced the same objective… An important aspect of socialism was establishing Government control over sectors that brought financial wellbeing. With that in view, the importance of public sector was enhanced and industries that would be brought into it were listed. They included explosives, arms, defence equipment, atomic energy, iron & steel, heavy metallic castings, mining machinery, heavy electrical equipment, coal & lignite, petroleum, mining for Iron, Manganese, diamond & minerals for atomic energy, aircraft manufacture, air transportation, railways, ship building, telephone and electricity generation."{MKN}

A series of Five-Year Plans started from 1952 that sank precious investment in the inefficient public sector, and rather than enhancing the growth rate, made it crawl at 3%. Much needed foreign-investment was shunned, thanks to simpleton economic understanding, ignorance on "what makes a country prosper", and faulty application of the anti-colonial mindset. Many industries were barred for the private sector. When entrepreneurs in the countries in Southeast Asia, like South Korea, were being encouraged to expand and set up industries and their government was offering them cheap credit, here in India we were doing the opposite: GD

Birla was refused a license for setting up a steel plant; scores of business proposals of Tatas were rejected; Aditya Birla, looking to the hostile business environment in India, chose to set up industries outside India; ...the list is endless.

Krishna Menon [the right-hand man of Nehru] had reportedly snubbed offers of the Japanese corporate representatives for collaboration saying it was out of question on account of the vast differences in the policies of the two countries!{DD/346}

Given license-permit-quota-raj, reluctance to give licenses to the socalled "monopolies", anti-business policies and extortionist taxes maximum slab rate being over 80%—industrialisation had to suffer. Industrialisation and industries were sought to be controlled and managed by Nehru's IAS babus who knew next to nothing on how to run an industry. Nehru and the socialists had very simplistic notions on wealth creation: Nehru thought that all it took to have economic prosperity was to invest in industrialisation, especially in heavy industries, and to put babus in charge. Wrote a bureaucrat of those times MKK Nair:

"When factories in other areas began to be set up, experienced managers were not available and ICS officers were appointed to head public sector industries. But their training and experience were not suitable for industrial management. Many of them were too old to grasp the new culture of management. Thus, public sector companies began to be operated like Government departments…

"Both SN Mazumdar, General Manager of Rourkela [Steel Plant] and SN Mehta, General Manager of Bhilai [Steel Plant] were highest level ICS officers. They could work efficiently as Commissioners, Board Members or Chief Secretaries and discharge their duties with great aplomb. But they were frightened to spend two hundred crore Rupees in three years to build a million tonne steel plant. They were past the age to learn new ways of work. What happened in Rourkela and Bhilai got repeated elsewhere too when new public sector projects began to take shape… Industrial management is best left to those who are qualified to do it. If IAS or IPS officers who are neither familiar with nor trained for it are selected for it, it is a sin perpetrated on the public sector…"{MKN}

With the IAS babus in-charge, the expected results followed: Public sector companies began to be run like government departments—lethargic,

over-staffed, and corrupt—with no understanding of process or products. Investment in the public sector leviathan was a huge two-thirds of the country's investable funds, but to little avail—the public sector churned out shoddy goods and remained in loss. Of the entire paid-up capital in India, the share of the public sector rose to a massive 70% by 1978, with little benefits accruing to the nation. Our extremely scarce resources were squandered and precious public money was literally burnt by the Nehru and his dynasty in trying to do business.

Gurcharan Das mentions in 'India Unbound'{GD} of Kasturbhai Lalbhai establishing Atul chemical plant in collaboration with American Cyanamid in the wilds of Gujarat, building a whole township, and provided jobs to many tribals. When invited to inaugurate it in 1952, Nehru agreed after considerable reluctance. Why? Because, it was in the private sector!{GD/53-54}

#### NEGLECT OF AGRICULTURE

Nehru and his team were seemingly innocent of the basics of economics that without a prosperous agriculture, you can't have agricultural surplus, and without that, you can't feed the growing urban population and sustain industrialisation. Yet, they neglected agriculture. Agriculture was so neglected that by 1957 India's agricultural output fell below that of 1953!

Most countries like Japan and others who rapidly progressed and joined the first-world, first concentrated on agriculture and universal education. Nehru neglected both. Nehru copied the Soviets, without realising that all communist countries faced famines thanks to their stress on heavy industries at the expense of agriculture.

Nehru went socialistic where he should not have—in industrialisation; and did not go socialistic where he should have—in agriculture and land reforms. The renowned economist Jagdish Bhagwati had suggested that probably Indian needed capitalism in industry and socialism in land. But, Nehru did the reverse—besides wrong notions, the main factor was votes: Why annoy the powerful landlords and landed class? Wrote Kuldip Nayar in 'Beyond the Lines'{KN} : "...I got hold of the report (on land reforms) by Wolf Ladejinsky… His report vehemently criticized the government for having reforms on paper but doing very little on the ground… Surprisingly,

it was Nehru who had stopped the report from being made public... Nehru abandoned the proposal to initiate drastic land reforms when he found that the states were opposed to the measure. This sent a wrong message to the country and proved yet again that he hated to join issue when vested interests were involved."{KN}

I had quarrelled with him [Nehru] regarding his neglect of the village economy, especially agriculture, and protested to him about his almost total neglect of irrigation which was the key to Indian agriculture... Nehru told me disparagingly, 'You are a villager, you know nothing.' I retorted, 'If you had one-tenth of my regard for the village, the Indian economy would have been different.'...I am not sure if he had any convictions, except for aping the Russian model.

—*S. Nijalingappa, 'My Life and Politics: An Autobiography'* {Nij}

India faced severe shortages in food-items, became dependent on the US PL-480 food-aid, and became an international beggar.

## BUILDER OF 'MODERN' INDIA

Admirers claim Nehru was the builder of modern India. Is one referring to "modern" India with broken-down, side-lane-like highways, run-down Fiats and Ambassadors, meagre second world-war armaments to take care of its security, perennial food shortages, famines, millions in grinding poverty, both hands holding begging bowls? He did set up a string of research labs, but they did little, and became money sinks. Pathetic communication networks and transport severely affected economic growth, fight against poverty, mobility and national integration.

Many countries, including those in Southeast Asia, which were much behind India at the time India got independence, marched far ahead of India. When you look at their airports, their roads, their metros, their citybuses, their well laid-out cities, their infra-structure, their cleanliness, their everything, you wonder why you had remained (till the Nehruvian and the Nehru-Dynasty times [things have begun to change with Modi]) a country of crumbling roads, overcrowded locals, overhanging scary ugly mess of mesh of electrical, TV and internet cables blotting the skyline and brutally assaulting even the "chalta hai" sense of terribly intolerable tolerance of the

"have given up" generations; a country of absent pavements or encroached pavements or pavements that stink from the use they are not meant for, and where mercifully for the walkers this is not so, they are but patches of broken down pavers, punctuated by uncovered, or partially covered, or precariously or deceptively covered man-holes, awaiting their catch; a nation of stinking slums and impoverished villages, open drains and sewers, rotting garbage, squalor and stink all around, children and men defecating by the road-side—all testimony to criminal absence of the very basics of being modern and civilised...

Most of the Indian towns, cities and metros are dirty, foul smelling and hideous. They look like a defacement of spaces and a blot on the landscape. Cities in the West, Southeast Asia, China and elsewhere get better, cleaner, smarter and spiffier year after year, while ours get worse, more congested, more polluted, more difficult to live in and more squalid.

How's it that we got so left behind? What is it that we did, or did not do, after independence, that everything is so abysmal and pathetic? And all this unmitigated misery despite the overwhelming advantage of India as a nation with first-rate people, plentiful natural resources, grand civilisational heritage, rich culture and languages, unmatched ethical and spiritual traditions, and, above all, relatively better position in all fields infrastructure, trained manpower, bureaucracy, army—at the time of independence compared to all other nations who have since overtaken us. Why did we fail to leverage such rich assets of a gifted country? Well, all thanks to Nehruvian policies. Nehruvianism is responsible for keeping India forever a developing, third-world country.

## *Blunder–68 :*

#### PATHETIC INDIA VS. OTHER COUNTRIES

India, which was far better placed with respect to many countries in Southeast Asia when Nehru took over the charge of India, was left far, far behind all of them by the end of the Nehru's tenure. Nehru miserably failed to do justice to India's potential.

Let's take a concrete comparative example. After its separation from Malaysia in 1965, Singapore was left as an independent country that was not only poor and backward, and with meagre defensive capabilities, it had

NO natural resources—not even water! It had to import water from Malaysia. Lee Kuan Yew, often referred to by his initials as LKY, who became its Prime Minister, lead it through its traumatic separation. Thanks to his enlightened grasp on "what makes a nation strong and prosperous", sound and far-sighted diplomacy and foreign policy, innovative ideas, wise strategy and unmatched competence in governance, he lifted Singapore from a poor, backward, "Third World" nation in 1965 to a "First World" Asian Tiger by 1980—in mere 15 years!

In comparison, what did India achieve during the 17 years of Nehru rule? India had tremendous natural and water resources and the significant colonial legacy of defence, military, trained bureaucracy, industries and infrastructure, particularly railways. However, at the end of Nehru's 17-year rule India remained a poor, third-world country of starving millions begging the world for food and aid.

LKY managed to convert barren Singapore, with no water resources, into a clean, beautiful, green, garden nation. And, what has India done after independence? Converted India into a gigantic garbage bin!

Japan, which had almost the same GDP as India in the early 1950s, grew so fast that by 1980, India's GDP was a mere 17% of Japan's. Japan grew at massive 18% annually during the 15-year period starting 1965 and took its GDP from 91 billion dollars to a mammoth 1.1 trillion dollars by 1980.

Park Chung-Hee of South Korea took his poor, pathetic country amongst the world's poorest (poorer than India at the time of India's independence)—and placed it on an automatic path to the first-world status: today it is a rich, gleaming, confident country that would leave many advanced first-world western countries behind. South Korea's per capita income is currently 1400% that of India, although at the time of our Independence it was on par!

That Japan achieved what it did, and so also South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, was because their leaders refused to follow the politically convenient and self-serving populist socialistic path to nowhere; and didn't think aping the Soviets was a panacea. Thanks to the wisdom that dawned upon China, it junked its socialistic past, tremendously improved its governance, and is now a super power both economically and militarily.

### NEHRUVIAN (AND NOT 'HINDU') RATE OF GROWTH

India's poverty is self-inflicted, thanks to the self-destructive policies followed, even though prescriptions for prosperity were available off-theshelf for many years, and there were any number of real, practical examples to go by. Had Nehru's government focused on its primary responsibilities and desisted getting into business, had it allowed the freedom to public to do business, had it followed free-market economy, India would have shot into double-digit growth rate in the 1950s itself—such were its advantages over other countries—and would long since have been a part of the developed first world, rather than still being a poor, pathetic, struggling, limping, third-world country.

While the developing countries of SE-Asia, which had been far behind India in 1947, raced ahead at 9–12% growth rate or more and became highly prosperous, with infra-structure rivalling western countries, India plodded along at what was derisively referred to as the *Hindu rate of growth* of just 3%, and became a basket-case, begging aid and food from all. However, the term "Hindu rate of growth" is highly inappropriate and unfair, besides being derogatory. Let us examine why?

*One: The "Nehruvian rate of growth"* . The low rate of growth was thanks to Nehru-Indira-Rajiv's policies. If rather than the "Hindu rate of growth" it was called the "Nehruvian rate of growth" or "Nehruvian socialistic rate of growth" or "NIDP [Nehru-Indira-Dynasty policies] rate of growth", one would have no quarrel.

*Two: The "Colonial rate of growth"* . The rate of growth during the preindependence period, the colonial period, was even less! In fact, it had even turned negative during several long periods!! Why was the rate of growth then not called the "Colonial rate of growth" or the "Christian rate of growth" in a pejorative sense? As per the Cambridge University historian Angus Maddison, "India's share of the world income fell from 22.6% in 1700, comparable to Europe's share of 23.3%, to a low of 3.8% in 1952."

Hindu-India had been highly prosperous in the past, thanks to its *massive* "Hindu rate of growth", which is why first the Muslim hordes from the northwest of India, and then the Western countries invaded it. Until the rise of the West, India was possibly the richest country in the world, which is

why it presented an irresistible target for the ravaging Muslim hordes, and then the West. Why then was the term "Hindu rate of growth" not used in an adulatory sense?

*Three: How do you explain the recent growth rate of over 9%?* The same India, after only part junking of the Nehru-Indira-Rajiv socialistic policies, reached a growth rate of over 9%! Junk more of the Nehru-Indira socialistic policies, and the growth rate will rise to double-digits.

*Four: Absurdity of religious-cultural connotation* . Many Islamic countries prior to the world demand and discovery of oil were very poor. Was their growth rate called the "Islamic rate of growth"? The growth rate during the dark ages of Europe was static or negative, when during the same period India was immensely rich and progressive. Was it ever called the "Christian rate of growth"? Sri Lanka and Myanmar have had long periods of no growth or measly growth. Were they castigated for being under the spell of the "Buddhist rate of growth"? China's growth rate after going communist and till the end of the Mao-period was pathetic. Was it termed the "Atheistic or Communist rate of growth"? Why associate "Hindu" with a rate of economic growth unless there is an ulterior motive of deliberately showing Hinduism in bad light? Of course, many use the term unfeelingly, without being conscious of its implications.

*Five: Nehru vs. Hinduism* . Nehru was an agnostic, and was more English than Indian, more western than eastern, more "something else" than a Hindu, and therefore it is grossly inappropriate to name a rate of growth, which was thanks to him and his dynasty, as "Hindu".

*Six: Why not "Secular" rate of growth?* Nehru, Nehru-dynasty and company have raved ad nauseum on "secularism", without ensuring it in practice. Why not credit the growth rate thanks to them as the "Secular rate of growth"?

*Seven: Socialism vs. Hinduism* . Hindu-India has had long tradition of free international trade and commerce, and of liberal religious and world view. Such an ethos can never accept the Big Brother denouement or the run-up to it. There is an age old Indian proverb: *Raja Vyapari taya Praja Bhikhari* . That is, people become beggars when government enters into business. A belief in self-reliance and an overweening socialistic state on the part of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi actually did India in, rather than something that had anything to do with Hinduism.

*Eight: Socialism vs. Mahatma Gandhi and Others* . Mahatma Gandhi was no socialist. Nor were the other stalwarts like Sardar Patel, Rajaji and Rajendra Prasad. All the four—Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, Rajaji and Rajendra Prasad—quite unlike Nehru, could be considered as also representing the Hindu ethos, and perhaps precisely for that reason they were against socialistic claptrap of Nehru.

*Nine: A camouflage* . In any case, using "Hindu" as in "Hindu rate of growth" in a pejorative sense is not only insulting, it camouflages the real reasons—Nehruvian policies.

But, the question arises as to why did the term "Hindu rate of growth" gain currency? Well, here are the reasons.

*One: Raj Krishna* . The term was reportedly coined by the economist Raj Krishna to draw attention to the embarrassing rate of growth during the Nehru-Indira period. India being predominantly populated by the Hindus, he called it the "Hindu rate of growth". But, of course, he didn't mean it to be insulting to Hinduism.

*Two: Blame Hinduism rather than Socialism* . Indian politicians and bureaucrats never wanted to admit that the fault lay with the socialistic apparatus. Why blame self? Especially, why blame something on which you have fattened yourselves? The leftists, socialists and communists got prized slots in the government or government-aided organisations, societies and universities, and dominated the intellectual discourse in India. The whole band didn't mind the blame shifting to the religious-cultural heritage.

*Three: The Secularists* . For certain class of intellectuals the touchstone of secularism is whether you can be abusive to Hinduism. The term "Hindu" in "Hindu rate of growth" serves that purpose. It serves for them the double purpose: camouflage the ills resulting from socialism, and be also hailed "secular" the cheap way—by casting a slur on Hinduism.

*Four: The Colonialists and the India-baiters* . Other groups, which received the term with glee, lapped it up, and enthusiastically promoted it to disparage India, were the colonialists or those with the colonial mind-set or the brown sahibs, or the India-baiters. Give power to the Hindus, and what you will get is the "Hindu rate of growth"! Had the Raj continued, things would have been better!!

#### NEHRU'S SOCIALISM: THE 'GOD' THAT FAILED

*The whole political vision of the left, including socialism and communism, has failed by virtually every empirical test, in countries all around the world. But this has only led leftist intellectuals to evade and denigrate empirical evidence… When the world fails to conform to their vision, then it seems obvious to the ideologues that it is the world that is wrong, not that their vision is uninformed or unrealistic.*

#### —Thomas Sowell

All the above economic blunders of Nehru were thanks to his thrusting socialistic policies on poor India. Nehru uncritically accepted socialism. It is strange that while Nehru's books approvingly talk of Marxism and socialism, there is no comparative analysis by him of much more proven competing economic thoughts. It was as if Adam Smith, Alfred Marshall, JS Mill, John Maynard Keynes and others did not exist for Nehru. Nor did he care to read Milton Friedman (1912–2006) or Friedrich Hayek (1899– 1992).

Marxism and socialism were something Nehru was sold out on since the 1920s, wrote approvingly about in his books, advocated vigorously all through, and, unfortunately for India, implemented it post-independence in his own Nehruvian way. Nehru stuck to his position on socialism and communism despite the increasing evidence of their global failure, and the immense misery and totalitarianism they brought about. And, despite irrationally and unscientifically ignoring the facts and evidence, he flaunted himself as of a rational and scientific temperament.

Marxists call their socialism *scientific* socialism, as if the self-assigned, self-adulatory adjective *scientific* is sufficient to testify to it being scientific —correct; however preposterous it might be from a genuine scientific angle, where the litmus test is the real practical proof. Mere dialectics of selfserving arguments and logic does not result in truth! Marxism and socialism as a science or as an alternate economic thought for a nation to build on has miserably failed—it has globally been proven wrong both in theory and in practice.

To be a Marxist-communist "intellectual" is cheap and easy. Just get a hang on a set of jargons and delusional concepts: Historical Materialism,

Dialectical Materialism. Stages of Evolution of Society: Tribal, Feudal, Industrial–Capitalist—and, finally, Communist! Social Ownership of the Means of Production. Fascist, Imperialist. Proletariat, Bourgeois, Petty-Bourgeois. Dictatorship of the Proletariat. From Class to Classless Society. From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. Withering away of the state.

For these "intellectuals" sold out on "scientific" socialism there is no need to test and practically verify the above—for Marxism-Communism for them is the gospel truth, much like the totalitarian, proselytizing, exclusivist, "only-we-are-correct-and-all-others-false" ideologies of the latter two Abrahamic religions—Christianity and Islam. Like the us vs. them binary of Christianity and Islam—believers vs. non-believers; momins vs. kaffirs—Marxism-Communism has its binaries of proletariat vs. bourgeoisie, and worker vs. capitalist.

Those who do not genuinely understand science or scientific-methods are taken-in by mere allusion to something as *scientific* . Many became Marxists because being so implied being *scientific* -spirited, rational, progressive, pro-poor intellectual, aligned to the forces of history! Rather than being aligned to the forces of history or being on the right side of it, to the dismay of the Marxists, the unfolding history proved them to be on the wrong side; and their "science"—"scientific" socialism—turned out to be an alchemy!

Further, Marx didn't elaborate on the nature of society and organisation that would replace capitalism, and how it would be managed, except talking vaguely about the "dictatorship of the proletariat"—without allowing for the possibility of the Frankenstein it would unleash, and the surreal "1984" it would beget.

The capitalist economic thought, the capitalist societies and the associated democratic system themselves evolved and adapted since the time of Marx in such a way that they not only brought unprecedented prosperity to the concerned nations, they also significantly uplifted the status of the masses—falsifying, in the process, many of the foundations and assumptions of Marx.

In science, society, economics and indeed all disciplines knowledge evolves, concepts change, new theories replace old ones in the light of new experiments, experiences and knowledge gained. To be scientific is to keep

an open mind on things, to be willing to change, to be ready to jettison the old in the light of new evidence, and to go by actual practical results. For anything to be scientifically correct, it has to be proved truly and convincingly in practice, without a shadow of doubt. Till the same is done, it remains merely a conjecture, a hypothesis, a theory. Has the so-called scientific socialism or Marxism proved successful anywhere in the world in practice? No. Facts, figures, statistics and ground-level experiences of various countries prove that all brands of leftist politics—Communist, Socialist, Fabian, Nehruvian, and so on—are inherently incapable of delivering anything positive for any nation or for its poor. In fact, they have actually been at the root of poverty, want and stagnation.

Dismal fate of all nations that went socialist proves the point. Take USSR. It claimed to be following *scientific* socialism or Marxism. But, what were its practical results? It drew an iron-curtain so that no one got to see the disaster: the wide-spread poverty and famine and suppression of human rights. Had things been really good, why would USSR be so secretive about it, and not let those interested—journalists, writers, academicians, researchers, politicians, sociologists, and general public have unrestricted access and see the state of affairs for themselves, especially when they wanted other nations to emulate them, and go communist! Why only guided tours, under strict supervision? Whom were they fooling? Perhaps people like Nehru. One guided tour in 1920s, and Nehru returned fully sold out, like school-boys taken on guided tours! Subsequent guided-tours of both Nehru and his daughter post-independence to the USSR, and both were re-sold!! Ultimately the USSR fell apart, and all its parts are still struggling to throw away the bad old days of communism.

There is not a single example of a country which prospered or whose poor were better off under communism or socialism. The democratic countries like the UK which were going downhill with their socialistic policies did course correction under Thatcher and prospered. Extrapolating the time it took Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan to become first-world countries by adopting competitive capitalism, and the time it took West Germany and Japan to rise from the ashes of the Second World War by adopting capitalist economy, it seems reasonable that India would have been a prosperous, first-rate, first-world country by 1980 had it too adopted competitive capitalism and befriended the West.

Unfortunately for the crores of starving Indians and millions of others who had great hopes for themselves, their families and the nation after independence, Nehru guided India into a poverty-and-misery-perpetuating socialistic-bureaucratic black-hole. His descendants, Indira and Rajiv Gandhi, by doing much more of the same, made the situation worse. UPA-I and II, by part reverting to the Nehru-Indira disastrous ways, reversed the Narsimha Rao–Vajpayee upward trend.

Sardar Patel, Rajagopalachari and Rajendra Prasad were opposed to socialism. If only they had led India after Independence, rather than Nehru, India would have been a prosperous first-world country long ago, and it would hopefully have been saved from the debilitating feudal dynacracy (dynastic democracy) founded by Nehru, that is at the root of all miseries.

Nehru just went by what was popular and fashionable among the upper classes in Britain, without any deep study of economics (despite many years in jail where he had all the time in the world, and access to books), or even a reasonable understanding of its basics, although economics is a most vital subject for any political leader.

In fact, Nehru's prejudice—which he picked up at Harrow and Cambridge—against capitalism had more to do with his cultivating himself as an upper-class Englishman, who had a bias against trade, than on understanding of economics or economic history; just as his socialism had more to do with upper-class English Fabians (like Bernard Shaw), than with any genuine experience of or revolt against poverty. Nehru's class or caste bias is apparent in his autobiography{JN2} where he mentions that "right through history the old Indian ideal...looked down upon money and the professional money-making class" and that "today" it is "fighting against a new and all-powerful opposition from the bania [Vaishya] civilization of the capitalist West".

WHAT THEY SAID OF NEHRU & SOCIALISM

This permit-licence-raj is not a bee in my bonnet but a great boa-constrictor that has coiled itself around the economy.

*—Rajaji in Swarajya of 15.1.1966* {RG3/415}

To cure the British disease with socialism was like trying to cure leukaemia with leeches.

*—Margaret Thatcher*

Raja Vyapari taya Praja Bhikhari. *—Indian proverb*

Poor countries are poor because those who have power make choices that create poverty. Such countries develop "extractive" institutions

that "keep poor countries poor".

*—Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson,*

*'Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity and Poverty'*

(Socialist institutions tend to be extractive. Nehru was the founder of the extractive institutions that have been at the root of India remaining a thirdrate third-world nation.)

If you put the federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert, in 5 years there'd be a shortage of sand.

## *—Milton Friedman*

People who believe in evolution in biology often believe in creationism in government. In other words, they believe that the universe and all the creatures in it could have evolved spontaneously, but that the economy is too complicated to operate without being directed by politicians.

## *—Thomas Sowell*

Mr Jawaharlal Nehru returned from Cambridge with notions of how an allgoverning interventionist state can force people into happiness and prosperity through socialism...He sticks to this bias in spite of the demonstration of world experience against it... I hate the present folly and arrogance as much as I hated the foreign arrogance of those [British] days." *—Rajaji* {RG3/378}

> A young man who isn't a socialist hasn't got a heart; an old man who is a socialist hasn't got a head. *—David Lloyd George, the British PM in 1920*

Nehru's inability to rise above his deep-rooted Marxist equation of Western capitalism with imperialism, and his almost paranoid, partly aristocratic, distrust of free enterprise in its most successful form as 'vulgar', cost India dearly in retarding its overall development for the remaining years of his rule, as well as for the even longer reign of his more narrowly doctrinaire daughter.

*—Stanley Wolpert, 'Nehru: A Tryst with Destiny'* {Wolp2/447}

He [Nehru] had no idea of economics. He talked of Socialism, but he did not know how to define it. He talked of social justice, but I told him he could have this only when there was an increase in production. He did not grasp that. So you need a leader who understands economic issues and will invigorate your economy.

*—Chester Bowles, the then US Ambassador to India*

There is no difference between communism and socialism, except in the way of achieving the same ultimate goal: communism proposes to enslave men by force, socialism by voting. It's the same difference between murder and suicide.

## *—Ayn Rand*

The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money. *—Margaret Thatcher*

How do you tell a communist? Well, it's someone who reads Marx and Lenin. And how do you tell an anti-Communist? It's someone who understands Marx and Lenin.

### *—Ronald Reagan*

There was not much inhibition about asking for aid; and, according to some critics, not much gratitude. A frequent note was: aid should be bigger... The independence of the foodless or the heavily mortgaged debtor is normally precarious... Prices nearly doubled during the time I was in India... Further, the professional and the middle class, already ground down by taxation...as well as by inflation, sink lower in the economic scale...State intervention, too, grew apace under Nehru's plans. Permits, licenses, controls, foreign exchange prohibitions were always increasing. With them the corruption increased too...The parlous food position in India, including the low, and still falling, yield per acre was...dangerously concealed... through the millions of tons of free or dumped food from the Unites States...It is hard to escape the fear that the main achievement of Nehru's economic and social policy will turn out to be social disruption...And it is certain that over most of India the low standard of living in the villages has not risen; over much of India it has fallen, in the last ten years. Socialists governments, notoriously, run into difficulties over food production; as Communist China

did in recent years, and as Soviet Russia has been doing even forty-odd years after the Revolution...

*—Walter Crocker, 'Nehru: A Contemporary's Estimate'* {Croc/42-43}

I passed through some European capitals [in late 1950s] whose interest in India had shrunk because this country appeared to them more in the role of a client for aid than the leader of a new force in world affairs. The exception was West Germany, the only Western nation which shows respect for Indian culture. German Indologists study Sanskrit, whereas their British counterparts confine themselves to the Indo-Muslim period.{DD/354}

*—Durga Das in the context of the "aid" mentioned above by Crocker*
