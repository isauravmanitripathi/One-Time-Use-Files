## 12. EVEN MORE BLUNDERS & RELATED ASPECTS

## NEHRU GIFTED KABO VALLEY

The Kabo or Kabaw Valley is a 11,000+ sq km highland valley on the Indian-Burmese border that is sandwiched between Manipur and north Myanmar (Burma), and is peopled by ethnic minorities like Kadu, Kanan, Meitei, Mizo, Zo, etc. It is very fertile, and is well-known for its wood products, like teak.

There had been a number of wars between the Manipuris and the Burmese, and later among the Manipuris, the Burmese and the British. That Kabo Valley belonged to Manipur was confirmed through 'The Treaty of Yundabun' signed on 26 February 1825.{W.n11} Further, as per the treaty of 25 January 1834 signed at Langthabal between the British and Burmese Commissioners, the British Government was required to pay a monthly amount of 500 sicca rupees to the King of Manipur for leasing out Kabo Valley to the Burmese—the said monthly payment was being paid till 1949. {W.n11} The treaty also stipulated that the said monthly payment would cease as and when the Kabo Valley is reverted to Manipur. {W.n12}

Manipur gained independence from the British rule of 57 years (1891- 1947) in 1947, and two years later in 1949 it merged in the Indian union during the reign of (last) King Bodhachandra.

Nehru generously gifted (as if it was his personal property) the Kabo valley to Myanmar (Burma) as a token of peace, without taking the consent of the Parliament{W.n13} .

The preliminary friendly negotiations for the valley began in 1953 when the premiers of the two countries, Jawaharlal Nehru and U Nu visited Manipur and Nagaland, and finally was ratified by the Boundary Agreement between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the Union of Burma, signed at Rangoon on March 10, 1967, when Indira Gandhi was the PM.

PAYING RESPECTS TO BABAR!

Zahīr ud-Dīn Muhammad Babur(1483–1530), the Uzbekistan born direct descendant of the mass-murderer Tamerlane (Timur), was the founder of the Mughal dynasty in India, and was India's first Mughal Emperor from 1526 to 1530.

Tuzak-i Babari, Babur's autobiography, records Babur's campaign in northwest India of killing immense numbers of Hindu and Sikh civilians, and building towers of skulls of the infidels on hillocks. Baburnama too records massacre in Hindu-Sikh villages and towns. Babur desecrated and destroyed many temples. Guru Nanak was Babur's contemporary, and Nanak, in his 'Babur Bani', has described in detail the atrocities committed by Babur and his army, to which he was an eye-witness: "…Having attacked Khuraasaan, Babar terrified Hindustan. The Creator Himself does not take the blame, but has sent the Mughal as the messenger of death. There was so much slaughter... Those heads [of women] adorned with braided hair, with their parts painted with vermillion—those heads were shaved with scissors, and their throats were choked with dust... The order was given to the soldiers, who dishonoured them, and carried them away... Since Babar's rule has been proclaimed, even the princes have no food to eat... He burned the rest-houses and the ancient temples; he cut the princes limb from limb, and cast them into the dust..."{W.ih5}

Given the above no humanitarian or right-thinking person or an Indian patriot can ever think of paying respects to Babur.

But, Nehru and his dynasty appear to be an exception. Reproduced below are the extracts from the article 'Why Babur Beckons Nehru-Gandhis!': {W.n14}

*"1.Nehru visited Babur's grave on 19th Sept, 1959.*

*2.Indira Gandhi visited Babur's grave in 1968, as revealed by Natwar Singh in his book, Profile and Letters.*

*3.Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi visited Babur's grave in 1976.*

*4.Rahul, Dr Manmohan Singh and his Foreign Minister, Natwar Singh visited the grave of Babur in August 2005. The then National Security Adviser, M K Narayanan, had also accompanied the former P.M."*

*…The episode of Indira Gandhi bowing for a few minutes in silence at the grave of Babur in 1968, mentioned by Natwar Singh, did cause some*

*commotion among Hindu blog writers, but not of the mainstream English media."* {W.n14}

Significantly, none of the Nehru-Gandhis have ever cared to visit the grave/tomb of the brave Prithviraj Chauhan located in Ghazni, some distance away from Kabul.{W.n14}
