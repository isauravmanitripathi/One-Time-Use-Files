#### NEHRU'S DICTATORIAL WAYS

"Deep inside his heart, Nehru always was a dictator and first rate politician and manipulator. He feared only Gandhi and Patel—Gandhi because of his moral authority and complete grip on the masses, and Patel because of his firmness, unwillingness to be emotionally blackmailed and the writ in the party."

—*Historian Makkhan Lal* {Mak/251}

"The last straw has been our Prime Minister becoming a full-fledged dictator by contriving the ejection of Mr. P.D. Tandon from the Presidentship of the Congress and himself taking his place. I regard it as treachery to the nation to continue in the Congress in the face of this last development… A political murder committed yesterday is a murder of democracy in the Congress. This is merely the beginning of the slaughter of democracy in India."{Mak/308}

—*DP Mishra (Please also check Blunder#123)*

Nehru leveraged the democratic process to gain and retain power, but temperamentally, he was more a dictator than a democrat. He filled the top party posts and the cabinet with "yes-men" so that he could exercise unhindered power, and freely interfere in the workings of the party and ministries not under his direct charge.

Calling Nehru, for the first time, "the Congress dictator", C.R.[Rajaji] also said: "The single brain-activity of the people who meet in Congress is to find out what is in Jawaharlal's mind and to anticipate it. The slightest attempt at dissent meets with stern disapproval and is nipped in the bud."

—*Rajaji* {RG3/373}

Within months of his tenure as India's first PM, Nehru began acting whimsically and dictatorially without consulting the cabinet and the senior colleagues leading to the well-known rift with Sardar Patel. Patriotic and democratic Sardar Patel was forced to question Nehru's methods leading

even to Sardar's resignation in December 1947. The exchange of letters among Nehru, Sardar Patel and Gandhi between November-1947 and January-1948 clearly bring forth the issues of Nehru's dictatorial working. Sadly, Gandhi failed to correct Nehru prior to his assassination on 30 January 1948. (Please also check under Blunder#30 Patel's response to Gandhi in January 1950 on the PM's duties and powers.)

Even Acharya Kriplani resigned from the presidency of the Congress in November 1947 protesting timidity of India against Pakistan, its mishandling of the Kashmir issue, and demanding revocation of the standstill agreement signed with the Nizam of Hyderabad. Among the many disastrous results of Nehru's dictatorial working was his series of decision (that were really major blunders) on Kashmir, without taking his cabinet into confidence.

Once the stalwarts like Gandhi and Sardar Patel were no more, Nehru had a free, unbridled play! One can indulge the wise, rational, enlightened, and benevolent semi-dictatorship of people like Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore who within two decades took Singapore from a third-world country to a top first-world country; but can one indulge the blunders-afterblunders of a democratically-elected dictator like Nehru that condemned India to be third-rate third-world country.

This is what Dr Ambedkar had to say in his resignation letter (from the Nehru's cabinet) of 27 September 1951:

"The Cabinet has become a merely recording and registration office of decisions already arrived at by Committees. As I have said, the Cabinet now works by Committees… All important matters relating to Defence are disposed of by the Defence Committee. The same members of the Cabinet are appointed by them. I am not a member of either of these Committees. They work behind an iron curtain. Others who are not members have only to take joint responsibility without any opportunity of taking part in the shaping of policy…"

Wrote KM Munshi: "Jawaharlal was a dictator by temperament but had an intellectual aversion to dictators like Hitler and Stalin. He swore by the Constitution but was ever ready to defy or ignore it. Entrenched as he was in unlimited powers, he could never realise the harm that he was doing to the country by twisting the Constitution to his liking."{KMM},{Swa7}

John Mathai (1886–1959) was an economist who served as India's first Railway Minister and subsequently as India's Finance Minister between 1949 and 1951. Being pro-Nehru, he was initially prejudiced against Sardar Patel; but, he soon discovered Nehru's "feet of clay", and remarked:

"Under Nehru the Cabinet had never functioned, and all decisions were taken privately by the Prime Minister and the individual Minister concerned. Even when a decision was endorsed in the Cabinet, the Prime Minister went back on it and reversed the decision… The only time when the Indian Cabinet really functioned was when Nehru was away in Washington for a few weeks towards the end of October 1948 and when Sardar Patel was acting as Prime Minister. For the first time the cabinet functioned with joint responsibility; and the acting Prime Minister conducted meetings as the British Prime Minister would have."{BK/505}

For his honest and forthright views, especially on the Planning Commission, rather than allowing diversity of opinion and resolving issues democratically through discussions in the cabinet and other forums, John Mathai (then Finance Minister) was eased out by Nehru from the cabinet. {URL34}

How 'democratic' Nehru was would be clear from this extract from Neville Maxwell's book "India's China War":

"There was a Cabinet committee for foreign affairs but that, too, he [Nehru] ignored more often than not, and time and again crucial foreign policy decisions were taken and announced—even acted upon—without either the committee or the Cabinet being aware of them. This was true of the handling of the boundary question with China, which was kept not only from the Cabinet and its foreign affairs and defence committees, but also from Parliament until armed clashes made it impossible to suppress."{Max/91}

If you are arrogant and entertain false notions of your own ability, knowledge and understanding, then you either don't listen to others, or are dismissive of the opinions of the others; and tend to be undemocratic. You don't realise your own limitations; you don't realise you need to involve others, pool the expertise and then evolve a sensible joint solution. Observing your behaviour, people stop telling you the truth; instead they tell you only what you want to hear. You thus cut off honest opinions and feedback. Wrote Rustamji:

"…but when you talked to him [GB Pant, No. 2 in the Cabinet of Nehru], you saw the agility and quickness of a mind that was in strong contrast to his ponderous body. His thinking was quick, incisive: he talked cleverly and had few equals in debate. His English was perfect: and his manner of getting to the root of the problem enviable… Yet when Pant was in the presence of the PM, he was so respectful that he even lowered his standard of intelligence in order that the other may shine…"{Rust/194-95}

#### NEHRU—POWER TRUMPS PRINCIPLES

Despite being already in the powerful position of a PM, Nehru manoeuvred to also become the Congress Party President in 1951, and retained that position till 1954 to ensure a vice-like grip for himself both on the government and the party machinery—even though it flew in the face of the Congress Party principle of one-person-one-post. Nehru then released his presidency in 1955 to his lackey and a nobody like UN Dhebar, and allowed him to continue in that post right till 1959, after which he again manoeuvred to get his daughter Indira Gandhi elected as the party president in 1959.

Ironically, while he himself simultaneously held the post of the Party President and the PM, he got a similar setup banned at the state level—he got a party resolution passed in 1953 forbidding the state CMs from simultaneously holding a post in the PCC (Pradesh Congress Committee), on the ground that the CMs have too much office work to be able to devote time for the party work. (Didn't a PM have as much work? Height of hypocrisy!) Why? He didn't want the state CMs to get powerful, and ever challenge him, or his daughter later. Not only that, he gradually sidelined even the future competitors to his daughter Indira through the Kamaraj Plan of 1963, and other means, to ensure continuance of power for his dynasty. If someone should have first exited the government under the 1963 Kamaraj Plan it should have been Nehru himself for his 1962 India-China war debacle (Blunder#36), and for his failure in many other spheres.

Nehru was an agnostic, but his god was power. Principles were fine to enhance one's image, but if they came in the way of power for himself, and after him, for his dynasty, Nehru unhesitatingly and unscrupulously chose

power. Nehru ranted on secularism and against communalism and casteism, but when it came to selection of candidates for elections, both religion and caste were critical considerations for him, and for the Congress that was subservient to him. Nehru decried capitalists, but if they obliged his party by filling-in its election war-chest for a quid pro quo, Nehru's "principles" never came in the way. Socialism was not merely a fad for Nehru. What appealed to Nehru and his dynasty in socialism was its vote-gathering and power-grabbing potential by its appeal to the poor and the powerless.

# *Blunder–97 :*

### NEHRU CURBED FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

Indian constitution took a regrettable turn on 10 May 1951 when Nehru piloted the First Amendment to the Indian Constitution, that became a law, which, among other provisions, restricted freedom of expression (FoE) by amending Article 19(1)(a).

In sharp contrast to Nehru, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution did the reverse—it expanded the 'Freedom of Expression' (FoE): prohibited the making of any law respecting an establishment of religion, ensuring that there is no prohibition on the free exercise of religion, abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on the freedom of the press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble, or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances. This First Amendment, along with 9 others, was adopted on 15 December 1791, and constituted the Bill of Rights.

Nehru's amendment was perhaps provoked by the Supreme Court judgment of 1950 on the 'Romesh Thappar vs The State of Madras' case, through which the ban on Thappar's Marxist journal 'Crossroads' was lifted. Through the case, the Supreme Court had effectively recognized unfettered freedom of expression as compliant with our original Constitution, like in the US.

Thanks to Nehru's amendment above, poor Majrooh Sultanpuri, the famous and brilliant lyricist and poet, was thrown into Arthur Road jail in Mumbai in the early 1950s for a year for writing a verse critical of Nehru! {URL36} Dharampal (1922–2006), a highly regarded thinker-scholar, author of the ground-breaking book "The Beautiful Tree" among his many other

profound works, who had addressed an open letter to Nehru critical of the humiliating 1962 India-China war debacle, was also jailed by Nehru. Nehru was indeed terribly vicious and retributive towards his critics—and yet there are those who extol him for FoE.

During the Nehruvian era, a number of books, films and film songs that appeared directly or indirectly critical of the government were censored or banned. For example, the famous poet Pradeep's song in the film 'Amar Rahe Ye Pyaar' of 1961 was censored because of these lines: "Hai! Siyaasat kitni gandi; Buri hai kitni firqa bandi; Aaj ye sab ke sab nar-naari; Ho gaye raste ke ye bhikari."{URL44}

Nehru was not really a liberal in the classical sense, nor was he familiar with the intrinsic Hindu ethos of freedom of expression and free flow of ideas. Hinduism allows, and even encourages, people to discover their own truth.

Tibet Episode: Another Glaring Example of Nehru's Anti-FoE Stand

Please check the background and other details under "Blunder#33: Erasure of Tibet as a Nation". This is what Sita Ram Goel highlighted:

"But public opinion in India was exercised about Chinese occupation of Tibet as it meant a threat to India's own security, apart from suppression of Tibetan freedom. Nothing could be done immediately to mobilise public opinion and put pressure on the Government of India to change its China policy. It was only on August 22, 1953 that a meeting of leaders from various patriotic political parties, including Members of Parliament, decided to raise unofficial India's voice of protest against the continued occupation of Tibet. The meeting set up a Tibet Committee and announced a Tibet Day to be observed in September. But as soon as the news of this idea being mooted appeared in the press, the Prime Minister came out against it in a public statement issued the very next day. According to Hindustan Times dated August 26, 'He referred to a report that some persons proposed to hold a Tibet Day. He thought that it was ill-advised and asked members not to take any interest in it.' The meeting on August 22 had set up a Tibet Day Committee under the Chairmanship of Shri Gurupadaswami who was a Praja Socialist Party (PSP) Member of Parliament at that time. But another MP on the Committee, Prof N.G. Ranga, had to tender his resignation from the Committee on August 28 under pressure from the Prime Minister

with whose party he was at that time negotiating the merger of his own provincial Krishakar Lok Party in Andhra Pradesh."{SRG2/204}

"The Committee, however, did its duty by the country and the cause of human freedom in Tibet. More than eighty persons marched to the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi carrying placards and raising slogans asking Red China to vacate Tibet. Later on, a meeting was held in New Delhi Town Hall and addressed, among others by Shri Gurupadaswamy, Shri V.P. Joshi of the Jana Sangh and Munshi Ahmed Deen of the Praja Socialist Party."{SRG2/204}

"The Prime Minister felt annoyed with this effort. He put pressure on the press in New Delhi not to publish news of the Tibet Day demonstration and meeting. It became widely known in journalist circles those days that Feroze Gandhi, the son-in-law of the Prime Minister and a Director of the Express Group of newspapers at that time, explicitly ordered his chain everywhere not to report these events in the Capital."{SRG2/204}

"A few days later, the Prime Minister did something infinitely worse. Speaking on Foreign Affairs in the Rajya Sabha on September 23, he denounced and threatened the organisers of the Tibet Day in a language which was wild. He said: 'Sometimes—not often, I am glad to say some exuberant people organise some demonstration or other against friendly countries... They proclaim a *Tibet Day* . Why anyone should proclaim a Tibet Day passes my comprehension, more especially at this juncture. Who the genius was who suggested it or whose bright idea it was, I do not know. But anyhow here was this Tibet Day about ten days ago—nobody has noticed it—but a dozen to two dozen persons marched through the streets of Delhi to proclaim their love of Tibet and marched to the Chinese Embassy and demonstrated in front of it with loud cries. Well, it is rather childish, all this and extraordinary that grown-up persons should behave in this way and show up, because if a couple of dozen persons do this it does not indicate, if I may say so, any powerful body of opinion. In fact, it indicates their own smallness and folly. I mention this because it is perfectly ridiculous. I don't mind if anybody thinks so and wants to oppose us, not in argument or debate or even in public streets. Well, if he goes beyond a certain limit, any Government will have to take action. We don't take any action normally speaking. We have not, but what I want this House to consider is the extreme, well I use the word 'folly', of such activities. Members of this

House do not attach any importance to it, I know. But there is the rest of the world which exaggerates and which may be interested in exaggerating these incidents which come at a moment when we seek help in delicate matters in developing a spirit of friendly cooperation and tries to create trouble.'"{SRG2/205}

"This statement was full of insinuations. Here was the Prime Minister of a democratic country showing extreme intolerance for, and interfering publicly with other people's freedom to think and express opinion about matters which concerned the security of the nation. The Communist Party of India and its fronts had built up before his own eyes a formidable apparatus which was leading demonstrations, every now and then, against this or that foreign embassy, and heaping the foulest possible abuse on several friendly countries. The Prime Minister has, to this day, never uttered a word against even acts of hooliganism enacted by the communists outside those embassies—burning cars, stoning, and manhandling office staff. But a small and dignified protest on the part of some patriots to draw the attention of their people and Government to the threat posed by China's illegal invasion of a buffer State, made the Prime Minister furious and robbed him of all sense of proportion and propriety. The Prime Minister had shown himself partial to a communist cause in utter disregard of national interest. In the process, he had made himself utterly ridiculous as well. On the one hand he said again and again that the protesters against China were only a few people who represented no one except themselves. On the other hand he chose to spend so much breath and create the impression that the event was very important. His threat of action against the protesters, of course, was nothing short of criminal."{SRG2/205-6}

"DEMOCRACY, THANKS TO NEHRU?"—NOT TRUE

Not seldom are those who tend to be critical of Nehru reminded it is thanks to Nehru India is a democracy, whose fruits all Indians are enjoying —including criticising him. Does the contention hold?

Elections were conducted in India during the British times too. Congress had not only won the 1937-elections and formed ministries in many states; post elections, with power in their hands, they had already become so corrupt that Gandhi had desired disbanding of Congress after independence. The last pre-independence elections were held in 1946. Independent India inherited many democratic institutions, including election machinery—only it needed a boost to handle universal suffrage.

It was, in fact, the Constitution of India framed under Dr Ambedkar, and passed by the Constituent Assembly comprising scores of worthies and headed by Dr Rajendra Prasad, which had provided for universal adult franchise and democratic setup. So, how can the credit be given to Nehru?

Nehru's own election as the President of Congress in 1946, that led to his becoming India's first prime minister upon independence, was undemocratic. For details, please see Blunder#6.

In the long-term interest of the nation, a responsible democrat would have assiduously worked to establish a multi-party, or at least a two-party democratic system. However, too keen for himself and his dynasty to forever remain in power, Nehru saw to it that India's nascent democracy was not nurtured for a robust opposition. He tried all the tricks to defame, belittle and weaken the opposition.

How can a person like Nehru who introduced dynastic politics (next 'blunder') into India be called a democrat? The biggest menace threatening India is not corruption or lack of governance or reforms or Babudom, but dynasty, because that is at the root of all others. Nehru never worked to make India a really mature democracy. His exertions were to actually turn it into a hereditary, Nehru-dynastic democracy. In doing so, as a collateral to dynacracy (dynastic democracy), India also turned into a nepoticracy, feudocracy, and chamchacracy.

### *Blunder–99 :*

#### NEHRU PROMOTED DYNACRACY, NOT DEMOCRACY

#### MOTILAL PROMOTES JAWAHARLAL

Jawaharlal Nehru was unfairly promoted by his father, Motilal Nehru; and in the true dynastic tradition, Nehru promoted Indira, who in turn, even more shamelessly promoted her progeny. When Motilal Nehru retired as the

Congress president in 1929, he made sure by lobbying with Gandhi that his son, Jawaharlal, ascended the gaddi, over the heads of people much more senior and capable than him. Please check Blunder#1.

NEHRU PROMOTES HIS SISTER VIJAY LAKSHMI PANDIT

On how Nehru favoured his sister, please check Blunder#11. Wrote S. Nijalingappa in 'My Life and Politics'{Nij/102} :

"Another such instance I remember was when Dr. S. Radhakrishnan was president of India...I used to call on him whenever I was in Delhi...In his talks with me, as I believe with others too, he was very frank and open. One day, when I went to him he said, 'Nijalingappa, today I put my foot down. Do you know why?' He then continued, 'Pandit Nehru comes to me and wants me to make his sister, Vijay Lakshmi Pandit, vicepresident of India. I had to tell him, "You are the prime minister of India, your daughter is the president of Indian National Congress and you want your sister to be vice-president. What would people say? I cannot have it." I put my foot down and sent him away.' I think Nehru had promised his sister the post and when she could not get it, she was very angry with her brother. She complained to me about it when she came to my house for breakfast, and said that her brother did not keep his promise. I did not tell her what Dr S. Radhakrishnan had told me."{Nij/102}

### NEHRU PROMOTES INDIRA GANDHI

Although Indira Gandhi had done little work for the Congress, she was made a member of the Congress Working Committee in 1955—entry directly from the top, rather than rising from the bottom. In 1957, Indira was made member of the powerful Central Election Committee.

Durga Das writes in his book{DD} that in 1957 in his weekly column in Hindustan Times he wrote Nehru was building up his daughter for succession. He says he had checked with Maulana Azad before writing the column, and Azad had said he too had independently reached the same conclusion. Even Govind Ballabh Pant had the same opinion. Later, when Nehru remonstrated with Durga Das on the column, to mollify Nehru, Durga Das assured him that what he had written would bring good publicity to Indira and would stand her in good stead—at which Nehru felt happy and smiled.{DD/370}

In 1958, Indira became a member of the Central Parliamentary Board— Nehru made a vacancy for her by himself resigning from the Board: a deft

move! She was then made President of the Congress in 1959, to the astonishment of all, after an intense behind the scenes drama, managed through others by Nehru. Nehru had thus commented on her being made the President: "I am proud of Indira Gandhi as my daughter, my comrade and now as my leader. It is superfluous for me to say that I love her. I am proud of her integrity and truthfulness."

Wrote Rajmohan Gandhi: "Suddenly, at this juncture, Indira Gandhi, Jawaharlal's daughter, was named party president. Her talents were yet a secret, and she had no experience of party work. Several of Nehru's colleagues were offended by the choice but said nothing. C.R. [Rajagopalachari] was outraged."{RG3/373}

Kuldip Nayar wrote: "This was where I first heard that Congress President V.N. Dhebar was resigning and Indira Gandhi was taking over. Pant had supported Nehru at Vinoba's ashram but not at the CWC when Indira Gandhi was nominated as the party president. He was careful not to oppose Nehru's daughter directly but argued that her frail health would come in the way of the extensive travels the Congress president was required to undertake. Raising his voice, Nehru told Pant that 'she was healthier than both of us' and could put in longer hours of work. The subsequent discussions, as I noted, were to fix the date on which she would assume charge*.* This was the first time that dynastic politics came to the fore, and the Congress since then has been following the practice of invariably having a member of Nehru family at the helm of affairs...Left to Nehru, he would have liked Indira to succeed him as prime minister, but too many Congress leaders, with a long stint of sacrifice and struggle for the country's freedom, were still on the scene at the time."{KN}

Nehru had also started developing Indira as a public figure. By making her the official host, Nehru gave her exposure to foreign dignitaries and guests. Nehru also sent her on various foreign assignments like India's representative to the UNESCO's Executive Board, and tour of foreign countries on Nehru's behalf.

After the 1962-debacle, and his plunging popularity, Nehru used the Kamaraj Plan of 1963 to clear the way for Indira from the seniors. Morarji Desai, who had not objected then, later told Michael Brecher about the Kamaraj Plan: "It seemed to have been motivated not only to get rid of him [Morarji] but also to pave the way for Mrs Gandhi to the Prime

ministership, just as Motilal [Nehru] had passed on the Congress presidency to him (Nehru)."{IM2}

Acharya Kripalani believed that the evils in the country emanated from the top and that Nehru was the pace-setter in abusing patronage and power. {DD/371}

One may say that Nehru did not make Indira Gandhi the PM. But, he was working towards it. However, before he could fulfil his mission he passed away. Though he had done the ground work—given the necessary visibility to her. Lal Bahadur Shastri had himself told that "in Panditji's mind is his daughter". Writes Kuldip Nayar: "I ventured to ask Shastri one day: 'Who do you think Nehru has in mind as his successor?' 'Unke dil main to unki saputri hai [In his heart is his daughter],' said Shastri...Nijalingappa said he was pretty sure that Nehru had his daughter in mind as his successor. In his diary, he wrote on 15 July 1969 that Nehru 'was always grooming her for the prime-ministership obviously and patently'."{KN}

Wrote MO Mathai: "A couple of years ago Vijaya Lakshmi asked me, 'Why did Bhai [Nehru] drop me completely during the last phase of his life?' I did not wish to answer that question at the time, and managed to change the subject. I have already given in this chapter part of the reason. The other part is that Nehru did not want to build up a rival to his daughter who was much younger. More about this in the chapter on Indira!"{Mac/142}

NEHRU LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF DYNACRACY: DYNASTIC DEMOCRACY

Democracy grafted on a nation with a strong feudal mindset is likely to degenerate into dynacracy, unless the leaders who matter consciously devote themselves to ensuring it does not happen, both by setting an example themselves and by putting in place appropriate systems. Nehrus did the reverse. The dynastic politics that Nehru started and thus sanctified, and what was even more shamelessly promoted by his daughter, has now vitiated and poisoned our whole democratic system. Following in the footsteps of Motilal, Jawaharlal and Indira, now most leaders promote their own dynasty in politics. We are now already in the era of blooming dynacracy! It has become all pervasive and has vitiated and poisoned our democratic system. The whole democratic process would soon get reduced to jockeying for power among select dynasties!

It's not just Nehru's heirs—we now have heirs in nearly every state. Abdullah & Sons and Mufti's daughter in J&K; Mulayam Singh Yadav, Son

& Family in UP; Badal & Sons in Punjab; Chautala & Sons, Hooda & Sons in Haryana; Lalu-Rabri & Sons in Bihar; Sharad Pawar & Daughter & Nephew, Thackery & Sons & Nephew in Maharashtra; YSR's Family in Andhra; KCR & Family in Telangana; Karunanidhi & Sons in Tamil Nadu; and, of course, spouses and sons and daughters and relatives of many other politicians. Many constituencies are now private estates.

As per a study detailed in Patrick French's book 'India: A Portrait'{PF2} , about 28.6% of the MPs in the Indian parliament are HMPs—Hereditary MPs. Even more revealing are the figures that while over two-thirds of the 66 MPs aged 40 years or less are HMPs, all the MPs below 30 are HMPs! Going by this trend, we would soon be back to where we were in the "good" old pre-independence period: ruled by hereditary rajas and maharajas and princes. Strangely, this trend was started by the one who vexed most eloquent against rajas, maharajas and the feudal setup in the pre-independence days—Jawaharlal Nehru.

#### DEFENDING THE INDEFENSIBLE: DYNACRACY

Among the biggest crimes of the Nehru Dynasty is that they have taken the guilt and the shame out of dynastic politics, and have encouraged others to follow suit, through their example. However, India is a country whose culture and thinking has been so vitiated by the dynasts and their hangerson and direct and indirect beneficiaries that even the indefensible—dynastic democracy—is defended. Dynacracy-tolerant "intellectuals" often question: Are the dynasts trying to get in undemocratically? No. Then, what is the problem. If one fights an election, gets elected, and becomes a political leader, what illegality or wrong is committed—everything is democratic and above board.

Although obviously absurd, one is not surprised to hear such pleas. What is happening dynasty-wise, be it Nehru-Gandhi or DMK or Lalu or any of the scores of other dynasties, is so obviously wrong that it should neither attract any defence, nor any arguments to demolish that defence. However, the original Dynasty has been able to do such publicity over the decades through the compliant MSM, intellectuals and netas that the reverse has happened: questioning the dynastic succession has become questionable!

A prominent argument advanced goes like this. Dhirubhai Ambani's sons are also businessmen. That is, businessmen's wards generally become businessmen. Progeny of artists—singers, musicians, writers, and othersalso become artists. Sons and daughters of Bollywood actors also become actors. Doctor's wards also become doctors. Farmer's son is often a farmer. Dynasty is everywhere. So why pick on only political dynasties? This superficial argument can fool only the gullible. Progeny of doctors, artists, actors, businessmen becoming also doctors, artists, actors, businessmen affect them only, not others. However, progeny of a neta/politician becoming a neta affects people at large. It is the requirement of a democracy to be representative and hence non-dynastic. Business houses or art houses or professional establishments are not required to be representative.

In politics too, you once had hereditary rajas and maharajas and kings and queens. But the days of those retrograde systems are gone—now replaced by a democratic system. In a way, therefore, hereditary or dynastic succession is unconstitutional. Then, why bring it in from the backdoor. It is against the spirit of the Constitution. Dynastic succession is feudal, inappropriate, unjust, and harmful for the nation, whether it happens in the communist North Korea or the Islamic Saudi Arabia or in the democratic or dynacratic India.

To the pro-dynasty "Don't they fight elections and win" argument, the question is: How do they win? A far more competent competitor would not even get the party-ticket. But for the dynasty scion, it is for the asking. They get on a platter the constituency nursed for years by their parents. And they have money to splurge to get elected. After getting elected, a high position within the party-organisation or the government is assured to them something denied to the many much more competent but less-connected contenders. The whole thing is unjust, unfair and undemocratic.

The sophists question: "Are you saying that children of a politician should be denied a political career? Would that be democratic?" It is not that the progeny or relatives of a politician should be denied a political career. Only thing is that they should not be allowed to derive an unfair advantage. That is possible when things are enforced to be genuinely democratic, nepotism is rooted-out, and talent and ability take the frontseat. Is there any inner-party democracy in the political parties? What if the person from the so-called dynasty also has merit? Well, does he or she have more merit compared to the many with merit? If yes, fine. But, let there be a fair comparison, competition and debates.

### WHY IS DYNACRACY DISASTROUS?

Dynacracy (Dynastic Democracy) is bad not just because we resent some having unfair advantage, it is bad because it results in mediocrity, and it discounts merit. The quality of leadership emerging out of a dynastic process can never be really good. For proof, check for yourself the unutterable underachievements of the underwhelming leadership of the dynasts, at the state or at the Centre, and how it has become worse and worse down the generation: for example, the reverse geometric progression of woefully falling standards from Nehru down to Rahul Gandhi!

Don't those who defend dynasties on the specious plea that "after all they get elected" realise that it is thanks to their running, or rather, running down the country for decades that India could do no better than rank among the poorest and the most corrupt countries in the world and remains in "dark" ages as a third-world country.

The principal hazards of dynasty politics are the following: (a)It discounts merit and prevents competent from rising. (b)It thwarts internal democracy in political parties. (c)Dynastic politics, nepotism, institutionalised corruption and non-accountability go together. (d)Dynastic politics is always at the expense of the nation. (e)It is the biggest menace. It's the foundation of India's misery.

#### NOT LIMITING THE TERM OF THE PM

If Nehru was a true democrat, he should have taken a page out of the US Constitution, and limited the term of a prime minister to just two terms like the President of the US. Not only that, on completion of two terms passing on the baton to one's kin should also have been prohibited, to ensure dynasties did not take over politics. Dynasties have a vested interest in continuance at the expense of the nation. They also have a vested interest in covering up all the wrong doings of the dynasty.

Following Nehru's footsteps, you find a strange spectacle of people whether young or old, and whether in a political position or a bureaucratic position or a position in a sports body—not wanting to ever quit. Where

extension is not possible, bureaucrats would seek some position or the other post retirement.

Contrast the above with George Washington, co-founder of the USA. He was proclaimed the "Father of the Country" and was elected the first president of USA in 1789 with virtually no opposition. Washington retired in 1797, firmly declining to serve for more than eight years—two terms despite requests to continue. His tremendous role in creating and running America notwithstanding, he didn't harbour or propagate self-serving notions of indispensability. The 22nd amendment to the US constitution setting a maximum of only two terms for the president came only in 1947. Prior to that it was only an observed good practice for over a century.

Thomas Jefferson, the third President and one of the founding fathers of the US, famous for his many achievements and for having originally drafted the Declaration of Independence of the US in 1776, was also requested, pressurised and persuaded to consider continuing as President after completion of two terms in 1808, on account of his excellent performance on multiple counts—during his tenure the geographical area of the USA almost doubled, upon purchase of Louisiana from the French, which in turn ended the dispute about the navigation of the Mississippi. However, stressing the democratic and republican ideals, Jefferson refused, even though there was no legal bar then, and people would have loved him to continue.

Had the above "Maximum 8 Years" rule been followed, Nehru-Raj would have folded up by 1955. Had that happened, India would have been spared Nehru's poverty-perpetuating socialism, India-China war debacle, debilitating Nehru-Dynasty rule, and the plethora of blunders recounted in this book.

#### NOT APPOINTING A SUCCESSOR, DELIBERATELY

Wrote Perry Anderson: "For the rest of the union, the lasting affliction of Nehru's rule has been the dynastic system he left it. He claimed to reject any dynastic principle, and his capacity for self-deception was perhaps great enough for him to believe he was doing so. But his refusal to indicate any colleague as a successor, and complaisance in the elevation of his daughter

—with no qualifications other than her birth for the post—to the presidency of Congress, where Gandhi had once placed him for his own trampoline to power, speak for themselves."{URL8}

Nehru did not appoint a senior cabinet minister or a deputy prime minister (after the death of Sardar Patel) to function in his absence when he went abroad. A responsible prime minister would have done so, and would have scotched all speculations on "After Nehru, who?" In fact, as stressed in the previous blunder, a responsible, patriotic leader would have refused to remain the prime minister after a period of eight years (1947-55), and would have handed that position to another capable leader—and there were many who would have handled the portfolio in a far better manner. But Nehru deliberately did not do so both to show to the world how indispensable and irreplaceable he was, and to make way for his daughter. Nehru thus sacrificed national interests for personal dynastic interests.

Wrote Walter Crocker: "It is no less strange that Nehru clung to office for so long. It would have been of help to the cause of parliamentary democracy in India if he had stood down...This is what Kemal Ataturk did...For one thing his long domination sapped the opposition; the opposition is an essential part of parliamentary democracy..."{Croc/55}

Nehru, despite having ruled too long, did not think it fit to pass the baton to anyone, even though it was not as if the country was doing great during his time, and his not being there would have adversely affected the nation. On the contrary, with him not there, things might have improved, provided, of course, the baton had not been passed to his daughter!

Contrast Nehru with Sardar Patel, who had told his son and grandson, when they visited him after he suffered a heart-attack in Delhi: "As long as I am in this chair, don't visit Delhi, unless I am unwell and you have to see me...All sorts of people will contact you. Take care."{RG/473}

### *Blunder–102 :*

#### ELECTION FUNDING & PUBLICITY

One of the main causes of corruption is election funding. That was the only area for which Rajaji advocated nationalisation. Rajaji had advocated state funding of elections to help eliminate the overwhelming advantages of

money-power. He commented: "*Elections now are private enterprise, whereas this is the first thing to be nationalised* ."{RG3/390}

But, Nehru did not listen. Nehru nationalised what he should not have, and did not nationalise what he should have—the state-funding of elections. Had he done so, one could have said he was genuinely a true democrat. It would have helped the poor opposition take roots in the nascent democracy. Opposition was starved of funds. Besides, they did not have any publicity machinery at their disposal.

Nehru ranted against capitalists, but if they obliged his party by filling-in its election war-chest for a quid pro quo, Nehru's "principles" never came in the way. As all the election funding was being received by the Congress —of course, in expectation of quid pro quo—why would Nehru have tried to strengthen the Opposition by arranging funding for them? Nehru took care to jealously guard the large donations received by the Congress from corporates.

When Rajaji, deeply concerned with Nehru's economic policies taking India to dogs, formed Swatantra Party with like-minded persons, and fought the elections, Nehru dubbed them as pro-money-bags. Those adjectives remained stuck to them, even though it was the Congress Party which was getting all the money from the money-bags, and Swatantra Party was finding it very hard to find money to fight elections.

Later, when JRD Tata, impressed with the radical free-market agenda of the Swatantra Party of Rajaji as opposed to Nehru's poverty-perpetuating socialism, proposed contributing to the Swatantra Party, Nehru angrily objected, and when JRD still went ahead, Nehru took his revenge in various ways.{W.n15}

Nehru, his government, and the Congress Party monopolised radio, the main mass communication medium in the pre-TV days. There was a demand to make All India Radio (AIR) an autonomous body; and even Nehru had once stated that he would like the AIR to be modelled on the lines of BBC; but looking to its huge reach, and the tremendously unfair advantage it provided him of hogging all publicity, Nehru conveniently forgot restructuring and reforming it. AIR never made any adverse comments on Nehru or his policies or the government. AIR became the propaganda vehicle of Nehru, and later his dynasty, providing no space to the opposition.

Nehru and the Congress used carrot and stick to ensure the print-media was compliant. Nehru's pictures, statements and speeches used to crowd out the views and comments of the opposition. Government's vast Publication Division was dedicated to publishing all kinds of selected and collected works and letters and speeches of Nehru and his mentor Gandhi, but steered clear of giving any importance to the far better works and letters and speeches of Sardar Patel or Netaji Bose or Dr Ambedkar. PIB's (Press Information Bureau) photographic department liberally released photos of Nehru on various occasions providing him vast publicity.

Nehru and his dynasty so misused and manoeuvred the AIR, the government-controlled institutions, the academia, and the media as to project a picture and an impression to the public at large that only they could lift India out of poverty, that only they could keep India united, that only they knew how to govern a country as big and varied, that only they could protect the minorities and the weaker sections, and that they alone could be saviours of India! In short, Nehru and his dynasty tried all their tricks to ensure India remained a one-Party-dominated democracy; and that their dynasty remained overwhelmingly dominant in that party. What could have been a more irresponsible, and a worse disservice to the nation!

#### ENSURING SELF-PUBLICITY & DYNASTIC RECALL

#### Children's Day

An interesting thing is the Children's Day—14th November, Nehru's birthday. November-20 was declared by the United Nations as the Universal Children's Day. However, it was shifted in India to November-14 to coincide with Nehru's birthday. In the "good" old days it used to be celebrated with much fanfare. It used to be said, and it is propagated so even now, that Nehru loved children, and hence, his birthday was celebrated as the Children's Day. However, you realise that all love children. There could be a negligible psychic minority who hate children or do not like or love them. Then, what was so special about Nehru? Upon analysis, you conclude that this was yet another way of obtaining free publicity and acceptability for the dynasty. Influence people from the childhood itself to

be pro-dynasty! Popularise yourself with a wide audience very conveniently. Make them all—both children and parents—feel positively and lovingly about you.

*The fact is, if Nehru ever indeed loved children, they were his own children (rather, only child Indira) and his grand-children* . Otherwise, Nehru was distinctly uncomfortable with children. Wrote Rustamji:

"Few would know that his [Nehru's] attitude towards children was not what people believe—a desire to play with tiny-tots. In fact, the really small ones he never tackled. In my six years with him, I have never seen him taking a baby in his arms; nor were they the receivers of his attention."{Rust/72}

"JN [Jawaharlal Nehru] built up his image in very clever ways. Even after knowing him for nearly six years, I was not in a position to say which was the real Nehru and which was the sham. When he bent down to lift up a child, or throw a garland at a woman, I wondered whether it was for the camera or for his popularity that he did it… He was putting on an act all the time; acting well undoubtedly, but acting all the same and for what?"{Rust/124}

### Namakarans Unlimited

Then, you have "namakarans" unlimited. Throw a pebble in any direction anywhere in India. The statistical chance of it hitting something named after Motilal or Jawahar or Kamala or Indira or Rajiv are frighteningly high. Sharp dynastic practices indeed, artfully ensuring massive free publicity at government's cost—a la Kim-Il-Jung of North Korea!

An article{W.n4} by Prof Vaidyanathan on the web provides a detailed list of items named after the Nehru-Gandhi family. As per the same{W.n4} , 12 Central Government Schemes; 52 State Government Schemes; 28 Sports, Tournaments, and Trophies; 19 Stadiums; 5 Airports and Ports; 98 Universities and Educational Institutes; 52 Awards; 15 Scholarships and Fellowships; 15 National Parks, Sanctuaries, and Museums; 39 Hospitals and Medical Institutions; 21 Institutions, Chairs, and Festivals have been named after the Nehru-Gandhis, aggregating to a massive grand total of 356 —and this excludes bridges, roads, traffic-squares, markets and many other items.

Why JNNURM—Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission after Jawaharlal, under whose regime India was condemned to make do

with meagre, rickety infrastructure, and side-lane like highways. Why not name it on someone like Visvesvaraya, the distinguished engineer, who was the architect of Krishnarajasagara dam and Brindavan Gardens, and had many engineering achievements to his credit?

Why JNU—Jawaharlal Nehru University? Nehru's academic achievements were rather modest. Wrote MJ Akbar: "Eventually when he [Jawaharlal] passed in the second half of the second class, Motilal was relieved enough to celebrate lavishly...Motilal was acutely terrified that his son might fail, so even such moderate results were cause for celebrations..."{Akb/74-77}

Why IGNOU—Indira Gandhi National Open University? She was not even a graduate! You see poor boys and girls in the most backward regions of India doing graduation and post-graduation under trying circumstances, and here you have a person, with all the financial and family support, and even expenses for education abroad, not doing even graduation.

Then, why name these important, national universities after such persons? Why not name them after Ambedkar who earned a double doctorate from abroad despite heavy odds and extremely meagre resources? Or, after other great academics or scientists like say CV Raman, the Nobel Laureate, or SN Bose, or JC Bose, or Panini. Or, after other national leaders like Dr Rajendra Prasad, Dr Radhakrishnan, Subhas Bose, Rajaji, Sardar Patel who were also great academics. High time "Nehru-Gandhi Namakarans Unlimited" are reversed, and limited to just a reasonable few.

As per an article on rediff.com: "The Americans named their new, orbiting, X-ray observatory 'Chandra' after Subrahmanyam Chandrasekhar, the physicist; it occurred to me that if India were to ever send up a space telescope, it would almost certainly be named 'Jawahar'. Apparently no one else in India matters!"{W.n6}

# *Blunder–104 :*

### COMMUNAL, VOTE-BANK POLITICS

Congress which tom-toms its secular credentials started its communal politics from the Nehruvian era itself. Massive Muslim migrations from East-Bengal were ignored to get Muslim votes to win elections in Assam.

When asked, Nehru had advised even a person of the stature of Maulana Azad to contest elections from a predominantly Muslim area, despite Zakir Hussain's hang-ups, keeping in mind the secular faith of the Congress vote-bank politics took precedence.

Since the Nehruvian times, Congress played on the insecurity of dalits and Muslims to get their votes, without really doing anything concrete to make them feel secure and equal citizens of independent India. Neither the exploitation and ill-treatment of dalits was stopped, nor the communal riots halted, nor were they offered better economic opportunities. In short, the Nehru-Gandhi-Dynasty-perpetuation formula is this: Talk secular always, but play communal politics to get votes.

Project Congress as pro-poor, pro-minority, pro-dalit and prodisadvantaged. However, let the poor remain poor forever, and let the minorities and dalits feel insecure forever—how else to get their votes?

Wrote Durga Das: "But Azad revised his opinion of Nehru in the last two years of his life… Towards the end of his life, Azad realised that the best protection for the Muslims was the goodwill of the Hindus and a strong government. He told me…that Nehru's policies had weakened the administration and that his economic theories had failed to improve the living conditions of the people, especially the Muslims."{DD/377-8}

### PROMOTING INCOMPETENTS & SYCOPHANTS

*Servitude debases men to the point where they end up liking it.* —Luc de Clapiers

Nehru's hubris was such that he thought he was the wisest person around who knew best. He, therefore, looked for "Yes-men". Those who would toe his line, do his bidding, and even anticipate his likes and dislikes, and act accordingly.

The single brain-activity of the people who meet in Congress is to find out what is in Jawaharlal's mind and to anticipate it. The slightest attempt at dissent meets with stern disapproval and is nipped in the bud.

—*Rajaji* {RG3/373}

Wrote MO Mathai: "Barring a few exceptions, more especially after Sardar Patel's death, Nehru's colleagues were not men who would frankly speak out in his presence. Many were tongue-tied before him, some were ever anxious not to displease him, and some tried to find out in advance what was likely to please him. Nearly all had an awe of him. The net result, was that Nehru was not well served by his colleagues."{Mac2/L-5751}

No wonder the frank, forthright and competent were sidelined. This became glaringly obvious in the way Nehru and Menon played favourites in the army, politicised postings and promotions, and awarded top positions to those who ultimately let India down in the 1962 India-China war. Please check Blunder#38.

The position was such in the first general elections in 1952 that whoever got a Congress ticket was likely to win. It was said that even a lamp-post carrying a Congress ticket would win. Gandhi had desired after independence that honest, competent and deserving persons from varied spheres willing to serve the country must be inducted. 1952 was a golden opportunity to identify and induct such persons. But, did Nehru do so? No. Nehru had a free hand. He herded-in as many loyalists and sycophants as he could.

Maulana Azad had commented: "We are still feudal, but what has distressed me is that many good persons have been denied tickets because the trusted courtiers had labelled them as anti-Nehru."{Azad}

Nehru even saw to it that Dr BR Ambedkar—by far the most erudite and competent—was defeated! Expectedly, the 1952-election results threw up a large band of Congress MPs and MLAs who were courtiers, sycophants and hangers-on.

Nehru promoted and consulted people like Krishna Menon, about whom Khushwant Singh who had worked in the Indian High Commission in London under him had the following to say in his autobiography 'Truth, Love and a Little Malice':{KS}

"I had briefly met Krishna Menon in my college days and had not detected any signs of genius [as claimed by some] in him. He was a sourtempered barrister without briefs and spent his energies building up his India League and paying court to Pandit Nehru whenever he was in England. His appointment as High Commissioner was badly received in India and the Indian community in England as gross favouritism.{KS/118}

"...he set up many sub-organisations of his India League and got money from rich Indians and his English friends as donations to his organisations; in return, he gave the latter contracts for supply of arms to India. He had no scruples in business matters. He was also a congenital liar and regarded truth as good enough for the simple-minded and lying as the best exercise for the mind.{KS/143}

"...Why Menon got where he did under the patronage of Pandit Nehru remains, and probably will remain, unexplained.{KS/152}

"...General Shiv Varma summed him up aptly when he said, 'Menon was a bachelor, the same as his father.'"{KS/153}

Wrote Louis Fischer: "Without free criticism and potent opposition, democracy dies. Without political criticism and opposition, a nation's intellect, culture and public morality stagnate; big men are purged and small men become kowtowing pygmies. The leaders surround themselves with cowards, sycophants and grovelling yes-men whose automatic approval is misread as a tribute to greatness."

David Lloyd George, the British PM during 1916-22, had advised Winston Churchill : "It is important for a Prime Minister to be surrounded by people who could stand up to him and say, not once but thrice, 'No'." One wonders if it was Nehru's hubris, dictatorial mindset, overt arrogance, or covert inferiority complex that made him shun stalwarts like Patel, Ambedkar, and embrace sycophants, grovelling pygmies, and lesser persons.

All those who opposed Nehru were disparaged, labelled non-secular and communal, or pro-rich, or fascists, and weeded out. Gradually, a coterie around Nehru vigorously spread his defective pseudo-secular, anti-Hindu, poverty-perpetuating socialistic claptrap, and sidelined all those who refused to toe Nehru's line. Leaders who differed exited, and leaders who remained became parrots, bereft of individuality and fresh ideas. Commented DP Mishra: "Gandhiji made heroes out of clay, but under Pundit Nehru's leadership they are being turned into corpses."{DPM2/262}

### *Blunder–106 :*

#### NEHRU'S DEFECTIVE WORLD VIEW

Much of Nehru's defective world view has already been covered and illustrated with examples above. We now take up those aspects that have either not been covered, or have been inadequately covered above.

NEHRU'S BLINKERED MARXIST–COMMUNIST WORLD VIEW

Marxism and socialism were something Nehru was sold out on since the 1920s. (For details on the Nehruvian Economics/Socialism, please check Blunder#64-70.) This is what Nehru said in his presidential address at the Lucknow session of the Congress in 1936:

"I am convinced that the only key to the solution of the world's problems and of India's problems lies in socialism, and when I use this word I do so not in a vague humanitarian way but in the scientific, economic sense. Socialism is, however, something even more than an economic doctrine; it is a philosophy of life and as such also it appeals to me. I see no way of ending the poverty, the vast unemployment, the degradation and the subjection of the Indian people except through socialism. That involves vast and revolutionary changes in our political and social structure, the ending of vested interests in land and industry, as well as the feudal and autocratic Indian States system. That means the ending of private property, except in a restricted sense, and the replacement of the present profit system by a higher ideal of co-operative service. It means ultimately a change in our instincts and habits and desires. In short, it means a new civilisation, radically different from the present capitalist order. Some glimpse we can have of this new civilisation in the territories of the U.S.S.R. Much has happened there which has pained me greatly and with which I disagree, but I look upon that great and fascinating unfolding of a new order and a new civilization as the most promising feature of our dismal age. If the future is full of hope it is largely because of Soviet Russia and what it has done, and I am convinced that, if some world catastrophe does not intervene, this new civilisation will spread to other lands and put an end to the wars and conflicts which capitalism

feeds... Socialism is thus for me not merely an economic doctrine which I favour; it is a vital creed which I hold with all my head and heart..."{URL28}

NEHRU'S JUVENILE FASCINATION WITH THE SOVIET MODEL THAT SEVERELY HARMED INDIA *Russia is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.* —Winston Churchill

### *If the future is full of hope it is largely because of Soviet Russia.* —Nehru

Despite the stark reality about the Soviet Union that was amply and effectively exposed through various channels, and were widely known during Nehru's time, he persisted with promoting, defending, and rationalising the Soviet system, and selling it to all, particularly to his own compatriots, as amply obvious through his pronouncements, speeches, and books.

Nehru and his colleague and protégé, Krishna Menon, regarded Harold Laski as their guru; and "Harold Laski of the British Labour Party spent a life-time apologising for and explaining away the crimes of the Soviet Union in terms of this or that 'compulsion of events' or 'historical necessity'."{SRG2/63} Even when Stalin's own compatriots sighed relief at his passing away on 6 March 1953, and Khrushchev later severely denounced him at the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party; surprisingly (or, was it no surprise!) Nehru, if one goes by his tribute to Stalin in the Indian Parliament, seemingly felt orphaned!

Apparently, apart from a plethora of monstrous atrocities, Nehru had "never heard of those more than a million orphaned children who wandered all over Soviet Russia after Stalin's forced collectivization had either killed off their parents or sent them to forced labour camps. Quite a large number of these children were later on physically destroyed by Stalin's orders because they were 'spreading disease'. Nor did he [Nehru] ever learn about those 'child heroes' who were acclaimed in the Soviet press and by the Soviet Government because they betrayed their parents to the Soviet secret police."{SRG2/57}

Wrote Sita Ram Goel on Nehru's pre-independence stands:

"But the Congress had promoted an incurable Soviet-addict [Nehru] to positions of power in its highest organs, and had permitted him to become its sole spokesman on foreign policy as well as its second best mass leader. The Congress had to pay the price. It had to remain in a state of paralysis from September 1939 to August 1942. The only action taken by the Congress during this period was the resignation of its Provincial Ministries under direction from another resolution drafted by Pandit Nehru and passed by the Congress Working Committee in October 1939. All its other attempts at political action, whether it was an attempt at cooperation with the British Government under the lead given by Rajaji in early 1940 or an attempt at direct action through individual civil disobedience, were half-hearted hazards devoid of all sense of selfconfidence."{SRG2/153}

"And the Congress frittered away its moral reputation as an organisation of fighters for human freedom when it refused to say even a single word of protest against the Stalin-Hitler Pact [1939], against the invasion of Poland and Finland by the Soviet Red Army, and against the incorporation of half of Poland and three independent Baltic States— Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia—in the Soviet Slave Empire."{SRG2/153-54}

"What was really fantastic in the whole situation was this Don Quixote of the Soviet Union [Nehru]. All through his life he had learnt nothing except going to jail properly garlanded and coming out of jail properly garlanded. But he had the cheek to ask a disarmed and downtrodden nation [Indians] to fight in defence of a cause [Soviet Union] which now sounded criminal to most of his countrymen. No one in the Soviet Union or her vast Comintern network had said a word in support of the case for India's independence."{SRG2/161}

"It was not an accident that in the volumes of the communist war-time weekly, People's War, there was not a word of criticism against Pandit Nehru while Mahatma Gandhi and other Congress leaders were wildly abused. The weekly cartooned Subhas Bose as a donkey and a dog and a rat and a rogue in fascist employ. The Communist Party of India denounced the Congress Socialists and Forward Blocists as agents of German-Japanese imperialism and regularly informed the British police about their activities. But all through this period [1940 onwards] Pandit Nehru and Maulana Azad were selected by the communists for fulsome praise."{SRG2/167}

USSR'S INDIFFERENT TREATMENT TO THE INDIAN AMBASSADOR Even a shabby treatment by Stalin of the Indian ambassador to the USSR did not shake Nehru's faith in the Soviet system.

Rather than hailing India on and after independence the communist journals from Moscow accused the Indian National Congress (INC) of selling India to 'Anglo-American imperialism'.{SRG2/82} Moscow was refusing to accept India as a genuinely independent country. Even though India's first ambassador to USSR Ms Vijayalakshmi Pandit (nepotism was built into Nehruvian genes) was Nehru's sister Kremlin coldshouldered her. Despite repeated requests, Stalin refused to give her appointment; and upon completion of her tenure, she returned to India without ever meeting Stalin. Even on petty matters, Moscow acted mean and hostile. It refused to supply furniture to the new Indian Embassy, which then was left with no alternative but to import it at a heavy cost from Stockholm! Yet, when questions were raised on the above matter in India, Nehru chose to pooh-pooh the matter, and tried to rationalise and cover up. {SRG2/82}

Nehru tried to suck-up to the country (USSR) that shunned, criticised, ignored and insulted you in the 1940s and early 1950s (things changed with Khrushchev); and cold-shouldered countries like the USA and Israel, which tried to be friendly. Such a person considered himself to be a great "internationalist" and "a foreign-affairs expert"; and what is more the great, wise Mahatma (Gandhi), and many other Congress stalwarts (except for the genuinely wise Sardar Patel) also thought so.

### NEHRU'S BOOKS BRING OUT HIS MARXIST-SOVIET ADDICTION

Nehru wrote a total of five main books; and they all had the Marxist World View as the dominant theme, coupled with his incurable addiction to the Soviet system. He apparently didn't "waste" time studying vital subjects like finance and economics, or the competing (and far more successful and proven) economic and political systems. Once a Marxist-addict, one could be dismissive of all other aspects, even if the stark facts belie your views that was a special kind of "scientific" thinking. Highlighted below are those glaring extracts from Nehru's books that bring out this Nehruvian-Marxist thinking, that had an adverse effect on his policies, and severely harmed India.

### Nehru's Book-1:

'Soviet Russia: Some Random Sketches and Impressions'

This was compiled in 1929 from a series of articles written by Nehru after his return in November 1927 from Moscow. Nehru went gaga about 'the Soviet Experiment', and wrote eulogistically about it—all on the basis of the official Soviet handouts showered on him, and his carefully-managed conducted-tour limited only to Moscow, and that too for just three-four days! Did it behove a "scientifically-minded" person to go so ecstatic without checking objective facts, and ignoring spate of negative and shocking information freely available from other sources?

Wrote Dr NS Rajaram: "Curiously, Nehru's admiration extended even to the Lubyanka—the notorious Moscow prison. Nehru wrote: 'It can be said without a shadow of a doubt, that to be in a Russian prison is far more preferable than [sic] to be a worker in an Indian factory. The mere fact that there are prisons like the ones we saw is in itself something for the Soviet Government to be proud of.' For a man who could admire Soviet prisons, it was not hard to admire and adopt the Soviet system of planning."{W.n7}

Contrast the above with what Bertrand Russel had to say after his visit to Russia:

"…the time I spent in Russia was one of continually increasing nightmare. I have said in print what, on reflection, appeared to me to be the truth, but I have not expressed the sense of utter horror which overwhelmed me while I was there. Cruelty, poverty, suspicion, prosecution formed the very air we breathed. Our conversations were continually spied upon… There was a hypocritical pretence of equality… I felt that everything that I valued in human life was being destroyed in the interest of a glib and narrow philosophy, and that in the process untold misery was being inflicted upon many millions of people…"{BNS/191-2}

Nehru's Book-2: 'Glimpses of World History'

Nehru wrote 'Glimpses of World History' in Naini jail between 1930 and 1933. It was published in 1934. This is how Sita Ram Goel commented on the book:

"When Pandit Nehru rose to unrivalled power and position in India his toadies recommended this book [Glimpses of World History] as a reliable reference work for advanced students of history in our universities. As

this book has been reprinted many times, translated into several languages of India, and poisoned successive generations of Indian intelligentsia, the ideas it lays down about Communism and Soviet Russia are of particular interest and deserve to be presented in some detail. In this book, he dismisses non-Marxist schools of Socialism in a single chapter while he devotes two chapters to Marx and Marxism…"{SRG2/44}

"The only explanation for Pandit Nehru's nonsensical admiration of Soviet Russia is that his mind was rendered imbecile because he refused to read anything which was not straight-forward communist propaganda. Had he cared even to glance at an array of highly objective and analytic studies of the Soviet Union such as had appeared in the West and were available in India several years before he compiled his Glimpses [of World History] by copiously copying from communist handouts, he would not have remained such a juvenile regarding the Soviet Union as he is even today, in the middle of 1961. But, perhaps, Pandit Nehru who had been denied fairy tales in his childhood because Motilalji wanted him to be educated on the most modern pattern from the West, was in search of a fairyland. Communist propaganda informed him that such a fairyland existed in Soviet Russia. And he closed his eyes and went into a trance from which he has never descended, notwithstanding his sycophants' recurring reassurance that he has been 'maturing of late'. To the majority of his intelligent countrymen, his 'mature mind' is revealed in his writings about Soviet Russia, particularly in the 'Glimpses of World History' which he has not had the decency to disclaim even after reading Khrushchev's verdict on Stalin's Russia about which he has been most enthusiastic."{SRG2/55}

### Nehru's Book-3: 'An Autobiography'

Nehru wrote 'An Autobiography' during 1934-35 in Bareilly and Dehra Dun jails. It was published in 1936. In the book, Nehru persisted with his fascination with Marxism-Communism. Wrote Nehru:

"The Bolsheviks may blunder or even fail because of national or international reasons and yet the communist theory may be correct... Russia apart, the theory and philosophy of Marxism lightened up many a dark corner of my mind. History came to have a new meaning for me. The Marxist interpretation threw a flood of light on it, and it became an unfolding drama with some order and purpose, howsoever unconscious,

behind it. In spite of the appalling waste and misery of the past and the present, the future was bright with hope, though many dangers intervened. It was the essential freedom from dogma and the scientific[???] outlook of Marxism that appealed to me. "{JN2}{SRG2/66}

# Nehru's Book-4: 'Unity of India'

This book is a collection of articles and speeches of Nehru during 1935- 40, and was published in 1941. Ignoring plethora of evidence exposing the Soviet Union, and what it did to Poland, Nehru continued to defend it. Wrote Nehru:

"Whatever doubts I had about internal happenings in Russia, I was quite clear in my mind about her foreign policy. This had been consistently one of peace and, unlike England and France, of fulfilling international obligations and supporting the cause of democracy abroad. The Soviet Union stood as the one real effective bulwark against Fascism in Europe and Asia. Without the Soviet Union what could be the state of Europe today? Fascist reaction would triumph everywhere and democracy and freedom would become dreams of a past age."{SRG2/73}

### Nehru's Book-5: 'Discovery of India'

Nehru wrote 'Discovery of India' between 1942 and 1945 in Ahmednagar Fort Jail. It was published in 1946. Wrote Nehru in its first chapter:

"A study of Marx and Lenin produced a powerful effect on my mind and helped me to see history and current affairs in a new light. The long chain of history and of social development appeared to have some meaning, some sequence and the future lost some of its obscurity. The practical achievements of the Soviet Union were also tremendously impressive. Often I disliked or did not understand some development there and it seemed to me to be too closely concerned with the opportunism of the moment or the power politics of the day. But despite all these developments and possible distortions of the original passion for human betterment, I had no doubt that the Soviet Revolution had advanced human society by a great leap and had lit a bright flame which could not be smothered, and that it had laid the foundation for the 'new civilisation' towards which the world would advance."{JN}{SRG2/76,77}

Given Nehru's consistent eulogising of Marxism, and praise and defence of the Soviet Union through his books, it was little wonder that Soviet Union not only translated his books into Russian (after Nikita Khrushchev took over as the president of the USSR), but paid him handsome royalties at 15% (something it didn't do for other authors and books).{W.n8} 'The Pioneer' states: "Subramanian Swamy, senior BJP leader, is of the view that it was improper on the part of Nehru to sell the rights to translate his works to the Soviet Union while he was the Prime Minister of the country. 'I have knowledge of enormous amount of money getting transferred to the Nehru family's account in Bank of China's Kolkata branch. An impropriety has been committed,' Swamy told 'The Pioneer'."{W.n8}

### FACILITATING MARXIST-COMMUNIST ENTRENCHMENT

Nehru remained sympathetic with and supportive of the Marxists-Communists and the Communist Party of India, as did his dynasty, despite the following stark facts:

They [communists] extended their swearology to the Indian National Congress, calling it as a conspiracy of India's capitalists and landlords in league with world imperialism.{SRG2/xii}

They had joined hands with the Raj in 1942, and spied on the patriots, receiving in return the British patronage.{SRG2/xii}

They had supported the demand for Pakistan during 1942-47, and helped the Muslim League fortify their case with a formidable array of arguments and statistics. They also advocated the balkanization of India into a score of sovereign states.{SRG2/xii}

They had denounced Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa as a homosexual pervert, Swami Vivekananda as a Hindu imperialist, Sri Aurobindo as a dirty war-monger, Rabindranath Tagore as a pimp, and stalwarts of the freedom movement such as Sardar Patel as the progeny of pigs and bastards of Birla and Tata.{SRG2/xiii}

They had come out openly in support of China when it occupied Tibet in 1950, and later drove out the Dalai Lama along with thousands of his followers in 1959.{SRG2/xiii}

The extent to which Nehru could not entrench the Marxist-Communists-Leftist mafia (especially owing to the 1962 India-China war), his daughter more than compensated—she had no ideology except for unbridled power for herself and her dynasty, and the mafia was helpful in that regard:

communists had even supported the Emergency! Under her, the "progressive" flock, that included sycophants, time-servers, and Moscow's hatchet men, multiplied fast and spread their tentacles in politics, academia, and media.{SRG2/ix-xii}

### NEHRUVIANISM & NEHRU'S 'IDEA OF INDIA'

A lot is commented on Nehru's so-called 'Idea of India' when actually it was nothing but an immature fascination with the Soviet Marxist-Communist system (which laid the foundations of India's poverty and misery) as something scientific, rational, modern and historically predestined; coupled with his fake "secularism", which had more to do with his disdain for India's ancient heritage [that actually gave it a national identity], and served his cause of vote-bank politics.

The claim that Nehru's secularism prevented India from becoming a theocratic Hindu state is totally bogus, because India has been practically secular and highly respectful of other religions for thousands of years, thanks to the tolerant Hindu world-view which, unlike the latter two Abrahamic religions, does not abuse other religions. Secularism was a pressing requirement in the West where the Church had been interfering in the affairs of the State. Such had never been the case in India.

A fair and proper idea of "Nehru's Idea of India" can be had by going through his blunders detailed under the chapters "Economy", "Educational & Cultural Mismanagement", and "Dynacracy & Dictatorial Tendencies" above. Observed Sitaram Goel on 'Nehruism':

"Today, I view Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru as a bloated Brown Sahib, and Nehruism as the combined embodiment of all the imperialist ideologies, Islam, Christianity, White Man's Burden, and Communism that have flooded this country in the wake of foreign invasions. *And I do not have the least doubt in my mind that if India is to live, Nehruism must die.* Of course, it is already dying under the weight of its sins against the Indian people, their country, their society, their economy, their environment, and their culture. *What I plead is that a conscious rejection of Nehruism in all its forms will hasten its demise, and save us from the mischief* which it is bound to create further if it is allowed to linger."{SRG/56}

"It may be remembered that Pandit Nehru was by no means a unique character. Nor is Nehruism a unique phenomenon for that matter. *Such weak-minded persons and such subservient thought processes have been seen in all societies that have suffered the misfortune of being conquered and subjected to alien rule for some time* . There are always people in all societies who confuse superiority of armed might with superiority of culture, who start despising themselves as belonging to an inferior breed and end by taking to the ways of the conqueror in order to regain selfconfidence, who begin finding faults with everything they have inherited from their forefathers, and who finally join hands with every force and factor which is out to subvert their ancestral society. Viewed in this perspective, *Pandit Nehru was no more than a self-alienated Hindu, and Nehruism is not much more than Hindu-baiting born out of and sustained by a deep-seated sense of inferiority vis a vis Islam, Christianity, and the modern West* ."{SRG/59}

Proof of pudding is in the eating; and so what did the Nehru's "Idea of India" and its implementation during his over-long 17 years of rule delivered for India?— a toxic political (dynastic and undemocratic), economic (socialistic, and poverty-perpetuating), industrial (inefficient and burdensome public and state sector), agricultural (neglected and starved, making India a pathetically poor and hungry nation, and an international beggar), geographic and external security (most borders insecure, and a weak nation unable to defend itself), administrative (incompetent and corrupt babudom), historical (Marxist, Leftist and Negationist distortions), educational (elitist, and no universal literacy), and cultural (no pride in Indian heritage) legacy.
