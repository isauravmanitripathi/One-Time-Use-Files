# *Blunder–48 :* NEHRU–LIAQUAT PACT 1950

With indescribable atrocities against Hindus in East Bengal going unabated, the GoI made an appeal to Pakistan to call a halt on the same. But, there was little response, till tit-for-tat brought Pakistan to the negotiating table.

It is worth noting in this connection that Gandhian non-violent principles yielded nothing, as this episode illustrates. In Rajlakshmi Debi's Bangla novel Kamal-lata, quoted by Tathagata Roy in his book 'My People, Uprooted: A Saga of the Hindus of Eastern Bengal'{TR} (Chapter 6), there is a conversation described between a Hindu from Mymensingh town and a Muslim from a Calcutta suburb sometime just after partition. In the process of haggling the Muslim says, "Excuse me, but your position and ours are not the same. So long as Mahatma Gandhi is alive we have no fears. But you won't be able to live here [East Bengal] much longer."

There was a marked difference between Punjab and Bengal in respect of the partition. In Punjab, the carnage was on both sides, East Punjab and West Punjab, although more in the Muslim-dominated West Punjab. In Bengal, the mayhem was mostly in the Muslim-dominated East Bengal. In Punjab, the migration was both ways. In a way, there was a population transfer between West Punjab and East Punjab. In Bengal, the predominant migration was that of Hindus from East Pakistan to West Bengal. There was a reverse migration of Muslims too, but comparatively far less.

However, the continued violence against the Hindus in East Bengal had begun provoking retaliation in West Bengal. For example, the anti-Muslim riots in Howrah turned serious from 26 March 1950 onwards, leading to the beginning of migration of Muslims from West Bengal to East Bengal by March 1950. That is, the population transfer that had happened in Punjab in 1947-48 began to happen in Bengal belatedly by March 1950. It is this which alarmed Pakistan and the Muslim League leaders, who had hitherto been inciting the mobs in East Bengal, and were happy at Hindus being at the receiving end.

It was only when the anti-Muslim riots in Howrah, in retaliation of the on-going carnage in East Bengal, took a serious turn from 26 March 1950 onwards that the Pakistan PM Liaquat Ali made his first conciliatory gesture in a speech at Karachi on 29 March 1950, and expressed his intention to travel to New Delhi on 2 April 1950 to work out a solution with Nehru. Liaquat Ali hurried to New Delhi on 2 April 1950, and signed the Nehru–Liaquat Pact, also called the Delhi Pact, on 8 April 1950. It provided for safety of refugees when they returned to dispose of their property; return of abducted women and looted property; derecognition of forced conversions; complete and equal right of citizenship and security of life and properties to minorities; and setting up of Minority Commission in each country.

As expected, while India firmly implemented the Pact, not Pakistan. While the anti-Muslim violence in West Bengal was put down with a firm hand, and the migration of Muslims from West Bengal to East Bengal ceased; the violence against the Hindus in East Bengal continued unabated, so also the migration of Hindus from East Bengal to West Bengal. That is, the carnage became only one-sided: that of Hindus in East Bengal. Also, the migration became only one way: Pakistan to India.

Looking to the track-record of the Muslim League leaders, who had themselves been inciting the mobs, Nehru should have known what the result of the pact would be. Sardar Patel was unhappy with the Pact, but being in the cabinet, didn't oppose it. However, Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and KC Niyogee, the two central ministers from West Bengal, immediately resigned from the Union Cabinet in protest against the Pact.

Rather than facilitating transfer of population between West and East Bengal, and removing forever the problem and the poison, Nehru extracted the following "benefits" for India from the Nehru-Liaquat pact: (1)Checked depletion of Muslim population from West Bengal and Assam by stopping their migration to Pakistan. (2)Increased the population of Muslims in West Bengal and Assam by allowing their reverse migration—allowing Muslims, who had migrated, to return. (3)Allowed fresh migration of Muslims from East Bengal. (5)Condemned the Hindus in East Bengal (a)to violence, (b)to second-class status, and (c)to remain at the mercy of Muslims. (6)Forced subsequent migration of Hindus from East Bengal to West Bengal (as the atrocities did not subside in Pakistan).

#### LETTING GO OF GWADAR

Gwadar is a port-city on the Arabian Sea on the south-western coast of Baluchistan province in Pakistan. It is located opposite Oman across the sea, near the border with Iran, and to the east of the Persian Gulf. Gwadar is a warm-water, deep-sea port, and it has a strategic location between South Asia, Central Asia and West Asia at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, just outside the Straits of Hormuz. The operations of Gwadar's strategic sea port were handed over by Pakistan to China in 2013. Now, thanks to the Chinese money and expertise, Gwadar is all set to emerge as Pakistan's third largest port. Gwadar will be the southern point and the sea terminal of the \$46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that will extend to Kashgar in Xinjiang. The CPEC is part of China's "One Belt, One Road" (OBOR).

Gwadar was not owned by the British at the time of independence. Gwadar was an overseas possession of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman —it was given as a gift to Oman by the Khan of Kalat in 1783—until Pakistan purchased the territory on 8 September 1958. Pakistan assumed its control on 8 December 1958, and the territory was later integrated into Baluchistan province on 1 July 1970 as Gwadar District.

Oman was on good terms with India, and Sultan of Oman had offered to sell Gwadar to India for mere one million US dollars. However, India under Nehru did not take the offer, and let go of such an excellent strategic location. It was ultimately purchased by Pakistan on 8 September 1958 for three million US dollars.

It had the great potential of a deep water port (which China is now exploiting), but Nehru didn't have the foresight to appreciate its critical benefit. Even if Nehru didn't see much use of the place then as a deep water port, India should have acquired it, so that it could have been used as a bargaining chip with Pakistan, vis-à-vis Kashmir and other matters.

In hindsight, not accepting the priceless gift from the Sultan of Oman was a huge mistake at par with the long list of post-independence strategic blunders by Nehru.

INDUS WATER TREATY—HIMALAYAN BLUNDER

Nehru's *First* Himalayan Blunder: Tibet's Erasure as a Nation:Blunder#33- 4

Nehru's *Second* Himalayan Blunder: Indus Water Treaty (IWT): Blunder#50

Nehru's *Third* Himalayan Blunder: India-China War : Blunder#35-6

~~~ "*No armies with bombs and shellfire could devastate a land so thoroughly as Pakistan could be devastated by the simple expedient of India's permanently shutting off the source of waters that keep the fields and people of Pakistan green* ."

—David Lilienthal, former Chief, Tennessee Valley Authority, US {Swa6}

"*The 'Aqua Bomb' is truly India's most powerful weapon against Pakistan. As the upper riparian state, India can control the flow of the seven rivers that flow into the Indus Basin* ."{Swa6}

In the India-Pakistan Indus Water Treaty (IWT) of 1960 on sharing of waters from the six Indus-system rivers, Nehru gave away far, far more than what was adequate, miserably failing to envisage India's future needs; and did not even leverage it to have the J&K dispute settled. As the upper riparian state, India could have called the shots, but Nehru, by unwisely agreeing to the World Bank (manipulated by the US and the West) mediation, surrendered all its advantages.{Swa6} India-Pakistan Indus Water Treaty of 1960 has parallel with India-China Panchsheel agreement of 1954. Both had generous "give away" but no reciprocal "take" and both were thanks to Nehru!

Wrote Brahma Chellaney:{URL48}

"Jawaharlal Nehru ignored the interests of Jammu and Kashmir and, to a lesser extent, Punjab when he signed the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, under which India bigheartedly agreed to the exclusive reservation of the largest three of the six Indus-system rivers for downstream Pakistan… In effect, India signed an extraordinary treaty indefinitely setting aside 80.52% of the Indus-system waters for Pakistan—the most generous water-sharing pact thus far in modern world history.

"In fact, the volume of waters earmarked for Pakistan from India under the Indus treaty is more than 90 times greater than what the US is required to release for Mexico under the 1944 US-Mexico Water Treaty, which stipulates a minimum transboundary delivery of 1.85 billion cubic metres of the Colorado River waters yearly.

"Despite Clinton's advocacy of a Teesta treaty, the fact is that the waters of the once-mighty Colorado River are siphoned by seven American states, leaving only a trickle for Mexico.

"India and Nehru did not envisage—you may call it a lack of foresight on their part—that water resources would come under serious strain due to developmental and population pressures. Today, as the bulk of the Indus system's waters continue to flow to an adversarial Pakistan waging a war by terror, India's own Indus basin, according to the 2030 Water Resources Group, is reeling under a massive 52% deficit between water supply and demand...

"Worse still, the Indus treaty has deprived Jammu and Kashmir of the only resource it has—water. The state's three main rivers—the Chenab, the Jhelum (which boast the largest crossborder discharge of all the six Indus-system rivers) and the main Indus stream—have been reserved for Pakistan's use, thereby promoting alienation and resentment in the Indian state.

"This led the Jammu and Kashmir state legislature to pass a bipartisan resolution in 2002 calling for a review and annulment of the Indus treaty. To help allay popular resentment in the state over the major electricity shortages that is hampering its development, the central government subsequently embarked on hydropower projects like Baglihar and Kishenganga. But Pakistan—as if to perpetuate the alienation in the Indian state—took the Baglihar project to a World Bank-appointed international neutral expert and Kishenganga to the International Court of Arbitration, which last year stayed all further work on the project..."{URL48}

Perplexing thing is that Nehru could settle an international water issue like Indus Water Treaty, for it involved only a generous give-away on the part of India; but he failed to tackle India's own internal river-water disputes like those relating to the sharing of Narmada water, or the Krishna-Kaveri dispute.

#### NO INITIATIVE ON SRI LANKAN TAMIL PROBLEM

It is sad that even though the two peoples—the Sinhalese and the Tamils —spring from the same civilisational background, they have been at loggerheads. People from Gujarat and Sindh (some say Odisha) in India immigrated to Sri Lanka and formed the Sinhala dynasty. Chronicles— Mahavansa and Dipavansa—record the landing of Wijaya in the sixth century BC.

Sadly, the Sri Lankan Tamil problem was allowed to fester and Nehru did little to get the matter resolved in the fifties, when it could have been—and it grew worse.

Both the 'Sri Lankan Citizenship Act of 1948' and the 'Official Language Act of 1956' put the Tamils at a severe disadvantage. Sri Lanka witnessed mayhem of Tamils in 1958, amounting almost to genocide. Tamils everywhere were attacked mercilessly, and their properties were burnt or looted. Sinhala mobs poured kerosene over many Tamils, and burnt them alive. Thousands were injured or killed. Many were internally displaced. It was a case of state-sponsored terror.

Walter Crocker, who was then the Australian ambassador to India, says in his book, 'Nehru: A Contemporary's Estimate'{Croc} , that while India and Nehru spoke against the treatment of Africans in the European colonies, and justifiably so; in contrast, with regard to the ill treatment of Tamils in Ceylon, they did precious little. Writes Crocker: "...and with little done to save Indians in Ceylon from treatment which was worse than the treatment meted out to Africans in European colonies in Africa."

But, that was typical of Nehru. He railed against the discrimination and savagery in distant lands—against blacks in South Africa—but remained conspicuously silent about our own people next door: against the Hindus in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), or against the Tamils in Sri Lanka. Because, the former required only talking; while the latter required action too!

If India had succeeded in doing the needful in the fifties, much of the trouble that Sri Lanka and the Tamils and the Sinhalese faced subsequently could have been avoided. It is in such cases that the statesmanship of a leader is tested.

### ERRONEOUS NEHRU-ERA MAP

An error in the Indian maps shows territory as large as Sikkim or Goa in Arunachal Pradesh as belonging to China. The error has yet to be corrected.

Extracts below from an article{URL29} by Madhav Nalapat in 'The Sunday Guardian' of 23 August 2014 are self-explanatory:

"Prime Minister Manmohan Singh rejected an August 2013 request by senior officials in his government to correct a serious error, dating back over 50 years, in India's official maps. In effect, this oversight in official maps mistakenly gave China control of two Arunachal Pradesh "fishtails", a territory as large as Sikkim or Goa, and continuously inhabited by Indian citizens...

"…The two 'fishtail' formations in Arunachal Pradesh were omitted from maps prepared by the Survey of India during the 1960s, although the area has always been under the control of India. No public records exist as to why and how such a significant error was made. In 1962, recognising the fact that this territory was Indian, soldiers from the People's Liberation Army of China, who had occupied the fishtails during November 1962, withdrew after the unilateral ceasefire declared by Beijing that month.

"'Since then and before, the area within the two fishtails has always been occupied by our troops, as well as by the Mishmi tribe, all of whom are citizens of India. Our claim on the territory is incontestable and our maps ought to have been updated to reflect this,' a senior official stated.

"…Asked as to why official maps did not reflect the fact of the 'fishtails' being Indian territory, the reply was that 'as the mistake took place during Nehru's time, it was felt that correcting the maps formally would draw attention to this mistake on the part of the then Prime Minister and thereby tarnish his name'.

"A retired official claimed that 'every government has protected Nehru's reputation by refusing to make public facts dating from the 1940s that they saw as damaging to the image of Nehru'. He and a former colleague saw Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's 2013 refusal to formally change the map (a decision taken 'after consultations with the political authority') as part of the effort to protect the reputation of Jawaharlal

Nehru by refusing to make public any details of his failures, including the decision to keep secret the Henderson-Brooks Report on the 1962 war, or to draw attention to Nehru's failures even by the necessary step of rectifying them.

"Interestingly, the fact that maps showed the two 'fishtails' as being outside Indian territory was, according to a senior (and now retired) official, 'brought to the attention of then Home Minister P. Chidambaram by the (then) Director-General of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) in 2010, along with reports of Chinese troops entering the area in 2011 and 2012, but the response was to do nothing'..."{URL29}

#### ADVOCATING CHINA'S UNSC MEMBERSHIP AT OUR COST

India has been trying to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for a long time, begging all nations—big and small—including China. But, over five decades ago India was getting the UNSC seat unasked—on a platter! And, Nehru chose to rebuff the offer!! Why? Nehru wanted the position to be given to the People's Republic of China instead! Being generous at India's cost!! But, note the contrast. In 2008, in a conclave of foreign ministers of BRIC countries, when Russia proposed that the BRIC countries support India's Permanent Membership of the UNSC, it was strongly opposed by China!

First, the background. On account of the failure of the League of Nations to prevent World War II, United Nations Organisation (UNO) was formed in 1945 after World War II by the main allies in the War: US, UK, USSR, France and China—ROC (Republic of China) headed by Chiang Kai-shek. These five became the Permanent Members of the UNSC, with veto powers. UNSC also has 10 rotating non-permanent members with a term of two years.

In 1949, Communists took over China and founded People's Republic of China (PRC ) under Mao. Chiang Kai-shek and his ROC were driven away to Formosa—now called Taiwan. ROC continued to be a member of the UN till 1971, and not PRC, as US and allies refused to recognise it. They did not wish to have another communist country as a member of the UNSC.

The move by the US to have India in the UNSC in lieu of China started in 1950. In that context, in response to the letter of his sister Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, who was then the ambassador in the US, Nehru wrote:

"In your letter you mention that the State Department is trying to unseat China as a Permanent Member of the Security Council and to put India in her place. So far as we are concerned, we are not going to countenance it. That would be bad from every point of view. It would be a clear affront to China and it would mean some kind of a break between us and China. I suppose the state department would not like that, but we have no intention of following that course. We shall go on pressing for China's admission in the UN and the Security Council. I suppose that a crisis will come during the next sessions of the General Assembly of the UN on this issue. The people's government of China is sending a full delegation there. If they fail to get in there will be trouble which might even result in the USSR and some other countries finally quitting the UN. That may please the State Department, but it would mean the end of the UN as we have known it. That would also mean a further drift towards war. India because of many factors, is certainly entitled to a permanent seat in the security council. But we are not going in at the cost of China."{URL37}

Was India under Nehru trying to take a high moral ground? But, why? Why not look to your own country's interest? Besides, was Nehru's stand even ethical, moral, and principled? No. Why support an aggressor of Tibet for the UN and the UNSC? Correct ethical and moral position for India should have dictated trenchant opposition of China for the UN and the UNSC as long as it did not vacate Tibet.

What was bizarre was that even though never requested by China, India had been voluntarily and vigorously advocating Peoples Republic of China (PRC) for the Permanent Membership of the UNSC in lieu of Taiwan! India lobbied with all nations for the UN membership and UNSC permanent seat, not for itself, but for China!

Even though China had invaded Tibet, KM Panikkar, the Indian Ambassador in Beijing, stated that to protest the Chinese invasion of Tibet would be an interference to India's efforts on behalf of China in the UN! That is, complaining against China on behalf of Tibet would show China in bad light—as an aggressor—when it was more important for India to ensure China's entry into the UN, for which India had been trying, and ensure that this effort of India was not thwarted by taking up China's Tibet aggression!

What kind of crazy Nehruvian foreign policy was this? Our own national security interests and the interests of Tibet were sought to be sacrificed to help China enter the UN!!

Incidentally, there was another irony to India advocating the UN membership of China in the fifties. As per 'Mao: The Unknown Story' by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday{JC} , and other books, India thought it was doing a great favour to China by advocating its membership of the UN, and expecting it to feel obliged; however, China resented such overtures, for it abhorred the patronizing attitude of Nehru—more so because China considered itself to be the real leader of Asia, and contemptuously looked at India's pretensions to being a great power merely on rhetoric, with nothing to show for it. Further, China did not really care then—in the fifties—of the UN membership. In fact, it thought that becoming a member would oblige it to abide by the UN charter, when it wanted to actually have a free hand in dealing with Korea and Tibet.

Both the US and the USSR were willing to accommodate India as a Permanent Member of the UNSC (United Nations Security Council) in 1955, in lieu of Taiwan, or in addition to it as a sixth member, after amending the UN charter. This Nehru refused! Wrote Nehru in his note of 1 August 1955 on his tour of the Soviet Union and other countries during June-July 1955:

"Informally, suggestions have been made by the United States that China should be taken into the United Nations but not in the Security Council and that India should take her place in the Security Council. We cannot of course accept this as it means falling out with China and it would be very unfair for a great country like China not to be in the Security Council. We have, therefore, made it clear to those who suggested this that we cannot agree to this suggestion. We have even gone a little further and said that India is not anxious to enter the Security Council at this stage, even though as a great country she ought to be there. The first step to be taken is for China to take her rightful place and then the question of India might be considered separately."{JNSW/Vol-29/303}

It was almost as if Nehru, for reasons one cannot fathom, totally ignored India's own strategic interests! It is possible that the US and the USSR were more keen to show PRC its place, than to really promote India. But, so what —if it also served India's interests. India should have been alive to its own

self-interest. Why should Nehru have been generous to China at the cost of India! Shashi Tharoor states in 'Nehru: The Invention of India':

"Indian diplomats who have seen the files swear that at about the same time Jawaharlal also declined a US offer to take the permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council then held, with scant credibility, by Taiwan, urging that it be offered to Beijing instead... But it was one thing to fulminate against Great Power machinations, another to run a national foreign policy with little regard to the imperatives of power or the need of a country to bargain from a position of strength."{ST/183}

Reads a 'Business Line' article 'UN reforms—a fading mirage?' of 16 September 2009:{URL14}

"Ironically, around 1955, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was offered the disputed Chinese Permanent Security Council seat by the US to keep out the People's Republic of China, and he also was sounded out by the USSR Prime Minister, Nikolai Bulganin, to allow China to take this seat while giving India a sixth permanent seat in the Security Council. Nehru rejected this offer in deference to China. History may have been different if this offer had been subjected to serious negotiations. Through the decades since, we have been struggling for this seat."{URL14}

S Gopal wrote in his book 'Jawaharlal Nehru: A Biography' (vol-2): "He (Jawaharlal Nehru) rejected the Soviet offer to propose India as the sixth permanent member of the Security Council and insisted that priority be given to China's admission to the United Nations." {URL50}

When an MP JN Parekh raised a short notice question in the Lok Sabha on whether India had refused a UNSC seat informally offered to her, Nehru's reply was apparently less than honest: "There has been no offer, formal or informal, of this kind. Some vague references have appeared in the press about it which have no foundation in fact. The composition of the Security Council is prescribed by the UN Charter, according to which certain specified nations have permanent seats. No change or addition can be made to this without an amendment of the Charter. There is, therefore, no question of a seat being offered and India declining it. Our declared policy is to support the admission of all nations qualified for UN membership."{URL50}

A Wilson Centre report of 11 March 2015 titled 'Not at the Cost of China: India and the United Nations Security Council, 1950'{URL37} states

that both the US and the USSR offered India permanent membership in the UNSC but Nehru refused to accept it, and wanted it to be given to China instead.

Writes Arun Shourie in 'Are we deceiving ourselves again?':

"...The Communists seize power [in China]. Panditji [Nehru] is the first to ensure that India recognizes the new Government. He also urges countries like U.K. to hasten recognition. Although, it is Chiang Kai-shek who has supported India's struggle for independence...Panditji immediately begins championing the cause of the new Government [of China]. He urges the British, the Americans, in fact everyone he can reach, that the Nationalist Government [of Chiang Kai-shek] must be made to vacate its seat in the United Nations, and that seat—which means necessarily the seat both in the General Assembly and the Security Council—must be given over to the Communist Government..."{AS/28-9}

What was even more bizarre was that even after the 1962 India-China war, India supported China in the UN. Declared Nehru's sister Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, who was leading a delegation to the UN in 1963, that she "doesn't understand that why a world-class organization such as the United Nations has not included a big and powerful country like China."{URL38}

If you analyse India's actions and moves then, we appear to be novices and simpletons! Speaking to students of Lucknow University in November 1951, Ambedkar had said: "The government's foreign policy failed to make India stronger. Why should not India get a permanent seat in the UN Security Council? Why has the prime minister not tried for it?"

### *Blunder–54 :*

#### REBUFFING ISRAEL, THE FRIEND-IN-NEED

The irony and the absurdity of Nehru's foreign policy is hard not to notice: India under Nehru was amongst the first nations to recognise PRC (People's Republic of China) when Communists took over in 1949; but when it came to Israel, Nehru did not recognise it as a nation till September 1950, even though it was established on 14 May 1948, and most nations of the world had recognised it! While Nehru campaigned for admission of China to the UN and even into the UNSC, sacrificing its own chances (Blunder#53); India not only voted against the UN resolution that had the

effect of creating Israel, but also voted against Israel's admission in the UN in 1949! This when China did what it did—annexing Tibet and inflicting 1962 India-China war—while Israel was indeed India's friend-in-need!

On 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly voted on the modified UN Partition Plan of Palestine that effectively included creation of Israel for Jews. 33 nations voted in favour—they included the US, the European countries, the Soviet Union and the East-European countries, and the Latin-American countries—and 13 against. There were 10 abstentions and 1 absent. Abstentions included Republic of China and Yugoslavia.

Those against included 10 Muslim nations, namely Afghanistan, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey and Yemen, and 3 others, namely Cuba, Greece, and one more country. Guess which? Most regretfully, it was India. This was despite Albert Einstein's personal appeal to Nehru. Here are extracts from the article "When Nehru Shunned Einstein's Request To Support The Jewish Cause":{Swa5}

"On 11 June 1947, Albert Einstein made an extraordinary intervention in global geo-political affairs by writing to then prime minister-designate of India, Jawaharlal Nehru. He implored India's leader to endorse the 'Zionist effort to recreate a Jewish Homeland in Palestine'. Appealing to Nehru's moral sensibilities, he focused on the ethical question of whether the Jews should be allowed to have a homeland in the 'soil of their fathers'. In his letter, Einstein described the historical wrong done to the Jewish people, who had been 'victimized and hounded' for centuries. He wrote that millions of Jews had died not only because of the Nazi gas chambers but also because 'there was no spot on the globe where they could find sanctuary'. Zionism was the means to end this anomaly of history, he wrote, and a solution for this persecuted people to settle in a land to which they had 'historic ties'.{Swa5}

A nation which got independence only a few months earlier on 15 August 1947 after having suffered foreign domination, ignominy, insult to its culture and religion and back-breaking exploitation for over 1000 years should have valued independence or creation of another nation, especially those for Jews, who richly-deserved it. Jews had suffered for centuries like the Hindus had suffered, though much longer. We should have had empathy for them. But, Nehru? What can one say of his convoluted thinking,

defective world-view and faulty approach! India could have at least abstained from voting, rather than voting against.

Nehru could recognise China's sovereignty over Tibet, which had an adverse impact on India, but not build relations with Israel, with which India had much in common, and relations with whom would have been very helpful in various fields. Indira Gandhi, like her father, and Rajiv Gandhi, like her mother, maintained their distance from Israel. What Nehru-Indira Dynasty did was driven by their self-interest of vote-bank politics (Minority Muslim votes) at the cost of the nation. It was left to the wise non-Dynasty Prime Minister Narsimha Rao to establish formal relations with Israel in 1992.

It is worth noting that despite Nehru-Indira Dynasty's unjust treatment of Israel, Israel helped India in whatever manner it could in India's multiple wars with its neighbours. India sought and got arms from Israel both in the 1962 India-China war{Hin1} and in the 1971 Bangladesh war. Israel has been supplying us critical military and security equipments. Its modern and innovative agricultural practices are worth emulating by India. Despite severe lack of natural resources, wars, and enemies on all sides, the new nation of Israel created only in 1948 became a shining first-world nation within a few decades, while India under the Nehru dynasty remained a poor, miserable, third-rate, third-world country.

#### NEGLECTING SOUTHEAST ASIA

Nehru gave little importance to the relations with Southeast Asian countries, and was patronizing towards them, even though India had much to learn from them looking to their far better economic growth rate. Here is an example of Nehru's snobbishness. Even as India was going around the world with a begging bowl, Nehru didn't flinch from being sarcastic on Southeast Asian countries and their economy, which had actually been doing far better. Wrote Durga Das [*words in italics in square-brackets are author's* ]{DD/342} :

"A talk with the Prime Minister of Thailand was very revealing. He complained that Nehru had characterised the Thai Government as corrupt [*What about the financial scandals in the Nehru government?* ] and said the country had a 'Coca-Cola economy'… Thailand, the Prime Minister explained to me, had a long tradition of independence, and if she had taken shelter under the U.S. umbrella it had done so to safeguard her independence. If Nehru was willing to underwrite their security [*it's another matter India could not secure itself!* ], the Thais would prefer to be with India since Thai culture was predominantly Indian [*He didn't know that India under Nehru didn't care for its own culture!* ]… When I suggested that a visit by the King and the Prime Minister to India would improve matters, he replied that their very experienced Ambassador in New Delhi had warned them against inviting an insult by undertaking such a visit. They treated their ruler as a demi-god, and he would not go to India unless assured of a cordial welcome."{DD/342} .

India had even rebuffed the fast-growing Japan. Krishna Menon, the right-hand man of Nehru, had snubbed offers of the Japanese corporate representatives for collaboration saying it was out of question on account of the vast differences in the policies of the two countries.{DD/346}

Lee Kwan Yew took Singapore's per capita income from \$400 in 1959 to \$55,000. Yet in the Nehru-Indira era, Indian socialists viewed Lee with contempt as a neo-colonial puppet destined for humiliation and poverty. {URL64}

#### INDIA VS. THE US & THE WEST

India would have gained immensely had it aligned with the West, or had at least been pro-West, or bent a little towards them, especially the US and the UK. Had that been so perhaps there would have been no Kashmir issue, and neither China nor Pakistan would have dared to attack India. Besides, had we adopted the free-market capitalist economy of the West, we would have been in a far, far better shape, and perhaps by 1980 India would have been a first-world nation. Instead, Nehru, although he talked non-alignment, showed his bias towards the Communist bloc. That was because Nehru was basically a Marxist-socialist in outlook. Notably, during the 1962 IndiaChina war, while the communist or the non-aligned nations did not come to India's help, it was the US, of whom the Nehru&Co were very critical, that came to the rescue of India.

With the US, a country vitally important to the India's interests, Nehru's attitude was indifferent, as would be obvious from what follows. Wrote Arthur Schlesinger Jr, Special Assistant to President Kennedy and a distinguished historian, on Nehru's visit to the US in 1961 in his book: "His [Nehru's] strength was failing, and he retained control more by momentum of the past than by mastery of the present... Nehru listened without expression… In conversation he displayed interest and vivacity only with Jacqueline [Kennedy]… The private meetings between the President and the Prime Minister were no better. Nehru was terribly passive, and at times Kennedy was hard put to keep the conversation going... It was, the President said later, like trying to grab something in your hand, only to have it turn out to be just fog... The following spring, reminiscing about the meeting, Kennedy described it to me as 'a disaster; the worst Head of State visit I have had'… It was certainly a disappointment, and Kennedy's vision of India had been much larger before the visit than it would ever be again. Nehru was obviously on the decline; his country, the President now decided, would be increasingly preoccupied with its own problems and turn more and more into itself. Though Kennedy retained his belief in the necessity of helping India achieve its economic goals, he rather gave up hope, after seeing Nehru, that India would be in the next years a great affirmative force in the world or even in South Asia.{ASJ/524=6}

About Nehru's visit to the US in 1961, wrote Stanley Wolpert:

"The long flight had wearied Nehru, but he perked up as soon as he saw Jackie [Jacqueline Kennedy] and was most excited by the prospect of her imminent visit to India with her lovely sister, both of whom he invited to stay in his house, in the suite that Edwina had always occupied. But Kennedy found Nehru so unresponsive in their talks—which for the most part turned out to be Kennedy monologues—that he later rated his summit with Nehru as 'the worst State visit' he had ever experienced. Nehru's age and reluctance to 'open up' in Washington proved most frustrating to his young host, who also found infuriating Nehru's focus on his wife and his inability to keep his hands from touching her."{Wolp2/480}

This is what Kuldip Nayar wrote on the same visit: "Kennedy organised a breakfast meeting between Nehru and top US economists and foreign

policy experts. Nehru was late for the meeting and generally monosyllabic in his responses. The breakfast ended in 20 minutes. Some of them reported this to Kennedy who remarked in the presence of his aides that Nehru had 'lived too long'."{KN}

Apparently, Nehru's actions and behaviour were dictated more by his personal predilections, his arrogance, and his leftist, pro-USSR, procommunist bend, than by what was in the best interest of an emerging nation like India. Wrote MN Roy:

"For her economic development India requires foreign financial aid which can come only from the United States. The latter had repeatedly expressed readiness to extend the help as in the case of Europe. But Nehru's foreign policy has prevented India from receiving the help she requires. From this point of view his visit to the U.S.A. was an all-round failure. It yielded no concrete result, and pleased nobody except himself. He disappointed American statesmen by his refusal to take sides in cold war, and annoyed businessmen by the morbid suspicion of political strings attached to foreign capital… The all-round failure and disappointment were due to the Actor's [Nehru's] desire to draw applause from the world leftist gallery, and also to increase his popularity with the vocal middle class at home by pandering to their national conceit."{Roy/5-6}

The New York Times described Nehru as "one of the greatest disappointments of the post-war era".{Roy/7}

### 'NON-ALIGNED' WITH NATIONAL INTERESTS

Rather than having strong allies on its side to deter others, India, thanks to Nehru's self-defeating foreign policy of 'Non-Alignment', remained non-aligned so that Pakistan (aligned with the West) and China (aligned with the USSR) felt free to attack India, knowing it to be a non-risky business as no country would come to the rescue of a non-aligned India in its hours of distress. Common sense dictated that till you became strong enough to defend yourself, have sensible pacts with some strong nations to take care of your security.

Non-aligned policy fetched no gains for India.{Swa3} If India had aligned itself with the US and the West, not only would India have been much better off economically, neither China nor Pakistan would have dared to attack India, and the Kashmir issue would have been solved in India's favour long ago. By being apparently loosely aligned with the Soviets, India effectively chose to be on the losing side of the Cold War, with all its severe political and economic disadvantages and handicaps.

Pakistan was much smarter. After its creation, its first PM Liaquat Ali Khan accepted an invitation from Moscow—deliberately. The purpose was to alarm the opposite side in the cold war: the US and the UK. Expectedly, the US and the UK made a deal with Pakistan: in return for Pakistan joining the Anglo-American Military bloc, they would support Pakistan on Kashmir and other matters against India.

Wrote Walter Crocker: "As late as 1956, [John Foster] Dulles [the then US Secretary of State], who distrusted Nehru as much as Nehru distrusted him—as was not concealed when Dulles visited India in 1954—said that 'the conception of neutrality is obsolete, immoral, and short-sighted'. For Dulles, neutrality in all forms, including non-alignment, was a refusal to choose between evil and good; that is to say, between communism and anticommunism."{Croc/94}

All that non-alignment did was it helped project the image of Nehru on the world stage. It let him play as the 'Don Quixote of World Peace' in international fora. It helped grant Nehru rhetorical leadership in non-aligned forums, but it did precious little for India. In fact India grievously suffered from that stand. In short, Nehru's policy of 'Non-Alignment' was not aligned to the Indian national interests.

NON-ALIGNED WITH THE WEST, BUT ALIGNED WITH THE SOVIETS

Even the so-called 'Non-Alignment' was really not so; it was a subtle alignment with the Soviets: for details, please check the chapter "Nehru's World View" (Blunder#106-7) further down. Wrote Sita Ram Goel then:

"The Soviet Union, on the other hand, has enslaved vast areas and populations in East and West. The three Baltic States—Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania—have once again disappeared from the map and into the belly of the Russian Bear. Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Rumania and Albania are being ruled by Soviet satraps sustained by Soviet bayonets. Parts of Finland, Germany, Korea, Vietnam and Laos

are under Soviet armed occupation. Mongolia, China and Tibet have been overrun by traitorous gangs armed by the Soviet Union. And the totalitarian terror of Soviet imperialism that now prevails in all these lands has had no parallel in the whole of human history."{SRG2/173}

"Yet, there is not a single resolution of the Indian National Congress or a single statement by any Indian Government spokesman which … denounces the dirty deeds of the Soviet warlords. On the contrary, India has joined her voice to every tirade which the communist parties and fronts have launched against Western 'colonialism'. And India has patronised persistently and painstakingly the puppet regimes which the Soviet Union has set up in so many countries. It was only the other day that the Prime Minister of India declared in broad daylight that the East European Satellites of the Soviet Union were fully sovereign nations!"{SRG2/173}

"Similarly, India has been on the Soviet side in every single international tangle since the Second World War—Palestine, Korea, Tibet, Viet Nam, Hungary, Cuba, Berlin. And India has never failed to denounce whatever measures of self-defence the Western nations have adopted against the communist menace. All that has happened while the West has honestly tried to understand, appreciate, and accommodate our point of view, the Soviet camp has heaped foul abuse and slander upon us whenever we have strayed away from its stand even by a hair's breadth."{SRG2/174}

### FOREIGN TO FOREIGN POLICY

The main reason Gandhi had made Nehru India's first PM was his notion that Nehru had good international exposure and expertise in foreign affairs, and would project India well on the international stage. Nehru is credited as the founder of India's foreign policy. Founder he was, but were the foundations solid? Or, were they rickety? Or, were there no foundations at all? Was it all airy ad-hocism, and one-man's-pontifications? Crucially, was it a foreign policy that benefited India? Or, was it merely a device for Nehru for self-posturing and to project himself internationally?

If ours was a good foreign policy, how come all our major neighbours became our enemies? And, a friendly neighbour, Tibet, disappeared as an

independent nation? How come all our borders turned insecure during the Nehruvian era, costing us a fortune to defend them? How come no nation came to India's rescue (including Nehru's non-aligned or socialistcommunist friends) in its war with China, except the nation Nehru and Krishna Menon always panned—the United States{Red1} ; or the nation Nehru refused to recognise—Israel?{Hin1} You evaluate a policy by its results, not by its verbosity and pompousness. Wrote Walter Crocker:

"He [Nehru] insisted on keeping the portfolio of external affairs for himself. It was a disadvantage to him that he did so, because, as head of the whole government of India, he had to deal with a range of internal problems already too much for one mind. And it was a disadvantage to the Indian foreign office and the Indian diplomatic service. In effect he did damage to both, and at a formative and impressionable stage of their growth..."{Croc/56}

"…it was not a good service [Foreign Services in Nehru's day]—nothing like good enough for a country of India's importance. There was not enough training or professional competence, not enough esprit de corps, and too much eagerness to please the boss. Nehru was too busy and preoccupied to get to know the necessary detail, or to get to know the officers except for a handful of very senior ones or a few favourites. This encouraged sycophancy, personal ad hoc approaches, and a mixture of amateurishness and subjectivity. Indian embassies were too often sending back to Delhi the kind of reports which they thought would be congenial to their master. It was scarcely improved by the ambiguous position allowed to Krishna Menon, who in some fields was virtually the second foreign minister for five years or so prior to his fall in 1962…"{Croc/57}

This is what Dr Ambedkar had to say in his resignation (from the Nehru's cabinet) speech of 27 September 1951:

"The third matter which has given me cause, not merely for dissatisfaction but for actual anxiety and even worry, is the foreign policy of the country. Any one, who has followed the course of our foreign policy and along with it the attitude of other countries towards India, could not fail to realize the sudden change that has taken place in their attitude towards us. On 15th of August, 1947 when we began our life as an independent country, there was no country which wished us ill. Every country in the world was our friend. Today, after four years, all our friends have deserted us. We have no friends left. We have alienated

ourselves. We are pursuing a lonely furrow with no one even to second our resolutions in the U.N.O…"{Amb5}

Ambedkar criticised Nehru's foreign policy saying: "The key note of our foreign policy is to solve the problems of other countries and not to solve the problems of our own country!"{DK/456}

"Nehru rooted India's foreign policy in abstract ideas rather than a strategic conception of national interests. He disdained alliances, pacts, and treaties, seeing them as part of the old rules of realpolitik, and was uninterested in military matters... Nehru tended to put hope above calculation. When he was warned that Communist China would probably seek to annex Tibet, for example, he doubted it, arguing that it would be foolish and impractical adventure. And even after Beijing did annex Tibet in 1951, Nehru would not reassess the nature of Chinese interests along India's northern border…"

Nehru Admits his Folly

Nehru himself had this to admit: "We were getting out of touch with reality in the modern world and we were living in an artificial atmosphere of our creation."{Zak149}
