ERASURE OF TIBET AS A NATION

*This is our only foreign debt, and some day we must pay the Mantzu and the Tibetans for the provisions we were obliged to take from them.*

—Mao Zedong, when he had passed through the border regions of Tibet during the Long March

In the 8 th century, Tibetan King Trisong Dentsen had defeated China, which was forced to pay an annual tribute to Tibet. To put an end to mutual fighting, China and Tibet signed a treaty in 783 CE where boundaries were confirmed, and each country promised to respect the territorial sovereignty of the other. This fact is engraved on the stone monument at the entrance of the Jokhang temple, which still stands today. The engraving is both in Chinese and in Tibetan.

I [Sardar Patel] have been eating my heart out because I have not been able to make him [Nehru] see the dangers ahead. China wants to establish its hegemony over South-East Asia. We cannot shut our eyes to this because imperialism is appearing in a new garb...He is being misled by his courtiers. I have grave apprehensions about the future.

— *Durga Das, reporting his talks with Sardar Patel* {DD/305}

NEHRU LET TIBET BE ERASED AS <sup>A</sup> NATION

Nehru allowed Tibet, our peaceful neighbour and a buffer between us and China, to be erased as a nation, without even recording a protest in the UN, thereby making our northern borders insecure, and putting a question mark on the future of the water resources that originate in Tibet.

The Tibetan Government protested to the UN against the Chinese aggression. But, as Tibet was not a member of the UN, it was simply recorded by the UN Secretariat as an appeal from an NGO. Their appeal, in a way, was pigeonholed. In view of this handicap, Tibetans requested the Government of India to raise the Tibet issue in the UN. But, India was not willing to do so, lest China should feel antagonised! What to speak of helping our neighbour who had appealed to us for help, we shamelessly

advised the victim to seek peaceful settlement with the aggressor China. Even worse, when through others, the Tibet's appeal came up on 23 November 1950 for discussions in the UN General Assembly, we opposed the discussions on a very flimsy ground—that India had received a note from China that the matter would be resolved peacefully!

Even though China had invaded Tibet, KM Panikkar, the Indian Ambassador in Beijing, went so far as to pretend that there was lack of confirmation of the presence of Chinese troops in Tibet and that to protest the Chinese invasion of Tibet would show China in bad light—as an aggressor—which would have a negative effect on India's efforts of ensuring entry of China in the UN! Such was the crazy Nehru-Panikkar line! Tibet and our own national security interests were sought to be sacrificed to help China enter the UN!!

With no one to sponsor the Tibetan appeal, possibility of some joint action was discussed by the Commonwealth delegation to the UN. In the meeting, the Indian representative advised that India did not wish to raise the Tibetan issue in the UNSC, nor did India favour its inclusion in the UN General Assembly agenda!

*See the irony and the blunder* : Nehru referred to the UN what India should never have referred—the J&K issue, it being India's internal matter. But, Nehru refused to refer a matter to the UN that India should certainly have referred—Tibet, despite its criticality both to India's external security, and to the survival of a peaceful neighbour. When Nehru should not have acted, he did act; and when he should have acted, he didn't! Both, his action and his inaction, led to disastrous consequences for India. Nehru's strategy was India's and Tibet's tragedy.

### INDEPENDENT INDIA'S INDIFFERENT APPROACH

Given the critical importance of Tibet, India should have exerted its utmost to ensure Tibet retained its independent status. But, did India do so? Did India come to the rescue of its good neighbour, facing extinction as an independent entity? Did India fulfil its obligation as a friend and a neighbour? Did we come good on the trust that our weaker neighbour, Tibet, reposed in us?

Did Nehru walk the talk on anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism? Did India try to save its neighbour from being colonised? Did India try to

protect its own crucial interests? What role did India play? What was independent India's or Nehru's Tibet policy? Unfortunately—None. It was actually a defeatist policy—throw up your hands and declare there is nothing India can do to save Tibet.

India was in desperate need of a Sardar Patel to drive its strategic thinking. Nehru, by stating on 1 November 1950 in an interview to the Unites Press that "India has neither the resources nor the inclination to send armed assistance to Tibet"{Arpi/374} and that "We can't save Tibet" seemed to wash his hands off the whole affair so critical to India's security, and seemed to suggest that other than armed intervention, which India didn't wish to undertake, there was nothing India could do—when there was much that India could have very well done, other than its own armed intervention!

> BRITAIN WAS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT INDIA'S SECURITY COMPARED TO INDEPENDENT INDIA UNDER NEHRU!

While the independent India was an indifferent India—indifferent to its own security—British-India had done all it could to keep India's northern borders secure by ensuring Tibet remained free from foreign powers.

By the early nineteenth century, Tsarist Russia was trying to expand south into Central and South Asia. In response, Britain commenced its "Great Game"—that of checkmating Tsarist Russia. Britain rightly realised that Tibet as a buffer was vital to the security of British-India, particularly northern India. However, Britain did not wish to take the trouble of converting Tibet into a protectorate like Sikkim—it did not consider it financially worthwhile to commit resources for the purpose. Britain wanted Tibet to be neither under Russia nor under China. Autonomous or independent Tibet was the best bet to ensure security of northern India, and therefore the strategy was to ensure it remained so. Towards this end, the British took tremendous physical risks in surveying the border areas and sending missions through the difficult terrain to Tibet, spent considerable sum, did meticulous planning through the decades, arranged conventions, signed agreements, adjusted borders to make northern India as secure as possible—even engaged in "cartographic aggression". Trained Indian surveyor-spies, disguised as pilgrims or traders, counted their strides on their travels across Tibet, took readings at night, and measured the longitude, latitude and altitude of Lhasa and other places.

According to Claude Arpi:

"A few months before India's Independence, not only was Tibet a de facto independent State and the British wanted it to remain so, but they were ready to carry out a military action to protect Tibet's status. For this, a detailed military intervention plan was prepared by the General Staff of the British Army...The purpose of the Memo [a Top Secret Memo of 1946] was to find a solution in case of 'domination of Tibet by a potentially hostile major power [which] would constitute a direct threat to the security of India.'...Neither Russia nor China must be allowed to violate Tibetan autonomy...since it would then be possible for them to build roads and airfields to their own advantage, which would vitally affect India's strategic position."{Arpi/371}

That's foresight, strategic thinking and meticulous planning! Talking of strategic thinking, what to speak of viceroys and generals, even a British explorer, Francis Younghusband, who led the British Mission to Lhasa in 1904, had this to say in his book 'India and Tibet', first published in 1910:

"...apart from questions of trade, we want to feel sure that there is no inimical influence growing up in Tibet which might cause disturbance on our frontier [northern India]. That is the sum total of our wants. The trade is not of much value in itself, but, such as it is, is worth having. We have no interest in annexing Tibet...but we certainly do want quiet there... Before the Lhasa Mission, Russian influence...was the disturbing factor; now it is the Chinese influence, exerted beyond its legitimate limits and with imprudent harshness [reference to Zhao Erfeng's invasion of 1909]. Either of these causes results in a feeling of uneasiness, restlessness, and nervousness along our north-eastern frontier, and necessitates our assembling troops and making diplomatic protests..."{FY/420}

Wrote Brig. Dalvi: "In October 1950 I was a student at the Defence services Staff College in Wellington, South India. Soon after the news of the Chinese entry in into Tibet reached us, the Commandant, General WDA (Joe) Lentaigne, strode into the main lecture hall, interrupted the lecturer and proceeded to denounce our leaders for their short-sightedness and inaction, in the face of Chinese action...he said that India's back door had been opened...He predicted that India would have to pay dearly for failure to act...His last prophetic remark was that some of the students present in the hall would be fighting the Chinese before retirement."{JPD/15}

Olaf Caroe, Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department in 1945, and one of the foremost British strategic thinkers had

written:

"From the point of view of India's internal economy and administration the maintenance of this buffer [Tibet] between the frontiers of India and China is of great advantage. Recent wartime conditions have shown that China is a difficult neighbour… The more substantial the buffer that can be maintained between India and China, the better for future relations…"{Arpi/349}

Britain had been unambiguous in its approach: It didn't want a new neighbour to its north—neither China, nor the Soviet Union.

It can be said that from the Tibetan angle it was their misfortune India gained independence from the British in 1947. Had that independence been delayed, and had the British been still ruling India at the time of the Chinese aggression of Tibet in 1950, Britain would certainly not have just watched helpless—it would have ensured the Chinese were thrown out of Tibet. Alternately, it can be said that it was Tibet's misfortune that Nehru was then at the helm in India. Had it been Sardar Patel, or some other Patel-like leader, China would not have got the walk-over.

Significantly, while the British and China were well aware of the strategic importance of Tibet, India under Nehru remained irresponsibly ignorant. For Nehru, it was the convenient, laid-back, no-need-for-action 'Hindi-Chini-Bhai-Bhai' at all costs—even at the cost of the nation.

In sharp contrast to Nehru, there were notable prescient observers in addition to Sardar Patel, like KD Sethna of a Mumbai weekly 'Mother India', who wrote back in November 1950: "Let us not blink the fact that Tibet is useful to China principally as a gate of entry to India. Sooner or later attempts will be made to threaten us…"{Arpi/348}

## COULD CHINA HAVE BEEN PREVENTED?

China could have been prevented from taking over Tibet by bringing about international pressure. China was in a vulnerable position in 1950: it was fully committed in Korea and was by no means secure in its hold over the mainland. There would have been wide international support for the cause of Tibet, if India, the nation which had inherited from British-India the treaty with Tibet, and which was directly affected, had taken the initiative. The world opinion was strongly against the Chinese aggression, and all the countries were looking to India, the most affected country, to take the lead. Even if India did not wish to itself meddle militarily, it could

at least have helped the military efforts by others, or tried to thwart China diplomatically. The Economist wrote:

"Having maintained complete independence of China since 1912, Tibet has a strong claim to be regarded as an independent state. But it is for India to take a lead in this matter. If India decides to support independence of Tibet as a buffer state between itself and China, Britain and USA will do well to extend formal diplomatic recognition to it."{URL61}{URL62}

Writes Prasenjit Basu in 'Asia Reborn': "The Americans were keen to support Tibet's claim to sovereignty but needed support from India (or possibly Nepal) to solidify the claim. But the proto-communist Nehru (who believed, in his simple heart, that communism was the wave of the future, and the forces of history would inevitably lead to the triumph of communism) contemptuously brushed off the American offer of support. Nehru told his cabinet that it was not possible for India to help Tibet fend off the well-armed PLA (but he did not address the question of whether American support could have augmented the military potential of a combined effort)."{PB}

Wrote Dr NS Rajaram:{URL43}

"…It is nothing short of tragedy that the two greatest influences on Nehru at this crucial juncture in history were Krishna Menon and K.M. Panikkar, both communists… The truth is that India was in a strong position to defend its interests in Tibet, but gave up the opportunity for the sake of pleasing China. It is not widely known in India that in 1950, China could have been prevented from taking over Tibet... Patel on the other hand recognized that in 1950, China was in a vulnerable position, fully committed in Korea and by no means secure in its hold over the mainland. For months General MacArthur had been urging President Truman to 'unleash Chiang Kai Shek' lying in wait in Formosa (Taiwan) with full American support. China had not yet acquired the atom bomb, which was more than ten years in the future. India had little to lose and everything to gain by a determined show of force when China was struggling to consolidate its hold... In addition, India had international support, with world opinion strongly against Chinese aggression in Tibet. The world in fact was looking to India to take the lead... Nehru ignored Patel's letter as well as international opinion and gave up this golden opportunity to turn Tibet into a friendly buffer state. With such a

principled stand, India would also have acquired the status of a great power while Pakistan would have disappeared from the radar screen of world attention."{URL43}

Dr NS Rajaram further wrote: "*Much has been made of Nehru's blunder in Kashmir, but it pales in comparison with his folly in Tibet. As a result of this monumental failure of vision—and nerve—India soon came to be treated as a third rate power, acquiring 'parity' with Pakistan* ..."{URL43}

Even if India did not have the military strength to confront and prevent China, there were so many other steps that India could have taken: express disapproval; provide moral support to Tibet; lodge protest in the UN; mobilise world opinion against Chinese action; grant recognition to Tibet as an independent nation; persuade other nations to also do so; demand plebiscite in Tibet to ascertain the opinion of the public—China had agreed for a plebiscite in Mongolia, that led to its independence; work towards ensuring complete independence for Tibet through peaceful means. Even if the final favourable outcome took decades it didn't matter—at least there would have been hope. Had India taken the initiative many nations would have supported India. In fact, many did pass resolution in favour of Tibet in the UN later, which India, the affected country, did not support!

One could argue that doing so would have made China an enemy of India? Well, did China care for our friendship when it attacked our friend and neighbour Tibet? Are friendships only one-sided? Foreign policy cannot be based on cowardice! Or, in being too nice to the other party in the hope that they would reciprocate. The US felt disappointed to discover that India had resigned itself to leave Tibet to its fate, and sit back, and do nothing! The then US ambassador to India, Loy Henderson, described the Indian attitude as 'philosophic acquiescence'.

Several prominent Indian leaders and citizens decided to form a committee and observe the *Tibet Day* in August 1953 to protest Chinese invasion of Tibet. Nehru wrote to Balwantray Mehta of AICC on 24 August 1953:

"…Obviously, no Congressman should join such committee or participate in the observance of 'Tibet Day'. This is an unfriendly act to China and is against the policy we have pursued during these years. There is absolutely no reason for observing such a day now… I think we

should inform members of the Party that they should keep aloof from this. If you remind me, I shall mention this at the Party meeting tomorrow…"{JNSW/Vol-23/483}

#### NEHRU'S STRANGE & BAFFLING RATIONALIZATION

Reportedly, Nehru tried to rationalise India's inaction on various pretexts, the most bizarre among them being that Tibetan society was backward and feudal, and that reforms were bound to upset the ruling elite, and so on. Wrote Walter Crocker: "It was being said in Delhi in 1952-53 that *Nehru, in private and semi-private, justified the Chinese invasion of Tibet* ..."{Croc/73} Says Arun Shourie in "Are we deceiving ourselves again?":

"Panditji has now come down firmly against the order in Tibet: it isn't just that we cannot support Tibet. His position now is that *we must not support Tibet* . The reason is his progressive view of history! The Tibet order is feudal. And how can we be supporting feudalism?{AS/79}

"Panditji reiterates the other reasons for neither acting nor regretting the fact of not acting: 'We must remember that Tibet has been cut off from the world for a long time and, socially speaking, is very backward and feudal. Changes are bound to come there to the disadvantage of the small ruling class and the big monasteries... I can very well understand these feudal chiefs being annoyed with the new order. We can hardly stand up as defenders of feudalism.'"{AS/100}

Crazy, perplexing and inexplicable! What does Nehru's logic lead to? It is all right for a country that is backward and feudal to be taken over by another country if that would help it progress! By that logic, the USA could have colonised most of Asia and Africa that was backward and feudal including India, which also fell in that category—and Nehru would have been fine with that! And, how was the brutal communism of China superior to Buddhist feudalism!!

#### WHY THE UNTENABLE APPROACH?

Why did Nehru operate in such a way?

*One* . *Sacrifice the meek, and satisfy the bully* . Wrote Arun Shourie: "...response of the [Indian] Government has been to be at its craven best in

the belief, presumably, that, *if only we are humble enough to the python, it will not swallow us..."* {AS/26} Said Winston Churchill: *"An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last."* It was like substituting a very peaceful and harmless neighbour for a dangerous bully. Watching the way India capitulated, Chinese perhaps developed contempt for India and its leaders. Mao respected only the strong, and not the weak who bent over backwards to please him. India's pusillanimity must have emboldened China.

*Two* . *It suited Nehru temperamentally* . Nehru was a pacifist, and did not have a stomach to face up to difficult situations. What was the result? Those who abandon their friends and neighbours, especially weaker ones, in their difficulties, should know that their own time would also come. And it came. As India realised in 1962. What was once a most secure border became the most insecure border, thanks to Nehru.

President Dr Rajendra Prasad had famously remarked, "*I hope I am not seeing ghosts and phantoms, but I see the murder of Tibet recoiling on India* ."{RP2} He had also written: "In the matter of Tibet, we acted unchivalrously, but even against our interest in not maintaining the position of a buffer state, for it had thus exposed the frontier of 2,500 miles to the Chinese… I have very strong feeling about it. I feel that the *blood of Tibet is on us* … but the Prime Minister does not like the name of Tibet to be mentioned even now and regards any mention of its liberation as 'manifest nonsense'."{KMM/Vol-1/289}

*Three* . *Nehru's Marxist-Communist World View* (Blunder#106-7) dictated that communist countries could not be imperialists—despite ample factual evidence to the contrary, especially with regard to the Soviet Union.

## NEHRU ADMITS HIS BLUNDER

During his last days in 1964, Nehru was reported to have said: "*I have been betrayed by a friend. I am sorry for Tibet* ." Betrayal? One does not understand! In international politics, if you are naive and incompetent to take care of your own interests, you would keep getting betrayed.

#### PANCHSHEEL—SELLING TIBET; HARMING SELF

"*This great doctrine [Panchsheel] was born in sin, because it was enunciated to put the seal of our approval upon the destruction of an ancient nation which was associated with us spiritually and culturally... It was a nation which wanted to live its own life and it sought to have been allowed to live its own life* ..."

—Acharya Kriplani{Arpi2}

Despite what China did to Tibet, India signed the 'Panchsheel Agreement' with China on 29 April 1954. The agreement itself was titled "Agreement on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet region of China and India" thus acknowledging Tibet as a part of China. India gained nothing through the Agreement, and all benefits accrued to China. Chinese leaders must have been laughing at the naivete of the Indian leadership.

India did not even insist on prior settlement of borders. Reportedly, Girija Shankar Bajpai of the External Affairs Ministry had advised on settlement of the borders prior to the signing of Panchsheel, but his suggestion was ignored by all the three concerned: KM Panikkar, Krishna Menon, and Nehru. Our ambassador to China, KM Panikkar, was later derisively referred to as "ambassador of China".

Dalai Lama wrote poignantly in his autobiography, "Yet I was conscious that outside Tibet the world had turned its back on us. Worse, India, our nearest neighbour and spiritual mentor, had tacitly accepted Peking's claim to Tibet. In April 1954, Nehru had signed a new Sino-Indian treaty which included a memorandum known as *Panchsheel* ...According to this treaty, Tibet was part of China."{DL/113}

Acharya Kripalani had said on the floor of the Parliament in 1954:

"Recently we have entered into a treaty with China [Panchsheel]. I feel that China, after it had gone Communist, committed an act of aggression against Tibet. The plea is that China had an ancient right of suzerainty. This right was out of date, old and antiquated. It was never exercised in fact. It had lapsed by the flux of time. Even if it had not lapsed, it is not right in these days of democracy by which our Communist friends swear, by which the Chinese swear, to talk of this ancient suzerainty and exercise it in new form in a country which had and has nothing to do

with China... England went to war with Germany not because Germany had invaded England, but because it had invaded Poland and Belgium…"{AS/137}

Dr Ambedkar disagreed with the Tibet policy of India and felt that "there is no room for Panchsheel in politics". He said that "if Mr Mao had any faith in the Panchsheel, he certainly would treat the Buddhists in his own country in a very different way."

Dr Ambedkar also commented: "The Prime Minister has practically helped the Chinese to bring their border down to the Indian border. Looking at all these things it seems to me that it would be an act of levity not to believe that India, if it is not exposed to aggression right now, is exposed to aggression…"{DK/455-6}

Wrote Walter Crocker in 'Nehru: A Contemporary's Estimate':

"India, step by step, renounced the hard-won special position in Tibet which Britain had bequeathed to her, and she accepted Chinese suzerainty in principle and Chinese sovereignty in fact. Nehru dismissed the notion of Tibet as a buffer state—'A buffer between whom?'—and described India's previous special position there as an outmoded relic of imperialism. India's renunciation was sealed in a series of Sino-Indian agreements, the most important being the Agreement on Trade and… signed in 1954 [Panchsheel]…"{Croc/74-75}

India did this despite its own stand to the contrary earlier. The flag of Tibet was put up on 15 August 1947 in the Parliament, acknowledging Tibet as a separate nation. Right up to 1949, Nehru, in his official communications, used words like the Tibet Government, our two countries, and so on, leaving no doubt that India recognised Tibet as a separate, independent nation.

Panchsheel is actually a most eloquent example of the naivety of the Indian diplomacy and a shining example of what an international agreement should NOT be! Yet, upon criticism of the Panchsheel in parliament, Nehru had brazenly stated that in the realm of foreign affairs he could never take so much credit as for the India-China settlement over Tibet! An amazingly self-deluding assertion indeed!!

#### NOT SETTLING BOUNDARY DISPUTE WITH CHINA

Nehru failed to negotiate with China on a peaceful settlement of borders, so vital to India's security. Doing so was not difficult considering that China at that time was not strong, had numerous external and internal problems to contend with, and was therefore willing for a "give and take", particularly 'Aksai Chin—McMahon Line swap': recognition of McMahon Line by China in return for India's recognition of China's claim on Aksai Chin, with minor adjustments.

STATUS OF INDIA-CHINA BORDER AT INDEPENDENCE

India had borders with Tibet, but not with China. However, after the forcible annexation of Tibet by China in 1950 and its mute acceptance by India, what were Indo-Tibetan borders became Indo-China borders.

As part of the *Great Game* that Britain played of check-mating Russia which was expanding south into Asia, Britain made adjustments to the northern boundaries of India—some with the consent of the other party and some without—to keep northern India safe from Russia and China. Britain was adept at cartographic aggression, unilateral cartographic changes and cartographic flip-flops, adjusting the boundaries to suit its strategic requirements, that varied with times. *That left free India a bad legacy of unclear and disputed borders* .

Two Major Disputed Border-Regions

(1) Aksai Chin

Aksai Chin ('The Desert of White Stones') is to the north of Ladakh. It is located at a height of between 17,000 to 19,000 feet. Its eastern border touches Tibet, and the northern border touches Xinjiang province of China. Aksai Chin was in physical possession of China, and they had built a highway there in the 1950s joining Tibet with Xinjiang [Sinkiang], there being no other land-route to connect the two. Aksai Chin was uninhabited, barren and of no strategic or economic importance for India; and considering India had no legally sound claim on it (please see the history below), there was little point, and indeed unwise, for Nehru to act adamant on it, especially when China was prepared for a quid pro quo on the

McMahon Line in the northeast. General Thimayya had himself stated in 1959 that Aksai Chin was of no strategic significance for India.

### *Border History related to Aksai Chin*

A 'Boundary Commission' set up by Britain in 1847 tasked to determine the eastern border of J&K had considered the traditional natural eastern boundary of Ladakh formed by the Karakorum ranges as adequate, pointing out also the possible disputed position of Demchok. Aksai Chin fell beyond the Karakorum ranges into Tibet, that became part of China in 1950.

In 1892 China erected a boundary marker at the Karakoram Pass with an inscription that the Chinese territory began there, and laid claim to the Karakoram Pass, Shahidulla and the tract between the Kuen Lun ranges and the Karakoram ranges, that included Aksai Chin. Britain didn't mind. All they wanted was that the area should be out of reach of the Russians—in those days Britain was worried about Russia, and not China, which it considered a weak, harmless nation. In the connection, the British Foreign Department had noted:

"…We had always hoped that they [Chinese] would assert effectively their rights to Shahidulla and the tract between Kuen Lun and Karakoram range [which included Aksai Chin]… We see no occasion to remonstrate with China on account of erection of the boundary pillar… We favour the idea of getting 'no mans' land filled up by the Chinese, subject to future delimitation of boundaries."{DW/54-55}

In 1899 Macartney-MacDonald Ladakh-Tibet line was proposed by Britain to the Chinese Government, which had left Aksai Chin to Tibet. The Karakoram Mountains formed a natural boundary for this border. This Line was presented to the Chinese by the British Minister in Peking, Sir Claude MacDonald. The Chinese did not respond to the note, and the British took that as Chinese acquiescence. This Line is approximately the same as the current Line of Actual Control in Ladakh. Britain never attempted to make a physical presence in Aksai Chin or exert authority there in any form. Postindependence Indian government also took no steps to actually extend their control beyond the Karakoram range into the Aksai Chin plains.

That the British Government continued to hold to the above proposal (which included Aksai Chin as part of Tibet) was confirmed in the map

accompanying the Shimla Convention (please see details further down) of 1914.{Max/35}

Significantly, the maps of the Survey of India were showing the northern borders as 'Boundary Undefined' till 1954 like the British had been showing. In his book, AG Noorani mentions that a map annexed to the Mountbatten's Report on his Viceroyalty labelled these boundaries as 'Boundary Undefined'.{Noor/210} Map annexed to a White Paper on Indian States released in July 1948 by the Ministry of States under Sardar Patel also did not show these borders as clearly defined{Noor/221} . However, the maps were unilaterally altered after July 1954 at the instance of Nehru, and began to show a clear, demarcated border—that included Aksai Chin—as unilaterally decided by India.

### (2) McMahon Line

The McMahon Line was finalised in the Shimla Convention of 1914. The Shimla Convention arranged by the British, to which Tibet and China were invited and were represented by Lonchen Shastra and Ivan Chen respectively, conducted eight formal sessions between 6 October1913 and 3 July 1914. Sir Henry McMahon, the then foreign secretary of British-India, was the chief negotiator and the British Plenipotentiary at the Convention, assisted by Charles Bell. Lonchen Shastra and Ivan Chen had to get orders and clarifications from Lhasa and Nanjing respectively, that took a long time on account of the distances and conventional communication network; and that was the reason the Convention stretched for so long a period—about 10 months.

China initially objected to the presence of Tibet in the Convention saying it had no independent status and was part of China, but then went along fearing Britain may proceed unilaterally with Tibet, like Russia did with Mongolia, ignoring China.

The Convention proposed granting China control over *Inner Tibet* while recognizing the autonomy of *Outer Tibet* under the Dalai Lama's rule. Outer Tibet comprised Western and Central Tibet including Lhasa, Chamdo and Shigatse, and areas skirting the British-India frontier; while Inner Tibet included Amdo and part of Kham. Both China and Britain were to respect the territorial integrity of Tibet, and abstain from interference in the administration of Outer Tibet. Further Outer Tibet could not be converted into a province of China.

The border between northeast India and Tibet was also discussed and finalised between Tibet and British-India during the Convention—it came to be known as the McMahon Line*.* China was not invited to the discussions on the McMahon Line because it was a boundary settlement between Tibet and India, and not between China and India. It was not a secret negotiation, and China knew about it—and raised no objections.

Ivan Chen initialled the draft Convention on 27 April 2014. However, two days later, on 29 April 2014, China repudiated Chen's action and refused to proceed with full signature. It is worth noting that China refrained from full signature not because it had problems with Inner– Outward Tibet per se, but because Tibet and China could not agree to the dividing line between the two. Britain and Tibet signed the Convention on July 3, 1914.{Arpi/126} Even as late as 1947, China, under the Nationalists, had conveyed to the then Indian government they didn't recognise the McMahon Line.

The text of the draft Convention or that of the final Convention did not specifically and explicitly talk about the Indo-Tibetan border or the *McMahon Line* at all, the Line was shown only in the annexed map. Article IX of the Convention simply and briefly stated: "For the purpose of the present Convention the borders of Tibet, and the boundary between Outer and Inner Tibet, shall be shown in red and blue respectively on the map attached hereto."

The *McMahon Line* was a thick red-line drawn on a double-page map, hence it is inaccurate and susceptible to alternate interpretations and disputes. As proper follow-up protocols that should have used cartographic techniques to identify the location of the agreed line on the ground through a joint survey were not taken up, the line remained inexact, leaving scope for controversial claims. The Indian maps showed it as a dashed/brokenline till 1954 to indicate it was roughly defined but not yet demarcated, that is, marked on the ground consequent to a ground survey. However, after July 1954, the Indian maps began showing it as a solid line indicating it was well-demarcated—at the instance of Nehru!

Through the McMahon Line, McMahon had effectively advanced the borders of British-India further north and added 50,000 odd square miles of territory that was till then administered by Tibet, including Tawang, that had the famous Tibetan-Buddhist monastery. Tawang was on the trade-route and

British desired control over it. Though reluctant, Tibet agreed to the giveaway as a bargain for its rights on the Outer Tibet.

Later, the Tibetans claimed they had most reluctantly agreed for Tawang and other areas (which till then were theirs), as part of British-India—that is, their depiction to the south of the McMahon Line—as a quid pro quo for Britain keeping its part of the bargain: getting China to agree to Outer/Inner Tibet and sign the Convention. Since China had refused to sign the Convention, not only the Tibetans had a right to both the Outer and Inner Tibet, they also had claims on Tawang and such other areas relinquished by them then. Soon after Indian independence, Tibet had asked India for return of the territories on its boundary acquired by the British!

With India having agreed to Tibet being a part of China, and not an independent nation, a doubt was implicitly cast upon the validity of the treaties which were agreed to by Tibet, but not by China. India effectively did a self-goal through its Tibet policy—Dalai Lama rightly pointed out that to deny the sovereign status of Tibet when the McMahon Line was agreed to in 1914 was to deny the validity of the McMahon Line itself.

WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE POST-INDEPENDENCE

India should not have allowed Tibet, which was a buffer with China, to disappear as an independent nation. That blunder (Blunder#33) having been done, the following sensible steps should have been taken:

*Step-1* **:** Both India and China should have taken stock of the fact of unsettled borders, and let the public in both the countries know of the same, lest there be any wrong impression, false propaganda, and unwarranted politics.

*Step-2* **:** A team comprising experts from both the countries should have done ground survey and should have tried to define the boundaries.

*Step-3* **:** Those areas that the expert-team failed to resolve could have been left for further discussions at a higher level, where they could have been resolved in a spirit of give and take.

But, were the above sensible steps taken? Unfortunately, no! Contrary to expectations, one is shocked to learn that while China was agreeable for these sensible steps, India was not! Nehru had other ideas—odd, brazen and unreasonable!! Please see below.

INDIA UNILATERALLY CHANGED MAPS IN JULY-1954

In his memo of 1 July 1954 to the Secretary General of the Ministry of External Affairs and the Foreign Secretary, Nehru's directives were [*comments in italics within square brackets by author* ]:{JNSW/Vol-26/481-2}

"6. In future, we should give up references, except in some historical context, to the McMahon Line or any other frontier line by date or otherwise. We should simply refer to our frontier. Indeed, the use of the name McMahon is unfortunate and takes us back to the British days of expansion.

[*But, then, Nehru was not talking of a new, proper, just line/boundary mutually negotiated between independent India and China after junking the colonial McMahon Line of the imperialist/expansionist Britain. He was all for sticking to the colonially laid down lines like McMahon Line —only he didn't want the legacy of the British names, which lent a negative, expansionist flavour* .]

"7. All our old maps dealing with this frontier should be carefully examined and, where necessary, withdrawn. New maps should be printed showing our Northern and North Eastern frontier without any reference to any 'line'. These new maps should also not state there is any undemarcated territory. The new maps should be sent to our Embassies abroad and should be introduced to the public generally and be used in our schools, colleges, etc.

"8. Both as flowing from our policy and as consequence of our Agreement with China [*which agreement?* ], this frontier should be considered a firm and definite one which is not open to discussion with anybody. There may be very minor points of discussions. Even these should not be raised by us. It is necessary that the system of check-posts should be spread along the entire frontier. More especially, we should have check-posts in such places as might be considered disputed areas.

"9. …Check-posts are necessary not only to control traffic, prevent unauthorised infiltration but as a symbol of India's frontier. As Demchok is considered by the Chinese as a disputed territory, we should locate a check-post there. So also at Tsang Chokla…"{JNSW/Vol-26/481-2}

This decision of Nehru was fraught with risks because the new maps of 1954 publicly committed India to a cartographic position that was known to have been of ambiguous provenance. Nehru aligned himself with the maximalist position of the British on the northern borders, whether or not

agreed to by China or Tibet in the past, declared them as well-demarcated Indian borders, even where the British had themselves shown the border as undefined. Nehru also formulated a policy where no talks or discussions or negotiations were to be encouraged on boundary issues. Even in new maps, we made blunders. Kuldip Nayar states in 'Beyond the Lines':

"To India's dismay our maps showed some of our territory as part of China. The home ministry wrote to the states asking them to burn the maps or at least smudge the border with China on the Assam side because they did not exactly delineate the Indian border. The Chinese exploited our confusion and used our maps to question our claim."{KN}

Even if one assumes, for the sake of argument, that the new Indian maps were drawn with due care after ascertaining the historical facts and the traditional boundaries, and India had sufficient justification for what it claimed as its boundary; the critical question is: Were the borders agreed to by the other party? Did India possess agreements, documents and maps to prove its claims? If not, should India not have discussed with China and tried to convince them of India's position? India could have taken the maximalist position to start with in the negotiations. But, negotiations India should have done. A unilaterally-drawn map is a mere cartographic claim, it is not a title to land. It settles nothing, it can have no legal or international acceptance, unless concurred with by the other party. Simply said, it takes two to settle a boundary.

CHINA'S STAND & WILLINGNESS FOR <sup>A</sup> NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT

As brought out above, historically, China had not agreed to any border with India and signed any boundary agreement, except for the borders with Sikkim.

The stand of the Peoples Republic of China from 1949 onwards was that they wanted to remove the blot of the British imperialist humiliation China had suffered with regard to the borders and on other matters, and rather than accepting the unjust and illegal British-drawn borders, they desired discussions, negotiations and a joint ground survey to settle the borders in a just and mutually acceptable manner in the spirit of give and take, and not with a view to grab area they were not entitled to. They also wanted to dispense with the British-given names, and give the boundaries new Indian– Chinese names.

Chinese communists, having just ascended the power in 1949, desired a settled border, especially because they already had several severe headaches —internal troubles, Korea, Taiwan, Tibet and a belligerent US—and didn't want to add to them.

CHINA SETTLES BORDERS PEACEFULLY WITH OTHER COUNTRIES

That the above was so was proved by the agreement China finalised with Myanmar (Burma) in 1960—the new Burma-China border is roughly along the McMahon Line, with certain adjustments accepted by both the sides. China also settled its boundaries amicably through negotiations with Nepal and Pakistan, and signed boundary agreements. India remained the only exception.

NEHRU'S UNREASONABLE STAND & UNWILLINGNESS TO NEGOTIATE

China did try on several occasions to settle India-China borders through negotiations and took initiatives in that direction, but what should have happened—peaceful, negotiated settlement through talks—did not happen, for Nehru had his own ideas, like unilaterally changing the maps (as detailed above), claiming the borders are already settled, and refusing to negotiate.

In July 1952, China proposed settlement through peaceful negotiations of India's inherited rights and assets in Tibet, and the related issues, that obviously included the borders. However, Nehru & Co decided in their wisdom not to raise border issues. Why? It might open the Pandora's box and open up the whole border for negotiations. What was the way out? Claim borders were already settled, and therefore there was nothing to negotiate!

The Indian Ambassador to China KM Panikkar had advised: "[If] China raises the issue [of the McMahon Line], we can plainly refuse to reopen the question and take our stand that the Prime minister took [in his public statement], that the territory on this side of the McMahon Line is ours, and that there is nothing to discuss about it."{Max/77}

It was this self-deluding approach that led Nehru&Co not to discuss and settle the boundary issue when they signed the only-give-give-and-no-take Panchsheel Agreement with China in 1954.

However, Sir Girija Shankar Bajpai who had been the Secretary-General in the Ministry of External Affairs did not agree with the above stand, and

pointed out that China had asked for settlement of pending problems, and that the Chinese "never having accepted the McMahon Line as the frontier between Tibet and us, can hardly regard this frontier as settled. Naturally, they have no intention of raising it until it suits their convenience."{Max/77}

Nehru had advised the Secretary General of the Ministry of External Affairs on 3 December 1953: "I agree about the attitude we should take up in regard to the frontier, we should not raise this question [of boundaries]. If the Chinese raise it, we should express our surprise and point out that this [boundaries] is a settled issue..."{JNSW/Vol-24/598}

As per Neville Maxwell's "India's China War":

"India reiterated that her boundaries with China could not be a matter of negotiation, claiming that they stood defined 'without the necessity of further or formal delimitation'. China replied that 'this attitude…of refusing to negotiate and trying to impose a unilaterally claimed alignment on China is in actuality refusal to settle the boundary question'; and she warned that while India maintained that position and kept up her 'unreasonable tangling', China would 'absolutely not retreat an inch' from her own stand. That China was equably and equitably settling her boundaries with her neighbours tended to throw an adverse light on India's position. Peking prodded at that sore point: 'Since the Burmese and Nepalese Governments can settle their boundary questions with China in a friendly way through negotiations and since the Government of Pakistan has also agreed…to negotiate a boundary settlement, why is it that the Indian Government cannot negotiate and settle its boundary question…'"{Max/214}

India avoided raising the border issue with China following Nehru's decision—even when Panchsheel was signed in 1954, and later when Zhou Enlai had overlong five rounds of discussions with Nehru between 25 and 27 June 1954{JNSW/Vol-26/365-406} . For over a decade since the independence, Nehru talked with Zhou Enlai on everything under the Sun except the boundary issues. Records quoted in various books on the subject show that Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai did raise the boundary matter with Nehru several times, but India soft-peddled or avoided the issue. China was also not insistent. No objections or protests from the Chinese were taken to mean their acquiescence to our position. So, as a "strategy", India maintained silence, kept mum on the issue.

This is from 'Beyond the Lines' by Kuldip Nayar:

"...I was only the home ministry's information officer and had no official locus standi, but it was obvious that the Polish ambassador was on a mission. He invited me for a chat at his chancery and expected me to convey what he had said to [Gobind Ballabh] Pant [Nehru's Home Minister]. At the beginning of the conversation he said that the proposal he would make had the support of all Communist countries, and specifically mentioning the Soviet Union. His proposal was that India should accept a package political deal, getting recognition for the McMahon Line in exchange for handing over control of some areas in Ladakh [Aksai Chin] to China. He said that the areas demanded had never been charted, and nobody could say to whom they belonged. What was being claimed to be India's was what had been forcibly occupied by the UK. No power could honour 'the imperialist line', nor should India insist upon it. Whatever the odds, China would never part with the control of the road it had built. That was lifeline between Sinkiang and other parts of China, he argued. I conveyed the proposal to Pant who gave me no reaction, his or that of the government."{KN}

In response to a very long letter of Nehru of 26 September 1959, wrote Chou En-Lai on 7 November 1959:{URL21}

"…As the Sino-Indian boundary has never been delimited and it is very long and very far or comparatively far from the political centres of the two countries, I am afraid that, if no fully appropriate solution is worked out by the two Governments, border clashes which both sides do not want to see may again occur in the future. And once such a dash takes place, even though a minor one, it will be made use of by people who are hostile to the friendship of our two countries to attain their ulterior objectives…

"Your Excellency's letter of September 26 contains many viewpoints to which the Chinese Government cannot agree…

"In order to maintain effectively the status quo of the border between the two countries, to ensure the tranquillity of the border regions and to create a favourable atmosphere for a friendly settlement of the boundary question, the Chinese Government proposes that the armed forces of China and India each withdraw 20 kilometres at once from the so-called McMahon Line in the east, and from the line up to which each side exercises actual control in the west, and that the two sides undertake to

refrain from again sending their armed personnel to be stationed in and patrol the zones from which they have evacuated their armed forces, but still maintain civil administrative personnel and unarmed police there for the performance of administrative duties and maintenance of order… In a word, both before and after the formal delimitation of the boundary between our two countries through negotiations, the Chinese Government is willing to do its utmost to create the most peaceful and most secure border zones between our two countries, so that our two countries will never again have apprehensions or come to a clash on account of border issues. If this proposal of the Chinese Government is acceptable to the Indian Government, concrete measures for its implementation can be discussed and decided upon at once by the two Governments through diplomatic channels…

"The Chinese Government proposes that in order to further discuss the boundary question and other questions in the relations between the two countries, the Prime Ministers of the two countries hold talks in the immediate future…"{URL21}

After several incidents and exchanges of letters between the two countries to diffuse the situation, China wrote in December 1959 repeating its stand on the border but suggesting maintenance of the status quo pending formal delimitation of the border and withdrawal of the armed forces of the two sides by 20km or so on either side, and stoppage of patrolling by the armed forces. Nehru strangely continued to maintain the borders were settled and there was nothing to negotiate.

Zhou Enlai, Marshal Chen Yi, Foreign Minister, and a big official Chinese delegation visited New Delhi in 1960 to settle the border dispute. The Chinese position was the same as what Zhou had earlier conveyed in writing to India on several occasions. However, China was reportedly willing to accept the McMahon Line as the boundary in the east—with possibly some adjustments and a new name—like they had done with Myanmar (Burma) provided, in return, India dropped its claims over Aksai Chin. Once this broad framework was agreed to, the officials from the two countries could do a survey and determine the exact alignments of the borders. Unfortunately, adhering to his stated position, Nehru declined.

Finding the deadlock, Zhou then suggested steps similar to his letter of December 1959 to diffuse the situation till an amicable settlement was

reached. Nothing came of these.

Chou had come with high hopes after having settled the borders with Burma, but left disappointed—he articulated Chinese position in a pressconference at Delhi before leaving and expressed his disappointment. Reportedly, Zhou found Nehru's adamant stand on Aksai Chin inexplicable and unexpected for several reasons: (a)India had never occupied or ruled or set its foot in Aksai Chin; (b)in the opinion of China, India had no valid and legal ground to lay claim on it; (c)it was barren and nothing grew there; and (d)it was of no strategic or economic importance for India.

Wrote Walter Crocker in 'Nehru: A Contemporary's Estimate':

"At all events, by 1956-57 Chinese were highly suspicious of India. By the time the Indian Forward Policy was launched they were convinced of trickery and bad faith… There is evidence that after his talks with Nehru in 1954 and in 1955, increasingly in 1956, and again in 1960, Chou Enlai came to feel that he had got little understanding with Nehru, and that Nehru was not straight. Nehru's manner and indirectness had over the years caused more than one interlocutor to feel like that… According to a foreign minister of a certain Asian country, Chou En-lai, speaking about the Sino-Indian boundary dispute, told him that Nehru was impossible to negotiate with, being both unreliable and impenetrable…"{Croc/85}

Apparently, the 'wise' and the 'self-proclaimed-expert-in-internationalaffairs' Nehru thought that by being assertive about what India had unilaterally decided were its boundaries, the 'not-so-wise' China would ultimately buckle and agree to India's unilateral claims! It didn't matter that India had no undisputed maps and mutually-agreed documents to back up its assertiveness. Nehru's assertiveness and adamance were misplaced—he should have shown that while dealing with the Tibet issue (Blunder#33).

Even after the first phase of 1962 India-China war that lasted four days (20–23 October 1962) China issued a statement and Zhou also wrote to Nehru on 24 October 1962 setting out the terms of peaceful settlement of the border dispute: both parties withdraw 20km from the line of actual control and disengage; the PMs of the two countries engage in friendly settlement of the dispute. India questioned what China meant by the line of actual control and wanted it to be the position as on 8 September 1962, while China, in its response of 4 November 1962, clarified it to be the position as on 7 November 1959, that is, the McMahon Line in the eastern

sector—even though China had not accepted that line—and the traditional line in the other sectors, emphasising what China offered met the India conditions of "decency, dignity and self-respect" and would not prejudice claims of either parties, which would be settled through negotiations. This also meant that China was not taking advantage of the territories it had gained meanwhile after the first phase of 1962 India-China war.

India did not agree reiterating that the line of actual control should be the position as on 8 September 1962. However, those were precisely the unacceptable Indian positions as on 8 September 1962 in what China considered to be its territory that led to the conflict on 20 October 1962 in the first place, and agreeing to the same would have meant China did something wrong in demolishing those positions it considered illegal. India remained adamant. China considered India's stand to be highly unreasonable.

After the initial four days of fighting (20–23 October 1962), there was a lull in fighting of about three weeks till 13 November 1962. Indian forces had meanwhile regrouped and they attacked the Chinese positions on 14 November 1962. China counter-attacked and by 20 November 1962 (within a week) the whole of NEFA was under the Chinese control, and they were at the gates of Assam.

China declared unilateral ceasefire on 21 November 1962. All nations, including of course India, were stunned by this sudden and unexpected turn. The terms were the same as what China had offered earlier on 24 October 1962 after the first round of fighting for 4 days since 20 October 1962. However, the main difference was that this was unilateral—China announced it would carry out its part of the obligation whether or not India agreed, that is, it would withdraw its forces 20km away from the line of actual control as on 7 November 1959. However, it reserved the right to strike back should India attack or try to cross the line of actual control to reoccupy the positions that were never in its territory.

India ceased fire knowing it could not fight on. However, sticking to its old stand, India did not agree, nor did it make an effort, to finally resolve the border-dispute once and for all through talks and negotiations, for which China was ready!

NEHRU HAD ADMITTED HIS MISTAKE, YET…

This is what Nehru had himself admitted in the Parliament in 1959: "*Seven or eight years ago I saw no reason to discuss the frontier with the Chinese Government because, foolishly if you like, I thought there was nothing to discuss* ."{AS/154}

What is the position now? India would be happy to do what China had repeatedly proposed in the 1950s and early 1960s, but what Nehru had declined. But, now being a super power, China is playing difficult. In personal life, as also in the life of a nation, what you don't do when it can and should be done, you fail to achieve later. Time and tide wait for none. Who is paying for the missed opportunities?

THE HIMALAYAN BLUNDER: INDIA-CHINA WAR

*Again and again, military men have seen themselves hurled into war by the ambition, passions and blunders of civilian governments, almost wholly uninformed as to the limits of their military potential and almost recklessly indifferent to the military requirements of the war they let loose.*  —Alfred Vagts, 'The History of Militarism'{Max/289}

India and China had a record going back thousands of years for never having fought a war between them. Nehru, through his unwise and illconsidered policies, broke that record, though unwillingly. Nehru's 'forward policy' and his failure in settling the borders resulted in India-China war and its consequent human and financial loss, besides loss of face for India and Indians before the international community. Here, we are talking of what India could control, not what China had in mind.

#### SUMMARISING HIMALAYAN BLUNDERS

It was not just one Himalayan blunder, but like the Himalayan range, a range of blunders by Nehru over a fifteen-year period since independence across domains—External Security, Defence, Foreign Policy, and so on that led to the disaster that shamed India and the Indians before the world.

The same are summarised below, followed by coverage of some of them in detail.

*Blunder-1.* Allowing Tibet to be annexed by China, and recognising China's claim over Tibet. This allowed Tibet-India borders to become China-India borders, bringing with them all the associated problems (Blunder#33 above).

*Blunder-2.* Not settling the border-issue with China, and being inflexible about it. (Blunder#35)

*Blunder-3.* Signing *Panchsheel* agreement with China in 1954 without first settling the borders. (Blunder#34)

*Blunder-4.* Change of Indian maps unilaterally after July 1954 without mutual discussions with the other party—China. (Blunder#35)

*Blunder-5.* Nehru's refusal to consider the proposal of the Chinese delegation in 1960 of East-West give-and-take swap on the McMahon Line and Aksai Chin. (Blunder#35)

*Blunder-6.* Ill-conceived, non-forward-looking Forward Policy of establishing indefensible border posts in disputed areas, provoking China, or giving China the excuse to attack. (Details further down)

*Blunder-7.* Absurd assumption on the part of Nehru and his close group that China would not attack even if India established certain posts in the disputed areas. (Details further down)

*Blunder-8.* Leaving the forward posts grossly under-manned and under-armed, with inadequate logistics in place. (Details further down)

*Blunder-9.* Politicisation of the army high command. Favouritism. Putting in place sycophants and submissive officers at top positions who would kowtow to political bosses. Eventually, some of these chosen submissive officers contributed to the humiliation of India. (Blunder#38)

*Blunder-10.* Gross neglect of defence and external security. (Blunder#37)

*Blunder-11.* Appointing an insufferably arrogant and incompetent protégé Krishna Menon as Defence Minister. (Blunder#38, 73)

*Blunder-12.* Nehru's indiscretion of publicly declaring on 12 October 1962, barely 8 days before the war started, that he had instructed the Army to "evict the Chinese"! Does one give operational orders publicly? Wars are meant to be waged silently and anonymously.

Mature nations and mature leaders are not expected to indulge in empty bluffs! There was no worth-while plan to either evict the Chinese, or to resist them if they attacked!! (Details further down)

*Blunder-13.* After mere 4 days of fighting, during which the damage had not been too much, China offered a ceasefire on 24 October 1962 suggesting withdrawal by 20km by both the sides from the line of actual control, followed by talks and negotiated settlement on the border-dispute. Nehru didn't agree! India's major humiliation in the war happened later after 14 November 1962—that could have been avoided, had India taken up the Chinese offer. (Details further down)

*Blunder-14.* On 21 November 1962 China declared unilateral ceasefire and offered the same terms it offered on 24 October 1962 and again suggested talks, discussions, joint ground survey and negotiated settlement. India agreed for ceasefire, but did not take up the offer for talks. It was worth resolving the dispute. (Details further down)

*Blunder-15.* Nehru should have done whatever it took to amicably settle the border-dispute with China, and should not have left it open for the generations to follow, like he did for Kashmir, because with the passage of time, as China became stronger and stronger, settlement became difficult. (Blunder#35)

*Blunder-16.* Nehru should have set up a fully-empowered Commission for a comprehensive enquiry into all aspects of the debacle with a mandate to recommend action against the negligent and the guilty, and suggestions for the steps to be taken going forward. The findings should have been made public. That was the minimum expected of a democratic country but, nothing of the sort was done. (Blunder#41)

*Blunder-17.* Nehru should have resigned in the aftermath of the rout. Not just offered to resign—the offer he didn't make anyway—he should have actually resigned or should have been made to resign. Democratic norms demanded it. It would have been a good lesson for the future politics of India—you can't do a series of major blunders, yet continue in power. Not just as a lesson, but also on account of its beneficial effects. Had he resigned another competent person—and there were many—who would not have carried Nehru's baggage, would have looked at the issue afresh and reached a permanent settlement on the borders with China. (Blunder#42)

ILL-CONCEIVED FORWARD POLICY

With Nehru–Krishna Menon deciding to unilaterally fix India's border with China, India went ahead with its plan of physical presence on the frontiers. It began building forward check-posts under its hare-brained Forward Policy—which was actually a "bluff" masquerading as a military strategy. Their locations were as per the border unilaterally determined by India, and not as per any mutual discussions or agreement with China. There was, therefore, a possibility of China's objection, and even Chinese action to demolish the posts. The fact was that the boundaries were not settled, so what was say within Indian boundary for India, may have been within Chinese boundary for China. If you had not settled the boundaries, controversies were bound to arise (Blunder#35). But, rather than negotiating a boundary with China and reaching a peaceful settlement, Nehru-Menon & Co, in their wisdom—their Forward Policy—convinced themselves that it is they who would determine the boundary, and in token thereof, establish their posts, like markers. That China could object, and then attack and demolish those posts, and even move forward into India did not seem to them a possibility. Why? Because, reasoned Nehru: any such "reckless" action by China would lead to world war, and China would not precipitate such a thing! That what they were themselves doing was also "reckless" did not apparently strike the wise men!

The decision on the 'Forward Policy' was reportedly taken at the PMO on 2 November 1961 in a meeting attended by Nehru, Krishna Menon, General PN Thapar (COAS), Lieutenant General BM Kaul (CoGS), BN Mullik (Director–IB), Brig. DK Palit, and the then Foreign Secretary. {KNR/205- 6}

Wrote Kuldip Nayar in 'Beyond the Lines':

"Nehru ordered that police check-posts be established to register India's presence in the Ladakh area. As many as 64 posts were built, but they were not tenable. Home Secretary Jha told me that it was the 'bright idea' of B.N. Malik, the director of intelligence, to set up police posts 'wherever we could', even behind the Chinese lines, in order to 'sustain our claim' on the territory. This was Nehru's 'Forward policy', but then Jha said, 'Malik does not realise that these isolated posts with no support from the rear would fall like ninepins if there was a push from the Chinese side. We have unnecessarily exposed the policemen [Assam Rifles were posted] to death.' He went on to say: 'Frankly, this is the job

of the army, but as it has refused to man the posts until full logistical support is provided, New Delhi has pushed the police.'"{KN}

Arun Shourie quotes Nehru in 'Are we deceiving ourselves again?': "It is completely impracticable for the Chinese Government to think of anything in the nature of invasion of India. Therefore I rule it out... It is necessary that the system of check-posts should be spread along this entire frontier. More especially, we should have check-posts in such places as might be considered disputed areas... As Demchok is considered by the Chinese as a disputed territory, we should locate a check-post there. So also at Tsang Chokla..."{Noor/223-4}{AS/103}

China seemed to have viewed India's Forward Policy as a deliberate attempt to usurp Chinese territory, and provoke war. As things stood, China was suspicious of India's intentions. Wrote Rustamji: "His [Nehru's] mistake was that he did not accept or realise how our 'forward policy' was being received in China."{Rust/215} Several analysts, including Neville Maxwell{Max} , are of the opinion that Nehru's ill-conceived Forward Policy that was rolled-out December 1961 onwards was at the root of the 1962 India-China War.

"Mao commented on Nehru's Forward Policy with one of his epigrams: 'A person sleeping in a comfortable bed is not easily aroused by someone else's snoring.'...[commented Mao:] 'Since Nehru sticks his head out and insists on us fighting him, for us not to fight with him would not be friendly enough. Courtesy emphasises reciprocity.'"

—Henry Kissinger, 'On China'{HK/L-3012}

## NO PREPARATION—YET, ORDERS TO THROW OUT THE CHINESE!

In response to a reporter's query, Nehru grandly declared at the airport on 12 October 1962 on his way to Ceylon[Sri Lanka] that he had already "ordered the armed forces to clear the Chinese from the NEFA".{URL23} {MB2/137}

Confirming the above, on October 14, Indian Defence Minister V.K. Krishna Menon told a meeting of Congress workers at Bangalore that the Government had come to a final decision to 'drive out the Chinese'. He declared that the Indian Army was determined to fight the Chinese to the last man.{URL23}

In its jingoism, the press lapped up the comment. Wrote the Statesman: "Mr Nehru…has told the country…that the armed forces have been ordered to throw the Chinese aggressors out of NEFA and that until Indian territory in that area is cleared of them there can be no talks with China." Even foreign newspapers reported it, some headlining the news to the effect that Nehru had declared war on China. The 'New York Herald Tribune' headed its editorial 'Nehru declared war on China'. The Chinese People's Daily also reported it, advising Nehru to "pull back from the brink of the precipice, and don't use the lives of Indian troops as stakes in your gamble."{Max/345}

The question is: Does one give operational orders publicly? It amounted to declaring war, and giving Chinese the excuse to retaliate. Wars are meant to be waged silently and anonymously. Mature nations and mature leaders are not expected to indulge in empty bluffs—there was no worth-while plan to either evict the Chinese, or to resist them if they attacked!!

With the AHQ dumbfounded at Nehru's surprise "throw out" orders, General Thapar rushed to the Defence Minister Krishna Menon and pointed out the orders were contrary to what was mutually agreed: not to attack or engage the Chinese! Responded Menon, unconcerned: "This is a political statement. It means action can be taken in ten days or a hundred days or a thousand days."{DD/363}

Commented Mao: "Since Nehru sticks his head out and insists on us fighting him, for us not to fight with him would not be proper. Courtesy emphasises reciprocity."

Responded Zhou Enlai: "We don't want a war with India. We have always strove in the direction of avoiding war. We wanted India to be like Nepal, Burma or Mongolia, i.e. solve border problems with them in a friendly fashion. But Nehru has closed all roads. This leaves us only with war. As I see it, to fight a bit would have advantages. It would cause some people to understand things more clearly."

Mao agreed: "Right! If someone does not attack me, I won't attack him. If someone attacks me, I will certainly attack him." {Arpi/479}

Mao directed: "First, the PLA had to secure a victory and knock Nehru to the negotiating table; and second, Chinese forces had to be restrained and principled." {Arpi/481}

#### THE DEBACLE

Alarmed by the Indian massing of troops in Dhola and the Indian attempts at Yumtsola on 10 October 1962 thanks to General BM Kaul, or, taking that as an excuse, Chinese overran Dhola on 20 October 1962 heralding the 1962-war. Kaul has to be blamed for it. Having seen the situation first-hand, General Kaul, as a responsible professional, should have put his foot down on India's Forward Policy misadventure to save the Indian army from the sure debacle it was staring at.

This is from the book, 'Himalayan Blunder', by Brigadier JP Dalvi, an eyewitness, and an actual participant in the 1962-war:

"At 5 on the morning of 20th October 1962 massed Chinese artillery opened up a heavy concentration on the weak Indian garrison, in a narrow sector of the Namka Chu Valley... Massive infantry assaults followed, and within three hours the unequal contest was over. The route to the plains of Assam lay wide open. The Chinese exploited their initial successes and advanced 160 miles into Indian territory... reaching the Brahmaputra Valley by 20th November. They swept aside the so-called impregnable defences of Sela Pass; Bomdilla was literally overrun; the monastery town of Towang fell without a fight. India's panicky reaction included the scrambling of ill-equipped, ill-trained for mountain warfare and unacclimatised military formations... The Chinese were amazed at this..."{JPD/1}

President Dr Radhakrishnan was so aghast that when someone told him of a rumour that General BM Kaul had been taken prisoner by the Chinese, he commented, "It is, unfortunately, untrue."{Max/410}

#### NEHRU ADMITS HIS BLUNDER

Wrote S Gopal, Nehru's official biographer: "Things went so wrong that had they not happened it would have been difficult to believe them."

*This is what Nehru himself admitted* :

"We were getting out of touch with reality in the modern world and we were living in an artificial atmosphere of our creation..."."{Zak/149}

"We feel India has been ill-repaid for her diplomatic friendliness toward Peking... Difficult to say the Chinese have deliberately deceived us... We may have deceived ourselves..."{AS/38}

CRIMINAL NEGLECT OF DEFENCE & EXTERNAL SECURITY

*The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.* —Sun Tzu, 'Art of War'

For a country that had been under the foreign domination for about a millennium, first under the Muslim invaders, and then under the British, it was expected that its own Indian rulers would give top priority to its external security after independence in 1947.

But, did that happen? No. Nehru and the Congress, brought up on the lethal dose of non-violence, pacifism and Gandhism, substituted wishful thinking for realpolitik, and negligently put India's external security requirements on the back-burner. (Please also check Blunder#16)

Nehru seemed to be clueless, even irresponsible, in not realising what it took for the country of the size of India, with its many inherited problems, to be able to defend itself adequately and deter others from any designs over it. On one hand, Nehru failed to settle border-issue with China, and on the other, he did precious little to militarily secure the borders we claimed ours. Nehru and his Defence Minister Krishna Menon ignored the persistent demands for military upgradation.

Wrote SK Verma in "1962: The War That Wasn't":

"With Bose's exit and Sardar Patel's death in 1950, there was no one who could provide the necessary inspiration for the reconstruction of an army (that had so far served British interests) into an integrated military instrument that could identify potential threats and tackle them militarily. Nehru, unlike Bose and Patel, veered away from building military power."{SKV/L-646}

Jaswant Singh wrote that "independent India simply abandoned the centrality of strategic culture as the first ingredient of vigorous and bold national policies."{JS2}

The seeds of India's disgraceful debacle in 1962 India-China War were sown soon after Independence by none other than Nehru himself, as would be shockingly obvious from the following incident. Shortly after

independence, the first Army Chief of independent India Lt General Sir Robert Lockhart (first army chiefs of India and Pakistan were British then!), as per the standard procedure, took a strategic defence plan for India to Nehru, seeking a Government directive in the matter. Unbelievably, Lockhart returned shell-shocked at Nehru's response:

"The PM took one look at my paper and blew his top. 'Rubbish! Total rubbish! We don't need a defence plan. Our policy is ahimsa [nonviolence]. We foresee no military threats. Scrap the army! The police are good enough to meet our security needs', shouted Nehru."{URL32}

Nehru actually went ahead and reduced the army strength by about 50,000 troops after independence despite the looming threat in Kashmir, and the Chinese entry into Tibet.{URL33}

Noted MO Mathai in the context of Khrushchev-Bulganin visit to India: "Several times Khrushchev emphasised the need for a first-class aircraft industry for a large country like India and volunteered to send some of Soviet Union's best experts in the field. Somehow it did not register with Nehru and no follow-up action was taken. It was only after the Chinese invasion that we woke up to the grim realities and secured Soviet collaboration in the production of modern military aircraft." {Mac2/4541}

Wrote RNP Singh in 'Nehru: A Troubled Legacy':

"Nehru took the matter of defence so lightly that in an answer to a question on Indian defence against a potential aggressor, he asserted that the nation had the spirit to defend itself by lathis [sticks] and stones if need be; 'Therefore, I am not afraid of anybody invading India from any quarter.' While delivering a speech in Parliament, Nehru once advised in an idealistic manner, 'If you better your morale and determine not to surrender, nothing can conquer you.' Nehru… told a press conference: 'I think the proper way to consider defence is to begin to forget the military aspect.'"{RNPS/120}

Given such a mind-set, only God could have saved India in times of disaster. Unfortunately, God too abandoned India in the 1962 War. Perhaps God was cheesed off by the "rational", "scientific-minded", atheist-agnostic Nehru! Despite the "Glimpses of World History" and the "Discovery of India", Nehru failed to discover that India suffered slavery for well over a millennium on account of its weakness to defend itself. No wonder, he

neglected modernisation of the army, strengthening of defence, and pacts with powerful nations to deter enemies and ensure India's security.

General Thapar had submitted a note to the government in 1960 pointing out that the equipment that the Indian army had and their poor condition was no match to that of China and even Pakistan. Prior to the operations against China to get certain territories vacated, Thapar had impressed upon Nehru that the Indian army was unprepared and ill-equipped for the task it was being asked to undertake. He even got Nehru to cross-check these stark realities from some of his senior staff. Yet, Nehru persisted, saying China would not retaliate! General Thapar told Kuldip Nayar on 29 July 1970, as stated by Nayar in his book 'Beyond the Lines': "Looking back, I think I should have submitted my resignation at that time. I might have saved my country from the humiliation of defeat."{KN}

Nehru's government indifferent approach to defence rested on the presumption that 'China would not attack' India. Wrote Durga Das:

"If [Krishna] Menon was guilty of hugging the illusion [that 'China would not attack'], so was Nehru, perhaps to a greater degree. He openly ticked off General Thimayya, Chief of Army Staff, at a Governor's Conference months earlier for even suggesting the possibility of an attack by China. Many others in the cabinet were not innocent. Either through ignorance or fear of going contrary to the Prime Minister [that was Nehruvian democracy, FoE, and quality of Cabinet System of Government for you!], they endorsed his complacent attitude."{DD/361}

General Thapar, the Chief of Army Staff, had requested for urgent additional funding to make good the gross deficiencies in armaments in July 1962, that happened to be about three months before the actual war. When the request was referred to Nehru, he shot it down saying China would not resort to force.{DD/362}

The army had made it sufficiently clear to Nehru and Menon that being out-gunned, out-tanked, and out-manned by the Chinese, they wouldn't be able to hold against them. Yet, the wise politicians persisted with their harebrained 'Forward Policy' (Blunder#36).

Earlier, the India's army chief KS Thimayya had repeatedly raised the issue of army's gross weaknesses in defending itself from China. Frustrated at his failure to get the needful done despite his entreaties to Krishna Menon and Nehru, this is what he told his fellow army-men in his farewell speech

upon retirement in 1961: "I hope I am not leaving you as cannon fodder for the Chinese. God bless you all!"

Thimayya had earlier remarked: "I cannot, even as a soldier, envisage India taking on China in an open conflict on its own. China's present strength in man-power, equipment and aircraft exceeds our resources a hundredfold with the full support of the USSR and we could never hope to match China in the foreseeable future. It must be left to the politicians and diplomats to ensure our security."{Arpi/473-4}

Commented Brig. Dalvi:{JPD/2}

"There was no overall political objective; no National Policy; no grand strategy and total unreadiness for military operations in the awesome Himalayan mountains, against a first-class land power... We did not study the pattern of weapons and communications equipments that we may require. Army Schools of Instruction were oriented towards open warfare. There was little emphasis on mountain warfare despite the Army's deployment in Kashmir from 1947... The Army was forgotten; its equipment allowed to become obsolete, certainly obsolescent; and its training academic and outdated. We merely tried to maintain what we had inherited in 1947...The political assumptions of our defence policies were invalid and dangerous..."

"In October 1962 Indians were shocked beyond words to discover that we had no modern rifle, although we were supposed to be ready to 'manufacture' an aircraft; and had the know-how to make an atombomb... Assam Rifles posts [under the forward policy] were deployed non-tactically and they were ill-armed and even worse equipped that the Regular Army. At best, they could only function as border check-posts and yet their task was 'to fight to the last man and the last round'...There were no inter-communication facilities between Assam Rifles' posts and the nearest Army sub-unit...The standard explanation was that there was a general shortage of wireless sets in the country. The Assam Rifles was a separate private army of the External Affairs Ministry. And who would dare bell the cat about the extraordinary command system?"{JPD/2}

Reportedly, at a meeting of the Defence Council in September 1962 [a month before the Chinese attack], while the Army Commander in Ladakh had stated, "If China attacks massively, we shall be annihilated," the head

of the Eastern Command had said, "If China decides to come down in a big way, we are in no position to hold it anywhere in NEFA."

Although, despite severe handicaps, Indian soldiers did their very best, the fact remains that it was a pathetically ill-prepared, ill-fed, ill-clothed, illsupplied, and ill-armed Indian Army—exposed to the elements, cold and hungry—that was forced into the misadventure, and it had to pay a very heavy price. For a relatively minor operation against the Portuguese in Goa in 1961, "one battalion was short of 400 pair of footwear and went into the battle in PT shoes,' as narrated by General BM Kaul.

### NEHRU'S WILD CLAIM (BLUFF?)!

Despite the above facts, Nehru stated (bluffed?) in the Parliament:

"I can tell this House that at no time since our independence, and of course before it, were our defence forces in better condition, in finer fettle...than they are today. I am not boasting about them or comparing them with any other country's, but I am quite confident that our defence forces are well capable of looking after our country."{Max/132}

## *Blunder–38 :*

#### POLITICISATION OF THE ARMY

Politicisation of the army high command was one of the reasons India performed miserably in the India-China War. Instead of heeding sound military advice, Nehru and Menon had put in place submissive officers at the top in the military, who would carry out their orders. Krishna Menon ill-treated people. He was offensive to the top-brass of the military. He antagonised many through his acerbic comments, sarcasm and supercilious behaviour. He had publicly humiliated top brass of the army. Eventually, some of their chosen submissive officers contributed to the humiliation of India.

General Verma had dared to write to the higher authorities the facts of poor operational readiness. He was asked to withdraw his letter. He refused and wanted the letter to be put on record. That honest, forthright and very capable officer was victimised—ultimately he resigned. Wrote Inder Malhotra:

"To cap it all, it was Menon's penchant to play favourites that was responsible for the disaster of Lt.-General B.M. Kaul, with hardly any

experience of combat, being appointed the commander in the battlefield and retaining that position even when he was lying ill in Delhi."{IM1}

It was the same Nehru protégé General BM Kaul who, to please Nehru, took forward the 'forward-policy', was responsible for the 'Dhola' disaster, and landed India in a soup. BM Kaul had replaced General Umrao Singh, an able, upright professional, who had been removed for not falling in line with what the political leadership (Nehru and Menon) wanted—he had objected to the reckless putting up of forward posts. Having undertaken to do what Umrao Singh had hang-ups about, Kaul could not very well turn around and express difficulties. Someone who would play the politicians' game was urgently needed and Kaul had willingly stepped into that role.

Wrote GS Bhargava in his book 'The Battle of NEFA':

"...a new class of Army Officer who could collude with politicians to land the country in straights in which it found itself in September-October 1962. Since qualities of heart and head ceased to be a passport to promotion for military officers...the more ambitious among them started currying favour with the politicians."{GSB}

## *Blunder–39 :*

#### ANTI ARMED-FORCES

It may sound odd, but Nehru was so obsessed about continuing in power, and so unnecessarily and irrationally concerned of the possibility of the army coup, that he went to insane level of check-mating that possibility even to the extent of harming the Indian defences, Indian external security, and the morale of the Army.

The top bureaucracy, noticing Nehru's suspicion for and bias against the army, cleverly manoeuvred a note declaring the Armed Forces Headquarters as the "attached" office of the Defence Ministry. That ensured ascendency for the top babu of the Defence Ministry—the Defence Secretary—over the army chief. The post of Commander-in-Chief, the main advisor on military matters, was abolished. That role was given to the President of India—the President became formally the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces! The real motive was to remove the possibility of the Army Commander-in-Chief ever challenging the civilian authority. When you had adopted the complete British political system, bureaucratic system and the army system

lock, stock, and barrel, and when there had been no occasion in the preindependence period either in India or Britain when the Commander-in-Chief had booted out the civilian authority, why that uncalled for concern? The British-Indian army under the British, during the pre-independence days, though under the political control of the Governor General, enjoyed a large degree of autonomy, and was not subservient to the bureaucracy. That changed post-independence.

Rather than recognising the tremendous contribution of the Indian Armed Forces in the First and the Second World War, and giving them pride of place, the political class and the bureaucratic class conspired to downgrade the position of the Military top brass, by instituting various changes in the pecking order, reporting channels, and the constitution of the committees.

The place next in stateliness and grandeur to the Viceroy palace was the residence of the British Commander-in-Chief, then called Flagstaff House. That house should have been allocated to Field Marshal KM Cariappa. But, Nehru, leaving his spacious York Road residence, promptly allocated it to himself—such were the Gandhian values of simplicity imbibed by him. Flagstaff House was later renamed as Teen Murti Bhavan*.*

Changes were done where the bureaucrats began to be ranked higher than the senior military officers. With respect to the top IAS babus, the three Service Chiefs have been downgraded. They interact with the Defence Secretary who is the interface between the Armed Forces and the Union Cabinet. Matters related to Defence Production and Defence Purchases also came principally under the bureaucrats in the Defence Ministry (though army men were represented in committees). Whichever domain, department, sector the babus, the IAS stepped in that area went to dogs. Babus, who knew next to nothing on the defence matters, started dictating terms and making money. Politicisation and favouritism became the order of the day, and professionalism went for a toss. Instead of exercising 'political control' over the military, what is exercised in practice is 'bureaucratic control'. Defence Secretary is the boss and the Service Chiefs have a subservient role, with the military isolated from real decisionmaking! Such was the Nehruvian hubris that side-lining the militaryseniors, even purely military matters tended to be decided by Nehru, Krishna Menon, other politicians, and bureaucrats—like the hare-brained "Forward Policy" (Blunder#36): even the post-facto inputs of the Indian

army on its military and strategic implications were ignored by Nehru-Menon.

Worst was keeping the military weak, lest they ever challenge the civilian authority. Military remained grossly under-funded. It continued with the obsolete Second World War equipments. During the Nehruvian times the Defence Ministry had very low importance. Senior ministers shunned it, as it was considered not an important enough portfolio for a senior politician!

## LETHARGIC INTELLIGENCE MACHINERY & NO PLANNING

Despite the fact of unsettled borders, skirmishes as far back as 1959, and the real possibility of war, there was grossly inadequate defence preparation and no contingency plan in place. Even assuming there had actually been no war, common sense dictated that allowing for its possibility, alternate plans, accounting for all contingencies, should have been in place. That also required intelligence inputs on the Chinese preparedness, their strategy and their weaknesses and strengths. While it seems China had sufficient knowledge on India on all aspects relevant to winning war against it through its network of agents; India's intelligence was woefully poor. Here are glaring examples.

China declared unilateral ceasefire on 21 November 1962. However, even such an important announcement of China became known to the government belatedly. Wrote Kuldip Nayar:

"...A cavalcade of cars moved to the prime minister's residence. Nehru had just woken up and was totally unaware of the Chinese offer. This was typical of our intelligence agencies and of the functioning of the government. Though the statement on the ceasefire had reached newspaper offices just before midnight, the government was unaware of it. Even the official spokesman whom the pressman awoke for a reaction expressed ignorance. What a way to fight a war, I thought."{KN}

BG Verghese wrote in "The War We Lost":

"Around midnight, a transistor with one of our colleagues crackled to life as Peking Radio announced a unilateral ceasefire and pull back to the pre-October 'line of actual control'...Next morning, all the world carried

the news, but AIR still had brave jawans gamely fighting the enemy as none had had the gumption to awaken Nehru and take his orders as the news was too big to handle otherwise! Indeed, during the preceding days, everyone from general to jawan to officials and the media was tuned into Radio Peking to find out what was going on in our own country."{URL19}

The above are only illustrative examples. When on critical matters you had no intelligence or prior information, what to speak of other matters. The life of our brave jawans came cheap. Just dump them in the war without any proper protective gear or arms, and without any intelligence on the enemy positions and preparation! With the strategic thinking and strategic planning itself being absent, where was the question of intelligence to assist those processes.

## *Blunder–41 :*

#### SUPPRESSING TRUTH

People feel shocked when they learn of the background and the details of the India-China War because under the cover of "national security interests" things have been hidden away from the public, despite such a long lapse of time. Wrote Brigadier JP Dalvi:

"The people of India want to know the truth but have been denied it on the dubious ground of national security. The result has been an unhealthy amalgam of innuendo, mythology, conjecture, outright calumny and sustained efforts to confuse and conceal the truth. Even the truncated NEFA Enquiry [Henderson-Brooks Report] has been withheld except for a few paraphrased extracts read out to the Lok Sabha on 2 nd September 1963. For some undisclosed reason, I was not asked to give evidence [despite being on the frontline during the war] before this body nor (to the best of my knowledge) were my repatriated Commanding Officers [Dalvi and others were taken prisoner by the Chinese and released in 1963]."{JPD/xv}

Like a dictator Nehru kept the whole thing under wraps. Wrote Neville Maxwell: "…This was true of the handling of the boundary question [with China] which was kept away not only from the Cabinet and its Foreign Affairs and Defence Committees, but also from Parliament until armed clashes made it impossible to suppress."(Max}

No democratic country remains so secretive. Both the UK and the USA, as also other democratic countries, make all official documents available after a lapse of certain years, as per their law, so that historians, academics, researchers, experts, leaders and others can study them. This helps writing of correct history, drawing proper conclusions, and learning lessons for the future. But, in India, the leaders and the bureaucrats are ever afraid of their incompetence and dishonesty being exposed. They are bothered about their present and their survival, the future of the country is not their business. You ignore history and its lessons at your own peril and hence, to draw useful lessons for future from the debacle, it is necessary to raise uncomfortable questions:

"What was the nature of the border dispute? Why the issue was not resolved through talks? Why didn't India settle it in 1954 itself at the time of signing the Panchsheel? Was Indian position justified? Did Chinese arguments have substance? Why did India change its maps in 1954—on what grounds? Were there solid grounds for India to be so adamant on its stand? Why was the Chinese offer of a swap-deal on McMahon Line and Aksai Chin not accepted? Why was the forward policy adopted? Why the Indian defence preparedness was so poor? Had there been politicisation of the army? Why was the Indian performance in the war so pathetic? What should be India's stand going forward? How to resolve the dispute? How to strengthen India's defence?..."

Accountability should have been established and those responsible should have got their just deserts. The findings of the enquiry should have been made public, along with a road-map for the future. That's democracy!

The India-China war of 1962 was indeed independent India's most traumatic and worst-ever external security failure. Any democratic country, worth its salt, would have instituted a detailed enquiry into all aspects of the debacle. But, what happened in practice? Nothing! The government was brazen enough not to set up a comprehensive enquiry. Why let their own mistakes be found? Why punish themselves? Why be made to resign? Why vacate your positions? People don't deserve to know! It was an autocratic democracy. Don't disclose—cite "national interest". Although, it was not national interest, but pure self-interest, that drove the decision. Sweep under carpet whatever is unpalatable. Just put all the blame on the Chinese and on a few scapegoats.

The above would be obvious from the following. During the lull in the war—24 Oct–13 Nov 1962—this is what Nehru said in the Rajya Sabha on 9 November 1962: "People have been shocked, all of us have been shocked, by the events that occurred from October 20 onwards, especially of the first few days, and the reverses we suffered. So I hope there will be an inquiry so as to find out what mistakes or errors were committed and who were responsible for them." During the lull period India was making its preparations and those in power in Delhi were sure India would give a befitting reply to the Chinese. But, the subsequent war of 14-20 November 1962 proved even more disastrous. Sensing its consequence upon him, Nehru conveniently forgot about the enquiry.

Although no enquiry was set up by the Indian Cabinet or the Government, the new Chief of Army Staff, General Chaudhuri, did set up an Operations Review Committee headed by Lieutenant-General TB Henderson-Brooks, aka HB, of the Indian army—an Australian-born, second-generation English expatriate who had opted to be an Indian, rather than a British, citizen in the 1930s—with Brigadier Premendra Singh Bhagat, Victoria Cross, then commandant of the Indian Military Academy, as a member.

However, the terms of reference of the Committee were never published; it had no power to examine witnesses or call for documents; and it had no proper legal authority. The purpose was to ensure it didn't morph into a comprehensive fact-finding mission that could embarrass the government. Reportedly, its terms of reference were very restrictive confined perhaps to only the 4 Corps' operations. However, going by the fact that the report, referred to as the Henderson-Brooks Report or Henderson-Brooks/Bhagat Report or HB/B Report (submitted in April 1963) of even such a handicapped Committee has been kept classified and top secret even till today signifies that the Committee went beyond its limited terms of reference, did some very good work and managed to nail the root causes, which the powers that be wanted to remain hidden. Perhaps, had the HB report been made public, Nehru would have had to resign. Wrote Kuldip Nayar in 'Beyond the Lines'{KN} :

"...in September 1970, [General] Thapar [who headed the army at the time of the war] approached Indira Gandhi...to allow him to see the [HB] report... She did not however concede the request...When I was a Rajya Sabha member from 1996, I wanted the report to be made public. The

government refused to do so 'in public interest'. My hunch was that the report had so severely criticized Nehru that the government, even headed by the BJP, did not want to face the public anger that would have been generated... I used the RTI facilities in 2008 when I wanted access to the Henderson Brooks inquiry report...[but didn't succeed]..."{KN}

As per the Hindustan Times report titled 'Incorrect maps given to China led to 1962 war' of 22 October 2012:

"...India presented contradictory maps on the McMahon Line to China in the fifties and in 1960-61, which ultimately led to the war with China in 1962. This revelation was made by Wajahat Habibullah, former chief information commissioner (CIC), perhaps the only civilian besides defence secretaries to have officially accessed the top secret Henderson Brookes-Bhagat report. 'We had given maps with serious contradictions on the layout of the McMahon Line to China. This led the Chinese to believe that one of the pickets being controlled by our forces in the Northeast was theirs—according to one of the maps given to them by us,' said Habibullah, declining to name the picket along the Arunachal Pradesh border with China...Accordingly, on October 20, 1962, the Chinese army crossed over to occupy the border picket, leading to open hostilities...Habibullah got the go-ahead to access to the report after journalist Kuldip Nayar's appeal under the RTI Act in 2005 [or, was it 2008?] to get a copy of the report."{URL63}

Wrote Claude Arpi:

"Unfortunately, historians and researchers have never been allowed access to original materials to write about Nehru's leadership during the troubled years after Independence. It is tragic that the famous 'Nehru Papers' are jealously locked away in the Nehru Memorial Library. They are, in fact, the property of his family! I find it even more regrettable that during its six years in power, the NDA government, often accused of trying to rewrite history, did not take any action to rectify this anomaly. Possibly they were not interested in recent history! ...As a result, today history lovers and serious researchers have only the 31 volumes published so far of the Selected Works of Jawaharlal Nehru (covering the period 1946 to 1955) to fall back on. This could be considered a partial declassification of the Nehru Papers, except for the fact that the editing has always been undertaken by Nehruvian historians, making at times the selection tainted. The other problem is that these volumes cover only the

writings (or sayings) of Nehru; notes or letters of other officials or dignitaries which triggered Nehru's answers are only briefly and unsatisfactorily resumed in footnotes."{Arpi2}

#### HIMALAYAN BLUNDERS, BUT NO ACCOUNTABILITY

Such was the economy practised in sharing information with the public, the media, and even the parliament, and such was the economy with truth in Nehru's democratic India that the blame for debacle in the India-China War came not on Nehru, the principal person responsible, but on Menon. Such was the ignorance of the opposition that Kriplani and others asked Nehru to take over the defence portfolio from Menon! The poor fellows had no idea that the disaster both in the foreign policy and in the defence was actually thanks to Nehru. Menon was only a protégé of Nehru, did his bidding, and became Defence Minister only in 1957.

Krishna Menon was reluctantly made the scapegoat. COAS Thapar resigned. BM Kaul resigned. But, not Nehru. Wrote Brigadier JP Dalvi in his book 'Himalayan Blunder':

"When the inevitable disaster came Nehru did not even have grace or courage to admit his errors or seek a fresh mandate from the people. He did not even go through the motion of resigning; he merely presented his trusted colleagues and military appointees as sacrificial offerings...{JPD/249}

"Instead of gracefully accepting responsibility for erroneous policies, the guilty men sought alibis and scapegoats. In any developed democracy the Government would have been replaced, instead of being allowed to continue in office and sit in judgement on their subordinates...{JPD/161}

"We must also learn that a democracy has no room for proven failures. This is not a matter of sentiment. Mr Chamberlain was removed after Hitler invaded France in May 1940 with Cromwell's classic plea, 'For God's sake, go'. Mr Anthony Eden was forced out of office after the disastrous Suez adventure of 1956..."{JPD/161}

Not only that, Nehru was not even willing to remove the Defence Minister Krishna Menon. Nehru told Yashwant Rao Chavan who had come to Delhi to attend a meeting of the Chief Ministers: "You see, they want Menon's blood. If I agree, tomorrow they will ask for my blood."{DD/364}

Finding it difficult to resist pressure, Nehru played his old game of a threat of his own resignation. Nehru had threatened to resign on several earlier occasions to have his way safe in the knowledge that people would back off. But, not this time. When he found that the trick won't work and he himself would have to go, he quickly backed off and asked Menon to resign. Meanwhile Indira Gandhi had approached Vice-President Zakir Hussain to persuade her father to drop Menon, as that was the only way to appease the enraged public and the media. Nehru actually remonstrated with those who criticised him, and later even took revenge against some! For example, Dharampal, a highly regarded thinker-scholar and author who had addressed an open letter to Nehru critical of the humiliating 1962-war debacle was jailed by Nehru (Blunder#97).

Here is Israel and Golda Meir's example, in sharp contrast to that of India and Nehru's:

After its decisive victory against the joint Egypt-Syria-Jordan-Iraq army in 1967 in the Six-Day War, following its victories in 1948 at the time of its birth, and later, Israel was a little laid back and unprepared, thinking Arabs wouldn't dare attack again. Also because Israel had nuclear weapons by then to deter the Arabs. The attack of 1973 therefore came as a surprise to it. In 1973, Yom Kipper, the holiest day of the year for the Jews, fell on 6 October. It is on that day when Israel and the Jews the world over were busy observing Yom Kipper that the Egyptian and the Syrian armies launched a surprise attack against Israel in the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights respectively. Still, after the initial setbacks and panic, it rose to the challenge, and repelled the combined attack, emerging triumphant. The war came to be known as the Yom Kipper War.

Golda Meir was the president then. Even though Israel's ultimate victory was spectacular and decisive, they immediately instituted an enquiry to fix responsibility for the initial setbacks and the panic reaction, and the lapses that led to the attack coming as a surprise. The preliminary report took just a few months and was released on April 2, 1974—it actually named names of those responsible. Several top-ranking staff were asked to resign. Golda Meir was not named, but taking overall responsibility, she resigned on April 10, 1974—after mere eight days of release of the report, which was only a preliminary report! This, even though Israel,

under Golda Meir, had actually won the war decisively and turned the tables on the Arab countries that had attacked them!

Contrast the above with Nehru and India. Even though India lost pathetically in the 1962 India-China War, Nehru government instituted no enquiry; and Nehru did not even make a gesture of an offer to resign. What was the alibi offered to the gullible public? The nation was told that the borders were well-settled, and that the unprovoked attack from China was what the innocent India got for doing all the good to China. Even Rajaji, otherwise in opposition to Nehru by then, blamed it on the treachery of the Chinese. Perhaps, at that time Rajaji did not know all the facts. You do a Himalayan blunder, but you receive sympathy—Nehru, the poor chap, was stabbed in the back by the Chinese! How publicised misinformation can turn the scales.

Everyone remembers a popular song of those times penned by poet Pradeep and sung by Lata Mangeshkar. It went like this: "*Aai mere watan ke logo, jara aankh me bhar lo paani, jo shaheed hue hai unki, jara yaad karo kurbani.* .." The song is invariably played on August 15 every year. Lata told in an interview when she had sung that song in Nehru's presence, Nehru had wept! So sensitive was he!! Again, additional praise. But, who was responsible for his own tears and tears in the eyes of crores of Indians, in the first place? Had sensible policies been followed, this huge tragedy that befell the nation, and the consequent tears, could have been avoided.

Goa, Daman and Diu, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli—collectively known as the Estado da Índia—continued to remain occupied by Portugal after independence. They covered an area of about 4,000 sq km, and a population of about 6.4 lakh comprising about 61% Hindus, 37% Christians, and 2% Muslims. India finally carried out air, sea and land strikes under the armedaction code-named 'Operation Vijay', and liberated all the Portugueseoccupied Indian territories in December 1961, after a two-day operation. Dadra and Nagar Haveli were liberated earlier in 1954. Why should it have taken 14 long years after the Indian independence to throw out the Portuguese in 1961? Couldn't Nehru get a small territory vacated?

During a long discussion on Goa in the Foreign Affairs Committee in 1950, Sardar Patel kept to himself listening to the various tame alternatives, then suddenly said at the end, "Shall we go in? It is two hours' work!" Patel was very keen to fulfil the assurance given to the Goa Congress in his letter of 14 May 1946 promising freedom from foreign domination. He was all for using force to settle the matter quickly. But, Nehru was much too soft to take any effective steps. Patel felt exasperated.{BK/521}

Wrote Durga Das: "Gandhi advised the people [Indians] of the French and Portuguese possessions in India not to revolt against their overlords on 15th August but to trust Nehru to do for his kith and kin what he was doing to assist the Indonesians to become free. Indirectly, Gandhi was voicing the fact that he differed from Patel's view on Goa and Pondicherry and other foreign enclaves and agreed with Nehru's that the question of their liberation could wait for some time."{DD/250}

If Sardar Patel's advice had been heeded, Goa would have been part of the Indian Union by 1948 itself. However, with pacifists like Nehru and Gandhi desired action could always wait, and self-deluding talks substituted for decision and action. Left to Gandhi and Nehru, and had Patel not been on the scene, while Hyderabad and Junagadh would have been another Kashmir or Pakistan; there would have been dozens of independent Princely States sucking up to Britain or Pakistan, and becoming permanent headaches!

Commented Sita Ram Goel then, prior to Goa's annexation:

"And the fact that Pandit Nehru has not ordered the Indian Army to march into Goa nor amalgamated the French possessions into the Indian Union without further reference to France, is also a positive proof that he is not an Indian patriot. I am convinced that not a fly will flutter in France if the French possessions are integrated forthwith into India. Portugal will most probably put up a fight over Goa. But, again, I am sure that no other Western nation will show her much sympathy or give her any support. Goa under the Portuguese and the French possessions without a de jure transfer are only convenient excuses for Pandit Nehru in his communist game of perverting Indian nationalism and setting it up against the Western camp. If Goa and the French possessions are taken by India, he will not know how to harangue against the North Atlantic Alliance, day in and day out."{SRG2/170}

#### NEHRU'S NO TO NUCLEAR ARMS

The then US president John F Kennedy was an admirer of Indian democracy, and when he learnt that China was on its way to detonate a nuclear device, he wanted that it ought to be a democratic country like India, and not communist China, which should have nuclear capability. The Kennedy administration was ready to help India out with nuclear deterrence. But, Nehru rejected the offer.

Currently, India has been canvassing support from various countries to become a member of Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)—in vain, so far. Had Nehru gone along with Kennedy's advice, India would have detonated a nuclear device well before China. Had that happened, not only would India have been a member of the NSG long, long ago, but China would not have dared to attack India in 1962, nor would Pakistan have taken liberties to attack India in 1965.

Former foreign secretary Rasgotra disclosed:

"…Kennedy's hand-written letter was accompanied by a technical note from the chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, setting out the assistance his organisation would provide to Indian atomic scientists to detonate an American device from atop a tower in Rajasthan desert, the release said... In the letter, Kennedy had said he and the American establishment were aware of Nehru's strong views against nuclear tests and nuclear weapons, but emphasised the political and security threat China's test would spell for Nehru's government and India's security, it said, adding the American leader's letter emphasised that 'nothing is more important than national security.'"{URL49}

Gandhian 'Ahimsa' had not only totally vitiated free India's approach to retaining its own freedom by strengthening its defence and external security; but had also provided excuses to pacifists like Nehru to not fulfil their basic responsibility as prime minister of protecting India, under the garb of the hypocrisy of high moral principles, and being flag-bearers of world-peace. Nehru failed to grasp the deterrence value of nuclear weapons. What is surprising is what were his cabinet colleagues and other leaders of the ruling and the opposition parties doing? Were they mere mute and

spineless witnesses to whatever the autocratic and undemocratic Nehru chose to do?

#### NO SETTLEMENT WITH PAKISTAN

Nehru failed to reach an accommodation with Pakistan during his life time, making our western and north western borders sensitive, costing us heavy to secure them. The crux of the Indo-Pak dispute was Kashmir; and Pakistan was unwilling for settlement and for no-war pact till the Kashmir issue was resolved. Kashmir would have been a non-issue had Nehru allowed Sardar Patel to handle it; or had Gandhi not made Nehru the first PM. It was Nehru's responsibility to resolve the issues he had created. Nehru unfortunately expired leaving both the issues—Kashmir and Indo-Pak settlement—unsolved.

The India-Pakistan Indus Water Treaty (IWT) of 1960 on sharing of waters from the six Indus-system rivers was an unprecedented (by any nation) generous "give away" (like the India-China Panchsheel agreement of 1954: Blunder#34) by Nehru to Pakistan at the cost of J&K and Punjab (Blunder#50), with no reciprocal "take". It didn't occur to Nehru to make it conditional upon Pakistan settling on J&K and other matters to ensure secure western and north western borders.

Intended to palliate India's alarm at Pakistan's entry into SEATO in 1958, General Ayub Khan proposed security alliance/pact with India to Nehru. Nehru summarily and scornfully rejected the proposal remarking security alliance "against whom?"

#### RESPONSIBLE FOR 1965-WAR TOO, IN A WAY

India's lack of pacts with powerful countries to back it up in case of external attacks (Nehruvian policy (fad) of "Non-Alignment" resulted in it being non-aligned with its own national security interests—Blunder#57), its poor showing in 1962-War, the fact of its continued dependence on outdated armaments of World War-II vintage, the exposure of its gross deficiency in modern military hardware, and little efforts even post 1962war to strengthen itself, prompted Pakistan to take advantage of the situation and attempt to grab Kashmir militarily in 1965.

India and Nehru did not wake up even as Pakistan equipped itself with first-class, modern military hardware from the USA, following its pact with the anti-communist Western Bloc. Shastri was relatively a new entrant as PM, and he had hardly had time to come to grips with things crying for attention, let alone tackle the huge Nehru legacy of untackled problems. The blame for the fact that Pakistan dared to attack India on account of its known unpreparedness, therefore, rests squarely with Nehru. Further, as per the US advice, had India gone nuclear (Blunder#44), or had Nehru reached an honourable settlement with Pakistan (Blunder#45), Pakistan would not have dared to attack India.

INTERNATIONAL RECORD IN INSECURE BORDERS

Nehru's policies resulted in thousands of kilometres of all land boundaries of India, whether in the north or east or west or northeast or northwest, becoming sensitive and insecure, requiring massive investments to protect them. What is noteworthy is that there were enough opportunities to peacefully settle the boundaries with China in the 1950s and early 1960s, and with Pakistan too, yet most irresponsibly Nehru failed to encash on them (Blunder#35,45).

Thanks to Gandhi's choice for the first PM of India, India is the only country of its size in the world with such a long unsettled border with a giant neighbour, and disputes with another.

Rather than solving a plethora of severe problems crying for attention, the Nehruvian era added new problems, and not just added them, made them more difficult and almost insolvable, the most severe being securing the long borders.

Thanks to the Himalayas, the north from time immemorial has been the most secure natural boundary. Nehruvian policies managed to make them insecure!

Northeast has been made insecure thanks to gross misgovernance, corruption, and insurgency, and to Nehru turning a blind eye to adversely

changing demography—thanks to proselytization, and to Muslim migrations from East Pakistan/Bangladesh.
