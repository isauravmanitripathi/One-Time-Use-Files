# 8. EDUCATIONAL & CULTURAL MISMANAGEMENT

## *Blunder–79 :*

#### NEGLECT OF UNIVERSAL EDUCATION

Neglect of education, especially at the primary and the secondary level during the Nehruvian era sealed India's fate as a prosperous emerging nation and a genuine, enlightened democracy. Among the first things that the countries like Japan, South Korea and Singapore did to become prosperous was to focus on education—both mass education and higher education. Nehru knew only one formula for development: socialism and public sector—which took India to dogs.

Considering how backward the home constituencies of the Nehru-Gandhis have been, despite the fact that they have been representing them for decades. Universal literacy and an informed public were the two factors Nehru-Dynasty could not have survived; so it seems they let wide-spread illiteracy and grossly inadequate educational infrastructure prevail.

The education under Nehru became elitist. There was regrettable compartmentalisation into the HMTs (Hindi-Medium types) and the EMTs (English-Medium types), with EMTs cornering most facilities and opportunities. There were little efforts to make education universal. Policy restrictions and the bureaucratic-maze spread by the Nehruvians ensured peripheral role for the private sector in education, thus severely limiting the already limited educational sector further.

Wrote Atanu Dey: "The positive correlation between wealth and literacy suggests causation… Of all the stupidities that the government then (thanks to the incompetence of Nehru & his bunch of miserable minions), not ensuring that India becomes 100 percent literate within a decade stands out as the costliest… Did I say that Nehru was incompetent? Sorry, I meant Nehru was criminally incompetent."{URL35a}

#### IITS, IIMS, AIIMS, R&D, S&T: NOT THANKS TO NEHRU

Nehruvians flaunt establishment of IITs and IIMs during the time of Nehru. The question is whether just five IITs and a few IIMs were enough for a country of India's size. Shouldn't there have been several IITs and several IIMs in each state? Incidentally, among the persons who

conceptualised CSIR and IITs even before independence was Sir Ardeshir Dalal from the Viceroy's Executive Council (VEC). The idea was carried forward by, among others, Dr BC Roy, Sir JC Ghosh, Sir Jogendra Singh of the VEC, Sir Nalini Ranjan Sarkar, LS Chandrakant and Biman Sen.{URL73}

Extracts from an article in SundayGuradianLive.com{W.n16} :

"In reality, it was through the vision and effort of Arcot Ramaswami Mudaliar that the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research came into existence in 1940 and it was Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee who built it up… A number of laboratories were set up by Dr Mookerjee, including the National Physical Laboratory, National Chemical Laboratory, National Metallurgical Laboratory, Fuel Research Institute, Ceramics Research Institute, Central Leather Research Institute, and the Central Electro Chemical Research Institute…

"By the 1940s, India already had the infrastructure for supporting scientific activities and India's Hindu civilisation had generated many scientific ideas and scientists over thousands of years. Institutes like the Banaras Hindu University which was founded by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, the Indian Institute of Science, the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science which had been founded in 1876, the core of Indian Statistical Institute, and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, all predated Nehru's time in office, but Nehru and his supporters have taken credit for the creation of these establishments. Among the public sector units, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited had been set up by Walchand Hirachand as a private business and it supplied state-of-the-art aircraft to Britain for its war efforts, but it rapidly deteriorated after the Nehru government started managing it…

"The founding of the Indian Institutes of Technology and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences too had nothing to do with Jawaharlal Nehru. While the IITs had their genesis in the N.M. Sircar Committee report of 1945, Nehru's indifference towards setting up medical institutes was captured in an exchange between Dr Mookerjee and N.G. Ranga in the Constituent Assembly. When Dr Mookerjee mentioned that a committee under the chairmanship of Dr Arcot Lakshmanaswami Mudaliar had been set up to establish an All India Medical Institute, N.G. Ranga highlighted Nehru's statement opposing the All India Medical Institute in Delhi on the grounds that the housing problem had to be solved first…

"It was this flawed vision which made Nehru indifferent to the All India Council of Technical Education's recommendation to set up management institutes…

"Nehru's apathy towards science and his support for 'socialist' pseudoscience is best illustrated by his treatment of Srinivasa Sourirajan and other scientists. Nehru propped up his supporters and made them the key people, who ended up influencing the Indian scientific institutions over the next few decades. Soon, there were complaints of a class of 'science bourgeoisie' who were oppressive and squelched talent, resulting in an exodus of scientists leaving India, a problem that came to be labelled 'brain drain'…

"Nehru also opposed acquiring missiles and the atom bomb…"{W.n16}

#### MESSING UP THE LANGUAGE ISSUE

After considerable deliberations the Constituent Assembly agreed that the official language of the Union shall be Hindi in the Devanagari script; but for 15 years from the commencement of the Constitution, that is, from 26 January 1950, the English language shall continue to be used for all the official purposes of the Union—that is, till 25 January 1965. The Official Languages Act of 1963 stipulated that English "may" be used along with Hindi in official communications after 1965. That left it ambiguous. Was it optional? Lal Bahadur Shastri as prime minister stood by the decision to make Hindi official with effect from 26 January 1965, and all hell broke loose in the South. Ultimately, Shastri had to back out.

The question is not Hindi or English, the question is why the matter was allowed to drift for 15 years under Nehru? Why a dialogue was not established among all the stake-holders and why what would happen post 26 January 1965 not thrashed out many years in advance allowing for a smooth transition, or for maintenance of the status quo? If indeed all were not agreeable on Hindi, then it should have been announced well in advance that the status quo would continue till as long as all were not agreed.

Nehru's drift and lack of clarity eventually led to massive agitations and violence and bad blood among people, which were quite avoidable. Shastri

too should have been careful not to go along with a decision taken long ago that was not acceptable to a large section.

If it was thought that English is a useful global language, then, as a matter of policy, it should have been made compulsory for all from class-I itself. Government should have pumped in money to ensure there were facilities available in all schools to teach English, apart from the regional language and Hindi. Doing so would have ensured a level-playing field for all students. With all children knowing English, the "English Language Aristocracy" would have been dead. However, this was not done. The brown sahibs managed to create an "English Language Aristocracy" after independence. How to corner good positions, jobs and privileges? Make them conditional upon knowledge of English. Restrict English to chosen schools and colleges, and restrict access to those institutions to only the privileged.

This is not to say that the medium of instruction should have been English. It should have been in the mother tongue in the schools, and optionally also in English or Hindi—with no privileges attached to learning in English or Hindi. But, it should have been compulsory for all to learn English—and good English. That way, English would have been just a foreign language everyone knew. If English became a factor in getting jobs, like in IT or BPO or KPO, then with all students knowing it, it would not have given an edge to the less deserving.

A miniscule English-speaking elite, a miniscule set of Hindi diehards and a non-visionary, incompetent leadership messed up the language issue. A vast majority of people in the South knew neither Hindi nor English, so where was the question of their preferring either? Why should Hindi diehards have tried to impose Hindi? It is a democratic nation, and a consensus should have been evolved; and till that was ensured, nothing should have been done to force any language. If a period of 15 years was found insufficient, it should have been extended well in advance of its expiry, lest there be any uncertainty.

Further, why shouldn't an ancient nation like India have its own national language known to all for easy communication, without in anyway ignoring the regional languages or English or affecting the job-prospects? Who cares what language is so chosen? What is important is that there should have been at least one common language. It could have been Hindi or

Hindustani, with liberal borrowing of words from other regional languages and English; or it could have been simplified Sanskrit or Tamil or Telugu or Bengali or any other or a new hybrid language, with borrowings from all!

In sharp contrast to India, it is admirable what Israel did. Upon formation of Israel in 1948, many Jews scattered all over the world came over. They spoke different languages. To ensure a unifying language, many linguists, backed by the State, set about reviving Hebrew, Israel's ancient language, which had fallen in decrepitude. Now, all Israelis speak Hebrew. It has given them an identity, and has greatly helped unify Israel. Most also know English, as it is taught from the primary school itself.

Language Commission setup in 1955 examined the progress in Hindi to replace English as the union language by 26 January 1965 as provided in the constitution, reiterated the constitutional obligation, made various recommendations, but left the decision to the government. A Parliamentary Committee, with GB Pant (the then Home Minister) as the Chairman, was appointed in 1957 to scrutinize the commission's recommendations. Its unanimous (but for one dissent) recommendation was that Hindi should be the principal language from 26 January 1965, and English a subsidiary one, with no target date for the switch over. Pant sent the draft-report of the Parliamentary Committee to Nehru. Here are the extracts from Kuldip Nayar's 'Beyond the Lines' on what transpired:

"The use of the word 'subsidiary' for English infuriated Nehru, who argued that the word, subsidiary, meant English was the language of 'vassals'. [Various substitute words were suggested by Pant]... Nehru disagreed with Pant and worse, he was quite indignant and reportedly made some harsh comments. Finally, the word subsidiary was substituted by 'additional'. Pant told me, 'Mark my words, Hindi will not come to the country'. He was dejected. That very evening, Pant had his first heart attack…"{KN}

Actually, Nehru wanted to carry on with the language he was comfortable in, and it is doubtful if he really cared for things Indian or Indian languages or culture. What is noteworthy is that most of the freedom fighters, irrespective of the language-region they came from, favoured Hindi or Hindustani as a common link-language and national language. Yet, the matter was allowed to become controversial under the watch of Nehru after independence.

Lokmanya Tilak fervently advocated Hindi as the national language, holding the same as a vital concomitant of nationalism. Gandhi had praised Tilak for his discourse on Hindi as the national language at the Calcutta Congress. In London, Veer Savarkar had proposed the resolution on Swaraj not in English, but in what he called the "India's lingua franca"—Hindi. At the Ahmedabad Congress Session in December 1921, Gandhi had proposed three things: Hindi as India's lingua franca, tricolour as national flag, and khadi as the official wear for the Congress members. {BK/74}

Back in December 1925, at the Kanpur Session of the Congress presided by Ms Sarojini Naidu, Hindustani was recommended as the language for Congress Sessions.

Wrote Gandhi in Harijan of 9 July 1938:{CWMG/Vol-73/279-80}

"...The medium of a foreign language through which higher education has been imparted in India has caused incalculable intellectual and moral injury to the nation. We are too near our own times to judge the enormity of the damage done. And we who have received such education have both to be victims and judges—an almost impossible feat...

...Up to the age of 12 all the knowledge I gained was through Gujarati, my mother tongue. I knew then something of arithmetic, history and geography. Then I entered a high school. For the first three years the mother tongue was still the medium. But the schoolmaster's business was to drive English into the pupil's head. Therefore more than half of our time was given to learning English and mastering its arbitrary spelling and pronunciation. It was a painful discovery to have to learn a language that was not pronounced as it was written. It was a strange experience to have to learn the spelling by heart... The pillory began with the fourth year. Everything had to be learnt through English—geometry, algebra, chemistry, astronomy, history, geography. The tyranny of English was so great that even Sanskrit or Persian had to be learnt through English, not through the mother tongue. If any boy spoke in the class in Gujarati which he understood, he was punished...

...I know now that what I took four years to learn of arithmetic, geometry, algebra, chemistry and astronomy I should have learnt easily in one year if I had not to learn them through English but Gujarati. My grasp of the subjects would have been easier and clearer…"{CWMG/Vol-73/279-80}

After the December-1926 Gauhati Session of the Congress, Gandhi went on yet another tour of the country, and among other things, expressed in his speeches that "he felt humiliated to speak in English and therefore wanted every Indian to learn Hindustani. He even went further and advocated adoption of the Devnagari script for all the Indian languages. Once again, he found South India most enthusiastic in its response to him, and he addressed about two dozen public meetings in Madras city alone."{DD/124}

After the Congress session in October 1934, Gandhi traversed the country and continued his crusade urging everyone to learn simple Hindi:

"We must give up English as an inter-provincial language and introduce into Hindi–Hindustani words from other provincial languages. A common Devanagari script would help as a common script had helped the development of the European languages."{DD/168}

After independence, once when Gandhi was addressing a meeting at Birla House in Delhi in Hindustani, a few in the audience said they were unable to follow, to which Gandhi said: "Now we are independent, I shall not speak in English. You have to understand rashtrabhasha if you wish to serve the people."{DD/290}

According to the then Home Secretary BN Jha the efforts to make Hindi the link-language failed thanks mainly to Nehru and his colleagues. Two big opportunities were lost—one when all chief ministers were agreed in 1961 for Devanagari script for all Indian languages, at the recommendation of President Dr Rajendra Prasad; and the second when a proposal based on parliamentary committee's report was put up in the Cabinet meeting by the Home Minister Pant, to which Nehru had violently responded, "What is all this nonsense? It is not possible to have scientific and technological terms in Hindi," even though Pant's proposal did not cover the latter aspect—Nehru was only expressing his dislike for Hindi.{DD/330-31}

Wrote BN Sharma:

"How is it that after almost five decades of freedom we have not been able to shake off the burden of English and adopt our own national language. That Hindi is the only language spoken by the largest number of people in the largest number of states is an indisputable fact. If a Tamilian or a Keralite can learn English with ease why can he not learn Hindi, whose Sanskrit base is a common source of many words in his own language. Nehru, the Western Oriental Gentleman (WOG) never

really made any sincere effort nor did he muster enough political will to implement Hindi… He [Nehru] used specious arguments, such as lack of scientific vocabulary [How have France, Germany, Japan, China, Korea, and many other European and Asian countries managed very well in their own mother tongue?], difficulty in international communications and diversity of local Indian languages as an excuse to stonewall the adoption of Hindi."{BNS/248-9}

No nation is worth its spirit and soul which does not have its own vehicle of cultural articulation that its national language provides.

#### PROMOTING URDU & PERSIAN-ARABIC SCRIPT

Hindi is written in the Devanagari script from left to right, while Urdu is written from right to left, being derived from a Persian modification of the Arabic script. High variants of Hindi depend on Sanskrit for enrichment, while Urdu looks to Persian and Arabic for its higher variants.

Rather than giving Hindi its due, Nehru insisted that Urdu was the language of the people of Delhi, and should accordingly be given official recognition. When the Home Minister GB Pant told him that the statistics showed only 6% of the Delhiwalas had claimed Urdu as their language, Nehru tried to rubbish the statistics, though he didn't press further with his crazy idea.{DD/329-30}

Nehru was also in favour of Persian-Arabic script in which Urdu is written, rather than Devanagari script in which Hindi and Sanskrit are written. It seems that anything Indian or Hindu or representing Hindu/Indian heritage, and Nehru had some problem with it, and he tried to abort it. Ram Manohar Lohia had rightly said that Nehru was against anything that would give Indians a sense of Indianness!{DD/373}

Also, Nehru promoted what he was personally comfortable with: English and Urdu. Not what was good for the nation.

Hindi clearly had association with nation, India, Hindu, and Sanskrit; while Urdu has been advocated by Muslim leaders. The states that became West Pakistan and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) had no association whatever with Urdu; their languages were Punjabi, Sindhi, Bengali, etc.

But, the Muslim leaders from UP who migrated to Pakistan imposed Urdu on Pakistan.

What business Nehru had in trying to favour Urdu and Persian-Arabic script can only be understood if we account for his pseudo-secular character, eagerness to appease Muslims for votes, and allergy for anything rooted in India or in Indian culture and Hinduism.

#### NEGLECT OF SANSKRIT

With the ascendency of English Language Aristocracy and the Brown Sahibs, work in the Indian languages and Sanskrit suffered a setback. See the condition of Sanskrit—unarguably the greatest and the most scientific language. It is becoming extinct. And unless you have mastery in Sanskrit and other older languages you can't do effective research in past Indian history. Said Will Durant, American historian and philosopher:

"India was the motherland of our race, and Sanskrit the mother of Europe's languages: she was the mother of our philosophy; mother, through the Arabs, of much of our mathematics; mother, through the Buddha, of the ideals embodied in Christianity; mother, through the village community, of self-government and democracy. Mother India is in many ways the mother of us all."

One is told that those who have genuine interest in working on the Indian past now go to certain reputed universities in the US, who not only have a rich collection of relevant books, but also have faculty proficient in Sanskrit! So, to research India, go abroad!! This is what India has been reduced to, thanks to the ill-informed policies of the Nehru Dynasty. The comments of Gurcharan Das are worth noting:

"...an Indian who seriously wants to study the classics of Sanskrit or ancient regional languages will have to go abroad…This is extraordinary in a country with dozens of Sanskrit departments in all major Indian universities...The ugly truth is that the quality of teaching in these institutions is so poor that not a single graduate is able to think seriously about the past and critically examine ancient texts... Where is India's soft power when there are fewer and fewer Indians capable of interrogating the texts of Kalidasa or the edicts of Ashoka?...To be worthy of being

Indian does not mean to stop speaking in English. It means to be able to have an organic connection with our many rich linguistic pasts...What separates man from beast is memory and if we lose historical memory then we surrender it to those who will abuse it."{URL45}

The adverse fallout of the above is that gross distortionists of the Hindu cultural and religious heritage like Wendy Doniger of the University of Chicago, and Sheldon Pollock of the Columbia University have become respected global authorities on Sanskrit, Sanskrit literature and ancient Indian heritage. What is more, some rich Indian businessmen have financed them liberally to bring out series based on Indian classics, rather than financing competent Indians. Their interpretations are biased and distorted. It is only lately that people like Rajiv Malhotra and other Indians have begun exposing them. Books by Rajiv Malhotra like 'Breaking India', 'Being Different', 'The Battle for Sanskrit' are worth reading (please check Amazon).

Sanskrit, the most scientific language—suited for AI (Artificial Intelligence) too—and the mother of many Indian and European languages, could have been simplified and modernized (like Israel did with Hebrew), and taught in all schools, in addition to English. It would have revitalized India, and helped unify it.

Many opine that Sanskrit even deserves to be the National Language of India (a privilege currently given to none) for several unassailable reasons. It was the link language and the sole medium of not only religion and rituals, but also of philosophy, metaphysics, literature, poetry, mathematics, astronomy, science, law, jurisprudence, etc. for several millennia in India. It not only has a rich vocabulary, but has a built-in mechanism to generate new vocabulary based on a vast store of base-words and roots. It has a national identity as its vocabulary pervades all Indian languages. No region can claim it as belonging to it alone, hence no regional conflict in its usage.

"On September 11 1949, the then Law Minister Dr B.R. Ambedkar supported by DyMinister for External Affairs Dr B.V. Keskar and Mr Naziruddin Ahmed sponsored an amendment declaring that the official language of the Union shall be Sanskrit. The amendment had thirteen other signatories of whom eleven hailed from South-India including nine from Madras."{URL72}

## RISE OF THE PARASITIC LEFTIST-'LIBERAL' CLASS

*While many studies have documented the predominance of the political left in the academic world, the exceptional areas where they do not have such predominance are precisely those areas where you cannot escape from facts and results—the sciences, engineering, mathematics and athletics. By contrast, no area of academia is more dominated by the left than the humanities, where there are no facts to challenge the fantasies that abound. Leftists head for similar fact-free zones outside of academia.*

—Thomas Sowell

In India, you just have to get familiar with the "leftist, anti-American, pro-Arab, anti-Israel, 'secularist', Hindu-baiting, Muslim-apologist, Nehruvian, JNU-type" refrain and jargon to qualify as an intellectual and a "liberal". It's that easy. No serious knowledge or expertise or research work or analytical ability or originality or depth or integrity is required. The origin, spread, and entrenchment of this class has been thanks to Nehru and his Dynasty.

Besides, it is safe. Others won't heckle you. Because, these typical Indian leftists have an invisible, informal brotherhood. They support, defend and promote one another, ensure their predominance in the academe and government bodies, and stoutly defend their turf. They are also "eminent" invitees on TV and public functions, seriously ventilating their hackneyed, stale ideas. These windbags have not come up with a single original idea in the last seven decades. The Leftist–Socialist-Liberal "Intellectual" is actually an oxymoron, and an anachronism.

The typical Nehruvian-Socialist-"Secular"-"Liberal" "Intellectual" parasitic cabal that has spawned the academe, the cultural, literary, archaeological and historical bodies, and sarkari establishments, and has infested and dominated the opinion-making arms like the media unfortunately represents the worst in intellectual traditions, and has become a major stumbling block in progress, for it has managed to pervert sensible discourse. It is even "liberal" and fashionable to be anti-national!

It supports a globally discredited socialistic economic world-view that has practically and amply demonstrated its poverty-perpetuating, miserymultiplying, anti-poor, anti-prosperity, anti-anything-good characteristics.

Its "Secularism" does not rise above religion; but is restricted to being anti-Hindu and pro-Muslim, and being unmoved and unconcerned by blatantly illegal proselytization. Its "Liberalism" is being pro-Animal rights while being pro-beef and pro-nonveg; being anti-American while yearning for green-card or assignments in the US; being a rationalist by slamming all Hindu customs and beliefs, while keeping mum on regressive practices of Islam or Christianity; being pro-Arab and anti-Israel; being anti-Sanskrit while being pro-German or pro-foreign language; and so on.

They oppose renaming Aurangzeb road, but never raise a voice against naming of hundreds of government schemes and institutions after the Nehru-Gandhis. They talk of common man and justice and rage about inequality, but find nothing uncommon or no injustice or no inequality in the unjust shameless continuance of the Dynasty! They shout against intolerance, but are themselves the prime examples of intolerance for alternate view (despite it being far superior to theirs)!!

It has been said that true "intellectuals tend to have uneasy relationship with the status quo". However, this deracinated Indian "Intellectual" class has become uncomfortable with the change in the status quo. They feel comfortable only when cocooned in their good, old Nehruvian, "secular", socialistic, I-scratch-your-back-you-scratch-mine, mutually beneficial, incestuous, quid pro quo milieu, at home with the Nehru-Gandhi Dynasty.

#### MENTAL & CULTURAL SLAVERY

#### NEHRU : "THE LAST ENGLISHMAN TO RULE INDIA"

We managed to break the shackles of economic and political slavery. But mental and cultural slavery—that we have willingly adopted! That Gandhiji had done much to counter that slavishness is well-known. But, what is strange is that little was done in the post-independence period by Gandhiji's chosen protégé—Nehru—to carry forward Gandhiji's legacy. If anything the mental and cultural slavery increased—in no small measure to the examples set by Nehru himself, and the policies that flourished under him.

Gandhi had once told: "Jawahar wants Englishmen to go but Angreziat to stay. I want Angreziat to go but Englishmen to remain as our friends."{DD/261} Knowing this, why Gandhi chose Nehru as prime minister is a mystery.

Gandhi used to say that even though Nehru used to fight with him on many issues, ultimately he used to agree with him [Gandhi]. Little did Gandhi know that it was not because Nehru agreed with him, but because Nehru knew that to continue to differ from Gandhi might cost him his position like it happened with Netaji Subhas—and his goal of becoming the prime minister. Gandhi had also said that after he would be no more, Nehru would speak his language. If Gandhi had watched from heaven, he would have known that Nehru had buried Gandhism along with his [Gandhi's] death. Incidentally, this last thing was told by a Nehru loyalist, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai, himself: "Jawaharlal has performed the last rites not only of Gandhi but of Gandhism as well."{DD/279}

Nehru was reported to have said about himself: "Galbraith, *I am the last Englishman to rule India!* " {Wolp2/23} Nehru said this privately in his conversation with the American ambassador JK Galbraith. The remark is also mentioned in Fareed Zakaria's book, 'The Post-American World'{Zak} . We had such great swadeshi nationalists! Nehru had also remarked: "…*in my likes and dislikes I was perhaps more an Englishman than Indian. I looked upon the world from an Englishman's standpoint* ."{RNPS/100} It was one thing to feel so, but quite another to be self-complementary or arrogant about it, unless you were not a proud, patriotic, rooted Indian.

In fact, when Nehru had returned to Allahabad from London after his studies, *the then British Governor of UP had hoped that George (as Jawaharlal was known in the British Indian circles then) would be Lord Macaulay's dream of a Brown Englishman come true* . {YGB/ix} Nehru seemed to fit well with what Lord Thomas Babington Macaulay, the 'Pope' of British–English education in India, had conceptualised in his Minute on Education on 2 February 1835:

"We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect."{URL26}

Effectively, what Macaulay advocated was creation of a new caste: an elite class of anglophiles—the 'Brown Sahibs'. And, that's what the Nehrus were. Motilal Nehru had once banned the use of any language other than English in his house, creating thereby difficulties for those in his large household who didn't know English.{Akb/27} Jawaharlal Nehru was the epitome of a Brown Sahib with a white interior—an uber-Macaulayite.

In his book 'Jawaharlal Nehru, a Biography' Sankar Ghose wrote:

"Malcolm Muggeridge, after seeing *Nehru* shortly before his death, characterized him as *'a man of echoes and mimicry, the last viceroy rather than the first leader of a liberated India* ', and regretted that Nehru was much too British in his approach to have been able to bring about significant or radical changes in India."{SG/193}

Remarked Nirad Chaudhuri in his 'Autobiography of an Unknown Indian, Part-II': "*Nehru was completely out of touch with the Indian life even of his time, except with the life of the self-segregating Anglicised set of upper India who lived in the so-called Civil Lines* ."{NC2} Chaudhuri said that Nehru had little understanding of the actual India life or culture or of Hinduism; and *was a snob, contemptuous of those who spoke English with an Indian accent* .

Wrote Brig. BN Sharma: "Nehru's personality acquired a superficial Indianness and a love for English mores without developing a deep insight into the core of either culture or philosophy."{BNS/10}

NB Khare, the president of the All-India Hindu Mahasabha, had said in 1950 that Jawaharlal Nehru was "*English by education, Muslim by culture, and Hindu by an accident [of birth]* ."{Akb/27}

#### MONUMENTS TO SLAVISHNESS

Colonial Statues, Names

Right in the heart of New Delhi, at India Gate, staring at all the passersby—including the freedom fighters, the bureaucrats, the politicians, the ministers—stood the statue of King George V for two decades after 1947!

It was only when Bulganin and Khrushchev visited India in late 1955 that India changed the names Kingsway to Rajpath and Queensway to Janpath in New Delhi, lest the guests feel shocked at our slavishness! However, Khrushchev did not fail to notice the statue of King George V opposite India Gate when driving down Rajpath, and wondered why the relic still stood. But, it was only in 1968 that the statue was removed, and that too upon public outcry!{DD/323}

#### Colonial Clubs

Bengal Club in Kolkata did not allow Indians till a decade after Independence! Breach Candy Club in Mumbai continued with its sign "Dogs and Indians not allowed" well after Independence!! British openly insulted and humiliated Indians by having such signage in various clubs,

train bogies, and other places. Yet, you have many shameless, ignorant Indians still behaving dog-like and praising and admiring the British rule. Khushwant Singh wrote that he was turned away from Madras Club because he was wearing sandals. In another context he wrote that their group was invited to Delhi Gymkhana for a cocktail only to check whether they were properly anglicised and fitted-in!

# Colonial Ways

Wrote RNP Singh in 'Nehru: A Troubled Legacy': "Even after independence, Nehru's mental make-up continued to remain as that of the British. He showed a surprise attachment to the old standards set by the [colonial] rulers. At informal dinners at the Prime Minister's house, a liveried attendant stood behind each guest. After twelve years of independence, Harold Macmillan, during his brief visit to India had observed, 'All the etiquette and ceremony were preserved according to the old style. The plates and china remained, with their arms and heraldic devices. The pictures of the viceroys were on the walls… All the pomp and circumstances were unchanged. We were also the chief guests at garden party; there also in the old style with the old viceroy's guard in their splendid uniforms, the trumpeters, the Military Secretary and the ADCs (all in full military).' During the same period, the American ambassador, JK Galbraith [1961–63], after a visit to Wellington in South India noted in his diary, 'The Indian Army officers favour all British Army manners from dress, salute, drill and whisky to moustache. The Queen's picture hangs prominently in the officers' mess.'"{RNPS/97}

# Western Mores

Wrote Durga Das: "...several ministers who used to squat on the floor and eat off brass plates or plantain leaves in their homes were now trying to ape Western ways. They contended that Nehru considered only Westernised people modern..."{DD/292}

Khushwant Singh mentions about an Indian High Commissioner in Canada, who was a member of ICS, and uncle of his wife, in his autobiography 'Truth, Love and a Little Malice', "...for the Maliks culture meant being well-dressed, knowing European table manners and having a familiarity with exotic drinks like Old Fashioned, Manhattan, ..."{KS/124}

Like the ICS, the brown sahibs and people like the Nehrus, army was yet another bastion afflicted by the disease. Wrote Kuldip Nayar reporting on

the position on the front during India-China war:

"I met young army officers sitting in another corner of the lounge. They were bitter and openly spoke of how every requirement of senior officers —soldiers had to carry commodes—were met at the last picket post even while the firing was going on. A captain admitted: 'We are no longer fighters. We think of clubs or restaurants even in the trenches. We have gone too soft; we're no good.'"{KN}

## MOTILAL-JAWAHARLAL-TRIBE VS. RAO-TRIBE

There was already a tribe of brown sahibs prior to independence—whose stellar representatives were Motilal-Jawaharlal Nehru*—* but with the departure of the whites, this tribe entrenched itself. Slavishly imitating the West, and adopting their mores was "forward-looking" and being "modern" and "advanced".

Without being jingoistic, one must adopt good things, even if foreign. But, there is a big difference between being rational, scientific, liberal, forward-looking, yet self-respecting; and being slavish show-offs and imitators. You can't start rubbishing your history, language, religion, culture, music, eating habits, medicinal practices, and so on to appear modern. To imitate is a cheap way of appearing forward-looking.

You notice a sharp contrast between the Motilal-Jawaharlal-tribe and the Narsimha Rao-tribe? Motilal-Jawaharlal-tribe, that is, the Motilal Nehru dynasty, the imitators like Motilal Nehru, his son, the ICS tribe and the like, went to ridiculous extent to be more English than the Englishmen. They regarded knowing English and being anglicised as enough qualities for gaining positions and privileges, and they bent over backwards to please the English and westerners. They were afflicted by what can be termed as the "Coolie-complex" which resulted in their internalising an inferioritycomplex, self-loathing, and a contempt for things Indian, particularly Hindu religion, culture and traditions; and made them ape the West.

On the other hand, the *Rao-tribe* , that is, the current young generation of information technologists, finance professionals, management consultants and the like, who have come up thanks to reversal of the Nehru Dynasty's economic policies by Narsimha Rao, are confident professionals meeting all —English, Americans, Europeans, Australians, Canadians, Japanese, Chinese, Singaporeans—on equal terms, never considering it necessary to know Queen's English (SMS English or Working English being sufficient),

or to imitate their mores and habits, merely to look "like them". In fact, if this Jeans generation gets to know of the *Motilal-Jawaharlal-tribe* and what they did, they would be aghast.

## DISTORTED, SELF-SERVING SECULARISM & MINORITYISM

Secularism is dissociation of religion from the state. It is the principle of the separation of government institutions and functionaries mandated to represent the state from religious institutions, religious authorities, and religious functionaries.

With dominance of Christianity in the West the results were disastrous: the Dark Ages, and violent punishments, repressions, tortures, and Inquisitions that continued during the subsequent period. Christianity claimed to be the "only truth" and the "only true religion", and was even opposed to science if it digressed from the Christian beliefs—notable, illustrative examples of victims (or those who, afraid of the Church, tended to hide or delay publication of their findings) being the greats like Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, Charles Darwin.

It was gradually realised that the necessary drivers of a civilised, harmonious, progressive and prosperous state were multi-religious societies, multiculturism, free thinking and propagation of knowledge, and unhindered scientific pursuits—but, all these became victims of the Christian totalitarianism and exclusivism. This led to the advocation of the concept of "Secularism".

However, Indian-Hindu civilisation had built-in secularism, and it did not just readily accept, it freely promoted, multi-ethnicity, multi-religions, and multiculturism; and its Dharmic traditions actively promoted and encouraged pursuit of knowledge and science—quite unlike and in sharp contrast to the latter-two Abrahamic faiths. No wonder, Indian mathematics, astronomy, medicine, etc. were centuries ahead of the West. Yet, copycat and anglophile Nehru, who neither had a deep understanding of the Western civilisational evolution, nor of India, grabbed on "secularism", without realising it was irrelevant for India, as it was built into the Indian-Hindu ethos.

On the occasion of the opening of the Ramakrishna Mission Institute in Calcutta in 1961, together with the inauguration there of a conference on spiritual life, Nehru burst out in his speech:

"I have always avoided using the word spirituality because of the existence of much bogus spirituality. India is a hungry nation. To talk of spirituality to hungry men does not mean anything… It is no good running away from the daily problems of life in the name of spirituality. I am out of place in this gathering—I am supposed to open this building and inaugurate the conference. I do so."{Croc/136}

What arrogance and ignorance! Was the institute or the conference advocating spirituality to cover up for hunger? Can't endeavouring for a better material life (including, of course, removal of hunger) and search for an enlightened spiritual life go together? If not, in Nehru and Nehru-Dynasty India of poverty-perpetuating socialism, where there would always have been poverty and hunger, there could never have been any place for spirituality!

Author of "Discovery of India" failed to discover that despite different physical features, languages, food habits, costumes, and so on, if there was something that bound India together for centuries from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, and from Dwarka to Dibrugarh, it was Hinduism, and its associated religions like Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism that arose from its soil; and that Hinduism and Indian cultural and civilisational traditions had built-in secularism and multiculturism as they always accepted other religions and minorities.

Wrote David Frawley in his foreword to Sandeep Balkrishna's book '70 Years of Secularism: Unpopular Essays on the Unofficial Political Religion of India'{SBK} :

"India's secularism [founded by Nehru] in fact has been colonialism, not in disguise but in a bold new aggressive and intolerant form, propelled not by foreign rule but by the rule of foreign mindsets by Indians themselves… That something is 'against secularism' became a way to condemn anything Hindu as effectively as missionaries and mullahs had used such terms as polytheist, idolater, heathen or kafir. Secularism gained a new sanctity to override any spiritual basis to India's culture. Anti-secular forces were in turn, deemed 'fascist', revealing the leftist rhetoric behind the charge. There was an effort to make anything Hindu as fascist, just as the Chinese communists regarded Tibetan Buddhism as

fascist… The book documents the cultural genocide that the Nehruvian-Marxist alliance wrought on India over the last seventy years, and its great civilization of many thousands of years, under the name of secularism and socialism. While India did not politically become communist, it was a communist sympathizing culture and was under communist intellectual rule, even long after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. This shadow has yet to be entirely lifted. Lifting it is the intellectual necessity for India to progress whether materially or culturally…"{SBK}

Jinnah's call for observance of 'Direct Action Day' on 16 August 1946 had led to the Calcutta Carnage, or the Great Calcutta Killings. It was the worst communal carnage committed by the Muslim League that left 5,000 to 10,000 dead, 15,000 injured, and about one lakh homeless! HS Suhrawardy, who was heading the Muslim League–dominated government in Bengal (and who then came to be known as the "butcher of Calcutta"), rather than controlling the situation, further instigated the Muslim goondas. Nehru, as the Vice President of the Executive Council (that became the Interim Government on 2 September 1946, with Nehru as the PM) did little to bring relief to the victims on the specious plea of provincial autonomy that law and order was a state subject, hence the domain of the Bengal Provincial Government. However, when there was a reaction later to the Calcutta killings in Bihar, Nehru himself rushed to Bihar ignoring the fact of provincial autonomy, even threatening the Bihari Hindus with bombings (!): if Muslims kill Hindus, then ignore, or make excuses, or hide behind technical grounds; but if Hindus counter-react to Muslim killings, immediately get into action against the Hindus!

Among many other matters where Patel and Nehru had divergent positions was the issue of Ajmer riots soon after independence. In the Ajmer communal riots, notwithstanding the undisputed mischief of the Muslims, while Sardar Patel rightly backed the Chief Secretary Shankar Prasad, Nehru intervened through his private secretary HVR Iyengar to mollycoddle violent Muslims, and instructed that as many Hindus (though they were not the guilty party) as Muslims be arrested—to maintain balance!{IE}

Nehru allowed inundation of West Bengal and Assam by Muslims from East Pakistan (Bangladesh) drastically changing its demographics. It didn't dawn upon him that it was the changed demographics that led to the

creation of Pakistan; and allowing demographics to freely change in independent India may again lead to divisions. Nehru turned a blind eye to illegal and rampant proselytization by the Christian missionaries the net effect of which was the secessionist movements in the North-east. A genuine secularist and a wise, visionary leader would have known that ensuring Hindus (that includes Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, etc.) continued to be an overwhelming majority in India was the guaranteed way of ensuring permanence of genuine secularism, and a bulwark against communalism the latter two Abrahamic religions, with their claims of being the "only true religion", being exclusivist, proselytizing, and anti-secular: witness the many no-go zones in India where Muslims are in majority; or disallowing Hindus to vote in certain areas in Bengal where Muslims are in majority; or the driving away of the Kashmiri Pandits from the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley; or the unpardonable abusive language that the Muslim and Christian missionaries use against Hindu gods and traditions.

Wrote the veteran Congress leader DP Mishra: "…And so far as Nehru was concerned, he had apparently expected secularism to be practised only by the Hindus…" However, when it came to grabbing power, and getting votes, for Nehru, his "secularism" was no constraint. The Congress so manoeuvred that in the 1957-elections the Bishop of Kottayam issued an appeal to the Kerala Christians to vote for the Congress. The Congress entered into an alliance with the Muslim League in Kerala to grab power. Nehru forgot all about the Uniform Civil Code laid down in the Directive Principles of the State Policy, which could have vastly benefited Muslims women, once he realised that thanks to Mullahs, and conservative but influential Muslim groups, it could cost his party Muslim votes.

Nehru's secularism was leveraging religious minorities for vote-bank politics. Unlike the minorities, Hindus did not vote as a block, and therefore, doing injustice to the majority religion (Hinduism) didn't affect votes. However, favouring religious minorities did yield vote dividend, as they voted on religious lines. Nehru was quick to grasp the convenient road to votes and power, and in the garb of secularism, acted in a way as to procure the votes of the religious minorities. Like in the economic field where Nehru laid the foundations of misery through his debilitating socialism; in the political and electoral field, he laid the foundations of harmful, competitive, religious minoritysm.

Nehru, as head of the Interim Government, had moved an Object Resolution, resulting in Articles 29 and 30 of the Constitution, on 13 December 1946, with a view to appease the Muslim League so that it does not press for Partition. However, Partition and Pakistan became a reality on 15 August 1947—yet, the Articles 29 and 30 of the Constitution, meant to avert Partition, continued to be debated after the creation of Pakistan, and were finally included in the Constitution: a clear and irresponsible case of Minority appeasement by Nehru.{PG2/73}

## NEHRU & UNIFORM CIVIL CODE (UCC)

Article 44 of the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) in India sets implementation of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) as a duty of the State. UCC is meant to replace the personal laws based on the scriptures and customs of various religious communities in India with a common law governing every citizen. These laws cover marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption and maintenance. The concept of DPSP was inspired by and based on the following: the Irish Constitution, the Declaration of the Rights of Man proclaimed by Revolutionary France, the Declaration of Independence by the American Colonies, and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

In the spirit of the DPSP while the Hindu Code Bills were passed during 1950s, nothing was done to amend the Muslim Personal Laws, despite many prominent Muslims advocating it (with Mullahs and some Muslim bodies expectedly opposing it), including Mahommedali Currim Chagla (MC Chagla), an Indian jurist, diplomat, Cabinet Minister, and the Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court from 1948 to 1958, who had made a vehement plea in favour of UCC. Wrote MC Chagla:

"Consider the attitude of the Government to the question of a uniform civil code. Although the Directive Principles of the State enjoins such a code, Government has refused to do anything about it on the plea that the minorities will resent any attempt at imposition. Unless they are agreeable it would not be fair and proper to make the law applicable to them. I wholly and emphatically disagree with this view. The Constitution is binding on everyone, majority and minority; and if the

Constitution contains a directive, that directive must be accepted and implemented. Jawaharlal showed great strength and courage in getting the Hindu Reform Bill passed, but he accepted the policy of laissez-faire where the Muslims and other minorities were concerned. I am horrified to find that in my country, while monogamy has been made the law for the Hindus, Muslims can still indulge in the luxury of polygamy. It is an insult to womanhood; and Muslim women, I know, resent this discrimination between Muslim women and Hindu women."{MCC/85}

For Nehru, power was sacrosanct. Power required getting elected. And, that required votes. Why disturb the apple-cart? If introducing UCC may cost Muslim votes, why do it? Rights and freedom of Muslim women could wait—indefinitely. Let them continue to suffer. Nehru didn't mind "good things" as long as it didn't cost him votes.

Islamic and Muslim-majority countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, etc. have since reformed their personal laws, but NOT the "secular" India. Even during the Nehruvian times, President Ayub Khan of Pakistan and President Habib of Tunisia had changed the Muslim Personal Law in their respective countries. Wrote Brig. BN Sharma:

"His [Nehru's] actions, deliberate and inadvertent, encouraged a separate Muslim identity in the Indian polity whose thoughts and actions were not always co-terminus with the national ethos. By instilling a sense of insecurity in the Muslim minds and thereby encouraging a ghetto mentality and posing as their champion, he berated and denounced the so-called Hindu majority as communal, hoping to create a permanent Hindu-Muslim schism and vote-bank for the Congress… His successors perpetuated the game…"{BNS/264}

To cover-up for his vote-bank politics, Nehru tried to take the expedient plea in the garb of being a "liberal" and a "secular" that a Hindu-majority nation like India would not like to touch the personal laws of the minority, unless the minority itself wants it. The question is: Did Mullahs represent the Muslims? Did Nehru ascertain the wishes of the Muslim women? If Nehru was genuinely a liberal and a secular person, he would rather have said: "We would formulate UCC by involving all concerned. We would educate all Indians on the benefits of UCC. We would educate the Muslims on the reforms that have taken place in Islamic countries. We would encourage wide-ranging discussions. After that, we would ascertain the

wishes of each gender in each religious community, including Muslims, through a secret ballot."

It is worth noting that in its judgement of 10 May 1995, the Supreme Court of India reasserted the need of a Uniform Civil Code, commenting that the successive governments till date had been remiss in their duty of implementing their Constitutional mandate enshrined in the Directive Principles; and averred that a UCC was imperative both for the protection of the oppressed and the promotion of national unity.

Incidentally the Goa state has UCC regardless of religion, gender, and caste—Hindu, Muslim and Christians in Goa are all bound with the same law related to marriage, divorce and succession. If there can be a UCC in one state in India, why not in others, especially when it would benefit women. Notably, when the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for criminal offences is uniformly applicable to all communities, that is, in a way, there is a 'Uniform Criminal Code', why not 'Uniform Civil Code'? Is it because for the Muslims the Sharia is far more stringent on the criminal aspect—cutting off both hands for theft, stoning to death for adultery, and so on—compared to the IPC? Choose IPC for crimes, and for civic cases choose Personal Laws, because they favour males over females!

'SICKULARISM' VS. SOMNATH TEMPLE

*(On Junagadh, please read Blunder#31; and on Somnath and Mahmud of Ghazni, please read Blunder#92, 93.)*

Somnath Temple is on the shore of the Arabian sea in the coastal town of Somnath at Prabhaspatan near Veraval in Junagadh district in Kathiawar in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat. It is 6km from Veraval, and 80km from Junagadh. It is the most sacred of the twelve Aadi Jyotirlings. The temple is said to have been first built sometime before the common era—BCE. It was destroyed and looted six times: by Junayad, the Arab governor of Sind, in 725 CE; by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1024 CE; by Sultan Allauddin Khilji in 1296 CE; by Muzaffar Shah I, the Sultan of Gujarat, in 1375 CE; by Mahmud Begda, the Sultan of Gujarat in 1451 CE; and by Aurangzeb in 1701 CE. But, each time it was rebuilt.

At the time of liberation of Junagadh in November 1947 (Blunder#31), Sardar Patel also visited the Somnath Temple (located in the Junagadh State), then in a dilapidated condition, and pledged to reconstruct and restore it to its original glory. Gandhi, when advised by Patel of the commitment, suggested the funds for restoration must come from the public—Patel accepted the advice.

The then Education Minister Maulana Azad, under whom the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) came, opposed the idea of renovation and suggested that the ruins be handed over to the ASI and preserved in asis condition. Significantly, he never suggested the same for the Muslim shrines and mosques being repaired by the ASI.{Mak/140}

Upon the death of Sardar Patel, the task was taken forward by the cabinet minister KM Munshi. However, Nehru made no bones about his opposition to the project, and made snide remarks, telling Munshi: "*I don't like your trying to restore Somnath. It is Hindu revivalism* ."{Mak/141}

Cultured and learned Munshi, of course, sent an appropriate and telling reply to Nehru, which included the words:

"It is my faith in the past which has given me the strength to work in the present and to look forward to our future. I cannot value freedom if it deprives us of the Bhagavad Gita or uproots our millions from the faith with which they look upon our temples and thereby destroys the texture of our lives…"{Mak/154}

KM Munshi had invited President Dr Rajendra Prasad to attend the inaugural function of the rebuilt Somnath temple in May 1951. Protesting vehemently, Nehru opposed Dr Prasad's attending the ceremony, and wrote to him:

"I confess that I do not like the idea of your associating yourself with a spectacular opening of the Somnath Temple. This is not merely visiting a temple, which can certainly be done by you or anyone else, but rather participating in a significant function which unfortunately has a number of implications…"{Swa4}

Nehru also wrote to Rajaji on 11 March 1951 in the connection: "I wrote to him [Rajendra Prasad] that while there was obviously no objection to his visiting this temple [Somnath] or any other temple or other places of worship normally, on this particular occasion the inauguration of the temple would have a certain significance and certain implications. Therefore, for

my part, I would have preferred if he did not associate himself in this way…"{JNSW/Vol-16-1/603}

Implications? Anything Hindu, and it hurt Nehru's absurd, defective, and self-serving sense of secularism. Of course, anything Muslim, Buddhist, or Christian never mattered for him in a similar way. Dr Rajendra Prasad, of course, attended, and replied: "I would do the same thing [attend inauguration] with a mosque or a church if I were invited… Our State is neither religious nor anti-religious."{Adv2}

Dr Prasad explained that the significance of Somnath lay in being a symbol of national resistance against invaders. He made an excellent inaugural speech, highlighting, inter alia, that it was the creative urge for civilisational renewal, nurtured in the hearts of the people through centuries that had once again led to the praan-pratishta of the Somnath deity. Somnath was the symbol of economic and spiritual prosperity of ancient India, he said. The rebuilding of Somnath will not be complete till India attains the prosperity of the yesteryear… Such a grand speech! But, at Nehru's instance, Dr Rajendra Prasad's speech was blanked out by the official channels.{DD/332}

It is significant that Nehru raised no such tantrums when it came to subsequent restoration of Sanchi or Sarnath, although the same were done through government funds (while Somnath restoration was through public, and not government, funds). Why? They were Buddhist places! Nehru had problems with only Hindu places!

#### WOULD-HAVE-BEEN COMMUNAL RESERVATION

But for the timely intervention of certain senior, enlightened leaders after independence, Nehru would have carried through yet another major blunder of reservations for Muslims, plunging India further into communal politics under the 'secular' facade, as would be amply clear from the following extracts from the autobiography 'Government from Inside' of NV Gadgil: {Mak/323-5}

"The temperament of Nehru made simple problems complex and gave cause of anxiety, particularly in the matter of defence of the country… Liaquat Ali [Pakistan's PM] came to Delhi in March 1950, had

discussions with Nehru and one fine morning at 10 o'clock Nehru placed before the cabinet a draft of his agreement with him [Liaquat Ali]. I am not sure if Vallabhbhai [Sardar Patel] was consulted before the draft was agreed to. The final two paragraphs in the agreement accepted the principle of reservation for Muslims in proportion to their population in all the services and representative bodies in the constituent states of India. Similar provisions were suggested for the Central Government also.

"Each one of us got the copy of the draft, but no one would open his mouth… I said, 'These two paragraphs nullify the whole philosophy of the Congress. The country had to pay the price of division as a result of its acceptance of separate electorates. You are asking it to drink the same poison again. This is betrayal, forgetful of the last forty years of history.' Nehru was displeased.

"Gopalaswami Aiyangar said, 'There is substance in Gadgil's objections' and volunteered to redraft the two provisions. I said, 'These two paragraphs must go lock, stock and barrel and no South Indian cleverness would do.' Hearing this Nehru replied with anger, 'I have agreed to this with Liaquat Ali Khan.' I said, 'You must have told him that the agreement can be finalised only after the Cabinet's approval. I cannot speak for other cabinet members, but I am opposed to it hundred percent.' On this Vallabhbhai quietly suggested that the discussions should be postponed to the next day and the meeting was adjourned.

"Vallabhbhai called me for discussions on return home. I told him, figuratively speaking, 'The marriage must not take place simply because the father wants it. The bride is not approved. You must speak plainly now, otherwise complications will follow and we may have to repent. *We have decided on a secular government. This agreement destroys that conception* .' The same night I received from him [Sardar Patel] the papers regarding the revisions suggested by Gopalaswami Aiyangar and his [Sardar Patel's] disapproval of them. I noted on them my agreement with him. When the cabinet met the next day, the last two paragraphs were omitted… The other Ministers congratulated me, but it has to be sadly recorded that at the time of discussion on the draft, none of them opposed Nehru…"{Mak/323-5}

## NOT SEEKING REPARATIONS FROM THE BRITISH

Said Will Durant, the famous American historian and philosopher in his book 'The Case for India':{WD}

"British rule in India is the most sordid and criminal exploitation of one nation by another in all recorded history. I propose to show that England has year by year been bleeding India to the point of death...

"But I saw such things in India as made me feel that study and writing were frivolous things in the presence of a people – one fifth of the human race – suffering poverty and oppression bitterer than any to be found elsewhere on the earth. I was horrified. I had not thought it possible that any government could allow its subjects to sink to such misery...

"The civilization that was destroyed by British guns... has produced saints from Buddha to Gandhi; philosophy from the Vedas to Schopenhauer and Bergson, Thoreau and Keyserling, who take their lead and acknowledge their derivation from India. (India, says Count Keyserling, 'has produced the profoundest metaphysics that we know of"; and he speaks of 'the absolute superiority of India over the West in philosophy')...

"The more I read the more I was filled with astonishment and indignation at the apparently conscious and deliberate bleeding of India by England throughout a hundred and fifty years. I began to feel that I had come upon the greatest crime in all history...

"The British conquest of India was the invasion and destruction of a high civilization by a trading company utterly without scruples or principle, careless of art and greedy of gain, overrunning with fire and sword a country temporarily disordered and helpless, bribing and murdering, annexing and stealing, and beginning that career of illegal and 'legal' plunder which has now gone on ruthlessly for one hundred and seventythree years, and goes on at this moment while in our secure comfort we write and read.

"Aurangzeb, the Puritanic Moghul emperor who misgoverned India for fifty years when he died the realm fell to pieces. It was a simple matter for a group of English buccaneers, armed with the latest European artillery and mortars to defeat the petty princes. It was the wealth of 18th

century India which attracted the commercial pirates of England and France . This wealth was created by the Hindus' vast and varied industries and trade. It was to reach India of fabulous wealth that Columbus sailed the seas. It was this wealth that the East India Company proposed to appropriate..."{WD}

Edmund Burke had predicted in 1783 that the annual drain of Indian resources to England without equivalent return would eventually destroy India. In 1901, Rajni Palme Dutt estimated that one-half of the net revenues of India flowed annually out of the country, never to return: "So great an economic drain out of the resources of the land would impoverish the most prosperous countries on earth; it has reduced India to a land of famines more frequent, more widespread, and more fatal, than any known before in the history of India or of the world."

Commented Rajeev Srinivasan:{URL65}

"A strong case has been made by William Digby quoting Brooks Adams that the Industrial Revolution (circa 1760) could not have happened in Britain had it not been for the loot that came in from India. It is indeed a curious coincidence: Plassey (1757); the flying shuttle (1760); the spinning jenny (1764); the power-loom (1765); the steam engine (1768).

"...Digby estimated in 1901 that the total amount of treasure extracted from India by the British was 1,000,000,000 pounds—a billion pounds. Considering the looting from 1901 to 1947 and the effects of inflation, this is probably worth a trillion dollars in today's money. Serious money, indeed. Shouldn't we ask for some reparation?"

However, the most recent estimates are far more than the above. As per a 'Business Today' report of Nov-2018: "Renowned economist Utsa Patnaik, who has done research on the fiscal relations between Colonial India and Britain, has tried to answer a question many Indians are likely to be interested to know—how much money did Britishers take away from India? Patnaik, in her essay published in Columbia University Press recently, said *Britain drained out over \$45 trillion from India* , which to date has hampered the country's ability to come out of poverty."{W.uk1}

In view of the above, like many countries who had demanded apology and reparations from the countries who had tormented and looted them, India too should have assessed, documented and put a financial estimate to

the damages done by the British, should have quantified the loot of two centuries, converted them at 1947 prices, and should then have claimed reparation from Britain, along with written and oral apology. Additionally, a detailed list of all the artefacts, archaeological pieces, precious stones such as Kohinoor and other items stolen from India should have been prepared and reclaimed from the British.

It is worth noting that the arts and treasures that the Nazis took away from the Western countries they attacked and annexed were called loot, and termed unjust, and Germany was forced to return the same to its rightful owner countries. Since the arts and treasures were from the Western countries, and NOT the Asian or African countries, they were loot, and were required to be returned! Loot from the Asian or African countries was not loot. What double standards!!

However, when the ex-colonies like India themselves did not demand return, where was the question of Britain obliging? With anglophiles like Nehru in the saddle, nothing was done in the matter. On Kohinoor, Nehru had made a weird comment:

"To exploit our good relations with some country to obtain free gifts from it [the convenient contention being that Kohinoor was GIFTED (a lie) to the British!] of valuable articles does not seem to be desirable. On the other hand, it does seem to be desirable that foreign museums should have Indian objects of art."{W.n10}

Given such indifferent and baffling attitude, little could have been expected from anglophile Nehru and his Dynasty.

NEHRU AND THE DISTORTION OF INDIAN HISTORY & HERITAGE

Being a vital subject, the Nehruvian blunders with regard to the Indian history, heritage and civilisation are covered under the following four mainheads/blunders:

*Blunder#90 : No De-Falsification of History* . Nothing done to purge the Indian history from gross colonial distortions, and write correct, honest, defalsified history, post-independence.

*Blunder#91: Being Creative with History.* Rather than the above, the Indian history was further distorted by the Nehruvian-Marxist historians.

*Blunder#92: Nehru & Negationism* . On top of Marxist distortion of Indian history (Blunder#91), the Nehruvian-Marxist historians indulged in

blatant negationism, denying or massively diluting Islamic holocaust of Hindu India for about a millennium before the arrival of the British.

*Blunder#93: Distortions of History by Nehru Himself* . Examples from Nehru's writings distorting or misrepresenting portions of the Indian history, or suppressing the unsavoury parts.

*Blunder#94: Being Anti-Hindu.*

#### NO DE-FALSIFICATION OF HISTORY

*"And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed—if all records told the same tale—then the lie passed into history and became truth. 'Who controls the past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.'… The past, he reflected, had not merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed."*

—George Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four

History is not written by the hunted, losers and colonised—it is written by the hunters, winners and colonisers. It is meant to serve their purpose.

The British, rich in their knowledge and experience of barbaric colonisation, knew well how to prolong their oppressive colonisation and prolong their rule on India. Physical control, control through force of arms have their limitations. But, mental control can go a long way. If you have to exploit nations and subjugate their people on a long term basis—for decades and centuries—you can't do it by brute force alone. You have to shake the confidence of people in themselves. You have to make them feel they are nothing—and that they were nothing—before the aggressors. To this end you have to rewrite and reinterpret their history, religion and culture to show how worthless it is in comparison to that of the exploiter. This is what the British politicians, bureaucrats, army-men, writers, novelists and historians did. Hammer into the colonised they are inferior, that they are nothing, that they are meant to be ruled. How? Control and change their education system, their books. Concoct, re-write, distort history. The British had so depicted Indian history and civilisation over the almost two centuries of their dominance that anything Indian had been shown in bad light, and anything of West as something superior. And it had been so skilfully done that foreigners or English do not have to do it

anymore, it is the Indians themselves who have become self-abusive, and appreciators of all things English or Western.

Part of the reason is that the economy did so badly under the Nehru-Gandhis and India became so pathetic that people felt there was something intrinsically deficient about India and the Indians. Rather than blaming Nehru or Indira Gandhi or the Dynasty for their disastrous policies, people began to feel anything Indian was bad, and anything foreign was good. Had India done well after independence the impression would have been diametrically opposite.

You say what you read, and are taught and told. Many books were written by the English and the other foreigners, like Max Mueller, a German, parts of which were either incorrect, on account of limited or deficient research, or deliberately biased and false to serve the imperial or the religious, proselytizing interests. In the absence of books depicting correct position, these books came to be read widely, and some of them became text-books too. Indians have been taught and told what the English and the Christians desired and manufactured to serve their interests. Indians came to believe it. So did others—people abroad in other countries also read these books. Down the generations all started believing the lies as truth. Many Indian writers too based much of their contents on these books written by foreigners, rather than on new research. So, the writings of the Indian authors also started suffering from the same deficiencies, including that of Nehru.

Here are perceptive comments from a genuine scholar Dr KM Munshi in his foreword to his book 'The History and Culture of the Indian People':

"Our available sources of information…, in so far as they are foreign, are almost invariably tainted with a bias towards India's conquerors… The treatment of the British period in most of our histories is equally defective. It generally reads like an unofficial report of the British conquest and of the benefits derived by India from it… The history of India, as dealt with in most of the works of this kind, naturally, therefore, lacks historical perspective. Unfortunately for us, during the last two hundred years we had not only to study such histories but unconsciously to mould our whole outlook on life upon them… Generations after generation, during their school or college career, were told about the successive foreign invasions of the country, but little about how we

resisted them and less about our victories. They were taught to decry the Hindu social system…"{BNS/49-51}

If the British came across something remarkable, which showed India far ahead of the West in the past, they "discovered" its link with the West. If there was something very distinguished about the Aryans, well, they came from the West—India was subject to Aryan invasion and so on. There have been many research-findings and writings to the contrary since, and yet that false impression is allowed to continue in India even today. Apart from further archaeological revelations, an inter-continental research in cellular molecular biology has debunked the AIT: Aryan Invasion Theory. Of course, there is no last word on such things, but there are good reasons to believe that both the so-called Aryans and the Dravidians belonged to India only, and did not come from outside: that has now been proved through DNA studies also. Further, "Dravid" referred to a geographical region, and not to a race.

When that racist Aryan-Dravidian theory was propagated, there were many takers for it among the educated Indians themselves, for they felt it enhanced their status—they were not the wretched "natives", their ancestors came from the West! Such was the level of inferiority complex, thanks to successful British propaganda! Even Mahatma Gandhi, during his South African days, pleaded with the British authorities there that the Indians be treated on par with the British, and not like the native South Africans, for Indians too after all belonged to the superior race, the Aryans—from the West!{DV}{URL31}

See the cunning of the British in propagating the Aryan-Dravidian theory. It helped create divisions—North vs. South— among Indians. It helped them show that if there was something superior about the Aryans, it was because they came from the West. It also helped them show that India had been ruled by different groups who came from the West. First, the Aryans, then the Muslims, and then the British. If British were foreigners then so too were Muslims and Aryans. So why crib about foreign rule, that is, their rule—especially, when they had come only to "civilise" the natives and do good for the country! One can understand the purpose and the motivation of the British and other foreigners; but for Indians to talk like them!!

<sup>&</sup>quot;The general effect of Dharampal's{DP}{DP2} work among the public at large has been intensely liberating. However, conventional Indian

historians, particularly the class that has passed out of Oxbridge, have seen his work as a clear threat to doctrines blindly and mechanically propagated and taught by them for decades... Certainly, he does not manifest the kind of certainty that is readily available to individuals who have drunk unquestioningly at the feet of English historians, gulping down not only their 'facts' but their assumptions as well. But to him goes the formidable achievement of asking well entrenched historians probing questions they are hard put to answer, like how come they arrived so readily, with so little evidence, at the conclusion that Indians were technologically primitive or, more generally, how were they unable to discover the historical documents that he, without similar training, had stumbled on so easily.

"Dharampal's unmaking of the English-generated history of Indian society has in fact created a serious enough gap today in the discipline. The legitimacy of English or colonial dominated perceptions and biases about Indian society has been grievously undermined..."

—Claude Alvares{DP3}

One of the tasks after independence should have been honest and faithful re-writing of Indian history, that had been thoroughly distorted by the West, by taking the following steps: Setting-up of a large, multi-disciplinary, competent team, free from Marxist, "secular" and biased historians to engage in intensive research, and writing of history and social and economic life of India through the ages in as unbiased a manner as possible, pointing out of flaws and gaps and errors in the existing historical works, and supplementing them; and making available the new researched material and the corrected works in various forms: detailed, academic work, for further research; text-books for schools and colleges; books for general reading in an interesting form; and illustrated books for children. All necessary support should have been given to them—academic encouragement, financial help, incentives, ample opportunities, rewarding career for collection and compilation of all available source materials. Historical fiction too should have been encouraged: we need quality books like that from Amitav Ghosh.

Yet, thanks to Nehru and his Dynasty, there was no attempt to write the true history of India post-independence. There has been little genuine work in Indian history after independence by the Establishment. No worthwhile books and text-books on the Indian history have come from the Indian

academe. If some genuine work has been done, it is mostly by those outside the Establishment—notably from historians like Jadunath Sarkar, RC Majumdar, Sita Ram Goel, Dharampal, and so on.

The school and college text-books, and many of those by the establishment historians are a shame. They keep peddling the non-sense of the Aryan Invasion Theory (AIT); Aryan-Dravidian Divide; Indian history as a series of invasions and defeats of the natives, hiding and ignoring the many triumphs and valiant resistance of the Indians. From Babar to Aurangzeb (1526 to 1707), the Mughal rule lasted for less than two centuries, but the school-texts highlight the Mughal period, ignoring or compressing to just a para the far more grand and longer period of the Vijayanagara Empire of over 300 years (1336 to 1646), or the grand kingdom of Raja Raja Chola, or giving far lesser importance to the Shivaji's and Bajirao's reign. Nor is there coverage of India's maritime prowess, and expansion into Southeast Asia: Bali, Indonesia, Cambodia, Ankor Vat either don't find a mention, or are given miserly references. India's ancient prowess in Maths and science and industry and agriculture, and what India gave to the world is also not highlighted

There has been no attempt post-independence to weave India's grand narrative based on India's unparalleled rich heritage, which all students and Indians could be justly proud of. Instead, thanks to the western historians (whose books are still main stream), Nehruvian and Marxist historians, India's "grand" narrative is pathetically negative: losers, succumbing to invaders, faction-ridden, divided, casteist, exploitive, oppressive, condemned to be ruled!

It was expected that Nehru would be concerned about all the above aspects, and would promptly take corrective steps post-independence. But, alas, the writer of 'Glimpses of World History' and 'Discovery of India' was himself a slave to the western thought and interpretations, topped with the distorting Marxist-Negationist lens! Net result: Not only the distorted Indian history remained unchanged and colonial, it actually became further worse with Marxist-Negationist interpretations and distortions, as the next three blunders/sub-chapters bring out.

BEING CREATIVE WITH HISTORY

*Blunder–91 :*

## Deliberate Nehruvian–Marxist Distortions.

Rather than doing what has been elaborated in the previous subchapter/blunder, the concerned establishments came to be dominated by the self-serving babu-academics, and the Nehruvians, Marxists, and Socialists who bureaucratised the academics and ensured emasculation of the direction to what suited the Marxist world-view, and the convenience of the Establishment. What we have been having are political hangers-on rather than capable scholars.

Thanks to the above, the biased, distorted version of history written by the West has continued. Rather than demolishing it, our "eminent" sarkari historians reinforced the nonsense. While the English distorted Indian history for their colonial ends, the Indian leftists-Marxists have been further distorting history for their ideological ends, and to please their masters. Arun Shouri's book "Eminent Historians: Their Technology, Their Line, Their Fraud"{AS2} is worth reading in this context.

These self-serving, dishonest Nehruvian, Marxist academics have done great disservice to the profession of writing history. They sidelined the genuine ones like Jadunath Sarkar and RC Majumdar, sending them to oblivion. Why have they done so? It paid to do so. You came in the good books of Nehru, himself an anglophile, and thereafter in the good books of his dynasty. You got good positions and assignments. Academic mediocrity was no hindrance to promotions and plum positions as long as you toed the Nehruvian-Marxist-Socialist-Negationist line. Not only that, by being pro-British or being soft on the British, you got invited by the West for academic assignments, lectures, seminars, and so on. Also, your mediocre writings got published abroad, and were well-reviewed. You also got Indian and international awards. In other words, it paid to be dishonest, unprofessional and abusive to the real India.

"Nehru's love for English and his leftist leanings spawned a generation of leftist historians who rewrote Indian history in English and put the evidence of history on its head."

—BN Sharma{BNS/246}

"They [Marxist-Negationist Historians] have made India out to have been an empty land—filled with successive invaders. They have made present-day India, and Hinduism even more so, out to be a zoo—an

agglomeration of assorted, disparate specimens. No such thing as 'India', just a geographical expression, just a construct of the British, no such thing as Hinduism, just a word used by Arabs to describe the assortment they encountered, just an invention of the communalists to impose a uniformity —that has been their stance. For this they have blackened the Hindu period of history, and, as we shall see, strained to whitewash the Islamic period. They have denounced ancient India's social system as the epitome of oppression, and made totalitarian ideologies [like Christianity, Islam and Communism] out to be egalitarian and just."

—Arun Shourie{AS2/x}

"In fact, marked characteristic of the Leftist ransack of Indian history is the systematic manner in which they have succeeded in brainwashing at least three generations of Indians to be ashamed of taking pride in timeless, unbroken cultural and local traditions and accomplishments to the extent that both lay readers and students are repelled at and therefore disown them. This perversion also extends to our heroes, saints, poets, philosophers and the rest... Perhaps in no other country has self-hatred succeeded and touched its pinnacle as it has in India."

—Sandeep Balakrishna{SBK/L-2339}

[What the Nehruvian-Marxist historians did] "…In no specific order, it includes a demonization of Brahmins as the root cause of everything wrong with India—from the ancient past to the present. And then there is the whitewashing of the long and voluminous record of Muslim atrocities against Hindus—genocides, forced conversions, industrial scale temple destructions and the economic emasculation of Hindus by imposing the Jiyza tax and the Dhimmi status upon them. This narrative simultaneously also downplays the cultural, civilizational, and economic excellence attained by India under great Hindu dynasties like the Mauryas, Sungas, Guptas, Satavahanas, Cholas, Chalukyas, Hoysalas and the Vijayanagar Empire to name just a few."

—Sandeep Balakrishna{SBK/L-2440}

*Blunder–92 :*

NEHRU & NEGATIONISM

WHAT IS NEGATIONISM?

"*Negationism means the denial of historical crimes against humanity.* It is not a reinterpretation of known facts, but the denial of known facts. The term negationism has gained currency as the name of a movement to deny a specific crime against humanity, the Nazi genocide on the Jews in 1941-45, also known as the holocaust…"

—Koenraad Elst{KE/3}

Negationism is an illegitimate and deliberate distortion, or denial, of historical fact or record. In the Indian context, it is the denial and/or dilution and/or deliberate misinterpretation and/or rationalisation of the terrible, dastardly and inhuman crimes spread over roughly a millennium against Hindus by the Muslims who invaded and ruled India. That millennium of Hindu holocaust, many times worse than the Jewish holocaust, has yet to be exhaustively documented.

WHAT THEY DID? — AS DESCRIBED BY HISTORIANS

As per an article on www.JewsNews.Co.il{W.ih3} :

"The genocide suffered by the Hindus of India at the hands of Arab, Turkish, Mughal and Afghan occupying forces for a period of 800 years is as yet formally unrecognised by the World… The holocaust of the Hindus in India was of even greater proportions, the only difference was that it continued for 800 years, till the brutal regimes were effectively overpowered in a life and death struggle by the Sikhs in the Panjab and the Hindu Maratha armies in other parts of India in the late 1700s.

"We have elaborate literary evidence of the World's biggest holocaust from existing historical contemporary eyewitness accounts. The historians and biographers of the invading armies and subsequent rulers of India have left quite detailed records of the atrocities they committed in their day-today encounters with India's Hindus.

"These contemporary records boasted about and glorified the crimes that were committed—and the genocide of tens of millions of Hindus, mass rapes of Hindu women and the destruction of thousands of ancient Hindu/Buddhist temples and libraries have been well documented and provide solid proof of the World's biggest holocaust...

"Francois Gautier in his book 'Rewriting Indian History' (1996) wrote: 'The massacres perpetuated by Muslims in India are unparalleled in history, bigger than the Holocaust of the Jews by the Nazis; or the massacre of the Armenians by the Turks; more extensive even than the slaughter of the

South American native populations by the invading Spanish and Portuguese.'…"

"Alain Danielou in his book, Histoire de l' Inde writes: 'From the time Muslims started arriving, around 632 AD, the history of India becomes a long, monotonous series of murders, massacres, spoliations, and destructions. It is, as usual, in the name of 'a holy war' of their faith, of their sole God, that the barbarians have destroyed civilizations, wiped out entire races.'"{W.ih3}

"The blood of the infidels flowed so copiously at Thanesar that the stream was discoloured, notwithstanding its purity, and people were unable to drink it. The Sultan returned with plunder which is impossible to count."

—Tarikh-i-Yamini of Utbi, Mahmud Ghaznavi's Secretary{W.ih1}

"There is no official estimate of the total death toll of Hindus at the hands of Islam… The biggest slaughters took place during the raids of Mahmud Ghaznavi (1000 CE); during the actual conquest of North India by Mohammed Ghori and his lieutenants (1192 CE); and under the Delhi Sultanate (1206-1526 CE)… *Prof. K.S. Lal once estimated that the Indian population declined by 50 million under the Sultanate* ,…"

"Apart from actual killing, millions of Hindus disappeared by way of enslavement. After every conquest by a Muslim invader, slave markets in Bagdad and Samarkand were flooded with Hindus. Slaves were likely to die of hardship, e.g. the mountain range Hindu Koh, 'Indian mountain', was renamed *Hindu Kush* , 'Hindu-killer', when one cold night in the reign of Timur Lenk (1398-99 CE), a hundred thousand Hindu slaves died there while on transport to Central Asia…"

—Koenraad Elst{W.ih4}

"Starting with Al-Bilãdhurî who wrote in Arabic in the second half of the ninth century, and coming down to Syed Mahmudul Hasan who wrote in English in the fourth decade of the twentieth, we have cited from eighty histories spanning a period of more than twelve hundred years. Our citations mention sixty-one kings, sixty-three military commanders and fourteen sufis who destroyed Hindu temples in one hundred and fifty-four localities, big and small, spread from Khurasan in the West to Tripura in the East, and from Transoxiana in the North to Tamil Nadu in the South, over a period of eleven hundred years. In most cases the destruction of temples

was followed by erection of mosques, madrasas and khãnqãhs, etc., on the temple sites and, frequently, with temple materials. Allãh was thanked every time for enabling the iconoclast concerned to render service to the religion of Muhammad by means of this pious performance.."

—Sita Ram Goel{SRG4b/244}

"Amîr Khusrû [poet] describes with great glee how the heads of Brahmans danced from their necks and fell to the ground at their feet, along with those of the other infidels whom Malik Kãfûr had slaughtered during the sack of the temples at Chidambaram. Fîrûz Shãh Tughlaq got bags full of cow's flesh tied round the necks of Brahmans and had them paraded through his army camp at Kangra…"

—Sita Ram Goel{SRG4b/250}

"The Islamic conquest of India is probably the bloodiest story in history. It is a discouraging tale, for its evident moral is that civilisation is a precious good, whose delicate complex of order and freedom, culture and peace, can at any moment be overthrown by barbarians invading from without or multiplying within."

# —Will Durant{WD2/459}

"In the aftermath of invasion, in the ancient cities of Varanasi, Mathura, Ujjain, Maheshwar, …, and Dwarka, not one temple survived whole and intact. This is the equivalent of an army marching into Paris, Rome, Florence and Oxford, and razing their architectural treasures to the ground. It is an act beyond nihilism; it is an outright negativism, a hatred of what is cultured and civilized."

### —David J. Jonsson{DJ/86}

"Literary evidence of Islamic iconoclasm vis-a-vis Hindu places of worship is far more extensive. It covers a longer span of time, from the fifth decade of the 7th century to the closing years of the eighteenth. It also embraces a larger space, from Transoxiana in the north to Tamil Nadu in the south, and from Afghanistan in the west to Assam in the east… Archaeological explorations in modern times have, however, provided physical proofs of literary descriptions. The vast cradle of Hindu culture is literally littered with ruins of temples and monasteries belonging to all sects of Sanatana Dharma—Buddhist, Jain, Saiva, Shakta, Vaishnava and the rest.

Almost all medieval Muslim historians credit their heroes with desecration of Hindu idols and/or destruction of Hindu temples. The picture that emerges has the following components, depending upon whether the iconoclast was in a hurry on account of Hindu resistance or did his work at leisure after a decisive victory: (1)The idols were mutilated or smashed or burnt or melted down if they were made of precious metals. (2)Sculptures in relief on walls and pillars were disfigured or scraped away or torn down. (3)Idols of stone and inferior metals or their pieces were taken away, sometimes by cartloads, to be thrown down before the main mosque in (a)the metropolis of the ruling Muslim sultan and (b)the holy cities of Islam, particularly Mecca, Medina and Baghdad. (4)There were instances of idols being turned into lavatory seats or handed over to butchers to be used as weights while selling meat. (5)Brahmin priests and other holy men in and around the temple were molested or murdered. (6)Sacred vessels and scriptures used in worship were defiled and scattered or burnt. (7)Temples were damaged or despoiled or demolished or burnt down or converted into mosques with some structural alterations or entire mosques were raised on the same sites mostly with temple materials. (8)Cows were slaughtered on the temple sites so that Hindus could not use them again.

The literary sources, like epigraphic, provide evidence of the elation which Muslims felt while witnessing or narrating these ' pious deeds'. A few citations from Amir Khusru will illustrate the point..."

—Sita Ram Goel{SRG4a/17-18}

"...historical distortion has been carried out with regard to Tipu Sultan, who in many ways is the Aurangzeb of the South. As the author of a book on Tipu Sultan (Tipu Sultan: The Tyrant of Mysore, Rare Publications, Chennai), I am both amused and amazed at the continuing efforts to paint him as a hero, patriot, and freedom fighter... His seventeen-year long regime was primarily a tenure of military and economic terror as far as Hindus were concerned. He razed entire cities literally to the ground and depopulated them... As representative samples, we can examine his raids in Kodagu (Coorg) and the Malabar for the extent and scale of sheer barbarism and large scale destruction... An excerpt from Bartholomew provides us a representative glimpse: 'First a corps of 30,000 barbarians who butchered everybody on the way… followed by the field-gun unit… Tipu was riding on an elephant behind which another army of 30,000 soldiers followed.

Most of the men and women were hanged in Calicut, first mothers were hanged with their children tied to necks of mothers. That barbarian Tipu Sultan tied the naked Christians and Hindus to the legs of elephants and made the elephants to move around till the bodies of the helpless victims were torn to pieces. Temples and churches were ordered to be burned down, desecrated and destroyed. Christian and Hindu women were forced to marry Mohammadans and similarly their men were forced to marry Mohammadan women.1 Those Christians who refused to be honoured with Islam, were ordered to be killed by hanging immediately. These atrocities were told to me by the victims of Tipu Sultan who escaped from the clutches of his army and reached Varappuzha, which is the centre of Carmichael Christian Mission. I myself helped many victims to cross the Varappuzha River by boats.'... Tipu Sultan in letters to Syed Abdul Dulai and his officer Budruz Zaman Khan respectively, gloats thus: 'With the grace of Prophet Mohammed and Allah, almost all Hindus in Calicut are converted to Islam. Only on the borders of Cochin State a few are still not converted. I am determined to convert them also very soon. I consider this as Jehad to achieve that object.'"

## —Sandeep Balakrishna{SBK/L-2488-2528}

"Quiet hatred is the escape for the traumatised Hindu. Few Muslims realise how deeply they have wounded the Hindu psyche. The reason is that, unlike Christians in the crusades, Hindus have not paid back in the same coin. How then is the Muslim to know? Think of how much sound and fury did the Babri episode arouse. *No Hindu however has said that 62 temples were desecrated in Bangladesh during 1990 alone; a good two years before Babri. Many more after 6th December, 1992. So has written Taslima Nasrin. In Pakistan, 178 temples met the same fate. Within India, in Kashmir to be precise, some 27 mandirs were destroyed* … More recently, the Buddha was felled at Bamiyan."

—Prafull Goradia, 'Hindu Masjids'{PG/8,9}

Prafull Goradia's book 'Hindu Masjids'{PG} lists places of Hindu worship *desecrated in Kashmir: 46 in 1986* {PG/141-2} , and *90 since 1990* {PG/138-40} . It also lists province-wise names of a total of 59 Hindu temples destroyed in Pakistan{PG/143-5} .

Sita Ram Goel's book 'Hindu Temples:What Happened to Them, Vol-I', Chapter-6 'Let the Mute Witnesses Speak' lists "state-wise and districtwise, the particulars of Muslim monuments which stand on the sites and/or have been built with the materials of Hindu temples": it is a long 93-pages (72-165) list comprising hundreds of monuments.{SRG4a/41-165}

#### THE TERRIBLE RESULT

Even more disastrous than the holocaust and destruction of temples described above was the destruction by the Muslim hordes of India's economy and prosperity, and its grand educational system, universities, and rich culture of knowledge, and mass-scale murder of its intellectual-class.

The foundations of science and engineering is maths, and without the latter the former are not possible. India's Hindu civilization and its built-in pursuit of knowledge produced math and astronomy geniuses. India gave to the world the Hindu (wrongly called Hindu-Arab) numerals 0 to 9, placevalue system, decimal system, trigonometry, calculus, and so on (pl. watch videos of CK Raju, Ramprasad Soghal, and others). That the earth moves around the sun, the earth is a sphere, and is not flat, and many such revolutionary ideas were postulated by the Indian mathematicians and astronomers many centuries before they were floated in the West. Given India's strong economy (27% of the World GDP in 1000 CE{W.e1} ) and industrial and agricultural foundations, its unparalleled prowess in maths and astronomy, its vast educational setup and unequalled knowledge, enquiry, and innovation culture thanks to its Hindu civilization—free from Muslim-Christian absolutist dogmas—*India would have been a massive science and industrial powerhouse centuries before the West, had the Muslim hordes not set their foot in India.* In fact, the industrial revolution in Britain was fuelled from the Indian loot (pl. see Blunder#89).

Wrote VS Naipaul{W.ih1}:

"The invasions are in all the school books. But I don't think people understand that every invasion, every war, every campaign, was accompanied by slaughter, a slaughter always of the most talented people in the country. So these wars, apart from everything else, led to a tremendous intellectual depletion of the country... That was ruin not by an act of nature, but by the hand of man. It is so painful that few Indians have begun to deal with it. It's much easier to deal with British imperialism. That is a familiar topic, in India and Britain. What is much less familiar is the ravaging of India before the British. What happened from 1000 A.D. on, really, is such a wound that it is almost impossible to

face. Certain wounds are so bad that they can't be written about. You deal with that kind of pain by hiding from it. You retreat from reality… What I was saying is that you cannot deal with a wound so big. I do not think, for example, that people like the Incas of Peru or the native people of Mexico have ever got over their defeat by the Spaniards. In both places, the head was cut off..."

"'Fractured past' is too polite a way to describe India's calamitous millennium. The millennium began with the Muslim invasions and the grinding down of the Hindu-Buddhist culture of the north. This is such a big and bad event that people still have to find polite, destiny-defying ways of speaking about it. In art books and history books, people write of the Muslims 'arriving' in India, as though the Muslims came on a tourist bus and went away again. The Muslim view of their conquest of India is a truer one. They speak of the triumph of the faith, the destruction of idols and temples, the loot, the carting away of the local people as slaves, so cheap and numerous that they were being sold for a few rupees. The architectural evidence-the absence of Hindu monuments in the north-is convincing enough. This conquest was unlike any other that had gone before."

## PROMOTION OF NEGATIONIST WRITING

"As a student of India's history, ancient as well as medieval, I could see quite clearly that they [Negationist-Marxist-Nehruvian Historians] were playing the Goebbelsian game of the Big Lie. But they could not be countered because they had come to dominate the academia and control the mass media during the heyday of the Nehru dynasty."

—Sita Ram Goel{SRG4b/v}

"The mention made by Maulana Abdul Hai of Hindu temples turned into mosques is only the tip of an iceberg. The iceberg itself lies submerged in the writings of medieval Muslim historians, accounts of foreign travellers and the reports of the Archaeological Survey of India. A hue and cry has been raised in the name of secularism and national integration whenever the iceberg has chanced to surface, in spite of hectic efforts to keep it suppressed. Marxist politicians masquerading as historians have been the major contributors to this conspiracy of silence.

"Muslim politicians and scholars in present-day India resent any reference whatsoever to the destruction of Hindu temples in medieval

times... There was, however, a time, not so long ago, when their predecessors viewed the same performance as an act of piety and proclaimed it with considerable pride in inscriptions and literary compositions… Whatever evidence the ' Hindu communalists' cite in this context comes entirely from Islamic sources, epigraphic and literary."

—Sita Ram Goel{SRG4a/13}

"Since about 1920 an effort has been going on in India to rewrite history and to deny the millennium-long attack of Islam on Hinduism. Today, most politicians and English-writing intellectuals in India will go out of their way to condemn any public reference to this long and painful conflict in the strongest terms."{KE/32, 34}

"Around 1920 Aligarh historian Mohammed Habib [father of Irfan Habib] launched a grand project to rewrite the history of the Indian religious conflict…"{KE/42}

"The Aligarh school has been emulated on a large scale. Soon its torch was taken over by Marxist historians, who were building a reputation for unscrupulous history-rewriting in accordance with the party-line."{KE/44}

"In this context, one should know that there is a strange alliance between the Indian Communist parties and the Muslim fanatics. In the forties the Communists gave intellectual muscle and political support to the Muslim League's plan to partition India and create an Islamic state. After independence, they successfully combined (with the tacit support of Prime minister Nehru) to sabotage the implementation of the constitutional provision that Hindi be adopted as national language, and to force India into the Soviet-Arab front against Israel. Ever since, this collaboration has continued to their mutual advantage as exemplified by their common front to defend the Babri Masjid, that symbol of Islamic fanaticism. Under Nehru's rule these Marxists acquired control of most of the educational and research institutes and policies."{KE/44}

"Moreover, they had an enormous mental impact on the Congress apparatus: even those who formally rejected the Soviet system, thought completely in Marxist categories. They accepted, for instance, that religious conflicts can be reduced to economic and class contradictions. They also adopted Marxist terminology, so that they always refer to conscious Hindus as the communal forces or elements (Marxism dehumanizes people to impersonal pawns, or forces, in the hands of god History). The Marxist

historians had the field all to themselves, and they set to work to decommunalize Indian history-writing, i.e. to erase the importance of Islam as a factor of conflict."{KE/44-45}

#### —Koenraad Elst

Negationism with respect to Islamic conquest of India, and the consequent terrible atrocities committed for about a millennium, comprises the following tactics by the Nehruvian-Marxist historians and Left-Fiberals (Fake Liberals): (1)Simply deny or rubbish the facts. (2)Make sweeping assertions without sufficient evidence, or even despite the evidence to the contrary. (3)Suppress or distort or purposely misinterpret the facts of history for supposedly noble cause of communal harmony—as if the people are fools, and the truth would not be known. (4)Where the position is indefensible, deny the motive, and attribute the causes to something else. (5)Where the evidence of the historical facts stare you in the face, and it is impossible to ignore or suppress or misinterpret the same, try and minimise those facts, and try to pass them on as outliers, exceptional or one-off. (6)Where none of these dishonest tactics can work, try whitewashing. (7)Where even whitewashing is not possible, try whataboutery—if Muslim invaders were so, what about …; and try and show the other party in worse light. (8)If none of these may work, try invectives: the party daring to question the negationists is fascist and/or racist and/or communalist—in a true-blue Marxist-Communist style of labelling and abusing their opposers.

BLATANT EXAMPLES OF NEGATIONISM IN INDIA

Here are telling examples from Arun Shourie's book 'Eminent Historians'{AS2} :

"Their [Marxist-Negationist historians like Irfan Habib, Romila Thapar, Satish Chandra, Suraj Bhan, RS Sharma, etc.] deceitful role in Ayodhya [Ram Janmabhoomi–Babri Masjid controversy]…was just symptomatic. For fifty years this bunch has been suppressing facts and inventing lies. How concerned they pretend to be today about the objective of ICHR to promote objective and rational research into events of our past! How does this concern square with the guidelines issued by their West Bengal Government [Board of Secondary Education Circular] in 1989 which 'Outlook' itself had quoted—'Muslim rule [in India]should never attract any criticism. Destruction of temples by Muslim rulers and invaders should not be mentioned'? But incorporating their wholesale fabrications

of the destruction of Buddhist Vihars, about the non-existent 'Aryan invasion', that is mandatory—to question [these liars] is communal, chauvinist…"{AS2/9}

The following extracts are from Arun Shourie's book 'Eminent Historians'{AS2/63-68} and his b log{AS3}:

Concerned teachers in West Bengal have been so kind as to send me the circular relating to textbooks for class IX dated 28 April, 1989. It is issued by the West Bengal Secondary Board. It is in Bengali, and carries the number 'Syl/89/1'. 'All the West Bengal Government recognised secondary school Headmasters are being informed,' it begins, 'that in History textbooks recommended by this Board for Class IX the following amendments to the chapter on the medieval period have been decided after due discussions and review by experts… The accompanying pages contain two columns: *aushuddho* —impurity, or error—and *shuddho* …'

[Select Samples:]

*Book : Bharat Katha…*

Page 140: *Aushuddho* : "In Sindhudesh the Arabs did not describe Hindus as Kafir. They had banned cow-slaughter." *Shuddho* : "Delete, 'They had banned cow-slaughter'."

Page 141 : *Aushuddho* -- "Fourthly, using force to destroy Hindu temples was also an expression of aggression. Fifthly, forcibly marrying Hindu women and converting them to Islam before marriage was another way to propagate the fundamentalism of the ulema." *Shuddho* : though the column reproduces the sentences only from "Fourthly....", the Board directs that the entire matter from "Secondly.... to ulema" be deleted.

### … *Book : Bharatvarsher Itihash...*

Page 89: *Aushuddho* : "Sultan Mahmud used force for widespread murder, loot, destruction and conversion." *Shuddho* : "There was widespread loot and destruction by Mahmud." That is, no reference to killing, no reference to forcible conversions.

Page 89: *Aushuddho* : "He looted valuables worth 2 crore dirham from the Somnath temple and used the Shivling as a step leading up to the masjid in Ghazni."

*Shuddho* : "Delete 'and used the Shivling as a step leading up to the masjid in Ghazni.'"

… In a word, no forcible conversions, no massacres, no destruction of temples. Just that Hinduism had created an exploitative, casteist society. Islam was egalitarian. Hence the oppressed Hindus embraced Islam!

Muslim historians of those times are in raptures at the heap of Kafirs who have been dispatched to hell. Muslim historians are forever lavishing praise on the ruler for the temples he has destroyed, for the hundreds of thousands he has got to see the light of Islam. Law books like The Hedaya prescribe exactly the options to which these little textbooks alluded. All whitewashed away.

Objective whitewash for objective history. And today if anyone seeks to restore truth to these textbooks, the scream, "Communal rewriting of history".

But there isn't just whitewash of Islam. For after Islam came another great emancipatory ideology: Marxism–Leninism.

The teachers furnish extracts from the textbook for Class V.

".... in Russia, China, Vietnam, Cuba and in other East European countries, the workers and peasants are ruling the country after capturing power, whereas in U.S.A., England, France and Germany the owners of mills and factories are ruling the country."

".... after the Revolution in Russia the first exploitation-free society was established."

".... Islam and Christianity are the only religions which treated man with honour and equality...."

"Thus, not just whitewash, there is hogwash too…"

Wrote Dr BR Ambedkar{Amb7/229-38}{Amb8} : "There can be no doubt that the fall of Buddhism in India was due to the invasions of the Musalmans. Islam came out as the enemy of the 'But'. The word 'But' as everybody knows, is the Arabic word and means an idol… The [Islamic] mission to break the idols thus became the mission to destroy Buddhism. Islam destroyed Buddhism not only in India but wherever it went... The Mussalman invaders sacked the Buddhist universities of Nalanda, Vikramshila, Jagaddala, Odantapuri to name only a few. They razed to the ground Buddhist monasteries with which the country was studded. The monks fled away in thousands to Nepal, Tibet and other places outside India. A very large number were killed outright by the Muslim commanders. How the Buddhist priesthood perished by the sword of the Muslim invaders has been recorded by the Muslim historians themselves..."{Amb7/229-38}{Amb8}

Arun Shourie, however, states: "But today the fashion is to ascribe the extinction of Buddhism to the persecution of Buddhists by Hindus… Marxist historians who have been perpetrating this falsehood have not been able to produce even an iota of evidence to substantiate their concoction…"{AS2/99}

The following is based on Arun Shourie's "Eminent Historians"{AS2/119-20} . Wrote Satish Chandra, one of the "eminent" Negationist-Marxist historian of the Nehru-dynasty stable, in an NCERT Class-IX book on 'Medieval India' that he authored: "Thus, there was no atmosphere of confrontation between the Sikhs and the Mughal rulers during the period, nor was there any systematic persecution of the Hindus, and hence, no occasion for the Sikhs or any group or sect to stand forth as the champion of the Hindus against religious prosecution…" In sharp contrast, Sri Guru Nanak, a witness to the Mughal mayhem, cried to God: "Having lifted Islam to the head, You (God) have engulfed Hindustan in dread… Such cruelties have been inflicted [by the Mughals], and yet Your mercy remains unmoved… O'Lord, these dogs have destroyed this diamond-like Hindustan…"

"…that the spirit of perverting history to suit political views is no longer confined to politicians, but has definitely spread even among professional historians… It is painful to mention, though impossible to ignore, the fact that there is a distinct and conscious attempt to rewrite the whole chapter of the bigotry and intolerance of the Muslim rulers towards Hindu religion... A history written under the auspices of the Indian National Congress sought to repudiate the charge that the Muslim rulers broke Hindu temples, and asserted that they were the most tolerant in matters of religion. Following in its footsteps, a noted historian has sought to exonerate Mahmud of Ghazni's bigotry and fanaticism, and several writers in India have come forward to defend Aurangzeb against Jadunath Sarkar's charge of religious intolerance..."

NEGATIONISM & CREATIVITY IN HISTORIOGRAPHY: WHY UNPROFESSIONAL & DANGEROUS

People like Nehru had strangely erroneous notions on how history should or should not be written. If writing of what actually happened in the past could adversely affect (in their wrong opinion) the present, then give it a

spin—that was their view. So, be creative with history: bury or bend or ignore facts, if so warranted—a thoroughly mistaken notion! Why? *First* , it is a false notion to presume such adverse effects. *Second* , if different writers presume or interpret differently, should each write a distorted history in his or her own way? *Third* , what really happened would anyway be known through other sources, so why play with facts. When original sources and the writings by the contemporaries are available—those who actually witnessed what happened and wrote about them, like Alberuni and others—why would those who care for history be misled by today's creative writers of history? *Fourth* , it is an insult to the intelligence of the general public and readers to be presumed to be gullible enough to swallow wholesale what these creative writers dish out. *Fifth* , it is thoroughly unprofessional to take such liberties with writing of history. It is unwise to try and mould history to suit one's ideological bend or bias, or for political or religious or social or cultural purposes.

Truth should not be fiddled with. People should not be taken for granted or taken for fools that they would believe the junk written—like Nehru thought, or Nehruvian-leftist-Marxist historians or the fundamentalists think. There has to be professionalism in writing of history. If history is painful or unpalatable, so be it. It is better to know the truth, whether it is good or bad, palatable or obnoxious.

For example, should one obliterate from history or dilute or misrepresent the facts of the 1984-Anti-Sikh attacks; or the 2002-Godhra Train-Coach burning; or 2002-Post-Godhra Riots, just because they are unpalatable, or may cause enmity among communities?

People must learn to face the truth, and learn from history. In fact, the sense of what is good and what is bad also changes from time to time: should history then keep getting re-written? It is a misunderstanding of what the history-writing is all about, and silly, immature socialisticleftist-'holier-and-wiser-than-thou'-Nehruvian notions of "what is good for the people that leads to writing of creative and negationist history.

"It would normally be expected that historical writing on Muslim rule in medieval India would tell the tale of this discrimination and the sufferings of the people, their forced conversions, destruction of their temples, enslavement of their women and children, candidly and repeatedly mentioned by medieval Muslim chroniclers themselves. But curiously

enough, in place of bringing such facts to light there is a tendency to gloss over them or even suppress them…

"History books are not written only in India; these are written in neighbouring countries also, and what is tried to be concealed here for the sake of [erroneous interpretation of the notion of] national integration, is mentioned with pride in the neighbouring Muslim countries…

"And yet some writers delude themselves with the mistaken belief that they can change their country's history by distorting it, or brain-wash generations of young students, or humour fundamentalist politicians through such unethical exercise. To judge what happened in the past in the context of today's cultural milieu and consciously hide the truth, is playing politics with history. Let history be accepted as a matter of fact without putting it to any subjective interpretations. Yesterday's villains cannot be made today's heroes, or, inversely, yesterday's Islamic heroes cannot be made into robbers ransacking temples just for treasures. Nor can the medieval monuments be declared as national monuments as suggested in some naive 'secularist' quarters. They represent vandalism. No true Indian can be proud of such desecrated and indecorous evidence of 'composite culture'..."

# —KS Lal{Lal/Ch-1,3}

"Gautier, in his book *A History of India as it Happened—not as it has been written* , tears into the questionable narratives of Marxist historians and quotes many examples of negationism. He says: 'We will never be able to assess the immense physical harm done to India by the Muslim invasions. Even more difficult is to estimate the moral and the spiritual damage done to Hindu India. Finally, Gautier explains why negationism must be challenged. He says '*it is not about vengeance, or of reawakening old ghosts, but of not repeating the same mistakes* '."

—A Surya Prakash{W.ih2}

*What happened centuries ago is no reflection on people now.* Notions have changed. You insult people by twisting the facts. Should the plunder that Qasim, Ghazni, Ghori and other Islamic hordes carried out be swept under the carpet lest it should hurt the Muslims. If Hindu kings did something atrocious in the past, does it mean it should be suppressed, lest it should hurt the Hindus. Christians engaged in terrible atrocities during their campaigns of conversion, inquisitions and colonisation, including the Goa

Inquisition. Should it be swept under the carpet? *Germans educate their children on Nazi atrocities and holocaust—lest those horrid things be repeated* . There has been the "*Truth and Reconciliation Commission* " in *South Africa* to come out with the facts on the apartheid, express regrets, and provide for healing of old wounds. Truth must be known. Then only can one come to terms with the reality and ensure the mistakes are not repeated in the future.

#### DISTORTIONS OF HISTORY BY NEHRU HIMSELF

Westernised and anglophile Nehru examined and understood the India's heritage and historical past through the Western glasses, and his writings carried the same bias and misinterpretation. Here is a sample of simplistic, almost juvenile, comment of Nehru in his 'The Discovery of India', driven by an arrogant presumptuousness, and a condescending Western attitude:

"And yet I approached her [India] almost as an alien critic, full of dislike for the present as well as for many of the relics of the past that I saw. To some extent I came to her via the West, and looked at her as a friendly westerner might have done. I was eager and anxious to change her outlook and appearance and give her the garb of modernity…"{JN/50}

Nehru's books betray no research, or breaking of any fresh ground, although they are readable. His works cannot be considered as works of scholarship. What he wrote in 'Glimpses of World History' and 'Discovery of India' are re-narration of the published material, mostly by the Western scholars, with their Western bias. There is nothing new to learn from it, even at the level of new conclusions or ideas. In parts, it is also wrong on facts and conclusions. His treatment of subjects in his books are superficial. You find no critical appraisals of the topics he dealt with in his books whether on history or on politics or on economics. Many of his interpretations are stale, copycat Marxist. For a glimpse of the distortion of Indian history by Nehru let us take several examples.

Wrote Koenraad Elst: "The best-known propounder of negationism was certainly Jawaharlal Nehru. He was rather illiterate concerning Indian culture and history, so his admirers may invoke for him the benefit of doubt. At any rate, his writings contain some crude cases of glorification of

Muslim tyrants and concealment or denial of their crimes… With Nehru, negationism became the official line of the Indian National Congress, and after Independence also of the Indian state and government..."{KE/38,39}

VS Naipaul stated in Economic Times of 13-Jan-2003: "How do you ignore history? But the nationalist movement, independence movement ignored it. You read the 'Glimpses of World History' by Jawaharlal Nehru, it talks about the mythical past and then it jumps the difficult period of the invasions and conquests. So you have Chinese pilgrims coming to Bihar, Nalanda and places like that. Then somehow they don't tell you what happens, why these places are in ruin. They never tell you why Elephanta Island is in ruins or why Bhubaneswar was desecrated."

Wrote Brig. BN Sharma: "Nehru's original distortion propounded in the 'Discovery of India' in robbing the Indian culture of its soul of Hinduism, and almost making it appear as a composite culture of diverse religious faiths, mainly Islam and Christianity, had far reaching [negative] influence on our modern historians… The pack of leftist and socialist historians [court/establishment historians] nursed on Nehru's half-baked thoughts lost no time in rewriting history…{BNS/59} Nehru's reading of Indian history was thoroughly flawed by the influence of Western writers and his own predilections of looking at it from his Cambridge perch."{BNS/65}

The 'Discovery of India' notwithstanding, its seems Nehru had neither properly discovered the real history of India in several vitals aspects nor grasped the contemporary India, as would be clear from the following faulty interpretation of his in his letter to Lord Lothian dated 17 January 1936: "India has never known in the whole course of her long history the religious strife that has soaked Europe in blood… Some conflict arose when Islam came, but even that was far more political than religious… I cannot easily envisage religious conflict in India on any substantial scale… The communalism of today is essentially political, economic and middle class… One must never forget that that communalism in India is a latter-day phenomenon which has grown up before our eyes… With the coming of social issues to the forefront it is bound to recede into the background."{JN3/147-48} Wrote Dr RC Majumdar, the renowned historian: "Did Nehru forget the torrent of Hindu blood through which Mahmud of Ghazni waded to India with Quran in the one hand and sword in the other? Did he forget Timur's invasion of India to wage 'war with the infidels'… One would like to know in what sense the iconoclastic fury of Feruz

Tughluk, Sikandar Lodi, and Aurangzeb—not to speak of host of others was political rather than religious? Nor does Nehru seem to have any knowledge of Aligarh Movement and its founder… he [Nehru] was… unable or unwilling to face facts."{Mak/139}

For a glimpse of Nehru's distortion of Indian history let us take another example—that of destruction of Somnath temple. Mahmud of Ghazni destroyed the temple in 1024 CE in his sixteenth of the seventeen raids into India over a period of about 30 years, and carried away camel-loads of jewels and gold. It is said that Mahmud personally hammered the temple's gilded idol to pieces and carted it to Ghazni where they were incorporated into the steps of the city's new Jamiah Masjid [Friday mosque]. Thousands of defenders were massacred, including one Ghogha Rana, who had challenged Mahmud at the ripe old age of 90.

Ahmad al-Bîrûnî, upon invitation from Sultãn Mahmûd of Ghazni (CE 997-1030), entered his service, and travelled to India, spending forty years in India. Records al-Bîrûnî in his book Tãrîkhu'l-Hind:

"The linga he razed was the stone of Somnath, for soma means the moon and natha means master, so that the whole word means master of the moon. The image was destroyed by the Prince Mahmud, may God be merciful to him! —AH 416. He ordered the upper part to be broken and the remainder to be transported to his residence, Ghazni, with all its coverings and trappings of gold, jewels, and embroidered garments. Part of it has been thrown into the hippodrome of the town, together with the Cakrasvamin, an idol of bronze, that had been brought from Thanesar. Another part of the idol from Somnath lies before the door of the mosque of Ghazni, on which people rub their feet to clean them from dirt and wet." —Sita Ram Goel{SRG4b/101-2}

Wrote Zakariya al-Qazwini, a 13th-century Arab geographer:

"Somnath: celebrated city of India, situated on the shore of the sea, and washed by its waves. Among the wonders of that place was the temple in which was placed the idol called Somnath. This idol was in the middle of the temple without anything to support it from below, or to suspend it from above [might have been so, thanks to magnets]. It was held in the highest honour among the Hindus, and whoever beheld it floating in the air was struck with amazement, whether he was a Musulman or an infidel. The Hindus used to go on pilgrimage to it whenever there was an eclipse of the moon, and would then assemble there to the number of

more than a hundred thousand...When the Sultan Yaminu-d Daula Mahmud Bin Subuktigin [Mahmud of Ghazni, who was son of Subuktigin] went to wage religious war against India, he made great efforts to capture and destroy Somnath, in the hope that the Hindus would then become Muhammadans. As a result thousands of Hindus were converted to Islam. He arrived there in the middle of Zi-l k'ada, 416 A.H. [December, 1025 CE]... The king looked upon the idol with wonder, and gave orders for the seizing of the spoil, and the appropriation of the treasures. There were many idols of gold and silver and vessels set with jewels..."{URL55}

Yet, in his book 'The Discovery of India', Nehru writes about "Mahmud of Ghazni and the Afghans" in 'Chapter-6:New Problems'{JN/250-4} , a sentence in which goes, "He met with...on his way back from Somnath in Kathiawar."{JN/251} That's all. There is nothing more on Somnath and its destruction!

But, what Nehru totally omits in 'The Discovery of India', he does mention a little bit in his other book which he wrote ten years earlier in 1935—'Glimpses of World History'. In 'Chapter-51: From Harsha to Mahmud in North India', Nehru writes, "But it was in Somnath that he [Mahmud of Ghazni] got the most treasure..." Nehru further writes:

"He [Mahmud of Ghazni] is looked upon as a great leader of Islam who came to spread Islam in India. Most Muslims adore him; most Hindus hate him. As a matter of fact, he [Mahmud] was hardly a religious man. He was a Mohammedan, of course, but that was by the way. Above everything he was soldier, and a brilliant soldier. He came to India to conquer and loot, as soldiers unfortunately do, and he would have done so to whatever religion he might have belonged... We must therefore not fall into the common error of considering Mahmud as anything more than a successful soldier."{JN5/155}

There could not be worse distortion of history. Nehru is labouring to convince the reader that the havoc that Mahmud wrought was not because he was a Muslim, and that a person of another religion would perhaps have also done what Mahmud did. What utter nonsense! Further, Nehru does not dwell on the terrible destruction Mahmud wrecked.

The great Indian novelist, Sarat Chandra Chatterjee (Chattopadhyay), had commented: "They (Muslims) were not satisfied merely with looting, they

destroyed temples, they demolished idols, they raped women. The insult to other religions and the injury to humanity was unimaginable. Even when they became kings they could not liberate themselves from these loathsome desires…"{Akb2/226}

Real history is what historians of that time—contemporaries of Mahmud —themselves wrote. As per the contemporary history, when Mahmud of Ghazni was carrying away the Shiva idol of gold from the Somnath temple, many rich traders came together and offered him even more wealth if he returned the idol. Mahmud's retort was: "*I am an idol-breaker, not an idolseller!* " Wrote Romila Thapar: "Shaikh Farid al-Din mentions a story where the Brahmans plead with Mahmud to preserve the idol, in return for which they would give him immense wealth, but he refused, stating that he is not an idol seller, but an idol breaker."(RT/55} Wrote JL Mehta: "Mahmud spurned the offer [wealth in exchange of the idol], however, and said that he would rather like to be known as the idol-breaker (but-shikan) [but=idol], than the idol-seller (but-farosh)."{JLM/59}

Nehru wrote in 'Discovery of India': "Mahmud [of Ghazni] was far more a warrior than a man of faith..."{JN/251} Then about Mathura, he writes, "Mahmud was anxious to make his own city of Ghazni rival the great cities of central and western Asia and he carried off from India large number of artisans and master builders. Building interested him and he was much impressed by the city of Mathura near Delhi. About this he [Mahmud] wrote: 'There are here a thousand edifices as firm as the faith of the faithful; nor is it likely that this city has attained its present condition but at the expense of many millions of dinars, nor could such another be constructed under a period of 200 years.'"{JN/252}

*What is interesting and intriguing is that nowhere there is any mention by Nehru of how this Mahmud, 'the lover of buildings' as he calls him, mercilessly destroyed Mathura and Somnath!*

Wrote Al Utbi, an aide and secretary of Mahmud of Ghazni, in Tarikhe Yamini: "*The Sultan gave orders that all the temples should be burnt with naphtha and fire and levelled with the ground* ." Utbi wrote that Mahmud first wanted to go to Sijistan, but subsequently changed his mind for "a holy war against Hind", and details how Sultan "purified Hind from idolatry and raised mosques". He also states that the "Musulmans paid no regard to the booty till they had satiated themselves with the slaughter of

the infidels and worshippers of the sun and fire." In Tabakat-I Nasiri, Minhaju-s Siraj hails Mahmud for "converting as many as a thousand idoltemples into mosques", and calls him "one of the greatest champions of Islam". No wonder Pakistan names their missiles Ghazni and Ghori.

Nehru wrote in 'Discovery of India': "Of the Indians, Alberuni [who came with Mahmud of Ghazni] says that they 'are haughty, foolishly vain, self-contained, and stolid,' and that they believe 'that there is no country like theirs, no kings like theirs, no science like theirs'. Probably a correct enough description of the temper of the people."{JN/252} Nehru doesn't seem to 'suffer' from any self-respect and pride for his own country; and instead seems comfortable and fine with anything negative about Indians, but has little negative to comment on the massive destruction wrought, and its wrecker, Mahmud of Ghazni!

Nehru further quotes [in 'Discovery of India']Alberuni writing about the havoc caused by Mahmud, "*The Hindus became like the atoms of dust scattered in all directions and like a tale of old in the mouths of people. Their scattered remains cherish of course the most inveterate aversion towards all Muslims."* {JN/251} *Nehru then comments, "This poetic description gives us an idea* ..."{JN/251} So, Nehru found Alberuni's description of terrible misfortune wrought on India and Hindus *poetic* !

Incidentally, Alberuni had travelled to India with Mahmud of Ghazni during the first half of the eleventh century CE. The book "Alberuni's India"{ES} is Alberuni's written work on India, translated by Dr Edward C Sachau. Here is an extract from what Alberuni, who was a witness to what Mahmud did in India and to India, and who is referred to by Nehru in the quote of Nehru above, had to say:

"This prince [Sabuktagin] chose the holy war as his calling, and therefore called himself Al-ghazi (i.e. warring on the road of Allah)... afterwards his son Yamin-addaula Mahmud marched into India during a period of thirty years or more. God be merciful to both father and son! Mahmud [of Ghazni] utterly ruined the prosperity of the country [India], and performed there wonderful exploits, by which the Hindus became like atoms of dust scattered in all directions, and like a tale of old in the mouth of the people..."{ES/5,6}

Interesting thing is what Nehru chooses to quote from Alberuni, and what he chooses to ignore. Even God cannot alter the past, but "historians" like

Nehru, and the Marxist-Negationist historians, can!

Nehru writes a little on Aurangzeb in his book 'Glimpses of World History'{JN5/314-5} and in detail in his book 'Discovery of India'{JN/291-5} , but remains silent on Aurangzeb's extensive destruction of Hindu temples. Here is what Sita Ram Goel wrote, quoting a contemporary Muslim historian{SRG4b/202-6} :

The author Sãqã Must'ad Khãn in his history (completed in 1710 CE) of Aurangzeb, based on the State archives, recorded:

"The Lord Cherisher of the Faith [Aurangzeb] learnt that in the provinces of Tatta, Multãn, and especially at Benares, the Brahman misbelievers used to teach their false books in their established schools, and that admirers and students both Hindu and Muslim, used to come from great distances to these misguided men in order to acquire this vile learning. His Majesty, eager to establish Islãm, issued orders to the governors of all the provinces to demolish the schools and temples of the infidels and with the utmost urgency put down the teaching and the public practice of the religion of these misbelievers... It was reported that, according to the Emperor's command, his officers had demolished the temple of Vishwanath at Kashi."

"…During this month of Ramzan abounding in miracles, the Emperor … issued orders for the demolition of the temple situated in Mathurã, famous as the Dehra of Kesho Rãi. In a short time by the great exertions of his officers the destruction of this strong foundation of infidelity was accomplished, and on its site a lofty mosque was built at the expenditure of a large sum."

"Abû Turãb, who had been sent to demolish the temples of Amber, returned to Court on Tuesday, the 10th August/24th Rajab, and reported that he had pulled down sixty-six temples."

"The Emperor, summoning Muhammad Khalil and Khidmat Rai, the darogha of hatchet-men, ordered them to demolish the temple of Pandharpur, and to take the butchers of the camp there and slaughter cows in the temple. It was done."

BEING ANTI-HINDU

"Nehru's personality acquired a superficial Indianness and a love for English mores without developing a deep insight into the core of either culture or philosophy."{BNS/10} "Nehru had a known dislike for anyone who stood staunchly for his Indian identity or philosophy, based on our rich cultural heritage, preservation of Hindi language and best of our old traditions…" {BNS/281} —*Brig. BN*

### *Sharma*

"Nehru was completely out of touch with the Indian life even of his time, except with the life of the self-segregating Anglicised set of upper India who lived in the so-called Civil Lines."{NC2} —*Nirad Chaudhuri*

Nirad Chaudhuri further said that Nehru had little understanding of the actual India life or culture or of Hinduism; and was a snob, contemptuous of those who spoke English with an Indian accent.

NB Khare, the president of the All-India Hindu Mahasabha had said in 1950 that Jawaharlal Nehru was "*English by education, Muslim by culture, and Hindu by an accident [of birth]* ."{Akb/27}

Ram Manohar Lohia believed that Nehru's acceptance of Anglo-Indian cultural values led to his opposing anything that would give the nation a sense of Indianness.{DD/373}

~~~

Embedded in many of the blunders in this book are examples of the essentially anti-Hindu and anti-Indian-Civilisational-Heritage character of Nehru—camouflaged under the Nehruvian brand of "Secularism".

Anglophile Motilal Nehru's upbringing of Jawaharlal was such, and, in turn, Jawaharlal's upbringing of his dynasty was such, that they all remained cut-off from the real-India, and developed a natural aversion for things Hindu or Indian.

While on one hand Nehru (a)promoted negationism with respect to Muslim invasions and the consequent holocaust of the Hindus (Blunder#92), and himself engaged in abject negationist history writing (Blunder#93); (b)ignored the constitutional obligation on the Uniform Civil Code (Blunder#86); (c)allowed demography of the Northeast and West Bengal to be very adversely affected by the influx of Muslims from East Pakistan (Blunder#5, 59, 60), thereby compromising their culture and

security; (d)turned a blind eye to blatant, illegal proselytization by the Christian missionaries, compromising the Indian culture, and the internal and the external security, particularly in the Northeast (Blunder#60, 61); (e)promoted Urdu and Persian-Arabic script over Devanagari (Blunder#81); and (f)neglected Sanskrit (Blunder#82); on the other hand, he used his distorted notion of secularism (Blunder#85) to condemn or browbeat anything Hindu; and paint those who advocated Hinduism as fascists; and even opposed the renovation of Somnath temple (Blunder#87)! Please also check in this context Blunder#122-3.

Nehru's bias against things Hindu or the Hindu heritage was, besides his westernised upbringing, the result of his distorted world-view, thanks to his Marxist outlook (Blunder#106-7), that was rejectionist of the past. Most ironically and hypocritically, Nehru didn't apply the same yardstick to the Islamic and Christian past.

Wrote Sandeep Balakrishna:

"Indeed, Indians like Nehru could only arise as the natural consequence of thorough and inescapable colonialized national psyche [Blunder#84]. In his quest to somehow escape British colonialism, Nehru blindly embraced the Soviet variety. His secularism is the ideological love child born by fusing an incurable love for Stalinist Communism [Blunder#106] and an irretrievable alienation from his own Hindu roots."{SBK/L-293}

"…Seventy years of secularism is just one long tale of a project aimed at making Hindus forget and disavow precisely this defining character. Among others, an enduring method used to accomplish this includes instilling a lasting sense of self-alienation and self-loathing using the medium of formal education. The outcome is the cowardice resulting from a complete erosion of cultural self-confidence."{SBK/L-341}

Thanks to Nehruvianism "The average urban, English-educated Indian Hindu since Independence is a stranger in his own land and has today brought to fruition Ananda Coomaraswamy's prophetic warning that this Hindu is 'a nondescript and superficial being deprived of all roots, a sort of intellectual pariah who does not belong to the East or the West, the past or the future.'"{SBK/L-2320}

Given below are some extracts from Nehru's 'Discovery of India' (Kindle Edition from Amazon){JN1} that are illustrative of Nehru's antiIndian-Hindu-cultural-heritage and pro-Muslim-Western mind-set, and his dire lack of genuine scholarship and knowledge:

"On the other hand some famous temples in South India, heavy with carving and detail, *disturb me and fill me with unease* …"{JN1/L-4308}

"Beautiful buildings combining the old Indian ideals in architecture with a new simplicity and a nobility of line grew up in Agra and Delhi. This Indo-Mughal art was in marked contrast with the *decadent* , overelaborate and heavily ornamented temples and other buildings of the north and south. Inspired architects and builders put up with loving hands the Taj Mahal at Agra."{JN1/L-5381}

"*A civilization decays much more from inner failure than from an external attack* . It may fail because in a sense it has worked itself out and has nothing more to offer in a changing world, or because the people who represent it deteriorate in quality and can no longer support the burden worthily. It may be that the social culture is such that it becomes a bar to advance beyond a certain point, and further advance can only take place after that bar has been removed or some essential qualitative variation in that culture has been introduced. *The decay of Indian civilization is evident enough* even before the Turkish and Afghan invasions. Did the impact of these invaders and their new ideas with the old India produce a new social context, thus unbinding the fetters of the intellect and releasing fresh energy?"{JN1/L-5360} (So, as per Nehru, while the civilization of India had decayed, that of the invading Muslim hoards was superior, and carried new ideas!)
