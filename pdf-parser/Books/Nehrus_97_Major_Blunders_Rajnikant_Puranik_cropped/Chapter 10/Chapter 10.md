## 11. HUBRIS, ILL-TREATMENT OF OTHERS

## *Blunder–108 :*

MODEST ACADEMICS, PATHETIC GRASP OF VITAL ISSUES, YET…

*He knows nothing; and he thinks he knows everything. That points clearly to a political career.* —George Bernard Shaw, Major Barbara

While Nehru's academic achievements were rather modest, his knowledge and grasp of issues that mattered were pathetic, as obvious from the net results of his policies—yet, the way he conducted himself, showed off, and belittled others, was as if he was the brightest, all-knowing, and wisest leader around!

He was a graduate and had passed the bar exams. Wrote MJ Akbar in 'Nehru: The Making of India':

"Eventually when he [Jawaharlal] passed in the second half of the second class, Motilal was relieved enough to celebrate lavishly...Motilal was acutely terrified that his son might fail, so even such moderate results were cause for celebrations... Motilal had set his heart on sending his son to the Indian Civil Service...He called the ICS the 'greatest of services in the world'... But the weak Second [class of Jawaharlal Nehru] at the end of Cambridge persuaded Motilal that his son was unlikely to get through the tough ICS examinations...His [Jawaharlal's] expenditure in 1911 was £800, enough to pay for three years of an ordinary student's existence..."{Akb/74-77}

Contrast this with Ambedkar who often skipped meals or ate frugally to save money when he was studying in London. In 'Dr.Ambedkar: Life and Mission'{DK} , Dhananjay Keer mentions that Ambedkar subsisted in London on mere £8 a month! That amounts to £96 a year. Compare this with £800 a year of Nehru, which excluded expenses for several other requirements that were separately arranged by Nehru's father. With all these handicaps Ambedkar graduated in Political Science and Economics from Bombay University in 1912. On scholarship from the Maharaja of Baroda, he went to New York in 1913 and earned the degrees of Master of Arts in

1915, followed by Doctorate in Philosophy in 1916 from the Columbia University. Thereafter, he went to London, where he joined the Grays Inn for Law and the London School of Economics (LSE). He earned his second doctorate from LSE. He also became a barrister.

While Nehru scraped through graduation, Sardar Patel had topped in his exams in London. Subhas Bose was a brilliant student at Cambridge who had also cleared ICS exam. Dr Rajendra Prasad was a great scholar who always topped in his class—his examiner had once written a comment on his answer sheet: "*examinee is better than examiner* ".{Aru/159}

Wrote Brig. BN Sharma: "Nehru admitted to the Harrow Public School, with the influence of his father, never rose in his studies above mediocrity and predictably had a poor legal practice later on. He never distinguished himself either in pursuit of education and knowledge or a single minded devotion to a cause. Nehru was born to greatness and a great part of the credit goes to his father… We Indians have a weakness for white skin… Nehru was inevitable beneficiary of this Indian psyche…"{BNS/7}

Perry Anderson, a British historian and political essayist, and Professor of History and Sociology at UCLA, wrote:

"Nehru had enjoyed the higher education Gandhi didn't have, and an intellectual development not arrested by intense religious belief. But these advantages yielded less than might be thought. He seems to have learned very little at Cambridge, scraping a mediocre degree in natural sciences that left no trace thereafter, did poorly in his bar exams, and was not much of a success when he returned to practise law in his father's footsteps. The contrast with Subhas Chandra Bose, a brilliant student of philosophy at Cambridge, who was the first native to pass the exams into the elite ranks of the Indian civil service and then decline entry to it on patriotic grounds, is striking. But an indifferent beginning is no obstacle to subsequent flowering, and in due course Nehru became a competent orator and prolific writer. What he never acquired, however, was a modicum of literary taste or mental discipline. His most ambitious work 'The Discovery of India' which appeared in 1946, is a steam bath of Schwärmerei [sentimental enthusiasm]. It would be unfair to compare Nehru to Ambedkar, the leader of the Untouchables, intellectually head and shoulders above most of the Congress leaders, owing in part to far more serious training at the LSE and Columbia. To read Ambedkar is to enter a different world. "The Discovery of India"—not to speak of its

predecessor, "The Unity of India"—illustrates not just Nehru's lack of formal scholarship and addiction to romantic myth, but something deeper, not so much an intellectual as a psychological limitation: a capacity for self-deception with far-reaching political consequences."{URL7}

Nehru's treatment of subjects in his books are superficial. You find no critical appraisals of the topics he dealt with in his books—whether on history or on politics or on economics. You find Nehru devoting several chapters to socialism and Marxism in his book 'Glimpses of World History' without dealing with the reported pathetic state of affairs in Russia. His treatment is more romantic than critical. He talks of Marxism, but there is no contrasting coverage on Adam Smith and others, or on the most robust economy of the time—that of the US. There is little attempt in his books to critically assess and evaluate competing options. He talks of state controls and its benefits in his chapter on Marxism, never once questioning that the state itself could be mafia-like, and the biggest exploiter. It is presumed that the state would be a nice, just, empathetic, kind do-gooder, full of compassion. Further, he does not touch upon things like entrepreneurship, individual initiative, and such other critical factors. In the absence of a holistic coverage on the vital aspects that affect economy, his treatment appears no more than just a superficial story. Nehru fancied himself to be a student of history, international relations and foreign policy—actually, a master of these subjects, going by the books he wrote and the way he pontificated—but sadly, he ignored lessons from history, as the results of his policies proved.

Wrote MO Mathai: "Contrary to the general impression, neither Churchill nor Nehru were widely-read men. They wrote and spoke more than they read in their lives." {Mac/55}

Rustamji observed: "On certain occasions, when he [Nehru] had to tell a story, as for instance at a dinner party, he came out with such antiquated ones that one could hardly laugh… He [Nehru] did use wit and humour sometimes in public meetings, but there again the stuff used was juvenile…"{Rust/56}

*Blunder–109 :*

LORDLY WAYS—GOOD BYE TO GANDHIAN SIMPLICITY

Gandhi had spoken thus of Jawaharlal Nehru: "He says whatever is uppermost in his mind, but he always does what I want. When I am gone, he will do what I am doing now. Then he will speak my language too." Had Gandhi watched from the heavens the acts of his chosen protégé, he would have been shocked. Nehru loyalist, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai, had remarked: "*Jawaharlal has performed the last rites not only of Gandhi but of Gandhism as well* ."{DD/279}

Nehru, who had ranted against rajas, maharajas, nawabs and feudal lords, adopted lordly and feudal ways, and allowed the same to prosper under his "democratic" watch. Rather than his master's simplicity, Nehru adopted ostentatious Viceroy-like trappings. After Independence, Gandhiji had suggested that the Governor-General of free India should stay in a modest accommodation, rather than in the huge and imposing Viceroy palace later named as Rashtrapati Bhavan—which should be converted into a public hospital. But, Nehru advised that an alternate suitable accommodation was not available! The place next in stateliness and grandeur to the Viceroy palace was the residence of the British Commander-in-Chief, then called Flagstaff House. Leaving his York Road residence, Nehru occupied this magnificent house, which was later renamed as Teen Murti Bhavan. Others followed Nehru's example, occupying huge, spacious bungalows. British had deliberately designed these palaces and bungalows to intimidate the natives, appear remote, and command respect. What was the logic of the leaders of free India to follow in their footsteps?

Nehru's secretary MO Mathai brought out the contrast:

"At 10 Downing Street, the British Prime Minister has only a couple of suites of rooms for his personal use. All the rest are offices and a few are public rooms... Tage Erlander, the Social Democratic Prime Minister of affluent Sweden, for twenty years lived in a three room flat. His wife was a teacher...The Swedish Government did not provide him with a car. The PM and his wife had a small car which they drove themselves. They could not afford to keep a driver... Labour Prime Minister Joseph Chiefley of rich Australia lived in two rooms in a second class hotel near his office. His wife preferred to live on their farm... The PM was not provided with a car. He walked between his hotel and his office..."{Mac/82-3}

What an irony! The non-Gandhians of the rich, Western countries were being Gandhi-like; while the 'Gandhian' Congressmen of our own poor,

pathetic, post-independent India were adopting the ways of rajas and maharajas, whose feudal, privileged lifestyle they, particularly Nehru, had been cursing all through!

As per MP Raj Bhavan web-site: "On a visit of Jawahar Lal Nehru to Bhopal, the Raj Bhavan staff realised that the favourite cigarette brand of Nehruji '555' was not available in the Raj Bhavan. Nehruji used to have a cigarette after his meals. The staff immediately sent a plane to Indore for air-lifting Nehruji's favourite pack, which was kept ready at the Indore airport."{W.n1}

Wrote S. Nijalingappa in 'My Life and Politics':

"But after becoming prime minister, he [Nehru] left 17 York Road, a fairly large building and moved to possibly the second largest official residence next to the Rashtrapati Bhavan. His reason of doing so was that official dignity required it. In contrast, I may mention the instance of Ho Chi Minh, the president, Vietnam. When I saw him during his visit to Delhi, he said he had only a few clothes and only two pairs of sandals and lived in a small house. But, in independent India, simple living became an exception. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, throughout his stay in Delhi, whether before or after accepting office, lived in a small house at Aurangzeb Road, only large enough for himself and his daughter."

Durga Das recorded: "Mrs. [Vijayalaxmi] Pandit [Nehru's sister] told me: 'I never travel without Ahmed (her liveried peon). The common people know me to be a Minister because Ahmed is with me. They salaam "Ahmed's livery".' Nehru himself realised this well enough when he became the Prime minister and had a retinue of peons and security staff several times the size any Viceroy had had—when he moved among people."{DD/185}

### ARROGANT, CONCEITED & FULL OF HUBRIS

Nehru regarded himself as a great academic and intellectual; a highly knowledgeable individual; an internationalist and an expert in international affairs; a liberal modernist rational of 'scientific' temperament and thinking; and someone who knew what was best for the Indian economy, and indeed for all aspects of the Indian polity and people. Not just that, he was

conceited enough to look down upon most as lesser beings, labelling them in a derogatory way, or using choice adjectives for their remarks or thinking —'childish', 'juvenile', and so on. The irony is that if one studies in depth the various actions and the net result of those actions of Nehru in various fields, one finds that Nehru actually had much to be modest and apologetic about; and little to be conceited about—his naïveté in statecraft was astounding: the blunders recounted in this book speak for themselves.

Many wonder what made Nehru so full of hubris? It could certainly not have been on account of his academics or his earnings or his books. If he knew good English, so did many others. If he was educated in England, so also many others. If he was westernised, so were many others. If he had participated in the Freedom Struggle, so had thousands, and many had actually sacrificed much more. If he thought he was exceptionally intelligent and knowledgeable and a great leader, how come he made so many blunders—all major, with severe long term adverse consequences for the country. In fact, Nehru was able to dominate only because while he was still active in politics, almost all his equals and superiors and potential rivals died—Gandhi, Subhas Bose, Patel, Ambedkar.

His arrogance came in the way of others sharing their opinions with him freely—they were afraid of his temper. This prevented him from heeding sane advice of others and doing course-correction even when things were going down-hill. He made blunder after blunder with no one daring to counsel him.

While in England he wrote to his father, Motilal, in July 1910: "My chief reason for wishing to go to Oxford is Cambridge is becoming too full of Indians!" Such airs from the grandson of the policeman, Gangadhar Nehru! {Wolp2/23} Nehru's white skin, his education in Eton and Cambridge, his westernised upbringing, and his identification with the English mores perhaps made his feel he was entitled to be as arrogant as them, and as contemptuous towards the native Indians.

In a conference of Asian-African countries in 1955, the then PM of Sri Lanka, John Kotelawala, took some pot-shots at communism and Soviet colonialism. Nehru later accosted him and asked him in an admonitory tone why he had not shown his speech to him beforehand. Pat came the reply from John Kotelawala to Nehru, "Why should I? Do you show me yours before you give them?'' {CT}{Mac/191}

Sankar Ghose in his 'Jawaharlal Nehru, a Biography' quotes Zhou Enlai's comment of October 1964, about five months after Nehru's death: "I have met many leaders of the world...I met Khrushchev. I met Chiang Kaishek, I've met American generals. But I have never met a more arrogant man than Nehru. I am sorry to say this, but this is true."{SG/304}

In a lighter vein, it is also said that Zhou Enlai was in fact so highly cheesed off with Nehru's condescending behaviour that he inflicted India-China war to avenge it! During his talks with Kissinger, he was reported to have said that Nehru had become so cocky that China decided to put down his cockiness.

Nehru had visited the US in 1961. Wrote Kuldip Nayar: "Kennedy organised a breakfast meeting between Nehru and top US economists and foreign policy experts. Nehru was late for the meeting and generally monosyllabic in his responses. The breakfast ended in 20 minutes. Some of them reported this to Kennedy who remarked in the presence of his aides that Nehru had 'lived too long'."{KN}

Says Dalai Lama in his autobiography 'Freedom in Exile':

"I [Dalai Lama] then explained [to Nehru] that I had not originally intended to seek India's hospitality [feeling let down by Nehru's attitude] but that I had wanted to establish my Government at Lhuntse Dzong. Only the news from Lhasa had changed my mind. At this point he [Nehru] became rather irritated. 'The Indian Government could not have recognised it even if you had,' he said. I began to get the impression that Nehru thought of me as a young person who needed to be scolded from time to time. During other parts of the conversation he banged the table. 'How can this be?' he asked indignantly once or twice. However, I went on in spite of the growing evidence that he could be a bit of a bully..."{DL/160-1}

Many British found Nehru to be vain and supercilious: Viceroy Linlithgow and Wavell gave him no importance. In their dealings after Indian independence, the Americans too found Nehru to be arrogant.

MJ Akbar in 'Nehru: The Making of India' writes about an episode in the pre-independence period of a number of poor villagers from the villages near Allahabad approaching him to verify their actual extremely pathetic condition first-hand. Nehru was not particularly enthusiastic about taking up the mission, particularly in the hot summers. However, "He was touched

when he learned that hundreds of ill-clad villagers had built roads for him overnight so that his car could take him to the innermost recesses of rural India; and saw the eagerness with which they physically lifted his car when it got stuck in the soft mud. After all, he was still an Indian sahib in a hat and silk underwear."{Akb/129}

#### BHARAT RATNAS—IGNORING THE DESERVING

Bharat Ratna was awarded to Sardar Patel in 1991 and to Dr Ambedkar in 1990! And, that too because there were non-Dynasty governments since December 1989—VP Singh, then Chandra Shekhar, followed by Narsimha Rao.

Dr BR Ambedkar was declared as 'The Greatest Indian after Gandhi' in the Outlook–CNN-IBN–History18 TV Channel–BBC Poll, the results of which were announced on 15 August 2012. Yet, he was given Bharat Ratna only in 1990. In the Poll, while Ambedkar topped with 19,91,734 votes, Nehru, at the bottom at number 10, got just 9,921 votes!{URL66}

Bose was awarded Bharat Ratna posthumously in 1992, which was later withdrawn on a legal technicality, in response to a Supreme Court directive: Government was asked to submit conclusive evidence of Netaji's death—which it could not. However, the intriguing point is how come they thought of the award to Netaji only in 1992—even though the amendment to give awards posthumously was made in 1955 itself?

Radhakrishnan was awarded Bharat Ratna in 1954, Rajaji in 1954, Nehru in 1955—*when he was himself the PM* , Govind Ballabh Pant in1957, BC Roy in 1961, Zakir Hussain in 1963, Indira Gandhi in 1971—*when she was herself the PM* , VV Giri in 1975, Kamaraj in 1976, Vinoba Bhave in 1983, MGR in 1988, and Rajiv Gandhi in 1991! But, Sardar Patel, Subhas Chandra Bose and Dr Ambedkar, being not as great as these worthies, got it later! The Dynasty did not like them!! It has been that personal in our feudal democracy. Of course, the only unjust thing that the Dynasty did was to have left out poor Sanjay Gandhi!

Non-dynasty greats can wait, may even die, there is no hurry. But, dynasty-scions, great or otherwise, can't be made to wait: two allowed themselves to be awarded Bharat Ratna when they were themselves in

power—Nehru in 1955 and Indira Gandhi in 1971—while Rajiv Gandhi was awarded the same soon after his death in 1991!! When sounded for Bharat Ratna, Maulana Azad declined and told Nehru it was totally improper for those deciding on the awards to pin the medal on themselves! Azad got it posthumously.

### NEHRU & NETAJI SUBHAS MYSTERY

Dynacracy, that is, Dynastic Democracy, is unfair, and is against the spirit of the constitution. It discounts merit and prevents competent from rising. The quality of leadership emerging out of a dynastic process can never really be good. Please also check Blunder#99. Yet another major negative of Dynacracy is that it suppresses truth. Continuance of the dynacracy requires that the halo be maintained. That requires hiding the ugly, and highlighting the positive—the latter is mostly manufactured. Both hiding the ugly and highlighting the manufactured positive requires continued suppression of truth. Among the biggest suppression of truth by Nehru and his Dynasty is the 'Netaji Subhas Death Mystery', prompting Anuj Dhar to title his book on the subject as 'India's Biggest Cover-up'.{AD}

#### CONGRESS-NEHRU'S CRASH CLAIM

It was claimed that Netaji Subhas had perished in a plane crash in Taipei on 18 August 1945; and that his ashes are enshrined in Tokyo's Renkoji temple. This was the version accepted by Nehru and the Congress, and was the conclusion of the first two Enquiry Commissions on Netaji, who had conveniently endorsed the government's position, or rather deliberate misinformation.

Reportedly, a Mitsubishi Ki-21 heavy bomber took off from Saigon airport at 2 pm on 17 August 1945. The bomber was being used for transportation, but it had no seats (it didn't have parachutes either). Passengers had to squat on floor on cushions. Inside the bomber were 13 people, including Netaji Bose and Lt Gen Tsunamasa Shidei of the Imperial Japanese Army. Bose was accompanied by his ADC and INA's Deputy Chief of Staff Lt Colonel Habibur Rahman.

The plane landed for refuelling in Taihoku, Formosa (now Taipei, Taiwan), after an overnight halt in Vietnam. Moments after the flight took off after refuelling on 18 August 1945, passengers heard a loud 'bang'. Ground crew saw the portside engine fall off, and the plane crashed. The pilots and Lt Gen Shidei died instantly. Rahman, who miraculously survived, recalled that Netaji was doused in a splash of petrol when the plane crashed, and his clothes subsequently caught fire. Netaji was badly burnt, was taken to hospital, but passed away a few hours later, unable to survive his burn-injuries.

But, is the above story true?

### WHY CRASH CLAIM APPEARS DUBIOUS

No Official Confirmation

Though Nehru had repeatedly reiterated the crash-claim, there was no official confirmation either by Britain (in power then) or by the subsequent Indian government.

"You ask me to send you proof of the death of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. I cannot send you any precise and direct proof." *—Nehru to Suresh Bose in 1962.*

Dead Body?

How come Netaji's other colleagues, who were to follow him on another flight, never saw his body? Why were no photographs taken of Netaji's injured state or his body in the hospital? Why was no death certificate issued?

Biography of an INA recruiting officer

An article in Mumbai Mirror of 28 August 2005 titled "*Nehru ditched Bose!* " {Art} , based on a biography of Dr VJ Dhanan, an INA recruiting officer, says that Bose had not died in that so-called air-crash on 18 August 1945 in Taiwan. The story was a concoction by the Japanese to keep Bose safe in exile. Soviet diplomats had claimed that Bose was in Russia.

Sardar Patel's Response

Ahmed Jaffer asked Sardar Patel, the then Home Minister in the Interim Government, on 31 October 1946 meeting whether the government had evidence on the death of Bose. Patel's laconic reply was: "No!" When pressed further, Patel replied: "The government are not in a position to

make any authoritative statement on the subject." When Patel was confronted with Nehru's definitive statement that Bose had died, Patel reiterated that the government had no view in the matter either way.

Claims of Netaji's Close Relatives

Sarat Chandra Bose, the elder brother of Netaji, broke his two-year silence—during which he had been investigating the matter—over the reported death of Netaji, by stating in late 1947: "*Subhash is alive and Jawaharlal knows it* ." Sarat lived with this conviction till his death in 1950.

Emilie Schenkl, Netaji's wife, refused to buy the story of 'death by plane crash'. Indeed, Emilie was so much against the said story that she refused to meet Pranab Mukherjee in 1995, the then External Affairs Minister, when he had approached her to discuss the possibility of transferring Subhas's 'ashes' from Tokyo's Renkoji temple to India.

Letter from Bose to Nehru & Letter by Nehru to Attlee

Reportedly, Viceroy Wavell had mentioned that Nehru had received a letter from Bose *after the date of his reported death* . As per the submission made by one Mr Shyamlal Jain of Meerut to the Khosla Commission, that was setup in 1970, he was called by Nehru to Asif Ali's residence with typewriter on 26/27 December 1945 (Netaji reportedly died on 18-Aug), and was given a letter to type—the following letter:{Nag}{URL56}

Mr Clements Attlee British Prime Minister 10 Downing Street, London

Dear Mr Attlee,

I understand from most reliable source that *Subhas Chandra Bose, your war criminal* , has been allowed to enter Russian territory by Stalin. This is a clear treachery and betrayal of faith by the Russians as Russia has been an ally of the British-Americans, which she should not have done.

Please take care of it and do what you consider proper and fit.

Yours sincerely,

Jawaharlal Nehru

The above letter is a proof Bose did not die in the air-crash, and that Nehru knew it! What is, however, worth noting and shocking are the use of

words "...Bose, your war criminal..." by Nehru in the above letter. Clearly shows Nehru's disdain for Netaji and his insulting attitude. For Nehru, Bose was not a patriot who gave his all to the nation, he was a war criminal, meant to be treated as such!

Justice Mukherjee Commission [JMC]'s Categorical Statement

As per a report in 'Outlook': "The Taiwan Government has informed the one-man Netaji Commission of Inquiry that there was no air crash at Taihoku on August 18, 1945, till date believed to have killed Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Disclosing this to newspersons after a routine hearing of the [Justice Mukherjee] Commission [JMC] here, Justice MK Mukherjee said that the Taiwan Government has confirmed to the Commission during its recent visit to that country that no plane crashed at Taihoku between August 14 and September 20, 1945."{URL57}

Declassified Files on Snooping

Most of the 64 files declassified by the West Bengal government on 18 September 2015 relate to snooping on the family members of Netaji. Their contents clearly establish that the Indian government as well as several foreign governments connected with Netaji believed Subhas was still alive, and that he had not perished in the plane-crash.

#### ENQUIRY COMMISSIONS

(1) Shah Nawaj Committee (SNC) or Netaji Inquiry Committee (NIC), 1956

"*I have no doubt in my mind—I did not have it then and I have no doubt today of the fact of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's death... There can be no enquiry about that* ."

> —Nehru in reply to a question put in the Parliament by HV Kamath on 5 March 1952.

Nehru did his best for a decade to stall all enquiries into the death of Netaji. But, when he could fend it off no longer, he decided to set up a committee that would give a report as he desired. A committee headed by Shah Nawaz Khan (24 January 1914 – 9 December 1983), a Congress MP and a former Lieutenant Colonel of INA, was appointed in 1956. Its other members were SN Maitra, ICS, nominated by the West Bengal Government, and Suresh Chandra Bose, a non-political elder brother of Netaji. The committee came to be known as the Shah Nawaj Committee

(SNC) or the Netaji Inquiry Committee (NIC). SNC-NIC interviewed 67 witnesses in India, Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam between April and July 1956. The interviewees included the reported survivors of the alleged plane crash, one of whom was INA's Lt Colonel Habibur Rahman, who had since joined the Pakistan military establishment.

Two members of the NIC, Shah Nawaz Khan and SN Maitra, concluded Bose had died in the plane crash. However, Suresh Chandra Bose, the third member, differed, did not believe so and submitted a dissenting note. He claimed that certain crucial evidence was withheld from him, and that he was pressurized by the other members and also by the then WB Chief Minister BC Roy to sign the final report. Suresh Bose alleged: "My colleagues, both connected with the Government, have tried their utmost to secure and manipulate the evidence, so that it could easily conform with the Prime Minister's statements." Incidentally, Shah Nawaz Khan held various ministerial posts between 1952 and 1977. Was he bought over?

### (2) Khosla Commission 1970-74

Owing to persistent doubts and pressure from many quarters, a one-man commission of enquiry headed by a retired Chief Justice of the Punjab High Court, GD Khosla, was set up in 1970. It submitted its report in 1974. Justice Khosla concurred with the earlier report of the Shah Nawaz Committee on the main facts of Bose's death.

Justice Mukherjee Commission (please see below) was dismayed by the sheer negligence of the Khosla Commission in omitting to pursue several crucial leads Dr Satyanarain Sinha had provided to unravel the Netaji mystery.

(3) Justice Mukherjee Commission (JMC) of Inquiry 1999-2005

Justice Mukherjee Commission of Inquiry was set up in 1999 during the Vajpayee's NDA regime, following a Calcutta High Court Order. It was headed by a retired Supreme Court Judge Manoj Kumar Mukherjee. The commission studied hundreds of files on Bose's death drawn from several countries and visited Japan, Russia and Taiwan. It submitted its report in 2005. The Commission's conclusions were several:

(1)The oral accounts on the plane crash were not reliable.

(2)Bose had NOT died in the alleged plane-crash. Thanks to the cooperation extended by Taiwan, it could be confirmed by the JMC that no

air-crash took place on 18 August 1945! The US state department too had corroborated the fact of no air-crash in Taiwan on that day.

(3)The plane-crash was a ruse to allow safe escape of Bose by Japan and Taiwan. There was a secret plan to ensure Bose's safe passage to the USSR with the knowledge of the Japanese authorities and Habibur Rahman (who had testified on the plane crash). As per the Report: "...On a conspectus of all the facts and circumstances relevant to the above issues it stands established that emplaning at Saigon on August 17, 1945 Netaji succeeded in evading the Allied Forces and escaping out of their reach and as a camouflage thereof the entire make-believe story of the air crash, Netaji's death therein and his cremation was engineered by the Japanese army authorities including the two doctors and Habibur Rahman and then aired on August 23, 1945..."

(4)The Indian government subsequently came to know of the escape, but chose to suppress the report.

(5)The ashes kept at the Renkoji temple in Japan, reported to be Bose's, were of Ichiro Okura, a Japanese soldier who died of cardiac arrest.

(6)JMC asked for a thorough probe into the Russian connection that contends that Bose had been detained in a Siberian camp.

(7)JMC couldn't find any evidence that "Gumnami Baba"/Bhagwanji, a monk who lived in Faridabad until his death in 1985, was Bose in disguise. (However, later Justice Mukherjee had commented: "It is my personal feeling…But I am 100 per cent sure that he is Netaji.")

The Action Taken Report (ATR) was tabled in the Parliament on 17 May 2006 during UPA-I by Minister of State for Home S Regupathy along with the JMC Report. The ATR mentioned, inter alia, that the government had examined the Commission's report submitted to it on 8 November 2005 "in detail and has not agreed with the findings that Netaji did not die in a plane crash and the ashes in the Renkoji Temple were not of Netaji." Expectedly, the Commission's report was rejected by the government without assigning any specific reasons—it being UPA-I/Congress Govt.

Reportedly, the Commission did not receive cooperation from either the Indian government or the foreign countries it visited, except Taiwan. The hostile posture of the British, Russian, Japanese and Indian governments was intriguing and indicative of an international conspiracy to suppress the truth. The Indian government refused to share many important files and

documents with the JMC under the pretext of them being sensitive. Disappointed, the JMC was forced to submit its unfinished work to the then Congress home minister Shivraj Patil.

### WAS 'BHAGWANJI' OR 'GUMNAMI BABA' SUBHAS?

Gumnami Baba, aka Bhagwanji, was a monk who lived in Lucknow, Faizabad, Sitapur, Basti and Ayodhya in UP for over 30 years till his death on 16 September 1985. He maintained contact with Dr Pavitra Mohan Roy, the former top Secret Service agent of the INA.

Personal effects (German binoculars, Gold-rimmed spectacles identical to that of Subhas, Bengali books, the original copy of the summons issued to Suresh Chandra Bose to appear before the Khosla Commission, an album containing family photographs of Netaji Subhas, newspaper clippings about Netaji's 'death' probe, letters from Netaji's followers, and so on) left behind by Bhagwanji seem to indicate he was perhaps Bose himself! Bhagwanji's birth date was 23rd January, the same as Netaji's.

The Mukherjee Commission had referred the handwriting samples of Bhagwanji and Bose to Dr B Lal, a forensic expert. His report was that the two matched! As per a report in ToI{W.ih6} : "A leading American handwriting expert has concluded that Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose lived in India for several decades after Independence, under the identity of a ascetic, Gumnami Baba... The expert, Carl Baggett, reached his conclusion after studying letters written by both Bose and Gumnami Baba."{W.ih6}

How come the government took no steps to ascertain the truth when Bhagwanji was alive? Or, in case it did, why has it been secretive about it? What was the government's relationship with Bhagwanji?

Why nothing was done to get at the truth even after Bhagwanji's death, especially after personal effects of the deceased pointed to his being perhaps Netaji? And, in case the truth was already known or was found out, why was it not made public? Why was Bhagwanji not rehabilitated or welcomed as Netaji? Why were even his relatives kept in the dark?

Why did Bhagwanji prefer to remain unknown or "Gumnami"? What were his constraints that he didn't wish to reveal his real self?

How could such a tragedy unfold for one of the greatest sons of India, even as his compatriots and political leaders remained mute, indifferent witnesses for decades?

#### NEHRU & NETAJI'S STOLEN WAR CHEST

No freedom fighter could raise as much amount as Netaji Subhas did. He appealed to the patriotism of an estimated two million Indians in erstwhile British colonies conquered by his Japanese allies for donations to finance his government-in-exile and the Indian National Army (INA). Netaji's personality, his emotive speeches and his unswerving commitment to Indian independence moved the diaspora. Numerous housewives gave away their gold in the cause of freedom. Reportedly, one Habib Sahib gifted all his property of over a crore of rupees; and VK Chelliah Nadar, a Rangoonbased businessman and an INA funder, deposited Rs 42 crores and 2,800 gold coins in the Azad Hind Bank!

After Rangoon, where Azad Hind Bank was headquartered, fell to the Allies in 1945, Netaji retreated to Bangkok on 24 April 1945 carrying with him the treasury, including gold bars and ornaments, in steel boxes. Japan surrendered to the Allied Powers on 15 August 1945, and the 40,000-strong INA followed suit. On 18 August 1945 Netaji boarded a Japanese bomber in Saigon bound for Manchuria, carrying the INA treasure, along with his aide Habibur Rahman. The plane reportedly crashed in Taiwan. The retrieved treasure from the crash site was handed over by the Japanese army to SA Ayer and M Rama Murti of the IIL (Indian Independence League which had come under Netaji) at Tokyo.

Local Indians in Tokyo suspected that Rama Murti and SA Aiyer had jointly defalcated the INA treasure—there was enough circumstantial evidence. Inexplicably, India did nothing to get back the treasure, and rather than setting up an enquiry or hauling up Murti and Aiyer, the government absorbed Aiyer as a director of publicity with the Bombay state, while Murti lead an affluent life-style in Tokyo, in sharp contrast to the devastation all around.

Sir Benegal Rama Rau, the first head of the Indian liaison mission in Tokyo, wrote to the MEA (Ministry of External Affairs), headed by the PM Nehru himself, in India on 4 December 1947 alleging that the INA treasure had been embezzled by Murti. Strangely, the MEA responded it could not be interested in the INA funds! It seems it wasn't just a case of indifference, it was much more than that.

KK Chettur, who headed the Tokyo mission/embassy during 1951-52, took up the matter of misappropriation of the INA treasure vigorously. (Incidentally, Jaya Jaitley is Chettur's daughter. She has penned an excellent, worth-reading article "#NehruSnooped: Truth behind Netaji files" in the connection.{URL67} ) In response, the government sent SA Aiyer on a secret mission to Tokyo. He advised collection of the retrieved treasury from Murti saying it was in his safe custody. Chettur suspected Aiyer-Murti collusion in returning part amount just to close the matter. He recommended to the government a thorough probe in the matter on 22 June 1951. But, nothing came of it. The Indian embassy collected whatever there was at Murti's residence as the INA treasure in October 1951. The same was secretly brought into India from Japan, and was also inspected by Nehru who reportedly made a snide comment: "poor show". Nehru quoted from Aiyer's report in the parliament in 1952 affirming Netaji's death in an air crash in Taipei. Aiyer was later appointed adviser, integrated publicity programme, for the Five Year Plan.

RD Sathe, an undersecretary in the MEA, wrote a two-page secret note on 1 November 1951 titled "INA Treasures and their handling by Messrs Ayer and Ramamurthi" pointing out the circumstances of the mysterious disappearance of the massive INA treasure and the highly suspicious role of Aiyar-Murti duo; and the token return of a paltry portion from it that raised even more questions. Sathe's note was signed by Jawaharlal Nehru on 5 November 1951 in token of having read it.{AD} But, like the earlier notes of Rau and Chettur, Sathe's note too was just filed away by the Nehru's government. However, the matter refused to die.

The Indian ambassador in Tokyo, AK Dar, sent a four-page secret note to the MEA in 1955 advocating a public inquiry into the matter of the disappearance of the INA treasure. He opined that even if the government was not able to get the treasure back, at least the culprits or the likely culprits would be known. He further said that the government's 10-year long indifference in the matter had not only helped the guilty party escape,

but had done injustice to the great work and sacrifice of Netaji. Even the Shah Nawaz Committee set up in 1956 to probe Netaji's disappearance had recommended an inquiry into all the assets of Netaji's government-in-exile including the INA treasure.

Yet Nehru did nothing! And, that's baffling. It was not a small amount. The total treasure, had it been recovered, would have been worth several hundred crore rupees today. Was Nehru's government protecting the embezzlers? Why did Nehru's government accommodate a suspect embezzler SA Aiyar in the government service, and even depute him on a secret mission, as mentioned above? Was Aiyar's report confirming death of Netaji a quid-pro-quo? Was Nehru afraid Aiyar-Murti duo may spill the beans on the alleged fiction of Netaji's death in the air-crash if they were hauled up? Anuj Dhar's book on the subject 'India's Biggest Cover-up'{AD} is worth reading.

#### GROSS ILL-TREATMENT OF INA

The Indian National Army (INA) or the Azad Hind Fauj was an armed force formed by Indian nationalists under the leadership of Netaji Subhas Bose in Southeast Asia during World War II to secure Indian independence. "Jai Hind" was coined by Netaji and later adopted by the Government of India and the Indian Armed Forces.

There are reasonable grounds to believe that the Subhas Bose INA's military onslaught on the British and the INA Red Fort trials of 1945-46 and its consequences (mutinies in the armed forces) were a major factor in the British decision to quit India, and not the Quit India movement (which had petered off in 1942 in a few months) of Congress. For details, please check Blunder#12.

Yet, Nehru and Congress had all through opposed Subhas and INA. A lot is made of Nehru donning his lawyer's robes to fight for INA soldiers in their trial by the British in 1945. The reality was that elections were imminent, and INA and Bose being the people's favourites, Congress and Nehru wanted to get cheap popularity by projecting themselves as pro-INA.

Says Anuj Dhar in 'India's Biggest Cover-up'{AD} : "Captain Badhwar reported that the Congress leaders' turnaround had little to do with any love for their ousted former president [Bose] or the people who fought under his command...He [Asaf Ali—CWC member] travelled across India and discovered that people were overwhelmingly in support of the INA. 'This inflamed feeling forced Congress to take the line it did,' Badhwar said...Ali was positive that as and when Congress came to power, they 'would have no hesitation in removing all INA from the Services and even in putting some of them to trial.'...The top Congress leadership's duplicitous disapproval of Bose and INA was exposed by numerous pre-1947 statements made by its leaders, especially Nehru."{AD}

Strangely, but expectedly, while Nehru made a big show of being a part of the Defence Committee to defend the INA veterans Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon, and Major General Shah Nawaz Khan (for the sake of votes in the ensuing elections) in the Red Fort Trials of 1945–46, after independence Nehru as PM refused to reinstate them in the army—hypocrisy unlimited!

As expected from Nehru and the Congress, rather that honouring and rewarding them, the INA-veterans were debarred from the Indian Army by the Government of independent India! Why? Because, that was the way the British and Mountbatten wanted, as INA soldiers had fought against them. And, Nehru being an anglophile and a chela of his guru Mountbatten, faithfully carried out the British bidding. Reportedly, Mountbatten (as Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia then) even went to the extent of dynamiting the INA Memorial in Singapore in 1945.

The above was in sharp contrast to Jinnah who had inducted Muslim INA soldiers into the Pakistani army.

The INA personnel remained ineligible for the Freedom Fighters Pension till 1972. Captain Ram Singh Thakur (1914–2002) was an INA soldier of Nepali origin. He was also a musician and a composer. His famous patriotic compositions include "Kadam Badhaye Ja, khushi k ē geet g āē j ā , y ē z ī ndagi hai qâum k ī , t ū qâum p ē l ū t āē j ā ..." and "Subh Sukh Chain". His final years were difficult. He was also initially denied the status of a freedom fighter by the government.

### ILL-TREATMENT OF NETAJI BOSE

Apart from dragging its feet in instituting an enquiry into Netaji's death, manipulating the enquiry report (Blunder#112), being hostile to INA (Blunder#114), and not recognising Netaji for Bharat Ratna (Blunder#111), Nehru's Government had been so hostile that in 1947 it refused to put up Netaji's portrait in the Parliament House. In a confidential memo dated 11 February 1949 under the signature of Major General PN Khandoori the government recommended: "The photos of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose be NOT displayed at prominent places, Unit Lines, Canteens, Quarter Guards or Recreation rooms."{URL58}

By burying India's true national freedom hero in the pages of history, Nehru, the Congress, and the "eminent" Marxist-Nehruvian Sarkari historians demonstrated unpardonable ingratitude. The book 'Judgment: No Aircrash No Death'{MA} , co-authored by Lt Manwati Arya of the Rani Jhansi Regiment of the erstwhile INA, details how Nehru had coldshouldered all attempts at unearthing the truth behind Netaji Subhas's death; and how the Nehru government left no stone unturned to banish all records of contributions of Netaji's contribution. In her book, Lt. Manwati Arya says that during her talks in All India Radio (AIR), *she was briefed by her programme producers, without fail, about the national policy against any reference to the INA, including the name of Netaji* . {URL58}

This is from the foreword of S Nijalingappa to the book, 'Inside Story of Sardar Patel—The Diary of Maniben Patel: 1936-50': "Strangely, however, while the collected works of many other leaders [notably, Nehru and Gandhi] have been published by the government since Independence, the collected or selected works of two foremost leaders, namely Sardar Patel and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, were never taken up by any official agency..."{Mani}

#### ILL-TREATMENT OF BHAGAT SINGH & AZAD

Despite popular requests to make sparing the life of Shahid Bhagat Singh and others a condition in the on-going negotiations between Gandhi and the

Viceroy Irwin, the Gandhi–Irwin Pact signed on 5 March 1931 remained silent on the matter, and Gandhi and the Congress under Nehru as President did effectively precious little to save the braves. Revolutionary Sukhdev, who had not pleaded for himself and his colleagues, wrote an open letter to Gandhi in March 1931 after the Gandhi-Irwin Pact:

"Since your compromise (Gandhi-Irwin pact) you have called off your movement and consequently all of your prisoners have been released. But, what about the revolutionary prisoners? Dozens of Ghadar Party prisoners imprisoned since 1915 are still rotting in jails; in spite of having undergone the full terms of their imprisonments, scores of martial law prisoners are still buried in these living tombs, and so are dozens of Babbar Akali prisoners. Deogarh, Kakori, Machhua Bazar and Lahore Conspiracy Case prisoners are amongst those numerous still locked behind bars. More than half a dozen conspiracy trials are going on at Lahore, Delhi, Chittagong, Bombay, Calcutta and elsewhere. Dozens of revolutionaries are absconding and amongst them are many females. More than half a dozen prisoners are actually waiting for their executions. What about all of these people? The three Lahore Conspiracy Case condemned prisoner (Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru), who have luckily come into prominence and who have acquired enormous public sympathy, do not form the bulk of the revolutionary party…"{URL60}

The above letter had no effect on Gandhi. The British India Viceroy Lord Irwin recorded in his notes dated 19 March 1931:

"While returning Gandhiji asked me if he could talk about the case of Bhagat Singh, because newspapers had come out with the news of his slated hanging on March 24th. It would be a very unfortunate day because on that day the new president of the Congress had to reach Karachi and there would be a lot of hot discussion. I explained to him that I had given a very careful thought to it but I did not find any basis to convince myself to commute the sentence. It appeared he found my reasoning weighty."{URL71}

From the above it appears Gandhi was bothered more about the embarrassment that would be faced by the Congress with Bhagat Singh's hanging than by the hanging itself. The British "justice" system could allow the British mass-murderer of Jallianwala Bagh to get away scot free, and the British could even generously reward him for that brutality; but people like Bhagat Singh who protested against those brutal acts deserved to be

hanged; and Gandhi's abstruse artefact (was it deliberately abstruse to allow for self-serving flexibility!) of "non-violence" was comfortable with such a position! Gandhi wrote in Young India the following after Bhagat Singh's martyrdom: "This mad worship of Bhagat Singh has done and is doing incalculable harm to the country. Caution has been thrown to the winds, and the deed of murder is being worshipped as if it was worthy of emulation. The result is brigandage and degradation."

Gandhi used to report back each day's discussions and agreements with Irwin to the CWC members in the evening; and all agreements were with their concurrence. If Gandhi and the CWC had so desired they could have refused to further proceed with the talks with the Viceroy if he was not agreeable to deal with Shahid Bhagat Singh and colleagues differently. Nehru was the Congress president then, serving his second consecutive term. As Nehru was young then and used to pose as a firebrand leftistsocialist freedom fighter, people had tremendous hope from him that he would leave no stone unturned to save Shahid Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev. But, Nehru did nothing.

Chandrashekhar Azad had met Nehru secretly at Nehru's residence 'Anand Bhavan' at Allahabad in February 1931 to know if Gandhi and the Congress would do something in the ongoing Gandhi-Irwin talks to save Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev from gallows. Rather than doing what Nehru should have, what Nehru wrote about his meeting with Chandrashekhar Azad in his autobiography is not just disappointing, it is disturbing. The casual, disrespectful way he wrote about Chandrashekhar Azad is shocking. Here are some extracts:

"I remember a curious incident about that time, which gave me an insight into the mind of the terrorist group [How he calls them: not freedom fighters, but terrorists!] in India… A stranger came to see me at our house, and I was told that he was Chandrasekhar Azad [even though Azad was famous by then, and there is no way Nehru wouldn't have known him]… He had been induced to visit me because of the general expectation (owing to our release) that some negotiations between the Government and the Congress were likely. He wanted to know, if, in case of a settlement, his group of people would have any peace. Would they still be considered and treated as outlaws; hunted from one place to place, with a price on their heads, and the prospect of the gallows ever before them? [Would people like Azad plead like this?]…"{JN2}{URL39}

Chandrashekhar Azad had shot himself with his last bullet at the Alfred Park in Allahabad on 27 February 1931, after he was surrounded, and had valiantly defended himself and his colleague. An informer had tipped the police. Incidentally, as described above Azad had met Nehru earlier at 'Anand Bhavan'.

#### ILL-TREATMENT OF VEER SAVARKAR

Savarkar's case is unique, shocking, and painful for all patriots, and wellmeaning people. He suffered the most and brutally in the British jails (Kaalapani). As if that was not enough, independent India under Nehru again threw him into jail by framing a false case, and defamed him!

What did Savarkar get for all his sacrifices? Humiliation! It was doubly humiliating because the humiliation was inflicted not by the British, but by Independent India—that too by framing false charges against him. What could be worse? Top Gandhian leaders who suffered the least in the British jails (Blunder#13) leveraged all their "sacrifices" to grab power and pelf post-independence, but people like Savarkar who gave their all (and who were far more erudite, wise and capable than most top Gandhians) were humiliated, defamed, ignored and forgotten.

Vinayak Damodar Savarkar (1883–1966), aka Swatantryaveer Savarkar, was a freedom fighter, poet, writer, playwright, forceful orator, rationalist, atheist, and reformer, who vigorously advocated end of Hindu caste-system, and strongly disapproved of orthodox Hindu beliefs and practices. He built the Patit Pavan Mandir in Ratnagiri, open to the all, including Dalits. A section of orthodox Brahmins of Maharashtra opposed his reform; but he earned praise and respect from Dr BR Ambedkar. Savarkar was a multitalented personality, who had also coined the terms that have been in common usage since: 'Chitrapat', 'Doordarshan', 'Nirdeshak', 'Sampadak', 'Mahapaur', 'Parshad', etc.

Savarkar became a revolutionary while a student in India and England. In London, he was associated with the 'India House' set up by the revolutionary Shyamji Krishna Varma. He founded 'Abhinav Bharat Society' and the 'Free India Society'. He also brought out publications espousing the cause of complete independence of India by revolutionary

means. His famous book '1857—First War of Independence' had so much rattled the British that they had put a ban on it, confiscating all its copies within six months of its release.

Arrested in 1910 for his revolutionary activities, he made a daring attempt to escape while being transported from Marseilles, France. With constable waiting outside, Savarkar entered the toilet, broke the window, wriggled out somehow, and jumped into the ocean from a sailing ship to swim his way to Marseilles port. His friends (including Madam Bhikaiji Cama) were supposed to pick him up there, but they were late by a few minutes, and the French Police caught him and returned him to the British cops—chained and under stricter watch.

He was sentenced to two life terms of imprisonment totalling fifty years! He was imprisoned in the Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (Kaalapani), and treated cruelly and inhumanly—in sharp contrast to the VIP treatment accorded to Gandhi, Nehru, and the top Gandhians in jails. He must have been the first poet in the world to have been deprived of pen and paper in a jail—while Nehru wrote all his books in jails, having been provided with liberal and conducive facilities by the British jailers. Savarkar improvised and used thorns and nails to compose his writings on prison walls.

Notably, VD Savarkar's elder brother, Babarao Savarkar, was also a revolutionary who was lodged in the Cellular Jail in Kaalapani. His younger brother too was a revolutionary. It was a family of brave patriots and revolutionaries.

Shahid Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Chandrashekhar Azad were admirers of the Savarkar family, and drew inspiration from them. Revolutionary Madanlal Dhingra who shot Sir Wyllie in London in 1909 after a failed assassination attempt on the then Viceroy Lord Curzon was a keen follower of Savarkar.

Savarkar was elected president of the Hindu Mahasabha in 1937, and served in that post till 1943. After the Muslim League's Pakistan Resolution of 1940 Savarkar could foresee the problems ahead for Hindus in India, and wanted Hindus to be militarily well-equipped. Therefore, rather than the 'Quit India 1942', Savarkar gave a call to the Hindus to take advantage of the opportunity of getting militarily trained by joining the army in the British war effort in WW-II. Fortunately, a very large number of Hindus

responded to Savarkar's call, and joined the British army—finally making it Hindu-majority from its earlier position of Muslim-majority. That helped tremendously after partition and independence, providing a large army to India, the Muslims in the army having mostly opted for Pakistan. Unlike Gandhi and Nehru, Savarkar knew what a country of the size of India needed to defend itself. Dr Ziauddin Ahmed, the then VC of AMU, had indeed raised an alarm on the increasing number of Hindus enlisting in the armed forces, thereby reducing the proportion of Muslims. But for Savarkar's whirlwind recruitment drive during WW-II, Pakistan, after partition, would have had 60–70% of the soldiers, enough to overwhelm India in the border areas in a conflict—this debt to Savarkar is sadly unacknowledged.

'Quit India', which Savarkar opposed, fetched nothing for India or the Congress in real terms, fizzled out in two months, and proved counterproductive (for details, please check Blunder#12, and the book "Sardar Patel: The Best PM India Never Had" available on Amazon)—while it drove the British to be fiercely anti-India, anti-Hindu, and anti-Congress; it made them even more pro-Muslim, pro-Muslim League and pro-Pakistan, which ultimately resulted in the tragedy of Partition.

Hindu Mahasabha activists protested Gandhi holding talks with Jinnah in 1944, denouncing it as appeasement. Savarkar considered Gandhi a naive leader and a sissy. He stated that although Gandhi "babbled compassion and forgiveness", he "has a very narrow and immature head".

Savarkar was years ahead of Gandhi-Nehru on many counts. Gandhi, Nehru and the Congress gave a call for complete independence for India very late at the end of 1929, what Savarkar had called for way back in 1900! Bonfire of foreign clothes on which the Gandhians claim copyright was performed much earlier by Savarkar in 1905, later copied by Gandhi. Upon creation of Pakistan, Savarkar had rightly predicted: "Till a nation based on religious fanaticism exists beside India she won't ever be able to live in peace."

In the 1930s and later, when the Muslims of East Bengal (now Bangladesh) began migrating to Brahmaputra valley in Assam for livelihood, pooh-poohing the grave warnings from sane quarters, pseudosecular, naive Nehru made an irresponsible statement: "Nature abhors vacuum, meaning where there is open space how can one prevent people

from settling there?" Savarkar responded with his masterly prediction: "Nature also abhors poisonous gas. The migration of such large numbers of Muslims in Assam threatened not just the local culture but would also prove to be a national security problem for India on its north-east frontier."

Savarkar, in a statement on 19 December 1947, heartily supported an independent Jewish state; and demanded restoration to the Jews their entire historical holy land and Fatherland of Palestine. Terming it as an appeasement to Muslims by Nehru, he expressed regret at India's vote against the creation of the Jewish state at the UN (Blunder#54).

Noting China's invasion of Tibet in 1950, and Nehru's weak-kneed policy, Savarkar had predicted in 1954 itself: "After what China has done to Tibet, kowtowing to the Chinese would whet its appetite. I won't be surprised if China feels emboldened to swallow Indian land tempted by India's weak-kneed approach."

Savarkar became a fierce critic of the Indian National Congress. No wonder an all-out attempt was made to falsely implicate him in the Gandhi Murder Case. Manohar Malgaonkar, after extensive research, published 'The Men Who Killed Gandhi'{Mal} in 1977. He does not point to any guilt on Savarkar's part. Here is an extract from the author's introduction in the book:

"...Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar's secret assurance to Mr. L.B. Bhopatkar, that his client, Mr V.D. Savarkar had been implicated as a murder-suspect on the flimsiest grounds. Then again, certain other pertinent details such as the 'doctoring' of a confession by a magistrate whose duty it was only to record what was said only came out in later years..."

## Malgaokar's book also states:{Mal}

"...Why were the police so anxious to implicate Savarkar? Was it merely that, having failed in their proper function to arrest Nathuram before he killed Gandhi, they were making a bid to save face by raising the bogey of some sensational plot which involved a big leader who, providentially happened to be in bad odour with the government of the day? Or was that government itself, or some powerful group in it, using the police agency to destroy a rival political organization or at least to destroy a fiercely uncompromising opposition stalwart?

"Or, again, was the whole thing a manifestation of some form of phobia peculiar to India, religious, racial, linguistic, or provincial, that made

Savarkar a natural target for the venom of some section of society?

"...Savarkar being made an accused in the Gandhi-murder trial may well have been an act of political vendetta. Of course, Badge [approver who implicated Savarkar], on his track record is a slippery character and not to be relied upon, but he was most insistent to me that he had been forced to tell lies, and that his pardon and future stipend by the police department in Bombay depended upon his backing the official version of the case and, in particular that, he never saw Savarkar talking to Apte, and never heard him telling them: 'Yeshaswi houn ya.'

"...[Dr BR Ambedkar confided to Bhopatkar, Savarkar's lawyer:] 'There is no real charge against your client; quite worthless evidence has been concocted. Several members of the cabinet were strongly against it, but to no avail. Even Sardar Patel could not go against these orders. But, take it from me, there just is no case. You will win.'..."{Mal}

It seems Nehru leveraged the emotions against the assassination of Gandhi to fix Savarkar, and ensured that no one came in the way—not even senior cabinet colleagues: they must have been wary lest they be accused or defamed of trying to protect an accomplice in Gandhi-assassination.

Malgaokar's further wrote: {Mal}

"...He [Savarkar] was sixty-four years old, and had been ailing for a year or more. He was detained on 6 February 1948, and remained in prison for the whole of the year which the investigation and the trial took. He was adjudged 'not guilty' on 10 February 1949. The man who had undergone twenty-six years of imprisonment or detention under the British for his part in India's struggle for freedom was thus slung back into jail for another year the moment that freedom came..."

Appa Kasar, the bodyguard of Veer Savarkar was arrested by the police and tortured brutally—nails of his hands and toes were pulled out—to force his evidence against Savarkar.<sup>{W.n3}</sup>

It has been reported that in the wake of the assassination of Gandhi, and the rumours that got floated, a mob went on a rampage against Savarkar in Mumbai. Yet, the state government then under the Congress made no arrangements to ensure security for Savarkar (who was bed-ridden) and his kin. His family members and friends had to somehow defend his house using sticks when the mob attacked it. In the process, his younger brother Dr Narayanrao Savarkar (also a freedom fighter) was seriously injured, and later succumbed to his injuries.

Savarkar was arrested on 5 February 1948 but till 23 March (for 46 days) he was not allowed to meet his wife or his only son.{W.n3}

The 'democratic' and 'freedom-loving' 'cultured' Nehru tried to destroy all those who were opposed to him. Although the court acquitted Savarkar, he was so defamed that he could not rise again. After his acquittal, Savarkar was arrested by the government for making 'militant Hindu nationalist speeches', and was released after agreeing to give up political activities what then was the difference between the British India and Nehru's Independent India! Nehru had forbidden the Congress members to participate in any public function honouring Savarkar; and had refused to share the stage with him during the centenary celebrations of India's First War of Independence (which was called so for the first time by none other than Savarkar in his book that was banned by the British).

Savarkar renounced medicines, food and water with effect from 1 February 1966, terming it as atmaarpan (fast until death). He died on 26 February 1966. Not a single minister from the Maharashtra or Central Cabinet showed up at the cremation ground to pay homage to Savarkar. The Speaker of the Parliament turned down a request that it pay homage to Savarkar.

After the death of Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, as PM, approved payment of monthly pension to Savarkar, like it was done for other freedom fighters. In 1970, Indira Gandhi's government issued a postal stamp in honour of Veer Savarkar. The commemorative blue plaque on India House, London fixed by the Historic Building and Monuments Commission for England reads 'Vinayak Damodar Savarkar 1883-1966 Indian patriot and philosopher lived here'. The airport at Port Blair, the capital of Andaman & Nicobar, has since been named as Veer Savarkar International Airport. It was in February 2003 when the NDA government was in power that the portrait of Swatantryaveer Savarkar was put up in the Central Hall of Parliament—Congress Party MPs boycotted the function, without ever offering a public explanation for their disgraceful behaviour. There has been a demand that Savarkar should be conferred the Bharat Ratna posthumously.

ILL-TREATMENT OF SARDAR PATEL

On how Nehru usurped the positions that should rightfully have gone to Sardar Patel, please check Blunder#1 and Blunder#6 above. Despite those crafty usurpations that cost India dear, Nehru's machinations against Sardar Patel continued after independence.

Jayaprakash Narayan(JP), a socialist, used to be in Nehru's camp. After independence the socialists had been plotting to unseat Patel from his post as Home Minister. JP had commented: "A man of 74 [Sardar Patel] has the department of which even a man of 30 would find it difficult to bear the burden." Mridula Sarabhai, who was close to Nehru, had launched a whisper campaign for Sardar's resignation. It is difficult to believe that the campaigns of both JP and Mridula did not have the blessings of Nehru, both being close to him.{Mak/129}

Later, in 1972, JP regretted his actions: "Rajaji once unburdened his heart by publicly confessing to a wrong he had done to Sardar Patel. I find myself in a similar situation: the dominant feeling within me today is one of selfreproach, because during his lifetime, I was not merely a critic, but an opponent of the Great Sardar."{BK/243}

Wrote Brig. BN Sharma: "…he [Nehru] could be down-right petty to others. His silent encouragement of a whispering campaign branding Patel as fascist is too well known."{BNS/402}

After the death of Gandhi the only impediment to Nehru's dictatorship was Patel, and Nehru did all he could to dent his position. Patel's death had removed the only brake on Nehru. Nehru&Dynasty saw to it that Bharat Ratna was never awarded to Sardar Patel (Blunder#111).

When Sardar died in Mumbai, Nehru (who did attend the funeral), advised the then President, Dr Rajendra Prasad, to not attend the funeral{DD/305} —the reason given by him was that as per the protocol, President need not attend funerals of ministers! So he treated Sardar Patel as a mere minister—what arrogance! A disgraceful attitude, particularly when Sardar Patel had so selflessly supported him, even though Nehru had usurped the PM's post from him most undemocratically. But, of course, Rajendra Prasad went. Sardar was not just the Deputy PM, but was

Rajendra Prasad's colleague of many, many years in the Independence Struggle.

Wrote Stanley Wolpert: "Gandhi's death reunited Nehru and Patel. Their reconciliation not only saved Congress and India's central government from collapse, but it kept Nehru in power. Without the Sardar's strength and support Nehru might have broken down or been forced out of high office. Vallabhbhai ran India's administration for the next two years [before his death] while Nehru indulged mostly in foreign affairs and high Himalayan adventures."{Wolp2/433}

MKK Nair, an IAS officer who was close to both Sardar Patel and VP Menon, states in his book 'The Story of an Era Told Without Ill-will':

"Incessant differences of opinion between Nehru and Patel caused Nehru to treat Patel with personal animosity. If… Nehru was not above harbouring personal hatred, he would not have done two things he did on the day Patel died. He sent two orders to the Home Ministry and they arrived at V P Menon's desk. The first was that the Cadillac car that Patel used should be returned the very next morning to the Foreign Ministry. Patel died in Bombay. Nehru's second memo asked officers who wished to attend his funeral to travel at their own expense. VP Menon called officers of his Ministry and, without divulging Nehru's order, asked who all were interested to attend the funeral. About a dozen officers wanted to. He bought their air tickets at his expense. When Nehru learnt about it, he was annoyed even more."{MKN} {Adv/157}

The above was confirmed when KM Munshi wrote: "When Sardar died in Bombay, Jawaharlal issued a direction to the Ministers and Secretaries not to go to Bombay to attend the funeral. Among the Ministers, I was in Matheran (Bombay) at the time. Sri NV Gadgil, Sri Satyanarayan Sinha and Sri VP Menon disregarded the direction and attended the funeral. Jawaharlal also requested [President Dr] Rajendra Prasad not to go to Bombay; it was a strange request, to which Rajendra Prasad did not accede."{RNPS/45}

It is hard to believe the supposedly cultured person Nehru could be so ungracious and could go to such lengths upon death of a colleague and a great national leader and freedom fighter!

This is from the preface of 'Patel–A Life' by Rajmohan Gandhi {RG/ix} : "The establishment of independent India derived legitimacy and power, broadly speaking, from the exertions of three men, Gandhi, Nehru and Patel. But while its acknowledgements are fulsome in the case of Nehru and dutiful in case of Gandhi, they are niggardly in the case of Patel.

"'That there is today an India to think and talk about,' President Rajendra Prasad wrote in his diary on May 13, 1959, 'is very largely due to Sardar Patel's statesmanship and firm administration.' 'Yet,' added Prasad, 'we are apt to ignore him.'

"Falling in 1989, the centenary of Jawaharlal's birth found expression on a thousand billboards, in commemorative TV serials, in festivals and on numerous other platforms. Occurring on October 31, 1975 … the Patel centenary was, by contrast, wholly neglected by official India and by the rest of the Establishment, and since then the curtain drawn on the life of one of modern India's most remarkable sons has been occasionally and partially lifted…"{RG/ix}

In the capital, in the prime area, you have Rajghat for Gandhiji, Shanti Van for Nehru, Shakti Sthal for Indira Gandhi, Veer Bhumi for Rajiv Gandhi, Vijay Ghat for Shastri, Kishan Ghat for Charan Singh, besides many museums or memorials for the Nehru-Gandhis, but no memorial to either Subhas Bose or to Sardar Patel in the capital, when next to Gandhiji the latter two deserve the highest respect! The residence in Delhi where Sardar lived when he was the Deputy Prime Minister of the country has been razed and there is no sign that he had ever lived there. Nehru's house (Teen Murti), on the other hand, has been turned into a museum.

Nehru's meanness and small-mindedness can be gauged from the fact that he made NO arrangements to have a portrait of Sardar Patel put up in the Central Hall of Parliament, like it was done for other prominent leaders. Apparently, he saw to it that such a portrait was not put up—he had done the same in case of Netaji Subhas Bose. It was Maharaja Jivaji Rao Scindia of Gwalior, who had since become the first Rajpramukh of Madhya Bharat, who felt much irked by that glaring (and, apparently, deliberate) omission, and presented a Sardar Patel's portrait to be put up in the Central Hall of Parliament in 1954. The unveiling ceremony was performed by President Dr Rajendra Prasad.{BK/427}

This is from the foreword of S Nijalingappa to the book, 'Inside Story of Sardar Patel—The Diary of Maniben Patel: 1936-50'{Mani} : "Strangely,

however, while the collected works of many other leaders [notably, Nehru and Gandhi] have been published by the government since Independence, the collected or selected works of two foremost leaders, namely Sardar Patel and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, were never taken up by any official agency. It is for this reason that we constituted the Sardar Patel Society, had it registered, collected funds and published the Collected works of Sardar Patel in fifteen volumes..."{Mani}

#### ILL-TREATMENT OF SARDAR PATEL'S DAUGHTER MANIBEN

Maniben Patel, the only daughter of Sardar Patel, switched to khadi at a tender age of 16, and started working regularly at the Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad. Most of the garments that Sardar Patel wore after 1921 were woven out of the yarn made by Maniben. When just 17, she put all her gold bangles, earrings and other ornaments, gold wrist-watch, and jewels in a bundle of cloth and, after obtaining her father's nod, deposited them in the cause of freedom at the Gandhi Ashram.

Unlike Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi, Maniben was a freedom fighter, who actively participated in the non-cooperation movements. During the Bardoli Satyagraha in 1928, she along with many other ladies helped out in the camps. For her active role in the Salt Satyagraha of 1930 and thereafter she was arrested and imprisoned on several occasions. In January 1932, she was arrested along with Kasturba Gandhi for defying a ban on meetings in Bardoli. She was released in May 1932, but was re-arrested in July 1932 for defying a ban in Kheda, and was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment, which she spent in Belgaum jail. For her role in arousing people in the villages in Rajkot she was arrested in December 1938. Gandhi was much impressed with her work, and had remarked that Maniben was showing her mettle; and that he had not seen another daughter like her. During Maniben's stint in Sabarmati jail, Sardar Patel wrote to her daughter: "Look after all the other women prisoners, and see that they come out braver than when they went in…".{RG2/L-3423}

Under Gandhi's "Selective Disobedience", Maniben was arrested in December 1940 and sent to Belgaum jail. Released in May 1941, she again wished to court arrest, but Gandhi stopped her, looking to her frail health.

Later, Maniben underwent prolonged imprisonment during the Quit India Movement of 1942. She was arrested along with Kasturba Gandhi in August 1942, and was in detention at the Aga Khan's Palace in Pune, where Gandhi was lodged. Maniben was released in March 1944. But, she was rearrested in May 1944 in Bardoli in Gujarat, and was sent to Surat jail. From Surat she was sent to Yerwada jail.

The following is based on a telling episode about her described by Balraj Krishna{IFJ/9}{BK/494-5} :

Sardar Patel gave up his highly remunerative legal practice when he joined Gandhi in the independence struggle. He kept no property or savings. Even after independence, when he became the Deputy Prime Minister, he and his daughter Maniben continued with their austere life. After a massive heart attack, when Patel was convalescing at the Dehra Dun Circuit House, Mahavir Tyagi visited him.

Incidentally, Mahavir Tyagi (1899–1980) was a well-known parliamentarian from Dehra Dun. He was in the British Indian Army and was posted in Persia when he resigned upon the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre of 13 April 1919. He was court-martialled in Quetta, capital of Baluchistan, and externed from Baluchistan with all pay deposits forfeited. Returning home, Tyagi joined the freedom movement.

Seeing Maniben wearing a Khadi sari with a huge patch sewed over a torn portion, Mahavir Tyagi commented in good humour: "Maniben, you think yourself to be 'great', being the daughter of a man who has, within a year, established a far-flung 'Empire' [by merging the numerous Princely States]. Not so was [the Empire] of Rama or Krishna, or of Ashoka, Akbar, or of the British! As the daughter of one who is the 'Sardar' of big Rajas and Maharajas, don't you feel ashamed of wearing such a sari?... If you happen to go round my town, people will take you for a beggar and offer you some money."

Patel, joining in the fun, remarked: "The bazaar is full of people. By evening she will be able to collect a good amount."

Dr Sushila Nayyar then intervened: "Tyagi, Maniben spends the whole day in looking after Sardar Saheb. Then she has to find time to write her diary and spin yarn on the charkha. Of the yarn thus spun, clothes are stitched for Sardar Saheb, as he doesn't purchase cloth from Khadi

Bhandar. When his dhotis and kurtas are torn, Maniben makes her cloth out of them…"

Maniben didn't get married, and served her father till his death in 1950. Here is a shocking episode relating to Maniben based on various sources, mainly 'I too had a dream', an autobiography of Dr Verghese Kurien of Anand Dairy fame.{VK1}

Sardar Patel's wife, Jhaverba, had expired back in 1909, and he was being looked after by his daughter, Maniben, who chose not to get married. Maniben was a devoted patriot, and a dedicated Congress worker, who gave her all to the nation, and to the Freedom Struggle. Sardar Patel did not have any bank balances or property. Even though he was earning substantially as a very successful lawyer, once he got into the Freedom Movement, he gave up everything. Sardar was the very example of Gandhian simplicity. He used to say that, "Bapu has told that those in politics should not hold property, and I hold none." Such were the ideals then. Contrast this with the multi-crorepati leaders of today.

When Sardar Patel expired, he had left nothing for his daughter. With Sardar no more, she had to vacate the house. She was left all alone to fend for herself, with no money and no house. Sardar had instructed her to give a bag and a book to Nehru upon his death.

After Sardar's death—which happened in Mumbai—Maniben dutifully went to Delhi, took an appointment with Nehru and met him. She handed over to him the bag and the book. It seems the book was an account book, and the bag contained rupees 35 lacs. After having done so, she waited for Nehru to express sympathy, enquire as to what she intended doing, where would she stay, her monetary position, whether she wanted anything, and what he could do for her. But, Nehru showed no interest and said nothing. After some time, she left disappointed.

She returned to Ahmedabad to stay with a cousin. Neither Nehru, nor the Congress Party bothered about her well-being. Such was the fate of the lady who gave her all to the nation and of the daughter of a person who made India what it is today! Contrast this with the Nehru Dynasty, who enjoyed all the fruits, while others had made all the sacrifices.

ILL-TREATMENT OF DR AMBEDKAR

Among the leaders of pre-independence times, none could come near Dr BR Ambedkar in academics, and in the quality and wisdom of his writings. If he was at number one, the rest started from number eleven. Ambedkar was BA–Economics & Political Science from Bombay University; MA– Economics from Columbia University, USA; MSc–Economics & Finance from London School of Economics; PhD–Finance from Columbia University; DSc (Doctor of Science)–Economics from London School of Economics; and Barrister-at-Law from Gray's Inn, London. Compare that with the lower second division graduation of Nehru—Nehru's only degree.

After independence, Ambedkar was invited to serve as the first Law Minister of India. He was also appointed Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee. He had remarked with pride: "The Hindus wanted the Vedas, and they sent for Vyasa, who was not a caste Hindu. The Hindus wanted an epic, and they sent for Valmiki, who was an untouchable. The Hindus want a Constitution, and they have sent for me."{Mac/25}

The logic, wisdom and analysis in Dr Ambedkar's writings is impressive —far too superior to that of Nehru's. In all relevant fields, Ambedkar was far more competent and knowledgeable than Nehru. He was also much wiser, and experienced, having handled important portfolios before independence.

India would have immensely benefited if either Sardar Patel or Ambedkar had become India's first PM; or, Ambedkar had become Finance Minister. But, did Nehru try to make use of Ambedkar's immense talents? No. Nehru never engaged with him—Ambedkar's towering intellectual superiority perhaps gave him an inferiority complex, and he avoided him. Nehru wanted only 'chamchas' and hangers-on. Here is an extract from the resignation letter of Dr Ambedkar from the Nehru's cabinet dated 27 September 1951:{Amb5}

"As a result of my being a Member of the Viceroy's Executive Council, I knew the Law Ministry to be administratively of no importance. It gave no opportunity for shaping the policy of the Government of India. We used to call it an empty soap box only good for old lawyers to play with. When the Prime Minister [not voluntarily, but at the instance of Gandhi] made me the offer [Law Minister], I told him that besides being a lawyer by my education and experience, I was competent to run any administrative Department and that in the old Viceroy's Executive

Council, I held two administrative portfolios, that of Labour and C.P.W.D., where a great deal of planning projects were dealt with by me and would like to have some administrative portfolio… The Prime Minister agreed and said he would give me in addition to Law the Planning Department which, he said, was intending to create. Unfortunately the Planning Department came very late in the day and when it did come, I was left out. During my time, there have been many transfers of portfolios from one Minister to another. I thought I might be considered for any one of them. But I have always been left out of consideration. Many Ministers have been given two or three portfolios so that they have been overburdened. Others like me have been wanting more work…

"It is difficult to understand what is the principle underlying the distribution of Government work among Ministers which the Prime Minister follows. Is it capacity? Is it trust? Is it friendship? Is it pliability? I was not even appointed to be a member of main Committees of the Cabinet such as Foreign Affairs Committee, or the Defence Committee. When the Economics Affairs Committee was formed, I expected, in view of the fact that I was primarily a student of Economics and Finance, to be appointed to this Committee. But I was left out…"{Amb5}

Rather than having him in the parliament and in the cabinet in a post suited to his genius, Nehru campaigned against him, and exerted his level best to have him defeated in the elections.

In an article 'A Case For Bhim Rajya'{URL59} in the Outlook magazine of 20 August 2012 the author S Anand describes a shocking incident:

"Let us begin at the end, with one of the worst humiliations in Ambedkar's life, less than three months before his death. On September 14, 1956, exactly a month before he embraced Buddhism with half-amillion followers in Nagpur, he wrote a heart-breaking letter to prime minister Nehru from his 26, Alipore Road residence in Delhi. Enclosing two copies of the comprehensive Table of Contents of his mnemonic opus, *The Buddha and His Dhamma* , Ambedkar suppressed pride and sought Nehru's help in the publication of a book he had worked on for five years: 'The cost of printing is very heavy and will come to about Rs 20,000. This is beyond my capacity, and I am, therefore, canvassing help from all quarters. I wonder if the Government of India could purchase

500 copies for distribution among the various libraries and among the many scholars whom it is inviting during the course of this year for the celebration of Buddha's 2,500 years' anniversary.'

"Ambedkar had perhaps gotten used to exclusion by then. The greatest exponent of Buddhism after Asoka had ruthlessly been kept out of this Buddha Jayanti committee presided over by S. Radhakrishnan, then vice president... Worse, when Nehru replied to Ambedkar the next day, he said that the sum set aside for publications related to Buddha Jayanti had been exhausted, and that he should approach Radhakrishnan, chairman of the commemorative committee. Nehru also offered some business advice, gratuitously: 'I might suggest that your books might be on sale in Delhi and elsewhere at the time of Buddha Jayanti celebrations when many people may come from abroad. It might find a good sale then.' Radhakrishnan is said to have informed Ambedkar on phone about his inability to help him…

"This is the vinaya that the prime minister and vice-president of the day extended to the former law minister and chairperson of the drafting committee of the Constitution. It was suggested with impertinence that Ambedkar could set up a stall, hawk copies and recover costs..."{URL59}

Couldn't they have spared a few thousand for Ambedkar's great works when the Government could spend lacs on all kind of sundry and selected and collected works of Nehru and Gandhi that had comparatively far less value.

As long as the Nehru Dynasty was in power, the Ambedkar memorial in the capital was in bad shape. Writes Neha Bhatt in an article 'A Fall Into Sear And Yellow Leaf' in the Outlook magazine of 20 August 2012{URL59} : "The untended grounds of 26, Alipur Road, in New Delhi's upscale Civil Lines neighbourhood, give a telling foretaste of the overall neglect of the building. It's hard to believe that this is the Dr Ambedkar National Memorial, where the man spent his twilight years and breathed his last. The visitor's book here reveals more than the walls themselves—scribbled in by the few visitors it receives, some all the way from Maharashtra, Haryana, Gujarat, are urgent requests, not only for a 'better' memorial, but for basic amenities like fans, lights and some ventilation."{URL59}

#### ILL-TREATMENT OF DR SHYAMA PRASAD MUKHERJEE

Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee (1901–1953) was the son of Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee (1864–1924), renowned as 'Banglar Bagh' or the 'Tiger of Bengal'. Ashutosh Mukherjee was a great educationist who had helped found many educational institutions like the Bengal Technical Institute, College of Science, University College of Law, and the Calcutta Mathematical Society, and had served as the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta during 1906–1914.

Following in his father's illustrious footsteps, Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee became the youngest Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta at the age of 33 in 1934, and remained in that post till 1938. He was an eloquent speaker.

He was elected to the Bengal Legislative Council in 1929, and again in 1937. Disenchanted with the Congress, he joined the Hindu Mahasabha in 1939, along with NC Chatterjee. He was sworn in as Finance Minister of Bengal in 1941. He was elected as the first Indian President of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1943. He was the Minister for Industry and Supply in Nehru's cabinet after independence, and joined the Congress. His performance was outstanding: Chittaranjan Locomotive Factory, Hindustan Aircraft Factory, and Sindri Fertilizer Works started under his leadership.

But for his joint efforts, there would have been no Bengal in India—the whole of it would have gone to Pakistan: he ensured the partition of Bengal in 1947.

He deplored Nehru's handling of the East Bengal refugee problem and the Kashmir issue, and had serious differences with him. He opposed the Nehru-Liaquat Pact of 1950 (Blunder#48), and in protest resigned from the cabinet, and left the Congress. He co-founded the Bhartiya Jan Sangh on 21 October 1951, and became its first President.

On Kashmir, Dr Mukherjee wrote forthrightly to Nehru on various occasion in 1953:

"One common feature of your speeches has been and is the abundance of abuses and vituperation which you have poured forth on those who differ from you. You have ascribed us all sorts of base motives and have even dubbed us as betrayers of the country's interests. I have no desire to

emulate you in this respect… [On communalism] This is most unfair charge and unconsciously you have been recently indulging in such attacks only to hide the weakness of your case. Our approach to the [Kashmir] problem is actuated by highest national and patriotic considerations... You will forgive me if I fail to appreciate your repeated reference to possible international complications as a result of Jammu movement. No one today will claim that your handling of the Kashmir problem has enhanced our international prestige or has won us wide international support or sympathy. On the other hand, your policy in this behalf has added to complications both at home and abroad…"{Mak/429}

He opposed Article 370 related to J&K (Dr Ambedkar, Sardar Patel and others too had expressed their disapproval of it), and opposed the decision to grant Kashmir a special status with its own flag and Prime Minister, and according to which, no one, including the President of India, could enter into Kashmir without the permission of Kashmir's Prime Minister! He coined a slogan: "Ek desh mein do Vidhan, do Pradhan aur do Nishan nahi challenge" (A single country can't have two constitutions, two prime ministers, and two national emblems).

Wrote historian Makkhan Lal: "Strange as it may sound, the peoples' demand for complete integration of Jammu and Kashmir with Indian Union and for one Constitution, one Flag and one Prime Minister should have been judged as 'treason to the country'. Those who violated each and every agreement, who behaved treacherously and who made a mockery of Indian Constitution should have been called a 'nationalist'! Only Jawaharlal Nehru could have done it."{Mak/430-31}

In protest, Dr Mukherjee tried to enter Kashmir on 11 May 1953, but was arrested at the border, and was lodged in a run-down, dilapidated structure by the then PM(!!) of J&K Sheikh Abdullah! Reportedly, all this was in the knowledge of Nehru.

Atal Behari Vajpayee, ex-PM, had accompanied (as a journalist) Dr Mukherjee up to the point he was arrested. He alleged in 2004: "When Mukherjee decided to violate the permit rule by entering J&K without a permit, we thought the Punjab government would arrest him and prevent him from proceeding further. However, that did not happen… Later, we came to know that the J&K government and Nehru government had entered

into a conspiracy, as per which it was decided that Mukherjee would be allowed to enter J&K but not be allowed to leave…"{URL68}

Vajpayee alleged the then Nehru government feared that if Mukherjee was not allowed to enter J&K, questions would be raised on integration of the state with the country, which had several drawbacks, and therefore "the J&K government was told that he should not be allowed to come back".

Even the British had not treated the Congress freedom fighters, especially the Gandhian leadership, in such an abject manner (Blunder#13) as the Free-India treated Dr Mukherjee. Dr Mukherjee was held in detention for 42 days without bringing any charges or holding a trial. During that period dignitaries like Dr Radhakrishnan, Maulana Azad and Nehru visited Srinagar, but none bothered to meet Dr Mukherjee. Maulana Azad and Nehru were in Srinagar during 16-21 May 1953. So much for Nehru being considerate, cultured and humane!

Dr Mukherjee was already not in good health, and such deliberately inhuman treatment exacerbated his dry pleurisy and coronary (heart) troubles. So callous and cruel was the attitude of the J&K government and Sheikh Abdullah (and Nehru must have been fully aware of the goings on) that Dr Mukherjee was taken to a hospital full month and a half after his arrest! And, so careless and improper was the treatment that he was administered penicillin, even though he had informed the doctor-in-charge of his allergy to penicillin. Couldn't Nehru have flown-in heart-specialists, or shifted him to New Delhi! Poor Dr Mukherjee, he succumbed to the illtreatment on 23 June 1953.

Such a major death, and that too in government custody, and yet no Enquiry Commission was set up, despite demands. Nehru stated dismissively that he had made enquiries, and was satisfied there was no wrong-doing. Was he a detective? Such an immature comment from a PM! And, if there was no wrong-doing, he could have let an Enquiry Commission establish it. An enquiry into Dr Mukherjee's death was demanded by stalwarts like Bengal CM BC Roy, MR Jayakar, PD Tandon, MV Kamath, H Kunjru, Sucheta Kripalani, NC Chatterjee, and Atulya Ghosh; and also by Ms Jogmaya Devi, mother of Dr Mookerjee, but Nehru obstinately turned a deaf ear. Several prominent personalities protested Nehru not conducting an enquiry, but Nehru was unmoved.

Disgusted, Ms Jogmaya Devi, mother of Dr Mookerjee, finally wrote to Nehru:

"It is futile to address to you further. You are afraid to face facts. I hold the Kashmir government responsible for the death of my son. I accuse your government of complicity in the matter. You may let loose your mighty resources to carry on a desperate propaganda, but truth is sure to find its way out and one day you will have to answer this to the people of India and to God in Heaven."{Mak/439}

It was not democracy, it was an autocracy under Nehru. There have been numerous major instances during the Nehruvian era where cases that could adversely affect Nehru's image or that of his government were either not taken cognizance of, or not booked, or enquiries were not conducted. And, if so done under public pressure, the same were subsequently scuttled. And, where they could not be scuttled, their reports were suppressed, or kept classified, like the Henderson-Brooks/Bhagat Report on the 1962 India-China War debacle. Such things are impossible in the current media age. Had even 5% of the current media existed then, Nehru would have stood exposed much earlier in his term.

Significantly, within three months of Dr Mukherjee's martyrdom, Nehru had eggs all over his face: Sheikh Abdullah had to be unseated and locked in jail!

#### ILL-TREATMENT OF DR RAJENDRA PRASAD

Among the freedom fighters, Dr Rajendra Prasad had about the best academic record (barring Dr Ambedkar). He did his MA in Economics from the University of Calcutta. Impressed by his answers, an examiner had once commented on his answer sheet "examinee is better than examiner". {Aru/159} He served as a professor in English, and as principal of a college. Later, while pursuing his law studies in Kolkata he also worked as Professor of Economics at Calcutta City College. He won gold medal in the examination of Masters of Law. He did his Doctorate in Law.

He had a roaring law practice which he gave up at the peak of his career in the cause of freedom. Keeping his legal competence and suitability in mind, he was unanimously elected as the president of the Constituent

Assembly. But, he was not a Nehru-camp follower. Nehru therefore tried his level best to sideline him. To scuttle Dr Rajendra Prasad's chance to become the first president of India, Nehru had even bluffed! As per the book "Nehru: A Troubled Legacy" by a former intelligence officer RNP Singh, Nehru wrote to Rajendra Prasad on 10 September 1949 that he (Nehru) and Sardar Patel had decided that "the safest and best course" would be to have C Rajagopalachari as the first president of India, even though Nehru had never discussed the matter with Sardar Patel or obtained his concurrence. The bluff was exposed when Rajendra Prasad referred the issue to Patel. RNP Singh says: "Nehru had resorted to desperate measures to prevent Prasad from occupying the position of president and these measures included blatant lying."{RNPS/46}

Nehru didn't want Dr Rajendra Prasad to get elected for the second term as the President of India in 1957. Towards that end he carried out a campaign, even alleging in his speeches that people in high positions have a tendency to cling to their posts—not realising the irony of that comment on himself! However, despite Nehru's manoeuvrings, Dr Rajendra Prasad got re-elected.

As per Durga Das, when Dr Rajendra Prasad was ill and it was suspected that he might not survive, Nehru was reported to have deputed Lal Bahadur Shastri, his trusted lieutenant, to search a place of funeral as far away as possible from that of Gandhi! Nehru didn't want Dr Rajendra Prasad to get any prominence.{DD} However, Rajendra Prasad survived. When Dr Rajendra Prasad died in Bihar, and his funeral was held in Patna, Nehru did not attend, saying that he was busy with election campaign fund collection in Gujarat! That time Nehru had advised the then President Dr Radhakrishnan, "I do not see any reason for you to go." Dr Radhakrishnan had replied: "No, I think I must go and attend the funeral. That respect is due to him and must be paid. I think you should give up your tour and come with me." But, Nehru stuck to his programme.{DD/339}

Nehru was so conceited he wouldn't allow President Dr Rajendra Prasad to visit foreign nations on the plea that he didn't project a secular enough image abroad! In his first term, the President visited only Nepal. It was only in the second term that he visited some other Asian nations including Japan, and made an excellent impression on host nations. The US President Eisenhower invited him to the US, but Nehru scuttled the proposal. Please

### ILL-TREATMENT OF PD TANDON

The "great democrat" Nehru, who had most undemocratically become the first PM (Blunder#6), manoeuvred for a complete domination over the party in 1950, just before Patel's demise, by having a Congress President of his choice elected. Nehru unilaterally declared the socialist JB Kripalani as the presidential candidate, even though he and Patel had earlier agreed not to support Kripalani. Patel was hurt and said: "I have been shaken to bones. How low he [Nehru] has stooped."{Mak/297}

Patel gave full support to Purshottamdas Tandon for the presidentship. Tandon, a respected leader, was well-known for his simplicity, uprightness and fearlessness, and as someone who could not be pushed around—a trait that perhaps rankled with Nehru. However, to undermine his candidature, the pseudo-secular Nehru tried to project Tandon as communal, and as a revivalist—the old Marxist-Communist-Nehruvian-Socialist trick. This branding business started with Nehru. You brand and defame a person as fascist, communal, conservative, non-modern, revivalist, and so on, and get rid of him. As per Nehru's definition, the conceited crypto-communists like Krishna Menon and KM Panikkar who caused indescribable harm to India were good and deserving of high public positions, but not people like Tandon.

In this context it is worth noting that Tandon was among the topmost freedom fighters who had made tremendous sacrifice for the nation. He had also vociferously opposed partition. He had opposed t he AICC Resolution of 14 June 1947 moved by GB Pant on partition, and had voted against it. He had stated he was prepared to suffer the British rule a little longer than pay the heavy price of partition. He claimed the Nehru government had been intimidated by the Muslim League. He got a huge applause when at the end of his speech he said: "Let us fight both the British and the [Muslim] League."{DD/248}

Nehru's objections included Tandon attending a Refugees' Conference, and so on—that didn't make sense. The arrogant Nehru even wrote these

intemperate, holier-than-thou words to patriotic Tandon: "Your election would mean great encouragement to certain forces in India which I consider harmful."{Mak/251} Wrote Brig. BN Sharma: "Nehru had a known dislike for anyone who stood staunchly for his Indian identity or philosophy, based on our rich cultural heritage, preservation of Hindi language and best of our old traditions…" {BNS/281}

In sharp contrast to Nehru's crude and accusive remarks, Tandon, in his elegant letter to Nehru of 12 August 1950, wrote:

"…You seem to connect me with narrow communalism and what you call revivalism. …there have been some matters on which you and I have not seen eye to eye—the adoption of Hindi as national language and the partition [Tandon had opposed it] of the country with its consequential issues being the chief among them. It is a failing even with great persons to take their own geese for swans, their own aptitudes for fundamental principles. But I ask you to look at the matter with some detachment. In any case why should it be necessary to attribute narrowness to others who differ from you?... Revivalism is a confusing expression. It may mean renaissance and it may mean reactionarism. I would revive today some of the great spiritual standards that our country stood for in the past. I regard them as precious legacies. At the same time I reject strongly the irrational dogmas that surround both Hinduism and Islam in action… I hold that all religious precepts have to be weighed by the intellect and not one of them can be accepted merely by the authority of a book…"{Mak/282}

Nehru threatened to resign if Tandon was elected President. Nehru wrote to Patel on 25 August 1950:

"I am absolutely clear in my mind that, in the event of Tandon's election, I should treat this as a vote of no-confidence in me by Congressmen or at any rate by those who vote in the presidential election. As a result of this, I cannot function in the Congress Working Committee or other executives. As a further consequence, I cannot continue as Prime Minister."{Mak/294}

Despite the threat and manoeuvres of Nehru, Tandon won with 1306 votes against Kriplani's 1092. Nehru, the power-hungry person, of course, didn't resign. On the next day of the election results, when Rajaji came to meet Patel, Patel asked him jocularly: "Have you brought Jawaharlal's resignation?"{Mak/300} Incidentally, just a day before the elections, Rafi

Ahmad Kidwai [Nehru's confidante) had told Rajaji: "If Tandon succeeds and he [Nehru] does not resign, I will say publicly that he is an opportunist."{Mak/300}

However, soon after Patel's death on 15 December 1950 Nehru began his manoeuvrings to get Tandon out. Nehru threatened to withdraw from the CWC unless it was reconstituted as per his wishes—an improper demand considering it was the Congress President's prerogative.

After Patel's death, it was not difficult for Nehru to exert pressure given that he was the PM, who was in a position to distribute largesse and throw crumbs; and would be the key-person in the distribution of tickets for the forthcoming 1952 elections. Tandon tried to resist Nehru's moves, but given the immense pressure brought upon him by various quarters at the instance of Nehru, he finally succumbed, and resigned on 9 September 1951. Nehru promptly took over as the President of the Congress, in addition to being the PM, disregarding the Congress principle of one-person-one-post. In sharp contrast, during Gandhi's time, when Nehru as President of the Congress became the PM of the Interim Government in 1946, he had to vacate the post of Party President. Further, rather than being the President for one year as was the norm, he continued as the Party President for three years from 1951 to 1954, and left it only after he could install the obedient and loyal UN Dhebar as President, and keep him in that position from 1954 to 1958, to be followed by Indira Gandhi as the President. Indira was followed by another Nehru loyalist Sanjiva Reddy who remained the Congress President during 1960–63. Of course, Reddy later complained that he was treated "as Mrs Gandhi's chaprasi [peon]"{RNPS/24} . Nehru sought not only his own dominance, but also his dynasty's dominance! The Congress veteran DP Mishra resigned in protest observing: "The last straw has been our Prime Minister becoming a full-fledged dictator by contriving the ejection of Mr. P.D. Tandon from the Presidentship of the Congress and himself taking his place. I regard it as treachery to the nation to continue in the Congress in the face of this last development… A political murder committed yesterday is a murder of democracy in the Congress. This is merely the beginning of the slaughter of democracy in India."{Mak/308}

After the above unfortunate event of usurping the Congress Presidentship from Tandon, Nehru became the uncrowned king, for he headed both the government (as PM) and the party (as President), and could play the political game as he chose. No body dared to oppose Nehru thereafter.

## ILL-TREATMENT OF BORDOLOI

Please check Blunder#5, Blunder#59, and Blunder#111 above to know more about Gopinath Bordoloi, and Bordoloi-Nehru tiff.

People often do not appreciate that one of the reasons that a state like Assam is in India today is due to the courageous stand of Gopinath Bordoloi, the first Chief Minister of Assam, who fought the Muslim League's effort to include Assam and other parts of the North-East Region (NER) in East Pakistan. The Congress Party at the national level, led by Nehru, would have acquiesced to the Muslim League had it not been for a revolt by Bordoloi, backed by the Assam unit of the Congress Party and supported by Mahatma Gandhi and the Assamese public.

—*Sanjoy Hazarika in his book "Writing on the wall" {* SH/11}

That great man from Assam, Gopinath Bordoloi, despite his achievements—far more than most of the Indian leaders, with the added uniqueness that like Sardar Patel, who was instrumental in expanding the Indian territory by about 40% by accession of the Indian Princely States, Bordoloi helped expand India's geographical boundary to Assam and the Northeast—was not awarded Bharat Ratna by Nehru&Dynasty, while many, not as deserving, got that award. Why? He had opposed Nehru before independence, and for good reason—to include Assam in India—and that was the reason Nehru and his dynasty deprived him of well-deserved Bharat Ratna. It was only when a non-Congress (Vajpayee) government came to power that Bordoloi, a veteran Congressman, was awarded the Bharat Ratna posthumously in 1999.

## ILL-TREATMENT OF GENERAL THIMAYYA

General Thimayya was a highly accomplished army-man. Here is one of his many accomplishments: As a Major-General in the J&K war of the late 1940s, Thimayya had taken his tanks to a height of about 12000 feet on the snow-capped Zojila Pass—something unique in history, as nobody had

taken tanks to such heights and in such hazardous conditions before—and routed the enemy, destroying all their bunkers. (Pl. also check Blunder#23.)

In the Nehru-Raj it didn't pay to raise professional objections to the civilian handling of military matters! No self-respecting senior army-officer would have attempted to caution Nehru or Menon on matters relating to the Indian army—it didn't pay to be professional, frank and honest. You couldn't tell the truth without the fear of tongue-lashing and victimisation. General Thimayya, the Chief of Army Staff, made that mistake. And, suffered. He resigned on 1 September 1959, miffed by Nehru's Defence Minister Krishna Menon's discourteous behaviour, and his refusal to heed Thimayya's advice for better army preparation. Nehru had, however, managed to persuade Thimayya to withdraw his resignation on the promise that he would suitably look into his grievances. But, after Thimayya had withdrawn his resignation, rather than reprimanding Menon, and looking into the issues raised by Thimayya, Nehru went dismissive telling the Parliament that Thimayya had resigned on 'issues trivial and of no consequence, which had arisen from temperamental conflict'. That could not have been the reason, as Thimayya was a thorough, seasoned professional, a disciplined soldier, and a great patriot—no wonder, even today, the contents of Thimayya's resignation letter remain a highly guarded secret{SKV/L-707} . At that insult and double humiliation, Thimayya should have re-submitted his resignation to teach Nehru and Menon a lesson.

Wrote RNP Singh in 'Nehru: a Troubled Legacy': "The way Nehru handled the resignation of General Thimayya dealt a bad blow to the discipline of the Armed Forces and their self-confidence."{RNPS}

Wrote Durga Das: "If the prime minister was letting down and humiliating the chief of army staff, he was also ignoring the fact that the general's resignation had sprung from valid grounds which were relevant to the discipline and efficiency of the armed forces at a time when the country's frontiers were being threatened."{DD},{URL69}

"Publicly Nehru was seen to be fond of Timmy; however, behind his back, the prime minister adopted tactics that clearly indicated that he viewed Thimayya as a rival who could challenge his position as the undisputed head of the Indian Union. Given the general's track record in World War II—Thimayya had been the first and only Indian officer to command a fighting brigade in the Arakan where he had been awarded the

Distinguished Service Order (DSO)—and the role played by him in the Jammu and Kashmir Operations, Nehru knew he could not browbeat him..."{SKV/L-670} "The prime minister's attitude towards Thimayya was damaging to the chief as well as the army."{SKV/L-712}

Wrote MKK Nair:

"Krishna Menon did not respect military traditions. The Army Chief General Thimayya was an able and multifaceted person. He had become the general after meritorious service in Kashmir and South Korea. The close bonding in Army is achieved by strict enforcement of discipline. Orders flow from the General and are carried out by hierarchical tiers. No one broke rank improperly. Thimayya's dignified nature brought him into conflict with the dictatorial Krishna Menon. Differences between them worsened when Krishna Menon, disregarding military discipline, began to deal directly with his favoured officers. Finally Thimayya went off to Europe to head the United Nation's Peacekeeping Force and General Thapar, who Krishna Menon believed would always be obedient to him, was made the General. To do this, Menon ignored the seniority of the brilliant General Thorat, who resigned in protest."{MKN}

After the retirement of Thimayya, Thapar was made the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) at the instance of Menon and BM Kaul—junior, but whom Nehru and Menon listened to—rather than Thorat, whom Thimayya had recommended, and who had a relatively much more distinguished career. Later, Thapar returned BM Kaul's favour by making him CGS—Chief of General Staff—ignoring the much more capable officers. In the army hierarchy, CGS was considered next to COAS. India was let down in the 1962 India-China war by, among others, Thapar and BM Kaul.

#### ILL-TREATMENT OF PUBLIC

Brigadier (Retd.) BN Sharma narrates an episode in his book 'India Betrayed' which is upsetting{BNS/2-4} : The author, then a young boy, lived in Shri Gandhi Ashram, Meerut, where his uncle was General Secretary. Nehru was to come to Meerut to deliver an election speech for Provincial Assembly Elections of 1937 at the Town Hall. Upon arrival he was angry at the arrangements. A man responsible for the arrangements bowed before

Nehru with folded hands requesting him not to leave. However, in full public view of thousands crowding the place, Nehru kicked the man, already prostrate at his feet, and kept doing so. Everyone was shocked and dismayed. Kriplani then physically pulled Nehru away. To the young mind of the author, this left a deep mark. The author writes that Nehru was arrogant, and that he exulted in public display of anger. Nehru perhaps considered it a sign of royalty to be short-tempered and to show one's temper, and anger and impatience publicly.

Sita Ram Goel{SRG} described an episode when Nehru came to address a public meeting in the Gandhi Grounds adjacent to the Chandni Chowk in Delhi in 1935 (Goel was then a student of the seventh standard):

"There was a thunderous applause as Pandit Nehru came up on the rostrum, greeted the people with folded hands, and was formally introduced by a local Congress leader. But the next thing I saw made me rub my eyes. The great man had become red in the face, turned to his left, and planted a slap smack on the face of the same leader who was standing near the mike. The mike had failed. Pandit Nehru was gesticulating and shouting at the top of his voice as if something terrible had happened.

"Meanwhile the mike started functioning again so that he could be heard all over the place. He [Nehru] was saying: 'Dilli ki Congress ke karykarta kamine hain, razil hain, namaqul hain. Maine kitni bar inse kaha hai ke intizam nahin kar sakte to mujhe mat bulaya karo, par ye sunte hi nahin (the leaders of the Congress in Delhi are lowbred, mean, and mindless people. I have told them time and again not to invite me if they cannot make proper arrangements. But they pay no heed).'...

"This was a new experience for me… I had never witnessed such wild behaviour on a public platform. Of course, those other speakers were not so big as this one. Was it the way the big ones behaved? I wondered. I found it difficult to admire a man who had not only shouted at but also slapped someone who was placed lower than him in life, and who was in no position to hit back. And that too for no fault of the victim. Even as a young boy, I had nothing but contempt for bullies."{SRG/62-63}

In a public meeting in 1942 after the failure of the Cripps Mission, in response to a commotion in the audience, Nehru shouted what could be heard over the mike, as described by Sitaram Goel, who had attended the meeting: "Dekhna chahta hun in kaminon ko main. Bata dena chahta hun

inko ki main kown hun. Inki ye gandi harkaten main qatai bardasht nahin kar sakta (I want to have a look at these lowbred people. I want to tell them who I am. I cannot tolerate this dirty behaviour on their part)… Main ek shandar admi hun (I am a man of some stature)... Much worse came after the meeting dispersed. He descended from the rostrum and started moving towards the gate where I was standing. Congress volunteers had formed a cordon round him. But as the people rushed forward and tried to touch his feet, he pushed away the volunteers and started looking after himself. He was slapping with both his hands and kicking with both his feet the people who came near him. He was wearing full boots. Some of his fans must have been badly hurt. I thought he had no business to treat his people in this cruel manner. After all, they were only trying to show their devotion to him in the only way they had learnt from their tradition."{SRG/64}

Sitaram Goel described another shocking episode:

"I happened to be in Delhi towards the end of 1947 or in early 1948, and went to see my journalist friend from America. As I have mentioned, he had left Calcutta for Delhi soon after India became free. As I sat down with him in the Coffee House, he said, '*Sita, who does this man [Nehru] think he is? Almighty God?* ' I asked him, 'Who? What has happened?' He told me the story of some Sadhus who had sat down on an indefinite fast near Pandit Nehru's residence in New Delhi, and were seeking an assurance from him that cow slaughter would be stopped now that the beef eating British had departed. My friend said, 'I had gone there to take some pictures, and gather a report. American readers love such stories from India. But what I saw was a horror for me. As I was talking to one of the Sadhus who knew some English, this man [Nehru] rushed out of his house accompanied by his sister, Mrs. Pandit. Both of them were shouting something in Hindi. The poor Sadhus were taken by surprise, and stood up. This man slapped the Sadhu who had moved forward with folded hands. His sister [Vijayalaxmi Pandit] did the same. They were saying something which sounded pretty harsh. Then both of them turned back, and disappeared as fast as they had come. The Sadhus did not utter so much as a word in protest, not even after the duo had left. They had taken it all as if it was the normal thing.' I observed, 'But in the case of Pandit Nehru, it is the normal thing. He has been slapping and kicking people all his life.' He [the American journalist] concluded, '*I do not know the norm in your country. In my country, if the President so much*

*as shouts on a citizen, he will have to go. We take it from no bastard, no matter how big he happens to be* .'"{SRG/65}

### SPECIAL TREATMENT FOR EDWINA MOUNTBATTEN

Edwina was buried at sea in 1960, as per her will—a tribute to Mountbatten's naval career. British frigate Wakeful which carried her body to the sea off Spithead, a channel off southern England, was escorted by an Indian frigate Trishul—such importance India under Nehru gave her. Contrast this with the treatment meted out by Nehru to Sardar Patel, Netaji Subhas, Dr Ambedkar and Dr Rajendra Prasad after their death—that we covered above!

Going by several books and material on the web, including Alex Von Tunzelmann's 'Indian Summer: The Secret History of the End of an Empire', while Mountbatten had several affairs, Edwina was from a rich family, indulged herself, and had many lovers—Nehru was one in that series. But, was Edwina very good looking? Hardly, though she was whiteskinned—something brown sahibs bent down to. Tunzelmann writes:

"…'Please keep this to yourselves but she [Edwina] and Jawaharlal are so sweet together,' he [Mountbatten] wrote to his elder daughter, Patricia. 'They really dote on each other in the nicest way and Pammy and I are doing everything we can to be tactful and help… And so Edwina and Jawahar walked together among the wild strawberry bushes during the days and drove with Pamela along winding roads to the brightly lit town of Shimla in the evenings..."{Tunz/323}

"…'Nehru in those days was having a roaring love affair with Lady Mountbatten,' added Bakhtiar, 'said to be with the tacit approval of Mountbatten.'" Further, "Jinnah had been handed a small collection of letters that had been written by Edwina and Jawahar. 'Dickie [Mountbatten] will be out tonight—come after 10.00 o'clock,' said one of Edwina's. Another revealed that 'You forgot your handkerchief and before Dickie could spot it I covered it up.' A third said 'I have fond memories of Simla—riding and your touch.'"{Tunz/208-9} (Incidentally, Jinnah did not use the letters.)

[In 1948] "…Nehru was officially received at Heathrow, but his first action after that was to go to the Mountbattens' small flat… For Edwina, his midnight visit was 'too lovely'. The very next day, she drove him to Broadlands [Edwina's secluded country house]. Dickie tactfully ensured that he would be absent for much of the time at Dartmouth… 'Edwina will be awaiting you,' he wrote to Jawahar. The two of them [Nehru-Edwina], alone at last in the privacy of her estate, were able to talk, laugh and cry together, to embrace and to press each other's hands on walks by the river. Even after Dickie turned up, the weekend was a great success, so much so that Jawahar changed his plans so that he might return the following weekend as well…"{Tunz/337}

"…Whenever he [Nehru] was in Britain for a conference or diplomatic visit, he would stay with Edwina at Broadlands. During these sojourns, Dickie [Mountbatten] would remove himself to their London address…"{Tunz/340}

When Edwina died in an Indonesian Hotel in Borneo on 21 February 1960, a number of letters were found strewn around her—said to be the love letters of Nehru!{Wolp2/474}

Wrote Nehru's secretary M.O. 'Mac' Mathai: "One thing that I could not fail to notice was that whenever Nehru stood by the side of Lady Mountbatten, he had a sense of triumph."{Mac/209}

MO Mathai also wrote: "Once, at a reception at the India House in London, to which Attlee and several other dignitaries came, Nehru stood in a corner chatting with Lady Mountbatten all the while. Krishna Menon turned to me and said that people were commenting on it and requested me to break in so that Nehru could move about."{Mac/14}

Wrote Rustamji:

"JN [Jawaharlal Nehru] had the typical Indian weakness of being impressed by foreign women—white women—they were his favourite."{Rust/64}

"On a visit to Assam, he [Nehru] asked me to ensure that the orchids he ordered in Shillong reached Lady Mountbatten in London safely."{Rust/39}

Stanley Wolpert personally watched Edwina and Nehru together at a function in New Delhi, and wrote:

"I was surprised at how cheerful Nehru appeared that evening and how like adolescent lovers he [Nehru] and Edwina behaved, touching,

whispering into each other's ears, laughing, holding hands. …Lord Mountbatten himself often referred to Nehru's correspondence with his wife as love letters, knowing better than anyone but Nehru how much Edwina adored her handsome 'Jawaha', as she lovingly called him. This was why Nehru's daughter Indira hated her…"{Wolp2/viii}

Reportedly, Nehru used to go to London to be with Edwina almost every year, or she used to come to India, and stay with him—after independence. Also, reportedly, one of the jobs of Krishna Menon as High Commissioner in London, for which he used to gladly volunteer, was to receive Nehru at the airport at any hour and drive him down to Edwina's secluded country house—Broadlands—where Nehru and Edwina could enjoy complete privacy. {Wolp2/10}

Wrote Stanley Wolpert:

"Nehru flew off again to London... Krishna Menon was waiting with the Rolls, as usual, at London's airport and drove him back to Edwina shortly before midnight... Indira was upset by her father's unrelenting obsession with 'that Mountbatten lady'!"{Wolp2/443}

"Jawahar tried to talk Edwina into staying on with him after Dickie [Mountbatten] flew home [in June 1948], for he knew by now that her heart belonged to him alone. Mountbatten, of course, also 'knew that they were lovers', as did all of their close friends. Edwina's sister Mary hated Nehru for it... Still he wanted her, needed her, pleaded with her..."{Wolp2/435}

MJ Akbar writes about the encounter of Russi Mody, once the Chief Executive of Tata Steel, with Nehru at Nainital where Nehru was staying with his father and UP Governor, Sir Homi Mody.

"Sir Homi was very pukka, and when the gong sounded at eight he instructed his son to go to the Prime Minister's bedroom and tell him dinner was ready. Russi Mody marched up, opened the door and saw Jawaharlal and Edwina in a clinch. Jawaharlal looked at Russi Mody and grimaced. Russi quickly shut the door and walked out."{Akb/391}

Wrote K Natwar Singh: "I once asked Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, Nehru's sister, if the rumours about her brother having an affair with Edwina Mountbatten were true. She was herself a diva and uninhibited in her conversation. She said to me: 'Of course he did. And good for him.'"{Nat1}

Nehru's correspondence with Edwina contained matters of national importance, for he used to share his thinking with her. Hence, they are of vital historical importance, and not just something that are merely personal —of no consequence. Yet they are being treated as if they are the personal property of the Dynasty, and are being kept a closely guarded secret. Wolpert mentions in the preface to his book 'Nehru: A Tryst with Destiny' he tried to access the letters, but failed.{Wolp2/viii}

While one doesn't really care for the personal side of it—considering they were two consenting adults—could such relationship have compromised Nehru or India's political cause in any way? Edwina Mountbatten, about whose relationship with Nehru a lot has been written, would have most likely persuaded Nehru to go by the counsel of Mountbatten and take the Kashmir matter to the UN, but one can't be sure. Maulana Azad, a pro-Nehru person, expressed bewilderment in his autobiography as to how a person like Jawaharlal was won over by Lord Mountbatten; mentions Nehru's weakness of being impulsive and amenable to personal influences, and wonders if Lady Mountbatten factor was responsible.{Azad/198}

Reportedly, Mountbatten himself admitted that he used his wife to get an insight into Nehru's mind and, where needed, influence Nehru when he failed to bring him round to his view. Philip Zeigler, Mountbatten's biographer, stated that Mountbatten encouraged loving relationship between his wife and Nehru—to this end.
