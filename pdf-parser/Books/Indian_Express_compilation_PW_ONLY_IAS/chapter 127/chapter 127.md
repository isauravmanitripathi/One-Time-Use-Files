# As RBI surprises on govt paper sales, bond yields spike over liquidity fears

#### GEORGE MATHEW MUMBAI, OCTOBER 6

RESERVE BANK of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das Friday said the central bank may conduct open market sales of government papers to manage liquidity in the system, triggering a spike in bond yields to their highest level in financial year 2023-24(FY24)

The RBI signal on open market operations (OMOs) to rein in inflation took bond market participants by sumrise, particularly those who had anticipated an influx of foreign funds following India's inclusion in JP Morgan's bond indices

The yield on benchmark 10year government bonds shot up by 12 basis points to 7.34 per cent, the highest level since March 23. The benchmark Sensex rose by 0.55 per cent. or 364 points, to 65,995.63.

According to SBI Capital Markets, the move showed RBI's commitment to assertive control over liquidity dynamics and its vigilant approach to addressing inflation. In pursuit of these objectives, the RBI has signalled it

may employ unconventional measures like OMO bond sales through the auction route, when deemed necessary.

ICRA Analytics foresees the 10-year benchmark yield to trade between 7.25-7.40 per cent in the near term. While a tight liquidity position will help bring down inflation, it puts upward pressure on interest rates.

The decidedly hawkish market response came despite the absence of major revisions to economic projections and the decision to maintain existing interest rate

Now, the RBI emerges as a new supplier of government bonds. While there is no explicit timeline for this, an apprehension remains that such OMOs can be

announced any day. "This is especially so since the market understands that the best of liquidity is likely over October-December quarter. Core liquidity may shrink enough by then for the RBI to not want to persist with OMOs from the next quarter. Thus, the risk of this additional supply is more near term, and this may weigh more on the minds of market participants,' said Suyash Choudhary, Head, Fixed Income, Bandhan AMC.

In Mumbai, Das said: "Festival time increase in currency demand may, of course. act as a counter balancing factor. It is a turning pitch and we will play our shots carefully. Going forward, while remaining nimble, we may have to consider OMO sales to manage liquidity. consistent with the stance of monetary policy." The timing and quantum of such operations will depend on the evolving liquidity conditions, he added.

The market was not expecting this measure from the RBI to suck out excess liquidity. Due to the forthcoming festival season, liquidity is expected to tighten due to cash withdrawal from the banking system, said Murthy

Nagarajan, Head, Fixed income, Tata Asset Management.

The RBI's retail inflation forecast for at 5.2 per cent for the first quarter of FY25, coupled with the governor's emphasis on the target level of 4 per cent rather than the 6 per cent band, is seen as a hawkish message, aligning with the stance of "higher for longer".

As per market estimates, core system liquidity is of the order of Rs 325,000 crore after the I-CRR (incremental cash reserve ratio) unwind. However, currency in circulation is expected to rise by Rs 225,000- 250,000 crore by the end of March 2024, as per normal seasonal trends. Further, the balance of payment has been quite healthy over the first half of the year and is unlikely to be the same over the rest of the year. "While this is speculative and difficult to model, but already RBI's dollar sales have picked up. The point we are making is that, in all likelihood there is no reason at all to take permanent measures on liquidity mop up given that most of the core liquidity surplus is already poised to vanish by the financial year end," Choudhary said.

## Status quo on key rate: What happens now?

GEORGE MATHEW & HITESH VYAS MUMBAI, OCTOBER 6

WITH RETAIL inflation remaining a "major risk to macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth". the six-member Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India kept key interest rates unchanged. So, banks will not raise lending rates which, in turn, means that equated monthly instalments will remain steady. While MPC led by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has retained the policy stance as 'withdrawal of accommodation', it has also retained the inflation projection at 5.4 per cent for FY2024 in the wake of high food inflation, signalling that a rate cut is unlikely in the near future. The MPC also retained GDP growth at 6.50 per cent for FY24

the rate at which RBI lends money to banks to meet their short-term funding needs - on Friday is for the fourth time since the RBI started hiking repo rate in May 2022 to check inflation. Monetary policy transmission is still incomplete after the RBI slashed the repo rate by 250 basis points since May 2022 and headline inflation is expected to

remain above the five per cent level and even touch even 6.2 per cent in the second quarter of this year. Das said the overall inflation outlook is clouded by uncertainty by the fall in kharif sowing. lower reservoir levels, volatile global food and energy prices.

What will happen to lending, deposit rates?

**External benchmark lending** rates linked to the repo rate will not rise. This will provide relief to borrowers as their EMIs will not increase. FBLRs - 81 per cent of are linked to the benchmark repo rate - now dominate the mix of outstanding floating rate loans, with the share rising to 48.3 per cent by December 2022. whilst those based on marginal

cost of fund-based lending rate eased to 46 per cent. Banks will also not increase fixed deposit rates.

The pause, if at all it provides a breather,

should not be seen as a flattening of rate hike cycle as RBI remains focused on withdrawal of accommodation.

EXPLAINE

Existing and new home buyers should brace for continued relatively higher EMIs. But they can continue to look at options to refinance obligations and evaluate fixed rate loans if the cost benefit dynamics in the long run

turn out to be positive for them.

### Why has RBI retained its 'withdrawal' stance?

The RBI has focused on its stance of 'withdrawal of accommodation' until all risks to inflation dissipate. An accommodative stance means the central bank is prepared to expand the money supply to boost economic growth. Withdrawal of accommodation will mean re-

ducing money supply in the system which will rein in inflation further.

### What are the risks?

We have identified high inflation as a major risk to macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth," Das said. Retail inflation eased to 6.83 per cent in August from a 15-month high of 7.44 per cent in July. It continues to be above RBI's comfort zone of 2-6 per cent.
