NOTING THAT "journalism is civilisation's mirror, and investigative journalism its X-ray", the Punjab and Haryana High Court has quashed the summons and all subsequent proceedings in a defamation case registered against resident editors of The Indian Express and others.

The Bench of Justice Anoop Chitkara, in a detailed order,

noted: "Journalism is the fourth pillar of any democracy. As a journalist, the reporter's sacrosanct duty is loyalty towards the citizenry. They serve as independent monitors of power, reporting information for public good and safety, addressing any problems or lacunae in the public system for its effective functioning and immediate redressal. In the fearless pursuit of their duties to uncover the truth and report such facts to the masses through media, these brave journalists do face various hurdles.

e.g., pressures from influential parties, groups, or government agencies, etc."

"To ensure honest and correct reporting of actual events, such journalists require the protection of courts, especially constitutional courts, to enable them to publish news without fear of harmful consequences. Thus, all courts must be more vigilant and proactive while safeguarding the interests of such courageous humans," said Justice Chitkara in a detailed judgement passed on January 4. CONTINUED ON PAGE 2
