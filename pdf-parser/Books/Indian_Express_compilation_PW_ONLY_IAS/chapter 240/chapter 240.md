Since the Maldives graduated from the list of Least Developed Countries in 2011, it has sought to strengthen its partnerships in the Indian Ocean and beyond, he said. "Cooperation in the Indian Ocean must be inclusive... must include all countries in the region," he said.

"Inclusivity would alleviate factionalism and contribute to the development and cooperation of our ocean communities in this region," he said in his speech.

The speech of Latheef is viewed with interest here as he is the first high-level official of the new Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu to visit China. which gained prominence in the island nation with major investments under former President Abdulla Yameen's regime.
