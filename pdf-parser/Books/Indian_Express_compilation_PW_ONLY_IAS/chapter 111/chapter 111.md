## Storing energy in blocks: How gravity may solve green power's problem

NEW DELHI, OCTOBER 1

GRAVITY IS emerging as the best bet in solving renewable energy's biggest problem - intermittency. As countries step up renewable energy capacity addition, there is growing urgency to develop long-duration energy storage systems that could be installed alongside green power generation to balance out the variability in renewable power, given that green generation is not always in sync with the electricity demand cycle.

Energy Vault, a developer of utility-scale storage technology backed by Japan's SoftBank Group and the venture arm of Saudi Aramco, is offering a solution that promises to deploy utility-scale energy storage solutions, including proprietary gravity-based storage, to plug this gap.

Mimicking the broad attributes of pumped hydroelectric plants, which use moving water to store and discharge power, Energy Vault's proprietary 'EVx' platform utilises gravity and a mechanical elevator system to stack 35-tonne blocks made of a composite material at the top of a towering structure.

When the electricity demand is low, the elevator uses surplus electricity from the grid or electricity generated by renewable plants, to raise these blocks and line them up at the top of the structure. When electricity demand picks up, the blocks are then lowered one by one, releasing CONTINUED ON PAGE 2
