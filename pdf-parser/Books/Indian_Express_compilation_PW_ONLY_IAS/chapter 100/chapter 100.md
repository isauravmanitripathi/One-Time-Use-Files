# OSIRIS-REX

## OSIRIS-REx is the first US mission to collect an asteroid sample. This is the biggest sample brought to Earth

A NASA space capsule carrying the largest soil sample ever scooped up from the surface of an asteroid streaked through Earth's atmosphere on Sunday and parachuted into the Utah desert, delivering the celestial specimen to scientists.

The gumdrop-shaped capsule, released from the robotic spacecraft OSIRIS-REx as the mothership passed within 107.826 km of Earth hours earlier, touched down within a designated landing zone west of Salt Lake City on the US military's vast Utah Test and Training Range.

The final descent and landing capped a six-year joint mission between the US space agency and the University of Arizona. It was only the third asteroid sample, and by far the biggest, ever returned to Earth for analysis, following two similar missions by Japan's space agency ending in 2010 and 2020.

### OSIRIS-REx mission

**OSIRIS-REx launched in September** 2016 and reached Bennu, a small, carbonrich asteroid discovered in 1999, in 2018. The spacecraft spent nearly two years orbiting the asteroid before venturing close enough to snatch a sample of the loose surface material with its robotic arm on October 20, 2020. The spacecraft departed Bennu in May 2021 for a 1.9 billion km cruise back to Earth, including two orbits around the sun.

The Bennu sample has been estimated at  $250$  grams, far surpassing the 5 grams carried back from Ryugu in 2020 or the tiny specimen delivered from asteroid Itokawa in 2010.

A recovery team of scientists and technicians stood by to retrieve the capsule and attempt to keep the sample free of any terrestrial contamination.

### Bennu asteroid

OSIRIS-REx collected its specimen from Bennu. The space rock is classified as a "near-Earth object" because it passes relatively close to our planet every six years, though the odds of an impact are considered remote.

Apparently made up of a loose collection of rocks, like a rubble pile, Bennu measures just 500 meters across, making it tiny compared with the Chicxulub asteroid that struck Earth some 66 million years ago, wiping out the dinosaurs.

Like other asteroids. Bennu is a relic of the early solar system. Because its present-day chemistry and mineralogy are virtually unchanged since formation some 4.5 billion years ago, it holds valuable clues about the origins and development of rocky planets such as Earth. It may even contain organic molecules similar to those necessary for the emergence of microbes.
