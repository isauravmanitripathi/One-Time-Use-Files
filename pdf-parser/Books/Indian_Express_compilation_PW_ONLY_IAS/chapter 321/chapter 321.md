LONDON, JANUARY 18

BRITISH PRIME Minister Rishi Sunak called on the Upper House of Parliament to "get on board" and pass his plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, a day after surviving a threatened rebellion over the much-criticised legislation by some in his party.

At a press conference when Sunak tried to convince the public his Conservatives were "united" around his plans to tackle illegal immigration, he appealed to the House of Lords to help him start the flights before this year's polls.

It was a clear acknowledgement that Sunak is concerned the unelected Upper House could thwart his attempts to launch his Rwanda plan by trying to introduce changes or even drag out a process he needs to be completed quickly to fulfil his pledge that the flights will start in the spring.

Weakened by the failed rebellion that simply underlined the deep divisions in his party. Sunak repeated his mantra that it was time to "stick with the plan", that his "plan was working" and that the opposition Labour Party had "no plan".

control of our borders and defeat the people smugglers. It's time to restore people's trust that the system is fair," he told journalists.

"I think it's incumbent now on the House of Lords to recognise that, to pass this legislation unamended, as quickly as possible, so that we can then start getting flights up and running."

With the Tories badly trailing Labour in opinion polls and racked by infighting, Sunak sought to take control of the narrative in the party, saying he was making progress on his pledges such as reducing inflation and voters' taxes.

But the failed rebellion has weakened his standing in the party, with those who wanted to bring changes to his Rwanda legislation saying they were angered by Sunak's failure to listen to their concerns.
