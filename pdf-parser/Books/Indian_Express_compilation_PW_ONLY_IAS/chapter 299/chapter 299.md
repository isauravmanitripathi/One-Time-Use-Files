## CHASING MONSOON FOR 150 YEARS The story of India Meteorological Department's origin

| TWO MONSTROUS cyclones in 1864, one              |

| striking Kolkata and the other hitting the       |
| Andhra coast, killed more than one lakh peo-     |
| ple. The loss of lives in the Kolkata cyclone,   |
| possibly the most destructive one till then,     |
| alone was estimated to be over 80,000. Two       |
| years later, in 1866, India faced severe drought |
| and famine, pushing scores of people into        |
| malnutrition and deaths by starvation.           |
| Though events like these were not un-            |
| common in India in those times, the severity     |
| of these particular calamities, more than any-   |
| thing else, exposed the lack of a system of      |
| monitoring atmospheric parameters and            |
| foreseeing their changes. It is these events     |
| that triggered the eventual setting up of the    |
| India Meteorological Department, which on        |
| Monday, January 15, is entering its 150th year   |
| of existence.                                    |
| Though meteorological observations were          |
| being made from several observatories at least   |
| from the 1850s, these were being done largely    |

from the 1850s, these were being done largely<br>by amateurs or the disparate wings of the<br>British colonial system, including the military<br>and the survey office. The Asiatic Society of<br>Bengal, which had been publishing some o
