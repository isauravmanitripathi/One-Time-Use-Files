## Rare metal found in Sutlej sands: What is tantalum, what it is used for

## ALIND CHAUHAN NEW DELHI, NOVEMBER 21

A TEAM of researchers from the Indian<br>Institute of Technology (IIT), Ropar, has<br>found the presence of tantalum, a rare<br>metal, in the Sutlej river sand in Punjab.<br>The discovery has been made by a team<br>headed by Dr Resmi

The metal

The metal<br>
Tantalumis a rare metal with the atomic<br>
number 73 â€” the number of protons found<br>
in one atom of the element. It's grey, heavy,<br>
very hard, and one of the most corrosion-re-<br>
sistant metals in use today. It poss

acid, acidic solutions containing the fluo-<br>ride ion, and free sulphur trioxide," accord-<br>ing to the US Department of Energy.<br>Notably, tantalum also has an extremely<br>high melting point, exceeded only by tung-<br>sten and rhen

The discovery Tantalum was discovered Tantalum was discovered SCIENCE Signitus in Anatolia. Tantalus Swedish chemist, in 1802 in SCIENCE Signitus in Anatolia. Tantalus best known for the terrible minerals obtained from Ytt ment that is chemically similar to tantalum.<br>'The issue was settled in 1866 when Jean

chemist, proved tantalum and niobium were<br>two distinct elements," the US agency said. The name The rare metal has been named after the

derworld, where he forever stood in a pool<br>of water with clusters of fresh fruit hanging

Charles Galissard de Marignac, a Swiss

overhead. Whenever he tried to drink the

overnead. Whenever he tried to pick<br>water, it recorded. Whenever he tried to pick<br>the fruit, the branches drew back.<br>"This name was selected because of the<br>insolubility of tantalum in acids; thus, when<br>placed in the midst ent of Energy added.

## The uses

Tantalum is most prominently used in <br>the electronic sector. The capacitors made <br>from tantalum are capable of storing more <br>electricity in smaller sizes without much <br>leakage compared to any other type of ca-<br>pacitor. Thi

| As tantalum has a high melting point, it        |
| is frequently used as a substitute for plat-    |
| inum, which is more costly. The rare metal is   |
| also used to make components for chemi-         |
| cal plants, nuclear power plants, aeroplanes    |
| and missiles. Tantalum does not react with      |
| bodily fluids and is used to make surgical      |
| equipment and implants, like artificial joints. |
| according to the US Department of Energy.       |
| "A composite consisting of tantalum             |
| carbide (TaC) and graphite is one of the        |
| hardest materials known and is used on the      |
| cutting edges of high-speed machine tools."     |
