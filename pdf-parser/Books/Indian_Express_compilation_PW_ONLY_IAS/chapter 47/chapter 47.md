# Dengue vaccines under development in India: a status report

#### ANONNA DUTT NEW DELHI, AUGUST 27

WITH THE expanding geography of dengue<br>infections in India as well as the work the need<br>has increasingly been felt for a vaccine that can<br>protect against all four serotypes, or strains of<br>the winus. Nearly half the world's

n.fro last year. This year, 31,464 dengue cases and<br>36 deaths have been reported across the coun-<br>try till July, as per the latest data.

Several efforts are underway within the country to develop a vaccine against the mos quito-borne disease, which can cause internal pho-borne disease, which can cause mental <br>seeding, circulatory shock, and death. The <br>lengue wints is called DENV, and its serotype <br>are DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4.

## **Human trials stage**

These versions were developed by The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious<br>Diseases in the US — they deleted parts of the<br>genetic code of DENV1, DENV3, and DENV4<br>and then genetically engineered a DENV2 backbone using parts from the weakened DENV 4. on which the others were tacked.
