# Inequality & social mobility

The winners of 2019 Nobel Prize in Economics spoke to Udit Misra about the most important policy challenges facing India, in fields including education and employment. The laureates, who co-founded The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) in 2003, were speaking on J-PAL's 20th anniversary

ESTHER DUFLO

There are two views on poverty in India. One is that India has eliminated extreme poverty. The other is that poverty has gone up post-Covid. What has fuelled this debate is that we don't have official data on poverty since 2011. What is your view on extreme poverty in India?

Esther Duflo: It's difficult to answer these questions in the absence of data. And it's something that will eventually make it difficult to have an appropriate policy response, because it is necessary to know what is going on to be able to address the problem.

Abhijit Banerjee: Even the (other) data sets that are available, diverge. This is often the reason for an authoritative survey that's credible, and politically insulated, to exist. Every country needs those things.

Duflo: India has a long tradition of excellent infrastructure with the national sample survey organisation â€“ with the flagship survey, the NSS, but also with various surveys. So we kind of go from having very, very regular data with a consistent sampling frame to this state of affairs, where it's hard to say.

#### Is the multidimensional poverty index, being used by the NITI Aayog and the Centre in common discourse, a good substitute for the consumption databased method?

Banerjee: Given that the consumption data is not really there, it's probably a better thing to use, because at least then you focus on infant mortality, maternal mortality, etc., which we can get reliably from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS). So in that sense, this is probably the right direction to go unless we go back to generating reliable. transparent data on consumption.

India has tried different things to alleviate extreme poverty - from giving direct cash or food to focusing on growth and hoping that growth will bring about prosperity. Based on your J-PAL experience, what has worked?

Banerjee: Evidence suggests that the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) worked; there are good evaluations showing it reduced poverty. I am relatively confident, without having seen direct evi dence, that PDS is also doing something for alleviating poverty.

What is harder to say is what is the impact of the more targeted-to-specific-needs schemes - the PM Awas Yojana, for example, or the energy subsidy. That's because it is not clear who exactly is getting them; if they are really about poverty, or about politically navigating a situation where there is lots of inequality and people are resentful.

## Over the years, the issue of inequality seems to have become relatively more important than poverty reduction. Is inequality a bigger concern today?

Banerjee: One thing that's very clear is

that our national policy frame is really not focused on inequality; there is no real discourse about it. And partly, that's a statement about, what is your view of why inequality is important? It needs to be theorised.

It's not clear whether things have got worse or better, because maybe economic inequality was much more limited in the past but social inequality through caste and class was vast. The levels of violence and inequality have, maybe, somewhat mitigated. The political system is more responsive. If the abuse of power was the primary source of inequality, then it is not clear which way things have gone. In many ways, power has shifted from maybe rural landlords to urban businessmen.

But then you could have a very different theory. Inequality is a mechanism that reflects the lack of social mobility. Once, government schools used to be good, and if you were a talented child from a poor family, you had a chance. But that's got harder. There have been some attempts to fix that. For example, Delhi has made a valiant attempt at improving school quality, but in general, the fact is everybody's checking out of the public school system. The fact that the rich can essentially inelastically buy whatever they want means everybody else is facing an unfair competition. So, a different aspect of inequality is just access to the channels of social mobility. The rich parents can invest so much in their children, so out of range for anybody else.

There are other forms of inequality that we don't talk about. For example, poor children have no amenities, they have no place to play, they have no green spaces... And these have long-term consequences on how people grow up, their psychology, etc.

So we need to first start by articulating: what is it that troubles us about inequality? The fact that schools are really a central piece of social mobility, and yet the best private schools get more and more expensive and fancy and create mechanisms for people to hold on to their privilege, is, in the long run, not in the national interest.

#### On education, there are two main concerns: improving outcomes, and addressing unemployability. How do you see the policy landscape in India?

Duflo: The progress on improving educational outcomes has been extremely slow. Especially since we have a sense that it's not rocket science for primary school; it is really a matter of focusing on the basics, and being relentless until every child learns every bit of those basics. It has been demonstrated that it's possible at a huge scale in government schools. It worked even in some of the very poor schools in UP where there was almost nothing. So, given that we have an easy solution, the adoption of that solution has been rather sluggish.

Banerjee: Where we really don't know much is on secondary and post-secondary education. And in particular, there are two issues about employability.

One is that the pedagogy is often designed to suppress curiosity, your own way of thinking or your own way of solving problems - it is extraordinarily routinised. And some work we've done in Uganda suggests you can get huge effects from encouraging children to think on their own. Once you ex posed children to a pedagogy that encourages them to think on their own, the pass rate went up from 50% to 75%.

So a pedagogy that's sort of top-down -'here's the truth; you don't have to think, you have to know what it is'  $-$  is doing damage.

The other thing about employability is expectations. A lot of young people expect that because in their parents' generation education had high returns and they could get a job, they too will get a job. In India, the obsession with government jobs is really counterproductive. People spend the first six, seven years of what would be the working life taking tests, trying to get a job, etc., and then failing and taking some other job.

The Indian labour force participation data looks very strange. At 30, suddenly, everybody, all the males are working. That's reflective of the fact that we have created a system where this obsession with government jobs is hurting employability. People don't want (other) jobs. We did some work with training programmes - people were trained, and then they didn't want the jobs they could get from the training. So this employability issue isn't just a matter of skills, it's a matter of attitudes, and we've created a setting where the attitudes are extraordinarily distorted.

# How to address the expectations issue?

Banerjee: There are probably two sides to this. One is, the government could expand the number of people it employs if it didn't offer the kind of terms it does. For example, in China, there are three people with a Bachelor's degree in every village working for the village government. These are people with certain skills and a certain amount of knowledge of the world.

So one thought is that the government should start introducing maybe a transitional mechanism where you take a job, and then you keep it only if you're good at it. It's like a tenure system. That will create more jobs.

We need more people on the ground. I don't think our government is big enough. A lot of people will say that we have a big government, but in fact, we have a small government that's trying to keep control. The size is small but the hands are heavy. So rethinking the shape of the government, having more young people in government, as a trial<br>as a way to start your life, but then you can go out and do something else, could help.

### NFHS data show that a large proportion of children are stunted and wasted. What can be done to address this?

**Duflo:** There is no one solution that we know would work. Here and there, something makes a difference. For example, in Tamil Nadu, J-PAL experimented with adding a second Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) worker in the anganwadi, with one person focused on nutrition, and that helped a bit. But it was very expensive, and wasn't scaled up.

We are at a loss in terms of solutions, unlike in other countries. In Africa, where countries are much poorer, stunting and wasting of children are improving much faster.

Banerjee: We already knew this was not a poverty problem because the malnutrition rates in some categories of NFHS were worse than the average African child in a very poor country.

If you look at the numbers, protein consumption is extraordinarily low in India. Relative to everywhere in the world, we eat too little protein. We think that daal contains protein, but it's actually very starchy and has very little protein. The reason why it is politically difficult is that telling people they really don't eat the right way is a tricky thing to do.

But on the other hand, here, awareness is critical. In our work, we made up a sitcom to push the use of iron-fortified salt in Bihar, and it was the only thing  $-$  we did many in-<br>terventions  $-$  that worked. So the media really needs to tell people you're not feeding your children the right things.

Eggs have protein, milk has protein. peanut butter has protein. Protein is not hard to get. Vegetarians can get it. But you really need to think about protein as being the thing that we are missing in our diet.

#### It is often said that India doesn't allocate much money in its budget for health and education. Is that a big concern?

Banerjee: On budget allocation for health, even now, India is globally on the low side. On education, we are kind of at the median level for our per capita GDP. The question is more about the allocation towards the elite institutions versus the schools. The distortions are more there than in the total amount of money allocated.

We really need to take the idea of building institutions for social mobility, because in the long run, their absence will lead to a crisis. If people feel they are completely left behind - that there are only poor quality jobs for them and good jobs for a small field of people - that will eventually not work out.
