#### KHADIJA KHAN

NEW DELHI, JANUARY 7

JUSTICE B R GAVAI has been nominated Chairman of the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee (SCLSC), replacing the top court's seniormost puisne judge, Justice Sanjiv Khanna.

The Department of Justice announced Justice Gavai's nomination in exercise of powers conferred by Section 3A of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, read with Rule 10 of the National Legal Service Authority (NALSA) Rules, 1995. The former provision allows a central authority to constitute the SCLSC: the latter deals with the number, experience, and qualifications of members of the SCLSC.

### What is the SCLSC?

The Supreme Court Legal Services Committee was constituted to provide free and competent legal services to the weaker sections of society in cases falling under the jurisdiction of the top court.

The committee comprises a sitting SC judge, who is the chairman, and other members with experience and qualifications prescribed by the Centre.

Under the Act, the chairman and other members will be nominated by the Chief Justice of India (CII), who shall also appoint the Secretary to the committee, having the prescribed experience and qualifications.

Rule 10 of the NALSA Rules lays down the number, experience, and qualification of SCLSC members, Under Section 27 of the 1987 Act, the Centre is empowered to make Rules in consultation with the CII, to carry out the provisions of the Act.

### Members of SCLSC

Under Rule 10 of the NALSA Rules, the SCLSC shall consist of not more than nine members, including ex officio members such as the Attorney General for India; Joint Secretary, Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice; Additional Secretary, Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance, or his nominee; and the Registrar General of the SC.

Under the provision, the Centre can nominate, in consultation with the CII,

other members from among those having the requisite qualifications and experience.

However, only an eminent person in the field of law, a person of repute especially interested in implementing the Legal Services Schemes, or an eminent social worker engaged in the uplift of weaker sections can qualify.

## Why SCLSC is needed

Besides the SLCSC, several other bodies too carry out the task of dispensing free legal services to people across the country at different levels.

Article 39A of the Constitution states, "The State shall secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice, on a basis of equal opportunity, and shall, in particular, provide free legal aid, by suitable legislation or schemes or in any other way, to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities."

Articles 14 and  $22(1)$  make it obligatory for the state to ensure equality before the law, and a legal system that promotes justice based on equal opportunity.

Although the idea of a legal aid programme had been floated since the 1950s. it was finally in 1980 that a committee at the national level was established under the chairmanship of then SC judge, Justice P N Bhagwati. The committee was called the Committee for Implementing Legal Aid Schemes, and started monitoring legal-aid activities throughout India.

#### Dispensing of services

The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, came into force on November 9. 1995, to establish a nationwide uniform network for providing free and competent legal services to the weaker sections.

It also aimed to organise Lok Adalats and constitute legal services authorities.

On December 5, 1995, the NALSA was constituted under the 1987 Act to monitor and evaluate the implementation of legal-aid programmes and to lay down policies and principles for making legal services available under the Act.

Subsequently, in every state, State Legal Services Authorities were established to implement NALSA's policies and directions.
