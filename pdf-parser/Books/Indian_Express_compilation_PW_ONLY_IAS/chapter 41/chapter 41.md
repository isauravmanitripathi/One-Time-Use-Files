## How Moonshot clears way for big & bold

The Moon has become a critical waystation for human's future activity in space â€“ a place to establish a self-sustaining presence and head from there to other parts of the cosmos. The race to the Moon's south pole is based on the expectation that there will be water and other vital ingredients to support human activity.

Realising India's full potential in the space domain demands an overhaul of Delhi's strategy. Five imperatives stand out.

First, as former ISRO chairman K. Sivan put it, the time has come for India to look beyond "frugal engineering" and think big. The Indian space programme gets many compliments for getting such a big bang for its limited budget. But frugal innovation is no longer enough for India to make a difference to global activity on the Moon.

While Chandrayaan took nearly six weeks to get to the Moon, the failed Russian mission Luna-25 arrived there in a week. China's Change-5 launched in 2020 took a week. In 1969, the US Apollo-11 mission, which landed the first men on the Moon, took just four days. The difference is in the power of the rockets. If India wants more impactful Moon projects, it needs bigger budgets and more powerful rockets that can arrive guicker and with heavier payloads to work on the Moon.

That brings us to the second imperative. The massive scale of resources needed for significant space projects means markets must contribute to the space budget, not just the government. India has taken the first steps this year by letting the private sector into the space programme.

This long overdue reform

aligns with the broader global trend. In the second half of the 20thcentury, space activity was state-owned and driven by considerations of nationalism. Today space programmes are animated by commerce, and the private sector has emerged as a much bigger player than the state.

Third, privatisation alone is not enough. It needs to be complemented with international cooperation. There was a reason India had to rely on frugal innovation-technology sanctions. Although India's space programme began with expansive international cooperation, especially with the US and the West, the non-proliferation sanctions that kicked in after India's first nuclear test in May 1974 severely crimped India's space programme.

Many of those sanctions are now gone, thanks to the historic 2005 India-US civil nuclear initiative. India is now part of the missile technology control regime that regulates trade in space technology and is a member of the Wassenaar Arrangement that sets the rules for the transfer of dual-use technologies.

India also recently joined the Artemis Accords, a set of nonbinding space-use principles that the US and several likeminded countries have adopted. The massive cost of space programmes means no country, not even the US or China, can be an effective space player when they act alone.

If past isolation compelled India to develop a purely national space programme, its lunar possibilities can only be realised through space partnerships and joint Moon projects.

Fourth, the talk of international cooperation brings us to the real world of geopolitical competition. Great power rivalry on the Earth has inevitably begun to envelop the Moon. Two competing Moon projects are already at hand. The US is developing the Artemis Mission, with several partners, to land a man and a woman on the Moon by 2025. China has plans to do the same before 2030 and is working with Russia to build an International Lunar Research Station on the Moon.

Given India's growing problems with China, it appears unlikely that Delhi will team up with Beijing on the Moon in the near term. It then needs to embark on a serious negotiation with the US on the possible terms of mutually beneficial Indian participation in the Artemis Mission.

Finally, with outer space and the Moon set for an increased range of activity, Delhi needs laws - domestic as well as international - for its effective promotion and regulation. India must also pay serious attention to shaping the global governance of space. Delhi played a key role at the UN in drafting the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, India is among the states that signed the 1979 Moon Treaty. That regime is now under stress amidst changing technology, growing human activity in space, and mounting great power rivalries.

While geopolitical rivalry is a reality. Delhi must work to limit competition and expand cooperation in outer space.
