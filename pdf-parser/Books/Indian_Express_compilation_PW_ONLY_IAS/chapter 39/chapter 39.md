### Special mission

Indian scientists have<br>so far observed the Sun<br>through telescopes on<br>the ground and referion data from solar missions data from solar missions<br>launched by the United<br>States, Europe, the United<br>States, Europe, the United<br>Kingdom, and Japan.<br>"All these years, India<br>has been observing the

Aditya-L1<br>presents a unique oppor-<br>tunity to not only address<br>the existing gaps but also complement with reserv complement with newer<br>data to address the un-<br>solved problems in solar<br>physics," Prof Dipankar<br>Banerjee, director of the<br>Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational
