## SC asks Govt to set up fresh delimitation commission

For proportional representation of communities specified as SCs and STs

## PRESS TRUST OF INDIA NEW DELHI, NOVEMBER 23

THE SUPREME Court directed the Centre on Thursday to set up a fresh delimitation commission for ensuring a proportional representation of the communities specified as Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), as mandated under the Constitution.

While asking the Centre to set up the panel, the top court, however, said it cannot direct Parliament to amend or make laws for giving proper representation to other communities that form a part of the STs as that would amount to "venturing into the legislative domain".

"For the court to direct that in addition to the reservation made... Parliament must legislate to enact proportional representation for all other communities forming part of Scheduled Tribes, that would be venturing into the legislative domain," it said.

The directions were issued by a bench of Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra on a plea seeking a proportionate representation of the Limbu and Tamang tribal communities in the Assemblies of Sikkim and West Bengal.

"We have made it clear that they (Centre) have to set up the delimitation commission," the bench said.

It said the apex court has the power of judicial review to determine whether a provision enacted by Parliament is unconstitutional, but "this court will go

beyond the line".

Dealing with proportionate representation of communities in the West Bengal Assembly, the bench said it would require using the power under the Delimitation Act, 2002.

The law provides for a readjustment of the allocation of seats in state Assemblies, the total number of Assembly seats and the division of each state and Union Territory having a legislative Assembly.

"In regard to the state of West Bengal, it has been submitted that... additional seats have to be made available in the state Assembly for the Scheduled Tribes in order to accommodate the principle of proportional representation," the bench said.

"The above circumstance makes it abundantly necessary for the Centre to take recourse to power under the Delimitation Act, 2002 to ensure that the provisions under Articles 332 and 333 of the Constitution are duly implemented," it added.

The bench made it clear that its verdict "shall not be read to interfere with the elections to Parliament or state Assemblies since elections are an overarching mandate and they have to be carried out on time".

Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing in the court on behalf of the NGO - Public Interest Committee for Scheduling Specific Areas (PICSSA) - had earlier claimed that there was a rise in the ST population in Sikkim and West Bengal and not reserving seats for them proportionate to the growth amounted to a denial of their constitutional rights.
