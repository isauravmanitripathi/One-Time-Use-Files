NEW DELHI, JANUARY 12

AFTER HIS roadshow in Nashik. Maharashtra, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday visited the Kala Ram Mandir on the banks of the Godavari in the Panchavati area of the city.

A day earlier, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhay Thackeray had said he would spend January  $22$  â€“ the day of the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple in  $A yodhya - at the temple.$ 

The temple is also the site of a landmark agitation led by Babasaheb Ambedkar, demanding temple entry rights for Dalits more than 90 years ago.

### Panchavati in the Ramayana

A number of important events described in the epic took place here. Ram, along with Sita and Lakshman, spent the first few years of their 14-year exile in Dandakaranya, the dense forest in central India of which Panchavati was a part.

The name Panchavati comes from the existence of five banyan trees in the area. According to the epic, Lord Ram, Sita, and Lakshman set up a hut here as the presence of five banyan trees made this spot auspicious.

It is from the Panchavati region that Ravan, the demon king of Lanka, abducted Sita.

## Important Dalit satyagraha

In 1930, B R Ambedkar and the Marathi teacher and social activist Pandurang Sadashiv Sane, known as Sane Guruji, led an agitation to demand access for Dalits to Hindu temples.

On March 2, 1930, Ambedkar organised a large protest outside the Kala Ram temple. Dalit protesters arrived in Nashik in trucks, and surrounded the temple with a sit-in. Over the next few days, they sang songs, raised slogans, and demanded the right to enter the temple.

The protesters faced opposition, and there was an incident of stone-throwing

when they tried to stop a Ram Navami procession from entering the temple premises. Babasaheb reached the spot and controlled the situation, according to an account of the satyagraha in Dhananjay Keer's book, Dr Ambedkar: Life and Mission (1954).

The satyagraha at the Kala Ram temple continued until 1935. Keer wrote.

## Unusual statue of Lord Ram

The Kala Ram temple derives its name from a black statue of the Lord - Kala Ram translates literally to "Black Ram". The sanctum sanctorum has statues of Ram, Sita, and Lakshman, and a black idol of Hanuman at the main entrance.

The temple was built in 1792 with the efforts of one Sardar Rangarao Odhekar, according to the website of the Shree Kalaram Mandir Sansthan. It says that Sardar Odhekar dreamt of a blackcoloured statue of Lord Ram in the Godavari, and recovered the statues from the river and built the temple.

The main temple has 14 steps, which represent the 14 years of Ram's exile. It has 84 pillars, which represents the cycle of 84 lakh species that one has to complete in order to be born as a human. LONGER VERSION
