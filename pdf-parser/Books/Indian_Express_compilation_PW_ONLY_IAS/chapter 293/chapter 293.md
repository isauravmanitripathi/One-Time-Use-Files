## Need legislative change for group insolvency framework: RBI's Das

## ENS ECONOMIC BUREAU MUMBAI, JANUARY 11

RESERVE BANK of India Governor Shaktikanta Das Thursday batted for a specified framework for the group insolvency mechanism and a vibrant market for stressed assets in the country to improve the working of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).

In the absence of a specified framework, the group insolvency mechanism has been evolving under the guidance of the courts. said Das. "Perhaps the time has come for laying down appropriate principles in this regard through legislative changes," he said at a conference on IBC organised by the Centre for Advanced Financial Learning (CAFRAL).

"There has been quite a bit of brainstorming on this issue in the policy circles for some time now. The task now is to move forward through appropriate legal changes," Das said.

He also pointed out challenges in this process: intermingling of assets, devising a definition of a 'group' and addressing cross-border aspects. "It would still be preferable to see the opportunity here and put in place a workable framework for group insolvency," Das said.

On stressed assets, Das said

## 'RBI closely studying algo-based lending by banks and NBFCs'

Mumbai: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das Thursday raised concerns over algorithm-based lending by banks and NBFCs and said there is a need for a continuous testing of such models to prevent any possible build-up of risk.

The RBI is closely watching the model-based lending approach which banks and NBFCs are relying on.

"This model-based algorithm or the model-based lending is one area where currently we are looking at," Das said while speaking at a banking event organised by Mint.

He said the management. board of directors and the audit committees or the risk management committees of banks and NBFCs need to see how robust the algorithms and the models are. Ground realities keep on changing and so, banks and NBFCs should check whether their model is falling behind the curve, or it is in tune with the times, and what are the possible risks the models can create, Das said.

He also exuded confidence that the Indian banking system is well placed to support the country's growth. "The remarkable turnaround in the Indian banking system has been the cornerstone of India's success story in recent years," Das said. ENS

one major impediment for implementing a successful resolution plan has been the absence of a vibrant market for stressed assets in the country. "This effectively limits the pool of prospective resolution applicants for stressed assets under IBC," he said.

Any amendments to the Code and its evolution thereof may continue to lay emphasis on

a financial creditor-led resolution framework, in an overarching manner, he said.

Das said creditors have realised Rs 3.16 lakh crore out of the admitted claims of Rs 9.92 lakh crore as of September 2023, which works out to a recovery rate of 32 per cent. "It needs to be emphasised here that significant value destruction would have already happened in these assets prior to their admission under the IBC," he said.

The credible 'threat of insolvency' ignited by the code has strengthened the negotiating powers of the creditors, in the absence of which it is most likely that those defaults would have lingered for much longer, resulting in value destruction, he said.

Das said the criticisms of the IBC are on two fronts - the time taken for resolution and the extent of haircuts vis-Ã -vis the admitted claims.

The code envisages a timebound process, requiring the completion of CIRP within 180 days, with a one-time extension by up to 90 days in exceptional circumstances.

However, the data published by the IBBI raises certain serious concerns. As of September 2023, 67 per cent of the ongoing CIRP cases have already crossed the total timeline of 270 days including possible extension period of 90 days. "More concerning is the fact that, the average time taken for admission of a case during FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22 stood at 468 days and 650 days respectively. Such a long degree of delays will substantially erode the value of the assets," Das said.
