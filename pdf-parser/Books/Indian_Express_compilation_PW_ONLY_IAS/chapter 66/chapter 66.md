## **4 CATEGORIES: BHATNAGAR AWARDS STAY** Science awards to be called Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar

## ANONNA DUTT NEW DELHI, SEPTEMBER 20

A YEAR after it decided to do away with all the different awards being given by its science departments, even withholding the Bhatnagar awards for the year, the government has finalised an alternative system for honouring its scientists and researchers.

It has instituted four categories of awards, to be collectively called Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar that would be "one of the highest recognition in the field of science, technology and innovation in India". The Bhatnagar awards have been retained but will now be called Vigyan Yuva Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar awards in keeping with its mandate of recognising scientific excellence among researchers below the age of 45 years. The Bhatnagar awards would now be given in 13 disciplines, instead of the current seven, and a maximum of 25 awards can be given every year, instead of the current 14.

Vigyan Ratna will be given to scientists for lifetime achievement while Vigyan Shri will recognise scientific contributions from scientists of all ages. A Vigyan Team award has been instituted to recognise collaborative efforts of scientific groups.

Like the new Bhatnagar awards, the other categories of awards would also be given in 13 disciplines - physics, chemistry, biological sciences, mathematics and computer science, earth science, medicine, engineering sciences, agricultural science, environmental science, technology and innovation, atomic energy. space science and technology. among others.

The Bhatnagar awards used to be given by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), but now all the Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskars will come from the Department of Science and Technology.

The awards will commence 2024 onwards.

A maximum of three Vigyan Ratnas and three Vigyan Teams are proposed to be awarded every year, while Vigyan Shri and Vigyan Yuva Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar awards can be given to 25 scientists each.

Nominations for the awards will be accepted every year between January 14 and February 28 (National Science Day), and announced every year on National Technology Day (May 11). The award ceremony, on the other hand, will be held every year on National Space Day (August 23) to mark the day India's Chandrayaan-3 landed on the moon.

All internal awards, except for a one named after Homi Jehangir Bhabha given by the Department of Atomic Energy, "have been dispensed", it is learnt. The internal award will be given to 30 recipients in the form of certificates.

The awardees will be selected by a committee under the chairmanship of the Principal Scientific Adviser. The Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar Committee will be constituted of all secretaries of all six science departments, four presidents selected from science and engineering academies, and six distinguished scientists and technologists from different fields of science.

This committee will be constituted every year, with the committee member ineligible for the award during their tenure. The awards processes will be carried out by the CSIR for the first two years and will be taken over by the newly instituted National Research Foundation.

This is in line with the government's effort to "rationalise" awards in science and technology.

MoS Science and Technology Jitendra Singh said: "We have not discontinued awards, we have rationalised them. We have reduced the numbers to add to the sanctity and value of the awards. After all, a coveted award has to be coveted."
