TODAY MARKS 365 days since India assumed the G20 presidency. It is a moment to reflect, recommit, and rejuvenate the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam - "One Earth, One Family, One Future"

As we undertook this responsibility last year, the global landscape grappled with multifaceted challenges: Recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, looming climate threats, financial instability, and debt distress in developing nations - all amid declining multilateralism. In the midst of conflicts and competition, development cooperation suffered, impeding progress.

Assuming the G20 chair, India sought to offer the world an alternative to the status quo. a shift from a GDP-centric to humancentric progress. India aimed to remind the world of what unites us, rather than what divides us. Finally, the global conversation had to evolve - the interests of the few had to give way to the aspirations of the many. This re quired a fundamental reform of multilateralism as we knew it.

Inclusive, ambitious, action-oriented, and decisive - these four words defined our approach as G20 president, and the New Delhi Leaders' Declaration (NDLD), unani mously adopted by all G20 members, is tes timony to our commitment to deliver on

these principles.<br>Inclusivity has been at the heart of our presidency. The inclusion of the African Union (AU) as a permanent member of the G20 integrated 55 African nations into the forum, expanding it to encompass 80 per cent of the global population. This proactive stance has fostered a more comprehensive dialogue on global challenges and opportunities

The first-of-its-kind 'Voice of the Global<br>South Summit', convened by India in two editions, heralded a new dawn for multilateral ism. India mainstreamed the Global South's concerns in the international discourse and has ushered in an era where developing countries take their rightful place in shaping the global narrative.

Inclusivity also infused India's domestic approach to G20, making it a People's Presidency that befits the world's largest democracy. Through "Jan Bhagidari" (people's participation) events, the G20 reached 1.4 billion citizens, involving all states and Union Territories (UTs) as partners. And on substantive elements. India ensured that international attention was directed to broader developmental aims, aligning with the G20's mandate.

At the critical midpoint of the 2030 genda, India delivered the G20 2023 Action Plan to Accelerate Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), tak ing a cross-cutting, action-oriented approach to interconnected issues, including health, education, gender equality and environmental sustainability.

A key area driving this progress is the robust Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). Here India was decisive in its recommendations having witnessed the revolutionary impact of digital innovations like Aadhaar, UPI, and

Digilocker first-hand. Through the G20, w successfully completed the Digital Public Infrastructure Repository, a significant stride in global technological collaboration. This repository, featuring over 50 DPIs from 16 ountries, will help the Global South build dopt, and scale DPI to unlock the power of inclusive growth.

For our One Earth, we introduced ambitious and inclusive aims to create urgent, last-<br>ing, and equitable change. The Declaration's Green Development Pact addresses the challenges of choosing between combating hunger and protecting the planet, by outlining a comprehensive roadmap where employment and ecosystems are complimentary, consumption is climate-conscious, and production is planet-friendly. In tandem, the 20 Declaration calls for an ambitious tripling of global renewable energy capacity by 2030 Coupled with the establishment of the Global Biofuels Alliance and a concerted push for reen Hydrogen, the G20's ambitions to build cleaner, greener world are undeniable. This as always been India's ethos, and through Lifestyles for Sustainable Development (LiFE) he world can benefit from our age-old sus tainable traditions.

Further, the Declaration underscores our ommitment to climate justice and equity inging substantial financial and technol support from the Global North. For the first time, there was a recognition of the quantum jump needed in the magnitude of development financing, moving from billions to trilions of dollars. The G20 acknowledged that leveloping countries require \$5.9 trillion to fulfil their Nationally Determined<br>Contributions (NDCs) by 2030.

Given the monumental resources required, the G20 emphasised the importance During our G20 Presidency, India led deliberations on geopolitical issues and their impact on economic growth and development. Terrorism and the senseless killing of civilians are unacceptable. and we must address them with a policy of zero tolerance. We must embody humanitarianism over hostility and reiterate that this is not an era of war.

better, larger, and more effective Development Multilateral Banks Concurrently, India is taking a leading role in UN reforms, especially in the restructuring of principal organs like the UN Security Council, that will ensure a more equitable global order.

Gender equality took centre stage in the Declaration, culminating in the formation of a dedicated Working Group on the Empowerment of Women next year. India's Women's Reservation Bill 2023, reserving one third of India's Parliament and state legislative assembly seats for women, epitomises our commitment to women-led development,

The New Delhi Declaration embodies a renewed spirit of collaboration across these key priorities, focusing on policy coherence, reliable trade, and ambitious climate action. It is a matter of pride that during our presidency G20 achieved 87 outcomes and 118 adopted documents, a marked rise from the pas

During our G20 presidency, India led deliberations on geopolitical issues and their impact on economic growth and development. Terrorism and the senseless killing of civilians are unacceptable, and we must address them with a policy of zero tolerance. We must embody humanitarianism over hostility and reiterate that this is not an era of war.

I am delighted that during our presidency, India achieved the extraordinary: It revitalised multilateralism, amplified the voice of the Global South, championed development, and fought for the empowerment of women everywhere.

As we hand over the G20 presidency to Brazil, we do so with the conviction that our collective steps for people, planet, peace, and prosperity, will resonate for years to come.
