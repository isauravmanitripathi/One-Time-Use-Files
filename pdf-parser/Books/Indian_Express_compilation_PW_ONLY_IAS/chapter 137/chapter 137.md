Last week, the Bihar government released the results of its caste survey. It has touched off a larger question, ahead of 2024. Is a caste census necessary and urgent? To what end?

## Count

## Caste census is necessary for any policy to reduce social inequality. Even critics of reservation should welcome it

LET US BEGIN with the X-ray question. Are you for it, or against it? A reasonable answer would be, "It depends. Normally yes, if it is required and possible. But in some cases no, if it is risky or unaffordable." This commonsense can guide us on the caste census too.

We have here five considerations for endorsing or opposing an investigation or evidence collection exercise like the caste census. One, there should be, prima facie, a problem, a disease or a condition. Two, the investigation should be relevant to that condition and expected to yield information that can help the diagnosis. Three, it should be feasible in the real-life conditions and time available. Four, the material cost of the investigation should not be impossible. And five, the investigation should itself be not so risky that its side effects outweigh its possible benefits. Apply these to the caste census and you know why such enumeration is not just permissible, but essential

The first point is self-evident: Caste appears to be an issue in Indian society. From the left to the right, every thinker, ideology

or party says that the cast system is a disease, that caste inequalities need to be eradicated. So, prima facie there is a condition that merits investigation.

The second point needs clarity about what a caste census is and what it does. Most opponents of the caste census - as also many supporters - assume that it is just a simple head count of different castes. Actually, a census is a store-house of multi-dimensional and multi-layered information. It records the age, sex, education and occupation of each person. It also records for each household the type

of house, source of electricity and water, type of cooking fuel and assets like four-wheeler and computer. So a caste census would reveal not just the population of each caste, but also their educational, social and economic profile. And this information would be available at the national, state, district and lower levels right down to each family.

This data is not only relevant, but necessary for any well designed policy to reduce social inequality. The census provided us the data we need on gender hierarchy, on ruralurban inequality and even on the disparity among religious communities. The only piece missing from this data basket is castebased inequalities other than SC and ST. This is an absolute must for any fine-tuning or re-<br>view of the reservation policy. It is a scandal, perhaps unparalleled in any country that follows affirmative action, to have a legal regime of reservation for a group we refuse to count!

Granular socio-economic profile of each caste should help settle intractable questions: Has caste ceased to be a key vector of inequal-

ity? Should reservation be based only on cast or on economic status or both? Have a few castes captured the OBC quota? Should there be sub-quotas within OBC reservation? What, if any, should be the cutoff for the creamy layer? So, any honest critic of caste-based reservation should demand the caste census as much as its supporters. The caste census would also place under the sunlight authentic information about the privilege enjoyed, or<br>not, by the "upper caste" Hindus, a social group everyone recognises but the Indian state refuses to categorise. This should be the benchmark to measure social inequalities

As for feasibility, Bihar has shown what professionals always knew: A caste census was not as difficult as it was made out to be. If Bihar could carry it out and publish the data in a few months, so can the country. If Bihar can afford it, so can the country. If held with the general census, caste enumeration is just about adding one extra column. The additional cost would be minuscule.

Finally, let us consider a possible side ef-<br>fect: Caste census could accentuate caste<br>consciousness and caste cleavages. There is some merit to this concern, if it is not overplayed. We need to remember that everyone in a village and basti knows everyone's caste and that every politician walks with an unofficial caste count of each polling booth. We should also ask why regular census enumeration of language and religion and, in-<br>deed, of castes within SC and ST has not caused the explosion that is feared from the enumeration of OBCs and upper castes.

Here are three ways to mitigate this possible side effect. One, articulate the demand for caste census as an element in a larger multi-dimensional ideoleffect: Caste census ogy of social justice that includes gender, class and locaste consciousness cation. Two, develop a cross-party consensus. And three, concede it quietly, should also ask why rather than create a national row about it. In any case,<br>this limited side effect cannot outweigh all the benelanguage and religion fits outlined above. has not caused such an

Finally, let us go back to the X-ray and note some arguments that fly in the face of any commonsense. We know that we cannot wish

away a fracture by not carrying out an X-ray. But why do we allow critics of the caste census to pretend that caste would disappear if we don't recognise it through a formal census? We don't discuss the doctor's motives in prescribing an X-ray, unless we know for sure that it is unnecessary and exorbitant. Then why is the debate on the caste census so focused about the motives of politicians, as if those who oppose it have no political motives? Finally, we think it is perverse to say "Let's not do an X-ray, lest it reveal a serious condition that requires an operation". So how do we allow this logic on the caste census: Let us not carry out a caste census, for it might lead to demands for more reservation?

Such perverse reasoning suggests we are <br>up against centuries of entrenched privilege. Caste census would help break this stranglehold, realise the constitutional promise of equality of opportunities and move towards Babasaheb's dream of annihilation of caste.

## Don't count

This is not the time to expand reservation. India is ready for simultaneous pursuit of justice, equality, excellence

![](_page_0_Picture_23.jpeg)

A GOOD DEMOCRACY doesn't weigh citizens but counts them. Everybody is equal and judged as individuals, not as a member of<br>groups. The challenge lies in the gap between this ideal and the reality every society tries to bridge through policy. But is discrimina-<br>tion between applicants for jobs and education the most effective policy tool to deliver<br>equality? Is it possible to discriminate in favour of one group without discriminating against another? It's hardly time to end reservation but expanding it - the Bihar caste survey is a cynical attempt to do so  $-$  is unfair to future generations and divisive. Radically<br>rebooting India's infrastructure of opportunity, employment, employability and edu-

cation offers a powerful policy alternative to reservation without dividing society. Laws that make discrimination based on aste, gender, and religion illegal (which should always exist) find it hard to coexist with reservation policies that discriminate<br>based on caste, gender and religion (which should always be temporary, if justified). An argument against reservation doesn't imply the 299 remarkable innova-

tors who wrote our Constitution did something wrong or unnecessary by introducing reservation. They recognised that voting <br>was only one step in creating equality and that some discrimination, though undemocratic, was temporarily necessary. I have also heard reasonable arguments that 75 years are in-<br>sufficient to right centuries of historical wrongs.

As every doctor knows, the dose makes the poison. Anything powerful enough to help has the power to hurt if the dosage is too

small or for too long. The<br>many decades since Independence need us to expand our goals to pursue equality and excellence. Equality without excellence is neither sustainable nor satisfying. Pursuing both means a new definition of equality. That means equal treatment, unbiased competition and impartially judged outcomes, not equal outcomes achieved by unequal treatment, biased competition and preferential judging. This pursuit needs to shift from discriminating between children based on their parents to creating the infrastructure of opportunity that allows the pursuit of excellence and judging them on the sweat of their brow and the courage in their heart.

Rebooting our infrastructure of opportunity requires accelerating reforms to our 3Es<br>of education, employability, and employment. But I suggest three low-hanging fruits In education, state governments must fix government schools without wasting more energy on small class sizes, teacher qualifications or teacher salaries but focusing on the binding constraints of performance management (fear of falling and hope of rising),<br>governance (allocation of decision rights), and soft skills

In employability, we must attract massive new financing for skills from employers by redesigning the system around the five de ign principles of learning by doing, learning while earning, learning with qualification modularity, learning with multimodal deliv ery, and learning with signalling value. This<br>requires ending regulatory cholesterol that restricts linking degrees to apprenticeships, confuses apprenticeships with jobs, judges vocational universities like traditional ones and blunts online higher education growth.

In employment, massive non-farm, highwage, formal job creation requires cutting the<br>regulatory cholesterol for employers that breeds litigation, compliance, filings and criminalisation by passing new labour codes. There is a lot of work in manufacturing, less anchored to large employers with offices, and mostly without index-linked, defined benefit pensions. But our current labour laws hate small employers, breed corruption, and encourage substituting people with machines.

Many academics position jobs and skills as a chicken-and-egg problem: Do jobs breed skills? Or do skills attract jobs? It's a bit of both. But from a practitioner's perspective, the best way to solve such a problem is to become vegetarian, that is, do something different. State governments must pursue fis-<br>cal discipline, macroeconomic stability, good urbanisation, lower self-exploitation in selfemployment, with only 10 per cent of their labour working in farms.

A modern state is a welfare state and being a good ancestor requires a government that uses society's resources to subsidise and dequality líver food. education, healthcare and housing to those who need it. But this safety net should not become a hammock: Unemployed workers cannot get the same income as those working because people get much more from work than income. And rich people should not get cheap food, gas or diesel. Policy must accelerate the Aadhaar-enabled Direct Benefit Transfer revolution

for subsidies. This digital and financial plumbing must combine with a new HR regime for 25 million civil servants because the effective and efficient delivery of public services also matters greatly for equality.

Gandhiji believed that Sarvodaya (develpment of all) would be accomplished through Antyodaya (welfare of the weak).<br>Philosophers have built on his thinking and concluded that if you were designing the world without knowing your place in it, you would ensure fairness for all. Reservation is valuable tool for social justice but after years of Poorna Swaraj, it's time to discard something often subject to political manipulation for something more universal over the next few decades. India is ready for the simulta-<br>neous pursuit of justice, equality, excellence. ndians should create a glide path to reach 100 years of Independence with 100 per cent eservation for 100 per cent of its people.
