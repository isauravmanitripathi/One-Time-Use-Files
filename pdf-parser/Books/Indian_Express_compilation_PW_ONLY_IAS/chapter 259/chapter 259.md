Unprecedented

The postponement

The postponement is due to the unre-<br>ved dispute between ISCA and the DST.<br>In September 2023, the DST withdrew

its funding support to the congress, alleging

its infinite support to the congress, alleging <br>"financial irregularities". ISCA denied the ac-<br>cusation and challenged the DST's directive <br>that government funds shouldn't be spent <br>on anything related to the Science Cong
