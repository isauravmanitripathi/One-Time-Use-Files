## NOT SO DIGITAL INDIA

Internet shutdown in Manipur violates fundamental rights, SC ruling

## NAMRATA MAHESHWARI AND SHRUTI NARAYAN

NEARLY THREE months after an internet shutdown was imposed across Manipur, people still do not have unhampered access. On July 25, the state government permitted limited and conditional access but did not restore connectivity in a meaningful way.

Mobile internet services, which have far greater penetration than broadband, particularly in rural areas, and are used by more than 90 per cent of India's internet subscribers, remain suspended. Less than 5 per cent - largely urban and institutional users - have access to fixed-line internet, which has now been permitted. This has deepened the digital divide. It also contradicts the government's Digital India vision. How can there be a meaningful push for digital public infrastructure when an entire state can be cut off from the internet and the ability of millions in India to access online services, avail the benefits of government schemes and make digital payments is routinely impacted by shutdowns? With 51 shutdowns, and counting, in 2023, India is on its way to retaining the title of the global leader in internet shutdowns for the sixth year. At this rate, Digital India's nagriks will be the privileged fraction who can afford broadband and live in regions fortunate to have connectivity. India cannot drive change, including through the G20 presidency, if it continues to ban access to an open and secure internet.

The ban on social media continues in

The Manipur government seems to have learned the worst lessons from the Jammu and Kashmir communications blockade of 2019-2020. The Centre imposed a complete internet shutdown for six months, and gradually lifted suspensions after a court intervention. However, the government is simultaneously ignoring the law that resulted from the Kashmir shutdown.

Manipur. Internet access is also conditional on static IPs and a ban on Virtual Private Networks. These measures enable surveillance of all online activities and tracing users' locations while impeding the exercise of the rights to free expression, freedom of assembly and privacy amid the crisis. Lack of access to an open and secure internet and social media affects the flow of information, weakens reporting, and the ability to hold those responsible for the ongoing violence accountable.

The Constitution guarantees the right to free expression. This right can only be limited in a reasonable and proportionate manner. Restricting people's ability to connect, and then effectively bringing all the ways in which they can connect under surveillance, is neither reasonable nor proportionate.

Connectivity restrictions directly contribute to economic loss and unemployment. For instance, the six-month communication blockade in Kashmir in 2019 left more than five lakh people unemployed. Rajasthan saw losses of Rs 800 crore due to shutdowns over one month in 2021. At the country level, one estimate suggests that internet shutdowns in 2022 cost over Rs 1,500 crore. In just the first half of 2023, shutdowns have already cost more - an estimated Rs 2,091 crore. These figures understate the problem because not all shutdowns are reported, and they do not account for the unorganised sector. So, they do not consider the disproportionate impact on sections of the society that engage more with the informal sector, including women.

Impunity and lack of answers from authorities remain an issue. On July 26, the Centre was asked in Parliament about the number of shutdowns in the last three years. estimated losses, and whether it intended to do anything to minimise losses. The query did not yield any concrete answer. State authorities must be accountable for their shutdown orders. However, the responsibility to reform the legal framework authorising the imposition of shutdowns through the rules of the Telegraph Act, and implementing rights-respecting changes, rests with the Centre.

The Manipur government seems to have learned the worst lessons from the Jammu and Kashmir communications blockade of 2019-2020. The Centre imposed a complete internet shutdown for six months, and gradually lifted suspensions after a court intervention. However, the government is simultaneously ignoring the law that resulted from the Kashmir shutdown. The Supreme Court, in huradha Bhasin v Union Of India, held that shutdowns violate fundamental rights. They may be imposed only when it is proportional, reasonable, necessary, and the least restrictive measure, and never be indefinite. Three years later, little has changed.
