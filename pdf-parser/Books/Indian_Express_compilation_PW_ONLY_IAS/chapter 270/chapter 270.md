## PRESS TRUST OF INDIA

NEW DELHI, JANUARY 5

THE GOVERNMENT Friday approved an initiative that will give it the flexibility to pursue research and use funds allocated to five different sub-schemes related to earth sciences over a five-year period.

The funds at the disposal of the Ministry of Earth Sciences are Rs 4,797 crore which collates allocations to the sub-schemes.

The sub-schemes are 'Atmosphere and Climate Research-Modelling Observing Systems and Services', 'Ocean Services, Modelling Application, Resources and Technology', 'Polar Science and Cryosphere Research',

'Seismology and Geosciences' and 'Research, Education, Training and Outreach'. The new initiative, approved by the Union Cabinet at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will be called 'PRITHVI' and will allow the ministry to award research projects to overseas institutes.

"With the PRITHVI initiative, we are looking at earth system sciences as one unit, instead of separate verticals such as atmosphere, cryosphere, geosphere, ocean science. This will allow us to take up cross-disciplinary projects and even use funds allocated for the separate verticals together," a senior official said.

"The scheme will also facilitate ease of doing research," the official added.
