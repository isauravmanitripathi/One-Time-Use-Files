# Falling farm exports: concerns

While the effects of bans and restrictions on rice, wheat and sugar shipments are being felt in declining agri exports from India, imports are continuing unhindered. This is hurting farmers

INDIA'S AGRICULTURAL exports have fallen 11.6% year-on-year in April-September. This comes on the back of the Narendra Modi government imposing bans/restrictions on the shipments of various commodities - from wheat and rice to sugar - and global prices easing from their peaks scaled immediately after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

According to department of commerce data, exports of farm commodities, at \$23.6 billion in April-September 2023, were below \$26.7 billion for April-September 2022. Imports fell too, from \$19.3 billion to \$16.2 billion, resulting in a marginal dip in the agricultural trade surplus (exports minus imports) from \$7.4 billion in April-September 2022 to \$7.2 billion in 2023.

The country's farm exports touched alltime-highs of \$50.2 billion in 2021-22 (April-March) and \$53.2 billion in 2022-23, reversing a declining trend from 2013-14 to 2020-21. The years 2021-22 and 2022-23 also saw record imports of \$32.4 billion and \$35.7 billion respectively (chart). The current fiscal, in a sense, marks a return to normal with both exports and imports contracting.

## The impact of global prices India's farm trade, especially exports, is strongly correlated with world prices.

The UN Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Food Price Index (FPI) rose from an average of 96.5 points in 2019-20 and 102.5 points in 2020-21 to 133 points in 2021-22 and 139.5 points in 2022-23. In the current fiscal (from April till October 2023), the FPI has averaged 123.2 points.

India's agricultural exports fell from \$43.3 billion in 2013-14 to \$35.6 billion in 2019-20 along with the FPI, and rose thereafter with the index soaring to unprecedented levels in 2022-23.

With world prices since coming down, the value of both exports and imports of farm commodities are set to decline in 2023-24. This comes even as supply disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine war have eased. In its latest supply and demand brief, the FAO has projected global ending cereal stocks for 2023-24 at an all-time-high of 881.1 million tonnes (mt) and the stocks-to-use ratio at

# The impact of export curbs

Easing global prices apart, a second reason for falling farm exports has to do with government restrictions, in response to domestic availability and inflation concerns.

In May 2022, the government banned exports of wheat. In September 2022, exports of broken rice were prohibited and a 20% duty levied on all white (non-parboiled) nonbasmati grain shipments. In July 2023, exports of white non-basmati rice were banned altogether.

In August 2023, a 20% duty was clamped

on exports of parboiled non-basmati rice too. while basmati shipments were subjected to minimum export price (MEP) curbs.

In May 2022, the government moved sugar exports from the "free" to the "restricted" category, capping the quantity of the sweetener that could go out. Since May 2023, exports have stopped completely, with no fresh quotas for shipments being issued.

The effects of these measures can be seen in table 1. In 2021-22. India exported an alltime-high 7.24 mt of wheat valued at \$2.1 billion. In 2022-23, exports of rice (non-basmati plus basmati) rose to a record 22.35 mt worth a whopping \$11.1 billion. In the current fiscal (April-September), wheat exports have plunged to negligible levels, while nonbasmati rice posted a 15.9% year-on-year decline. Sugar exports have more than halved, after letching \$4.6 billion and \$5.8 billion in 2021-22 and 2022-23 respectively.

# **Concerns for farmers**

Declining international prices not only lower the cost competitiveness of the country's agricultural exports, but also make its farmers more vulnerable to imports. This is being witnessed in cotton and edible oils.

The benchmark global Cotlook 'A' Index price for cotton is currently quoting at 91.80 cents per pound, from the high of 173.45 cents attained on May 5, 2022. The price crash has led to India's cotton exports not only plummeting, from \$2.8 billion in 2021-22 to \$781.4 million in 2022-23, but also imports surging 2.5 times from \$559.6 million to \$1.4 billion (table 2). This transformation from a net exporter to net importer is reflected in the prices of kapas (raw un-ginned cotton): Rs 7,000-7,100 per quintal in Gujarat's Rajkot market now, as against Rs 9,000-9,100 a year ago and Rs 12,000-plus in May 2022.<br>The value of India's edible oil imports

more than doubled from  $$9.7$  billion to  $$20.8$ billion between 2019-20 and 2022-23. This was primarily due to skyrocketing global prices, particularly post the war in Ukraine. Prices have since collapsed, but imports of crude palm, soyabean and sunflower oil are still coming in at a low 5.5% duty.

Soyabean is trading at Rs 4,700-4,800 per quintal in the mandis of Madhya Pradesh, compared with Rs 5,300-5,400 at this time last year. However, the Modi government's focus on controlling food inflation ahead of national elections - and privileging the interests of consumers over producers - means that imports of edible oil and pulses will continue unhindered, alongside restrictions on exports of cereals, sugar and even onion.

For farmers, that would be a double whammy.
