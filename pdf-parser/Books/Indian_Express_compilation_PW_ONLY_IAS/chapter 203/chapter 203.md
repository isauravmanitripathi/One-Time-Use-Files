## Frame policy for online sale of drugs within 8 weeks: Delhi HC to Centre

MALAVIKA PRASAD NEW DELHI, NOVEMBER 16

THE DELHI High Court Thursday granted one last opportunity to the Centre to frame policy for the online sale of drugs within eight weeks after observing that it had five years to do the same.

The high court was hearing a batch of pleas, including a 2018 PIL moved by one Dr Zaheer Ahmed seeking a ban on "illegal" sale of drugs and medicines online. The PIL further claims that the sale of drugs through e-pharmacies increases the risk of self-medication. the sale of drugs without a prescription, as well as the sale of psychotropic substances.

A division bench of Acting Chief Justice Manmohan and Justice Mini Pushkarna noted the submission of the Centre's counsel who said that "deliberations are still ongoing with respect to a draft notification of August 28, 2018, relating to online sale of

drugs". The bench, thereafter, said. "This court is of the view that more than five years have lapsed and the Union of India has had sufficient time to frame a policy."

However, in the interest of justice, the court granted "one last opportunity" to the Centre to frame a policy "within eight weeks". The high court further said if the policy is not framed within the given time, the joint secretary dealing with the subject should be personally present in court on the next hearing date. The batch is next listed on March 4, 2024.

In December 2018, the high court passed an order staying the online sale of medicines by epharmacies since the same was not permitted under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and the Pharmacy Act, 1948.

In the same batch, another plea filed by South Chemists and Distributors Association seeks the closure of online pharmacy companies offering drugs and prescription medicines through websites. The plea contends that the sale of drugs and prescription medicines online is illegal and without any mandate of law.

Sale and purchase of drugs are regulated by various legislative enactments and rules, such as the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940; Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945; Pharmacy Act. 1948: Pharmacy Practice Regulations, 2015; Indian Medical Act, 1956; Code of Ethics Regulations, 2002; and Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisement) Act. 1954.

However, "The online pharmacies are not following any of the provisions and are allowed to operate freely," the petition states. The plea contends that the same was in violation of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India as it resulted in the denial of a level playing field between the online and the offline pharmacies.
