## THE RIGHT TO TREATMENT

Accurate tools for detecting TB, medication, must be made widely available

DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS (DR-TB) is a huge challenge that demands our urgent attention. With a quarter of the world's DR-TB cases, India's response can shape how other countries deal with this growing threat. The WHO estimates that 119,000 new cases of multidrug/rifampicin resistant TB(MDR/RR-TB) emerge in India each year. However, the Indian TB programme has notified only a lit tle over half the estimate - 64,000 MDR/RR-- in 2022. Our inability to diagnose DR-TB rapidly is a huge gap. Although several drug regimens are available for DR-TB, these are long, tedious, and have severe side effects.

Thankfully, there is new hope for people with DR-TB. Huge improvements have been made in diagnosis. We can now rapidly detect TB as well as drug-resistance using rapid molecular diagnostics. These tests were extensively used for Covid-19 during the pandemic.

Recently the WHO released a Standard on Universal Access to Rapid TB Diagnostics, recommending the use of molecular diagnostics as the initial test as these are highly accurate, detect resistance to drugs, are cost-effective, and reduce treatment-related delay. However, last year in India, only about 23 per cent of those presumed with TB underwent these initial diagnostics tests - the traditional sputum smear microscopy was the initial diagnostic investigation for 77 per cent of the suspected

Last year in India, only about 23 per cent of those presumed with TB underwent these initial diagnostics tests - the traditional sputum smear microscopy was the initial diagnostic investigation for 77 per cent of the suspected patients. Microscopy, a century-old tool, cannot detect drug-resistance, and detects only half of all people with these tests.

patients. Microscopy, a century-old tool, cannot detect drug-resistance, and detects only half of all people with these tests.

Several Indian companies make such molecular tests. India has also invested heavily in molecular platforms during Covid-19, and these must be repurposed to fight TB. During Covid-19, many Indian companies also manufactured lower-cost reagents and supplies to make PCR more affordable.

Shortening the duration of DR-TB treatment from 24 months to 6 months is a big improvement. We can now treat the more serious form of the disease with just oral medications and avoid painful injections.

In December 2022, WHO recommended the use of the BPaLM/BPaL regimen for DR-TB patients, which offers a s much higher success rate of 89 per cent, reduces the pill burden to only three to four pills a day and shortens the treatment duration. Studies estimate an annual saving of \$740 million globally because of transition to BPaLM/BPaL. ith India accounting for a third of the global MDR/RR-TB treated patients this could mean a saving of nearly \$250 million per year for the country.

However, India continues to use a mix of treatment options, most of which are difficult to adhere to. As per the India TB Report 2023 wer 22,000 Indian MDR/RR-TB patients in

2021 were on treatment regimens which con tained injectables - the WHO has recommended phasing out injectables in 2019. Only 68 per cent of the MDR/RR-TB patients initiated on treatment in 2020 successfully completed treatment. Moreover, in 2022, only 53 per cent MDR/RR-TB patients (~31,000) were put on the shorter bedaquiline-containing regimen, the preferred drug for DR-TB, recommended by the WHO since 2019.

Most notably, India is the only global sup olier of pretomanid, a key drug within the BPaL regimen. However, only 403 patients in India have so far been administered the pretomanid-containing BPaL regimen through a clinical trial.

As a physician, researcher and a TB cure advocate. I firmly believe that every individual has the right to access diagnostic and treatment options that offer them the best chances of recovery. Thankfully, we now have highly accurate tools to detect DR-TB, and we can cure DR-TB within six-months with oral medications. In 2023, these new tools must be eas ily and widely available to all people with DR-TB in India. No one should suffer or die from drug-resistant TB.
