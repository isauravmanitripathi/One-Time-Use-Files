## After Apple inclusion of NavIC, govt considers making homegrown navigation tech mandatory

## SOUMYARENDRA BARIK NEW DELHI, SEPTEMBER 14

AFTER CONVINCING Apple to support navigation technology NavIC in some new iPhone 15 models, the Union government may mandate manufacturers to embed the homegrown GPS alternative in all smartphones sold in India by 2025.

All 5G phones would be required to support NavIC - or Navigation with Indian Constellation - by January 1, 2025, and other phones by December 2025, Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar told The Indian Express Thursday.

To increase the adoption of the homegrown navigation system, the government is also considering offering additional incentives to smartphone makers in the next round of its production-linked in-

CURRENTLY, ONLY a few smartphone makers support India's homegrown navigation alternative to GPS, which, the government says, can offer better resolution output for places in the country and adjoining areas. Apple's adoption of NavIC could help with its mainstream adoption. Now, the government wants to encourage sourcing of NavIC-supporting chips that are made or designed in India under the PLI scheme.

centive (PLI) scheme if they use chips designed or manufactured in India which support NaviC technology, he said.

EXPLAINED

"In line with the incentives that we have announced under the IT hardware PLI, where cashback to companies can significantly go up if they use India-designed or -manufactured chips in their systems, we will extend the same idea to the smartphone

PLI as well for using domestic chips that support NavIC, Chandrasekhar said.

"Increasingly we will make it mandatory as it is already in the automobile segment, we will make it almost mandatory that all the devices that use GPS use the NavIC chipsets," he said. He clarified that the requirement will only be to include NavIC and not exclude other GPS systems.

Currently, only a handful of smartphones - from manufacturers such as Poco, Vivo and Xiaomi - support NavlC.

Developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation. NavIC was approved in 2006 at a cost of \$174 million but became operational only by 2018. It is India's attempt at building an independent standalone navigation satellite system, something rival China has already done.

Earlier this week, as Apple announced its latest iPhone lineup, it said the two 'pro' model phones will support NavlC. This is the first time Apple has added support for NavIC to any of its iPhone models.

"But the chip that Apple is using for navigation and positioning is being designed by Qualcomm, and we want to create an incentive structure that will encourage companies under the PLI schemes to use NavIC-

supporting chips designed or made in India," Chandrasekhar said, adding that incentives similar to those under the IT hardware PLI could be offered to smartphone makers.

Under the IT hardware PLI scheme, companies that manufacture laptops, computers and servers and source locally made components will also get additional incentives under the restructured scheme.

The measure under consideration could also extend beyond incentives, with the government mandating that smartphones manufactured in India must support NaviC technology.

It is learnt that Apple's support for NavIC came after months of discussions between the government and manufacturers. Companies were learnt to have pushed back initially, citing high research costs for integrating the technology.
