# 100,000 GALAXIES IN A SINGLE FRAME: THE PROMISE OF EUCLID

#### EXPRESS NEWS SERVICE NEW DELHI, NOVEMBER 9

THE EUROPEAN Space Agency Tuesday shared the first five images from its Euclid telescope, launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida in July.

Although the stunning celestial landscapes Euclid captured have been observed previously, most notably by NASA's iconic Hubble Space Telescope, Euclid's snapshots are at another level.

"I'm just overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the data," Michael Seiffert, a member of the Euclid mission told The NYT. "The ability to have really sharp images cover a wide field at the same time is just really astounding."

## Comparing Euclid and JWST

In recent years, the James Webb Space Telescope, jointly operated by NASA, ESA and the Canadian Space Agency, has captured imaginations across the world with its ethereal space pictures. While it has a very different mission, the Euclid hopes to do the same.

Whereas the JWST zooms in on one part of the sky at a time, Euclid excels at imaging wide, but still detailed, swathes of the universe. That's perfect for "when

you want to look for a needle in a haystack." Seiffert said, including objects like free-floating worlds.

### Universe's 'dark' secrets

Euclid is on a quest to map a third of the extragalactic sky. Scientists hope that with data Euclid sends home, researchers can learn about how the web of dark matter cementing our universe together influences the shapes and motions of visible objects in space. The telescope's detailed resolution is also expected to help scientists map the distribution of galaxies across cosmic time, aiding in understanding dark energy, the inexplicable force pulling the universe apart.

So far, the images have not disappointed. The images spanned four areas of the relatively nearby universe, including 1,000 galaxies belonging to the massive Perseus cluster just 240 million light years away, and more than 100,000 galaxies spread out in the background, ESA said. Scientists believe vast, seemingly organised structures such as Perseus could only have formed if dark matter existed.

In 2025, scientists plan to release Euclid's first maps of the universe, which will include more sky area than in all of the data collected so far by the Hubble Space Telescope, Seiffert said.
