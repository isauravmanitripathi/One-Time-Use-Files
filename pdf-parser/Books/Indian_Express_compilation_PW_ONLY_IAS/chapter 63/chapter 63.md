THE RESERVE Bank of India (RBI) has decided to stop the rampant elongation of the<br>tenor of floating rate loans and resetting of the tenor by banks without in<br>rowers. The RBI announced

on Thursday that it will bring<br>a framework of transparency<br>and proper rules while reset-<br>ting equated monthly instal-<br>ments-(EMI-) based floating rate loans.

## Why the decision?

VMy the occision?<br>Supervisory reviews by the central bank,<br>andfeedback and references from the pub-<br>lic have revealed several instances of unrea-<br>sonable elongation of tenor of floating rate<br>loans by lenders without pro

nication and consent from borrowers.<br>Banks can change the interest rate by<br>changing the internal benchmark rate and<br>the spread during the term of the loan – The Spiead during the term of the loan –<br>potentially harming borrowers' interests<br>and impairing monetary transmission.<br>Borrowershave complained that banks<br>change or reset EMIs arbitrarily, and extend<br>tenors without info

charges. The RBI has also observed that unduly long elongation of tenors has camou-<br>flaged stress in banks. The borrower can in

theory refinance the floating rate loan by <br>going to another bank, but this does not <br>work well in practice. Floating rate loans of <br>different banks with internal benchmarks are not identical even i

The borrower in such a situation is often left with no choice but to remain captive to the original bank, and pay higher<br>charges on existing loans.

So what has the RBI planned?

A proper conduct framework will have to

It also means that they have a reduced opportunity to benefit from appreciation if they sell the property, because less principal has been paid<br>back, Anarock Research said in a report.
