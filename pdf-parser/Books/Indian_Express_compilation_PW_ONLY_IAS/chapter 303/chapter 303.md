THE GOVERNMENT may unveil a new version of the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) for the next five years, with financial assistance 85 per cent higher than under the current scheme for each beneficiary, to build pucca houses in rural areas.

Currently, under the PMAY-G, the beneficiaries are provided financial assistance of Rs 1.2 lakh in plains and Rs 1.3 lakh in hilly states - Northeastern states and union territories (UTs) of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh - as well as difficult areas and Integrated Action Plan (IAP) districts. Under the revamped scheme, the cash support will likely be enhanced to an average of Rs 2.39 lakh/housing unit, according to official sources.

The current version of PMAY-G will run only till the end of the current fiscal.

On November 29, 2023, the Union Cabinet approved Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JAN-MAN), under which Rs 2.39 lakh/unit is given for the provision of pucca houses to improve socio-economic conditions of the particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs).

"Keeping in mind the escalation in cost, a similar cash support will likely be given in the new version of PMAY-G. Construction of new housing units over an extended period will also boost the rural economy," an official told FE. The cash support could be similar to what

is being offered under PM JAN-MAN, the official added.

An announcement could be expected in interim Budget 2024-25 to be presented in Parliament on February 1.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that uplifting the poor, youth, women and farmers are his priority areas to make the country a developed nation.

With the PMAY-Urban scheme also ending in March this year, the Centre will likely launch a revamped urban affordable housing keeping in mind escalation in costs. the Accordingly, it may unveil a new â‚¹60,000 crore interest subsidy scheme for the urban poor and middle class for five years. It will offer interest subvention of 3-6 per cent per annum on home loan amounts up to Rs 50,00,000. The extant scheme offered interest subvention for home loans up to Rs 18 lakh.

To achieve the target of 'Housing for All' in rural areas, the Centre rolled out PMAY-G on April 1, 2016, to assist in constructing 29.5 million pucca houses with basic amenities. Out of the overall target, 29.46 million houses have been sanctioned to states, out of which. 25.4 million houses have been completed as of January 14, 2024.

The government may save around Rs 18,000 crore in PMAY-G in the current financial year as some states are not eligible to get funds, either for failing the eligibility conditions or not implementing the scheme.

The government has budgeted Rs 54,487 crore for PMAY-G in FY24, the highest annual allocation after the launch of the scheme in 2016.

The expected savings in PMAY-G would cover the additional allocation of Rs 16.143 crore for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in the first supplementary demand for grants, which was approved by the Lok Sabha in December, FE
