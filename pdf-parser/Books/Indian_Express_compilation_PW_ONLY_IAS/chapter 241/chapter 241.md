# After Mahua's expulsion

Now that she has been expelled from Lok Sabha, what options does Mahua Moitra have? She can go to the Supreme Court â€“ in 2005, the court held that proceedings of Parliament that may be tainted by 'gross illegality or unconstitutionality are not protected from judicial scrutiny'. This could be her argument

NEW DELHI, DECEMBER 8

TRINAMOOL CONGRESS MP Mahua Moitra was expelled from Lok Sabha on Friday after the House adopted the report of its Ethics Committee that found her guilty of indulging in "unethical conduct" and committing "serious misdemeanours", and recommended her expulsion.

The TMC has backed Moitra, and vowed to fight the issue politically. But what is the legal road ahead for the first-time MP? Moitra was no longer listed as a member on the Lok Sabha website on Friday evening, and her constituency, Krishnanagar, was "vacant".

### Can Mahua Moitra go to the Supreme Court in appeal?

'Normally, House proceedings cannot be challenged on the ground of procedural irregularity. Article 122 of the Constitution gives immunity to the proceedings from a challenge in court," former Lok Sabha secretary general PDT Achary told The Indian Express on Friday.

Article 122 says "the validity of any proreedings in Parliament shall not be called (into) question on the ground of any alleged irregularity of procedure".

It specifies that "no officer or Member of Parliament in whom powers are vested...for regulating procedure or the conduct of business, or for maintaining order, in Parliament shall be subject to the jurisdiction of any court in respect of the exercise by him of those powers

And yet, Moitra does have the option of challenging her expulsion in the apex court, Achary said.

The Supreme Court had said in the 2007 Raja Ram Pal case that "those restrictions are only for procedural irregularities. There may be other cases where judicial review may be necessary," Achary pointed out.

## What was the Raja Ram Pal case?

Raja Ram Pal, who was a BSP leader at the time, was among the  $12 \text{ MPs} - 11 \text{ from Lok}$ Sabha and one from Rajya Sabha - who were expelled for their alleged involvement in the December 2005 cash-for-query scandal.

In January 2007, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court headed by then Chief Justice of India Y K Sabharwal, dismissed petitions filed by the expelled MPs and upheld their expulsion in a  $4-1$  majority judgment.

The court described Parliament's action as a "self-protection" exercise. But it also noted that "the proceedings which may be tainted on account of substantive or gross illegality or unconstitutionality are not protected from judicial scrutiny.

The court said: "The judicature is not prevented from scrutinising the validity of the action of the legislature trespassing on the fundamental rights conferred on the citi zens... The judicial review of the manner of exercise of power of contempt or privilege does not mean the said jurisdiction is being usurped by the judicature." (Raja Ram Pal vs<br>Speaker, Lok Sabha & Ors)

The judgment also mentioned Article 105(3) of the Constitution.

#### And what is this provision of the Constitution?

Article 105 deals with the powers and privileges of Parliament and of its Members and committees. Article 105(3) says "... The pow ers, privileges and immunities of each House of Parliament, and of the Members and the committees of each House, shall be such as may, from time to time, be defined by Parliament by law, and, until so defined, shall be those of that House and of its Members and committees immediately before the coming into force of Section 15 of the Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1978."

The court said "there is no basis to claim...absolute immunity to the Parliamentary proceedings in Article 105(3) of the Constitution. The manner of enforcement of privilege by the legislature can result in judicial scrutiny, though subject to the restrictions contained in the other Constitutional provisions, for example Article

# 122 or 212."

The court, however, made it clear that the "truth or correctness of the material (relied upon by the Legislature for taking action) will not be questioned by the court nor will it go into the adequacy of the material or substitute its opinion for that of the Legislature".

#### So what can be the grounds for a possible legal challenge by Moitra?

Achary said that while a House has the power to expel a Member, the court can scrutinize whether a particular privilege existed at that time or not. "If it is a breach of privilege, then the House has the power to expel a Member. But the court can see whether that privilege existed at that time," he said.

Achary also pointed out that the functions of the Privileges Committee and the Ethics Committee are different from that of other parliamentary committees, and the procedures that apply to the latter may not necessarily apply to the former.

"The Privileges Committee and Ethics Committee investigate or look into the misconduct of a Member, see whether that person has brought down the dignity of the House or behaved in a manner which is unbecoming of a Member... Therefore, a proper procedure has to be laid down. You cannot follow the same procedures and methods followed by other committees which study subjects and Bills," he said.

According to Achary, "Although there are

no specific rules laid down for investigative work, it is understood that the committee will allow the person to depose before it, and call the other people concerned and hear them. In some cases, the accused MP has the right to cross-examine those people... You have to use all fair methods to find the truth. The question is whether all those have been followed or not."

Moitra has claimed that she was denied natural justice as she was not allowed to cross-examine real estate developer Darshan Hiranandani, who allegedly bribed her, and her former partner Jai Anant Dehadrai, who made the allegations against her.

Achary made the point that under Article 20, "No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of the law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence".

Therefore, he argued, "There should be a law; it includes Rules. If there is a Rule that characterises that particular act as an offence, and if a Member has violated that...only then can that person be punished. One of the main charges against Moitra is that she shared the Parliament login-password with another person. But Lok Sabha Rules don't say it is a violation... They are silent."

However, Achary added, "Accepting money from a businessman (allegedly) for asking questions was a breach of privilege and should have been inquired into by the Privileges Committee."
