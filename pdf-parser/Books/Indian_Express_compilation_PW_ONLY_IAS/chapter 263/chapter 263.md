## FROM PAGE ONE Aditya Ll set to be placed in final orbit

"This manoeuvre is critical. It involves the firing of thrusters in order to change the speed and trajectory of the spacecraft. If the intended orbit is missed in the first attempt, there would be multiple subsequent corrections and thruster firings required," said Dibyendu Nandi, solar physicist and Chair, Space Weather and Monitoring Committee, Aditya L1 mission.

As on Wednesday, Aditya had successfully completed 124 days in space. Since September 18, just 16 days into its journey, Aditya had started collecting scientific data and imaging the Sun. The scientists have, so far, obtained the first sneak peek into high-energy Xray of solar flares, full solar disc images and others.

Aditya has seven scientific payloads of which the Visible Emission Line Coronograph (VELC), Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT), Solar Low Energy X-ray Spectrometer (SoLEXS), High-Energy L1 Orbiting X-ray Spectrometer (HEL1OS) are designed to directly track the Sun. There are other insitu (on site) measuring instruments like the Aditya Solar Wind Particle Experiment (ASPEX), Plasma Analyser Package for Aditya (PAPA), and Advanced Triaxial High Resolution Digital Magnetometers.

Four instruments, including PAPA and one component, the Solar Wind Ion Spectrometer, of ASPEX, were switched on during the spacecraft's cruising phase and are reportedly functioning well. Aditya will be inserted into a halo orbit around L1, from where the satellite will have full access to solar storms, radiations and other emissions emerging from the Sun even before they are directed towards Earth or come under the in-

fluence of the Earth's magnetic field. SUIT, seated on the top deck of the Aditya-L1, will be among the first to get operational once the spacecraft reaches L1.

The mission is being keenly watched across the world as its seven payloads offer a comprehensive study of the solar phenomena. The instruments can study the sun at multiple wavelengths, they can study the radiation, particles, and magnetic fields released by the Sun, and see these phenomena in different directions.

The spacecraft also has a coronagraph that will allow scientists to look much closer to the surface of the Sun and complement the data from NASA and European Space Agency's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission -- the only other satellite currently located in L1 position.

"To study the faint light com-

ing from the corona, we need to artificially block the bright light from the photosphere or the surface of the Sun. The catch in doing that is we may not be able to block only the photosphere -- the size of the occulting disk is usually bigger than the photosphere. If we assume the size of the photosphere to be 1 unit, the occulting disk has been of 2 units for previous missions. For the first time, with the Aditya L1 mission, we are trying to see as close as possible to the beginning of the corona with a smaller occulting disk that is just 1.05 times the photosphere," Prof RRamesh from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics had told The Indian Express recently. The coronagraph on SOHO that was lost had an occulting disc that was 1.1 times the radius of the Sun surface.
