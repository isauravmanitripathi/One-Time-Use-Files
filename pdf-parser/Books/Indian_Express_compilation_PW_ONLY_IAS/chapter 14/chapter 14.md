## Odisha's big cat numbers falling: 45 tigers counted in 2006, only 20 remain now; one reserve left with none

## SUJIT BISOYI BHUBANESWAR, JULY 29

THE TIGER census figures released Saturday have triggered an alarm in Odisha - more than half the tigers the state had in 2006 have vanished, with one tiger reserve left with none at all.

While experts believe rampant poaching is a main contributor to the sharp decline in the numbers, some officials have raised questions on the methodology of counting the tigers.

Convinced there are more tigers than reported in the census, the state will be conducting its own survey later this year.

The All India Tiger Estimation -2022 was released by Union MoS for Forest, Environment and

Experts say poaching is to blame for the decline in numbers

It shows that the number of tigers in India has increased from 2,967 in 2018 to 3,682 in 2022 an annual rise of 6%. Madhya Pradesh has the most number (785) of tigers, followed by Karnataka (563)

Bucking the trend, Odisha has 20 tigers, down from 28 in 2018, and a 55% fall since 2006. when the state had 45 tigers.

What's added to the alarm now is that there are no tigers left in the Satkosia Tiger Reserve, which had just one tiger in 2018. Though, at the only other reserve, Similipal Tiger Reserve, the number has doubled from 8 in 2018 to 16 in 2022.

While not discounting natural deaths, many wildlife experts blame rampant poaching for the worrying decline in tiger numbers. Recently, two forest guards were shot dead by poachers inside Similipal, triggering fears of poachers resorting to a more aggressive approach of late.

In 2008, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik had announced the setting up of a Special Striking Force (SSF), but it remains on paper.

Others believe there's a need to increase the tigers' prey base to ensure their sustainability.

Though Odisha has habitats for tigers, there is a need to increase the prey base to sustain the tiger population. Officials should ensure the population of chital, sambhar and deer is increased to sustain tiger population," said Anup Nayak, former additional director general (project tiger) of the NTCA

However, forest officials have raised questions on the NTCA's methodology, use of camera traps and the prey-based method, since 2006.

Said SK Popli, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife): "As ordered by the CM in May, we will be carrying out the estimation ourselves in the state from October. This will provide the updated status of tigers."
