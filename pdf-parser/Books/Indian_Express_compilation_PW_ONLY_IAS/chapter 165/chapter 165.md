NEW DELHI, NOVEMBER 5

IN THE MIDST of the election season, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced an extension of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan EXPLAINED Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) free ration scheme for another five years, while addressing rallies in Madhya Pradesh & Chhattisgarh.

"Under the PMGKAY, free ration has been provided to the poor in the country for the past three years. Even though the onemonth free ration scheme is coming to an end, Modi's commitment is to extend it for the next five years. For the next five years, the stoves of 80 crore people in my country will keep burning. This is Modi's guarantee," he said.

The PMGKAY was introduced in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic to provide 5 kg free foodgrains to eligible ration card holders under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA). The NFSA, introduced by the UPA government at the time, entitled beneficiaries to receive subsidised foodgrains (at Rs 3, Rs 2 and Rs 1 per kg of rice, wheat and coarse grains) through the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS).

In late 2022, ahead of the Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh Assembly polls, the PMGKAY was extended until December 2022 and then for another year until December 2023, merging it with

the NFSA. With the scheme nearing its expiry, the government has again extended it, this time for another five years.

### Scope of PMGKAY

The NFSA covers about 20 crore families.

or a total 81.35 crore beneficiaries, who account for two-thirds of the population  $-$  50% for urban and 75% for rural.

While the AAY households are entitled to 35 kg of foodgrains per month irrespective of the number of family members, the priority households get foodgrains depending on the number of family members (each member 5 kg per month). The PMGKAY's free ration was in addition to this.

## Allocations under PMGKAY

Since the scheme was introduced in 2020, the government has allocated 1,118 lakh metric tonnes of foodgrains from its central procurement pool at a cost of Rs 3.9 lakh crore.

In January this year, the PMGKAY was merged with the NFSA, providing all ration for AAY and PHH families for free and eliminating the additional provisions introduced during the pandemic.
