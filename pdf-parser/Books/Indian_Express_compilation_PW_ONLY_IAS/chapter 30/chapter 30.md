## Environment Govt unveils green hydrogen standards, sets emission thresholds for production

## MANISH GUPTA NEW DELHI, AUGUST 19

THE MINISTRY of New and Renewable Energy on Saturday notified the green hydrogen standard for India, outlining the emission thresholds for production of hydrogen that can be classified as 'green'. India became one of the few countries to have a definition for green hydrogen.

"After discussions with multiple stakeholders, the ministry has decided to define green hydrogen as having a well-to-gate emission of not more than two kg carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent per kg hydrogen (H2)," the ministry said in a statement.

The well-to-gate emission includes water treatment, electrolysis, gas purification, drying and compression of hydrogen. The scope of the definition encompasses both electrolysisbased and biomass-based hydrogen production methods.

The notification specifies that a detailed methodology for measurement, reporting, monitoring, on-site verification and certification of green hydrogen and its derivatives will be specified by the ministry of new and renewable energy.

The notification also specifies that the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) under the ministry of power will be the nodal authority for accreditation of agencies for the monitoring, verification and certification for green hydrogen production

projects.

The government launched National Green Hydrogen Mission early this year with an aim to produce 5 million metric tonne (MMT) green hydrogen per annum with an associated renewable energy capacity of about 125 giga watt (GW) by 2030.

The mission has an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore up to 2029-30. The Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) programme is a major financial measure under the mission with an outlay of Rs 17,490 crore.

The programme proposes two distinct financial incentive mechanisms to support domestic production of electrolysers and production of green hydrogen. These incentives are aimed at enabling rapid scaleup, technology development and cost reduction.

The definition of green hydrogen brings a lot of clarity to the mission of making India a global green hydrogen hub. FE
