What has been the record of inflation<br>over the past 10 years?<br>If the annual inflation rate is 4% – the RBI's<br>mandate – it implies that the general price<br>level will rise by 4% every year. As such, in five<br>years, the general The way this calculation works is to peg<br>the general price level at the 100 mark. A4% increase in overall prices each year implies that<br>whatever you could buy for Rs 100 in the base year costs Rs 104 in first year, Rs 108 in the sec-<br>ond (Rs 108 and paise 16 to be exact), and so<br>on, until it costs roughly Rs 122 in the fifth year.

**What is the upshot of these calculations?**<br>By itself, inflation data provide only one side<br>of the affordability story. To assess whether a person is better/ worse off, one has to look at<br>the trends of *both* income and inflation.

To understand whether people are better<br>or worse off, and by how much, from where<br>they were five or 10 years ago, the following<br>rough calculation is helpful:<br>
