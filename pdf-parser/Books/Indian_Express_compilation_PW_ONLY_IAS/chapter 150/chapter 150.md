# Why Egypt is keeping Gaza's Rafah border crossing shut

THE RAFAH crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt is the sole route for aid to enter Gaza directly from outside Israel, and the only exit that does not lead to Israeli territory. It has become a focus in the intensifying conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have headed towards south Gaza after Israel warned them to leave Gaza City and the enclave's north.

#### Where is the crossing?

The crossing is at the south of the Gaza Strip, a narrow slither of land home to 2.3 million people and wedged between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.

The crossing is controlled by Egypt.

## Why is access across Rafah restricted?

Egypt is wary of insecurity near the border with Gaza in northeastern Sinai, where it faced an Islamist insurgency that peaked after 2013 and has now largely been suppressed.

Since Hamas took control in Gaza in 2007, Egypt has helped enforce a blockade of the enclave and heavily restricted the flow of people and goods. Like the main crossings with Israel, restrictions have sometimes been eased but not lifted, and travellers need security clearance and lengthy checks to pass.

In 2008, tens of thousands of Palestinians crossed into Sinai after Hamas blasted holes in border fortifications. prompting Egypt to build a stone and cement wall.

Egypt has acted as a mediator between

Israel and Palestinian factions during past conflicts and periods of unrest. But in those situations it has also locked down the border, allowing aid to enter and medical evacuees to leave but preventing any large-scale movement of people.

## What efforts are being made to open the border?

The United Nations has urged Israel to avert a "humanitarian catastrophe" in Gaza, warning that food, fuel and even drinking water supplies are running dangerously low.

Hospitals say they are struggling to cope with the wounded as back-up generators run low on fuel. Egyptian aid trucks moved closer to the crossing on Tuesday but it was unclear when or whether they would be able to cross into Gaza.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday the United States and Israel had agreed to develop a plan to get humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza without benefiting Hamas.
