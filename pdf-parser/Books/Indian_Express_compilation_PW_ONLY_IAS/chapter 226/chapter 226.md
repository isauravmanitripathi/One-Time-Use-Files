## POPULATION DENSITY OF FISH-LIKE SALAMANDER DOWN BY 99.5% IN LESS THAN TWO DECADES In Mexico, ecologists going all out to save iconic 'water monster'

## DANIEL SHAILER MEXICO CITY, NOVEMBER 27

COLOGISTS FROM Mexico's National Autonomous university<br>on Friday relaunched a fundrais-<br>ing campaign to bolster conservation efforts for axolotis, an<br>iconic, endangered fish-like type<br>of salamander.

The campaign, called<br>"Adoptaxoloti," asks people for<br>as little as 600 pesos(about \$35)<br>to virtually adopt one of the tiny<br>water monsters." Virtual adop-<br>tion comes with live updates on<br>your axoloti's health.<br>For less, d

of the creatures a virtual dinner. In their main habitat the pop-

ulation density of Mexican axolotis (ah-ho-LOH'-tulz) has<br>plummeted 99.5% in under two decades, according to scientists<br>behind the fundraiser.

Last year's Adoptaxoloti campaign raised just over 450,000<br>pesos (\$26,300) towards an experimental captive breeding<br>program and efforts to restore habitat in the ancient Aztec<br>canals of Xochimilco, a southern horough of Mexico City

Still, there are not enough resources for thorough research, said Alejandro Calzada,<br>an ecologist surveying less wellknown species of axolotis for<br>the government's environment
