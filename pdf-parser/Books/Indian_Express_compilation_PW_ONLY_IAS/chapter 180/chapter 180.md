## Police horse dies of 'trauma' after Eden Gardens fireworks

## EXPRESS NEWS SERVICE KOLKATA, NOVEMBER 7

WHEN SPECTATORS cheered roaringly to mark India's victory over South Africa in the ongoing Men's Cricket World Cup at the famous Eden Gardens on Sunday night, little did they, and the match organisers, know what lay in store for the horses of the Kolkata Police's mounted division deployed just outside the stadium for crowd management. As soon as a massive fireworks display started around 8:30pm in the stadium, Voice of Reason, as it was named, and other horses of the Mounted Police went into distress and started running around the place with their handlers left clueless.

Voice of Reason, a mare aged 5 years, succumbed late in the night due to "trauma", said a senior police official, citing postmortem examination of the animal. The firecrackers display went on for nearly 10 minutes.
