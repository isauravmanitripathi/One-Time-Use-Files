## CENTRE'S AGRO PROCESSING CLUSTERS SCHEME Only two out of 70 projects operational, at least 30 running behind stipulated schedule

## AGGAM WALIA NEW DELHI. SEPTEMBER 24

JUST TWO out of 70 projects approved under the Ministry of Food Processing Industries' Agro Processing Clusters (APC) scheme are complete and operational as per latest government figures accessed by The Indian Express. The APC scheme was in the news earlier this month when a political controversy erupted over the scheme allegedly benefiting Pride East Entertainments, a company related to Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma's wife.

A total of 17 projects have completed building the core processing and basic enabling infrastructure but do not yet meet the requirement of operationalising at least 5 food processing units in the cluster. Of the remaining 51 projects under implementation, 30 are running behind the stipulated time schedule. Incidentally, the APC scheme is a modified version of the ministry's Mega Food Parks (MFP) scheme, which was discontinued in 2021 as it "could not achieve" its desired outcomes. According to the ministry, delays

in projects in the revamped APC scheme include time-consuming processes like change of land use, clearances from pollution control boards, sanction of term loan by lending bank/financial institutions, and Covid related delays.

As per an earlier report in The Indian Express, the agricultural land acquired last year by Pride East Entertainments for the purpose of setting up an agro processing cluster is lying fallow. The company, in which Assam CM's wife Riniki Sarma is a director, was granted approval under the APC scheme in November last year for a grant of Rs 10 crore.

On Friday, Sarma filed a defamation suit against Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi for alleging that her company received a subsidy of Rs 10 crore from the central government under the APC scheme.

A subcomponent of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sampada Yojana scheme, beneficiaries under the APC scheme are given up to Rs 10 crore in three phases of grants to set up an agro processing cluster for at least 5 food processing units with a minimum investment of Rs 25 crore. Beneficiaries are required to either own 10 acres of land or lease an equivalent size for at least 50

years. The cost of land is not eligible for inclusion in the total project cost. The Ministry of Food Processing Industries proposed a total outlay of Rs 584 crore for the scheme during the 15th Finance Commission cycle including committed liability for ongoing projects. Since 2019-20, a total of Rs 193 crore have been released by the ministry as grants-in-aid for the approved projects. For the same period, a total of Rs 297 crore have been approved for the scheme.

Through an agro processing cluster, the scheme intends to facilitate the setting up of basic infrastructure including roads and drainage, and common facilities for food processing units including warehouses and cold storages. The ministry approved 15 projects in 2018, followed by 13 in 2019, then 14 in 2020, 7 in 2021, and 21 in 2022. As per the ministry's Annual Report 2022-23, a total of 79 projects were approved. The number is now down to 70 projects as some of them were either withdrawn or cancelled.

As per the scheme's guidelines, projects are required to be finished within two years from the date of approval for most states, with an exception of hilly states which have a longer time frame of 2.5 years. Additionally, a six-month extension can be sought by projects, however that would lead to a reduction in the total amount of grants-in-aid approved. The scheme also has provisions for extensions due to events of force majeure, like pandemics. Extensions due to events of force majeure are exempt from reduction in the grants-inaid approved.

According to the ministry, delays in projects have been due to time-consuming processes like change of land use, Consent to Establish from pollution control boards, and sanction of term loan by lending bank/financial institutions. "Further, 2 waves of Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the implementation of projects throughout the country for around one & a half year," the ministry responded when The Indian Express reached out for comments. The APC scheme is a modified version of the ministry's Mega Food Parks (MFP) scheme which was discontinued in 2021 as it could not achieve its desired outcomes.
