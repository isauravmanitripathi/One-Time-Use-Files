## Plugging the gap: EV sales surge, start-ups launch on-demand, doorstep charging

## AGGAM WALIA

NEW DELHI, SEPTEMBER 30

WHEN DHEERAJ SINGH bought a Tata Nexon EV (electric vehicle) earlier this year, he did not install the charging kit since he planned to move out of his Noida apartment within months. Instead, he discovered Hopcharge, a Gurgaon-based start-up that provides door-to-door EV fast charging services. With a Hopcharge subscription, Singh can order a van equipped with lithium-ion power banks at an hour's notice and get his EV charged anywhere in the National Capital Region.

Noida-based Mobec, which launched its door-to-door charging service to beta users two months ago, is also coming up with a mobile fast-charging station for commercial parking
