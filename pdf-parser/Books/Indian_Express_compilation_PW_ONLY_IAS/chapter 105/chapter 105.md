## 63% cancer deaths of Indian women were preventable: Lancet

EXPLAINED

NEARLY 63 per cent of cancer deaths among women in India could have been prevented by reducing risk factors or screening or diagnosis and 37 per cent deaths averted with appropriate and timely treatment, according to the latest Lancet Commission report on gender and cancer treatment based on 2020 data.

Around 6.9 million cancer deaths among women in India were preventable and 4.03 million were treatable, the data shows.

The report, "Women, Power and Cancer", highlights how societal apathy towards women's health. lack of awareness and absence of quality expertise at the primary care level delayed their access to cancer prevention, detection and care.

The report highlights a case study of a 36-year-old woman from Mumbai's Nala Sopara area as representative of gender inequity in cancer care in the country. She did not know that her headaches stemmed from a developing brain cancer as her alcoholic husband never thought it merited basic consultation.

"If you die, then die. If you live, then live," he told her as she went through physical abuse. The local doctor dismissed her condition as an eye problem. Her father-in-law, a vendor, ensured that she got medical attention and diagnosis.

Many like her live with cancer, domestic violence and poverty, who cannot access treatment and quickly degenerate into advanced stages.

WITH SIMILAR cancer burden in both men and women, the Lancet report calls for more sex- and gender-inclusive policies and guidelines. The report raises a red flag about longstanding discriminatory practices that undermine women's interaction with the health system, leading to poorer outcomes for them. It also emphasises that women are less likely to be in a position of power and may be unable to determine their care. Additionally, it stresses that patriarchy dominates cancer care, research, and policy making.

out that in 2020, more than half of women in India diagnosed with cancer died because of family apathy, their own indifference to their condition, lack of access to medical facilities and finance.

Emphasising the need for a "feminist" approach to cancer, she told The Indian Express, "We need cancer to be seen as a priority issue in women's health. Women interact with cancer in various ways, not only as people living with the disease but also as unpaid caregivers, individuals participating in cancer prevention and screening at the national level, healthcare providers, researchers and policy makers."

"In this context, they face gender bias and discrimination on multiple fronts, be it due to their age, ethnicity, socio-economic status, gender identity or sexual orientation. This hinders their ability to seek good quality care for both diagnosis and treatment," she said.

In terms of cancer deaths among women, the top three cancers in India - breast, cervical, ovarian - were the leading causes in 2020, according to official data.

Infection continues to be the biggest risk factor for cancer in Indian women, contributing to 23 per cent of deaths, the Lancet report states. Infections that increase the risk of cancers include the HPV virus, which causes cervical cancer, and Hepatitis B and Cinfections that increase the risk of liver cancer. Tobacco is the second important risk factor, contributing to six per cent of the cancer deaths, the report says. Alcohol and obesity each contributed to one per cent of cancer mortality in India.

The report also looks at the economic impact of premature deaths because of cancer. It says that BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) nations lost out on USD 46.3 billion because of productivity loss as a result of premature cancer deaths. The report estimates that the value of unpaid cancer care-giving by women is about 3.66 per cent of India's national health expenditure.

Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi, Deputy Director, Centre for Cancer Epidemiology, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, said: "Awareness is important among women who are educationally and financially less empowered. This lot of women inevitably present themselves in advanced stages of cancer."

Which is why the Lancet Commission has called for a new feminist and inclusive agenda for cancer care.
