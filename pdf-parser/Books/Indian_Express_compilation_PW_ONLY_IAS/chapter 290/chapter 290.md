# After a challenging year for Indian start-ups, does 2024 promise a breakthrough?

SOUMYARENDRA BARIK NEW DELHI, JANUARY 10

IF 2021 was the story of India's start-up ecosystem coming into its own and establishing the country as a credible hub for building successful businesses, 2023 was a lot more sobering.

And 2024 could see founders focus more on essential metrics such as increased profitability and reduced cash burn, but investors believe that the funding ecosystem may not come anywhere close to the traction of 2021

Last year, Indian start-ups raised a total of  $$8.3$  billion – the lowest amount they have raised since 2016 when the number of such firms were also considerably fewer, according to a report. In 2022, the country had added 23 unicorns, which are private businesses with a valuation of over \$1 billion. In 2023, only two firms could attain that status.

Over 20,000 people working at various start-ups were handed pink slips too. At the same time, a number of firms cropped up hoping to ride the ongoing generative artificial intelligence (AI) wave - another trend that could see increased traction in 2024 as AI becomes more mainstream.

### How was 2023 for Indian start-ups?

Apart from registering a record low in fundraising sentiment in over half a decade, Indian start-ups also saw a decline of 72 per cent in the CAGR of funding in the last three years – signalling that the venture capital-fueled boom that followed the pandemic has now come to a halt. According to another report by Nasscom and Zinnov, tech startup founders reaffirmed the challenging market environment cash flow issues, funding availability and low customer demand were cited as top challenges in 2023.

#### India vs the world

India continued to be fourth on the list of countries where businesses raised money. The United States tops that list, with  $start-ups from there scoring 113$ billion in 2023, followed by the United Kingdom (\$17. billion),

In 2023, 18 start-ups hit the bourses in India including firms like Honana Consumer Limited, the parent company of beauty and wellness brand Mamaearth. and drone manufacturer ideaForge. In both the US and China, 34 start-ups went public in 2023, as per Tracxn.

#### Older firms struggle

The biggest impact in the sharp decline in fundraising in 2023 was on late-stage investments, which according to the

EXPLAINE

Nasscom-Zinnov report plunged significantly and were only at 29 per cent of the 2022 levels. Late-stage investments' decline is primarily due to valuation cuts and in-

vestors' focus shift towards profitability. There was also a significant decline in mega-deal rounds from 42 in 2022 to 12 in 2023.

#### Investor caution goes up

As funds struggled and a number of start-ups were found cutting corners on corporate governance, investors became significantly more cautious in cutting cheques to upcoming businesses - a crucial lifeline for young start-ups who depend on initial funding to streamline their processes and device go-to-market strategies.

As per the Nasscom-Zinnov report seed-stage funding struggled in 2023 despite massive influx and announcement of several funds in 2022. In 2023, Indian start-ups raised \$700 million in seed stage funding, compared to \$1.2 billion in 2022.

### Were there some sectors where start-ups fared better?

Funding in the Indian automotive tech start-ups grew by 16 per cent in 2023, resulting in a 4.5X increase in the sector's share of total funding as compared to 2022, as per the Nasscom-Zinnov report. There was a 57 per cent increase in mega-deal value in 2023 from that in 2020, with the deals primarily involving funding raised by EV manufacturers.

unicoms. Investors are betting on the growth of the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) ecosystem, which they hope will boost the growth of start-ups in the logistics space.

#### Were there any promising trends?

Though 2023 was a difficult year for tech start-ups, there were some silver linings on the horizon. Tech start-ups increased their focus on business fundamentals, with nearly 60 per cent of start-up founders reporting an increase in revenue and profitability in 2023, as per the Nasscom-Zinnov report.

Over a hundred generative AI start-ups are now active in India's start-up ecosystem, building horizontal and vertical applications.
