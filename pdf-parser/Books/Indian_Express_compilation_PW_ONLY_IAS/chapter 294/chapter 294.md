## DENIES BAIL TO MAN IN DOWRY DEATH CASE People need to be educated that chromosomes of son, not daughter-in-law, decide the gender of child: HC

## **MALAVIKA PRASAD** NEW DELHI, JANUARY 11

PEOPLE WHO victimise their daughter-in law for giving birth to a girl child need to be educated that it is their son and not their daughter-in-law whose chromosomes will decide the birth of a daughter or a son, the Delhi High Court recently said.

While hearing a dowry death case, the HC expressed its anguish at victimisation of women for giving birth to daughters after being constantly nagged for not fulfilling her husband and in-laws' "desire of preserving the family tree".

A single-judge bench of Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma, in its January 8 order, said that it is constrained to observe that such people need to be educated that "it is their son and not their daughterin-law whose chromosomes through union of a married couple will decide the birth of a daughter or a son"

The court was hearing a case of dowry death of a woman after being allegedly harassed by her

husband and in-laws for bringing insufficient dowry and giving birth to two daughters. The accused husband had moved a bail plea before the HC in the case.

The court said it is "disturbed to witness" scenarios wherein parents wish for the wellbeing...of their daughter after she leaves her paternal house and tries to settle in the matrimonial home but instead of providing her love and support, the "new bride is met with unrelenting greed and harassment" from her in-laws

It said the trauma is multiplied

when the victim of a dowry-related offence gives up her life due to constant torture, especially when the two daughters she has given birth to also become a ground to harass her as if she is solely responsible for giving birth to daughters. 'The genetic science in this regard is ignored according to which the genetic determina-<br>tion of gender of the unborn child. when the child is conceived, involves the combination of X and Y chromosomes, with females possessing two X chromosomes and males having one  $X$  and one  $Y$ 

chromosome. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, the outcome of fertilisation depends on whether an unfertilised egg fuses with a sperm carrying an  $X$  or  $Y$ chromosome, resulting in the birth of a girl or boy, respectively," the court said.

The HC dismissed the husband's bail plea, underscoring that "prima facie at this stage" woman had lost her life for giving birth to females "which should be totally unacceptable to a conscientious society" and such offences have to be considered as grave.
