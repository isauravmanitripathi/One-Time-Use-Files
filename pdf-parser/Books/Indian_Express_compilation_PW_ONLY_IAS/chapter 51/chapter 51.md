## Voice of Global South

BRICS should not spend energy on taking adversarial positions against the West. It should focus on representative economic governance

IN 2001, THE global economics research head for Goldman Sachs, Terence James O'Neill, popularly known as Jim O'Neill, authored a paper titled, 'The world needs better economic BRICs'. He predicted that the four emerging economies - Brazil, Russia, India and China - would register GDP growth that "would have important implications for global governance arrangements". For O'Neill, who went on to become Treasury Secretary in the UK Government, it was essentially a marketing ploy to direct investments into these countries

That acronym, BRIC, gained political trac tion when the foreign ministers of Brazil<br>Russia, India and China met on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in 2006. The<br>Russian President, Vladimir Putin took the lead in hosting a summit of BRIC countries at<br>Yekaterinburg in 2009. In 2010, South Africa was also invited to join the group, and the conomic idea of BRIC turned into a politica c called BRICS

Pundits dismissed it initially as an incompatible group with the least number of common denominators among members. But, as the group prepares to host its 15th annual summit on August 22-24 at Johannesburg in South Africa, their attitude has changed from dismissal to concern. The developing world, in contrast, is showing eagerness to join the group.

This indicates the growing clout of BRICS. The subservience of multilateral f nancial institutions to the Western political-economic agenda has been causing se rious unease in the developing world. which found in the BRICS bank - the New Development Bank - a viable alternative The NDB was started in 2014 with an ini tial capital investment of \$10 billion from each of the five member countries leadquartered in Shanghai, it soon started drawing the attention of several developing countries as an easy-to-access aid-giving<br>institution. Countries like Bangladesh, the AE, Uruguay and Egypt picked up smaller s in it in 2021.

The unease in the Western politico-economic ecosystem over the rise of BRICS is palpable. On August 3, Reuters flashed unsubstantiated news with the headline 'India's Modi unlikely to travel to South Africa for BRICS summit, sources say". Twenty-four hours later, the same agency carried another news item, quoting official sources, that "India PM Modi to travel to South Africa for BRICS summit".

Several news items started appearing in the Western media speculating about a Narendra Modi-Xi Jinping meeting and the possibility of an India-China stand-off disrupting the BRICS summit. "China and India are at odds over BRICS expansion", a prestigious US think tank declared, prompting the Indian foreign ministry spokesperson to clarify that there was no truth in that.

Meanwhile, in March, the International Criminal Court declared Putin a war criminal for some actions in Ukraine. South Africa

is a signatory to the ICC charter. That mandates it to arrest Putin in case he steps on its soil. Some Russian agencies suggested that any such step would be deemed an act of war. However, the Russian leadership wisely realised that it would be a public relations disaster to allow this "war criminal" debate to go on, and announced on July 19 that Putin would be attending the summit virtually.

Perturbed by these developments, the South African foreign minister Naledi Pandor publicly alleged that "someone... is trying to spoil our summit... creating all sorts of stories'

Many see the BRICS as a competitor to -7. Its share of the global GDP in PPP term stands at 31.67 per cent, while that of G-7 i at 30.31 per cent. BRICS countries today tall about an alternative payment system and a rew reserve currency.

More and more countries are showing eagerness to join BRICS, including Saud Arabia, UAE, Egypt, Algeria and Argentina The South African foreign minister said that there were at least a dozen request letters already lying on her table. This is a result of the developing world's growing aversion to the IMF's regulatory style. Aid-seeking countries sometimes face harsh regulations from the Bretton Woods institutions, which include human rights and LGBTQ+ rights is sues. Such issues are far beyond the economic mandate and also go against the cultural ethos of many recipient nations.

Some BRICS members see an opportunity to position the group as anti-West China, in particular, seems keen on using this forum to expand its influence. Angered by the West's incessant attacks. Putin wants de dollarisation to become the principal object tive of the BRICS agenda.

Countries like India, South Africa and Brazil need to do a balancing act on BRICS agenda. There is no denying the fact that global multilateral economic infrastructure calls for serious reform. With more than 30 per cent share of the global GDP, BRICS na-<br>tions don't have more than 15 per cent say in institutions like the IMF. However, in the reform versus replace battle, India must giv preference to making BRICS a catalyst for reformed multilateralism.

BRICS is being increasingly seen as the voice of the Global South. Prime Minister Modi is championing the cause of the Global South on multilateral forums. As the chair of  $G$ -20, he called upon the  $G$ -20 leaders to make the 55-country African Union a member of the group.

By inviting 49 heads of African nations to the BRICS summit, the president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa has also thrown his hat in the ring for leadership of the Globa South. India, South Africa and Brazil can take the lead in representing countries of the Global South in persuading developed nations to accept the new global reality of multipolarity and appreciate the need for building more inclusive democratic structures in the multilateral arena.

The narrative that BRICS is an adversary of G-7 is fraught with the danger of setting the stage for a new Cold War in the name of the Global South versus the Global North That should be averted. Jim O'Neill's proposition -- "What the world really needs is.... genuinely representative global economi governance" - should be the guiding spirit or the BRICS leadership.
