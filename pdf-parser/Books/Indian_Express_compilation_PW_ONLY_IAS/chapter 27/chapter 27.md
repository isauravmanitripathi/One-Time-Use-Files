While the Nipathvirus does not spread as<br>quickly as the Covid-19 virus, it is more<br>deadly. According to the World Health Organization(WHO), the overall global case<br>fatality rate – proportion of deaths among<br>those who test positive for the infection —of Nipahis estimated at 40% to 75%

What is the Nipah infection? se, which means itis transmitted to humans from infected an-<br>imals or contaminated food, it can also be<br>transmitted directly from person to person.<br>Its symptoms include fever, headache,<br>breathing difficulties, cough and sore throat,<br>diarr

## **How is Nipah transmitted?**

The first outbreaks of the Nipah virus amone humans was reported from Malaysia (1998) and Singapore (1999). The virus takes<br>its name from the village in Malaysia where<br>the person in whom the virus was first iso-<br>lated died of the disease. The annual host reservoir for this virus is<br>known to be the fruit bat, commonly known<br>as flying fox. Fruit bats are known to trans-<br>mitthis virus to other animals like pigs, dogs,<br>cats, goats, horses and sheep.<br>Nipah can s

Nipah can spread to hu-<br>mans after close contact with **HE/**<br>containing the virus on fruit<br>trees, fruits, date palm sap, juice or toddy.<br>Human-to-human transmission is possible

through close contact."The infection is also known to spread

through droplets in an enclosed, crowded<br>environment. That is what happened in the<br>2018 Kerala outbreak. The infection spread<br>from the index patient to others within a

small corridor for radiological tests in the<br>hospital. It cannot spread in open, well-ven-<br>tilated spaces, "said Dr E Sreekumar, direc-<br>tor of the Institute of Advanced Virology,<br>Thiruwananthapuran

EXPLAINED Since it was first identified LTH Since it was first identified<br>in 1998-99, there have been<br>multiple outbreaks of the<br>Nipah virus, all of them in<br>South and Southeast Asian nations. In HEALTH

Bangladesh, there have been at least 10 out-In India, West Bengal saw outbreaks in<br>2001 and 2007, while Kerala had reported<br>several cases in 2018, and isolated cases in<br>2019 and 2021.
The infection happens in Kerala because

the fruith the fruit bats in the region are known to carry<br>the virus. Fruit bats and pigs are what you<br>would call healthy carriers of the infection –<br>meaning they are reservoirs of the virus<br>without showing any symptoms or dying of it," said Dr Suieet Singh, former director of National Centres for Disease Control who led<br>the investigation into the 2018 outbreak.

What makes it particularly dangerous? During the first outbreak in Bengal's<br>Siliguri in 2001, 45 of the 66 people con-

firmed to have been infected died. That is a in Nadia district of West Bengal, in 2007, all<br>the five infected people died.<br>During the 2018 outbreak in Keralain 2018,

17 of the 18 patients confirmed to have been <br>infected died.<br>"It is essential to quickly start treatment of <br>those who are suspected to have Nipah. This <br>is because there is a window of just two to three days between the start of symptoms and the worsening of apatient's condition. Sending<br>samples for confirmation to NIV in Punetakes<br>some time," Dr Singh said.<br>"The suspect has to be immediately iso-

lated, while any close contacts — family mem-<br>bers, social contacts, hospital staff — should remain in quarantine till they get a negative<br>report. The important thing is to put a<br>stop to human to human transmission of the

iortality rate can be very<br>WITHENS INPUTS
