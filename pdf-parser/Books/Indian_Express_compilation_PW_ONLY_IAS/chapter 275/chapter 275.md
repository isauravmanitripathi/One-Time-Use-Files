# How AI is being harnessed in the treatment of cancer

#### RUPSA CHAKRABORTY MUMBAL JANUARY

RESEARCHERS AT Mumbai's Tata Memorial Hospital, India's largest cancer hospital, have<br>used data from 60,000 patients to establish a<br>bio-imaging bank for cancer, laying the<br>ground to build a targeted algorithm to help detect the disease at an early stage.

Dr Sudeep Gupta, director of the Tata Memorial Centre, expects the incidence of<br>cancer to double from around 13 lakh to 26 lakh cases annually over the next decade.<br>While many cancers can be cured if detected<br>and treated early, the shortage of special cases. poses a significant challenge in reducing can-<br>cer-related fatalities in India.

The goal of the bio-imaging bank is to cre-<br>ate a robust repository of radiology and <br>pathology images, linked with clinical infor-<br>mation, outcome data, treatment specifics, <br>and additional metadata. This resource is de-<br> search and diagnostics.

The project is currently focused on head The project is currently focused on head<br>and neck cancers and lung cancers with a<br>minimum 1,000 patients for each type, and<br>aims to surpass the committed patient data<br>for both cancer types upon completion of the<br>project. A base, the project creation, the project involves the testing of several AI algorithms using the the testing of several AI algorithms using the data to address medically relevant tasks such as screening for lymph node metastases, nucleus segmentation and classification, biomarker prediction  $-e.g.,$  human papilloma viru (throat) cancer, and epidermal growth factor

Comprehensive imaging generates longi-<br>tudinal patient data that helps in understanding behaviour, treatment response, disease

recurrence, and overall survival. AI and machine learning protocols utilise the data to de-<br>velop predictive models for tumour survival and guide treatment aggressiveness, Dr<br>Suyash Kulkarni, head of radiodiagnosis at

The department is also using, on a pilot<br>basis, a specific algorithm in the ICU for tho-<br>racic radiology, which immediately provides<br>a diagnosis that cross-checking by doctors has found to be 98% correct.

### What role could AI play in the treatment

What role could AI play in the treatment<br>of cancer in the future?<br>AI is expected to play a transformative<br>role in cancer treatment, especially in miti-<br>gating fatalities in rural India. AI's potential<br>lies in tailoring tre on diverse patient profiles, optimising then py outcomes.

"Through continuous<br>learning, AI enhances accuracy, ens imely cancer diagnoses, improving patient <br>utcomes, and aiding healthcare profession-
