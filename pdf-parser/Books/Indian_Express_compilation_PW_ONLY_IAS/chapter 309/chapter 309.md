The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum is being held from January 15 to 19 in Davos, Switzerland

THE WORLD Economic Forum (WEF) is holding its Annual Meeting from January 15 to 19 in Davos, Switzerland, Attendees include António Guterres, UN Secretary-General; Ajay Banga, President, World Bank Group: Tedros Adhanom Ghebrevesus, Director-General, World Health Organisation; and political leaders from India, the US, China, France and Sri Lanka, among others.

## Who initiated the World Economic Forum?

German professor Klaus Schwab founded the WEF. He was a mechanical engineering graduate who then earned a Master of Public Administration degree from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.

From 1972 to 2003, Schwab was a professor of business policy at the University of Geneva. He founded WEF in 1971, originally known as the European Management Forum.

It introduced the concept of "stakeholder capitalism." According to Schwab, "it is a form of capitalism in which companies do not only optimise short-term profits for shareholders, but seek long term value creation, by taking into account the needs of all their stakeholders. and society at large."

The WEF website says of the idea: "a company should serve all its stakeholders, not just its shareholders: employees, suppliers, and the community it is part of."

As an extension of that idea, business. government and civil society leaders have made their way to the high Alps "to consider the major global issues of the day and to brainstorm on solutions to address these challenges," it adds.

Initially, Schwab focused the meetings on how European firms could catch up with US management practices. Events in 1973, namely the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate mechanism and the Arab-Israeli War, saw the Annual Meeting expand its focus from management to economic and social issues.

Two years later, the organisation introduced a system of membership for 'the 1,000 leading companies of the world'.

Davos brings together some 3,000 paying members and selected participants – among whom are investors, business leaders, political leaders, economists, celebrities and journalists - for up to five days to discuss global issues across 500 sessions.

In the past, it has been used as a location for pivotal international diplomacy as leaders are able to break tensions in the mountain town.

The WEF also publishes rankings such as the Global Competitiveness Report and the Global Gender Gap Report.
