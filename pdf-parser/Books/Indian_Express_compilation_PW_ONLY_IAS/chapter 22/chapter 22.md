# Two House panels on women's Bill: Govt should decide quota within quota, review after 15 yrs

While the Geeta Mukherjee Committee examined the Bill that the United Front government tabled in 1996, the Jayanti Natarajan Committee assessed the Bill introduced by the UPA government in 2008

#### MANOJCG NEW DELHI, SEPTEMBER 18

WITH THE Union Cabinet on Monday approving the proposal to introduce the Women's Reservation Bill, here is a look at what two Parliamentary panels have said on the issue and its nuances. The Geeta Mukherjeeheaded Joint Committee examined the Bill tabled by the United Front government in 1996 and the Jayanti Natarajan-headed Standing Committee on Law and lustice assessed the Bill that the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government introduced in 2008.

## Additional OBC quota

Parties such as the Rashtriva Janata Dal (RJD), Janata Dal (United), and Samajwadi Party (SP) have long opposed the Bill, demanding a quota within a quota. In other words, they want the Bill to have provisions for reservation for women belonging to Other Backward Classes (OBCs). Both parliamentary panels. however, left it to the government to decide on the issue at the appropriate time.

Referring to the proposal to reserve seats for women belonging to Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), the Mukherjee committee noted that "such reservation of seats has not been provided for in the Bill for women belonging to OBCs because there is no reservation for OBCs at present under the Constitution as it exists for SCs and STs".

f

"The committee, therefore, recommends that the government may consider the issue of extending the benefit of reservation to OBCs also at the appropriate time so that the women belonging to OBCs will also get the benefit of reservation," the committee said

### Time period for quota The Mukherjee committee

said the "provisions governing the reservation of seats for women in the House of the People or the Legislative Assemblies of the states should be in the first instance for a period of 15 years from the date of commencement of the Act and may be reviewed after a period of 15 years to decide whether the reservation for women is to be continued thereafter". It suggested that the "Bill should suitably be amended" to reflect that view.

Clause 7 of the Bill introduced by the UPA government 12 years later in 2008 provided that the "reservation of seats for women

shall cease to have effect on the expiration of 15 years" from the commencement of the Act.

The Natarajan panel said, "Reservation is certainly needed to enable women to cross the sociogender hurdles and to give them a level playing ground/equal opportunities as their male counterparts. Once this 'equalisation' process is done and 'adequate' political representation of women is achieved. then the time prescribed for reservation may be reconsidered.'

## Inclusion of RS and Legislative Councils

Both the Mukherjee panel and the Natarajan committee said there should also be reservation. of seats for women in the Raiva Sabha and Legislative Councils.

"The committee recommends that the demand for extending reservation for women in Rajya Sabha and the<br>Legislative Councils needs to be examined thoroughly as the Upper Houses of Parliament and state legislatures play equally important roles under the<br>Constitution and by applying the principle of equality, women should also get their due share in

the second or upper chamber of Parliament and state legislatures," said the Natarajan panel.

# Rotation policy

The Mukherjee committee dealt with a provision in the<br>1996 Bill that said there would be no reservation for women in states and Union Territories where fewer than three seats are reserved for SCs or STs. The committee suggested a rotation policy - one seat would be reserved for women in the first term, the other seat in the second term. and both would be unreserved in the third term.

"Where there is only one seat ina state or UT, the seat in the first term shall be reserved for women. in the second and third it shall be general... By rotation of seats in this way, over a period of three terms, one-third seats for women can be ensured even in a state or UT that has only one or two seats<br>in the Lok Sabha," it said.

The Natarajan panel too dealt with a rotation policy but of a different kind. For instance, the Tamil Nadu-based Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), in its written submission before the panel, argued that women's seats should rotate once every 15 years "to enable women to contribute substantially to the development of their respective constituencies". A rotation, it said, would provide reasonable stability to the political career of a woman and improve the "horizontal spread of the influence of a woman in other constituencies as well".

The Swatantra Bharat Paksha, a Maharashtra-based party, argued that the Bill would seriously affect the servicing of the constituency by elected members of the legislature. "It will further adversely affect the quality of the legislatures in as much as the legislatures are unlikely to contain more than 33% second-termers" it said.

The Natarajan panel concluded that "rotation is in the interest of democracy and that it is the duty of the incumbent to work towards the welfare of the constituency, irrespective of whether she would be elected next time or not"

#### **Cill formula**

The Natarajan panel also ad-<br>dressed some fresh issues, including a minimum requirement for recognised political parties to have women legislators. 'One of the points that came up for discussion before the Committee was the (M S) Gill Formula, which was a proposal of the Election Commission of India to make it mandatory for the recognised political parties to ensure putting of minimum agreed percentage of women in state Assembly and Parliamentary elections so as to allow them to retain the recognition with the Election Commission as political parties, the panel said.

Most of the parties that appeared before the committee, barring the SP, rejected the Gill formula "on the grounds that it might ead to political parties giving seats to women, which they perceive are not winning seats, thereby negating actual representation of vomen in elected bodies".

In conclusion, the committee said, "It is of the firm opinion that reserving seats for women in Assemblies and Lok Sabha should not be left to the discretion of political parties, rather it should be guaranteed in the Constitution itself and enforced by all means."

# Double representation

Another proposal that came up before the Natarajan committee was regarding double-member constituencies and increasing the number of seats in the Lok Sabha and Legislative Assemblies.

The committee discussed the ssue in detail. In its report, the panel said it does not endorse the concept of double-member constituencies, arguing that elected women representatives should be granted the same opportunities as their male counterparts.

"Providing for double-member constituencies might result in women being reduced to a subservient status, which will defeat the very purpose of the<br>Bill. Therefore, the Committee feels that this concept is discriminatory to women," it said.
