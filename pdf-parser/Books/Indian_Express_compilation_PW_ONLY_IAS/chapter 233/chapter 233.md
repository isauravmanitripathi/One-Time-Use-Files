BHIVPURI (MAHARASHTRA). NOVEMBER 28

TATA POWER, which recently signed an agreement with the Maharashtra government for development of two pumped hydro storage projects with combined capacity of 2,800 MW in the state, is targeting to start work on both the plants by mid of 2024.

In August this year, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed for the development of a 1,800 MW of  $\text{pumped hydro storage plant (PSP)}$ at Shirawata in Pune district and a 1,000 MW PSP at Bhivpuri in Raigad district. The proposed capital investment for the projects is Rs 13,000 crore. The company has planned a capex of around Rs

60,000 crore till FY2027. Pumped hydro project is a reliable and efficient way to store energy.

Under this, during times of excess energy, water will be pumped from lower reservoir to higher reservoir, and during peak demand, the stored water will power turbines, thereby generating electricity.

"We are targeting that by mid of next year (2024) we will start work on both the (pumped hydro) plants. We expect the Bhivpuri PSP to be ready in 36 to 40 months from there. So, by the end of 2027, we will be able to offer power from there (Bhivpuri PSP)," Tata Power's CEO and Managing Director Prayeer Sinha told reporters. "The Shirawata plant will take a little longer, maybe 48 months, but in 2028 we will do that. So, from 2027-28 onwards, we will be able to offer blended 24x7 renewable power to consumers," he said.

In the pumped hydro storage project, the same motor can be used bidirectional - in one direction to generate electricity and in the other to pump up water from lower reservoir to upper reservoir. It is a closed loop so there is no wastage of water, and whatever water comes, it flows into lower reservoir, which then is pumped up to upper reservoir during off peak hours using solar energy.

Tata Power already has a hydro power plant at Bhivpuri, which completed 100 years last year. The power station consists of a dam at Thokarwadi with reservoir storage capacity of 352 million cubic meters (MCM) of water.
