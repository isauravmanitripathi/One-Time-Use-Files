# 'Notable exception': What is India's **Energy Conservation** Building Code, 2017?

#### AGGAM WALIA NEW DELHI, NOVEMBER 8

INDIA WAS cited as a "notable exception" for being among the few emerging market and developing economies to have energy efficiency building codes. The Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) in its World Energy Outlook 2023 report has highlighted that India's Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC), 2017 for commercial buildings sets it apart from other developing economies where "energy efficiency in buildings stands out as a laggard". The ECBC was first released by the Ministry of Power's

Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) in 2007, followed by an update in 2017. Currently, 23 states have notified rules to enforce ECBC

compliance while large states like Maharashtra and Gujarat are still in the process of drafting rules.

Implementation of energy efficiency building codes like ECBC is important as buildings in India account for 30 per cent of total electricity consumption, a figure that is expected to touch 50 by 2042. per cent Furthermore, BEE notes that 40 per cent of buildings that will exist in the next twenty years are yet to be built, which gives policymakers and builders a unique opportunity to ensure that they are built in a sustainable manner.

### What is ECBC?

ECBC sets minimum energy standards for commercial buildings with the objective to save between 25 per cent to 50 per cent of energy use in compliant buildings. The code is applicable to commercial buildings like hospitals, hotels, schools, shopping complexes, and multiplexes which have a connected load of 100 kW or more, or contract demand of 120 kVA or more. It primarily looks at six components of building design including envelope (walls, roofs, windows), lighting systems HVAC systems, and electrical power system, and the requirements under each of these components are split between mandatory and prescriptive. ECBC is for both new buildings and retrofitting existing buildings. Compliant buildings are assigned one of three tags in ascending order of efficiency, namely ECBC, ECBC Plus, and Super ECBC.

Compared to ECBC, 2007. the updated code which was launched in 2017 has additional priorities of renewable energy integration, ease of compliance, inclusion of passive building design strategies, and flexibility for the designers.

While ECBC acts as a national standard, states across India have the flexibility to modify the code

depending on unique regional needs. To enforce the code, states have to draft rules and notify them as state laws.

#### Where do states stand in **ECBC implementation?**

Although 23 out of 28 states have notified ECBC rules, only 15 states have notified rules based on the latest ECBC, 2017. The latter includes states like Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Kerala. A total of five states, namely Gujarat,<br>Maharashtra, J&K, Ladakh, and Manipur, have yet to notify ECBC rules. By delaying the notification of ECBC rules. these states stand to lose out from the benefits of ensuring energy efficiency in commercial buildings. For instance, National Research Development Corporation notes that "Gujarat can save nearly 83 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy by 2030 with effective ECBC compliance, where around 90% of newly constructed commercial buildings would be compliant with some level of the ECBC."
