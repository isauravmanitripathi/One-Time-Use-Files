## FY25 FIGURE MAY BE SET AT 730.000 CR Govt may slash disinvestment target for next fiscal by 40%

NEW DELHI, JANUARY 4

THE CENTRE may aim for a modest disinvestment target of around ₹30,000 crore in 2024-25, 40% lower than the target of ₹51,000 crore for the current financial year, which is set to be missed by 60%. official sources said.

This would represent a progressive lowering of the ambition on this front, though the sources said the target for the next fiscal is being kept at realistic levels, considering that elections and new government formation would make it difficult to conclude any big-ticket sale in the year even if the process is initiated.

However, there will be lastditch efforts to bridge the gap between the disinvestment receipts for the current fiscal — ₹10,052 crore so far  $-$  and the budget estimate (₹51,000 crore). The plan is to hit the buoyant markets with a few offers for sale, before the vear draws to a close.

Non-debt capital inflows through this route could be around ₹20,000 crore or 40% of the target in FY24. The year has seen delays in the execution of the most of strategic disinvestment plans, including that of IDBI Bank, NMDC Steel and Container Corporation (Concor), partly due to a spate of

## state elections.

According to the sources, a few more OFSes that are to be expected in the January-March quarter are Indian Railway Finance Corporation, NLC India and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders. These firms are in the pipeline because they haven't met the market regulator's norm that the minimum public shareholding in listed firms should be at least 25%.

Of the transactions that the government could conclude next fiscal are that of the IDBI Bank disinvestment. wherein the Centre and LIC would together sell a 60.72% stake in the bank. FE
