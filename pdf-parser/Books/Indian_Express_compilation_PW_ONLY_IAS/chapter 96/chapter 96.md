NEW DELHI, SEPTEMBER 24

SINCE CANADIAN Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegation that the Indian government may have "potential links" to the killing of separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijiar in Canada, relations between the two countries are strained. Apart from the possible impact on trade and immigration, there are concerns that the issue can influence the countries' ties with their allies in the West.

Canada is part of the Five Eyes Alliance, an intelligence-sharing grouping with the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, also seen as India's allies.

#### Why was the alliance formed?

The origins of the alliance can be traced back to the Second World War. The UK and the US decided to share intelligence after successfully breaking German and Japanese codes, respectively.

In 1943, the Britain-USA (BRUSA) Agreement laid the foundations for what would become the UK-USA (UKUSA) agreement, after UK computer scientist Alan Turing's visit to Washington and several visits between the two countries' officials. The UKUSA was signed in 1946. Canada joined it in 1949, and New Zealand and Australia did so in 1956, forming the alliance. The Agreement was not officially acknowledged though its existence was known about from the 1980s. In 2010, the UKUSA agreement files were released.

### **How does the Five Eyes Alliance** work?

In recent years, common interests, such as balancing the rise of China, have led to a closer alignment among the Five Eyes countries. Some have attributed their closeness to a common language and mutual trust built over decades of association.

In 2016, the Five Eyes Intelligence Oversight and Review Council came into being. It includes the non-political intelligence oversight, review, and security entities of the Five Eyes countries. They exchange views of mutual interest, compare best practices, hold conference calls throughout the year and gather in person annually.

However, that closeness has not always meant uniformity in their foreign policy. Since 2021. New Zealand has stayed away from an outright condemnation of Chinese actions in Hong Kong and its treatment of the Uighur minority, unlike the other four countries. A major reason for this is the deep trade ties between them, with China being the biggest market for New Zealand's exports.

Meanwhile, the US has also sought to exert its influence through other groupings with like-minded countries on issues of security, like the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) featuring itself, Japan, Australia and India. The AUKUS grouping similarly includes Australia, the UK and the US.
