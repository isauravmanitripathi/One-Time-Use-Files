## EXPLAINED CLIMATE COP28: Much done, but still not enough

The annual climate conference arrived at a deal that saw some key resolutions on fossil fuels, funds to fight global warming, methane emissions, phase-down of coal, among others

THE COP28 climate meeting delivered some important outcomes - a first-time acknowledgement of the need to move away from fossil fuels; a first promise to reduce methane emissions; operationalisation of the loss and damage fund; and an agreement on global adaptation goals. However, like all previous COPs, it still remained an underachiever, unable to measure up to expectations, particularly in galvanising ambitious climate action in the immediate term.

## The expectations

COP28 was being seen as possibly the last opportunity to ensure that the world retained some hopes of keeping within the 1.5 degree Celsius warming threshold. The main agenda at COP28 was to carry out a Global Stocktake (GST), an assessment of where the world was in its fight against climate change and what more needed to be done. The GST is mandated by the Paris Agreement to be a periodic exercise, the first in 2023 and every five years thereafter.

COP28 was being held at a time when global warming was breaking new records. The year 2023 is already the hottest year ever. COP28, therefore, was expected to use the GST to stimulate more ambitious climate actions, particularly between now and 2030.

## The outcomes

However, COP28 disappointed on that front. There was little in the final agreement to accelerate climate action in the short term.

Fossil fuel phase-out: This was the most hotly contested issue at COP28. The role of fossil fuels in global warming had never been even acknowledged in any earlier COP decision, but this was getting increasingly untenable. After much deliberation, the final agreement called upon countries to contribute towards "transitioning away" from fossil fuels, "so as to achieve net zero by 2050". There were no schedules or targets. Some countries were extremely disappointed that the term "fossil fuel phase-out" had not been used.

Production and consumption of fossil fuels are unlikely to be curbed significantly in the near term, but it is an important, rather unavoidable, measure in the 2050 timeframe.

Tripling of Renewable Energy: This was an expected outcome, and the only one that contributes to additional emission reductions between now and 2030. The COP28 agreement calls upon countries to work towards tripling global installed capacity of renewable energy, and doubling of annual improvements in energy efficiency. Together, these two measures have the potential to avoid emissions of about 7 billion

tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent between now and 2030, more than the net result of all the other climate actions being currently taken. Tripling is a global target, and it is not incumbent on every country to individually triple its current capacity. It is thus not clear how this tripling would be ensured.

Phase-down of coal: Despite being a fossil fuel, coal has received a separate mention in the agreement. This is because coal was already singled out for phase down in the Glasgow conference in 2021. There was a move to stipulate that no new coal-fired power plants could be opened without an in-built carbon capture and storage facility, but this was strongly resisted by India, China, South Africa and other countries. It was dropped, and finally the Glasgow language was retained. There is nothing about how this phase-down is to be measured, or from what baseline.

Methane emission cuts: The agreement talks about "accelerating and substantially reducing non-carbon-dioxide emissions globally, including in particular methane emissions by 2030". Methane is the most widespread greenhouse gas apart from CO2, accounting for nearly 25% of all emissions. It is also about 80 times more potent than CO2 in causing global warming. Methane emission reductions can therefore bring substantial benefits. But several countries, including India, are extremely opposed to any mandate to cut methane emissions, mainly because one of the major sources happens to be agriculture and livestock.

The agreement does not mention any targets for methane emission cuts for the year 2030.

Loss and Damage Fund: For the poor and vulnerable countries, this was the most important outcome. A decision to set up a Loss and Damage Fund had been taken last year in Sharm el-Shaikh but it had not been created. COP28 operationalised this fund on the opening day of the conference, and several countries made funding commitments together worth about US\$ 800 million. The money is meant to help countries trying to recover from climate-induced disasters.

Global Goal on Adaptation: This was another important step developing countries had been waiting for. Historically, adaptation hasn't received enough attention, mainly because it is a local endeavour with local benefits.

But developing countries had been arguing that a global framework for adaptation was necessary. Accordingly, the Glasgow conference had decided to set up a two-year work programme to define the contours of this framework. The work programme resulted in the identification of some common adaptation goals, such as reduction in climate-induced water scarcity, attaining climate-resilience in food and agricultural production, and resilience against climate-induced health impacts.

COP28 adopted the framework, but it currently lacks financial provisions. Countries will need to strengthen it in the coming years.
