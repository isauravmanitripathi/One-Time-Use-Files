THERE IS A private sector-led revolution underway to lift 500 million people out of energy poverty. The transformation is thanks to clean energy mini-grids that are popping up in rural communities across Asia, Africa, Latin America and Small Island Developing States and, in the process, serving many small businesses and households. This success followed a first generation of government-supported mini-grids, which taught two essential lessons: The necessity of being adaptable to the needs of local communities and having a sustainable operational model.

According to the World Bank - which recently set a target to fund a thousand mini-grids in Nigeria, where over 90 million people still live without electricity private sector owned and operated solar mini-grids are the most cost effective and sustainable way to bring electricity for the first time to 75 per cent of the 675 million<br>people worldwide who still live in darkness most of them in Sub-Saharan Africa. It say: 20,000 mini-grids have been installed to date, and \$220 billion is needed to build the 2,10,000 mini-grids required to achiev these targets. Solar mini-grids are displacing the default energy source for rural communities - expensive and polluting diesel generation - at a fraction of the cost and with immediate environmental benefit.

But besides delivering reliable and clean power to these unserved communities, mini-grid companies are also offering a range of other services that drive rural prosperity - mobile telephony, irrigation, agroprocessing, e-mobility, to name a few. They also provide sales and financing of appliances that are otherwise unavailable. In other words, these are not merely electricity utilities providing power, they are rural development accelerators. In recent times, several heads of multilateral institutions. company executives and experts (including both co-authors of this article) have noted that while access to clean energy directly provides high-quality energy services, it can also enable other livelihood activities - they also provide opportunities in the healthcare and agriculture sector.

Decentralised energy systems like solar mini-grids are also emerging as an impor-<br>tant answer to climate shocks like drought, heat stress and flooding. This adaptation and resilience capability of mini-grids is critical for farming-dependent rural Africa and Asia, which are the world's most climate-vulnerable regions.

In the unlikely event that centralised grid infrastructure reaches these communities, mini-grids also offer an important complement. Cambodia is a prime example. Through the 1990s, hundreds of diesel-powered mini-grids were built and operated by local entrepreneurs. Eventually, they were connected to the main grid as local distributors. Today, more than 250 formerly isolated mini-grids are part of the national grid, helping serve more than 1 million consumers.

In India, about 700 solar mini-grids are<br>owned and operated by a handful of private

Solar is the cheapest form of energy generation in most countries, and its climate, energy and economic benefits are increasingly apparent. However, the current level of global solar investments represents only 10 per cent of the required amount to achieve<br>net-zero emissions. Notably, developing<br>countries, which are home to over 50 per ent of the global population, received a mere 15 per cent of renewable energy invest ments in 2022. In Sub-Saharan Africa, per apita investment in renewable energy concerning 44 per cent drop between 2019 and 2021. To put this into perspective, inve nents in North America are 41 times high in Europe, they are 57 times great

This glaring disparity, compounded by a bias towards large-scale solar projects, underscores a significant imbalance in the types of investments being made. To unlock the potential of smaller-scale solutions like solar mini-grids, it's imperative to imple nent guarantees and introduce innovative financial mechanisms complemented by robust risk underwriting that can catalyse private sector investment. The Internation Solar Alliance (ISA) is actively spearhead-<br>ing such an initiative through its Global Solar Facility (GSF). Geared towards<br>ratalysing investments in solar projects, the GSF places special emphasis on under-<br>served regions in Africa With a fund of \$100 million, it aims to enable \$10 billion in investments, providing clean energy access<br>for 35â€“40 million African households by 2030. This fund, fortified by payment guar-

antees, insurance, and investment vehicles, will mitigate risks and bolster investor confidence in decentralised solar applications in Africa, thus rectifying the skewed investment pattern in solar.

Solar energy presents a financially viable path to energy independence, bolstering security and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Moreover, the cost of solar PV energy s now highly competitive, standing at 24/MWh, lower than both coal and natural gas - this is, of course, contingent on sunlight availability. The substantial drop in solar module costs over the past decade underscores the holistic benefits of invest

ing in solar energy.<br>Creating a diverse energy mix, with adquate centralised and distributed renewable generation, is the future of energy, and is suitable especially in underserved markets where the cost of grid extension to rural, off-grid areas is prohibitive. Efficiently planned and well-run solar mini-grids rapidly provide strong and dependable gridlevel electricity, surpassing the reliability and cost-effectiveness of alternative elec-<br>trification methods. India's successful initiative to offer electricity through both large centralised grids and decentralised renewble energy sources is serving as an exemplar for clean energy adoption. It demonstrates how collaboration between private and public sectors can drive innovation, enabling developing economies to achieve a rajectory of robust energy supply with minimal carbon emissions.

Private mini-grids - combining solar with battery storage - are an affordable. technically mature, easily deployed, bankable solution that needs more support at a time when urgent energy access and climate action are required.
