# Why HPV vaccine push matters

Cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer among women in India. Universal HPV vaccination promises to put a significant dent in this number. Here's all you need to know

NEW DELHI, JANUARY 12

IN A bid to reduce cases of cervical cancer in the country, the government is set to roll out an immunisation campaign against the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) in the second quarter of 2024.

Over the next three years, girls between the ages of 9 and 14 years across India will be vaccinated for free in three phases. After this "catch-up" is completed, the HPV vaccine will be included in the government's routine immunisation programme for 9year-old girls.

## Why is an HPV vaccination campaign by the government important?

After breast cancer, cervical cancer is the econd most common cancer among women in India, although globally it is only the fourth most common cancer among women.

More than 95 per cent of all cervical cancer cases are linked to persistent infection with certain high-risk strains of HPV. What this essentially means is vaccination can be effectively used to prevent the infection, and thereby reduce cases of cervical cancer.

The vaccine is around 90 per cent effective in preventing cervical cancer. This is the reason more than 100 countries have now implemented HPV vaccination programmes," Dr Sarika Gupa, consultant of gynaecologic-oncology at Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute-New Delhi, told The Indian Express.

For a country like India, which reports around 1.25 lakh cases of cervical cancer  $-$  a fifth of all cases globally - and about 75,000 deaths due to the cancer each year, such a drive is especially important. Since HPV infection is also linked to cancers of the anus, vagina, and oropharynx, there is likely to be a drop in the incidence of these cancers as well.

Moreover, while the incidence of cervical cancer in India has been slowly declining over the years, there has been an increase in the incidence of other cancers. Preventing cervical cancer will free up overburdened hospitals for the treatment of these other cancers.

### How does the HPV vaccine work?

At least 14 HPV types have been identified to have the potential to cause cancer. Among these, HPV types 16 and 18 are considered to be the most oncogenic, causing about 70 per cent of all cervical cancer cases globally.

Quadrivalent vaccines prevent the entry of HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11, the four most common types of HPV. In this way, they prevent infec-

tions, genital warts, and eventually cancer. Universal immunisation of girls also reduces the transmission of the infection to boys, which protects them from other cancers as well.

Take the case of Australia, the first country to introduce an HPV vaccination programme in 2007. Studies have shown that the vaccination campaign reduced the specific HPV types from 22.7 per cent to 1.5 per cent in 10 years among young women. It also reduced the incidence of these HPV types from 11.8 per cent to 1.1 per cent during the same period among women over the age of 25 years who were not the focus of the vaccination programme. Australia added boys to its programme in 2013.

# Who should get the HPV vaccine?

The vaccine has to be administered in adolescent girls before they are sexually active. This is because the vaccine can only prevent the entry of the virus - it is not effective once someone is already exposed to a particular strain of HPV.

"HPV is a very common infection and 90 per cent of women who are sexually active already have it," Dr Gupta explained. "Other than that, the response to the vaccine is also better during adolescence," she said.

Although not covered by the planned government campaign, the vaccine can also be administered to adolescent boys, and is recommended for men who have sex with men (MSM).

## Can older women get immunised?

Yes. While the vaccine is not as effective among older women, it can still be administered up to the age of 45 years. Even if one has already been exposed to a particular strain of HPV, the vaccine is likely to protect them against other HPV strains that it covers.

Experts, however, suggest regular screening to be a better tool for older women. 'Women who have not received the vaccine must undergo a pap smear test and an HPV DNA test every five years. If the HPV DNA test shows that they have not yet been exposed to the virus, their chances of contracting cervical cancer remain low," Dr Gupta said.

The HPV DNA test is expensive, costing around Rs 3,500 to Rs 4,000. "In the absence of HPV DNA test, a pap smear should be done every three years," Dr Gupta said.

### Can a single dose of the vaccine protect against HPV?

As the government prepares to launch the vaccination campaign, the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation NTAGI) has recommended that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) conduct trials on the efficacy of a single-dose regimen of HPV vaccine in the age group of  $9-15$  years

According to the minutes of an NTAGI meeting held last year, the ICMR said a Phase-3 single-dose trial to test efficacy would take a long time - it would mean waiting for several years to observe a certain number of cancer cases in the group that hasn't been administered the vaccine. Instead, the ICMR study will look at antibody persistence after one dose of the vaccine.

While all of the HPV vaccines available globally state that a two-dose schedule has to be followed, the World Health Organisation recommends the use of a single-dose regimen for 9 to 14-year-olds under public health programmes. Its expert advisory group found "strikingly high efficacy" with one dose as well.

# Can you get the vaccine outside of the government campaign?

Yes. If you are not eligible to receive the vaccine under the government's campaign. or you would like to get it before the campaign is rolled out, SII's Cervavac is commercially available for Rs 2,000 per dose.
