# VVPATs and the fresh debate over them

#### **EXPRESS NEWS SERVICE** NEW DEI HI JANUARY 3

CONGRESS LEADER Jairam Ramesh has written to Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar requesting that a team of INDIA bloc leaders be provided an opportunity to meet him to put forward their views on VVPATs.

In his letter to Rajiv Kumar, Jairam Ramesh said that on December 20, 2023, IN-DIA leaders had requested for an appointment with the ECI based on a resolution passed at their meeting the previous day. The resolution had called for 100% verification of VVPAT slips.

# What are VVPATs?

When a vote is cast, the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machine, which is attached to the ballot unit of the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM), prints out a slip of paper with the voter's choice indicated on it. Though it remains behind glass, the printed

slip is visible for seven seconds so the voter can see her vote has been recorded correctly, before it falls into a box underneath.

The idea of the VVPAT machine emerged in 2010, when the ECI held a meeting with political parties to discuss ways to make the polling process more transparent. It was used for the first time in the Noksen Assembly

constituency of Nagaland in 2013, after which it was introduced elsewhere in a phased manner. The 2019 Lok Sabha elections became the first General Election to have 100% of EVMs having attached VVPATs.

# What percentage of VVPAT slips are counted at present?

The EC asked the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in 2018 to come up with a "mathematically sound, statistically robust and practically cogent sample size for the internal audit of the VVPAT slips with electronic result of EVMs", the ECI had told the Supreme Court last year.

The ECI also met political parties to discuss the issue, where demands for 10% to 100% counting emerged. In February 2018, the ECI mandated the counting of VVPAT slips of one randomly selected polling station per Assembly constituency. This was increased to five polling stations per Assembly seat, following an SC judgment in April 2019 on a petition filed by TDP leader Chandrababu Naidu.

Meanwhile, the ISI report to the EC in March 2019 recommended that a random sample of 479 EVMs be selected for counting of VVPAT slips.

# What has the ECI said on 100% counting?

Last year, the ECI told the Supreme Court that verification of VVPATs of five randomly selected polling stations per Assembly seat, with more than 4,000 total Assembly seats in India. translated to 20,600 EVM-VVPAT systems well above the ISI's recommendation of 479.

In Lok Sabha and Assembly elections so far, the EC said, 38,156 VVPATs have been checked randomly. "Not a single case of transfer of vote meant for candidate 'A' to candidate 'B' has been detected." the ECI said.

The ECI said pressing for 100% verification was a "regressive thought and tantamount to going back to the days of manual voting using ballot system". It said manual counting of all VVPAT slips would take time and introduce the potential of human error.
