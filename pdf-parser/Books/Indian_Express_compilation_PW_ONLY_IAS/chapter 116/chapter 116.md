COVID-19 SAW the fastest-ever develop-<br>ment of vaccines. The development time of<br>a vaccine, usually in decades, was brought<br>down to less than a year to tackle the pan-

demic. Some of it was due to the unprece-<br>dented mobilisation of resources to deal with

In addition, subsequent studies by the two also showed that the altered mRNA gen-<br>erated more proteins efficiently than the uni-<br>form ones. These discoveries eliminated crit-

### Vaccines before the pandemic

With the progress of molecular biology and techniques to edit genetic codes, vac-<br>cines using small, non-lethal parts of the<br>pathogen have been developed. These are called sub-unit vaccines.<br>Some vaccines also encode these non-

lethal parts to another pathogen that carries and distributes it throughout the body.

Why new vaccines worked
