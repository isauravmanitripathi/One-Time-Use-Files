# GIANT OZONE 'HOLE' FOUND OVER ANTARCTICA: REASON TO WORRY?

SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS over Antarctica have detected a giant 'hole' in the ozone layer above the frigid continent. The 'hole' spans an area of 26 million sq km, roughly three times the size of Brazil.

The recordings were made on September 16 by the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite of the European Space Agency (ESA).

#### What is the ozone layer?

Earth's atmosphere comprises five major layers: (from the lowest) troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere and exosphere. What is commonly re-

ferred to as the ozone layer is a region within the stratosphere (15-50 km above Earth's surface) where the concentration of ozone is  $the highest - although$ even at the laver's thickest, there are no more than a few molecules of ozone for every million air molecules.

Nonetheless, this layer is critical for planetary life as it absorbs harmful ultraviolet rays coming from the sun.

## What is an ozone 'hole'?

An ozone 'hole' is actually just an area where there is a depleted concentration of the gas.

This depletion was first noticed in the early 1980s, and considered by scientists at the time the greatest existential threat to life on Earth. It was much more pronounced over the South Pole.

By the mid-1980s, scientists figured that the chief cause of this depletion was the use of a class of industrial chemicals. most common in which were chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), that were used extensively in the air conditioning, refrigeration, paints, and furniture industries.

### Is the problem being fixed?

After the Montreal Protocol came into effect in 1989, there has been a steady re-

duction in the use of 'ozone depleting substances' and consequently, the 'hole' has slowly shrunk.

As per latest estimates, most of the ozone layer will be restored to its 1980 state by the 2040s, with the 'hole' over the Antarctic - the biggest of them all set to be repaired by 2066.

#### What about the latest 'hole' then?

The size of the 'hole' over the Antarctic is linked to unique meteorological conditions - temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction - that prevail over the continent. In fact, the 'hole' grows and shrinks throughout the year, being at its largest between September and November.

Claus Zehner, ESA's mission manager for the Copernicus Sentinel-5P, told DW that the 'hole' opens up due to Earth's rotation. "The winds create a mini climate, creating a shield over Antarctica preventing it from mixing with surrounding air. When the winds die down, the hole closes," he said.

He added that the size of the 'hole' this year could be due to a particularly violent volcanic eruption off the coast of Tonga in 2022, which sent

a lot of water vapour and other chemicals to the stratosphere.

#### So, is there reason to worry?

Scientists are confident that this year's 'hole' is not a cause for concern.

However, in recent years, climate change has shown signs of undoing the progress made over the past three decades.

Scientists have found that global warming-induced wildfires, which are getting more frequent and intense around the world, might be depleting ozone layers once again. The larger-thanusual Antarctic ozone holes in both 2020 and 2021 were linked to wildfires.
