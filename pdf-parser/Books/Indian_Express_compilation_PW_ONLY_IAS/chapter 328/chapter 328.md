## Sebi probing 'mule accounts', 3 IPO applications on the radar

## ENS ECONOMIC BUREAU MUMBAI, JANUARY 19

SECURITIES AND Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is probing cases of mule accounts and inflated initial public offering (IPO) applications which are meant to jack up share sale subscription numbers, its Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch said on Friday.

There are three cases which have come to the notice of the capital markets regulator, Buch said, without divulging any further details. Some of the merchant bankers who are involved in such unauthorised activities are also under Sebi's radar.

"Mule accounts...we all know how those work. We are now getting evidence and data about it," Buch said while speaking at an event organised by the Association of Investment Bankers of India (AIBI).

"The second is in terms of inflating the IPO application numbers to give an impression of high subscriptions. So, either people who withdraw their (IPO) applications later or even

worse, apply in a manner that their applications get rejected. So, you put in hundreds of crores of applications with multiple PANs (permanent account numbers) knowing that they will get rejected," Buch said.

These are the kind of practices which are being observed and the regulator has data on it, she said.

A mule account includes a trading account maintained with a stock broker or a dematerialised or bank account linked with such trading account in the

## name of a person, where the account is effectively controlled by another person.

The chairperson said Sebi is unhappy about such malpractices, and will soon come out with some directions to crack down on them.

The regulator has been able to detect a pattern in the kind of merchant bankers who indulge in such activities on a frequent hasis

"There are three cases before us. We would need much more data to be able to assess as to

what would be the next step in this," she said.

On IPO investments, Buch said data shows that the percentage of flippers (investors who exit a company within a short period of time after the listing date) within a week is high.

In 2023, 57 domestic corporates raised Rs 49,434 crore through main board IPOs.

"The percentage of people who flip in the first week in any IPO in the NII (non-institutional investor) category, which is high net worth (HNI) category, is 68 per cent, and in the retail category, which is less than Rs 2 lakh, it is 43 per cent," Buch said.

After one month of the listing date, 76 per cent of NII and 52 per cent of retail investors exit a company, she said.

Talking about IPO pricing, Buch said the price discovery mechanism of IPOs currently is imperfect.

She suggested that a retail investor who wants to hold shares for a reasonable period should wait until the share price of a company stabilises after listing or possibly wait until the first set of quarterly results.
