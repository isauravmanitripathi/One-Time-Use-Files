PRIME MINISTER Narendra Modi and Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe inaugurated a ferry service connecting India and Sri Lanka on Saturday, nearly four decades after the last such service was cancelled amid civil war in the island nation.

The ferry plies between Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu and Kankesanthurai in Sri Lanka's Jaffna.

Connectivity is not only about bringing two cities closer. It also brings our countries closer, our people closer and our hearts closer," Modi said in a video message, in which he recalled Nagapattinam's rich history of maritime trade. He referenced the song Sindhu Nadhivin Misai by the iconic Tamil poet. Subramania Bharati, that touches on a bridge between the two countries. "The ferry service brings alive all those historical and cultural links," Modi said.

The PM also provided a broader perspective on India's collaboration with Sri Lanka, saying fintech, energy, and digital payments were potential spheres of mutual benefit.

The ferry service was revived following Sri Lankan President Wickremesinghe's recent visit to India. In his video message, Wickremesinghe called it an important step towards strengthening the connectivity between India and Sri Lanka.

"People of both countries have travelled across the Palk Strait for many years... The ferry services operated in the past were suspended due to the civil war in Sri Lanka. Now, the connectivity has been re-established," he said.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who also virtually addressed the inauguration, termed it a strategic initiative.

"The launch of the ferry service is a truly big step for boosting people-to-people contacts," he said. Emphasising on India's 'neighbourhood first' policy, he said the maritime initiative would foster enhanced connectivity, cooperation, and contact.

Furthermore, he invoked India's SAGAR (Security and Growth For All in the Region) policy, emphasising the country's role in maritime security, disaster response, and environmental safety.

The ferry, Jaishankar said, "underlines the assistance India provided for the has Kankesanthurai harbour", Union minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Tamil Nadu minister E V Velu were also at the event.
