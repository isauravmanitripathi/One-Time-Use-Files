# Why Kashmir is without snow

While snowfall in Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir has been declining in recent years, this winter has been remarkably dry so far. Fewer Western Disturbances, rising temperatures, El Niño could be responsible

NEW DELHI, JANUARY 16

ONE OF Kashmir's main winter tourism attractions, Gulmarg, has been bereft of snow so far this season, leading to a sharp decline in the flow of tourists, which has severely hit the business of ski resorts. Government data show that 95,989 tourists, including 547 foreigners, visited Gulmarg in January 2023. Data for January 2024 are yet to be compiled, but officials said tourist arrivals seem to be at least 60 per cent lower this year.

Snow in Kashmir, however, is much more than just a tourist attraction. It is crucial for the local climate, winter crops and horticulture, the availability of water in streams and rivers, and for the local economy.

### Dry winter

Although the lack of snow is most visible in Gulmarg, the whole of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh have remained largely without rain or snow this winter.

Winter precipitation in Jammu and Kashmir, as also Ladakh, is mainly in the form of snow. Normally, the region gets its first snowfall in the first half of December, and then through most of January. But it has been mostly dry this season.

I&K saw an 80% rainfall deficit in December, and the deficit has been 100% in January so far - meaning there has been no rain at all - India Meteorological Department (IMD) data show. Ladakh has had no precipitation at

## all in December or January.

While snowfall in the region has been showing a declining trend in recent years, the situation this season is remarkable.

The overall decreasing trend of snowfall has been attributed to a decline in Western Disturbance events and gradual rise in temperatures, which involves the role of climate change. The prevailing El Niño event in the eastern Pacific Ocean might be the additional factor to account for this year, scientists say.

# **Role of Western Disturbances**

Winter precipitation in the Himalayan region is caused mainly by Western Disturbances. These are large eastward-moving rain-bearing wind systems that originate beyond Afghanistan and Iran, picking up moisture from as far as the Mediterranean Sea and even the Atlantic Ocean.

Western Disturbances are the primary source of rainfall over north and northwest India during the post-monsoon and winter months. Along with the south-west monsoon season that runs from June to September, and the north-east monsoon that brings rain to Tamil Nadu and some other regions. Western Disturbances are the third major contributor to India's annual rainfall.

During winter, about four to six Western Disturbance events happen every month on an average. This season, there was only one feeble Western Disturbance event in December that did not bring any rain, and another similar one in January.

"Western Disturbances have been showing a declining trend in recent times. In some years we have seen just two or three events a month, when normally five or six are expected. Because of this, the overall precipitation during the winter months in the northern regions has been declining," A P Dimri an atmospheric scientist who is currently the director of Mumbai-based Indian Institute of Geomagnetism, said.

Several recent studies, including those by Dimri, have captured this declining trend. One of them noted that the mean frequency of strong and extreme Western Disturbances. ones that definitely result in rainfall or snowfall, had declined by as much as 43 per cent in recent years.

"The other, connected thing is that temperatures in these regions are rising. The rate of increase of temperature is seen to be higher in the upper elevation areas than in the plains... In fact, look at the temperatures in Kashmir this winter. On many days, Srinagar temperatures have been comparable to those of Delhi, and sometimes even higher," Dimri said. "This is also contributing to the decline in snowfall," he added.

### Impact of El Niño

Indeed, there have been several years in the past one decade  $-2022$ , 2018, 2015  $$ when winter has been relatively dry in Jammu and Kashmir, and snowfall has been very less. Mukhtar Ahmad, head of the Srinagar centre of IMD, said the situation this winter might be compounded by El Niño.

"For the past few months, El Niño has persisted and will continue to do so in the coming months. This has affected the global atmospheric circulation, and might be contributing to the deficit precipitation in the region," Ahmad said.

However, El Niño alone was not the reason, he said. Ahmad pointed out that even in the absence of El Niño, some years had seen very little snowfall.

"In recent years, 2022 (December), 2018 (December-January), 2015 (January), 2014 (December), 1998 (December-January) and 1992 (December) were dry," Ahmad said.<br>Dimri agreed that the declining snowfall

in Kashmir could be a direct fallout of climate change. "Indeed, I do think that climate change has a role to play here. Many of our studies point in that direction," he said.

# Far-reaching repercussions

Less snowfall in the region is expected to have both short-term and long-term consequences. Long-term implications include the generation of less hydroelectricity, an increase in the rate of glacier-melting, and an adverse impact on drinking water supply, since scanty snowfall means very little recharge of groundwater.

In the short term, a dry spell can result in an increase in forest fires, agricultural drought, and a drop in crop production. "It can lead to an early spring and thus early flowering, which can cause a reduction in yield," Ahmad said.

The winter snow is a source of steady moisture to the soil that is vital for winter crops, particularly horticulture. Yields of apples or saffron, important ingredients of the local economy, are badly affected in the absence of snowfall.
