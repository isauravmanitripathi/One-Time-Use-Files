### **UDIT MISRA** NEW DELHI, JANUARY 15

ACCORDING TO the latest official release. India's consumer price index (CPI) based inflation rate touched 5.7% in December. While this is a routine - monthly - release, its timing is significant for a variety of reasons.

For one, from the point of fiscal policy, this is the last inflation data release before the Union Budget on February 1. Two, from the point of monetary policy, it will be the most recent data available with the Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India before its reconvenes in later February. Lastly, this is the first release in the election year and, as such, it can be more politically significant than usual.

## What is CPI inflation?

The CPI inflation is nothing but the rate<br>of inflation consumers face. It is different from the major inflation indicator - the wholesale price index-based inflation rate.

According to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), which releases the data, the consumer price index measures "changes over time in general level of prices of a basket of selected goods and services that households acquire for the purpose of consumption".

At an all-India level, the current CPI basket comprises 299 items.

Apart from an aggregate index, consumer price indices are constructed for both rural and urban consumers.

### How is it calculated?

The "base year" for the current series of indices is 2012. In other words, the price index is given a value of 100 for 2012 and changes from these price levels are then calculated to arrive at inflation rates for each good or service.

According to the National Statistical Office within the MoSPI, the monthly price data is collected from 1,181 villages and 1,114 urban markets across the country. The data for this purpose is collected on a weekly basis by the field staff of NSO.

## What are its components?

The CPI has six main components, each

Among these, food articles currently weigh 54% of the total index. The secondbiggest component is that of miscellaneous services. Within the food category, cereal prices are the biggest factor  $-$  they account for 12.4% of the total CPI.

This means that a spike in prices of food articles like cereals, vegetables, milk and pulses tends to have the biggest impact on consumer inflation. And the reason why food articles have been given such a high weightage is that most Indian consumers tend to spend a considerable portion of their income towards meeting their food demand.

# What do the data show?

The inflation rate for any period can be analysed in two ways. One is to compare this December's price level with December last year. The inflation rate  $-$  or the rate at which prices have gone up  $-$  so calculated is called the year-on-year increase. This is the most-<br>often used inflation rate.

However, one can also calculate the

month-on-month change by comparing the prices in December to the prices in lovember.

The data show that the YoY inflation rate has started rising towards the end of 2023. The MoM data, however, shows deflation in December.

Among the different components, it was the relative spike in food prices that caused the YoY inflation to rise in December. In particular, vegetable prices increased by almost 28% (relative to December 2022), while pulses were costlier by 21% and spices by 20%. Cereals, too, were costlier by 10%. Such high levels of inflation in just these four food groups, which account for 23% of the total index weight, pushed up the overall inflation rate.

Lastly, as always, the inflation rate varied across the country, with Odisha registering the highest inflation at 8.7% and Delhi experiencing the lowest at 2.9%.

## What is the significance?

Most analysts, like Dipti Deshpande of CRISIL, expect the inflation rate to ease in the coming months as the kharif harvest as well as government interventions bring down food inflation. On the whole, inflation for the full financial year is likely to be 5.5% with the March

2024 inflation rate expected to be at 5%.

Further, regardless of what is happening to headline inflation, the core inflation rate that is inflation rate after removing food and fuel inflation - has been trending down.

However, from the perspective of monetary policy, the latest inflation data is likely to delay the cut in interest rates (read EMIs) Before inflation reversed its trend and started rising in November and December, there were many who had hoped that the RBI would cut rates as early as April this year. However, it now looks unlikely that RBI will cut interest rates before August.

"Important to note is the RBI view that food shocks can have second order effects that impede attaining policy goals. Hence we believe that the RBI is unlikely to pivot soon - both on the rates as also on the stance of monetary policy... Effectively, we think the expected growth-inflation dynamics can lead to a shallow rate cut only starting in August 2024," said Indranil Pan, Chief Economist of Yes Bank.

Higher inflation is also not good news for scal policymakers. Partly, this has to do with the political ramifications that rising inflation rate can have so close to the elections. But from the perspective of Budget making too, uncertainty around inflation is hardly welcome.
