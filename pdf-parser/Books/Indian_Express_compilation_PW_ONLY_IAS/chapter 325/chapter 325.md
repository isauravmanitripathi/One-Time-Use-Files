## Rate cuts not even under discussion: RBI Governor

ENS ECONOMIC BUREAU MUMBAI, JANUARY 18

RESERVE BANK of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das on Thursday said until the 4 per cent inflation target is achieved on a durable basis, it would be premature to talk about cuts in the repo rate - the key policy rate.

In an interview to Bloomberg in Davos, Das said consumer price index (CPI) inflation has moderated from a peak of 7.8 per cent immediately after the onset of the Ukraine-Russia war and has come within the RBI's target range of 2-6 per cent.

"Unless we reach 4 per cent (inflation target), and see clear evidence that it (inflation) is going to sustain at that level, it would be really premature to talk about rate cuts. At the moment, the topic of rate cuts is not on our table. It is not even under discussion," Das said when asked if there was a possibility of a rate cut in the second half of 2024. He said the average inflation is expected to be at  $4.5$ per cent in financial year 2024-25 (FY25). The RBI's focus is to remain actively disinflationary and to bring CPI inflation to 4 per cent on a sustainable basis.

When asked if there would be no rate cuts in 2024, Das stated that it would depend on many factors but he would not like to give any forward-looking statement.

"There are new geo-political flashpoints developing. Climate change and weather-related events are also affecting food prices. New bottlenecks and impediments to global supply chains are also coming up. So therefore,

on the matter of rate cuts, whether it will happen during 2024 or 2025, or whether it will not happen. I would not like to give any kind of forward guidance," he said.

In its December monetary policy, the RBI left the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent for the fifth time in a row, on worries over higher inflation amid uncertain food prices. It raised the policy rate by 250 basis points (bps) between May 2022 and February 2023. One basis point is one-hundredth

of a percentage point.

## 'Objective should be to secure real GDP growth of at least 7%'

Mumbai: For financial year 2024-25, the focus should be to sustain growth momentum by securing real GDP growth of at least 7 per cent, an article published in the RBI's monthly bulletin for January said.

For the current fiscal ending March 31, 2024, the RBI has projected real GDP growth of 7 per cent. The first advance estimate, released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) earlier this month, said the country's economy is expected to grow at 7.3 per cent in the current fiscal. On Wednesday, RBI Governor

Shaktikanta Das in Davos said the GDP growth in India will touch 7 per cent in 2024-25.

"In India, potential output is picking up with actual output running above it, although the gap is moderate. In 2024-25, the objective should be to sustain this momentum by securing real GDP growth of at least 7 per cent in an environment of macroeconomic stability," the RBI article said. Accordingly, inflation needs to align with the target by the second quarter of the year, as projected, and get it anchored there, it said. ENS
