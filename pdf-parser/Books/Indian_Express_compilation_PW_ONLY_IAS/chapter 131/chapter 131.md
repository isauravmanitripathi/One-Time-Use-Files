# The story so far:

lexei I. Ekimov, Louis E. Brus, and Moungi G. Bawendi have been awarded<br>the 2023 Nobel Prize for chemistry "for<br>the discovery and synthesis of quantum dots".

What is a quantum dot?<br>A quantum dot is a really small assembly of<br>atoms (just a few thousand) around a few<br>nanometres wide. The 'quantum' in its name<br>comes from the fact that the electrons in these<br>atoms have very little

### Why are they of interest?

There are two broad types of materials: atomic<br>and bulk. Atomic of course refers to individual<br>atoms and their specific properties. Bulk refers<br>to large assemblies of atoms and molecules. **Ouantum** dots lie somewhere in between and

Quantum dots lie somewhere in between and<br>behave in ways that neither atoms nor bulk<br>materials do. One particular behaviour<br>distinguishes them: the properties of a quantum<br>dot change based on how big it is. Just by<br>tweakin

So, quantum dots can be<br>easily adapted for a variety of applications<br>including surgical oncology, advanced<br>electronics, and quantum computing.

## What did the Nobel laureates do?

What did the Nobel laureates do?<br>For centuries, people have been creating<br>coloured glass by tinting it with a small amount<br>of some compound. How much of the<br>compound, or dopant, is added and how the<br>glass is prepared chang changed this. They added different amounts of copper chloride to a glass before heating it to<br>different temperatures for different durations,<br>tracking the dopants' structure and properties.<br>They found that the glass's colour changed They found that the glass's colour changed <br>depending on the size of the copper chloride <br>nanocrystals (which depended on the <br>preparation process) â€“ a telltale sign that the <br>crystals were quantum dots. In 1983, a group l dots, working out a mathematical description of<br>their behaviour and how it related to their<br>structure. But both of them lacked one thing: a<br>simple way to make quantum dots with just the

makes their surfaces smooth. Finally, crystals of<br>the desired size can simply be filtered out. This<br>method accelerated the adoption of quantum<br>dots in a variety of technologies.

What are quantum dots' applications?<br>An array of quantum dots can be a TV screen by<br>receiving electric simals and emitting light of<br>different colours. Scientists can control the path<br>of a chemical reaction by placing some energy levels an electron jumps between in a<br>quantum-dot atom is the conduction band, the quantum-dot atom is the conduction band, the <br>dot can operate like a semiconductor.
