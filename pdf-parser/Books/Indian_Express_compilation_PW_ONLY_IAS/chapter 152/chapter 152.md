PRESSTRUSTOFINDIA NEW DELHI. OCTOBER 17

STATES ARE on course to spend 29 per cent more on capital expenditure in the ongoing fiscal, aided by additional central grants and market borrowings, a report said on Tuesday.

The increased capex spending will see their debt-level in relation to their gross domestic product rising to  $30$  per cent from  $28.9$ per cent in FY23, a report by Icra Ratings said.

The combined capital spending of 13 major states will rise  $29$ per cent this fiscal to Rs 6.2 lakh crore from Rs 4.8 lakh crore in FY23, the report said.

However, despite the year-onyear growth, the capex spending is likely to be Rs 50,000 crore lower than the FY24 Budget estimates of Rs 6.7 lakh crore, Icra said.

The aggregate fiscal deficit of these states for FY24 is expected to go up by Rs 60,000 crore to Rs 8.3 lakh crore as against the budgeted estimate of Rs 7.7 lakh crore, the ratings agency said.
