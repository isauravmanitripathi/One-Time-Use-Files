## Rule of law vs right to liberty: What Court said

## **KHADIJA KHAN**

NEW DELHI, JANUARY 8

WHILE QUASHING the Gujarat government's decision to grant remission to the convicts in the Bilkis Bano case, the Supreme Court on Monday acknowledged the importance of personal liberty as a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution, but also sought to address the question of whether the rule of law can prevail over it.

It also addressed the issue of whether the convicts should be sent back to prison or be given the benefit of liberty, despite the orders forming the basis for their release being declared "ille-

EXPLAINED

gal" and "wholly without jurisdiction".

Defined by the architect of the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780, John

Adams, as "a government of laws and not of men", the rule of law is a concept that acts as a check to the executive's lawlessness, by ensuring that no official or administrator can arrest or detain a person without legislative sanction.

In the present case, the court explained the concept to mean that whenever the State fails to perform its duties, the court will step in "to ensure that the rule of law prevails over the abuse of the process of law". Such abuse could stem from inaction, arbitrary actions of protecting offenders, or failure of different authorities to discharge obligations according to the law, the court said.

Adding that breaching the rule of law amounts to negating equality, as prescribed by Article 14, the court said that "equality" before law would itself become an "empty" word if its violation was not a matter of judicial scrutiny, and if courts didn't enforce the rule of law. "Judiciary is the guardian of the rule of law and the central pillar of a democratic State," the Bench said.

"Importantly, rule of law means no one, howsoever high or low, is above the law; it is the basic rule of governance and democratic polity," the court said, adding that the concept is "closely intertwined" with adjudication by courts of law. Therefore, the judiciary has to carry out its obligations favouring the rule of law, it said.

The SC said it must be a "beacon in upholding rule of law". adding that it would otherwise lead to a situation where all courts in the country apply the concept "selectively" and become "unmindful", resulting in 'a dangerous state of affairs in our democracy". Holding that compassion and sympathy have

> no role to play where rule of law is required", the court said that the rule of law forms the essence of a democracy, and should be "preserved" and en-

forced by courts without fear, favour, affection, or ill-will.

"Everyone within the framework of the rule of law must accept the system, render due obedience to orders made, and in the event of failure of compliance, the rod of justice must descend down to punish," it said. The existence of the rule of law and the fear of being brought to book operate as deterrents "to those who have no scruples in killing others if it suits their ends," it said.

Citing the words of the late Justice V R Krishna Iver, the court said, "the finest hour of the rule of law is when law disciplines life and matches promise with performance", adding that justice "should remain loyal to the rule of law". Referring to Justice H R Khanna's dissenting judgment in ADM, Jabalpur vs. Shivakant Shukla (1976), the court said "rule of law is the antithesis of arbitrariness".

Rejecting the convicts' plea for protection of liberty, the court held that the rule of law must prevail and the orders of remission be set aside.
