# How the online dispute resolution system announced by Sebi will work

# **GEORGE MATHEW** MUMBAI. AUGUST 5

A NEW online dispute resolution (ODR) system involving institutions, conciliators and arbitrators for the capital market is on its way. On July 31, market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) issued a circular, streamlining the existing dispute resolution mechanism in the securities market under the aegis of stock exchanges and depositories - Market Infrastructure Institutions  $-$  by establishing a common ODR portal. The new system will harness online conciliation and online arbitration for resolution of disputes arising in the securities market.

What are ODR institutions? According to Sebi, each MII will identify and empanel one or

more independent ODR institutions. These institutions will have qualified conciliators and arbitrators. MIIs will, in consultation with their empanelled ODR institutions, establish and operate a common ODR portal. All listed companies, specified intermediaries and regulated entities in the

securities market (referred to as market participants) will enrol on the ODR portal.

## Who can form ODR institutions?

Sebi has not specified who will qualify as ODR institutions. "Prima facie it looks like outsourcing of investor dispute resolution with the involvement of private ODR institutions," said a market observer. "Should these ODRinstitutions be registered as companies or whether Sebi should register them? What will

be the organisational structure of ODR institutions? It's not clear." he said.

## What's the procedure?

An investor or client should first take up the grievance with the market participant by lodging a complaint directly with the

> concerned market participant. If the grievance is not redressed satisfactorily, the investor or client may escalate the same through the SCORES

Portal. After exhausting all available options, if the investor or the client is still not satisfied, he or she can initiate dispute resolution through the ODR Portal. The first step is conciliation. If this fails, the next step isarbitration.

## Implementation timeline

The ODR provisions will be

implemented in phases: The first phase will include development of the ODR portal, and empanelment of ODR institutions, conciliators and arbitrators before August 1. Then the registration of trading members and depository participants should be done by August 15, and commencement of registering of complaints against brokers and depository participants and their resolution from August 16, according to the market regulator.

The second phase will include registration of all other market participants on the ODR Portal by September 15. This will be followed by commencement of registering of complaints/disputes against all other market participants and their resolution on and from September 16, and implementation of related processes and requirements with effect by September 16.
