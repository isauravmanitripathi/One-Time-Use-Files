A GI tag is a sign assigned to products that have a specific geographical origin, and possess their intrinsic qualities due to said origin. They assure consumers of the quality and authenticity of the product, while protecting interests of local producers.

In India, GI tags are awarded by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of Commerce and Industry. GI registration is given to an area, not a trader. Those dealing with a GI tagged product can apply to sell with the GI logo. Authorised traders are then each assigned a unique GI number. Crucially, unauthorised traders can be prosecuted under The Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999.

Here are seven products from Odisha which bagged the GI tag last Thursday.
