The situation around the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, a crucial shipping route connecting the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean, has escalated due to recent attacks by Yemen-based Houthi militants.

Due to these attacks, the shippers are taking consignments through the Cape of Good Hope, resulting in delays of almost 14 days and also higher freight and insurance costs. The Red Sea route is also crucial for energy shipments.

Also, on his outlook on inflation for 2024, the eminent economist said he expects a benign outcome where inflation trends down and growth remains robust.
