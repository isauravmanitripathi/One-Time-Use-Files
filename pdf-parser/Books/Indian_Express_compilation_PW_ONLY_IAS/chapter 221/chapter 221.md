## Marriage does not eclipse person's right to privacy, says Karnataka HC

EXPRESS NEWS SERVICE BENGALURU, NOVEMBER 28

IN A CASE where a woman has sought the UIDAI details of her husband including his address, a Dharwad bench of the Karnataka High Court ruled that a person's right to privacy cannot be waived by marriage.

The order was passed on November 10 by a division bench consisting Justices Sunil Dutt Yadav and Vijaykumar Patil.

An appeal had been filed by UIDAI officials against an earlier 2023 order where the man has bee allegedly absconding after a family court order directed him to pay maintenanace to her. Officials argued that according to Section 33 of the Aadhaar Act, UIDAI holders have a right to privacy and a court could not issue issue such an order without hearing the other person as well.

The woman's counsel argued that the details could be shared as the identity of both were merged after marriage and that enforcing the maintenance order could only be done by proceeding against the husband as he had been absconding.

"The right to privacy of Aadhaar number holder preserves the autonomy of the individual's right to privacy which is conferred primacy and admits of no exception under the statutory scheme. The relationship by marriage, which is a union of two partners, does not eclipse the right to privacy which is the right of an individ-

ual and the autonomy of such individual's right stands recognised and protected by the procedure of hearing contemplated under Section 33. The marriage by itself does not do away with the procedural right of hearing conferred under Section 33 of Aadhaar Act," the bench observed.

The bench then remitted the matter back to the previous judge to be heard again with the provision that the husband should be made a respondent in the case.
