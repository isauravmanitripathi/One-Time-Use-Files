## THE UNEQUAL DEEPFAKE RISK

Law to tackle it must be sensitive to burdens, vulnerabilities of women

RECENTLY, A DEEPFAKE video of actor Rashmika Mandanna went viral. A video posted by British-Indian influencer Zara Patel was morphed to splice Mandanna's head onto Patel's body. As digital platforms proliferate in an attention economy, the dissemination of deepfakes with unprecedented speed and finesse, at little to no cost to the creators, has already increased the objectification of women online. The sophistication of the technology makes deception easy and the ease of its availability and use makes detection difficult.

Women's exercise of bodily autonomy invites disproportionate stigma in India Societally defined roles determine women's mobility, making their access to public spaces conditional, requiring adherence to a code of conduct. The online sphere where the average internet user may not fully understand what "Terms of Use" she is "consenting" to, further complicates this spatial register.

Women's unwilling embodiment online has been termed a "double embodiment". Women are disproportionately "bodied", that s, over-identified with their physical charac teristics, as compared to men in the offline world. Similar objectification awaits them online. Thus, women's loss of liberty in cyber space is a second loss, exacerbating the impact of their offline social subordination.

Against this context, women who post videos and photos of themselves to their social media accounts should not be considered to have consented to any and all subsequent uses of their depictions just because these accounts have not been set to "private".

Social media content creation today has emerged as a form of gig work. While participants can view it as a natural medium for selfexpression, platform design also enables the Allowing attention-grabbing deepfakes that profit from the male gaze generates higher advertisement revenues for platforms by driving up engagement and harming vulnerable users. Apart from causing economic, physical, and/or psychological harm to victims, it stifles their right to free speech, forcing them to often shut down their profiles. This restricts women's access to the technological means of production in an age of informational capitalism.

monetisation of content, audiences, and skills. The concept of honour in India is closely tied to ideas of possession - control of and ownership over women's bodies. Women on social media often reject this concept by reworking the dominant frames that regard them as sexualised property. They navigate heteronormative and capitalist metrics of value on social media for their profit.

However, allowing attention-grabbing<br>deepfakes that profit from the male gaze generates higher advertisement revenues for platforms by driving up engagement and harming vulnerable users. Apart from causing eco nomic, physical, and/or psychological harm to victims, it stifles their right to free speech. forcing them to often shut down their profiles. This restricts women's access to the techno logical means of production in an age of informational capitalism.

According to research by IT for Change, in India, one-third of the women surveyed reported that they had faced harassment, abuse or unwanted behaviour online and two-fifths knew women in their circles who had similar experiences. Ninety per cent of the responlents who had faced harassment reported having faced it on multiple occasions. The vit riol faced by Dalit women was unsurprisingly casteist as well. Further, data indicating a wide gap between male and female users of social media platforms reveals the starkly gendered digital divide in the country. For instance, as per Instagram demographics, around 27.5 per cent of Instagram users in India are women. while around 72.5 per cent are men.

The Supreme Court in KS Puttaswamy v Union of India noted that "people do not want to...become inaccessible as much as they want their information to be treated in accor-

dance with their expectations". Women do not want to retreat from publicity, and they should not be forced to. Especially when the Supreme Court has afforded express legal recognition to privacy interests in public spaces by observing that "if dignity is the underlying feature, the basis of recognising the right to privacy is not denuded in public spaces". Hence, when a social media user's post is deepfaked by a third party, concerns regarding consent get implicated along with unequal bargaining power and informational asymmetries to constitute a violation of the iser's right to privacy.

As per the prevailing legal position, mod-<br>eration policies and platform design focus largely on negative freedoms (freedom from). However, there is a need to evolve frameworks which also promote positive freedoms (freedom for), such as the right to (equal) public participation, or the right to publicness

In her tweet, Mandanna expressed that had this happened to her when she was in school or college, she would not have been<br>able to tackle it. The virality, instantaneity, anonymity and permanence afforded by the use of generative AI in an unforgiving online medium renders all of us terrifyingly vulnerable. But not all of us are equally vulnerable.

Legal frameworks to tackle deepfakes must be sensitive to the burdens that women and other minorities bear to access the benefits of publicity, their additional vulnerabilities, and the incorrectly presumed renunciation of their rights once they choose to commodify some aspects of their identities online.
