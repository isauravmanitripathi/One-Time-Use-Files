FARMERS, FOR the most part, operate in a buyer's market. Since their produce — bar-<br>ring maybe milk — is harvested and mar-<br>keted in bulk, it leads to sudden supply increases relative to demand, putting<br>downward pressure on prices.<br>Such market conditions also mean farm-

ers are price takers, not price makers. Lacking the market power to influence the Lacking the market power to influence the<br>prices of their produce, they sell at prevail-<br>ing supply-and-demand-determined rates.<br>Worse, while their crops are sold wholesale,<br>they pay retail prices for everything they<br>buy f

#### How to guarantee MSP

One traditional way is to force buyers to<br>pay MSP. Sugar mills are required by law to

pay growers a "fair and remunerative" or a<br>"state advised" price within 14 days of pur-<br>chase. But implementation can be difficult,<br>and private trade may choose to not buy.<br>The other traditional option is for government agencies to buy the entire mar-<br>ketable produce offered at MSP. But that is

physically and fiscally unsustainable.<br>There is a third option: price deficiency<br>payments (PDP). The government does not<br>physically buy or stock any crop; it simply<br>pays farmers the difference between the<br>market price and the crop the farmer sells to the private trade.<br>MADHYA PRADESH: PDP was tried out

MAJDHYA PIADLESH: PDP was the dout<br>first in Madhya Pradesh through its<br>Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana. The market price<br>for a crop under this scheme was its average<br>modal (most-quoted) rate in the Agricultural<br>Produce Market Com

ing states during the month of sale.<br>The price difference vis-à-vis the MSP<br>was payable on the actual quantity sold by<br>the farmer, backed by an *anubandh patra* (sale agreement with trader), tol parchi (weighment slip), and bhugtan patra (payent letter signed by both parties).
