LAST WEEKEND, PARTS of North India witnessed heavy rains that triggered flash floods and left a trail of destruction. Homes were flooded, roads and bridges washed away and communication networks disrupted, isolating communities and hampering rescue efforts. At least 50 deaths were reported. The rains triggered landslides which caused more damage. Himachal Pradesh was the worst affected. Several places in Haryana, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh reported record rainfall between Saturday and Sunday.

What caused the downpour? Three main factors can trigger such heavy rains in the region and the Himalaya. First, an active monsoon with strong winds in the lower air layers, bringing moisture into the region from the Bay of Bengal or the Arabian Sea. Second, a large-scale atmospheric forcing in the form of outflows in the upper layers of the atmosphere moving eastward through midlatitude troughs. These troughs can also direct the flow of moisture towards the Himalaya. Third, deep convection triggered by orographic uplift combined with the steep terrain of the Himalaya.

All these ingredients were present last weekend. The synoptic conditions were conducive to heavy rainfall. The monsoon was active with strong moist easterly winds entering the region and an eastward moving mid-latitude trough in the atmosphere's upper layers. There was also moisture intrusion from the North Arabian Sea. The floods in Uttarakhand in 2013 were caused by similar synoptic conditions. Another good example is the 2010 floods in Pakistan.

Before discussing the possible role of climate change, we need to understand the basic characteristics of monsoon rainfall in this region. We know that it does not rain every 365 days of the year. When it rains in a day, it does not rain every 24 hours. How many hours does it rain during the monsoon season? In this region, all the seasonal rainfall (about 80-100 cm) falls in 130-150 hours - a small part of the season. Half of the seasonal rainfall (40-

Warmer temperatures lead to increased evaporation, which, in turn, leads to more moisture in the atmosphere. This extra moisture leads to heavy rainfall when weather systems coincide with the unique geography of the region. Changes in land use and land cover also appear to be reasons for the increase in extreme monsoon rainfall. especially its intensity. The IPCC's scenarios for climate change indicate that these trends will continue. Multiday flood events are projected to increase faster than single-day events in the future â€” this can have severe consequences.

 $50 \text{ cm}$ ) falls in only 30-40 hours. The region experiences light and moderate rainfall in the other half of the season. This pattern suggests that periods of heavy rain contribute to the seasonal total. When these heavy rains occur, most of the rainwater drains away as runoff, especially when the soil is wet.

Recent studies show an increasing trend in extreme rainfall in many parts of the country, especially central India. The number of extreme rainfall events (more than 15 cm in 24 hours) has tripled in the region. The duration of rainstorms over central India has also tripled. The observations also indicate that during the monsoon, the total number of rainy days and rainy hours decreases. This indicates that when it rains, it rains very heavily. The Himalayan region, with its complex topography and varied weather patterns, is prone to extreme rainfall events. A recent study shows that 65 per cent of areas in the region have a positive trend in the frequency of daily rainfall extremes. Another study on the 2013 floods in Uttarakhand identified this region as one where deep, intense convective clouds are most likely to form. Instances of such deep convection have increased over time. Climate change is thought to be one of the main causes of this. Warmer temperatures lead to increased evaporation, which, in turn, leads to more moisture in the atmosphere. This extra moisture leads to heavy rainfall when weather systems coincide with the unique geography of the region. Changes in land use and land cover also appear to be reasons for the increase in extreme monsoon rainfall, especially its intensity. The IPCC's scenarios for climate change indicate that these trends will continue. Multi-day flood events are projected to increase faster than singleday events in the future  $-$  this can have severe consequences.

We know that the Arctic is warming and sea ice is receding due to human influence. There is growing evidence of the impact of Arctic warming on the monsoon climate mid-latitude circulation through

Observations and models suggest that due to Arctic warming, the frequency of occurrence of blocking highs and deep mid-latitude troughs (like the one last weekend) is likely to increase.

Extreme rainfall events like the one last weekend can occur anywhere in India during the monsoon season. To mitigate floods, we need a multi-pronged approach that includes both proactive measures and reactive strategies. These include: One, a robust early warning system that alerts people about heavy rains and possible flash floods. This system can include meteorological observations including a Doppler weather radar (DWR) and a highresolution numerical weather prediction model. Advanced methods such as AI/ML could be used to interpret the DWR and model forecast data. Two, continuous monitoring of rainfall patterns, river levels and an advanced flood warning system. Three, flood risk maps that take into account factors such as topography, historical flood data and hydrological modelling to assess vulnerability, identify high-risk zones and target actions. Four, improving and maintaining climate-resilient infrastructure, such as drainage systems and channels to prevent waterlogging. Five, proper implementation of land use planning and zoning regulations. For example, areas prone to flash floods can be designated as non-residential or restricted areas. Six, the protection and restoration of natural ecosystems, such as forests and wetlands. Vegetation acts as a natural buffer, absorbing rainfall and reducing runoff. Seven, awareness campaigns can influence people to take the right actions during floods, including arranging evacuation. providing first aid and getting information from reliable sources.

By recognising the increasing threat of extreme precipitation and implementing proactive measures, India can improve its resilience to extreme weather events
