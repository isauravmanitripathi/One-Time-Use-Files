## EXPRESS NEWS SERVICE

NEW DELHI, SEPTEMBER 14

THE SUPREME Court on Thursday announced the onboarding of its case data on the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG), the national repository of data on cases instituted, pending, and disposed of by courts around the country.

Chief Justice of India (CJI) D Y Chandrachud said: "It is a historic day... [The NIDG] is a unique and informative platform... Now at the click of a button vou can see real time information on pendency and disposal of cases, year-wise, total pendency of registered and unregistered cases, number of cases decided quorum-wise."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on X: "Laudatory step by the Supreme Court and CJI D Y Chandrachud Ji. Such harnessing of technology will further transparency and enhance the justice delivery system in our country."

## The data grid

The NIDG is a database of orders. judgments and case details of 18,735 District & Subordinate Courts and High Courts, created as an online platform under the eCourts Project. The data are updated in real time, and the grid contains granular data up to the Taluka level.

The NIDG was built as part of phase II of the centrally sponsored e-Courts project. Computerised data from more than 18,735 courts across the country are integrated with the NJDG. The platform has been developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) in close coordination with the in-house software development team of the Computer Cell, Registry of the Supreme Court, with an interactive inter-

face and analytics dashboard. Currently, litigants can access case status information on 23.81 crore cases, and more than 23.02 crore orders/judgments.

## How this helps

NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage, and reduce the pendency of cases. For instance, in 2023, the total pendency of registered cases in the SC is 64,854; however, last month, 5,412 cases were instituted, and 5,033 were disposed of. What this suggests is that pendency in the SC is largely due to legacy cases, since the court is currently disposing of approximately the same number of cases as are filed on an annual basis.

The data also help identify specific bottlenecks in judicial processes. So, if the data show land disputes in a particular state rising, they can serve as a cue for policymakers to investigate whether a particular law or set of laws need strengthening.

The data also help generate inputs related to particular areas of law  $-$  for example, to track cases related to land disputes, the land records data of 26 states have been linked to the NJDG.
