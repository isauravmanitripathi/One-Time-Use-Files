AUSTRALIANS WILL vote in a referendum on October 14 to decide whether the country's indigenous peoples should be formally consulted in making laws.

The referendum question reads: "A Proposed Law: to alter the Constitution to recognise the First Peoples of Australia by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice. Do you approve this proposed alteration?"

A recent YouGov poll has found that the referendum is unlikely to pass.

#### The First Peoples

This expression, and the word 'Aboriginal', refers to the indigenous inhabitants of the continent – people who lived on the Australian mainland and surrounding islands for tens of thousands of years before the first Europeans arrived in the early 17th century.

### The referendum

The referendum asks whether a body called the indigenous "Voice to Parliament" should be set up to advise lawmakers on matters that impact the lives of the First Peoples. The aboriginals find no mention in Australia's 122-year-old Constitution.

Aboriginal people make up about 3.2% of Australia's population, and track below national averages on most socioeconomic measures. According to a government booklet containing information that would help people make the choice on whether to support or to reject the

vote, indigenous Australians have:

A life expectancy 8 years shorter than non-Indigenous Australians;

Worse rates of disease and infant mortality:

■ A suicide rate twice as high as non-Indigenous Australians.

#### A tough battle

Any constitutional alterations in Australia require a national referendum. Voting is compulsory for all adults.

For the referendum to be passed. more than 50 per cent of voters must vote in favour nationally, plus the majority of voters in the majority of Australian states.

The Labour Party of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has pushed strongly for a 'Yes' vote, and Minister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney has said the referendum is about "drawing a line on the poor outcomes from the long legacy of failed programmes and broken policies, and listening to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people".

However, opposition parties like the Liberal Party of Australia and the Nationals have opposed the referendum. The 'No' campaign has argued that details of the proposed body - such as the members it would include, their powers, etc. have not been made clear. There is also an argument that saying 'Yes' would amount to dividing Australian society on the lines of race.
