## INSOLVENCY AND BANKRUPTCY CODE Firms liquidated had just 5% assets, while realisation from resolutions only 32.84%

## **GEORGE MATHEW** MUMBAI NOVEMBER 28

INDICATING THE poor risk management practices of lenders, corporates which ended up in liquidation under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), reported just 5 per cent of assets under their fold against the claims made by various debtors. On the other hand, realisation by claimants from successful resolution plans was 32.84 per cent, showing a huge haircut on the part of claimants, including lenders.

Of 2,249 corporate debtors (CDs) which ended up with orders for liquidation as of September 2023, 187 had admitted claims of more than Rs 1,000 crore with an aggregate claim of Rs 843,000 crore. However, they had assets on the ground valued only at just Rs 43,000 crore, according to Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI).

"While liquidation remains the option which has shown the maximum closures under IBC, its lower realisations is likely to encourage creditors to seek resolutions either outside the IBC or register only those cases under IBC where the recoveries through resolution are likely to be higher, said Soumyajit Niyogi, Director, India Ratings.

IBBI said the data as on September 2023 indicated that the creditors have realised Rs 3.16 lakh crore under the resolution plans approved under the Code. In addition, more than 26,000 applications having underlying default of Rs 9.33 lakh crore have been withdrawn before their admission to the resolution process.

The creditors have realised Rs 3.16 lakh crore under the resolution plans approved under the Code.

"This data primarily reflects the outcomes in terms of financial recovery. It is essential to recognize that the success of resolution goes beyond these recovery figures," IBBI said.

Meanwhile, recovery timelines under the resolution through the IBC route continue to lengthen with those resolved in  $Q2$  of  $FY24$ touching an all-time high of 662 days for financial creditors with a consistent increase across all creditor classes for the past three years. "Process-related challenges such as legal tussles between stake holders, case execution bandwidth, delay in judgments, information asymmetry and a lack of (valuation standardisation process) are leading to elongated timelines," India Ratings said.

Till September 2023, realisation by the claimants under resolution plans in comparison to liquidation value is 175.28 per cent. while the realisation by them in comparison to their claims is 32.84 per cent. "These realisations are exclusive of realisations that would arise from value of equity holdings post-resolution, resolution of PGs to CDs, and from disposal of applications for avoidance transactions," IBBI said.

Of the 808 CDs rescued under the Code as on September 30. 2023, the realisable value of the assets available with 138 CDs. when they entered the CIRP, was only Rs 1.64 lakh crore, though they owed Rs 8.78 lakh crore to the creditors. Realisation by the claimants under resolution plans in comparison to liquidation value is 175.28 per cent, while the realisation by them in comparison to their claims is 32.84 per cent till September 2023, IBBI said.

Till FY 2022-23, 682 CIRPs had vielded resolution plans with creditors realising Rs 2.88 lakh crore under the resolution plans. The liquidation value of the assets available with these CDs. when they entered the CIRP, was at Rs 1.73 lakh crore against the total claims of the creditors worth Rs 9.03 lakh crore.

The realisation to the creditors was 31.91 per cent and 166.49 per cent as against their admitted claims and liquidation value, respectively, IBBI said.

According to a report by the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, average sales have shown an increase of 76 per cent in three years since resolution of IBC cases. While the net margins continue to remain negative, the resolved firms have operationally broken even in the post-resolution period, which is a significant improvement from the pre-resolution period.

There is around 50 per cent increase in the average employee expenses in the three years postresolution-indicating a higher employment intensity in the resolved firms (listed) in the postresolution period. The total employment across firms have also shown a substantial increase in the post- resolution period. The trends indicate a significant increase of around 50 per cent in the average total assets of resolved firms post resolution, IIM said.

According to a former RBI official, banks are not conducting adequate contingency planning, especially for mitigating project risks. While on the one hand, the stress tests/ simulation models run by banks do not employ extreme stress scenarios, the extent to which the borrower can withstand it and the haircut to be imposed by banks in such cases.

On the other hand, they also do not factor in possible eventualities like failure of gas-based power projects to ensure supply of gas, failure to complete land acquisition for highway projects and failure to acquire environmental clearances. Banks definitely need to factor in such adverse situations and have a back-up/contingency plan in their appraisal process, he said.
