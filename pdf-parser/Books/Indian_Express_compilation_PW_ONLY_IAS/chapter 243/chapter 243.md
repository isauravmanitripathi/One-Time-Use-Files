# What was the Bommai judgment,<br>which the SC relied on in its ruling?

# APURVA VISHWANATH

NEW DELHI, DECEMBER 11

IN UPHOLDING the abrogation of Article 370, the Supreme Court on Monday relied heavily on its landmark 1994 judgement in SR Bommai v Union of India. What is this case, and how does it relate to the J&K challenge?

## The case

In Bommai, a nine-judge Bench of the Supreme Court interpreted Article 356 of the Constitution to define the contours of proclamation of President's rule. Article 356 contains provisions "in case of failure of constitutional machinery in States", including that for the imposition of President's rule.

While all nine judges upheld the provision, the Court ruled that the President's decision would be subject to judicial review. Bommai is still the settled law on when and how President's rule can be imposed, and was invoked in recent cases in Uttarakhand (2016) and Arunachal Pradesh (2016), both of which were overturned by the Supreme Court.

# The background

In 1989, the Centre dismissed the Janata Dal-led Karnataka government by imposing President's rule. After allegedly receiving 19 letters from MLAs withdrawing their support to Chief Minister SR Bommai's government, then Karnataka Governor PVenkatasubbaiah recommended to the President that he take over the state's administration.

He cited two reasons. First, that Bommai did not command a majority and, hence, "it was inappropriate under the Constitution" for him to continue. Second, no other party was in a position to form the government.

This move, however, was controversial. The SC ruling would later note that "the Governor did not ascertain the view of Shri Bommai" before making his report to the President. In fact, 7 out of the 19 legislators who allegedly withdrew support to the government would soon make a U-turn, complaining their signatures were obtained by misrepresentation.

## The verdict

The SC held that the President's proclamation can be subject to judicial review on grounds of illegality, mala fide, extraneous considerations, abuse of power, or fraud. While the President's appraisal of the issue cannot be examined, the Court said the material relied on for making the decision can be reviewed.

The verdict also made Parliamentary approval necessary for imposing President's rule. Only after the proclamation is approved by both Houses of Parliament can the President exercise the power. Till then, the President can only suspend the state legislature. If Parliament did not approve the proclamation within two months, the dismissed government would stand revived.

The ruling also drew a redline for Centre-

state relationships.

"The fact that under the scheme of our Constitution, greater power is conferred upon the Centre vis-Ã -vis the states does not mean that states are mere appendages of the Centre," Justice Jeevan Reddy wrote in his opinion. "The Centre cannot tamper with their powers. More particularly, the courts should not adopt an approach, an interpretation, which has the effect of or tends to have the effect of whittling down the powers reserved to the states," he wrote.

According to research by Alok Prasanna Kumar, Senior Resident Fellow at Vidhi Karnataka, the imposition of President's rule drastically decreased after the Bommai verdict. Between January 1950 and March 1994, President's Rule was imposed 100 times or an average of 2.5 times a year. Between 1995 and 2021, it has been imposed only 29 times or a little more than once a year.

## The Kashmir reference

A key question in the Kashmir case was whether Article 370 could have been abrogated when the state was under President's rule. Here, the Supreme Court relied on the Bommai ruling to hold that the actions of the President are constitutionally valid. The Court said that the Bommai ruling held that the actions taken by the President after issuing a Proclamation are subject to judicial review, but the judges adopted varying standards to test the validity of the executive orders.

The Court cited two  $-$  one by Justice PB Sawant, and another by Justice Reddy. Justice Sawant had set the standard of whether the exercise of power was mala fide or palpably irrational, while Justice Reddy observed that the advisability and necessity of the action must be borne in mind by the President.
