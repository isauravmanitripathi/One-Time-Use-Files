# EXPLAINED ECONOMICS How (and why) DBT works

Be it NREGA, PM-KISAN, or the Congress promise of NYAY, why do politicians rush to give direct benefits  $-\text{cash} - \text{to the poor? Traditional thinking suggests it is better to teach a man to fish rather than to}$ merely give him a fish to eat. But that may not always be the best choice, for politics or economics

#### LIDIT MISRA NEW DELHI, JANUARY 3

CONGRESS PRESIDENT Mallikarjun Kharge told an election rally on December 28 that if voted to power, the party would implement the NYAY scheme under which women would receive "at least Rs 60,000-70,000" annually.

NYAY, an acronym for Nyuntam Aay Yojana or Minimum Income Scheme, was the centrepiece of the Congress' 2019 Lok Sabha election manifesto. The party had promised a guaranteed annual payout of Rs 72,000 to the poorest 20% - roughly 5 crore families in the country under NYAY.

Before that, in 2018, the Narendra Modi government had rolled out the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) to provide "income support of 6,000 per year in three equal installments to all land holding farmer families". PM-KISAN was billed as the world's largest direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme for farmers.

Then, in 2023, the Congress government of Ashok Gehlot rolled out a scheme of minimum guaranteed income - not a minimum income guarantee - in Rajasthan.

#### Are schemes like NYAY and PM-KISAN the same as Universal Basic Income (UBI), the social welfare idea in which people unconditionally receive a fixed sum of money at pre-decided intervals?

Not quite. Under UBI, a government provides a "basic" income to every member of a population, from the richest to the poorest, regardless of whether they are employed or not. However, the government withdraws all subsidies - from food to fertilisers to train tickets to medical bills.

The idea is to give everyone a minimum income, cut the bureaucratic costs of running a large number of welfare programmes, and to tax everyone in a way that the UBI is funded. It is expected that the truly needy will get help, while anyone who doesn't actually need the UBI will find it taxed away.

The proposed NYAY and the existing PM-KISAN are different.

One, they are not accompanied by the removal of existing subsidies or benefits of other social welfare schemes for their beneficiaries

Two, the amount is much smaller than what can be considered a minimum or basic income needed to live a decent life.

Three, these schemes are targeted at specific groups of Indians; they are not universal.

# WHY ARE PEOPLE IN NEED?

#### Why has a UBI not been attempted in India, and is not popular elsewhere? As an idea, UBI has captured imaginations

### on both the left and the right of the economic ideological spectrum. But the hard fact is that no country can afford it.

In rich countries such as Switzerland, which considered and dropped the idea, the UBI amount would be quite a lot, even though the beneficiary population may be small. And in poorer countries, the amount would be smaller, but the population perhaps too large.

Also, cutting existing subsidies and raising taxes to fund the UBI would be politically unpopular ideas almost everywhere.

The Congress-led UPA government enacted laws to provide income support National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005) and subsidised food (National Food Security Act, 2013)

The Modi government, despite criticising the so-called politics of dole of the Congress, persisted with the schemes, and repeatedly used them to alleviate economic distress during the demonetisation episode and the Covid-19 pandemic, for example, PM-KISAN is a logical extension of NREGA and NFSA.

### What is the argument for direct benefit (or cash) transfers?

Traditional thinking on helping the poor is often captured in a well known saying: "If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day; if you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime."

However, what if this man is too hungry on the first day to learn anything  $-$  or so weal that he needs to be fed for a few days before he can summon enough strength to learn? What if the choice is between feeding him a fish today (and ensuring he lives for another day to learn fishing) and risking his life (and his ability to learn fishing tomorrow)?

Per cent of respondents answering

that poor people are poor because of

Perhaps the answer would be to give the man a fish before insisting he learns how to fish. This would be based on the realisation that (i) a feeble man can't learn much on an empty stomach and, (ii) the man would be motivated enough to learn provided he is in a situation to learn.

In 2010, social scientists Joseph Hanlon and development economists Armando Barrientos and David Hulme wrote a book called Just Give Money to the Poor: The Development Revolution from the Global South, which flagged the four paradigm shifts in thinking about the well-being of the poor and the vulnerable. Each of these stages built on the preceding stage.

■ In I6th-century England, the government for the first time accepted the responsibility for ensuring subsistence for all.

■ In late 19th-century Europe, government social spending increased, and pensions and sickness and old-age insurance were introduced.

■ In the mid-20th century, an adequate tandard of living became a human right and a government responsibility, and the rich North accepted a responsibility toward the poorer South.

■ At the beginning of the 21st century, countries of the Global South took the lead in construing cash transfers as a right, and in using them as a way to end poverty and promote development.

The authors argued that "simply giving money to the poor - no strings, no conditions, no kidding - may be the most promising approach not just for avoiding hardship and reducing poverty, but for long-term development as well." They gave examples from Mexico, South Africa, Namibia, Brazil, Indonesia, and India (NREGA) in support of their thesis.<br>Also, such transfers can create a virtuous

cycle of development, the book argued: Families with an assured, though small, income begin to take small risks by investing in their future: buying better seeds to try to increase farm production, purchasing goods that can be resold locally, or even spending more time looking for better jobs... When they have a bit of extra income, most families spend the money locally, buying food, clothing, and inputs. This stimulates the local economy, because local people sell more, earn more, and buy more from their neighbors, creating the rising spiral."

## What about fears that giving cash can make people lazy and dependent?

The table alongside, sourced from the book by Hanlon, Barrientos, and Hulme, shows that before the turn of the century, the majority of Indians surveyed felt that the poor were victims of an unfair society. It is possible that the majority no longer feels this way.

The authors write: "... You cannot pull yourself up by your bootstraps if you have no boots. And giving 'boots' to people with little money does not make them lazy or reluctant to work; rather, just the opposite happens. A small guaranteed income provides a foundation that enables people to transform their own lives. ...Many people are trapped in poverty because they have so little money that they cannot buy things they know they need, such as medicines or schoolbooks or food or fertilizer. They are in a hole with no way to climb out; cash transfers provide a ladder.

This also explains why DBT does not mean governments can forget about providing other services such as health care or education. In fact, developed countries too provide cash transfers, be it in the shape of child support. housing benefits, or winter fuel payments.
