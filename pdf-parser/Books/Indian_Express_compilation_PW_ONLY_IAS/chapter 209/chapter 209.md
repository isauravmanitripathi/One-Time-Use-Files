BANGKOK, NOVEMBER 21

THAILAND'S CABINET on Tuesday approved an amendment to its civil code to allow same-sex marriage, with an expectation for the draft to be submitted to Parliament next month.

Karom Polpornklang, a deputy government spokesperson, said the amendment to the Civil and Commercial Code will change the words "men and women" and "husband and wife" to "individuals" and "marriage partners" for same-sex couples to be able to receive the same rights that heterosexual couples receive.

He said the law would guarantee the right to form a family in a relationship between samesex couples, adding that the next step will be an amendment to the pension fund law to recognize same-sex couples as well.

Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin told reporters that the draft law is expected to be proposed to Parliament on Dec. 12. If it becomes law after Parliament's approval and King Maha Vajiralongkorn's endorsement, Thailand will be the third place in Asia, after Taiwan and Nepal, to allow same-sex marriage.

While famous for being LGBTQ+ friendly, Thailand has struggled to pass a marriage equality law. Parliament last year debated several amendments to allow either marriage equality or civil unions for same-sex couples. The new government which took office in August, revived attempts for a marriage equality bill, which it had promised in its campaign.
