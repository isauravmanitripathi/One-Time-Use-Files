# Vizhinjam port: latest row over mega project

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM OCTOBER 18

#### THERE IS fresh debate in Kerala over the under-construction Vizhinjam international seaport project, the country's first deep-water transshipment port.

On Sunday, the state accorded a grand reception to a vessel that brought a ship-toshore crane to the port. Docking of the heavy load carrier vessel is being seen as a milestone towards the operation-readiness of the much-delayed project. While the ruling CPI(M) and the Opposition Congress started a credit war over the project, senior BJP leader and MoS V Muraleedharan termed the reception for a "ship with construction material" a publicity stunt.

#### What is the project?

Located near Thiruvananthapuram, Vizhinjam is India's first international deepwater transhipment port. It has a natural depth of more than 18 meters, scalable up to 20 meters, which is crucial to get large vessels and mother ships. It is located 10 nautical miles from the international shipping route.

The Rs 7,600-crore project is being executed by Adani Ports and SEZ Private Limited.

Attempts to execute the project were made by successive regimes. Finally in 2015, the then Congress government inked a deal with the Adani Group. Of the total investment, the Adani Group would invest Rs 2,454 crore and another Rs 1.635 crore would be mobilised from the state and Centre.

#### Which vessel docked at Vizhinjam?

Hong Kong-flagged Zhenu Hua 15 docked at the seaport under construction. This is meant for moving cargo from ships to the shore. Seven more such cranes would be brought from China in the coming months.

### Why is a transshipment port needed?

India has 13 major ports. What it lacks is a land-side mega-port to deal with ultralarge container ships. Hence, nearly 75% of India's transshipment cargo is handled at ports like Colombo, Singapore, and Klang.

Developing a port into a transshipment<br>hub will bring in benefits such as forex savings, foreign direct investment, development of related logistics infrastructure, employment generation, and increase in revenue share.

#### Why was the project delayed?

The Adani group in 2015 promised that the project would be ready in 1,000 days. However, it missed deadlines several times since 2019, mainly due to the delay in the construction of a breakwater.

The 2017 Ockhi cyclone, the Covid-19 andemic, acute shortage of granite boulders to build the 3.1-km breakwater, and last year's fishermen protest against the project contributed to the delay.
