## A grim future

Over the years, several studies have in-<br>dicated that with rising global temperatures,<br>the Amazon will experience longer and more frequent droughts. A 2022 study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said if humans continue burning fossil fuels at the current rate, the rainforest would experience major<br>drought nine out of every 10 years by 2060.

Elena Shevliakova, a scientist at<br>the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric<br>Administration, told Scientific American that<br>the rainforest might appear like a distant<br>world, to its fate.
