ADITYA L1, India's first mission to study the Sun, is inching closer to its destination, and would be injected into its final orbit on January 6 evening

The spacecraft, launched on September 2, would get into what is known as a 'halo orbit' around the Lagrange Point 1 (L1), one of the five spots in the moving Sun-Earth system, where the gravitational effects of the two bodies roughly balance each other.

These five spots are relatively

stationary to the Earth and Sun. and offer a somewhat stable location for a spacecraft to view the Sun. The L1 point is about 1.5 million kilometres from the Earth. This is just 1 per cent of the total distance between the Earth and Sun.

"Aditya L1 has already reached the L1 point and the manoeuvre (on January 6) will put it in the desired orbit. Without getting into the orbit, the spacecraft will continue to travel towards the Sun," an ISRO official said.

Though the L1, like the other Lagrange points, is a relatively stable position, it is difficult to keep the spacecraft firmly fixed at that location. It is much better to get into an orbit around this point, called 'halo orbit'. Moving into this three-dimensional orbit also offers the spacecraft an opportunity to view the Sun from different angles.

'Aditya L1 will make it to a halo orbit around the L1 point. As the Earth moves around the Sun, the L1 point will also move. So does the halo orbit,' Annapurni Subramaniam, director, Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bengaluru, told The Indian Express.

Getting into this orbit is quite challenging, and it is the first time that ISRO is attempting such a manoeuvre.
