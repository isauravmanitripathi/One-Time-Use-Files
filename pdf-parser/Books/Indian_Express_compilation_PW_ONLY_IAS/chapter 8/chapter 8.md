AS A PART of its hallmark campaign "Culture Unites All", the Culture Working Group (CWG) under India's G20 Presidency set a Guinness World Record for "the largest display of Lambani items". Nearly 450 women craftspersons created over 1,755 Lambani embroidered patches that formed a beautiful art installation in the Yeduru Basavanna complex close to the famous Virunaksha temple in Hampi, the capital of the 14th century Vijayanagara kingdom on the banks of the Tungabhadra.

This record aligns with the third priority articulated by the CWG of India's G20 Presidency, "Promotion of Cultural and Creative Industries and Creative Economy", which is an essential part of our global economy, impacting our social and cultural fabric.

'Culture Unites All" campaign The launched during the first G20 CWG meet ing in Khajuraho is a call for action to celebrate the commonalities across the myriad cultures of the world that are distinct yet so connected. A promising initiative, it advocates for cultural diversity as a strength to be valued and a magnetic force holding societies together.

This record as a part of the campaign, aims to spotlight locally known traditional arts and crafts such as Lambani embroidery on the global stage. It helps to support local economies as well as encourage their continuity by expanding opportunities for artisans. The exquisite embroidery tradition that thrives in numerous villages across the region is also a recipient of the Geographical Indication (GI) tag.

This intangible cultural heritage element, practised and led by women of the Lambani community, serves as a significant source of livelihood and sustenance for the community. The uniqueness of this craft lies in the process of piecing together patches of discarded fabric through intricate stitching patterns, which are embellished manually. The Lambani patchwork embroidery exemplifies the many traditional sustainable living heritage practices of India and strongly resonates with the "Culture for LiFE" initiative of the G20 CWG of India, promoting an environmentally conscious lifestyle and concerted action towards sustainability.

It is noteworthy that the techniques and

aesthetic sensibilities of the embroidery traditions of the Lambanis recur across Eastern Furone West Asia and Central Asia This is only logical given the historical movement of the nomadic communities across boundaries creating artistic linkages. Just as a patchwork quilt brings together disparate pieces of fabric into a beautiful whole, this world record strives to highlight our shared global heritage and the peaceful co-existence among diverse cultures and communities.

The CWG under India's G20 presidency recognises that cultural and creative collaborations can facilitate innovative solutions to complex global issues pertaining to climate change, health, economic growth and more. Therefore, "Culture Unites All" is an attempt to uncover a tapestry of shared heritage, mutual respect, and the immense potential for cultural exchange to foster inclusivity, harmony, and sustainable development.

The creative sector is not only a major contributor to national and international economies, but it also profoundly influences social ecosystems, strengthens cultural identities, and fosters freedom of expression and cross-cultural dialogue. Regional embroidery traditions - kantha, kashida, phulkari, chikankari etc. - are vibrant facets of India's creative economy. As repositories of centuries-old cultural expressions, these traditions not only fulfil social and economic needs but also narrate stories of our collective wisdom.

Cultural experiences consciously curated under this campaign enable empathy, deepen understanding, and promote peace. Be it the effervescent sandart displayed during the second CWG meeting in Bhubaneswar, or the Lambani Guinness World Record initiative in Hampi, the aim is to raise awareness and appreciate the dynamic artistic expressions of humanity.

As we move forward to the fourth CWG meeting culminating in the Culture Ministers' Meet scheduled in August at Varanasi, India aims to harness the potential of the "Culture Unites All" campaign as a catalvst for building consensus and attaining tangible outcomes.
