NEW DEL HI. OCTOBER 5

ON WEDNESDAY, the Union cabinet approved a tribal university for Telangana the Sarakka Central Tribal University. which will come up in Mulugu district at a cost of Rs 889 crore.

Though the university was a commitment made by the Centre as a part of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, in Telangana, it faced challenges as land allocation of 500-600 acres could not be done in time. During his visit to the pollbound state recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the university would be named after Sammakka-Sarakka - a mother-daughter duo revered by the local tribal community.

### The legend

Sammakka is said to have been married to Pagididda Raju, a feudal chief of the Kakatiyas, a dynasty which ruled the Warangal area. She had two daughters and one son - Sarakka or Saralamma. Nagulamma and Jampanna, respectively.

In the 13th century, during a battle to protest taxes imposed on the Koya people, Saralamma died. Sammakka disappeared into the hills and local tribals believed she metamorphosed into a vermillion casket.

To commemorate the mother-daughter, Mulugu holds a biennial festival - the Sammakka Saralamma Jatara - considered among the largest gatherings of tribal people in the world. The Jatara or pilgrimage begins at Medaram village and the rituals are conducted by Koya priests.

Until 1955, about 2,000 people used to visit Medaram, mostly the Koyas. But slowly, it has assumed the form of a large Hindu religious festival, so much so that it is believed that after Kumbha Mela, the Sammakka Saralamma Jatara attracts the largest number of devotees in the country.
