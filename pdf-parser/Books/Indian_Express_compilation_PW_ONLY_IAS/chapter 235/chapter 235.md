# Behind unseasonal rain & lightning strikes in Gujarat

## RITU SHARMA AND SOHINI GHOSH AHMEDABAD, NOVEMBER 28

UNSEASONAL HEAVY rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms, hailstorms and lightning strikes claimed 27 lives in Gujarat by Monday.

While weather officials said enough warning was given about the lightning strikes, the disaster management system is designed more for earthquakes and heavy rainfall, not as much for lightning - which annually contribute to many deaths across India.

### What explains the weather events?

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has attributed the rain and the lightning flashes to three weather systems - cy clonic circulation over the Northeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Saurashtra and Kutch, Western Disturbances, and easterly trough. Western Disturbances are storms that orig-

inate over the Mediterranean Sea region and may bring rainfall to northwestern India in the winter. On the other hand, easterly winds flow from the east in the equatorial region throughout the year.

Manorama Mohanty, IMD regional director, told The Indian Express, "Sunday's weather phenomenon was due to the three systems of Western Disturbances over

Pakistan, induced cyclonic circulation over Pakistan and Rajasthan, and upper air trough in easterlies from Southwest Arabian Sea to Northeast Arab-

ian Sea." She added that the development of three simultaneous systems is not uncommon.

Atul Kumar Varma, group director of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences and Applications Group, at ISRO's Space Applications Centre (SAC) in Ahmedabad, said. "In this season, we have Western Disturbances passing over the northern part every year generally, descending towards the lower latitudes. This usually brings snowfall over the Himalayan region. But sometimes, when the strength (of these disturbances) is more, it may bring rainfall in southern latitude areas, say Gujarat or Madhya Pradesh. This time, it was a passing Western Disturbance, moving from west to east, form-

ing somewhere near the Mediterranean Sea. The disturbance has passed over the Gujarat region and is now over Madhya Pradesh."

## Why the lightning strikes?

According to Mohanty, there are two reaons for lightning strikes. She said, "Whenever there is an interaction between any sys tem and Western Disturbances, it leads to lightning. Also, the first spell of activity after a long dry period leads to convective activity, which results in lightning." This was the

## case on Sunday.

Varma said that the thunderstorm can also be explained by the presence of more moisture interacting with the Western Disturbances this time.

#### Were warnings issued?

The Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority (GSDMA) was set up immediately after the 2001 earthquake. It was to act as a nodal agency to plan and implement pre-disaster preparedness and mitigation activities.

GSDMA CEO Anupam Anand told The Indian Express. "There are different pre-warning mechanisms in each district against heavy rainfall and earthquakes, and mechanisms to disseminate that too. Such a mechanism for lightning is not in place." Mohanty, however, said the IMD had issued a specific warning for lightning well in advance.
