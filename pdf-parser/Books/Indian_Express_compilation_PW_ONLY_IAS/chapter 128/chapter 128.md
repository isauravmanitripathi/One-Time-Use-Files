## SUPREME COURT DIRECTION ON SYL CANAL

## Punjab-Haryana ties hit troubled waters again

## VARINDER BHATIA CHANDIGARH, OCTOBER 6

THE SUTLEI-YAMUNA Link (SYL) canal issue is in focus again in Haryana and Punjab politics following the Supreme Court's direction on Wednesday ordering the government of Punjab to complete the construction of the project. This has strengthened the hand of the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BIP government in Haryana, placing a massive strain on the relationship between the neighbouring states.

Khattar on Friday called the AAP government in Punjab twofaced. The Harvana CM said: "Instead of finding an amicable solution to this issue, the Punjab government is shedding crocodile tears. The Supreme Court has given a three-month deadline to the central government to take possession of the land which has been acquired."

Parties in both states have stuck together for the "larger interests of the state". The Congress, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), Jannayak Janta Party (JIP), and BIP in Haryana are in favour of the canal's construction while the BIP, Congress, and AAP in Punjab oppose the project. Hardline Sikh group Dal Khalsa has warned that any attempt to construct the canal can potentially trigger a "rebellion in Punjab".

The SYL canal has been a flashpoint between Punjab and Haryana for decades now. Since 2002, the Supreme Court has been directing both the states

and the Union government to find an amicable solution to the dispute, underlining that the canal needs to be constructed. The construction of the canal in Haryana's jurisdiction has been completed and the top court has now asked Punjab to assess the work done so far and expedite it.

The court on Wednesday asked the Union government to "survey the portion of the land allocated for the project in Punjab to ensure that the land is protected ... " and find out "how much has been made and what has been made".

Since then, both states have hardened their position. After a Cabinet meeting on Thursday, Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann said "not even a single drop" of additional water would be shared with any state. A legal route would be explored, he added.

With the court issuing directions to the Union government, the pressure is now on it to navigate the situation. In Haryana, the BIP's alliance with the IIP is under strain and it cannot afford to go soft on the water issue as it cannot afford any adverse electoral impact in a state where it has won all 10 parliamentary seats the last two elections. In Punjab, the party holds just two of the state's 13 Lok Sabha seats and is trying to find its footing.

After the Ajay Chautala-led INLD attempted to dig the Punjab portion of the SYL canal in February 2017, a major clash between the people of the two states was averted because of caution exercised by the police.

Subsequently, multiple rounds of talks between Punjab and Haryana CMs, a few even in the presence of Union Ministers. were held but a breakthrough proved elusive. Ever since Mann assumed power last year, he has been maintaining that Punjab has no surplus water to share with its neighbour.
