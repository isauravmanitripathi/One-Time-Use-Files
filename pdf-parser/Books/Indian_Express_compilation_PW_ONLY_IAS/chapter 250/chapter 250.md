It holds out lessons in resilience. India should strengthen ties with it to reap opportunities and enlarge regional influence

ALL HISTORY IS a travelogue of time 'Main samay hoon" (I am time) was the famous opening line of Mahabharat, the TV serial that took the nation by storm in the late 1980s - the line encapsulated the eternal message of the great Indian epic. It showed that time is both a teacher and healer. Time's healing power is truth which triumphs over the arrogance o alsehood. Justice struggles incessantly against injustice, and emerges victorious War submits to peace. Construction folows destruction, and reconciliation replaces rancour.

When that happens, battlefields make way for schools, universities, hi-tech industries, verdant rice fields, sports stadiums, bustling markets, and enchanting tourist resorts. Come to Vietnam to see<br>how history heals and rejuvenates.

The brave and freedom-loving Vietnamese first fought against French colonial rule (1887 to 1954). The French justified their imperialism by claiming they were on a "civilising mission". In the first Indochina War from 1946 and 1954 they killed nearly 200,000 Vietnamese,<br>but eventually left after a shattering rout at the Dien Bien Phu airbase.

Then came the mighty Americans, only to suffer a humiliating defeat after 20 years. They justified their war by claiming it was necessary to turn back the "tide o communism" in Asia. Nearly five million<br>Vietnamese were killed, four-fifths of them civilians. Over 58,000 American soldiers too perished, and their names are inscribed in the Vietnam Veterans Memoria in Washington, D.C. The US dropped three times as many tonnes of bombs on Vietnam as the Allies dropped in all of WW II. We Indians must not forget that French and American bombs destroyed many ex quisite Hindu temples built by Champ rings between the 4th and 14th centurie in central Vietnam. Between 1961-71, the US sprayed 13 million gallons of Agent Orange, a deadly chemical weapon on forests and farmland. This caused cancer and birth defects on a shocking scale. which can be seen even today.

To know the horrors committed by the US military, visit the War Remnants<br>Museum in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon). To see the incredible bravery and ingeniousness of Vietnamese guerillas come to Cu Chi Tunnels in a forest on the city's outskirts. Here, they have dug a 240 mile-long labyrinth of underground trenches in three layers, complete with military barracks, hospitals, conference halls, and dining rooms.<br>In February 1979, Vietnam had to

fight another brief war when China<br>launched an attack to "teach" its southern neighbour a lesson. The war ended after a month, with China with-

## drawing its troops.

Today, Vietnam is a miraculously transformed nation. With the realisation of its two major goals - independence (from colonial rule) and unity (reunifica ion of the northern and southern parts of the country)  $-$  the memory of wars has been cleansed of all bitterness towards the aggressors. Vietnam now enjoys friendly relations with both the US and China.<br>"How do Vietnamese see their history

of wars?" I asked Ton Sinh Thanh, who served as Vietnam's ambassador to India, in Hanoi. In words that carried the wis dom of Buddhism, the main religion of<br>Vietnam, he replied, "We haven't forgotten anything, but forgiven everything. We do not want to remain obsessed with the past. We are now more focused on build ing a bright future for our Fatherland, for which we need peace and development.

Vietnam knows that peace with neighbours and cooperation with all is indispensable for creating a future of happi-<br>ness for its people. "If the country is<br>independent but its people don't have happiness and freedom, then independence is meaningless". These sage words of Ho Chi Minh, the father of the nation, serve as the guiding principle for the ruling communist party and its government.<br>To secure peace, in 2019, it wisely

adopted a defence policy of "Four Nos" No to joining any military alliance; no to siding with one country to counter another; no to foreign military bases or use of Vietnam's territory to counter a third country; and no to use of or threat of force in international relations.

Vietnam embarked on economic reforms (called 'Doi Moi') in 1986. The re sults have been spectacular. Per capita in come has gone up from \$100 in the 1980s to \$4,300 in 2023, which is 16 per cent higher than India's. Exports have soared from \$2 bn in 2001 to 375 bn now. The poverty rate has dipped below 3 per cent.

However, several well-placed Vietnamese I spoke to have a grievance<br>towards New Delhi. They politely said that India does not pay enough attention to expanding trade and business relations with a resurgent Vietnam. The grievance is valid. India is resisting a Free Trade Agreement with Vietnam, which can boost bilateral trade from \$15 bn to over \$50 bn in five years (Vietnam-China trade has surged from \$2.4 bn in 2000 to more than \$175 bn in 2022). For over a year now, Vietnam's Prime Minister has been wanting to visit India. But New Delhi hasn't responded.

Ambassador Thanh summed it up well. "Our two countries enjoy the best of political relations. We have never had any conflict, either in history or in modern times. The people and government of Vietnam are very happy that India is rising as a major power in Asia and the world. Yet, New Delhi seems more comfortable looking west than east. If it wants to reap the enormous opportunities Vietnam provides - and also if it wants to enlarge its influence in the wider Indo-China and ASEAN region - India should not only Act East, but also Act Fast."
