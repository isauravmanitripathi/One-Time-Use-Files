In its petition, the state said the Governor "has positioned himself as a political rival to the legitimately elected" TN government and asserted that the Governor's actions should not be driven by personal discretion but must reflect "the satisfaction of the Council of Ministers on whose aid and advice the President or the Governor generally exercises all his powers and functions". Hearing the petition that claimed the Governor's action was "resulting in a nearstandstill of administrative operations," the SC said he cannot sit on key Bills passed by the legislature.
