# **Armed ForCes**

The border of our country is defended, and its protection is ensured by the President of India with the help of the Supreme command of the Indian Armed Forces under his or her control. The proper policy framework and legislation regarding the armed forces are the responsibility of the Defence Ministry, and it is the most important responsibility of the ministry. The defence comprises the Department of Defence, Department of Defence Production, Department of Defence Research and Development and the Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare. The defence secretary heads the Department of Defence and aids the ministry in its activities. Armed forces comprise the Army, Navy and the Air Force. Each of the armed force works under a Commander-in-Chief with their own designation.

# **Indian Army**

The Indian Army came into being since we gained independence from the British. Head quartered in the National Capital Region of New Delhi, it is placed under the Chief of the Army Staff, designated General, who takes command and control of the whole system of administration of the Indian Army. The Indian Army has a system of regiments, which is subdivided on the basis of operation and geographical locations. It is subdivided as six commands in operation and one training command. Each of the command is put under a Lieutenant General who ranks equivalent to Vice-chief of the Army Staff.

The Indian Army comprises almost 80% of all active personnel of defence of India, and is one of the largest standing armies in the world. The only mandate of the Indian Army is to look after the country's borders from external aggression and sometimes internal rebellion. It also performs many peace-keeping operations from across the world to many friendly nations and also provides humanitarian assistance and relief works for disasters and offers help to civil authorities.

# **Indian Navy**

The Indian Navy which has its headquarters in New Delhi is placed under the Defence Ministry that protects the maritime boundary of India, which is headed by the Chief of the Indian Navy, who is designated the Admiral. Before India became republic, the Indian Navy was called the Royal Indian Navy, and then the word 'Royal' was removed on the day India attained republic status. The Indian Navy similar to the Army plays a wide range of roles from humanitarian assistance to combating in battles. The Indian Navy has three areas of command in all three coastal borders, namely the western, southern and the eastern naval commands in Mumbai, Kochi and Vizag, respectively, whereas every naval command is headed by a Flag Officer. The Indian Navy has four distinct roles:

#### *The military role*

The military role involves the use of power or force over enemies who threaten the national security in the maritime border.

# *The diplomatic role*

Naval diplomacy involves the effective use of the Indian Navy in favour of protecting foreign policy objectives and strengthening international relations to warn off enemies.

#### *Constabulary role*

Though the use of force is the last resort for any action, the prime importance of the Indian Navy is to protect the Maritime Zones of India (MZI) through Low-intensity Maritime Operations (LIMO), which is the constabulary role. This is to ensure that law and order in the maritime zones is under control and to protect harbours and ports on the Indian coast.

# *Benign role*

The Indian Navy offers various humanitarian assistance programmes, search and rescue programmes, disposal of ordinances, etc. And because of its speedy operations, the Navy plays a significant role in situations of crisis by helping with relief materials and first aid.

# **Indian Air Force**

The Indian Air Force, also headquartered in New Delhi, protects the Indian air space. It was established in 1932 and is headed by the Air Chief Marshall, who holds a four-star rank. Over the years, the Indian Air Force has undergone many changes in its structure and composition, the most prominent of which is the induction of women to the IAF through short service commissions. It has seven commands under its control, namely the western, eastern, central, southwestern, southern, training and maintenance commands each headed by an Air Officer. The IAF also performs various roles ranging from military to benign roles. It also performs UN peace-keeping operations in Somalia, Sierra Leone, Sudan and Congo.

# **Central Armed Police Forces**

The Central Armed Police Force is a set of or a combination of seven police forces which includes Assam Rifles, Border Security Force, Central Industrial Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, Indo-Tibetan Border Police, National Security Guard and the Sashastra Seema Bal. The CAPF works under the Ministry Of Home Affairs of the Indian Government.

# **Assam Rifles**

The Assam Rifles is the oldest of all the central paramilitary forces and was originally set up to protect the fertile regions of Assam from uncontrollable tribes. It was referred to as Cachar Levy in the olden days, which was later renamed as Assam Rifles, headquartered in Shillong. Earlier it was under the control of the Ministry of External Affairs but was later changed to be under the control of the Ministry of Home Affairs post 1965. During the 1965 Indo-Pakistan disputes, Assam Rifles played a key role in guarding the northeastern parts of the country while the Army was under its command in the west.

They are affectionately called the Friends of the Hill people because Assam Rifles have participated in many developmental activities of the northeast people and were also involved in many humanitarian relief works. Hence, it is also proudly acclaimed as the Sentinels of the North East. It has participated in many counter-insurgency operations and has also played a vital role in ensuring peace in the Indo-China and the Indo-Myanmar borders.

# **Border Security Force**

The BSF, their motto being 'Duty Unto Death', is one of the paramilitary forces that guard India's land border. It is the largest border-guarding force in the world and is one of the law enforcement agencies under the Home Ministry. The Border Security Force came into force in 1965 replacing the state armed police who were guarding the Indo-Pakistan Border. It played a major role in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.

It performs two types of tasks: peace-time and war-time operations. Peacetime operations include the promotion of secured feeling among the border area population and the prevention of trans-border crimes and illegal activities. Being one of the finest fighting forces its war-time operations include the protection of establishments of the army, provide escorts and protect few prisons. It also plays roles such as other UN peace-keeping missions and many other benign roles.

#### **The Central Industrial Security Force**

The Central Industrial Security Force is a multi-skilled security agency that came into force in 1969 through an act of parliament, which has its headquarters in Delhi. It provides security to all public sector undertaking companies. It has five wings and is divided into seven sectors: the airport sector, north sector, northeast sector, eastern sector, western sector, southern sector and the training sector.

It provides security to government properties and establishments and prevents and controls illegal activities. It also provides security to the employees of government installations. The unique quality of the CISF is the fire wing that protects civilians from fire hazards, and it has specialised and trained force for it.

#### **Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF)**

The CRPF Act that passed in 1949 helped in the creation of the Central Reserve Police Force, a formidable police force of the Indian Union, which protects the internal security of the nation. It is considered to be the most acceptable police force by the people as well as state governments as it works in complete partnership with the police force of the state. Its position in the society is not very visible but it plays a very important role adapting to any kind of situation. Since the merger of Princely states to the recent elections till date, the role of the CRPF is crucial in its Pan India Character.

The role of the CRPF includes controlling of riots; counter-insurgency operations; operations against Maoists; co-ordination of security during elections; protecting VIPs, democratic establishments and democratic set ups; response during disasters, peace-keeping missions by the UN and protecting the environment and preventing its degradation. It does not deal with only law and order problems, but also with many problems like those mentioned above.

#### **Indo-Tibetan Border Police**

Originally brought under the CRPF Act in 1962, but later in 1992, the parliament of India enacted a separate Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force (ITBPF) Act and provided a proper framework for it. This force is a border-guarding force that guards the Himalayan borders of India from the Ladakh region to Arunachal Pradesh. The force guards in the Himalayan region are exposed to very cold climate and often face avalanches, landslides and blizzards.

So the personnel in the force are trained mountaineers and skiers. They are the first force to respond in case of disasters in high altitude regions. They are affectionately called by the people as the HIMVEERS. Apart from this they also perform peace-keeping missions and prevent trans-border crimes and illegal migrations. They also provide security to people who come for pilgrimage to temples. They are a multi-dimensional force.

#### **National Security Guard**

The National Security Guard, another unit under the Home Ministry, was formed as a result of the assassination of the former Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi. It was set up in 1984 as a unit that would deal with internal security problems. It functions similar to GSG-9 and SAS of Germany and United Kingdom, respectively. Because of the colour of the uniform that the personnel wear, they are popularly referred to as Black Cats. They comprise the Special Action Group and Special Ranger Group who perform various operations under the higher command.

The most important role is to fight terror-related activities and help the state police forces. The Special Action Group is the Strike Wing, and the personnel are inducted from the army. The Special Ranger Group is widely employed to guard high-risk VIPs; the subgroup of this is the Special Protection Group who guards the most important people such as the Prime Minister of India, the Former Prime Minister, the President and their immediate family members.

#### **Sashastra Seema Bal**

The SSB, set up in 1963, during the Indo-China disputes, guards the Indian Border; hence, it is a border-guarding force and it also serves as a Lead Intelligence Agency under the Ministry of Home Affairs in the Indian Government. It served to promote a feeling of connection to people in the border areas by motivating them, training them and providing them with a number of welfare programs in the Indo-Pakistan, Indo-Nepal, Indo-Bhutan and Indo-China borders.

It plays a key role in preventing trans-border crimes and illegal activities such as smuggling and also stops the entry or exit of people without proper approval. It also helps in playing a benign role among the border area people.

# **PARAMILITARY FORCES**

The paramilitary force has never had its definition yet in any of the government documents, but the reference is used conventionally. It is referred as the Indian coast guard, home guard and the railway protection force.

# **Indian Coast Guard**

The Indian Coast Guard came into existence as a result of the enactment of the Coast Guard Act in 1978, which was recommended by the Rustomji Committee that looked into the continuous smuggling activities in the coastal border. It works under the Defence Ministry with the motto of Vayam Rakshamah, meaning "we protect". It is operated through five regions, namely the western, eastern, northeastern, northwestern and the Andaman and Nicobar regions with each headed by the Inspector General.

The most important roles of the Indian Coast Guard are to ensure the safety of the coastal islands and to protect the fishermen community and the marine environment, both floral and faunal species. It also works as a law enforcement agency in territorial and international waters. The most important duty of all is the prevention of smuggling and other illegal activities that occur through the coastal waters.

# **Home Guard**

These are forces who came in voluntarily to help the police forces in communal riots in 1946, forming in almost all the border states and also in a few other states. After the outburst of the Indo-China conflict, the central government ordered all the home guards to join as one single unit as Home Guards in 1962. These forces are mostly involved in the defence of civilians and the protection of minority sections during communal riots.

It performs a variety of functions like the subsidiary to the state police in various relief measures during disasters, provides many essential services like nursing, transport, fire services and serves many other communication purposes. Sometimes, these forces also fights in wars when needed. In total there are 18 commands now in states like Assam, Gujarat, Meghalaya, Punjab, West Bengal and Rajasthan.

# **Railway Protection Force**

Forces to protect railway amenities have been in existence since the midnineteenth century, but the proper framework was given through the Railway Protection Force Act in 1957. It works under the Ministry of Railways, which serves to ensure the safety of the passenger and the protect railway amenities.

A few of the roles include combat against criminals in passenger protection, security against anti-social elements, prevention of women and children trafficking and playing a bridging role between the government-appointed railway police and administration.

# **Central Intelligence and Investigating Agencies**

![](_page_6_Figure_2.jpeg)

# **National Investigation Agency (NIA)**

The National Investigation Agency was brought into force through the National Investigation Agency Act, 2008 by the Indian parliament to investigate the outbreak of the Mumbai terror attacks. The NIA works under the Ministry of Home Affairs. It is of international standards, excels in counter-terrorism operations and has very well-trained personnel. It is aimed at making out detailed terrorist-related information. It is exempted from the Right to Information Act, 2005.

Its role is to perform in-depth investigation on any offence using scientific methods by demonstrating scientific temper and excellent spirit while discharging duties. It helps in ensuring speedy trials and it has developed into a professional and highly qualified organisation that maintains the law of the land and the dignity of the individuals. It helps the government in any investigation against any terror-related cases.

# **Federal Questions Regarding NIA's Power**

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) was established in a concurrent jurisdiction framework, with provisions for taking up specific cases under specific laws. This means that the NIA would work along with state police departments and will only investigate cases that are pertaining to 8 particular laws, given below.

- 1. The Atomic Energy Act, 1962 (33 of 1962)
- 2. The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (37 of 1967)
- 3. The Anti-Hijacking Act, 1982 (65 of 1982)
- 4. The Suppression of Unlawful Acts against Safety of Civil Aviation Act, 1982 (66 of 1982)
- 5. The SAARC Convention (Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1993 (36 of 1993)
- 6. The Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against Safety of Maritime Navigation and Fixed Platforms on Continental Shelf Act, 2002 (69 of 2002)
- 7. The Weapons of Mass Destruction and their Delivery Systems (Prohibition of Unlawful Activities) Act, 2005 (21 of 2005)
- 8. Offences under
  - i. Chapter VI of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) [sections 121 to 130 (both inclusive)]
  - ii. Sections 489-A to 489-E (both inclusive) of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860)

There are two circumstances when the NIA takes up a case 'to investigate and prosecute offences':

(i) On reference from a state where a scheduled offence has taken place

On receipt of a report from a state government, the government of India shall determine, within 15 days from the date of receipt, whether the offence is a fit case to be investigated by the NIA.

(ii) Suo motu direction from the government of India

If the government of India is of the opinion that an offence is required to be investigated under the NIA act, it may direct the agency to proceed with investigation. With the issue of such direction, any police officer of the state government investigating the said offence shall transmit the relevant documents and records to the agency. The agency may also investigate any other offence, which the accused is alleged to have committed if it is connected with the scheduled offence under investigation.

It is mandatory for the state government to extend all assistance and cooperation to the agency for investigation of the scheduled offences. The NIA may also ask the state government to associate itself with the investigation. And, after investigating the matter, if the agency finds that the matter is not so important, it may, with the approval of the government of India, transfer the case to the state government for investigation and trial of the offence.

Since the body was established in a concurrent jurisdiction framework, there is no question of violation of federal spirit. Although the Centre has suo motu power to take up any case that falls within the stipulated 8 laws, in practice, it has mostly ventured into cases only on the invitation of the states.

# **Central Bureau of Investigation**

Originally called the Special Police Establishment, it was set up in 1941, but was later renamed in 1963 as the Central Bureau of Investigation. It is administered by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions. It was actually established along the lines of the FBI in the United States. The lawful powers are taken from the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946. It is headed by the Director General of Police who is selected based on the CVC Act, 2003 and holds the post for a 2-year term. It is exempted in the RTI Act, 2005. The Special Police Establishment has two divisions, namely the General Offences Wing and the Economic Offences Wing. The General Wing under the Central Government is responsible for bribery and other corruption activities among the Central Government employees and PSUs. The Economic Wing in turn has four divisions in Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai and Kolkata, which has many subdivisions in many other states which also deal with the same corruption cases. The CBI not only deals with economic crimes but also with other conventional crimes. The CBI is held in high esteem by many pillars of the nation for its quality of being impartial and competent. The CBI deals with any case that is suggested by the Courts.

# *Separate Law for CBI*

Considering that the powers given to the CBI are inadequate, the Department-Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice has suggested a separate law for the premier investigation agency, to replace the more than 70-year-old Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, under which it works at present. The committee said that the current powers of the agency are not in tune with the changing times. In its earlier report the committee opined that not granting ample powers to the CBI amounts to degrading the status of the investigation agency.

'The Committee is of the view that the CBI is the only agency in India which has acquired and accumulated the necessary expertise in successfully investigating wide hues of transnational, terrorist and organised crimes and that enacting an enabling legislation for the CBI will be a major step toward evolving it into an independent and accountable agency which specialises in prevention, investigation and prosecution of crimes', it had said.

Though the recommendation was given on basis that the top investigative agency should work under a law made for its own purpose, the government of India has it turned down stating that it might impinge on the federal structure of the constitution.

# **Research and Analysis Wing**

The Research and Analysis Wing of India was established in 1968 after it was found that information gathered by the Intelligence Bureau was not sufficient enough to be prudent about the two major wars of India with China and Pakistan in 1962 and 1965, respectively. So for proper gathering of intelligence, India needed an agency like the Research and Analysis Wing.

The RAW has been acclaimed to be one of the most fearsome intelligence agencies by many foreign analysts. RAW performs activities like checking the developmental prospects of foreign countries in military, economy and other areas. It is also protects the nuclear operations of the country and is also involved in many anti-terror and covert operations. It also checks for the details of imports of military equipments by Pakistan from other countries.

# **Intelligence Bureau**

The Intelligence Bureau formed in 1887 is the oldest of its kind. It has been re-inducted into the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1947 with a change in the name, whereas it is referred to as the Central Intelligence Bureau. It has its head office in New Delhi. After the formation of RAW, the Intelligence Bureau performs its function within the Indian borders. It collects information from all corners of the country and also performs various anti-terrorism operations. It also performs tapping activities to garner information. The personnel are generally civil servants and military officers and is headed by the Director.

#### **Enforcement Directorate**

The Directorate of Enforcement was initially formed in 1956 as an economic unit and was later renamed as the Enforcement Directorate the next year. It has its headquarters in New Delhi, working under the Finance Ministry and mainly deals with the enforcement of rules that are framed under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. It is an Economic Intelligence Agency that deals with economic crimes.

Economic crimes include illegal acquisition of foreign currency, having an account in a foreign country with no prior information, siphoning off funds, malpractices in the invoicing of exports and imports and remittances of funds of Indian nationals in a foreign country that is not transferred through normal banking channels. The directorate also has a cell called the Vigilance Cell to check if any illegal activities are done by the personnel. This cell is under the direct control of the Director of Enforcement.

#### **Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation**

The Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation under the Finance Ministry is the responsible agency that deals with criminal activities like tax evasions, tax laws and money laundering. It is headed by the Director General of the Income Tax Investigation unit. It generally deals with all the provisions of the Income Tax Act and ensures that they are properly enforced. They also gather information of those who evade taxes and seize black money.

# **Narcotics Control Bureau**

It is an agency that has been created as India is a liaison to it DPSP as its states in article 47 by which the government has been morally obliged to bring about the control of use of prohibitive drugs. The bureau was created under the Home Ministry in 1986. The main purpose was to combat drug trafficking and the use of prohibitive substances. It was headed by the Director General. It has much regional division in many important districts of the country. Its functions include the implementation of counter-measures that are taken by international conventions to counter illegal trafficking and also include the provision to assist foreign countries in action against illicit trafficking and drug abuse.

# **National Technical Research Organisation**

The National Technical Research Organisation is an agency that was formed to provide advice on issues concerning national security to the Prime Minister of India and his or her Council of Ministers. It is new of its kind and works under the control of the National Security Advisor. It is called as a super-feeder agency because it provides all the information that it has gathered to other intelligence agencies. The organisation also monitors satellites and involves in developing technological capabilities in a variety of fields like cryptology, cyber security and other strategic hardware and software developments. It also monitors, calculates and gives prior information about threats to important installations and infrastructures.

# **Crime and Criminal Tracking Network System**

Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS) is a nationwide network infrastructure for the purpose of criminal investigation and detection. The system has been developed by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC).

It is a mission-mode project under the National e-governance plan, and it is being developed as an improvement on the presently used Common Integrated Police Application (CIPA).

**Objectives of CCTNS:** The objectives of the scheme can broadly be listed as follows.

- 1. Make the police functioning citizen friendly and more transparent by automating the functioning of police stations.
- 2. Improve delivery of citizen-centric services through effective usage of ICT.

# **11.12 Chapter 11 • Various Security Forces, Agencies and Their Mandates**

- 3. Provide the investigating officers of the civil police with tools, technology and information to facilitate investigation of crime and detection of criminals.
- 4. Improve police functioning in various other areas such as law and order, traffic management etc.
- 5. Facilitate interaction and sharing of information among police stations, districts, state/UT headquarters and other police agencies.
- 6. Assist senior police officers in better management of the police force.
- 7. Keep track of the progress of cases, including in courts.
- 8. Reduce manual and redundant records keeping.

This project seeks to automate nearly 14,000 police stations across the country. It will incorporate information from police circles, subdivisions, districts, ranges, zones, police headquarters, crime records bureaus, including forensic labs etc. The Maharashtra government is the first in the country to launch the Crime Criminal Tracking Network System (CCTNS) in Mumbai. The government has operationalised 42 cyber laboratories across the state in order to combat growing cybercrimes.

# **NATGRID**

In the light of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, the government of India realised that it needed a digital intelligence network with real-time data accessibility. Thus it was proposed to create NATGRID. By making use of Big Data and analytics to comb and classify information, NATGRID seeks to track terrorists or suspicious activities that could lead to terror attacks. For this purpose the NATGRID will collect and organise information from several intelligence and enforcement agencies throughout the country on a regular basis. It will be headed by a CEO, who will be directly appointed by the government of India.

It will be a secured surveillance database, which will aid in streaming information from 21 sources such as banking transactions, credit card swipes, immigration manifests, travel manifests and similar agencies. It can be accessed currently by authorised officers from 11 agencies on a case-to-case basis in pursuit of investigating terrorism.

The 11 agencies which provided access to NATGRID : Research and Analysis Wing, the Intelligence Bureau, Central Bureau of Investigation, Financial intelligence Unit, Central Board of Direct Taxes, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Enforcement Directorate, Narcotics Control Bureau, Central Board of Excise and Customs and the Directorate General of Central Excise Intelligence.

At present, there are around 70 professionals, drawn from both the government and private sectors, working in NATGRID. It is not an organisation like National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC) and the National Investigation Agency (NIA). It is a tool that will help enforcement agencies to locate, identify, capture terrorists and anticipate terror attacks.

#### **Criticisms**

- NATGRID is facing a lot of criticism due to its possible overreach into privacy and confidential information of individuals.
- It is a completely centralised database that will not be accessible by state police or intelligence agencies.
- Due to its digital nature, experts are of the opinion that it can't be completely free from cyberattacks.
- Wikileaks has demonstrated the ability of surveillance grids to violate individual privacy and compromise the security of confidential information.

As a country that is in the brink of a digital revolution, we need to adapt sophisticated technology to fortify our national security. It has to be agreed that traditional investigative and intelligence methods do fall short of preventing terrorist attacks. And following the inevitable in most cases, a lot of suspects are apprehended – most of them being innocent. To tackle this situation, it is necessary to have a system that will pick out suspicious patterns and unusually peculiar data, which could lead our security agencies much closer to the perpetrators.

The National Security Agency of the government of the United States has a similar intelligence infrastructure called PRISM. The system is used to collect private electronic data of users, through Internet services such as Gmail, Facebook, Outlook and the like. However, the agency can only collect data of those who are suspected or under watch by federal authorities and only when authorised by the court.

It is true that any path-breaking technology will have its own flaws and scope for misuse. But we have to agree that considering the current conditions, NATGRID has to be seen more as a necessity than as a tool that can be misused for vested interests. Provided it is used in the most effective way possible,

NATGRID has all the potential to become the most reliable intelligence tool to secure a peaceful living in the country.

# **National Fingerprints Database**

In the sphere of crime scene investigation, fingerprints form an indispensable part of tangible evidences. It is for this reason that fingerprints of offenders and convicts are meticulously maintained by police departments of state, union territory and central agencies. However, the current system is restricted by territorial jurisdictions and becomes a hurdle in cases where the suspects belong to one state and commit a crime in another. Once police officers collect fingerprints from a crime scene, they run it by the state fingerprint database. If there isn't a credible match, the prints are forwarded to the central database or crime bureaus of other states for verifications.

To tackle this delay, the government of India has taken up the enormous task of creating a national fingerprints database. This centralised database seeks to integrate fingerprint data from all states and union territories and maintain it in digitised form.

# **11.14 Chapter 11 • Various Security Forces, Agencies and Their Mandates**

The National Fingerprints Database seeks to integrate about 20 lakh fingerprint records, which are with the police departments of states and union territories. Currently, the Central Finger Print Bureau (CPFB) has digitised around 10 lakh fingerprints of convicts and offenders, who fall under its jurisdiction.

In order to enable police departments across the country with an easy access to this database, the National Informatics Centre is hosting it on a cloud server to facilitate faster investigations. In future, other biometric data such as digital images, palm prints, iris records etc. of convicts and repeat offenders are also to be included.

# **Benefits of the Move**

- It helps in better organising the fingerprints of criminals, offenders and history-sheeters through a centralised database.
- It aids in fast-tracking the investigation process.
