#### **introdUCtion**

The term 'organised crime' brings to mind the Mumbai underworld. Haji Masthan, a renowned smuggler in Mumbai who reigned from 1955 to 1975, was the leader of an organised crime gang. Varedheraje Mudaliar of the period 1970s and 1980s and Dawood Ibrahim of the same period are a few organised crime leaders in India.

The FBI defines organised crime as any gang having some manner of a formalised structure and whose primary objective is to obtain money through illegal activities. Such gangs maintain their position through the use of actual or threatened violence, corrupt public officials, graft or extortion, and generally have a significant impact on the people in their locales, region or the country as a whole.

Interpol defines organised crime as "any enterprise or gang of persons engaged in continuing illegal activity which has its primary activities that bring together a client–public relationship which demands a range of goods and services which are illegal."

 The Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act, 1999, defines organised crime as any continuing unlawful activity by an individual, singly or jointly, either as a member of an organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such a syndicate, by use of violence or threat of violence or intimidation or coercion, or other unlawful means, with the objective of gaining pecuniary benefits, or gaining undue economic or other advantage for himself or any person or promoting insurgency.

Organised crime disturbs peace and tranquillity. It violates human rights and undermines the existing political and criminal justice system.

#### **Characteristics of Organised Crime**

The nature and character of organised criminal gangs differ from each other. However, they have some common character. Some of the characters are common in organised and formal organisations also.

- **1. Continuity:** The crime gang is not an end in itself. Survivorship and succession are characteristics of these criminal gangs. They survive beyond the lifetime of the gang members. These gangs are structured in such a way that they survive changes in leadership and succession. The successor or the new leader would be the son or second in line of the deceased or the imprisoned or the exiled.
- **2. Structure:** The criminal gangs are hierarchical and well structured. A host of interdependent individual sub-gangs are assigned specific tasks which eventually serve the organisations' objective. The hierarchical ranks in the organisation are based on power that one yields and proximity to the leader.
- **3. Membership:** To become a core member of the criminal gang one has to belong to an ethnic gang or should have a criminal background or should be driven by mutual interest or should be really close with the leader. Scrutiny and probation are crucial parts of member recruitment. Potential members have to prove their worth and loyalty to become part of the criminal gang. To that end, they are required to perform daring risky tasks. Money, economic benefits, power and prestige are given in return for being loyal.
- **4. Criminality:** Organised criminal gang is synonymous to criminality. Their main source of income is crime. They may indulge in legitimate and illegitimate businesses to earn income. Illegitimate businesses include extortion, kidnapping, murder, intimidation, robbery, flesh trade, drug peddling, smuggling, etc.
- **5. Violence:** Violence is an integral part of organised crime. Violence is targeted at individuals or property. Most of the violence is carried out in open for people to see or is done in such a way so as to create an identity. The intention is to create an atmosphere of fear in the community. These members would carry out activities to show that they are in charge and not the law enforcement.
- **6. Intimidation:** To get their job done criminal gangs indulge in intimidation. Intimidation may be overt or covert. The threat is both to people and government officials. Intimidation is often also employed to force compromises or settlements in inter- and intra-gang disputes.
- **7. Public disorder:** Criminal gangs resort to disturbing public order and tranquillity. They resort to such acts to show that they are in power and not the government. Panic among the public is the motive behind such public disorder.

#### 10.4 Chapter 10 • Organised Crime

The public are harassed with utter disregard for the rule of law. Such acts help in consolidation of their control over public, government and rival gangs.

- 8. Monopolisation of trade: Criminal gangs that diversify into legitimate businesses attempt to establish monopolies using muscle power. Labour contracts in ports and constructions, sand quarry contracts, etc. are some examples of monopolisation of trade by organised gangs. Liquor outlet contracts are awarded to such organised gangs mostly as monopoly, only through the threat of violence.
- 9. Corruption: Corruption is hand in glove with organised crime. Crime thrives in a corrupt atmosphere. It is a core means adopted by criminal gangs to get most of their work done. Buying off of law enforcement officials particularly higher officials and politicians showcases the strength of criminal gang in the area. This enables them to carry out their illegal actives without any resistant from government officials.
- 10. **Protectors:** Corrupt government officials, prosecutors, politicians and businessmen are the protectors of criminal gangs. They abuse their position in power, status, privilege and discretion to protect the criminal gangs. They insulate the criminals from both civil and criminal government actions.

#### TYPES OF ORGANISED CRIME

#### **Drug Trafficking**

This is perhaps the most heinous organised crime that affects the country. It is transnational in character. Geographically, India is nestled between the Golden Triangle and the Golden Crescent, the world's leading producers of narcotics. Given its location, India acts as a transit for narcotics produced in these regions to the rest of the world especially to the west. Opium is cultivated in India legally under licensing for medicinal purposes. A considerable amount from such cultivation also finds place in the illicit market. Most of the organised crime syndicates make most of their earnings by trafficking in drugs.

#### **Smuggling**

Smuggling of goods consists of clandestine activities, and unrecorded trade is a major economic offence. The quantity and nature of contraband goods smuggled are incidental on the fiscal policies adopted by the government.

India with a vast coastline and open porous borders with neighbouring countries is prone to smuggling of contraband goods. Textile items and electronic items were smuggled in the 1970s which necessitated the establishment of the Indian coast guard in 1978. Even now, smuggling of gold is reported between Sri Lanka and India. During the reign of LTTE in northern Sri Lanka, large-scale smuggling of weapons, fuel and supplies was recorded. All such smuggling activities are orchestrated by organised crime syndicates.

#### **Money Laundering**

Money laundering is the act of converting illegal money into legal money. It is done to integrate the ill-gotten money into the legitimate economy. Proceeds from drug trafficking, smuggling, prostitution, counterfeit currencies and other gang-related crimes are the prime source of money laundering. Other sources for money laundering are money from tax evasion, violation of exchange laws, etc. The idea behind money laundering is to obscure the origin of the money. Through a process of placement, layering and integration the illegitimate money is integrated into legitimate economy. It is one of the most sophisticated activities of organised crime syndicates. Lawyers, chartered accountants and auditors are an integral part of money-laundering rackets. The direct involvement of such high-ranked professionals in organised crime makes money laundering one of the most intelligent activities of organised crime and is highly lucrative.

#### **Terrorism**

Terrorism is one of the most serious problems which India faces today. Terrorism's motive being political and ideological does not directly fall under organised crime. The Indian experience, however, shows that organised crime syndicates run parallel to terrorist main frame activities, of which narco-terrorism is a prominent one. Since income derived from narco terrorism is used to fund terrorism activities; most terrorist organisations sponsor narco-terrorism.

#### **Contract Killings**

Organised crime gangs provide highly specialised and professional services in case someone prominent with a huge wallet wants someone to be eliminated. This is what is termed as contract killing. There are variations in the intensity of offence, assault, dismemberment, vandalism, etc., which have different compensation packages for the organised crime gang.

#### **Kidnapping for Ransom**

Kidnapping for ransom is most prevalent in the cities. It is a highly profitable crime as it brings huge financial gains compared to the risk involved. The victims selected are such people who have huge ill-gotten wealth who can spare a good sum of money. Since they are less likely to report the matter to the police, this kind of crime flourishes.

#### **Migrant Trafficking**

Employment rackets are on the rise in recent years. The demand for cheap skilled and unskilled labour abroad particularly in the middle-east, and the young unemployed workforce in India has made employment agencies a thriving business. The difficulty in obtaining valid travel documents and job opportunities abroad drives people to employment agencies. While there are legitimate agencies for skilled labour, it is the unskilled labour who falls into the unscrupulous illegal employment agencies who promise them jobs and take huge sums of money from the gullible victims.

#### **Flesh Trade**

Trading women is a very profitable business which the underworld carries out profitably. Flesh trade has been flourishing in various places, especially in cities like Calcutta and Mumbai. The organised crime gang is closely associated with brothels, pimps, escort services and call girl rackets making plenty of money in the process. They supply young girls to various parts of the country and are shuttled from one city to another to minimise the risk of the sex workers getting familiarised with the place which may get the gang on the law enforcement radar. According to the Indian Health Organisation, there are over 1,000,000 sex workers in Bombay and Calcutta each, about 40,000 in Delhi and Pune each and an estimated 20,000 in Chennai. All such cases of flesh trade take place under the sanction of organised crime gangs.

#### **Arms Proliferation**

Fire arms proliferation is extremely dangerous to the peace in any country. The weapon of mass destruction has been small fire arms. They take a heavy toll on human lives, a quantum which can never be adequately estimated. Syria, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan are the worst-affected countries. Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Sudan and other African states in turmoil continue to see deaths in thousands due to fire arms. India has suffered and is still suffering due to trafficking in illicit arms. Left-wing extremism, militancy and other armed movements in the northeast owe their position today to fire arms. Rising crime, armed conflicts and terrorism are directly linked to arms proliferation. Organised gangs do not manufacture arms, but establish and maintain a clandestine network from sellers to buyers, which enable proliferation of fire arms seamlessly.

#### **Cyber Crime**

With the increasing dependence on computers and growth of Internet users, new-generation crimes in cyber space have created extraordinary situations. They have posed new challenges to law enforcement agencies in India and elsewhere. Hacking, computer network breaches, copyright piracy, software piracy, child pornography, password sniffers and credit card frauds are some of the new crimes committed by gangs. Highly intelligent persons commit these new-generation crimes leaving hardly any trace and making investigation highly difficult and complicated. The technology and skill available with law enforcement agencies have not developed enough to catch up with cyber crime.

#### **Wildlife Trafficking**

Trade in wildlife is a money-generating business for organised criminal groups. Poaching of skin and body parts of animals and smuggling of live exotic wildlife is a rising crime today. Elephant ivory, rhino horn and tiger parts are most in demand. Rumours that they have aphrodisiac powers are the main cause of the demand in Asia. Trafficking of these products in Asia alone produces \$75 million in profits each year. According to the WWF, traffickers illegally move over 100 million tons of fish, 1.5 million live birds and 440,000 tons of medicinal plants per year.

#### **NARCOTICS PROBLEM OF PUNJAB**

The problem of narcotics trade and addiction has been one of the biggest challenges Punjab is facing. It is so widespread that drug addiction has crept all over the state across cities, towns and villages. Recent studies made by the government suggest that around 8.5 lakh youth are affected by drug abuse and that the most vulnerable population is within the range of 15–35 years of age.

Historically, the consumption of opium husk seems to have been a customary practice among rural folk, similar to 'a drink after a day's work' culture in the urban scene. According to reports, in rural Punjab, at least onethird of the population consumes opium. The little opium cultivation within Punjab and Rajasthan was supplying to this market. But when the Punjab government decided to shut the doors on this trade, the vacuum thus created was filled by alternatives such as pharma drugs and heroin.

The problem of drug addiction is not restricted to the affluent sections of the society alone. In fact, most of them are from economically weaker sections. The problem magnifies in intensity when addicts don't have enough money to buy these drugs. It leads them into crimes such as drug peddling, extortion, robbery etc.

Adding to the sources of opium within India, security agencies repeatedly point out towards the border with Pakistan. The regular interception of drug parcels near the border means that it acts as a major conduit through which drug trade happens. The proximity of Punjab to the Golden Crescent and the limited availability of other drugs make heroin the most preferred drug.

Though policy measures have been taken by the government to address the menace of drug trade, it has primarily been towards restricting supply. But drug abuse is a problem that has to be addressed with a multidimensional approach. It should be noted that more than being a problem of supply, drug abuse is a problem of demand. While crackdowns on drug networks are necessary, intensive rehabilitation measures for addicts are of prime importance to address the issue. In the past decade alone, hundreds of narcotic rehabilitation centres have sprung up across the state. But the proliferation of drug addicts hasn't significantly reduced due to lack of a cohesive approach between NGOs, medical-care institutions and the governments.

The problem is multifold and holds much at stake as it is not just the health of the addicts that is in peril. Drug abuse leads to many other torts and crimes such as public nuisance, road accidents, sexual abuse etc. Unless a comprehensive approach is made, the menace of drug abuse cannot be addressed effectively.

#### **Problems in Control Efforts**

#### **Inadequate Legal Structure**

India is yet to have an exclusive law to suppress organised crime. The acts of organised crime are dealt with available provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and special acts of states. Further, the existing law targets individuals and not gangs. It treats individual acts of crime separately and fails to connect the various crimes committed by the same organised gang. Therefore, for a crime by an organised criminal gang, one or few individuals will be persecuted and the network still remains.

#### **Difficulties in Obtaining Proof**

The organised criminal gangs have a pyramidal structure of hierarchy. The higher ranks of leadership are insulated from the lower-level mercenaries. Often the lower-level mercenaries might not have even seen or spoken to the leader of the gang they are a part of. The actual perpetrators of crime may get convicted, but it is very difficult to link the crime to the boss and persecute him or her owing to loopholes in the criminal laws. The major hurdle in connecting the kingpins to the crime is non-admissibility of confessions made to the police by lower-rung criminals. Lack of a witness protection program is cited as a reason for witnesses not deposing out of fear for life.

#### **Lack of Resources and Training**

According to the 7th Schedule of the Constitution, the police are the State subject. Investigation, prosecution and establishment of criminal courts are the responsibility of the State Government. Most states have very limited resources to spend for criminal justice systems as most of them are spent on social sector programs.

First, the Indian Police Force is grievously understaffed and overworked. India has one of the poorest police to population ratio. As of 2013 the national average is 130 police officers for every 100,000 people. This is way below the United Nations standard of 450 police officers for every 100,000 people.

Second, the police are not trained to deal with organised crime. Their training involves dealing with conventional crime, and organised crime is neglected. The investigation of organised crime requires speed, skills, support and patronage from the higher echelons of power, which is very much lacking in most cases.

#### **Lack of Co-ordination**

Organised crime syndicates are not localised. They transcend state boundaries and sometimes even national boundaries. Public order being state subject, each state has its own mechanism in dealing with organised crime. While the jurisdiction of the law enforcement agencies is restricted to the state, the crime syndicates' jurisdiction is pan India. The mob boss sitting in Goa can order a hit in Chennai. Similarly, a mob boss sitting in Delhi can run a drug racket in Goa. Further, there is no central agency to directly deal with or to co-ordinate the efforts of the State/Police as well as central enforcement agencies to combat organised crime. In such situations, there is very limited scope for the law enforcement agencies in bringing down the entire crime ring.

#### **Criminal, Political and Bureaucratic Nexus**

The rapid growth and spread of organised crime syndicates establish an extensive network of contacts with the bureaucrats, police, politicians and elected representatives at the local level. In states like Bihar, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, politics is very closely interlinked with these gangs. The worst cases are of criminal gang leaders becoming elected representatives. As the mob boss becomes powerful he or she turns the politicians, police and bureaucrats into puppets.

#### **Dual Criminality**

The crime syndicates care very less about national boundaries let alone state boundaries. On one hand crime transcends boundaries and on the other hand criminals cross boundaries swiftly and with not much difficulty. Drug trafficking, cyber crime, arms trafficking, etc. are planned at one place and executed at another place. Criminals commit the crime in one place and move on to another place. This places crime and criminals in multiple legal jurisdictions. This provides duality to crime. The very definition of what constitutes a crime varies from one place to another. Money laundering is a crime in USA and several European countries but not in Pakistan or Bangladesh. Prostitution is legal in Amsterdam while it is illegal in Chennai. These hassles make it difficult in controlling organised crime, which is across borders.

#### **Transnational Organised Crime**

With globalisation, organised crime has also become globalised. Goods will be sourced from one part of the world and trafficked to another part of the world. Transnational organised crime infiltrates governments and other institutions. They influence business and politics, hindering economic and social development. Transnational organised crime empowers the outlaws by giving power over the lives of commoners, thereby directly questioning the idea of democracy.

Transnational organised crime groups forge bonds across borders, which overcome cultural, ethnic and linguistic differences. Organised crime is dynamic and flexible. They adapt as new demands emerge. The relationship between the criminal groups is flexible and keeps changing to accommodate new ventures. This makes transnational organised crime more lethal.

#### **United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime**

The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, adopted by General Assembly resolution 55/25 of 15 November 2000, is the main international instrument in the fight against transnational organised crime. The convention is further supplemented by three protocols, which target specific areas and manifestations of organised crime: the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children; the Protocol Against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air; and the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, their Parts and Components and Ammunition. Countries have to become parties to the convention before they can become parties to any of the protocols.

The convention represents a major step forward in the fight against transnational organised crime. It also signifies the recognition by member states of the seriousness of the problems posed by it, as well as the need to foster and enhance close international cooperation in order to tackle those problems. States that ratify this instrument commit themselves to taking a series of measures against transnational organised crime, including the creation of domestic criminal offences (participation in an organised criminal group, money laundering, corruption and obstruction of justice); the adoption of new and sweeping frameworks for extradition, mutual legal assistance and law-enforcement cooperation and the promotion of training and technical assistance for building or upgrading the necessary capacity of national authorities.

The Government of India has ratified two UN Conventions – the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UNTOC) and its three protocols.

Apart from the UNTOC, three other protocols target specific forms of organised crime, namely:

- (1) The Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children,
- (2) The Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air and
- (3) The Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, their Parts and Components and Ammunition

#### **Differences Between Terrorism and Organised Crime**

- a. Organised crime is driven by economic profit and material benefits, whereas terrorism is driven by political power and ideology.
- b. While violence is part of both terrorism and organised crime, the nature of violence differs. Targeted hurt or killing is the kind of violence adopted by organised crime. On the other hand, mass killing is the kind of violence adopted by terrorism.
- c. The first and only choice of weapon for terrorists is violence, whereas for organised criminal gangs non-violence is the first choice of weapon. They indulge in violence as a last-ditch effort.
- d. Crimes such as drug trafficking, fraud, ransom kidnapping and contract killing are committed by organised criminal gangs. But terrorism use violence in the form of hijacking, bombing, fedayeen attacks, etc.
- e. Terrorists since have an ideology or political agenda and seek media attention. Organised crime gangs on the other hand operate underground and have to remain anonymous to serve their economic gains. Therefore, they do not seek any media attention.
- f. Terrorists attack governments, law enforcement agencies, infrastructures and importantly innocent citizens, while organised criminal gangs generally do not indulge in such activities.
- g. Public opinion forms the core of terrorist agenda, which is not the case with organised criminal gangs. Organised criminal gangs are not concerned with influencing public opinion, whereas terrorists need to influence and alter the public opinion in order to spread their ideology and eventually change the political system.

#### **LINKAGE BETWEEN ORGANISED CRIME AND TERRORISM**

Despite the disparate objectives of terrorism and organised crime syndicate, differentiating the two can sometimes be difficult. Terrorists also indulge in crimes traditionally linked with organised crime gangs to generate revenue. This revenue is used to fund their activities in pursuit of their political or ideological agendas. The chief source of revenue for the Taliban is drug trafficking and that of ISIS is women trafficking.

Organised criminals have also adopted violent techniques used by terrorists to advance their economic gains. Over time crime syndicates also wear an ideological coat and follow the path of terrorists. As the crime ring gets powerful, they get closely linked with political power. The more power the gang acquires, the easier it is for the black market to flourish.

In addition, organised crime groups act as subordinate organisations to terrorist groups. They provide smuggled arms and explosives to terrorist gangs in exchange for drugs, diamonds, money, etc. Creating fake passports, smuggling terrorists into countries are all done by organised crime groups. Terrorists use networks established by transnational organised gangs to move men and material around the world.

In India, the linkages between the terrorists and organised crime exist at national and transnational levels. In the northeast the insurgents run parallel governments and control areas which are out of bounds of the governments. They collect money akin to tax directly from the people and at times from the government officials too. Further, government officials are either bribed or threatened to award contracts in favour of the insurgents. Even rations meant to be supplied to the public go via the insurgents who charge a special tax over them. They also mobilise funds by smuggling drugs, arms and human beings across borders. Moreh, Chittagong Hill tracts, especially Cox's Bazaar, act as transit points for smuggling. Any terror outfit or crime syndicate may avail these services of these insurgents for a fee. These are clear examples of the existence linkage between organised criminal gangs and terrorism inside India.

In the Kashmir valley, however, the linkages between organised criminal gangs and terrorists are very different. They do not rely on drug trade or extortion for funds. They do not run any parallel governments in Kashmir. Their source of funds are mostly external and mainly arising out of Pakistan. Money laundering is the chief means of channelling funds from organisations abroad to terrorist outfits. It is believed that the ISI is the chief funding source for militant activities in Kashmir. Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) are also circulated by militants to general illegal income.

Besides Kashmir and the northeast, other parts of India like Bombay witnessed the close link between terrorists and organised crime syndicates. The serial bomb blasts of 1993 have exposed the connection between terrorism and organised gangs.

#### **The Way Forward**

#### **Enhancing International Co-operation**

The globalised nature of organised crime requires a concerted effort of several nations to actually bring down organised crime. Quick means of transport and communication enable the criminals to flee one country to another within hours of committing the crime. Information technology revolution enables crime gangs to control activities spanning continents without any physical presence. The difficulty lies in not being able to bring the fugitives in other countries to justice for acts committed in one's country. It goes without saying that international co-operation is the key to suppressing transnational crimes.

#### **10.14 Chapter 10 • Organised Crime**

International co-operation should include

- 1. swift extradition of criminals,
- 2. agreement on mutual assistance from foreign countries,
- 3. multi-lateral mechanisms for transfer of data on crimes,
- 4. mutual sharing of knowledge and
- 5. agreements for suppression of terrorism with neighbours.

#### *Strong Political Commitment*

The Vohra Committee Report has exposed the relationship between politicians and criminal gangs. Cutting across party lines, politicians depend on organised criminal gangs for funding their elections and muscle power for rigging elections. To bring this nexus to an end, election reforms are necessary and for that to take place strong commitment on behalf of the political parties is required.

#### *Role of Mass Media*

Mass media – both print and electronic – can play an important role in exposing organised crime and help build public opinion against it. Notable newspapers and magazines have also taken to investigative journalism, which helps to expose the activities of criminal gangs. Mass media can play a major role in mobilising public opinion against crime and criminal gangs.

#### *A Strong Police Force*

A strong police force is an anathema of criminal gangs. It is the Mumbai Police who ultimately crushed the criminal gangs of Mumbai, who once dominated the law and order theatre of Mumbai city. A highly professional and reasonably motivated police force can prevent the emergence of any crime gang. They can also break the backbone of such a gang that has established itself over a period of time.
