*In a modern society, security is not military hardware, though it may include it. Security is not traditional military activity, though it may encompass it. Security is not a military force, though it may involve it. Security is development – without development, there is no security. A developing nation that does not in fact develop, simply cannot remain secure, for the intractable reason that its own citizenry cannot shed its human nature.*

– Robert McNamara

The most important duty of the government is to serve the people and guarantee the security of the citizen and the nation. National security is about the free will of the government to take its own decision and to maintain the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The policies enacted by the government to ensure the survival of the state with the use of military, economic and diplomatic power in war and peace refer to internal security. Thus, it is an essential component in the overall security of the nation.

The State has been given the constitutional power and responsibility to protect the stability, harmony and security of its citizen. Thus, the State as an

## **1.2 Chapter 1 • Introduction**

organisation can justify to itself only by maintaining the peace, tranquility and internal security.

Managing internal security is a highly complicated and tedious process in a multi-faceted country like India because various factors like geography, history, governance, economic development, socio-economic inequalities and sociocultural customs have their own influence in the security of the nation. Not only regional factors but also global factors play a major role in the internal security of the nation. The threat to internal security is widely caused by organised or individual violence from state or non-state actors, which are the violation of the law of the land.

Many aspects of the threat cannot be differentiated; still there exists some fundamental distinctions between external and internal threats and also between external and internal security.

| External security                                                  | Internal security                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| From outside the state's boundary                                  | From within the national boundary                                       |
| Violence by a foreign country                                      | Sovereignty and territorial integrity are<br>only considered            |
| Armed forces are responsible for<br>safeguarding the country       | Police force is responsible for maintaining<br>public order             |
| Ministry of Defence is the nodal<br>ministry for external security | Ministry of Home Affairs is the nodal<br>ministry for internal security |

#### **Definition**

(a) Internal security is the process of maintaining peace within the boundaries of a sovereign state and other self-governing territories, usually done by maintaining national law. The liability to maintain internal security lies in the hands of the police, paramilitary forces and in exceptional cases with the military.

 Broadly, internal security can be defines as one that deals with a security situation that arises within the state boundary, therefore distinguishing itself from external security situations.

(b) Every civil service aspirant must have an idea about the term 'National Security', which has a much wider meaning and scope. National Security is a concept where a government should make sure that the State and its citizens are protected against all kinds of crises through its political, diplomatic, economic and military might.

 Thus, internal security is an obligation of the State to protect its boundaries. The State has a wider responsibility in the form of preventing various kinds of crime, to protect the fundamental rights of its citizens, to make sure of the proper functioning of the democracy, to assure its citizen protection of life and property and finally to create an atmosphere of peace and harmony. The security forces play an important role in neutralising the threat to the country's borders.

# **Attributes Of Internal Security**

#### **The various attributes of internal security are:**

- to safeguard the sovereignty of the nation,
- to protect domestic peace and tranquility,
- proper maintenance of law and order,
- equality before law and equal protection of the law,
- to ensure that people are free of any fear or oppression and
- peaceful co-existence and communal harmony.

# **Major Reasons/Causes/Sources of Internal Security Disturbance**

There are many challenges to internal security. Some of them are as follows:

- Lack of proper governance: ◊ a feeling of alienation in citizens and ◊ electoral reforms including intra-party democracy deficit.
- Improper labour laws, deficit financing, ineffective economic growth benefits, development disparities, effect of subsidies, improper income distribution and ineffective monitoring of government expenditure.
- Communal tensions, social injustice, societal divisions based on caste, language and religion, ethnicity and narrow-minded vote bank politics.
- Lack of effective technologies.
- Use of armed forces of the union, viz. the army in counter-insurgency operations and in other internal security situations.
- Poor and out-dated laws.
- Lack of political will to enforce the laws to maintain stringent internal security policy.
- Lack of effective policies to control media and other mass communication institutions.
- Disparities in socio-economic development.

# **Traditional Internal Security Challenges**

The following are the challenges that are encountered in internal security conventionally:

![](_page_3_Figure_1.jpeg)

# **Non-Traditional Internal Security Challenges**

In the globalised era, new dimensions give rise to various internal security challenges. They are:

- epidemics and pandemics,
- cyber security threats,
- climate change challenges,
- disaster risk reduction and management,
- HIV/AIDS challenges,
- small arms and light weapons proliferation and
- environmental security threats.

#### *Traditional global internal security challenges*

Inter-state confrontation has reduced after the end of the cold war. Various external forces now oppose the intra-state conflicts as the current situation is ripe. For example, in the Syrian crisis, various countries have covertly supported either the regime or its opposition forces even when the internal situation in Syria did not escalate into war. One can also notice in conflicts in the middle-east region like Yemen that the world countries have never shown much interest in taking sides.

Thus, in the present-day context at the global level, internal security is threatened by the common sources, and it has to be dealt with by the states and with the help of other similar-minded nations to curb the menace.

The shifting of power towards Asia from the western nations caused the present century to be called an 'Asian century', and any vulnerability in this region would have had a high potential to change the course of history in the globalised environment. The devaluation of Chinese currency has made a sound impact on many economies similar to the 2008 financial crisis.

The foremost intra-regional threat now is terrorism. Different groups of terrorists have different demands but the motive is the same – that of causing damage to life and property of innocent citizens. Terrorism is now spread in almost every region of the continent. The serious evolving threat is that the falling of nuclear warheads in the hands of terrorists due to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and any situation like that would lead to great loss.

The rise in militaries has never put countries into war, but the armed force is widely used to neutralise internal threats. Civil war-like situations across the world have increased the strength of armed forces, and are indeed used to protect the ruling establishment.

Specially, instability in the Afghanistan–Pakistan region poses serious threats to the whole world. It is the hub of terrorist organisations like the Taliban and the Al-Qaeda. Any activity in this region has far greater implications. The withdrawal of USA's forces from Afghanistan has produced a vacuum, which has created instability in the region, and it also has the potential to divide Afghanistan. This has created numerous problems for India in the border regions with Pakistan. India with its inaccessible terrain and numerous terrorist camps and young terrorists pose as terror threats to weaken the northern border.

#### **1.6 Chapter 1 • Introduction**

Being in the middle of the Golden Crescent and the Golden Triangle, India faces threats from drug traffickers and gun runners who use the instability in the region to establish an anarchical state.

Recent conflicts in Libya, Syria, Yemen, etc. were not prevented by the United Nations or any other multilateral organisations, and it appears that these organisations are powerless in times of such conflicts. India's request for reform in such multilateral bodies has to be given due consideration because only a powerful multilateral body can prevent such conflicts from growing into a prolonged civil war.

Maritime security needs to be given a lot of importance from maritime nations as nearly 95 per cent of trade is through the sea and 95 per cent of Internet traffic is via undersea cables. Thus, the safety of Sea Lines of Communication (SLOC) should be given due consideration, and trade must be carried out without any threat. Mercantile Navy is threatened by sea pirates around the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia, and various nations have joined their hands in protecting the sea from the threat of pirates. India, a subcontinent, with a coast line of 7,600 km has had a bitter experience of terrorists arriving from the sea. For example, the 26/11 Mumbai attack, which was carried out by terrorists who hijacked a boat from Karachi, is the best example of maritime terrorism. Thus, maritime security includes terrorist's threats, smuggling of narcotics, gun running and trafficking, which also pose serious internal security challenges to India.

Conflicts in west Asia have reduced the investments in new technologies to efficiently produce hydrocarbons, and this reduction in hydrocarbon reserves and conflicts in the regions of high hydrocarbons reserves has increased concerns over energy security. Thus, we are left to face the situation of reduced output of hydrocarbon. If energy is not secured, the world may have to face a war of oil once again. India being a developing nation requires enormous amounts of oil for its sustenance. A number of reasons have been a hindrance in exploiting its energy reserves internally. India's energy security has been derailed by externally induced internal threats.

#### *Non-traditional global internal security challenges*

In recent years many newer challenges apart from traditional security challenges have far wider implications. Climate change is one among them, which is caused by global warming. Global warming leads to the melting of glaciers, which in turn raises the sea level and submerges island nations and low-lying coastal areas. Moreover, climate change also has its impact in agriculture by changes in the rainfall pattern and reducing its output and can also cause huge water stress. Thus, the world is faced with increased risk of a water war. Highly rainfall-dependent countries like India have to be prudent against the looming climate change and its consequences.

The recent case of the Ebola virus is a good example of how the world is interconnected, a disease affecting a remote African nation led to a huge global scare. Another example is the SARS virus in south Asia, which caused such a stir some years ago. Communicable diseases emanating anywhere have such potential to turn out to be a global pandemic. Every nation has to protect itself from these threats. In India's case, our country has to be highly vigilant, owing to its huge and dense population and poor sanitary practices, as any such pandemic disease can become uncontrollable. A nation that is developed has to provide healthy long life to its citizens and protect them from such pandemics.

The interconnected world has paved the way for everyone to be connected via the Internet. Information and communication technology has transformed the whole world. It has provided various advantages that have made life easy, but it also has numerous disadvantages, the most prominent cyber threat having manifold negative implications. Cyber threat is a malware infecting individual computers to disrupt its services and may lead to cyber war. Such attack has the potential to threaten the whole nation. Thus, cyber security threat is the emerging internal security challenge. Apart from physical military confrontations, cyber confrontations have increased. India had faced and has been facing a number of cyber attacks from across the borders. Thus, the government has to provide necessary protection to its data and its citizens from such attacks.

#### **India's Internal Security Challenges**

![](_page_6_Figure_4.jpeg)

Some of the internal security challenges with respect to India are as follows:

# **Unstable Neighborhood**

Unstable neighborhood has made India vulnerable to security threats. Pakistan is waging a covert or secret war against India when it is fighting terrorists overtly in its own tribal provinces. Nepal has emerged from years of insurgency of Maoist fighters; it has recently agreed to sign a constitution based on federalism. Bangladesh, itself facing threats from fundamentalist forces, has cracked down on militants but still serves as a hiding place for insurgents. Insurgents from the northeastern part of India use Myanmar as their base. Though Myanmar has opened up to democracy, it has to get stronger in administration to prevent regional and ethnic tensions in its provinces and also other anti-national elements. Thus, even if stability is maintained internally in India, it can easily be disturbed by various elements acting from foreign soil.

# **Insurgency in the Northeast**

Since independence, the northeastern region has suffered from a number of secessionist, and extremist insurgent activities. All seven states in the northeast is a party to some kind of movement, but its motive and demands differ. Though the constitutional provision for creating autonomous tribal regions has been made with greater power, it has not been realised. The Nationalist Social Council of Nagaland (NSCN) is one among the well-known insurgent organizations, which runs a government in exile from Myanmar.

# **Threat of Communalism**

Communalism has created a disorder in India, right from the British days of 'divide and rule' to the days of partition. The seed of hatred had been well established in the Indian psyche. Communal forces are whipped up by bad elements that seek to achieve their economical and political motives. Communal clashes have created disillusionment among various minority religions. The government is working hard to take a neutral stand in the atmosphere where the balance is one sided.

# **Caste Conflicts**

Mutual hatred between castes has paved the way for violence, and to the new age honour killings. Caste panchayats have taken people towards the medieval era. Caste violence, regionalism and ethnicity have displaced thousands of people and have created tension. A good example is the huge exodus of northeast people from the south. The result of Telangana movement was positive; it has still divided people who speak the same language based on territory. Such kind of regional and ethnic problems continue making it a tough task for the government to deal with such situations. The police force in the states devote their far share of time and resources to present and to deal with caste clashes.

# **Regional and Ethnic Conflicts in Various Parts of The Country**

The ethnic conflicts across different regions of the country have raised a number of internal security issues. Ethnic conflicts in northeastern states and the sonof-the-soil theory in Maharashtra are a few examples. The conflicts sometimes require the use of a larger force to bring the situation under control.

# **Left Wing Extremist Movement**

The Naxal Movement or the Left Wing Extremism has been the source of extreme violence in some parts of the country. These extremists are internally waging wars against the state. It is considered to be the most important internal security concern. These extremist movements have disconnected several tribal villages from the national main stream. Maoism requires abolition of the State to establish the rule of people. The extremists attack the symbols of the country's power such as the police, schools and other government institutions. Multi-pronged strategies have been developed by the government to contain this movement.

#### **Situation in Jammu and Kashmir**

Jammu and Kashmir militancy is perennial; it poses grave internal security problems. This problem, which has been in the scene since the partition of the country, has the character of communal tension, secessionist tendency, anti-state violence and intervention by an external state. Since then, Pakistan has tried various ways to overtly and covertly wane away the state, and one such way is militancy. Youths of Kashmir are indoctrinated, trained in Pakistan and aggravated to wage war against India. The militancy has now been reduced as fruits of development reach the people. Developments in Jammu are also felt across the rest of the country, making it one of the most significant internal security issues in India.

#### **Trans-border Migration From Bangladesh**

The burning issue in the northeastern part of India is the illegal immigrants from Bangladesh especially in Assam, West Bengal and adjoining areas, which have serious socio-political implications. This issue as mandated by the government is to be dealt by the Border Security Force (BSF), and the *Foreigner Tribunal* issue but makes seasonal appearances during the general elections time.

Illegal migration usually occurs through the porous land borders; the migrants can swim along the river to reach India. Some of these migrants are involved in anti-national activities like terrorism, arms trade, money laundering, fake currency rackets, which pose a severe challenge to the internal security. Most of them settle down as Indians in most parts of the country making unhealthy demographic changes across the country.

# **Misuse of IT Tools**

The introduction of information and communication technology has led to a new vista in lifestyle and it also throws many security challenges. The computer that has been used to commit a crime, or a target may be, it is cyber crime either way.

Misuse of information technology tools refers more precisely to criminal exploitation of the Internet. Cyber crime has become high profile, particularly hacking, copyright infringement, identity theft, child pornography and child grooming. Confidential information is lost or stolen, otherwise leading to the problem of privacy.

Globally, both governments and non-state actors grow in importance, with the ability to engage in cross-border attacks referred to as cyber warfare. Strategic establishments have become the target of attack by misguided youths in hostile countries because of which cyber security systems will have to be strengthened.

#### **China's Interest in the Northeast**

China's official map itself contains Arunachal Pradesh as an extended territory of southern Tibet. To have its presence and control over the northeastern part of India, China uses all its devices. Some sections of northeast people also support China's efforts as they have similarities with the Chinese racially and culturally.

# **Factors Responsible for Internal Security Problems**

The factors that are responsible for internal security problems in India are:

- large-scale poverty and unemployment,
- lack of proper governance in many regions,
- increased communal violence,
- regional elites using religion, language, region, caste, etc. to their advantage,
- jobless growth,
- unstable neighbourhood,
- open borders, which are difficult to monitor,
- corruption,
- prolonged judicial process and
- caste consciousness.

Some of these factors have their base in history and the others are contemporary. Some of the factors are elaborated here.

# **Poverty and Unemployment**

It is a present-day factor responsible for rise in internal security threats. This is the fundamental reason for the origin of Maoism in India. Our country can prevent the youth from being brainwashed by these forces if these two problems can be reduced. It is the responsibility of the government to address these chronic problems.

# **Governance Deficit**

The lack of governance is a prominent factor that creates internal disturbances. People take up extremist paths to protest in opposition to the government. The steps taken by the government should be proactive and should involve the people and work assiduously to improve their socio-economic condition.

# **Communal Tension**

The other factor that is on the rise that causes internal disturbances is communal tension. People support political parties on the basis of religion, which gives power in the hands of such people, who tend to misuse it.

Gentle politicians are now an uncommon breed. Some people use divisive politics based on language, religion, caste, region, etc. for their gains. This has farreaching effects and can cause death and destruction.

#### **Unequal Growth**

Growth has reached only a small set of people, while the remaining are still reeling under poverty. Thus, the effects of positive growth are not equally distributed and have been a cause for simmering tension to the downtrodden people.

# **Unstable Neighborhood**

Instability in the neighbourhood has been cause for the continuing threat. While Pakistan has been a major player in the prolonging tension in the Kashmir region, countries such as Bangladesh and Myanmar serve as a base for anti-national activities. Open borders with thick forest cover are difficult to be monitored, which serves as a hideout for the militants and to evade capture and prosecution easily.

#### **Corruption**

Corruption is one of the reasons why people fight with government organisations. People see the whole state to be corrupt. To restore order in the society, people strive to overthrow the state and this attracts people to Maoists.

#### **Prolonged Judicial Processes**

In India the judicial process takes a long time and people get delayed justice or are even denied justice; this leads to the proliferation of kangaroo courts. People are disillusioned with time-consuming judicial process, and they start questioning the fairness of the system and the rule of the law.

# **1.12 Chapter 1 • Introduction**

#### **Caste Consciousness**

Even in the globalised environment, caste consciousness has not gone astray. Some section of the people still have a medieval mindset. Recently, there were various pronouncements regarding the fair treatment of women. Honour killings as a part of caste assertions turn ugly. Many Dalit villages in southern states have burnt in caste conflicts. Untouchability, a sin, is still not eliminated and thus serves as a demonstration of caste in our society.

# **India's Defence and Security Policy**

The Defence and Security Policy is a process by which a country deals with any threatening situation. Conventionally, the policy dealt only with external threats originating from an unfriendly state, but now in the current scenario the defence policy also includes internal threat situations. In his book *Defending India*, Jaswant Singh, Former Defence Minister notes that "principle challenges to India historically been and remains the imposition and maintenance of public order".

India's security interests arise from its historical and geographical factors and its political and economic relations with other nations, its resource dependence as a nation of large working population. These interests keep on changing with the dynamic world scenario.

India, a strong nation with the world's largest democracy, is characterised by its international responsibility for peace and freedom. India has enshrined in its constitution values such as freedom and democracy. Being an active member in various international organisations, India pursues its quest for a safe and better world.

India's security policy is based on its constitutional values of secularism, democracy, socialism, peaceful coexistence and pluralism. The central pillar of securely thinking is the strategic autonomy. The police are inclined towards nonmilitary alliances but will select strategic partners. It is always the negotiated settlement, which is preferred. The employment of force is the last resort.

#### **India's Security Objective**

India's security objectives are:

- To protect the citizens from security threats that arise in and out of the country and also to secure public and private properties against the destruction caused by anti-national elements.
- To safeguard the nation against the threat of conventional and nonconventional weapons.
- To apply the principle of *panchsheel* and to enhance co-operation with neighbouring countries to work together on various threats and violence.
- To strengthen India's strategic arms and systems to neutralise threats and for counter-attacks. Indigenisation will help the nation to be independent from others.

- To carry forward mutual co-operation and dialogues with major powers of the world.
- To defend the country's border, the land as well as the coastal border.

# **India's Security Interests**

India's security interests are as follows:

- Prevention and elimination of crisis and issues that endanger the national security and the security of our allies.
- To strengthen south Asian and pan Asian security and partnership.
- To support the values of universality of human rights and democratic ideals, and to promote global acceptance of international laws and reduce income disparity among people.
- Facilitation of free trade with no discrimination to the developing nations, which ensures free communication without any interference across sea lanes, and free global trade is without any hiccups.

### **Present Security Policy Situation**

The responsibility to handle external security threats lies with the Centre. The Ministry of Defence is the nodal ministry for India's defence. The Ministry of Home Affairs controls paramilitary forces such as the Border Security Force, which exclusively guards the border areas, the Indo-Tibetan border police in the border of Nepal and Bhutan, the Central Reserve Police Force, etc. Therefore, the Ministry of Home Affairs also plays a very important role in securing the nation from external threats. Generally, the security policy comes under the defence ministry's purview, but it is finalised by the cabinet. The Prime Minister plays an important role is shaping the security policy, assisted by the National Security Advisor.

The internal security situation comes under the purview of the states. Police forces are under the control of the state governments and any sort of internal disturbance is first controlled by the state's forces. Our constitution has given that it is the responsibility of the centre to protect the state from any sort of aggression; thus, in cases where the situation goes out of hand, the centre deploys armed paramilitary forces such as the Central Reserve Police Force, BSF, ITBP, NSG, etc. The security policy is formed by the centre to control crises such as dealing with Naxalism when it extends beyond the boundaries of a single state, and then the state governments tend to adopt it. The centre may provide the services of the paramilitary forces.

#### **Lacunae in the Present Policy**

There are various factors that make the security policy ineffective. The police, under the state government, are empowered to deal with local situations, but the constitution has provided the union government with the rights to intervene,

# **1.14 Chapter 1 • Introduction**

and this has caused many problems in power sharing between the centre and the states.

Economy is the major reason for the emergence of threats to internal security but is never considered to be a part of the security policy. The lack of coordination between the centre and the state affects the security policy. This lack of co-ordination affects the implementation process of law enforcement making it totally ineffective. Inefficient governance also affects the framing of the security policy. Less participation of the members of civil society, non-governmental bodies and people from grassroots levels lead to such policies that do not reflect the actual reality and the true aspiration of the people, which is more likely to fail.

# **Key Elements of Internal Security Doctrine**

To formulate an effective internal security policy, we need to include the following elements in our internal security doctrine:

- political situation,
- socio-economic consideration,
- governance,
- police and other security forces,
- co-ordination between the centre and state,
- collection of intelligence,
- border area management and
- cyber security management.

#### **Political Situation**

The political situation is some areas is disturbing. Identifying the nature of challenge is important, and it can be on the basis of regional demands or secessionist, separatist tendencies. Identifying the cause of such movements is the key and it has to be made sure that the demands are within the constitutional framework. The state should deal secessionist movements with a heavy hand, and separatist movements should not be engaged in dialogue. The government must have a proper policy to handle such situations effectively. Measures have to be taken to heed regional and ethnic demands if the demands are within the legal and constitutional framework.

#### **Socio-economic Consideration**

It is generally argued and sometimes accepted that socio-economic consideration forms the basis of many internal security threat scenarios. The discontent of the people is genuine as they face shortage of jobs, money and food. These cases should be handled using a different approach. The reason of the agitation should be analysed, and grievances should be addressed. It has to be ensured that the fruits of development are spread without discrimination, and the value of equality enshrined in the constitution is upheld.

#### **Governance**

Anti-state movements launched by some motivated elements are due to the lack of good governance. The people develop ill feelings towards the state because of bad practices like nepotism, corruption, etc. Mismanagement of government funds, inefficient implementation of laws and misappropriation of schemes act as a trigger. To bring in accountability and transparency, it is highly essential to ensure people's participation in governance.

# **Police and Other Security Forces**

Analysts point out that, in most cases, police and other security forces are not sensitised. These forces do not understand their role as a public servant and do not work towards the attainment of a common goal. They act piecemeal under a regimental system. Sometimes they are poorly trained and not motivated to face armed extremists, which in a number of occasions ends in police excesses and custodial deaths. These are few amongst many that are to be included in the new security policy. Therefore, it is essential to make amends to the police and other security forces to make it effective in addressing the people's need in a transparent and neutral manner. Co-ordination is essential between the security forces in order to face internal security threats.

# **Co-ordination Between the Centre and State**

It is arguably the lack of co-ordination which is the recurrent theme that magnifies threat situations. This affects the supply of , which is necessary for the functioning of the security apparatus of the state. Thus, the security policy needs to address this issue of lack in co-ordination and co-operation between the centre and the states.

# **lntelligence**

Intelligence it is one of the key components of internal security. Correct and timely intelligence is essential to keep in order both external and internal security threats. Without the backbone support of the intelligence, no mission can succeed. Intelligence of both forms, defensive and offensive, is needed to forewarn and to take proactive steps to the impending threats and to ensure that the situation is under control. A nodal agency is the need of the hour to collect, gather and effectively utilise all vital strategic information effectively, which contains any threat.

#### **Border Area Management**

Border area management is an emerging area. India has large and porous borders with neighbours. These regions are exploited by various insurgent groups from Kashmir and the northeast region, who hide in jungles across the border. There is huge trafficking of drugs, arms and ammunition since India is located in the

# **1.16 Chapter 1 • Introduction**

middle of the Golden Crescent and the Golden Triangle. The porous sea borders of India like the coasts of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu are conducive for smuggling. Complete co-ordination is necessary between various organisations and agencies to protect the border region. Co-ordination of the Navy, Coast Guard and the Marine Police is necessary for the effective management of sea routes. The Government of India has brought out a Coastal Security Scheme since 2010 to strengthen the coastal defence of the nation. The state police force is given responsibility of coastal defense.

# **Cyber Security Management**

Cyber space is considered the next ground of warfare, which is the most vital instrument to prevent or cause a threat. The proper cyber security policy is essential when we encounter the likes of the Edward Snowden issue. Threats come from anywhere and any form and cyber threat is one of the most distressing security threats. Thus, an effective security policy is needed, and the Department of Electronics and Information Technology has formulated the National Cyber Security Policy 2013 in the best interest of India.

# **Internal Policy Doctrine – Essential Aspects**

All these policy measures serve to protect the nation against the threats which could have an effect on internal functioning. Only an internal policy doctrine that covers the overall defence and security system is competent to manage the threat.

Each and every group has its own uniqueness and ideology, which makes it tedious to formulate an internal security doctrine. We can separate it into two categories, viz. the physical and the psychological.

- Physical:
  - ◊ military capability,
  - ◊ intelligence gathering,
  - ◊ good governance and
  - ◊ economic growth.
- Psychological:
  - ◊ readiness of the people to support the government in its initiatives and
  - ◊ ideological counter-measures.

#### **Physical Component**

#### *Military capabilities*

It is the capacity of the military to counteract the threat. It includes traditional military and internal security forces like the police, reserve police forces and other paramilitary forces. It is necessary to modernise these forces to counter escalating threats. They must also be motivated to deal with civilian population because without their support any counteracting measure will fail.

#### *Intelligence gathering*

Intelligence gathering is an important constituent in dealing with any sort of threat. Intelligence means information, which is useful and important. Thus, intelligence provides an insight in to dealing with insurgent activities. Counterintelligence measures entail military action and also help us analyse the ideology of anti-state movements and counter it effectively. Central intelligence agencies like the Intelligence Bureau and the State Police Intelligence are set up in India, and the key to fight terrorism is to collect accurate information and share it among stakeholders.

# *Good governance*

Good governance is necessary to counter the internal threat by involving grassroots organisations and civil society bodies. The voice of unheard populace will be heard only if concerns of grassroots people are addressed so that we can create an atmosphere of trust. Corruption, nepotism, etc. alienate people, and political and bureaucratic accountability is in question. Our security policy should address these governance lacunae so that these will not be the reason to wean away people to carry out anti-state activities.

#### *Economic growth*

Economics determines the status of people, their condition and the activities they carry out. Economic development and wealth distribution have a vital role in determining the internal security policy. Economic growth has not reached the targeted section of people; thus alienating the vast population. Such alienated people are swayed away easily to take up anti-national activities. The main reason for youngsters to join them is a lack of a job and a lack of their place in the economic ladder. Thus, when a government creates an internal security policy, it must not forget the inclusion of the implications of economic development.

# **Psychological Component**

#### *People's support of government initiatives*

The role of people is very vital that it should be considered in the security policy; else it is bound to fail. Without the support of civilians, any insurgent movement is short lived and can be easily shattered by the state. Enlisting civilian support is not a physical component; it is a psychological component as it involves the change in the mindset of the people. The effort of the government to secure civilian support is time consuming and can be achieved by providing them with the fruits of growth and good governance and employment. This effort of the government sensitises officials who deal with the people directly and ensure that they serve the public honestly. Winning the hearts and minds of the people is the beginning of ensuring support of the people towards government initiatives.

# **1.18 Chapter 1 • Introduction**

#### *Ideological countermeasures*

Anti-state movements have to be countered ideologically rather than adopting traditional counter-insurgency measures. This is considered as a minor component and generally does not have a special focus in the internal security doctrine. Strong state doctrines that counter Maoist ideology are necessary to completely eradicate anti-state movements like Left Wing Extremists. These measures can create a huge psychological impact on militants and civilians, who can be involved in the governance process and is the only way to growth and success.

## **Development and Spread of Extremism**

The enhancement of human capabilities and entitlements, which includes education, health, infrastructure and the liberty of people is termed 'development'. Therefore, development efforts should seek to improve human capabilities, knowledge and financial resources of the civilians thereby providing them with an opportunity to come out of poverty and deprivation and to lead a healthy, happy and honourable life.

The term extremism refers to the political or religious principle and actions of an extreme group that are unreasonable and unacceptable to most people. Extremists often condemn these with conflicting new points. The term extremist is subjective as one person's freedom fighter may be another's extremist.

Webster's English dictionary defines extremism as "belief in and support for ideas that are very far from what most people consider correct is reasonable."

There are time-immersed arguments on the relationship between development and extremism. They have a negative cyclical as the lack of development leads to extremism, extremism renders development efforts useless.

# **Underdevelopment and Extremism**

The lack of development in the country creates discontent among the people, which in turn leads to extremism. This discontent and violence have been steadily mounting despite the numerous statutory and institutional mechanisms in place to address poverty deprivation thereby ensuring development to sections of people who are not touched by the developmental efforts.

The second ARC identifies the following governance-related factors that have led to the growth of extremism:

- Corruption and poor, new provision of essential public services such as primary healthcare education, etc.
- Incompetent, ill trained and poorly motivated public personnel who are mostly absent from their place of posting.
- Misuse of power by the police and violations of the norms of law.
- Perversion of electoral politics and unsatisfactory working of local government institutions.

Poor and lack of proper socio-economic infrastructure among the tribal community is identified to be the main reason for their disempowerment.

A committee of concerned citizens in 1997 grouped the activities of Naxalites as strugglers of the rural poor and tribal people. It recognised it as a political struggle and not merely a law and order issue.

The above situations have therefore caused a feeling of alienation and anger among a large section of the population.

It is thus essential for the state to address these causes of anger and discontent in a human and democratic manner.

Underdevelopment has thus been a major cause of violence and extremism in the red corridors of the Naxal areas and northeastern states. It must be noted however that underdevelopment is not the cause of extremism and insurgence in Jammu and Kashmir. Historical and political factors are behind extremism in Jammu and Kashmir. But the extremism in these areas has continued to the underdevelopment of Jammu and Kashmir as with the northeastern states.
