# **inTroDucTion**

The security scenario in Jammu and Kashmir has drastically changed at present, right since the killing of Burhan Wani in 2016 by the armed forces. The repercussions of the incident can be felt even today and one of its long lasting and horrifying acts was the killing of 44 CRPF jawans by a suicide bomber in Pulwama by *Jaish-e-Mohammad* terrorists in February 2019.

Terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir is not new, what the difference at present is the new 'home-grown' terrorists movement. During the 1980's–1990's there was increased infiltration of terrorists from Pakistan and they received little or no support from the common people. Subsequently, due to various actions taken by the Indian state, the Pakistan's influence has been curtailed. After 2002 there was improvement in the situation and many commentators stated that it was end of militancy in Jammu and Kashmir. But, since the Burhan Wani incident, there can been seen increased terrorist activities, attacks on armed forces, local recruitment of militants which are much higher than the preceding years. There have

#### **12.2 Chapter 12 • Changed Security Situation in Jammu and Kashmir—The Road Ahead**

also been reports of increased infiltration from across the Line of Control (LoC) and local Kashmiri's support to them by providing them shelter. Several attacks have been carried out on the army posts, bases, convoys and several police and Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) posts were burnt down. During the end of 2016, Kashmir saw very disturbed law and order situation, especially in South Kashmir. This all culminated in the recent Pulwama attack.

There exists different understanding and perceptions regarding the Kashmir issue, one which is understood by the Indian state and the other perspective of common Kashmiri. This difference and contrast exist because of the mix of various factors—historical, social, political and geographical, which have been affecting the state.

Intense political movements and conflicts have been regular feature of the State for nearly 80 years. It all started in 1931 as a plural nationalistic and anti-feudal political movement against the existing power structure and now has transformed into narrow Islamic campaign leading to deaths and disappearances of almost fifty thousand people in the last 27 years. These years also saw the exodus of the Hindu Kashmiri Pandits who were the original inhabitants of the Kashmir valley. There was only a short, brief period of calm in which progress of the state could be made. Though it was one of the favourite tourist destination, it all changed and Kashmir valley is now considered to be dangerous and risky to visit.

The Kashmir issue is fraught with paradoxes. The Kashmiris fought against the intruders in 1947 and supported India, but thereafter post 1989, they gave open support and sheltered Pakistani militants. Soon afterwards, the Kashmiris withdrew their support to the militants and sense of calm prevailed for some years before seeing reversal post 2016.

As stated, there exists two different dimensions to the Kashmir issue one, the external factor—the Pakistan angle and the other, internal factor—what a common Kashmiri wants. These two aspects are discussed in order to identify the solution for the Kashmir conundrum.

# **The External Dimension**

The external dimension relates to Pakistan's interference in the Kashmir issue. India and Pakistan got partitioned based on the concept of two-nation theory, and Pakistan was created as a land for Muslims. Hence, the Muslim majority Kashmir came to be understood to naturally belong to Pakistan. This understanding of Kashmir is wrong as Kashmir followed a very different syncretic culture and mixed religious practice. Therefore, the identity of Kashmir was more ethnic than religious. The 'National Conference' the prominent political force in the state was launched by Sheik Abdullah, was initially named as 'Muslim Conference', but converted itself to 'National Conference' to represent the diverse population of the state. It had prominent leaders like Prem Nath Bazaz, Sardar Budh Singh and Pandit Sudama Sidha from the Hindu and Sikh communities.

The National Conference (NC) launched movement against the feudalistic and oppressive regime in Kashmir. NC's 'Quit Kashmir' movement paralleled the Indian National Congress's 'Quit India' movement against the British. The NC preferred joining 'multicultural secular' India which was closer to the multi ethnic society of Kashmir. Though Pakistan represented itself to be a land for Muslims, it did not share the identity of Kashmir and moreover it was dominated by semi-feudalistic powers.

Maharaja Hari Singh was advised to remain independent and not join either of the States. A standstill agreement was signed at the time of partition with Pakistan and proposed a similar one with India. Pakistan tried to force accession by cutting off the supply routes and sending the tribesmen from the North West Frontier Province (NWFP), on 26 October 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh signed instrument of accession with India and Jammu and Kashmir became part of the nation. Pakistan contested this, resulting in the first war between India and Pakistan. UN brokered peace and *status quo* was sought to be maintained and the state got split between India and Pakistan.

Thus, Kashmir remained centre of issue between India and Pakistan, more so for Pakistan. Pakistan's entire anti-India stance rests on Kashmir, and it has sought through various ways to wrest Kashmir from India. It has launched conventional wars, proxy wars, sent militants, *mujahideen*, to destabilize the state and cause disruptions.

The NC remained the popular party, and this can be seen from the fact that it won all 75 seats in the 1951 constituent assembly elections. Subsequently, even Sheik Abdullah sought to seek independence and feasibility of plebiscite. Hence, he was put under detention for 11 long years. The plebiscite issue was kept alive by formation of 'Plebiscite Front' by Mirza Afzal Beg, a close confidant of Sheik Abdullah. Such sentiments were stocked by Pakistan and it actively supported the separatists.

The claim to Pakistan based on religious grounds is far from the ground realities. Though Kashmir is a Muslim majority state, it practices Islam differently from that of Pakistan, this is a unique feature of the Kashmir identity. Kashmir has always followed a syncretic form of Islam having greatly influenced by Sufism. This blended culture called as *Kashmiriyat*, accepted all religious faith and practices. This posed hurdle to Pakistan which sought to break this fabric by promoting Saudi propagated fundamentalist *salafi-wahabi* version of Islam. This turned out have success, as it led to exodus of Kashmiri Hindu Pandits from the valley.

India too is accused of seeing Kashmir only from strategic and security perspective and it has failed to understand the aspirations of the people. The political resentment was underestimated by India, and this led to the Kashmiris supporting the militants from Pakistan. And, Pakistan too exploited this scenario by lending clandestine support to the separatist movement. The external and internal dimension got synced post 1987 elections which was considered to be rigged. Pakistan offered its support to the militant movement led by Jammu

#### **12.4 Chapter 12 • Changed Security Situation in Jammu and Kashmir—The Road Ahead**

Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) which sought for independence of Kashmir. Subsequently, Pakistan favoured *Hizbul Mujahideen* (HM) over JKLF. The HM was directly under the control of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan, and it came to be dominated by pro-Pakistan *Lashkar-e-Taiba.* Pakistan also lent its support to other terrorists' groups like *Jaish-e-Mohammad* (JeM), in order to destabilize and create confusion in India. Pakistan sought to deny its involvement in any Kashmir related organizations internationally, and it highlighted India's failure to protect its own people in Kashmir and increased clamping down of rights of Kashmiris.

All these led to alienation of Kashmiris from the movement supported by Pakistan. All the terrorist organizations came to be dominated by foreign fighters and this sought to erase the identity of Kashmiris. Apart from this, the *Jihad* supported by Pakistan was waning because, incapability of Pakistan to push terrorists across LoC, infighting among the cadres, diminishing cadre strength, and India Army's better management of the security situation. Thus, support to Pakistan was not entertained as it also ignored the aspiration of common Kashmiri, moreover, Pakistan's attempt to radicalize Kashmiris achieved little support. Assignation of moderates by the HM supported by the ISI pushed the Kashmiris further away. There still was some support to Pakistan from some quarters, but they were in minority.

The peace process initiated by Vajpayee and Musharraf though was path breaking, could not culminate into brining lasting solution to the Kashmir issue. Global war on terror supported by the USA and terrorism on its own soil diverted Pakistan's attention from the Kashmir issue. There were some intermittent cease fire violations, and attacks, which were also retaliated by India with equal force, the surgical strike in 2016 is one such incident.

The following are some of the real motives/objectives of Pakistan:

- The overall policy towards Kashmir is driven by its agenda of revenge for its failure to usurp Kashmir by force and being defeated in its attempts.
- Avenge its defeat in 1971 war and separate Kashmir out from India as Bangladesh was carved out.
- Achieve equality with India.
- To hold leverage on Kashmir for better gains of its natural resources.
- Obstruct India's growth by increasing her expenditure on the security.
- Keeping anti-India sentiments on the boil helps Pakistan to consolidate its identity. And it also helps the Pakistan army to maintain its grip on the country, enabling it to get perks and benefits for itself.
- Play the nuclear card to pressurize India into a settlement favourable to itself.
- Get support of China by fulfilling Chinese objective of keeping India unsettled.
- Internationalize Kashmir issue wherein populist movement is being forcefully suppressed by India.

- Get Kashmir by using the religious card, suppressing the Sufism and spreading fundamentalist Wahabi-Salafi philosophy. Ethnic cleansing has been undertaken by driving away of the Hindus from north of the Chenab river.
- Maintain relations with pro-Pakistan sympathizers and separatist elements in Kashmir.
- Suppress the voice of the moderates, blame their assassination on Indian security agencies.
- Instigate violence and sponsor terrorism. Suck as many Kashmiris as possible in this vortex, so that they feel victimized and perpetuate it.
- Promote agitations and protests in order to spread anarchy in Kashmir and achieve Kashmiri alienation.
- Limit options available for India and tie it down.

From the above, we can clearly see that none of this indicates its desire to resolve the Kashmir issue. Thus, Kashmir issue remains only and excuse to interfere with India, Kashmiris are used as fodder for carrying out Pakistan's strategic ambition.

# **Internal Dynamics in Jammu and Kashmir**

As stated earlier in 1947, the National Conference led by Sheikh Abdullah rejected the two-nation theory and supported accession to India. He termed the relationship with Indian National Congress to be 'Kinship of Ideals'. There was a 'negotiated relationship' with India and rejected relationship with the feudal Pakistan. Based on this negotiation, Kashmir acquired special status within the Indian federation in form of Article 370.

#### **1953: The Assertion of Indian Nationalism**

Sheikh Abdullah was the most popular leader of the masses, his arrest and detention sowed seeds of resentment. It led to the growth of the plebiscite movement. Bakshi Gulam Mohammad who replaced Sheikh Abdullah was considered to be a stooge of Delhi government. Though he brought in various reforms and changes, he was not accepted by the common Kashmiri. Hence, during the period of 1953–75 laid the foundation of the separatist politics in the state.

#### **1989: The Politics of Violence**

The years preceding 1989 were hugely disappointing for the people of Kashmir. The grievances built all these years came to a nadir. First incident was 1984 deposal of Farooq Abdullah as Chief Minister despite his huge electoral victory and installation of Ghulam Mohammad Shah in his place with support from Congress. Farooq later realized that support of Centre is essential for smooth functioning hence, signed the Farooq–Rajiv accord in 1987. This all led to build-up resentment among the masses. And it culminated in the 1987 'rigged

# **12.6 Chapter 12 • Changed Security Situation in Jammu and Kashmir—The Road Ahead**

elections'. This resulted in form of a mass armed militancy movement. With support from Pakistan this armed militancy movement grew for some years. It gained popular support of the people until the end of 1990s.

# **Peace Process 1999–2007**

Subsequent to the decline of militancy after 1990s free, fair, and peaceful state assembly elections have been conducted and people too have been participating in the electoral process in large numbers showing shift in the mindset of the people. Prime Minister Vajpayee led the peace initiative with Pakistan resulted in spread of calm in the valley. The people too welcomed such overtures. This was further build upon by Mufti Mohammad Sayeed (who became the Chief Minister after the 2002 elections), who started fresh initiatives known as the 'healing touch'. This process did tremendous good to building-up of the confidence of the people and helped in shaping environment towards ushering of peace.

These initiatives saw small but significant changes. School buildings occupied by the security forces were vacated, barricades were removed, increased scrutiny and accountability of security forces, disbandment and restrictions on Special Operations Group (SOG), etc. This period also saw initiation of Confidence Building Measures (CBM) with Pakistan. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh started series of Round Table Conferences (RTCs) (2006–07) with the separatists to address the internal issue comprehensively. The RTCs gave birth to five working groups, but they could not finish their agenda.

#### **2008–2013: Breakdown of Internal Peace Process and Emergence of Protests/Agitation Politics**

The security situation changed drastically after the protests in 2008 against allocation of 100 acres of forest land to the Amarnath Shrine Board. This split the state on religious lines, Jammu vs Kashmir because of the demographic distribution.

Year 2009 and 2010 saw even more agitations due of accusations of human right violations. Heavy stone pelting was carried out by the people, especially the youth was against the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the police. The resulting retaliatory fire saw increased deaths and fatalities. Number of youths were arrested and remanded. This led to raise in further discontent and their radicalization in the jail. These movements could not be termed political, rather they were emotional manifestations of grievances and against the Human Rights (HR) issues.

In order to calm and assuage the feelings of the people, the Government of India sent an All-Party delegation led by Home Minister in September 2010. Its recommendations resulted in eight-point political initiatives on Jammu and Kashmir, which included the appointment of interlocutors for continuing the dialogue process with all sections of the society on behalf of the Government of India. The interlocutors have submitted their report in 2011, but no further action has been taken on it as yet.

After 2010 the peace situation saw considerable improvement. The army became extremely cautious and zero tolerance approach towards human rights violations avoided further triggers. The 'Heart's approach' method of the army came under praise and it boosted its image among the common Kashmiri.

#### **Build-up to Present Situation**

The present disaffection has roots in all domains affecting lives in Kashmir political, sociocultural, religious and economic.

There is a prevailing sense of mistrust against the political parties with realization that they will do anything, including compromising their ideals to be in power. There is also political vacuum of opposition in the state after the formation of the government, hence separatists became the *de facto* rallying point for many.

Many of the youth who were arrested during stone pelting nurtured their grudge against the army and police. Unemployment was also an important reason for increased frustration of the youth. Tourism has been down because of the increased security tension and the floods of 2014.

At sociocultural and psychological level, the youth of Kashmir have seen countless violence and agitation all their lives. This has created a sense of fear and uneasiness in the society. Youth suffer from severe psychological trauma and nurture vengeance against the state and the security forces. There is also seen increase in suicide rates in Jammu and Kashmir. There is lack of optimism and effective means to pursue their goals. Number of provocations, and availability of radical content in the social media, combined with the idea of martyrdom in Islam serve as strong motivating factor for the youth to pick up guns. *Janaza* prayers of dead terrorists attract thousands, and this serves as a huge spiritual inspiration for the youth who seek to pick up the guns, as it is seen as transformational phenomenon which will change their status of being insignificant to becoming a local hero.

Several issues which were in the background gained prominence. The issue of state sovereignty gained support. Number of petitions and counterpetitions were filed regarding the issue of flying of state flag on par with the Indian flag, etc. The beef issue saw violence in the state as well as in the State Assembly.

In the militancy front, there has been increase in recruitment of locals into the terrorist cadres. According to Lt General Saha, 'Several motives are being exploited by recruiters, including religious radicalization, discontent due to personal or academic failures, links with terrorists and overground workers, and the desire for recognition or status.'

There has been participation of educated youth from affluent families in this new drive, this indicates that poverty is not the reason for their choice. These new age terrorists also resorted to post pictures and videos on Facebook and social media to cast a superhero image of themselves for others to emulate.

#### **12.8 Chapter 12 • Changed Security Situation in Jammu and Kashmir—The Road Ahead**

Though waving of Islamic State flag has been dismissed as mere posturing, but at the same time, both Al Qaida and IS are attempting to create constituencies in Jammu and Kashmir.

Also, worrisome aspect is the increase in number of disruptions and *bandhs*. There has also been increased civilian support for terrorists. It has been found that civilians are intervening in the police and military operations. Women too were found to be participating in these protests in large numbers.

There is renewed disaffection towards the mainstream politics. The separatist organizations have also gained ground in the last few years. After the protests in 2016, all the separatist factions have united and formed Unified Separatist Camp. The Burhan Wani's elimination was only a trigger point to the already deteriorated law and order situation.

# **Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan: Decoupled**

The basis of Pakistan's claim to Kashmir based on the two-nation theory has been broken after the formation of Bangladesh, moreover, there are equal number of Muslims in India as that in Pakistan. The plebiscite issue too is irrelevant as the first condition set by UN is the demilitarization of the territories which Pakistan has failed to carry out.

Pakistan also has only limited ethnic connect with people of Jammu and Kashmir. Minority groups present in Pakistan are protesting against the state's bias and indifferent treatment meted out to them. Violence against Shias, Baloch's, Ahmadiyya's, Muhajirs, Baltic's, Pashtun's, etc., is a regular occurrence in Pakistan. This fact is known by the people of Kashmir.

The law and order situation in Pakistan is also well-known to the outside world. There have been unquestioned extrajudicial killings, regular bomb blasts on the streets, mosques, schools, etc. Selective assignation of prominent people have been carried out. Moreover, Pakistan has also carried out assassination of moderates in Jammu and Kashmir and Kashmiris are aware about the fact that Kashmir's interest is not central to Pakistan.

After the Burhan Wani incident there has been surge in support of pro-Pakistani elements. This is not because of the optimism towards Pakistan, but rather because of the disdain against the Indian state and its security agencies. However, Pakistani elements are once again seeking to infiltrate militants to carry out attacks against army posts and police.

Though the ground support by the Kashmiris to Pakistan based militants eroded in the past decade, the same has to be assessed again keeping in mind the present context. To this extent, the Kashmir issue has to be coupled with that of Pakistan. The challenge, therefore, before the authorities is to address the internal domestic issues of Kashmir in order to remove the grievances, and build a favourable atmosphere to reduce the Pakistani support by the locals.

People too are tired of long drawn conflict and require peace. Many have sought to withdraw their support of *Hurriyat* and other separatist groups. Though they do not come in open, it is evident from the dwindling in number of supporters to call for *bandh* and protests by these elements.

There is little doubt that Kashmir issue has become a major problem because of the active support given by Pakistan to terrorism by supplying men, material, resources, training grounds and ideology. But over a period of time, this capability has reduced and now Pakistan's effort is restricted to firing across the LoC, suicidal missions by infiltrating militants to create sensationalism. But the support extended by the locals have drastically reduced. But Pakistan can still provide ideological support, internationalize the issues, and exploit the situation wherein the people of Kashmir turn towards it, because of resentment, frustration and alienation from India. The pacification of all these become primary Indian responsibility.

Thus, any measures to address the Kashmir issue through resolution of India-Pakistan relation, ignoring the internal dynamics within the state will be counterproductive. It is understood that, due to grievances towards Indian state, Pakistan might find more acceptance amongst the common people of Kashmir.

Therefore, the prudent way forward is to address the Jammu and Kashmir issue internally, decoupled with Pakistan. Relations with Pakistan can be carried out through a separate India-Pakistan policy.

#### **The Way Ahead**

Finding lasting solution to the Jammu and Kashmir issue has been one of the foremost governance challenges of independent India. Thus, managing relations with Pakistan has been one of the important thrust area from strategic perspective. Though the situation has been managed to a considerable degree, it has come at the cost of its people. Hence, permanent solution requires upscaling of the objective from that of conflict management to conflict resolution. It requires political will both from the Centre and State governments.

Some of the long-term measures for resolution of the issue are elaborated below:

#### **1. Decoupling Pakistan from Kashmir**

For effective resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir issue, it has to be decoupled from Pakistan. Pakistan's objectives go beyond the resolution of the Kashmir issue. Therefore, separation of the Kashmir issue from that of Pakistan is prudent strategy.

Pakistan has only limited powers to influence the Kashmir issue, and it can contribute only towards the militancy component. Even for this, support from local people is essential. Thus, the political issue of Kashmir is the larger challenge for India. Hence, there is urgent need to address these issues internally. More these internal issues are left unattended, the more Pakistan may find its interfering capabilities getting stronger.

#### **2. Addressing Kashmir Therapeutically**

It is understood that Kashmiris are sensitive people with peculiar psychology. Their trust has to be won, the way Vajpayee had won. This requires sincerity and commitment towards resolution of the problem.

The deep trauma suffered by the Kashmiris after 2016 has to be addressed and healed immediately. Families who have suffered death needs consolation. Businesses that were closed down require support to reopen and run again. An environment of acceptance needs to be created so as to address the situation at hand. The responsibility of bringing normalcy is the foremost duty of the state.

# **3. Political Matters and Personal Grievances**

Kashmir has always been understood to be a 'political problem'. But several decades of conflict has disturbed peace and affected the people both physically and psychologically. Hence, there requires two pronged issues to be addressed one, the larger political issue pertaining to the history, culture, identity and autonomy; and second, addressing the grievances of the people who have suffered for long years. Only, then they can be brought to mainstream and their sense of alienation can be removed.

#### *Political Matters*

There is little doubt that solution to Kashmir arises from political domain. The challenge is to achieve consensus in a multilayered society as Kashmir. It requires regular interaction among the political players without further polarizing the society.

There is also an understanding that smaller regional parties should have larger say in the coalition government, as they represent the aspirations of the people at the ground level. Moreover, they help to establish links between the people, State and Centre. A consensual approach is the best way forward. Long peaceful years will be helpful in winning over the population and bringing them to mainstream.

Forced nationalism of the Kashmiris has been opposed and finds no support and it will lead to further alienation of the people. Such short-term measures backfires rather than bringing solution to the issue. Hence, 'soft coalescence' as practiced by the PDP party should be followed and people have to be slowly nudged towards mainstream. Long-term peace and other measures will gradually make Kashmiris shift towards mainstream nationalism.

The autonomy issue can also be resolved by taking measures that fulfil aspirations of the Kashmiris as well as preserving the sovereignty of the country. Tampering with Article 370 is bound to raise conflict of interest. This should be relegated to the background so that actual issues come to the forefront. A declaration to this effect that Article 370 will not be tampered with has to be made to assure the people and settle down the issues.

Devolution of powers to the local bodies such as panchayats, municipal corporation, etc., can help in empowering of the people. Promoting self-governance will help a long way in achieving peace and control disaffection.

Giving space to political opposition and nurturing its growth will help to channelize discontentment and create a mature democratic force. A credible opposition is, therefore, desperately needed in order to defang separatists and politics of militancy.

#### *Personal Grievances: Assuaging Wounds*

This requires series of actions to be taken for reduction of violence to the extent possible, soft policing using non-lethal means for riot control, and establishing rule of law even in the remotest places.

There has to be greater sensitivity by the administration towards addressing the grievances of the people. Investigation into alleged human rights violations has be expedited. The guilty should be punished and the matters has to be given closure. Extending apology when required will help to assuage the wounds suffered by the people and will be a good way forward to reconcile with the people.

#### **4. Dialogue**

While speaking to the All-Party Delegation, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had stated that, 'I recognize that the key to the problem is political solution that addresses the alienation and emotional needs of the people. This can only be achieved through sustained internal and external dialogue.' Dialogue is the only forward to find a workable solution. Not all parties are welcoming the dialogue measures, especially the separatist camp who refuse to participate in the process. Such posing is only temporary and should be ignored and steps has to be taken to find a lasting solution through dialogue. It must be understood that, in absence of dialogue, the opposing forces resort to violence as means to express themselves.

#### **5. Administrative Measures**

Various administrative measures has to be undertaken for providing good governance. There has to be transparency in governance, central funds have to be properly utilized, infrastructure has to be built-up and several other measures need to be carried out. Corruption is a malaise and measures should be taken to address this concern. Focus should be providing good governance to areas which has hitherto not seen any governmental measures, such as the rural interiors and South Kashmir.

Employment has become a major concern in the state. The state has one of the largest proportion of government employees, yet, number of youth do not have any employment. Horticulture, the mainstay of Kashmir is also not productive because of the fall in number due to insecticide resistant strains. It requires research to address these concerns. Tourism too is affected because of the security concerns.

Discreet project can be undertaken to develop and rebuild one or two districts and villages and showcase them to be model townships. They can be builtup to be thriving centres of education, commercial activity and a hub for tourism. Such transformation can be emulated by other villages and districts.

#### **6. Youth**

Around 70 per cent of the population in Jammu and Kashmir is said to be under 35. This huge demographic dividend has remained unutilized. These youth like their counterparts in other states have participated and come out well in competitive examinations. But frequent *bandhs* and disruptions shatter their dreams, and bring confinement and uncertainty about their future. There is also prevailing sense of insecurity because of frequent checks and raids by security forces. Having brought up in an environment of violent militancy, security clamp downs, they have become psychologically hardened. They have grown suspicious of leaders and now display disregard and disobedience towards everyone.

What needs to be done, is to create opportunities for youth to grow, employment has to be created with push towards industrialization and entrepreneurship. If private investments are lacking, the government should push to open up Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs). More seats can be reserved for students from Jammu and Kashmir in institutions across the country. Being aware of the development all around, the youth will want to transform and change their lives and live on par with their peers.

#### **7. Return and Rehabilitation of Kashmiri Migrants**

The return and rehabilitation of the Kashmiri migrants are important to bring lasting solution to the Kashmir issue. A multipronged approach needs to be carried out involving various stakeholders to cater for security needs and living spaces for the migrants, and most importantly trust has to be built-up between the communities. Such measures of rehabilitation can only be successful if the communities repose faith in each other and in vision of a pluralistic society. This idea of harmony between diverse ethnic/religious communities has always been the essence of Kashmir, what they call as '*Kashmiriyat*'. Brining back of migrants will not only bring peace, but will also bring pluralistic culture back. This will also send out a message to other parts of the country that sense of normalcy has returned to the valley thereby boosting tourism and industrial growth in the state.

# **8. The Rejuvenation of Police Force**

Though the police are adept in dealing with the militants through force and other security measures, what is missing is the idea of 'soft policing'. This will create a sense of security among the people and will help to gain their trust. The police should take-up the mantle of leadership role, so as to inspire the people. Thus, police has to be trained to be sensitive to the needs of the people, inspire others, and be a leader. The army should be gradually withdrawn from the streets, and the police should be tasked with ensuring everyday security of the people. This will create a sense of normalcy to the people. The police should also be accounted for, and all their actions should be scrutinized. Extrajudicial acts should be shunned. All this will help in transformation of the police force in the state.

#### **9. Security Forces**

The Indian Army has contributed to the peace building of the state in an exemplary manner. They have effectively managed the situation for the past 25 years marring the recent internal disturbances. They have also carried out meaningful perception management through, '*sadbhavana* projects' which has to be emulated by the civil administration. But in long run, the visibility of the armed forces has to be reduced in order to create a sense of normalcy. The police has to be trained by the army to carry out their duties. The army can be confined and can be called upon in case of exigent conditions.

Thus, army can maintain *status quo* and concentrate of addressing the strategic security challenges. The army should also be made accountable and should not act in violation of human rights. The dilution of Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) is not recommended as it is considered to be a mandatory requirement for effective functioning of the forces in operation against the terrorists.

#### **10. Study Reports**

Several studies have been carried out by eminent scholars and experts. These reports carry many worthy solutions and measures, but they could not be implemented owing to various reasons. Hence, action has to be taken on these reports by making suitable modifications as necessary. The following are some of the important working groups and their chairperson:

- Confidence building measures across segments of society in the State: Hamid Ansari
- Strengthening relations across the Line of Control: M. K. Rasgotra
- Economic development: C. Rangarajan
- Ensuring good governance: N. C. Saxena
- Strengthening relations between the State and the Centre: Saghir Ahmad

Appropriate implementation of the recommendations made in these reports is essential and much needed.

The team of interlocutors (appointed by Centre in 2010) consisting of journalist Dileep Padgaonkar, former Information Commissioner M. M. Ansari, and academician Radha Kumar came up with a comprehensive report after carrying out detailed interaction with cross-section of the people, with more than 700 delegations held in all 22 districts. The report was titled, 'A New Compact with the People of Jammu and Kashmir', and it was aimed at 'permanent political settlement of the Kashmir problem'. It addresses all the three components—political, economic and sociocultural into a one single package. It was submitted to the Home Minister in October 2011. But no actions has been taken for want of political consensus. Hence, what is needed at present is political will to implement these recommendations with due modifications expeditiously.

# **Conclusion**

More and more people have been affected by the vortex violence arising from the political agitations/militant violence and state's efforts to attain sovereignty. The vicious cycle of violence continued resulting in increased grievance of people and this leading to more protests and agitations perpetuating the cycle of violence. The new generation of Kashmiris have not benefitted from the growth and development as in rest of the country. They are unemployed and seething with rage because of impression of bias by the country. This has led the youth to take-up arms against the country, and those who do not join militancy, nurture hatred within.

The new low in security situation after the Pulwama attack is set to make matters worse. Such large-scale attack was not detected in time, leading to claim of intelligence failure. Moreover, such an attack would not have been possible without the support from the local Kashmiris. Hence, such incidents will once again prompt the Centre to take security action ignoring the simmering discontent within the people of Kashmir. Any such security action can only be temporary as without addressing the concern of the people, such incidents is still likely to occur in future. Moreover, increased clampdowns and security checks will increase the tension. Though, there is a Pakistan angle to this issue, the country has to look beyond and address actual concerns of the people in order to bring a lasting solution.

Hence, there is need to decouple Pakistan from issues concerned Jammu and Kashmir. And the primary reason attributed to the prevailing conundrum is essentially internal. The prudent way forward is thus, to identify and resolve such issues. Indian state should therefore, make a strong compact with the people of Jammu and Kashmir, and take ownership of resolving the dispute on its own.

The persistence of the issue in Jammu and Kashmir will also affect the stature of India in international stage and will be difficult to take-up leadership roles without addressing/resolving its own internal issues. A better way forward is to bring the Jammu and Kashmir to the national mainstream by widening its scope as Prime Minister Vajpayee sought to do. And this requires Kashmiris to repose faith in India's genuine intentions.
