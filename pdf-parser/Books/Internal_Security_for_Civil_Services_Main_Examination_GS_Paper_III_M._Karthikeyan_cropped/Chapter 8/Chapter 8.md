Money making is the main reason for indulging in criminal activities. The handling of money in such cases, especially large amount poses problem. Moreover, it can even lead to getting caught by the law enforcement agencies. Thus, 'Money Laundering' is the process by which the money obtained from criminal activities, such as, illegal arms sales, extortion, drug trafficking, gambling, bootlegging, smuggling etc., is brought into the financial system by masking and concealing the origin of the money, that is, concealing its illicit origin and make it appear coming from legal source.

# **DeFInItIons**

Various international organizations have dealt with the phenomenon of money laundering and have sought to define it. The following are some of the definitions which will through light on various perspectives:

**1. United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffi c in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988) (Vienna Convention):** 'The conversion or transfer of property, known that such property is derived from any (drug traffi cking) offence or offences of form an act of participation in

# **8.2 Chapter 8 • Money Laundering**

such offence or offences, for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property of assisting any person who is involved in the commission of such an offence or offences to evade the legal consequences of his actions.

 The concealment or disguise of the true nature, source, location, disposition, movement, rights with respect to, or ownership of property, knowing that such property is derived from an offence or offences or from act of participation in such an offence or offences.

 The acquisition, possession or use of property knowing at the time of receipt that such property was derived from an offence or offences or from an act of participation in such offence or offences'.

- **2. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime:** Money laundering is the method by which criminal disguise the illegal origins of their wealth and protect their asset bases, so as to avoid the suspicion of law enforcement agencies and prevent leaving a trail of incriminating evidence'.
- **3. IMF:** 'Money laundering is the process by which proceeds from a criminal activity are disguised to conceal their illicit origin'.
- **4. Financial Action Task Force:** 'The goal of large number of criminal acts is to generate a profit for the individual or group that carries out the act. Money laundering is the processing of these criminal proceeds to disguise their illegal origin'.
- **5. Interpol:** Any act or attempted act to conceal or disguise the identity of illegally obtained proceeds so that they appear to have originated from legitimate sources.

# **Impact on global economy**

- **1. Cause of Concern**: The major concern of the money laundering arises from its connection with the criminal activities. The entering of illegal money *per se* in itself is not the cause of concern, rather, the issue lies in the negative effect this is likely to have on the society. Money laundering provides avenue for the criminals to convert their illegal assets to legal form and thereby use their surplus funds in legal avenues which otherwise would have remain idle or spent in luxurious endeavours. Hence, it will have farreaching effects—economic, political and social.
- **2. Economic Effects:** The unrestricted and unchecked conversion of illegal money to legal would have adverse effect on the economy. It would create unfair competition between honest and dishonest businesses. This will lead to unfair advantage to the dishonest businesses. Also, it will lead to

distortion of prices and ultimately have impact on the economic growth. Illegal inflow of money will make the money supply unpredictable thus making the monetary management of the economic situation difficult. Such cross-border movement of illegal money will increase the volatility of the international capital and have impact on the exchange rates.

- **3. Social Effects:** Corruption and organized crimes are two most important concerns of almost all the countries. Money laundering helps camouflage illgotten wealth of corrupt individuals. It helps in perpetration and structuring of the organized crimes. Thus, in places where there is lag in control of money laundering, it leads to increase in corruption and financial frauds. Moreover, such places will act as safe-haven for criminals leading to more detrimental effect on their social environment.
- **4. Political Effects:** Increase in clout of criminal elements in places where money laundering is prevalent will lead them to influence the social and political systems. And in time, they will gain control over the socio-political system of the country and ultimately will lead to degradation of the democratic system.

# **Terrorism Financing**

Terrorism financing means that deliberately mobilizing or collecting funds in order to support terrorist acts or organization. This funding can arise from both legitimate and illegal sources. In this process the terrorist financers conceal both the origin/source of finance and the activity for which it is used. There is no fixed amount to finance terrorist acts or organizations, however such organization requires substantial amount of money to run, maintain and sustain them.

# **Definition**

As per the UN's International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (1999).

Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this convention if that person by any means, directly or indirectly, unlawfully and willingly, provides or collects funds with the intention that they should be sued or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part in order to carry out:

- (a) An act which constitutes an offence within the scope of and as defined in one of the treaties listed in the annex; or
- (b) Any other act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking any active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing an act.

# **8.4 Chapter 8 • Money Laundering**

For an act to constitute an offence set forth above, it shall not be necessary that the funds were actually used to carry out an offence referred to in (a) or (b).

# **Difference in Perspective**

The major issue is that not all countries have adopted the convention defining what constitutes terrorism, and there is no universally accepted meaning for terrorism because of political, religious and national inclinations which differ from country to country.

# **Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing**

These two are difference phenomenon. In money laundering the source is illegal and hidden, while the use of these funds becomes legal; whereas in terrorism financing the source of funds might be either legal or illegal, but these are used for perpetrating terrorist activities and sought to be concealed. In both the cases there is illegitimate use of the financial sector to conceal the funds. The methods/techniques used to launder money is similar to those used to conceal the source and uses of terrorist financing. Thus, steps taken to prevent money laundering will also help to detect and deter terrorism finance related activities.

# **Methods of Money Laundering**

The process of money laundering is accomplished in three ways:

- 1. Placement
- 2. Layering
- 3. Integration

![](_page_3_Figure_11.jpeg)

These phases occur either distinctly in phases or in overlapping manner. The money which is laundered undergoes the above steps and various methods or their variants to complete the money laundering sequence. Moreover, the use of methods depends also on the type of control whether weak or non-existent. Thus, the financial heavens offer host of services to foreign investors who want anonymity to stash their unaccounted wealth.

#### **Placement**

This step is where the cash is physically disposed in bulk. The cash is taken away from the place of collection and taken to place where it could be disguised and is placed into formal or informal financial institutions or into retail sector or taken out of the country.

#### *Role of Formal Financial Institutions*

The formal financial institutions such as the banks and other institutions play important role in transmitting the money involved in the money laundering process. Depositing of the money in such institutions is a very important step in the money laundering sequence. In order to curb this practice, the legal systems specify reporting of cash transaction over and above some threshold limit and reporting of suspicious transactions.

#### *Smurfing*

In order to evade the check instituted by the legal systems, the money launderers mask the deposits by breaking them into smaller deposits which is smaller than the threshold limit. This process is known as smurfing. Through this method, the individual cash reporting can be avoided as the cash transacted is lesser than the reporting value.

The next step in the money laundering process is the depositing of the money in such accounts which provide protection. This kind of protection is present where the beneficial owners of the company need not be disclosed in the country where it has headquarters, hence deposits can be made into such accounts. Deposits can also be made in the trusts, which can be e-operated by the trustees without disclosing who the beneficiaries are, or the deposits can also be made in the name of clients of the members of legal profession to whom the rules of attorney confidentiality may apply. Even if identity disclosure is present, the corrupt bank officials may collude with the money launderers and accept deposits by creating false identities.

#### *Currency Smuggling*

The above said smurfing process in reality is cumbersome as it involves numerous transactions to be made in smaller denominations. Also, if there is an effective system to detect suspicious bank transactions, the money launderer would not prefer the banking route to send the cash for the laundering purpose. In such cases, the money would be smuggled from a well-regulated country to a country having ineffective regulation, and the money is deposited in financial institutions of such countries from where it will be transferred to the desired country. Such transactions involving trillions of dollars are made every day and thus the launderers can escape detection from the law enforcement agencies. The currency can be smuggled though air, land, sea and mail. The smuggling of currency through air is preferred as it is faster and the carrier can be close to the money.

#### *Role of Informal Financial Institutions*

The informal financial are also utilized in the money laundering process. Through currency exchanges and money services, the money launderer buys foreign currency which can be then transported out of the country. Wire services can help transfer money outside the country to other accounts. Other institutions such as the commodities broker, securities broker, gold/silver and other precious metal brokers/dealers, casinos, etc., use money launderers. Informal set-up such as informal bankers, including that of *hawala* or hundi is used to launder money which comes from criminal activities.

#### *Hawala*

This is an alternate form of remittance system which is popular in countries such as India and Pakistan. The term *hundi* is also used interchangeably. This process is also known as chop shop and chiti banking. *Hawala* is a means of transfer of money which is based on trust or reference. Generally, the charges for transferring money under *hawala* is much lower than the normal bank charges. The broker or dealer is called as the *hawaladar*. This system includes addition or transfer of money by manipulating the invoices to conceal the movement of money in shipment of goods and also in smuggling of gold security dues.

The process of money transfer is simple, if anyone from country A intends to send money to someone in country B, he is required to pay the required money and a commission to the *hawaladar* in country A. The *hawaladar* then sends a message to his associate *hawaladar* in country B to deliver the money. The *hawaladar* then sends the required amount to the person in country B.

The settlement of dues between *hawaladars* is carried out by way of double invoicing. This is carried out as follows, the *hawaladar* in country A may buy items of export worth ` 10,00,000. He would send these items to the *hawaladar* in country B with an invoice of ` 5,00,000. The *hawaladar* in country B then sells the goods worth ` 10,00,000 and sends ` 5,00,000 back to the *hawaladar* in country A and thus retains ` 5,00,000 towards *hawala* payments. Similarly, over invoicing is also carried out to settle dues between the *hawaladars*.

The system of *hawala* is said to facilitate the criminal activities because of its anonymity, speed and absence of paper trail. Thus criminals, drug traffickers, corrupt officials and politicians use this method to transfer their wealth for laundering purpose.

#### *Other Methods of Placement*

The money launderers take over cash transaction business such as hotels, exchange bureaus, casinos, which has huge cash inflow. They then mix the proceeds of crime, by including them in the receipts of business and thereby showing them to be legitimate return from business.

In the method of refining, smaller denomination bills are exchanged for larger ones and then converted at number of different banks to avoid detection.

# **Layering**

In this process, the proceeds of crime are separated from their source by creating a complex layer of financial transactions which are deliberately designed to morph the audit trail of illicit money. Such complicated layers of transaction will make the traceability extremely difficult by the enforcement agencies. 'Megabyte Money' which are in form of computer-generated symbols operate 24 hours a day, and will be shifted numerous times to avoid detection by the agencies.

# *Monetary Instruments*

Once the proceeds of crime are successfully places, they are then converted into financial instruments such as bonds, money orders, traveller's cheques and stocks. These forms are easy to transport them out from the country of origin.

# *Electronic Funds Transfer or Wire Transfer*

This is one of the important layering methods used by the launderers as it has minimal audit trail, anonymity and speed, etc.

#### *Asset Purchase*

High values assets such as cars, boats, gold, art works etc., are purchased and re-sold either domestically or exported and proceeds from these are obtained in non-cash form.

#### *Corporate Techniques*

Offshore front corporations which are generally licensed to conduct business only outside the country of incorporation are obtained by the launderers. These corporations are exempt from tax and other regulatory obligations and are protected by secrecy laws. Bank accounts are opened in the safe heavens in name of such corporations and proceeds of crime are deposited in them. They are thus, free from regulatory obligation and are protected by secrecy laws. Thus, protected by corporate secrecy and banking secrecy provisions, the proceeds from the crime can be used as payment as load for the criminal himself or can be used for other investments or transfer which mask the illegal nature of the origin of such money.

#### **Integration**

The illegally obtained money is given stamp of recognition and this money re-enters economy in form of normal business earning.

#### *Sham Loans from Front Companies—Offshore Haves and Bank Secrecy*

By this method, paper works for load or mortgage are created. The launderer then obtains a sham loan from the front company which is usually incorporated in tax haven countries. This, therefore, creates an image that the loan obtained

#### **8.8 Chapter 8 • Money Laundering**

by the criminal is legitimate. The front company has been incorporated with the laundered money and it runs to launder and legitimize the money. The launderers also avail benefits such as income tax benefits, tax holiday, etc. Money is also transferred from one country, in offshore heaven to destination country, these banks are referred as 'off shore shelf banks' and these are also established and managed by the launderers or their agents.

Countries such as Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Antilles, Cyprus, Hong Kong, etc., are regarded to be offshore heavens.

#### *Real Estate Transactions*

Properties are bought in the name of the front companies from the laundered money and then sold, the proceeds of such sale are given the colour of legitimacy as being legitimate proceeds of business.

#### *Value Tampering*

This is a method by which the money launderer received property from the owner for lesser price and pays the difference in form of cash and thereafter sells the same for higher value. For example, the property worth 20 lakhs is bought on papers for 10 lakh and the difference of 10 lakh is paid as cash and thereafter the launderer sells the property for 20 lakh or for higher value and shows the entire amount received to be legitimate.

#### *Double Invoicing*

The price of goods shown in the invoice is manipulated. The difference in actual price of goods are deposited in the country where the goods are received and then it is repatriated. Various techniques, such as over-invoicing, under-invoicing, etc., are used by the operators.

# **Adverse Effects of Money Laundering**

The following are some of the adverse effects of money laundering:

- It can weaken the social fabric and collective ethical standards.
- It can destabilize the financial system and weaken the development efforts taken in the emerging markets.
- It can pose challenge to the economic system by changing the demand for cash, making the interest and exchange rates more volatile, cause inflation, etc.
- Flow of illegal unaccounted money from the economies cause instability and threat to the global market.
- It empowers and supports corruption and organized criminal activities.
- The origin or the source of the money is disguised by the criminals and are used to obtain assets, properties and make investments in other forums. Steps are taken to conceal the source of such money thereby, raising no suspicion when it is used.
- The globalization has helped criminals quickly transfer money across the countries. Thus, development of technology has resulted in quick and speedy transfer of criminal wealth across nations. This, thus, has led to financial crunch.
- Financial secrecy in some jurisdiction has helped the launderers to convert the ill-gotten wealth as legitimate source of money and bring it back into the system. Thus, banking and financial secrecy pose hurdle for curbing the money laundering activities.
- The money which is laundered is utilized once again by the criminal elements to increase their power and reach. They now legitimately buy assets and properties and create unfair competition in the market.
- It is estimated that the money laundering transaction involves around 2 to 5 per cent of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Thus, it is increasingly realized that money laundering is a crime and steps are being taken to counter it and to confiscate the proceeds of crime from the criminals.

# **Need for Combating Money Laundering**

The proceeds of the crime are liable for seizure and confiscation, and when seized and produced by the enforcement agency, it would be taken as admissible evidence and strengthen the prosecution case against the criminals. The international initiatives such as signing of the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988 and the Convention of Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime, opened for signature on 8 November 1990 referred to as the 'Strasbourg Convention', obligated other legal systems to enact laws for confiscation of proceeds of crime.

#### **8.10 Chapter 8 • Money Laundering**

Since, the criminal proceeds were also confiscated, the criminals started using the money laundering methods to disguise the proceeds of the crime. Thus, the illegal profits of the criminals are masked and they are brought back as legitimate source and are ploughed back into the system. Money laundering methods are used in criminal activities that generate significant amount of profit, such as trafficking of women, children, body parts, corruption, arms smuggling, other white-collar crimes, etc.

The important issue in money laundering is that everything is kept secret. The evidence in this crime is the 'money trail' left behind by the launderers, these are generally intricate and often complex, the launderers design it to make them seem legitimate, and in many cases, it is difficult to distinguish the crime from the money laundering process. The present technological advancement in the e-commerce sector where paper trail is kept minimum act as another hurdle in curbing the money laundering activities.

The international tax havens are generally used by the launderers as they have lax laws and provide adequate protection and secrecy to their actions. Thus, money laundering is carried out in comparatively easier manner. Thus, criminals move out their proceeds of crime to other jurisdiction, thus, the problem of money laundering has taken global perspective and is carried out internationally across continents.

Money laundering problem was initially thought to be the problem of the West especially in countries such as USA where large amount of drug-related money is laundered. Development of technology and internet has given the launderers power to penetrate into financial sector of any jurisdiction with ease. Lightning speed cash transactions, high value cards, make transfer of money simple and easier. The money laundering thus, uses both the formal financial institutions and non-financial institutions for changing the character of the proceeds of crime. Thus, in order to curb this practice, the countries have to develop ways which are both preventive and punitive.

## **Global Initiatives**

There is increasing awareness around the globe about the negative fallout and international ramifications of the money laundering activities. Hence, international level cooperation and initiatives are required to combat such activities. The United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988, was the first major international efforts against laundering of proceeds of crime generated from illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. This was followed by establishment of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) by G-7 countries in their 15th Economic Summit held in Paris on 16 July 1989. FATF was established to promote development of effective anti-money laundering controls and to encourage cooperation to counter-money laundering efforts around the world. The first report on the FATF was published in April 1990, which contained 40 recommendations to counter money laundering. These recommendations are comprehensive strategies which the governments of every country have to initiative to counter money laundering.

# **Financial Action Task Force**

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an intergovernmental body established in 1989 by the Ministers of its member jurisdictions. The mandate of the FATF is to set standards and to promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation, and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. In collaboration with other international stakeholders, the FATF also works to identify national-level vulnerabilities with the aim of protecting the international financial system from misuse.

The FATF recommendations set out a comprehensive and consistent framework of measures which countries should implement in order to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, as well as the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Countries have diverse legal, administrative and operational frameworks and different financial systems, and so cannot take all identical measures to counter these threats. The FATF recommendations, therefore, set an international standard, which countries should implement through measures adapted to their particular circumstances. The FATF recommendations set out the essential measures that countries should have in place to:

- Identify the risks, and develop policies and domestic coordination.
- Pursue money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation.
- Apply preventive measures for the financial sector and other designated sectors.
- Establish powers and responsibilities for the competent authorities (e.g., investigative, law enforcement and supervisory authorities) and other institutional measures.
- Enhance the transparency and availability of beneficial ownership information of legal persons and arrangements.
- Facilitate international cooperation.

# **Extent of Problem of Money Laundering in India**

It does have a huge problem of the black economy. This is unaccounted and holders of black money launder it back to acquire legitimate assets. Such kind of legal or illegal income which evades the formal system in order to avoid tax burden constitutes the unreported Gross Domestic Product or the black economy. There is a minute difference between laundering the black money and laundering the proceeds of crime, in the former the source of income might be legitimate and money is laundered in order to evade payment of tax, whereas in the latter, the income generated is from illegal and unlawful sources such as criminal activities.

In Ram Jethmalani vs Union of India, it was stated by the petitioners before the Supreme Court that there had been a slew of reports, in the media, and also in scholarly publication that various individuals, mostly citizens, but may also include non-citizens, and other entities with presence in India, have generated, and secreted away large sums of monies, through their activities in India or

#### **8.14 Chapter 8 • Money Laundering**

relating to India, in various foreign banks, especially in tax havens, and jurisdictions that have strong secrecy laws with respect to the contents of bank accounts and the identities of individuals holding such accounts. The petitioners alleged that most of such monies were unaccounted, and in all probability had been generated through unlawful activities, whether in India or outside India, but relating to India. The petitioners contended that the sheer volume of such monies point to grave weakness in the governance of the nation, because they indicate a significant lack of control over unlawful activities through which such monies are generated, evasion of taxes, and use of unlawful means to transfer of funds. That these funds were then laundered and brought back to India, to be used in both legal and illegal activities. That the use of various unlawful modes of transfer of funds across borders, gave support to such unlawful networks of international finance. That inasmuch as such unlawful networks were widely acknowledged to also effectuate transfer of funds across borders in aid of various crimes committed against persons and the State, including but not limited to activities that might be classifiable as terrorist, extremist, or unlawful narcotic trade, the prevailing situation also had very serious connotations for the security and integrity of India. The petitioners further contended that a significant part of such large unaccounted monies included the monies of powerful persons in India, and its agencies, had been very lax in terms of keeping an eye on the various unlawful activities generating unaccounted monies, the consequent tax evasion; and that such laxity extended to efforts to curtail flow of such finds out, and into, India.

Thus, money laundering pose serious threat to India and number of steps are being taken to curb and curtail this practice.

#### **High Profile Money Laundering Cases in India**

The following are some of the high-profile money laundering cases in India:

• **Commonwealth Games Scam 2010: 70,000 Crore Scam**

It is estimated that out of 70,000 crore spent on the Games, only half of the said amount was spent on Indian sportspersons. Discrepancies in tenders-like payment to non-existent parties, willful delays in execution of contracts, overinflated price and bungling in purchase of equipment through tendering, and misappropriation of funds.

# • **Group Financial Scandal 2013: A 4000 Crore Scam**

Financial scam caused by the collapse of a Ponzi Scheme run by Saradha Group, a consortium of over 200 private companies that were believed to be running collective investment schemes popularly but incorrectly referred to as chit funds.

# • **Indian Coal Allocation Scam 2012: 185,591 Crore Scam**

Private companies got coal blocks allotted, not auctioned, leading to estimated losses as per the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. Supreme Court canceled all 214 coal blocks allocations since 1993. Government to e-auction the coal blocks now.

# • **2G Scam 2008: 176,000 Crore Scam**

Many telecommunications company's communication bandwidths auctioned for lower than market value. A. Raja and M. K. Kanimozhi have been in Tihar Jail for 15 months and five months respectively.

# • **Shabir Shah**

The Enforcement Directorate Filed charge sheet against Kashmiri separatist leader Shabir Shah as he generated funds from Pakistan and other countries to carry out unrest in the Valley.

# • **Zakir Naik**

Mr Naik's fundamentalist approach to religion has long been controversial.

 Many detained Al-Qaeda followers have reportedly told officials that he has a huge influence on them. He was banned from entering the UK in 2010 for 'unacceptable behaviour', and because of his speeches, by then home secretary (and now Prime Minister) Theresa May.

 In November 2016, India's counterterrorism agency filed an official complaint against Mr Naik, accusing him of promoting religious hatred and unlawful activity. Mr Naik moved to Malaysia in 2017. India's Enforcement Directorate (ED), filed the charges against Mr Naik in court.

# **Prevention of Money Laundering—Indian Initiatives**

In India, before the enactment of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) the major statutes that incorporated measures to address the problem of money laundering were:

- The Income Tax Act, 1961
- The Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA)
- The Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators Act, 1976 (SAFEMA)
- The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPSA)
- The *Benami* Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988
- The Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988
- The Foreign Exchange Management Act, 2000, (FEMA)

#### **Prevention of Money Laundering Act**

The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 was enacted to prevent money laundering and provide for confiscation of property derived from, or involved in, money laundering and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The Act also addressed international obligations under the Political Declaration and Global Programme of Action adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations to prevent money laundering.

#### **8.16 Chapter 8 • Money Laundering**

To strengthen the provisions of the PMLA, amendments were carried out in 2009. These amendments have introduced new definitions to clarify and strengthen the Act and strengthened provisions related to attachment of property involved in money laundering and its seizure and confiscation. More offences have been added in Parts A and B of the Schedule to the Act, including those pertaining to insider trading and market manipulation as well as smuggling of antiques, terrorism funding, human trafficking other than prostitution, and a wider range of environmental crimes. A new category of offences with crossborder implications has been introduced as Part C.

The problem of black money is no longer restricted to the geopolitical boundaries of any country. It has become a global menace that cannot be contained by any nation alone. In view of this, India has become a member of the FATF and APG on Money Laundering, which are committed to the effective implementation and enforcement of internationally accepted standards against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Consequent to the submission of an action plan to the FATF for bringing India's anti-money laundering legislation on par with international standards and to address some of the deficiencies of the Act that have been experienced by the implementing agencies, PMLA 2002 is further proposed to be amended through the Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Bill 2011, which is under consideration of Parliament. The Bill seeks to introduce the concept of 'corresponding law' to link the provisions of Indian law with the laws of foreign countries and provide for transfer of the proceeds of the foreign predicate offence in any manner in India. It also proposes to enlarge the definition of the offence of money laundering to include therein activities like concealment, acquisition, possession, and use of proceeds of crime as criminal activities and remove the existing limit of `5 lakhs for imposition of fine under the Act. It also strengthens provisions for attachment and confiscation of the proceeds of crime and widens the investigative powers of the Director and clubs' offences listed under Schedules A and B into a single Schedule.

## **The Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Act, 2015**

The Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Act, 2015, has been brought in as a comprehensive measure to deal with black money stashed away and to deter people from parking unaccounted money overseas. It provides for separate taxation of any undisclosed income through foreign sources and assets. With this law in place, foreign income will no longer be administered under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

#### **Important Provisions of the Act**

• The Act will apply to all person resident in India and will apply to both undisclosed foreign income and assets.

- Undisclosed foreign income or assets shall be taxed at a flat rate of 30 per cent.

#### **Amendment to Prevention of Money Laundering Act**

• The Act also includes the offence of tax evasion as a scheduled offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.

#### **Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016**

The Government of India brought a new law in August 2016 in order to curb the practice of buying property through *benami* deals. The law came into effect since November 2016 and prohibits *benami* transactions, with 7 years of imprisonment and stringent penalties for those who indulge in the activity.

#### **What Is Benami?**

*Benami* in essence means property without a name. Here, the person who intends to buy the property buys it under a third person's name, so as to avoid whose name the property is purchased is called the *benamidar*, and the property is referred to as *benami* property. The *benamidar* would only be a titular holder, while the person financing the deal could be the sole exploiter of the returns that arise from that property.

There are many kinds of assets that are considered for the purpose of this law—movable, immovable, tangible, intangible, any right or interest in a company or legal documents; even gold or financial securities can qualify to be *benami* properties.

#### **Amendments**

The amendment adds other transactions which qualify as *benami*, such as property transactions where: (i) the owner is not aware or denies knowledge of the ownership of the property, (ii) transaction is made in a fictitious name and (iii) person providing the consideration for the property is not traceable.

According to the new law, people caught with *benami* properties could serve up to seven years of rigorous imprisonment and have to pay a significant fine. Additionally, the properties will be confiscated. Under the Act, a transaction is named *benami* if property is held by one person but has been provided or paid for by another person.

The Act provides for the creation of an appellate mechanism called the Adjudicating Authority and Appellate Tribunal.

# **Anti-Money Laundering Standards**

RBI issued Master Circular on Know Your Customer (KYC) norms/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards/Combating of Financing of Terrorism (CFT)/Obligation of banks under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 and Banks were advised to follow certain customer identification procedure for opening of accounts and monitoring transactions of a suspicious nature for the purpose of reporting it to appropriate authority. These 'Know Your Customer' (KYC) guidelines have been revisited in the context of the recommendations made by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards and on Combating Financing of Terrorism

#### **8.20 Chapter 8 • Money Laundering**

(CFT). Detailed guidelines based on the recommendations of FATF and the paper issued on Customer Due Diligence (CDD) for banks by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), with suggestions wherever considered necessary, have been issued. Banks/FIs have been advised to ensure that a proper policy framework on 'Know Your Customer' and Anti-Money Laundering measures is formulated and put in place with the approval of their Boards.

The objective of the KYC norms/AML measures/CFT guidelines is toward prevent the banks from being manipulated either intentionally or unintentionally by the criminal elements for carrying out money laundering or terrorism financing activities. These procedures also enable banks to under their customer and carry out financial dealings in a better manner and help manage risks effectively.

Apart from these the following institutions play significant role in curbing the money laundering activities,

#### **Enforcement Directorate**

The ED was established in 1956 to administer the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 1973 (FERA). However, FERA was repealed on 31 May 2000 and replaced with the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999 (FEMA) which came into force with effect from 1 June 2000.

The ED has currently been entrusted with the investigation and prosecution of money laundering offences and attachment/confiscation of the proceeds of crime under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002 (PMLA). The officers of the ED undertake multifaceted functions of collection, collation and development of intelligence, investigation into suspected cases of money laundering, attachment/confiscation of assets acquired through the commission of scheduled offences, and the criminal prosecution of the offenders in the court of law. The ED also enforces the provisions of FEMA, aimed at promoting the development and maintenance of India's foreign exchange market and providing, *inter alia*, for action against persons/entities involved in international *hawala* transactions.

The ED also administers the PMLA. The PMLA contains provisions related to investigation into the cases of money laundering and powers of search, seizure, collection of evidence, prosecution, etc., for which the ED is the competent authority. Under the PMLA, 'money laundering' is a criminal offence and extends to any property derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence (as per Annexure-1). After a 2009 amendment, predicate offences for money laundering also extend to conduct that occurred in another country which constitutes an offence in that country and which would have constituted a predicate offence had it occurred domestically. The ED initiates investigations only after a law enforcement agency registers a case under any one of the offences listed in the Schedule to the Act.

#### **Financial Intelligence Unit**

The FIU-IND was established by the Government of India vide an Office Memorandum dated 18 November 2004 for coordinating and strengthening efforts for national and international intelligence by investigation and enforcement agencies in combating money laundering and terrorist financing. FIU-IND is the national agency responsible for receiving, processing, analysing, and disseminating information relating to suspect financial transactions. It is an independent body reporting to the Economic Intelligence Council headed by the Finance Minister. For administrative purposes, the FIU-IND is under the control of the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance.

Under the Rules issued under the PMLA, the following types of reports have been prescribed for the reporting entities:

- Cash Transaction Reports (CTRs)
- Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs)
- Counterfeit Currency Reports (CCRs)
- Non-Profit Organizations Transaction Reports (NTRs)

The FIU-IND's functions are defined under the PMLA. The Director, FIU-IND is empowered under Sections 12, 13, and 66 of the PMLA for exercise of powers relating to collection and dissemination of information. Powers relating to search and seizure are exercised by the ED. Notification No. 5/2005, dated 1 July 2005 confers various powers under the PMLA on the Director, FIU-IND.

For ensuring the availability of information with the FIU, Section 12 of the PMLA requires every banking company, financial institution, and intermediary (the reporting entities) to furnish information to the FIU and verify the identity of their clients in the manner prescribed. The reporting entities are also required to maintain and preserve records of transactions and identity of clients for a period of ten years from the date of cessation of transactions. Section 13 of the PMLA empowers the Director, FIU to call for records maintained by a reporting entity and enquire into cases of suspected failure of compliance with the provisions of the PMLA and also to impose fine.

#### **Central Economic Intelligence Bureau**

The CEIB functioning under the Ministry of Finance is responsible for coordination, intelligence sharing, and investigations at national as well as regional levels amongst various law enforcement agencies. The existing coordination mechanism in the CEIB consists of Regional Economic Intelligence Councils (REICs) at regional level and the Group on Economic Intelligence and meetings of the heads of investigating agencies under the Department of Revenue at the Centre. While the Group on Economic Intelligence is focussed on matters relating to intelligence sharing, the REICs and heads of agencies meetings cover both intelligence and investigations.

#### 8.22 Chapter 8 • Money Laundering

As per the charter of the CEIB, it has been assigned the responsibility of acting as the 'think tank' on issues relating to economic offences including data collection and collation policies and preparation and maintenance of dossiers of tax evaders, violators of economic laws, white-collar operators, etc. It also examines emerging trends and changing dynamics of economic offences. It takes note of the nexus among various stakeholders of these activities, their *modi operandi* and suggests measures for effectively dealing with them. It also analyses the macroeconomic impact of such activities and is the nodal agency for coordination at international level. It coordinates with the National Security Council Secretariat on matters having a bearing on national and economic security.

Human intelligence continuous to be the most important source of gathering information about evasion of various taxes and duties and generation of black money. During the course of investigation of customs offence cases, the CEIB comes across information relating to generation and parking of black money. All such information is shared with the relevant departments/agencies for further investigation and necessary action as may be warranted. In such matters interagency cooperation and sharing of information play a vital role.

Any information on black money or money laundering or *hawala* transactions is regularly shared with the ED and Director General of Income Tax so that proper action on all accounts is initiated in the matter. Evidence is shared with the ED to help establish cases of money laundering and *hawala* operations by unscrupulous importers/exporters and *hawala* operators. Cases of unaccounted cash recovery are reported to the DGIT (Investigation), CBDT to establish the source of the money and its proper accounting.

The CEIB maintains constant interaction with its Customs Overseas Investigation Network (COIN) offices to share intelligence and information on suspected import/export transactions. The COIN offices gather evidence through diplomatic channels from the foreign custom offices and other foreign establishments to establish cases of misdeclaration which are intricately linked with tax evasion and money laundering.

#### White Paper on Black Money—Government of India

- The generation of black money takes place through:
  - (i) Illegal acts like drug trade, terrorism and corruption or;
  - (ii) Voluntarily hiding the pay dues from the public exchequer in one form or another.
- An overview of the process of management of financial records and techniques of accounting to generate black money is provided in the report.
- Land and real estate, jewellery, financial markets, informal sector and cash economy are the sectors that are vulnerable to black money issues.
- The report states that to measure black money that is currently generated in India, all the departments need to work together in uniformity and unanimity.

- The Central Board of Direct Taxes, Enforcement Directorate, Financial Intelligence Unit and the Central Board of Excise and Customs are institutions that are currently responsible for dealing with issues related to black money.
- The Central Economic Intelligence Bureau, the National Investigation Agency, and the High-Level Committee are the coordinating agencies dealing with the issues related to black money.
- The Central government has listed a five-point strategy that involves:
  - (i) Joining the worldwide struggle against black money.
  - (ii) Creating a suitable legislative framework.
  - (iii) Setting up strong institutions to deal with illegal money.
  - (iv) Developing various systems for implementation.
  - (v) Imparting skills to working personnel for effective action.
- The report proposes a strategy based on four pillars to reduce black money generation:
  - (i) Reducing disincentives against voluntary compliance.
  - (ii) Reforms in sectors vulnerable to the generation of black money.
  - (iii) Creation of effective credible deterrence.
  - (iv) Supportive measures.

# **Special Investigation Team Recommends Steps to Curb Money Laundering**

The Supreme Court appointed a SIT to curb money laundering, and the team has proposed a list of recommendations:

- The team has advised action for trade-based money laundering; placing a ceiling on bigger cash transactions as these take place through illicit activities like drug trade and betting.
- The team has emphasized the need to verify the creation of black money in sectors like education and in the form of donations to religious institutions and trusts.
- The report has stressed on the need to establish additional courts to settle on the pending cases under the IT Act; also, the report emphasizes on the establishment of Central KYC Registry and empowers the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) under the Special Economic Zone Act.
- A recommendation has been made to eliminate the generation of black money through betting in cricket.
- The SIT has suggested that SEBI will need to have a monitoring mechanism to review the unusual rise in stock prices while dealing with illegal use of capital gain tax in the long-term.
- The ED must be informed to take necessary action for the offences under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
- As the participatory notes can be misused for money laundering, it is very important to obtain information on the beneficial ownership to prevent it from being misused. SEBI must be informed about the individual under KYC norms.

#### **8.24 Chapter 8 • Money Laundering**

- If the company or any organization becomes the holder of a participatory note, then SEBI should take information about the promoters and the directors of the company under the KYC norms.
- The transferable nature of the participatory notes makes it very difficult to trace the true beneficial owner since layering of transaction can be a complex process. SEBI needs to examine the provision of allowing the transfer of participatory notes to be beneficial for ease of foreign investment. And any investor who wants to invest will invest freshly through a foreign portfolio investor instead of buying from a participatory note holder.

#### **View of the Supreme Court on the Subject**

The following views of the Supreme Court on the subject of money laundering are pertinent:

'The incidence of crime, petty and grand, like any other social phenomena is often linked to transfers of monies, small or large. Money, in that sense, can both powers, and also reward, crime. As noted by many scholars, with increasing globalization, an ideology and social construct, in which transactions across borders are accomplished with little or no control over the quantum, and mode of transfer of money in exchange for various services an value rendered, both legal and illegal, nation-states also have begun to confront complex problem of crossborder crimes of all kinds'.

The worries of this court relate not merely due to the quantum of monies said to have been secreted away in foreign banks, but also the manner in which they many have been taken away from the country, and with the nature of activities that may have engendered the accumulation of such monies.

Large amounts of unaccounted monies, stashed away in banks located in jurisdictions that thrive on strong privacy laws protecting bearers of those accounts to avoid scrutiny, raise each and every worry delineated above. First and foremost, such large monies stashed abroad, and unaccounted for by individuals and entities of a country, would suggest the necessity of suspecting that they have been generated in activities that have been deemed to be unlawful. In addition, such large amounts of unaccounted monies would also lead to a natural suspicion that they have been transferred out of the country is order to evade payment to taxes, thereby depleting the capacity of the nation to undertake many tasks that are in public interest.

Consequently, the issue of unaccounted monies held by nationals, and other legal entities, in foreign banks, is of primordial importance to the welfare of the citizens. The quantum of such monies may be tough indicators of the weakness of the State, in terms of both crime prevention, and also of tax collection.

When a catchall word like 'crime' is used, it is common for people, and the popular culture to assume that it is 'petty crime' or crimes of passion committed by individuals. That would be a gross mischaracterization of the seriousness of the issues involved. Far more dangerous are the crime that threaten national security, and national interest. For instance, with globalization, nation states are also confronted in the dark worlds of international arms dealers, drug-peddlers, and various kinds of criminal networks, including networks of terror. International criminal networks that extend support to home-grown terror or extremist groups, or those that have been nurtured and sustained in hostile countries, depend on networks of formal and informal, lawful and unlawful mechanisms of transfer of monies across boundaries of nation-states. They work in the interstices of the microstructure of financial transfers across the global, and thrive in the lacunae, the gaps in law and of effort. The loosening of control over those mechanisms of transfers, guided by an extreme neoliberal thirst to create a global market that is free of the friction of law and its enforcement, by nation-states, may have also contributed to an increase in volume, extent and intensity of activities by criminal and terror networks across the globe.'

# **Conclusion**

It can be seen that the money laundering process involves activities that are crossborder and has international ramifications. Hence, in order to curtail this act, it is necessary that all countries should enact strict laws and legislations that will prevent the launderers from carrying out such activities. Also, such legislations especially in countries which are considered to be tax heavens can be a disincentive for the launderers and they will have no place to go. The international cooperation is lagging because there is no consensus on what constitutes a money laundering crime; therefore, it has been difficult to harmonize international efforts against the money laundering activities. Thus, steps have to be taken to devise measures that can be implemented across countries, keeping in mind that the money laundering process has transnational character.

The issue of confidentiality among the states is also a concern. Some of the jurisdictions do not want any kind of obligation under international treaty to disclose information regarding money laundering activities, especially related to disclosure of information from the National Bank. Thus, distinction has to be made between the confidentiality rules and usage of feature to carry out money laundering activities.

There is also a prevalent thought that the money laundering is a victimless crime. They are not aware of the ramifications of this crime. Firstly, the proceeds used for laundering comes from illegal and criminal activities, and secondly, such laundered money is once again used, purchase assets, etc., to build-up their criminal empire. Hence, there is need to create awareness regarding the criminal nature of the money laundering activities, and such step will help in better understanding of the issue and effective enforcement.

Apart from this, there needs to be effective coordination between the Centre and the States. The implementation and enforcement should happen at both at the Centre level and at the State level, it should not only be considered as the responsibility of the Centre. Decentralized implementation mechanism can go a long way in curbing these activities. Thus, in order to have an effective antimoney laundering regime, one has to think locally, nationally and globally.

#### **EU Directive of 2001 and Paris Declaration of 2002**

- The European Union too has issued a new Money Laundering Directive in December 2001 to amend its earlier Directive of 1991, which already contained strong anti-money laundering measures which required financial institutions to know their customers, maintain appropriate records and establish anti-money laundering programmes.
- The Directive of 2001 extends coverage to *bureaux de change*, money transfer companies and investment firms. Definition of 'criminal activity' is also expanded to cover not only drug trafficking, but also all serious crimes including corruption and fraud against the EU.
- The Directive significantly brings within its ambit lawyers, auditors, accountants, tax advisers, real estate agents and notaries when they participate in the movement of money for their clients. They have to now report to the authorities any transaction that indicates laundering of money.

#### **UN Convention and Security Council Resolution**

- The UN Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism was proposed on 9 December 1999, which was open for signature from 10 January 2000 to 21 December 2001.
- Subsequently, the convention has entered into force on 10 April 2002.
- At present, 68 nations have ratified the convention.
- The convention has a major shortcoming, as it does not provide for a monitoring agency to oversee enforcement of the convention.

#### **USA Patriot Act of 2001**

- Lawmakers worldwide have felt that concerted efforts are required to deal with terrorist funding to tackle terrorism. The US Congress passed the USA Patriot Act of 2001 within 43 days of 11 September 2001, 26 October 2001. This Act made as many as 52 amendments to the existing Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA). The scope of these new provisions touched every financial institution and business not only in the US, but also in most of the world.
- One of the changes made in the BSA requires every financial institution to establish anti-money laundering programmes.
- Moreover, the list of businesses now defined as financial institutions is wide ranging and includes banks, brokers and dealers in securities or commodities, currency exchanges, insurance companies, credit card operators, dealers in precious metals, stones and jewels, travel agencies, businesses engaged in the sale of vehicles including automobiles,

air planes and boats, casinos and gaming establishments, and even telegraph companies and US postal service.

- It also adds underground banking systems, such as '*hawala'*, to the definition of financial institutions. It creates customer identification and due diligence duties.
- At the same time, it grants immunity to financial institutions and their employees for sharing reports of suspicious activities with any government agency or with each other. It also makes it a crime to conceal more than US \$ 10,000 in currency or monetary instruments while entering or leaving the US.
- As a result, hundreds of thousands of financial institutions and businesses, who were not previously concerned about money laundering, now have to maintain anti-money laundering programmes requiring them to 'develop internal policies, procedures and controls', 'designate a compliance officer', conduct 'ongoing employee training programmes' and perform 'independent audit functions'.
- The US intelligence agencies can now have access to reports and records of financial institutions and businesses including suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed by them. One of the major changes is prohibition of correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks, which have no physical presence anywhere. A foreign bank must have a fixed address, employ at least one full-time employee, maintain operating records and be inspected by a banking authority to qualify for a correspondent account.
- Apart from amending the BSA, the USA Patriot Act of 2001 also made changes in the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986.
- It now acquires extraterritorial jurisdiction to combat terrorist funding and criminal proceeds.
- The law covered funds representing proceeds of nearly 200 specified unlawful activities (SUAs) such as fraud, kidnapping, gambling, espionage, drug trafficking, etc. It now covers bribing of a foreign public official, embezzlement of public funds, smuggling or export control violations involving items covered by the Arms Export Control Act as well as crimes of violence.
