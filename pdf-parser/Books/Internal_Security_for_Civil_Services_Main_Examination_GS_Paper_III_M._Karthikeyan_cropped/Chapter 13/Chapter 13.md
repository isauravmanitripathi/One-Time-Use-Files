This shall be achieved through laying down policies and guidelines, setting standards for quality policing, facilitating their implementation and ensuring that the police performs its task in a professional manner with functional autonomy.

• No government functionary shall issue any instructions to any police functionary which are illegal or malafide.

# **Separation of Investigation from other Functions**

- Crime Investigation should be separated from other policing functions. A Crime Investigation Agency should be constituted in each state.
- This agency should be headed by a Chief of Investigation under the administrative control of a Board of Investigation, to be headed by a retired/ sitting judge of the High Court. The Board should have an eminent lawyer, an eminent citizen, a retired police officer, a retired civil servant, the Home Secretary (ex-officio), the Director General of Police (ex-Officio), Chief of the Crime Investigation Agency (ex-officio) and the Chief of Prosecution (ex-officio) as Members.
- Once the Crime Investigation Agency is staffed, all ranks should develop expertise in that field and there should be no transfer to other Agencies. Appropriate mechanisms should be developed to ensure coordination between the Investigation, Forensic and the Law and Order Agencies, at the Local, District and the State levels.

#### **Accountability of Law and Order Machinery**

- A State Police Performance and Accountability Commission should be constituted, with the following as Members: Home Minister (Chairman), Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly, Chief Secretary, Secretary in charge of the Home Department, Director General of Police as its Member Secretary, For matters pertaining to Director General of Police, including his appointment, the Home Secretary shall be the Member Secretary, Five non-partisan eminent citizens.

  - ° prepare panels for the office of Director General of Police against prescribed criteria;
  - ° identify performance indicators to evaluate the functioning of the police service; and
  - ° Review and evaluate organizational performance of the police service.

- The State Government should appoint the Chief of Law and Order Police from the panel recommended by the State Police Performance and Accountability Commission. The panel will be for the 'office' of Director General of Police and not to other posts of the 'rank' of DGP.
- The tenure of the Chief of the Law and Order Police as well as the Chief of the Crime Investigation Agency should be at least three years and the order of removal should be passed only after it has been cleared by the State Police Performance and Accountability Commission (or the State Investigation Board, in the case of Chief of Investigation).

## **Competent Prosecution and Guidance to Investigation**

- A system of District Attorney should be instituted. The District Attorney shall function under the Chief Prosecutor of the State. The District Attorney should also guide investigation of crimes in the district.
- The Chief Prosecutor for the State shall be appointed by the Board of Investigation for a period of three years. The Chief Prosecutor shall be an eminent criminal lawyer. The Chief Prosecutor would supervise and guide the District Attorneys.

# **Reducing Burden of Police - Outsourcing Non Core Functions**

- Each State Government should immediately set up a multi-disciplinary task force to draw up a list of non-core police functions that could be outsourced to other agencies. Such functions should be outsourced in a phased manner.
- Necessary capacity building exercise would have to be carried out for such agencies and functionaries in order to develop their skills in these areas.

# **Empowering the 'Cutting Edge' Functionaries**

- The existing system of the constabulary should be substituted with recruitment of graduates at the level of Assistant Sub- Inspector of Police (ASI). Recruitment of constables would, however, continue in the Armed Police.
- The orderly system should be abolished with immediate effect.
- The procedure for recruitment of police functionaries should be totally transparent and objective.

#### **Strengthening Intelligence Gathering**

• The intelligence gathering machinery in the field needs to be strengthened and at the same time, made more accountable. Human intelligence should be combined with information derived from diverse sources with the focus

#### **Annexure-1 • Summary of 5th Report of 2nd A1.4 ARC on Public Order...**

on increased use of technology. Adequate powers should be delegated to intelligence agencies to procure/use latest technology.

- The beat police system should be revived and strengthened.
- Informants giving information should be protected to keep their identity secret so that they do not fear any threat to life or revenge.

## **Gender Issues in Policing**

- The representation of women in police at all levels should be increased through affirmative action so that they constitute about 33% of the police.
- Police at all levels as well as other functionaries of the criminal justice system need to be sensitised on gender issues through well structured training programmes.
- Citizens groups and NGOs should be encouraged to increase awareness about gender issues in society and help bring to light violence against women and also assist the police in the investigation of crimes against women.

# **Crimes against Vulnerable Sections**

- The administration and police should be sensitised towards the special problems of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Appropriate training programmes could help in the sensitising process.
- The administration and police should play a more pro-active role in detection and investigation of crimes against the weaker sections. The administration should also focus on rehabilitation of the victims and provide all required support including counselling by experts.
- As far as possible the deployment of police personnel in police stations with significant proportion of religious and linguistic minorities should be in proportion to the population of such communities within the local jurisdiction of such police station. The same principle should be followed in cases of localities having substantial proportion of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes population.
- Government must take concrete steps to increase awareness in the administration and among the police in particular, regarding crimes against children and take steps not only to tackle such crimes, but also to deal with the ensuing trauma.

#### **Regulating Processions, Demonstrations and Gatherings**

• Based on the experience with major riots and the recommendations of various Commissions of Inquiry and pronouncements of the Supreme Court and the High Courts, fresh and comprehensive guidelines may be drawn up for regulation of processions, protest marches and morchas.

- The guidelines should include preparatory steps (through intelligence sources), serious consultation and attempts to arrive at agreement with the groups/communities involved, regarding route, timing and other aspects of procession. They should also cover prohibition of provocative slogans or acts as well as carrying of lethal weapons. It should be specifically stated in the guidelines that all processions or demonstrations should be dealt with the same degree of fairness and firmness.
- Organisations and persons found guilty of instigating violence should be liable to pay exemplary damages. The damages should be commensurate with the loss caused by such violence. The law should provide for distribution of the proceeds of damages to the victims of such violence.

## **Measures to be Taken Once a Riot has Started**

- If violence erupts, then the first priority should be to quickly suppress the violence. In cases of communal violence, the situation should be brought under control by effective use of force.
- Prohibitory orders must be enforced rigorously.
- If the situation so warrants, the forces of the Union and the Army should be requisitioned and used without any reluctance or delay.
- The Commissioner of Police or the District Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police should be given a free hand to deal with the situation in accordance with law.
- The media should be briefed with correct facts and figures so that there is no scope for rumour mongering.
- The police needs to be equipped with state-of-the-art crowd dispersal equipments.
- The District Magistrate should ensure that essential supplies are maintained and relief is provided, especially in vulnerable areas and particularly during prolonged spells of 'curfew'.

## **Measures to be Taken Once Normalcy has been Restored**

- No sanction of the Union Government or the State Government should be necessary for prosecution under Section 153(A). Section 196 Cr PC should be amended accordingly.
- Prosecution in cases related to rioting or communal offences should be not sought to be withdrawn.
- Commissions of Inquiry into any major riots/violence should give their
- report within one year.
- The recommendations made by a Commission of Inquiry should normally be accepted by the Government and if the Government does not agree with any observation or recommendation contained in the report of the Commission, it should record its reasons and make them public.

## **Annexure-1 • Summary of 5th Report of 2nd A1.6 ARC on Public Order...**

- All riots should be documented properly and analysed so that lessons could be drawn from such experiences.
- There is need for adequate follow up to ensure proper rehabilitation of victims.

# **Adoption of Zero Tolerance Strategy**

- All public agencies should adopt a zero tolerance strategy towards crime, in order to create a climate of compliance with laws leading to maintenance of public order.
- This strategy should be institutionalised in the various public agencies by creating appropriate statistical databases, backed up by modern technology, to monitor the level and trends of various types of offences and link these to a system of incentives and penalties for the officials working in these agencies. It should be combined with initiatives to involve the community in crime prevention measures.

## **Federal Crimes**

- There is need to re-examine certain offences which have inter-state or national ramification and include them in a new law. The law should also prescribe the procedure for investigation and trials of such offences. The following offences may be included in this category: Organised Crime, Terrorism, Acts threatening National security, Trafficking in arms and human beings, Sedition, Major crimes with inter-state ramifications, Assassination of (including attempts on) major public figures, Serious economic offences.
- A new law should be enacted to govern the working of the CBI. This law should also stipulate its jurisdiction including the power to investigate the new category of crimes.

#### **Organised Crime**

Specific provisions to define organised crimes should be included in the new law governing 'Federal Crimes'. The definition of organised crime in this law should be on the lines of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999.

#### **Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958**

The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 should be repealed. To provide for an enabling legislation for deployment of Armed Forces of the Union in the North-Eastern states of the country, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 should be amended by inserting a new Chapter VI A as recommended by the Committee to Review the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958. The new Chapter VI A would apply only to the North-Eastern states.

### **The Role of Civil Society**

- Citizens should be involved in evaluating the quality of service at police stations and other police offices.
- Government should incentivise citizens' initiatives.
- Formal mechanisms should be set up at the cutting edge level to involve citizens/citizen's groups in various aspects of public order management.

# **The Role of the Media in Public Order**

- The Administration must make facts available to the media at the earliest about any major development, particularly activities affecting public order.
- In order to have better appreciation of each other's viewpoints there should be increased interaction between the Administration and the media. This could be inter alia in the form of joint workshops and trainings.
- The Administration should designate points of contact at appropriate levels (a spokesperson) for the media which could be accessed during whenever required.
- Officers should be imparted training for interaction with the media.
- A cell may be constituted at the district level which may analyse media reports about matters of public importance.
