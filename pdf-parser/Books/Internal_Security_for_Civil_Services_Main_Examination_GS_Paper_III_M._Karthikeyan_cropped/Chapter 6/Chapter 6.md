The Indian peninsula is surrounded by the Indian Ocean, the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea which opened up for international sea trade from the 15th century. But the same geographical proximity to the sea has posed a threat to the national security in recent times. India has a long coastline of 7,516 km (the mainland coastline runs for nearly 5,400 km, and the coastline of island territories of Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep runs for nearly 2,200 km). The Indian coastline studded with numerous creeks, coves, brooks, rivulets, backwaters, landing points, bays, streams, sandbanks, mangroves and forested land presents itself as an ideal sanctuary for clandestine activities.

Before analysing the various attacks through the sea in the past and the possible threats in the future, and the response of the government to maritime security threat, one should know about UNCLOS – II, 1973, which defines various maritime zones of the sea, which also confers the right of the maritime states over the different zones of the sea.

*The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is an international agreement that was a product of the third UN conference on the law of the seas that took place between 1973 and 1982. It defi nes the rights, responsibilities and duties of world nations with regard to the use of the ocean, gives guidelines for sea trade, usage of ocean environment and management of marine natural resources.*

*The convention demarcates various areas of the coastal seas. They are measured from the base line or low water line that runs along the coastal area.* 

#### **The various areas are:**

*The internal waters: This includes all water bodies and water ways extending landward from the baseline. The right of passage of foreign vessels into these waters is restricted and is subject to permission being granted by the coastal state. The coastal states have absolute jurisdiction over these waters. They can make laws regulating the use of these waters and any resources in these waters.*

*Territorial waters: This includes all waters extending seaward, from the base line up to 12 nautical miles (22 km). Here too the coastal state can make laws regulating the use of these waters and any resources in these waters. The right of innocent passage through these waters is granted to foreign vessels.* 

*Contiguous zone: This includes all waters extending seaward, between 12 nautical miles (22 km) and 24 nautical miles (44 km) from the base line. The state's jurisdiction is restricted to fields of customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. These waters are thus also referred to as customs waters.* 

*Exclusive economic zone (EEZ): This includes all waters extending seaward, from the baseline up to 200 nautical miles (370 km). The rights to exploit all natural resources in these waters are vested solely in the coastal state.*

#### **The Coastal Security Threat**

The coastal security threat is not limited to the physical coastline but also extends till the EEZ. Offshore oil and gas rigs, refineries, atomic power stations, shipyards and important cities are all located along the coast. Over 90% of India's trade is made possible through major and non-major ports. Any threat to these installations would have devastating economic consequences. This makes these institutions highly vulnerable to attacks of terrorist and other enemy nations who seek to destabilise our country.

The last two decades have brought about a tremendous change in the perception of what one would call maritime security threat. From the traditional threat by state actors, the threats posed by non-state actors such as terrorists, pirates, smugglers, traffickers, etc. are on the rise and is proving to be dangerous.

In the 1993 coordinated bomb attack in Mumbai, the explosives were brought through sea into Maharashtra. In 1991, assassins of Rajiv Gandhi came from Sri Lanka via the sea. The 26/11 Mumbai attack was carried out by 10 Pakistan terrorists, who hijacked a fishing vessel *MV Kuber*, shot the crew and arrived in Mumbai to carry out the attacks. These and many other terror attacks have proved that threat from the sea to India's internal security is real.

The global trade and its maritime focus have shifted from the Atlantic– Pacific to the Indo-Pacific. This has reoriented the importance of the Indian Ocean region and brought with it the threats to India's backyard – the Indian Ocean. To this effect, India's national security construct has greatly increased its attention in the Indian ocean region.

Increased activity in the Indian Ocean region owing to growing trade in goods and resources has given rise to newer forms of maritime security challenges. India, China and other southeast Asian nations depend on crude oil and natural gas imports from the West Asian nation for their energy security. All energy products are transported through sea and as such are exposed to threats from pirates. Further, Chinese advances in the Indian Ocean pose a threat particularly to India.

The *Enrica Lexie* incident where Italian marines were accused of shooting dead Indian fishermen mistaking them for pirates in the EEZ of India showcases new dimensions of security challenges, where the livelihood of coastal people are threatened. Similarly, the frequent incidents involving the Sri Lankan Navy and Indian fishermen also bring to light the livelihood threat of coastal people.

#### **6.4 Chapter 6 • Coastal Security**

Also the intrusion of fishermen from Pakistan, Myanmar, Thailand and other nations into the EEZ of India poses challenges to coastal security. These fishermen could act as traffickers of drugs, arms and illegal migrants.

#### **Coastal Security Scheme**

The Kargil War ignited an overwhelming public debate over the issues pertaining to the security of the nation. In response, the government constituted the Kargil Review Committee in 1999. The committee recommended that a group of ministers be constituted with the objective to come up with an extensive security system for both land and sea. Accordingly, the group of ministers' task force recommended opening maritime police stations under the Coastal Security Scheme. Further, the jurisdiction of territorial waters was supposed to be vested with the state police, that of the EEZ with the Indian Coast Guard and beyond the EEZ with the Indian Navy.

Under the first phase of the Coastal Security Scheme, 73 marine police stations, 204 interceptor boats, 97 check points and 58 outposts were established. Under the second phase of the Coastal Security Scheme, 131 marine police stations, 180 boats, 60 jetties, 131 four wheelers and 242 motorcycles were established.

This multi-layer coastal security apparatus with the Indian Navy, Indian Coastal Guard, State Marine Police and other sister agencies constitutes the present set up of coastal security in India.

*The Maritime Zone of India Act 1976 was enacted to provide for matters in connection with the territorial waters, continental shelf, EEZ and other maritime zones of India. The Maritime Zone of India Act 1976 was enacted to give effect to the UNCLOS – III. The features of this Act are:*

- (a) *The Central Government may cause the base line.*
- (b) *Maritime boundaries between India and neighbouring countries are to be determined by agreement or through the point of being equidistant.*
- (c) *The government may decide on historic waters of India.*
- (d) *Defined territorial water, contiguous water and the EEZ of India and continental shelf of India.*
- (e) *The sovereignty of India extends to territorial water of India, the sea bed, the underlying subsoil and the airspace above.*
- (f) *All foreign ships shall enjoy the right of innocent passage through the territorial waters.*

#### **Coastal Security System**

- Post the 26/11 Mumbai attack, coastal security was restructured, extending the defensive line further into the sea.
- The multi-layered system of coastal security, which previously covered Gujarat and Maharashtra, was extended to the entire coastline.

- The Indian Navy was made the core of the coastal security system. The complete responsibility of defence of the entire coastal and offshore areas was handed over to the Indian Navy.
- The Indian Coast Guard (ICG), the marine police and other central and state agencies were designated to play a supporting role to the Indian navy.
- Naval commanders-in-chief were re-designated as the Commanders-inchief, Coastal Defence.
- The Director General, Coast Guard, was re-designated as Commander, Coastal Command, and was given the responsibility of overall coordination of central and state agencies in matters of coastal security.
- In addition to the EEZ, the Indian Coast Guard was given the responsibility of coastal security of territorial waters, which hitherto was exclusively under the marine police. The marine police are to assist the Coast Guard in territorial waters.
- The water wing of the BSF is given the responsibility of securing the creeks and waterways in the Gulf of Kutch, Gulf of Cambay and the Sunderbans. These areas are infamous for being the preferred locales for sheltering antinational elements and extensive trafficking.
- The Indian Navy established four Joint Operation Centres (JOCs) in all naval commands. They are at Vishakhapatnam, Mumbai, Kochi and Port Blair. All the coastal security operations today are coordinated from the JOC. The marine police, Customs, Intelligence Bureau and other central and state agencies are now coupled with the JOCs. Besides JOCs, an operational centre is established in every coastal district for coordinating operations in their respective districts.
- The Indian Navy created a special force called Sagar Prahari Bal or Ocean Strike Unit to protect naval bases and other areas. It comprises 1,000 personnel and 80 fast interceptor boats for patrolling.
- The CISF which provides security for India's major ports also participate in coordinated joint operations. They are now being trained in seamanship to deal with any seaborne threats.
- The International Ship and Port Facility Security-Code (ISPS-Code) compliance which deals with the security of ships and port facilities is being strictly pushed onto all major ports and non-major ports. Accordingly, ports must be equipped with security system, security personnel and security equipment. Further, compliant ports must segregate fishing vessel lanes from non-merchant vessels.
- Surveillance and intelligence gathering are the core of any security establishment to counter security threats. With respect to coastal security, an informal group comprising fishermen and trained volunteers of the coastal areas are used for surveillance and intelligence gathering. These groups are called Sagar Suraksha Dal. They monitor the coastal waters and share information of any suspicious happenings or vessels.

#### **6.6 Chapter 6 • Coastal Security**

- The Indian Navy has established the National Command Control Communication Intelligence (NC3I). It is a network that links 51 Naval and Coast Guard stations, located along the coast and on island territories. The network provides these stations coastal surveillance information obtained from various sensors such as the coastal radar chain of the Indian Coast Guard and automatic tracking systems as well as electro-optical cameras. The network rides on dedicated terrestrial data circuits as well as satellite communication, which helps the stations in remote locations to be networked.
- IMAC is the nodal centre of the National Command Control Communications and Intelligence Network (NC3I Network).
- It is a network that hosts the Information Management and Analysis Centre (IMAC). The focus is on building a National Maritime Domain Awareness (NMDA) grid via a number of organisational, operational and technological changes. The network connects 51 radar stations (20 Indian Navy and 31 Coast Guard) located along the coast and on the island territories, and helps collate, fuse and disseminate critical intelligence and information about unusual or suspicious movements and activities at sea.
- IMAC is the nodal centre of the National Command Control Communications and Intelligence Network. It is here that data from various sensors and databases are aggregated, correlated and then disseminated to various stations for enhanced awareness. The software on which the coastal surveillance will be carried out incorporates hi-tech features like data fusion, correlation and decision support features thus facilitating better decision making.
- The National Committee to Strengthen Coastal and Maritime Security was constituted by the government to supervise the implementations of coastal security schemes. The committee is headed by the Cabinet Secretary. The committee meets once in six months and reviews the implementation of various decisions taken as a part of Coastal Security Scheme.

#### **Inadequacies in Coastal Security Architecture**

The three-tier coastal security establishment involving the marine police, ICG and Indian Navy makes it difficult to fix accountability if any unfortunate incident occurs. When something happens a blame game begins among the three establishments. Each one will vehemently defend their turf and blame the others for any lapses that may occur.

Multiple organisations are involved in the coastal security. In addition to ICG, marine police and Indian Navy, the Customs Department, CISF and BSF are also involved in coastal security. This leads to coordination problems, chaos during operations and frequent misunderstanding among the organisations. This turns out to be counterproductive in terms of coastal security.

The states have been reluctant in giving importance to sea-borne threats. The marine police are poorly equipped and ill trained. The reason is that most states do not perceive any real threat to them from the sea. Therefore, coastal security is not on the top of their priorities.

Insufficient funds are cited as a big reason for all the shortfalls in the coastal security. The procurement plans of the Navy and the Coast Guard have been long pending for want of funds. This has made the Navy and ICG woefully short in manpower and firepower.

We do not have a clear maritime policy, which would clearly demarcate the roles and responsibilities of the centre, the states and other agencies involved in coastal security. Coming up with a maritime policy requires cooperation and coordination of all the coastal states and union territories, several ministries and departments and the centre. This proves to be a very uphill task.

### **Coastal Security-Steps to Improve**

Ever since the dreadful night of the Mumbai terror attacks of 2008, the government of India has come up with a number of strategies to fortify coastal and maritime zones along the entire shoreline. Thanks to the tireless efforts of several departments at the state and national level, the following initiatives are being implemented to ensure that our coastal frontiers are much stronger than before. Due to the heavy surveillance of vessel movement along the western coast, the naval authorities were able to intercept and prevent a potential terror attack off the coast of Porbandar in 2015.

- At the apex level, the National Committee for Strengthening Maritime and Coastal Security (NCSMCS), headed by the cabinet secretary, coordinates all matters related to maritime and coastal security.
- Joint Operations Centres (JOCs), set up by the Indian Navy as commandand-control hubs for coastal security at Mumbai, Visakhapatnam, Kochi and Port Blair are fully operational. These JOCs are manned 24 × 7 jointly by the Indian Navy, Indian Coast Guard and Marine Police.
- Round the clock surveillance of the western coastline is being carried out through ships and aircrafts. This enables swift detection of potential threats and their mitigation.

Since 2008, coastal and maritime security has been strengthened substantially by successful implementation of technical, organisational and procedural initiatives, by all maritime-security agencies. Plugging gaps, where identified, is a continuous process that is being addressed appropriately.

#### **Inter-agency Cooperation**

Inter-agency coordination is one of the key components of success during counterattack operations. To enhance this feature, the Indian Navy regularly conducts training exercises with 15 national and state agencies.

#### **Technological Strengthening**

To further strengthen coastal security, state-of-the-art technology has been implemented for coastal surveillance. It features a secure network of 74 Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers and a chain of 46 coastal radars along the coastline, which can enable quick responses in case of emergencies or potential hazards.

#### **The National Command Control Centre and Intelligence Network**

Inaugurated in 2016, this wide-security network provides data about ships, fishing boats, dhows and all other vessels near the coast. By collecting information from multiple technical sources including the AIS and the coastal radar chain, the Information Management and Analysis Centre (IMAC), Gurgaon, processes the information and disseminates this to all 51 nodes of the navy and coast guard across the coast of India.

#### **Fishermen and Coastal Security**

The Indian fishing communities are highly adept at seafaring and therefore play a critical role in the domain of maritime security. To harness this potential, registration of fishing vessels, providing them with ID cards and equipping boats with necessary tracking devices have been done. In addition, coastal-awareness campaigns and programmes for the fishermen community are being conducted by the Indian Navy and the coast guard. They have been strongly advised to remain within territorial waters and not to cross the maritime boundary.

#### **Maritime Training to State Police**

To provide periodic maritime training to state marine-police units, permanent marine-police training institutes have been commissioned at Tamil Nadu and Gujarat.

To ensure that a repeat of 26/11 doesn't happen, the navy, air force and the coast guard jointly conduct an annual Defence of Gujarat Exercise for 5 days. On the occasion of the 6th anniversary of the Mumbai terror attacks, over 30 ships and submarines and aircraft of the Indian Navy, Indian Air Force, coast guard and state agencies were deployed for this exercise off the western coast of India. The defence of offshore oil-production units, which is essential for our energy security, was also tested.
