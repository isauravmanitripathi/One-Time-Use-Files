## **inTroduCTion**

Cyber security or information security is securing one's information systems such as computers, networks, programs and data in cyber space from unauthorised access, theft, change or destruction.

Governments, military, critical infrastructure establishments, corporations, financial institutions, hospitals and others accumulate, save and transmit vast amounts of confidential information across their information systems. Cyber attacks are targeted at both the individual and the collective level. From protecting personal information, cyber security extrapolates into safeguarding national security and sovereignty.

#### **Types of Attacks**

The attacks on information infrastructure can be classified into three types:

- **(a) Physical attack**: In this type, physical damage is inflicted upon the information infrastructure using conventional methods, fire or bomb attack.
- **(b) Syntactic attack**: In this type, the attack is on the functioning of the information system. System logics are modified and manipulated to perform unintended and unnecessary tasks such as causing delay in processing, shutting down the programs and processes or making the system erratic. Computer viruses and Trojans are the popular tools of syntactic attacks.
- **(c) Semantic attack**: In this type, the trust and confidence of the system user are exploited. The attacker dupes the user into thinking that they are doing the intended thing when in reality they are doing something different. This kind of attack mostly involves financial scams, stock market crashes, duplication of websites, etc.

## **Cyber terrorism**

Dorothy Dennings defines cyber terrorism as the convergence of terrorism and cyber space.

Terrorists induce fear by indulging in large-scale disruption and handicapping of computer systems, sabotaging networks and critical infrastructure by using various tools such as viruses, Trojans, malware, etc. for the furtherance of their political objectives. This is the traditional or conventional way of defining cyber terrorism. The 1998 attack on the Sri Lankan Embassies by the LTTE was considered the first ever act of cyber terrorism.

Going beyond the traditional act of cyber terrorism, an act of cyber terrorism should be looked at much more than causing disruption to computers. It may sometimes lead to violence. Such attacks are even more dangerous than what is considered conventional cyber terror attacks. It is as simple as spreading rumors that can trigger violence. For instance, the rumor that northeast people in Bangalore were attacked resulted in mass exodus of these people back to their states.

It is also the use of cyber space as back-end support to the traditional forms of terrorism like fedayeen attacks, co-ordinated attacks, suicide bombings, soliciting funds, recruiting wannabe terrorists, spreading terrorist propaganda by creating websites and social networking avenues are some ways of lending back-end support to traditional terrorists. This comes under the category of using technology for psychological warfare.

## TOOLS OF CYBER TERRORISM/CRIME

These are some of the tools that are used by cyber terrorists:

![](_page_2_Figure_3.jpeg)

- (a) **Hacking:** It is a process of having unauthorised access to another person's computer or information system. A person who performs this activity is referred to as a hacker.
- **(b) Trojans:** Trojan is an illegitimate programme, which disguises as a legitimate program. It tricks the user into believing that he/she is running a program, which they intend to when in reality an unintended program is being run.
- (c) Computer viruses: They are programmes that replicate themselves continuously on being copied. They can also do things, which can harm the computer. They can be sent as an attachment via e-mail or come attached via a downloaded file or transmitted through external memory devices.

## **7.4 Chapter 7 â€¢ Cyber Security**

- **(d) Computer worms:** They are similar to a computer virus in that they also replicate. However, they are standalone programmes, meaning they do not need to attach to a file to spread infection and they can be an individual independent program. They spread through network connections or through downloaded file.
- **(e) E-mail-related crime:** Crimes done using e-mails form the larger threat to cyber space. Spreading rumours, luring people with wrong information, issuing threats and posting defamatory messages, etc. are some types of e-mail-related crimes.
- **(f) Denial of service:** It is an attempt to deny authorised persons access to an online service. It is done by overwhelming the Website with traffic from multiple sources. A wide variety of important services such as accessing e-mail, Websites, online accounts, online banking services, news Websites, etc. are the main targets.
- **(g) Cryptology:** Terrorists, fundamentalists, insurgents, rebels, etc. use encryption to mask the data they want to store or communicate. It is not an easy task trying to decrypt the encrypted message.
- **(h) Social engineering attacks:** In the context of cyber security, social engineering means gaining the confidence of individuals by manipulation and making them divulge confidential information to strangers. The criminals usually trick people into revealing their password, bank details and other confidential information.
- **(i) IP spoofing:** IP spoofing is gaining unauthorised access of a computer or network camouflaging one's identity to that of a trusted host. The IP address of the trusted host is masked by the IP address of the scamster thereby leading the user to the false Website and not the intended site.
- **(j) Phishing:** Phishing is the method adopted to acquire private information such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, etc. An e-mail is sent to the user claiming to be a legitimate enterprise to make the user surrender private information.
- **(k) Ransomware:** Ransomware is a type of cyber crime whereby, first, a system or network is infected by a malware, which restricts or prevents legitimate users from accessing the computer or network. Then a ransom is sought by the creator of the malware to lift the restriction.
- **(l) Skimming:** Skimming is a method by which a device is used to steal credit card information. The legitimate credit card is swiped on the device, which steals the data on the magnetic strip of the credit card and they creates a clone of the credit card. This credit card information obtained is either directly used by the skimmer or is also sold online. This information is mostly bought by terrorist organisations.

## **Cyber Warfare**

It is an illegitimate activity of one nation that is performed by an attempt to damage the information networks of the other nation using computer viruses, worms and other hacking tools. The various ways by which a nation or organisation indulges in warfare in cyber space against another nation are.

- disabling official Websites and networks.
- disrupting or disabling essential services,
- stealing classified data,
- crippling financial systems,
- sabotaging strategic infrastructures and
- sabotaging satellites and communication networks.

## **Types of Cyber Warfare**

**1. Espionage:** It is the act of cyber spying engaged by a nation or organisation upon another nation or organisation. A nation acquires secret and classified information illegally by another nation using various illegal methods on the Internet, networks or individual computers. Nations engage in this type of attack not only during wartime but also during times of peace. Further, a nation engages in cyber espionage not strictly on enemy or rival nations but sometimes on allies, friends and neutral nations.

**2. Sabotage:** In this type of cyber warfare, the attack is on a nation's critical infrastructure such as power plants, air traffic control, nuclear establishments, research facilities, etc. Computers, Websites or networks of these infrastructures are hijacked or blocked from functioning. This is done by hacking into the networks or computers, infecting the systems or networks by viruses or worms or Trojans, spamming the network, employing denial of service tactics, etc. This may lead the nation into crisis or chaos as it disrupts the day-to-day activities of citizens of the nations. Few occurrences of sabotages in the recent past are as follows:

- 1. *Stuxnet: It is a computer worm that is jointly developed by the United States and Israel to monitor and control the target nation's industrial facilities like power plants, waste processing systems and other industrial operations. It makes the users to take control of the target nation's industrial control system without their knowledge.* The United States *used this computer worm to sabotage Iran's nuclear program.*
- 2. *GhostNet: It is a spyware that uses a malicious software program called* the Remote Access Tool (RAT*) to remotely steal sensitive documents and control the system.* The Remote Access Tool *provides the user the ability to control the target system whenever online. This malware was found in 2009 by the researcher of People's Republic of China. It has been used on many countries but still there has not been any conclusive evidence that it has been operated by China.*

## **Challenges to India's Cyber Security**

The information technology (IT) revolution in India has enabled a huge data bank of information to float in cyber space. We set upon the path of electronic governance and are in the process of making every service available digitally. Filing income tax returns, applying for passports and visa, railway ticketing, etc. are fully functional under the governance plan. The criminal justice system â€“ police and judiciary â€“ are also following suit. They are on track to go fully digital. The tourism industry is hugely dependent on cyber space. Almost all Indian banks have opted for full-scale digitalisation. E-commerce is booming. The stock markets have been completely computerised. Further, the Digital India campaign is speeding the process of computerisation of all services â€“ public and private.

The flip side of this revolution, however, is that all these services act as sitting ducks for criminals, terrorists and hostile countries to attack. These act as waiting targets for terrorists to paralyze the economic and financial institutions. The damage can be disastrous and irreparable.

Cyber attacks on critical infrastructures like the banking system, air traffic control, power infrastructure, gas pipelines, etc. can cause havoc. The 2012 power blackout in northern and eastern India was a result of grid failure. We are aware of the chaos and losses that were a result of the blackout. A similar situation may arise through cyber attacks. The recent Stuxnet virus attack on a nuclear facility in Iran is a wakeup call for us. Though the target was the Iran nuclear facility, it affected installations in India operating with the Siemens system.

According to Internet World Stats, as on 30 June 2015, India has the second most Internet users in the world after China with 354,000,000 users. This is only bound to increase in years to come.

Hacking of Indian government Websites by Pakistan criminals has been on the rise since 2000. China too is evolving as a formidable force to reckon with in cyber space. There are cases of Chinese hacking into national security domains of India. It is reported that China's People's Liberation Army has trained more than 30,000 cyber warriors to wage war in cyber space as and when desired.

Cyber security must be given special importance in the national security policy as the world is evolving with computers, criminal activities, and all these will be of high risk to the nation's security. It is only a matter of time before an all-out cyber war would begin.

## **Cyber Attacks against India**

India has been a victim of cyber attack for quite some time now. These attacks mainly originate from two nations, namely, Pakistan and China. These two nations pose the major cyber warfare threats to India.

## **Cyber War by Pakistan**

Hackers from Pakistan have been targeting Indian Websites from way back in 1998. These attacks have intensified over the years and today are the single largest source of attacks against India. The groups involved in these attacks include Pakistan Cyber Army, Pakistan G Force, Pakistan Hackers Club and Team\_H4tr!ck. These are some of the most notorious groups who attack India's cyberspace.

In 2010, the Pakistan Cyber Army attacked the website of the CBI and the National Informatics Centre. Similar such attacks from Pakistan are constantly bombarding Indian security establishments. Team\_H4tr!ck is the most active of them all and is responsible for hacking numerous Indian websites.

In 2012, post Assam violence, the mass exodus of students belonging to the northeastern region from Bangalore and other areas was caused by rumours spread on social media by Pakistani cyber criminals.

## **Cyber War by China**

The attacks arising from China are chiefly in the form of cyber espionage. They siphon off confidential and highly classified information relating to national security. China maintains cyber warriors as part of PLA who indulge in such activities. In 2010, hackers from China attacked the networks of NSA and the Air Force and Navy. A large cache of classified documents was reportedly stolen by these attacks.

## **Existing Cyber Security Initiatives**

#### **Information Technology Act, 2000**

This act was enacted to provide legality to the operation carried out by means of online communication, which can be referred to as electronic commerce. This is a rising trend in recent days which has replaced paper communication.

The IT Act provides for

- lawful identification, use and legal protection to digital records and digital signatures in the government and its agencies,
- preservation of those government records,
- power to sue for the damage caused to these records,
- appointment of judicial bodies to render justice or solve the disputes that arise,
- the Cyber Appellate Tribunal to be established to deal with the disputes and
- consideration of hacking and other malicious activities as a punishable offence.

## **7.8 Chapter 7 â€¢ Cyber Security**

The Act amended in 2008 provides for

- impartiality in validation of digital record technology,
- recognition of publishing materials that have sexually explicit content or something that depicts children in such acts will be considered a punishable offence,
- provision of authority to inspect and gather information from any computer resource for the purpose of cyber security,
- provision to establish a national level nodal agency to protect Critical Information Infrastructure; the agency will also deal with research and development to protect it and
- provision to establish the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) to give instant responses.

Recently the apex court of India invalidated the provisions in Section 66A of the IT Act as it eclipsed the right of free speech and did not balance the right and restrictions on it.

## **Cyber Appellate Tribunal (CAT)**

As per the IT Act 2000, a person who is considered to be aggrieved by an order of any adjudicating officer may appeal before the Cyber Appellate Tribunal, which came into effect in 2009. This CAT is being headed by a chairperson, who is generally appointed the union government.

## **Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In)**

It is established as per the provisions in the IT Act, which was amended in 2008, to serve as a national level agency to

- forecast, collect, analyse and distribute information on incidents of cyber crimes,
- take emergency measures to handle such crimes,
- coordinate all the steps and activities performed as a response to the crime and
- provide advice, whitepapers that are related to the practices that are normally performed in the field of information security.

## **National Information Board (NIB)**

It is an apex agency headed by the national security advisor, which is represented by all the relevant departments that will in turn form a minimum information infrastructure board. It plays an important role by providing various policies for the information security of the country.

## **National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC)**

The National Crisis Management Committee, an apex body, headed by the cabinet secretary consists of secretary-level officers of the Indian government, plays a role of providing directions to the crisis management group during times of major crises.

#### **National Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NIIPC)**

The NIIPC is an agency that gathers information and looks into most possible cyber threats to key departments of the government like the defence department. It prepares assessment reports of the member intelligence groups and other enforcement agencies and also protects critical information in the country.

## **Challenges and Concerns of Cyber Security**

- (a) Lack of awareness among the public and institutions about cyber security.
- (b) Lack of trained manpower and qualified professionals to counter cyber threats.
- (c) The IT Act is old and redundant and is not keeping up with the changing cyber space.
- (d) Poor training infrastructure for cyber security professionals and insufficient supply of qualified trainers.
- (e) Lack of awareness about cyber security in the education sector.
- (f) Lack of private investment in the spheres of cyber security.
- (g) As against the required 5,00,000 cyber security professionals, we have only 50,000. We need at least one million trained professionals by 2020.
- (h) There is a lack of specialised courses in cyber security.
- (i) The scope of IT is expanding across all sectors in the country. The volume of cyber traffic and complexity of the IT ecosystem are rising in the country.
- (j) Fast-changing nature and intensity of threats.
- (k) Difficulty in tracing the origin of attack due to the complexity of cyber space and sophistication of criminals.

## **Government of India's Encryption Policy (Repealed)**

#### **What Is Encryption?**

Encryption is the process of encoding messages or information in such a way that only authorised people can decode them. The process makes use of an encryption key generated by an algorithm to convert plain text (actual message) into cipher string. This can only be read if decrypted using an appropriate decryption algorithm. As it is a highly sensitive process, it requires large computational infrastructures and skills. Famous messaging services such as Whatsapp, Viber, GoogleChat etc. make use of encryption.

## **How Did Encryption Originate?**

Encryption was originally used to secure highly classified military and diplomatic communication. However, with the entry of the Internet and the proliferation of online communication channels, the scope of encryption expanded. The need to protect privacy and information security led to the development of policies that made encryption a default characteristic of Internet-based applications.

## **What Was the Draft Encryption Policy?**

The government of India issued a new draft encryption policy in order to secure the cyberspace. It required that both individuals and businesses have to maintain the plain text for a minimum period of 90 days from the day it was sent to the recipient. Also, the government brought in regulations regarding the algorithms and key size of encrypted data and mandated that service providers enter into an agreement with the government to provide access to plain text.

## **Concerns Regarding the Draft Encryption Policy**

For businesses that store sensitive data, this policy defeats the purpose of encryption, as it is vulnerable to cyberespionage through trojans and malwares.

The policy also mandates that people will have to produce the plain text as and when demanded by law-enforcement agencies, under particular laws and regulations. The problem arises when a person may not be able to store plain text data due to a restricted storage space or errors on the communication device. Also, as mentioned before, these are vulnerable to attack by hackers. The other controversial side of the policy is that the responsibility of maintaining the plain text shall be on the user even in case of communication with a foreign entity.

Service providers who use any form of encryption as part of their service should enter into an agreement with the government of India for the purpose. While this could seem logical as the service is used by Indians, it is quite impractical as an online service provider can be anywhere in the world, and the number of such providers runs into thousands.

The government also proposed to prescribe the algorithm and key sizes for encryption. While the government wanted to have easy access to sensitive data through this principle, it also exposed the encryption ecosystem to attacks by prescribing a standard encryption algorithm and key size.

## **National Cyber Security Policy 2013**

The National Cyber Security Policy 2013 is a policy that is enacted with the provisions to protect information which includes personal, financial or sovereign information.

## **Key Highlights**

A few strategies that will be put in place to help the government achieve the objectives are listed below:

**Standing Committee Report on Cyber Crime, Cyber Security and Right to Privacy 7.11**

- National-level nodal agency to be formed to co-ordinate matters related to cyber security.
- Policy envisages each organisation to have its own security policy as per international standards.
- The policy also advises all the organisations to not only create a security policy but also to separate a specific amount from its budget for the effective implementation of security policies.
- As per the policy, the government will provide for assessment certification for the best practices and guidelines that have been enacted.
- For challenges and disputes that arise out of the cyber security policy, a separate legal framework must be created.
- The policy also plans to enforce a periodic audit and evaluation of adequacy and effectiveness of security of information infrastructure in India.
- A 24-hour operational response team, Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), to handle crises and proper early warning systems will be put in place in case of vulnerability to cyber threat.
- The policy plans to invest more in research and development programs to enhance the nation's cyber security, and the policy also encourages the organisation to use only certified IT products in sensitive security areas.

## **Standing Committee Report on Cyber Crime, Cyber Security and Right to Privacy**

The Committee chaired by Mr Rao Inderjit Singh submitted its report in February 2014. A few important recommendations of the Committee are listed below:

- The committee recommended the establishment of the National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre to guard against cyber attacks. The need for protecting important information is on the rise now as India is listed among the top five countries that has reported cyber crime cases. So, a protection centre is the need of the hour for the nation to protect its key government departments.
- The committee opts for a centralised body that can deal with the cyber crime cases reported nationwide. This centralized body will be connected to many cyber crime cells that will be set in each of the states and its districts.
- All government organizations should obtain proper International Standards Organization Certification related to information security.
- The committee also pointed out that there is need for government spending through budgetary cuts on innovative research and development for the advancement in the security of cyber space.
- Future programs or technologies like the Cloud under the National e-governance plan could prove to be risky if the Internet servers of critical sectors have their host outside the Indian border having cost advantages in their mind. So external hosting should be stopped as much as possible, and hosting within Indian borders should be encouraged.

## **7.12 Chapter 7 â€¢ Cyber Security**

â€¢ With respect to the IT Act 2000 and the National Cyber Security Policy of 2013, any action plan must come up with deadlines and targets, and the periodic review must be compulsory.

## **NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY AGENCY**

The strategic dimensions of securing the cyberspace are vast. As a first step towards this initiative, the Prime Minister's Office created the position of the national cyber security coordinator in 2014. But we do not have a National Cyber Security Agency (NCSA) that would develop policy and execute cyber missions as and when necessary.

First, a national institution for this purpose should be setup through an executive or legislative action, with a functional secretariat. The body, headed by the national cyber security coordinator, should consist of a team of permanent and semi-permanent staff that is technically proficient in cyber operations. The team's technical expertise should feature effective defence and fire-fighting capabilities in the event of a cyberattack.

Second, the agency needs to draft a cybersecurity doctrine much similar to the nuclear doctrine we hold. Third, the aforementioned organisations such as the National intelligence Grid, National Information Board etc. should perform a host of cyber operations in assessing and tackling cyberthreats. Considering the status of the NCSA, being appointed by executive/ legislative action, it should provide the lead for these institutions in terms of strategy and research.

Finally, with this body in place, we should also invest on building our offensive capabilities. This includes development of indigenous software that would invade and intercept digital networks.

Considering the large ambit of power given to this agency, it should report to the PMO and operate under parliamentary oversight.

## **Aadhaar and its Judgement**

The constitutional validity of the Aadhaar system (a nationwide biometric identification system) had been challenged before the Supreme Court (SC). This issue was put before a five-judge bench of the Court (Aadhaar Bench). One of the key issues is whether the norms for compilation of the demographic biometric data by the government violates the right to privacy. To answer this question, the SC had to first answer: whether there is a constitutionally mandated fundamental right to privacy or not. Due to conflicting judgments of the SC in the past, the Aadhaar Bench referred this question before a nine-judge bench of the SC (Privacy Bench) to finally determine whether a fundamental right to privacy existed or not.

A nine-judge bench of the SC has ruled that Indians enjoy a fundamental right to privacy, that it is intrinsic to life and liberty and thus comes under Article 21 of the Indian constitution.

The nine-judge bench, led by the then Chief Justice J. S. Khehar, pronounced a unanimous judgement even if the judges had slightly different arguments as to how privacy is intrinsic to right to life and liberty.

The SC has overruled verdicts given in the *M. P. Sharma* case in 1958 and the *Kharak Singh* case in 1961, both of which said that the right to privacy is not protected under the Indian constitution.

Emboldened by the SC's 'right to privacy' verdict, petitioners decided to move the court to settle the Aadhaar matter once and for all.

In 2017: Set up a five-judge bench to hear to hear a plea on the validity of the Aadhaar Act.

One of the first things the apex court did was to have the deadline for linking Aadhaar with various schemes to 31 March 2018.

Soon after, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) asked all banks to expedite linking of Aadhaar to bank accounts but said it was in line with the order the SC gave.

The apex court held that there was a need to balance an individual's privacy and the State's responsibility and The Aadhaar Act could not be declared unconstitutional because of citizens being denied services for want of the ID card. All the while, the Centre maintained that it would not deny people their due if they lacked an Aadhaar.

## Question 1: Whether the Aadhaar project creates or has tendency to create surveillance state and is, thus, unconstitutional on this ground?

#### Judgement:

- The architecture of Aadhaar as well as the provisions of the Aadhaar Act do not tend to create a surveillance state, said the majority order.
- According to the order, this is ensured by the manner in which the Aadhaar project operates. Drawing from representations made by the UIDAI and the government, the order stated:
  - o During the enrolment process, minimal biometric data in the form of iris and fingerprints is collected. UIDAI does not collect purpose, location or details of transaction. Thus, it is purpose blind. The information collected, as aforesaid, remains in silos. Merging of silos is prohibited. The requesting agency is provided answer only in 'Yes' or 'No' about the authentication of the person concerned.
  - o The authentication process is not exposed to the internet world.
  - o There are sufficient authentication security measures taken.
  - o There is an oversight by Technology and Architecture Review Board and Security Review Committee.
  - o During authentication, no information about the nature of transaction, etc., is obtained.
  - o The authority has mandated use of Registered Devices for all authentication requests.

## Question 2:Whether the Aadhaar Act violates the right to privacy and is unconstitutional on this ground?

## Judgement:

- Referring to the earlier decision by the SC that determined privacy to be a fundamental right, the order states that any restraint on privacy must meet three tests:
  - o backed by law
  - o legitimate state aim
  - o proportionality
- The existence of the Aadhaar Act and delivery of welfare benefits fulfil the first two requirements.
- The order noted that the third test of proportionality has also been met because:
  - o the purpose of the act is to ensure deserving beneficiaries of welfare schemes are correctly identified;
  - o it also achieves the balancing of two competing fundamental rights: right to privacy on the one hand and right to food, shelter and employment on the other.
- But the majority order directs that Section 7 of the Act, which says proof of Aadhaar number is necessary for receipt of certain subsidies.
- As per Section 7 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016, any individual who is desirous of availing any subsidy, benefit or service for which the expenditure is incurred from the Consolidated Fund of India, shall require to furnish proof of possession of Aadhaar number or undergo Aadhaar-based authentication. In case the individual does not have Aadhaar, he/she shall make an application for enrolment and the individual shall be offered alternate and viable means of identification for delivery of the subsidy, benefit or service.
- On that basis, CBSE, NEET, JEE, UGC, etc., cannot make the requirement of Aadhaar mandatory as they are outside the purview of Section 7 and are not backed by any law.

## Question 3: Whether the Aadhaar Act could be passed as 'Money Bill' within the meaning of Article 110 of the Constitution?

## Judgement:

â€¢ Since the purpose of the Aadhaar Act is to create unique identification so that citizens can avail government subsidy, benefit or service, the expenditure for which would be from the Consolidated Fund of India, it can be passed as a money bill.

## **Other Important Points**

- Aadhaarâ€“PAN Tax Linkage Maintained.
- The order upholds Section 139AA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 that makes it mandatory to quote Aadhaar when filing tax returns or for allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN).

## **No Mandatory use of Aadhaar to Open a Bank Account**

- The order found that such mandatory provision of Aadhaar to open a bank account or maintain an existing one does not stand the test of proportionality and 'violates the right to privacy of a person which extends to banking details'.
- No mandatory inking of Aadhaar with mobile number.
- The order found that since the circular issued by the Department of Telecommunications making such linkage mandatory was not backed by a law, it was illegal and unconstitutional.
- It is important to note that Justices Chandrachud and Bhushan delivered separate opinions in this case. While Justice Bhushan concurred with the majority view, Justice Chandrachud found the Aadhaar act 'to be declared as unconstitutional'. He also stated that the Aadhaar Act was not a money bill, 'Superseding the authority of Rajya Sabha constitutes as a fraud on the Constitution'.

## **Wannacry Attack â€“ 2017**

- WannaCry is a type of ransomware that infected the National Health Service (NHS) and other organizations across the globe including government institutions in China, Russia, the US and most of the Europe.
- WannaCry attack worstly affected many countries and India was one of them. The massive ransom ware attack affected NHS England which lead to cancellation of operations of some patients.
- The discovery of a vulnerability in Microsoft's Software named EternalBlue by the USA's National Security Agency lead to another attack.
- A hacker group called Shadow Brokers was responsible for the leak of exploit, however, following that Microsoft patched the vulnerability as soon as it happened.
- The problem came from older versions of Windows or those without Windows Updates, as these were not patched by Microsoft and were left open to attacks.
- Russia and India widely used Windows XP-one of he operating system most at risk, therefore, these counties were hit hard.
- Ransomware is a malware that stealthily gets installed in our PC or mobile device and holds our files or operating system functions for ransom.

## **7.16 Chapter 7 â€¢ Cyber Security**

- WannaCry restricts the user from accessing the data on their device until and unless the victim pays some ransom withing three days and if failed to do so, all the encrypted files are deleted and victim losses all the data.
- Ransomware targets our pictures, documents, files, and data that are personally invaluable.

## **Hemachandra Committee â€“ 2017**

- In order to strengthen cyber security system, an inter disciplinary panel was set up by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) which will examine various threats and will provide suggestions and measures to deal with it.
- The threats inherent in the existing or emerging technology will also be reviewed by the panel on an ongoing basis.
- The panel will also study various security protocols that are being adopted and will act as an interface with stakeholders.
- For the purpose of strengthening cyber security and resilience, the committee will also suggest appropriate polity interventions.
- The recommendations made by the expert panel on information technology examination and cyber security headed by Meena Hemachandra lead to this decision.
- The RBI has issued guidelines to banks, mandating cyber security preparedness for addressing cyber risks.

## **DNA Bill**

DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2018 is to create a national DNA database for solving crimes and identifying missing persons.

## **Forensic DNA Profiling**

- Forensic DNA Profiling has been proved valuable in solving cases that involve human body such as rape, human trafficking, etc. Is also helps in cases involving property such as theft, and dacoity.
- As per the NCRB records for 2016, these types of crimes are in excess of 3 lakhs per year.
- Only small proportion of them are subjected to DNA testing at present. The expansion in the use of above mentioned technology would result in both speedier justice delivery and increase in convention rates which currently stands at around 30%.

## **How DNA Profiling Works?**

- The genes encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which can be collected from blood, hair, skin cells and other bodily substances, are important tools in forensic science.
- Much like fingerprints, a person's DNA profile is unique, except in case of identical twins.
- It helps in establishing the identity of a suspect.

- Only small amount of genetic material is needed to create such a profile.
- Across the world, the use of DNA evidence helped exonerate a number of innocent people.

## Draft of DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2018

- National DNA Data Bank will be maintained on the basis of different categories, such as:
  - o Crime Scene Index
  - o Suspects' Index
  - o Offenders' index

with a view to 'facilitate identification of persons'.

â€¢ Through this, criminal investigation can become faster, civil cases such as 'parental disputes' can also be solved.

#### Issues with DNA Rill

- Consent is not required before bodily substances are drawn from a person accused and arrested for an offence punishable with either death or imprisonment for a term exceeding seven years.
- In all other cases, a person refusing to part with genetic material can be compelled to do so if a Magistrate has reasonable cause to believe that such evidence would help establish a person's guilt. Hence, there is no end to the State's power in coercing a person to part with DNA.
- In August 2017, nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India declared that the Constitution recognizes a Fundamental Right to Privacy.
