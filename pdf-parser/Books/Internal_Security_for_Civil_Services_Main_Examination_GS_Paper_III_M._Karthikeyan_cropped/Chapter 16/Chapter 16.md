# **ANNEXURE-4**

# Extracts of Guidelines on Communal Harmony\*

In the event of disturbances like communal disturbances/riots occurring then the maintenance of communal harmony, the prevention or avoidance of such disturbances and measures to provide protection and relief to the affected persons, is a prime responsibility of the State Governments.

# **Preventive meAsures**

- Preventing a communal riot is far more important than containing it. In this context, the District Administration should carefully assess the communal situation in the District on a regular basis and prepare a profile of the District. They should identify and specify areas which are prone to communal sensitivities and tensions. Areas should be identified as sensitive/ hyper-sensitive and, the position in this regard should be periodically reviewed and updated.
- The Station House Officers and other senior officials at the police station level should keep a close watch on the situation in such areas, apart from periodically visiting them for promoting public contact and interface with the civilian population and community leaders.
- Communally sensitive places should be identified in the riot prone areas for making necessary administrative arrangements. Police Stations/Posts should be set up in all sensitive/trouble-prone areas.
- In sensitive/hyper-sensitive areas the District Administration should anticipate possible developments that can happen on certain occasions, or in different kinds of situations, and prepare detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and contingency plans to deal with them, so that escalated situation/riots, etc., could be pre empted/prevented.
- Special attention needs to be given to developing mechanisms for intelligence and information gathering, and suitably integrating them with the

response mechanism. The intelligence feedback, especially from the ground level, should be effectively made use of by the administration.

## **Administrative Measures**

- At the State level meetings of the State level Integration Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Chief Minister, may be held at least once in a quarter to review the communal situation in the State.
- A nodal cell may be set up to act as a clearing house of information on the communal situation and it can maintain a database on various communal incidents, including details about the damage caused, lists of cases registered and progress of prosecution, etc. It could also study the patterns of communal disturbances in the State with a view to preparing appropriate preventive plans.
- In the field level, Police and the local intelligence agencies/institutions best know the elements, which have a record of, or could be expected to, create communal rifts, directly or indirectly. A list of such elements should be readily available in all Police Stations. So that immediate steps could be taken to isolate communal tensions, also preventive action could be taken against them wherever necessary.
- In communally sensitive towns and areas, Peace Committees or Quami Ekta Committees, comprising prominent citizens, community leaders and representatives of political parties, respectable organizations, etc., should be set up, and periodic contacts with them should be maintained by the concerned officers at the police station, sub-divisional and district levels.
- Women, who constitute a very vulnerable group in the context of communal tensions /riots, play an effective role in helping to defuse communal tensions and to prevent riots. Their fair representation in Peace Committees could help in containing riot situation.
- A Code of Conduct should be evolved in consultation with leaders of different communities for the observance of various festivals which should be widely publicized. Members of the Peace Committees should also be involved in educating the public about the contents of such Code, so as to ensure that festivals are observed in an amicable atmosphere without causing any annoyance to any individual or sections of society.
- Effective and meaningful action needs to be taken to curb and check rumours. Rumour mongers should be promptly brought to task. Channels of communications also need to be established with leaders of all communities, and strict action should be taken against anyone inflaming passions and stoking communal tension by intemperate and inflammatory speeches/ utterances. Use of the media and other channels for promptly scotching any rumours and keeping the people informed, should be ensured. Often, it is observed that the whole administration gets involved if any crisis breaks

out and this aspect gets overlooked. Proper assignment of nodal responsibility and modalities for information management is of critical importance, and should be ensured.

â€¢ Adequate steps should be taken to ensure that no damage is caused to places of worship, and provisions of "Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991" which provide punishment of imprisonment for damaging religious places and premises and for the establishment of special courts for speedy trial of all such offences, should be invoked. Also "The Religious Institutions (Prevention of Misuse) Act, 1988" should be enforced in a vigilante manner.

## **Personnel Policy**

- The composition of the police force, especially those deployed in communally sensitive areas, should be representative of the social structure of the region so as to ensure its credibility, and help in creating a feeling of confidence among all sections of the people.
- Creation of composite battalions of armed police which should include members of all communities including SCs/STs for use in maintaining communal peace and amity in the sensitive areas.
- Review of the training programmes for the police forces with a view to inculcating in them the attitudes of secularism and communal harmony, and conduct of special training/orientation programmes for the members of the State Police Force.
- Medical Relief Teams should be constituted in such a manner that, as far as possible, members of various communities are represented in it. The team should not only be technically competent but should have the qualities of sincerity and empathy for the victims.
- In communally sensitive and riot prone areas police and administrative officials of proven integrity, efficiency, impartiality and non-partisan outlook should be posted.

#### **Participation of Stakeholders**

In a communally-sensitive area, small shopkeepers, entrepreneurs and dailywagers are most prone to loss and damage to life and property, if the situation goes out of control, leading to arson or violence. They are most likely to face economic burden, due to loss of income or property, most of which is not covered under any type of insurance. They should encouraged more along with the voluntary organisations, which are working for promoting peace. The district administration should play a major role to mobilize support and encouraging them to maintain communal harmony, and diffusing tension if a communal situation arises.

#### **Role of Press/Media and awareness building**

A multi-media publicity and promotion campaign needs to be conducted, on a continuing basis, from time to time. "Catch them young" should be the philosophy for promoting the concept of communal harmony. Inspiring literature should be distributed among the school students, both in the government and in the private sector, and they should be encouraged to organise various competitions and talks on the subject of communal harmony.

The electronic media continuously shows images of specific incidents, which could lead to exaggerated perceptions about the incidents and lead to provoking sentiments and passions. Regular monitoring and briefing of the media in this context should be ensured.

#### **Enforcement Action and Monitoring of Cases**

Whenever any communal incidents are apprehended or occur, prompt and immediate preventive or enforcement action may be taken, including, imposition of prohibitory orders or curfew, as necessary, and strict and neutral enforcement of the same, apprehension or arrest of the potential miscreants/those indulging in violence, arson, etc., registration/institution of cases.

Special Courts may be set up, whenever the situation so demands, for the expeditious trial and disposal of communal riot cases. When a communal riot takes place and an Enquiry Committee/Commission is set up, it should be given a time specific mandate for completion of its inquiry. The State Governments should give priority to providing all manner of logistic support required by the Committee/Commission to enable it to submit its report on time. Its recommendations should be expeditiously implemented, say within 3 months and the Central Government should be kept informed.

#### **Relief and rehabilitation**

This could be the most important aspect in case communal disturbances or riots has occurred, so that the victims could not be misguided and they could be bring them into the main stream of the society. For that the following measures could be taken:

- Interim relief may be provided immediately to the individuals for any loss or damage suffered due to communal violence.
- Timely provision of essential supplies/services such as food, milk, medicines, water and electricity, etc., in areas affected by communal violence.
- It should be ensured that there is no discrimination on the ground of sex, caste, community, descent or religion.
- Wherever it becomes necessary to set up relief camps, proper arrangements for security and other appropriate amenities should be made, including arrangements for medical examination/assistance, etc.
