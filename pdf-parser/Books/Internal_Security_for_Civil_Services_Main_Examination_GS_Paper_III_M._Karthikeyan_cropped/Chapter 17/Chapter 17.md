# **ANNEXURE-5**

Extracts of the Report of the Committee Under the Chairmanship of Shri M.P. Bezbaruah to Look into the Concerns of the People of the North East Living in Other Parts of the Country

Ministry of Home affairs formed a Commission under retired IAS M P Bezbaruah, to look into concerns of people hailing from north-eastern states living and working in other parts of the country.

The strength of the Indian nation is its wide diversity. All our recommendations for increasing two way exchange and understanding of the people of the North East and the rest of India has one primary objective i.e. the ethnic and cultural difference of the North East should be a cause for celebration and not for raising barriers. They are meant to integrate the North East with the rest of India and not to segregate.

# **The Terms of Reference of the Committee**

- i. To examine the various kinds of concerns regarding security of the people hailing from the North Eastern States.
- ii. To examine the causes behind the attack/violence and discrimination against the people from the North Eastern States.
- iii. To suggest measure to be taken by the Government to address these concerns.
- iv. To suggest remedies to address these concerns including legal aspect of the issues.

# **Various Kinds Of Concerns Of The People from the North East Sense of Insecurity and vulnerability**

The people coming from the North East come into a social atmosphere which is different from their lifestyles back home and face the challenge of adjusting to the totally changed situation. They feel insecure and often are vulnerable to the problems in a large city. This drives them to stick together with their known friends and relatives.

### **Cultural Conflict and Wrong Perception**

The lifestyle of some people from the North East sometimes creates a wrong perception about morality.

## **Discrimination in Daily Life**

Most common forms of discrimination relate to over-charging of taxi/auto fares, passing lewd comments, teasing, molestation and being mistaken as foreigners at tourist places, museums etc. Discrimination, sexual harassment, physical assault by the local landlord/property dealers are also seen as major common concerns of many people, particularly women, from the North East.

## **Verbal Abuse and Racial Comments and Violence**

Verbal abuse, taunt and teasing because of their appearances was a common experience.

#### **Discrimination and Harassment at the Work Place**

They work mostly in the unorganized sectors. Lack of job security, arbitrary job condition, termination of job and also they suffered discrimination or harassment at work place.

#### **Discrimination and Apathy of the Law Enforcing Agencies**

Most complaints from the North East people have been about the behaviour and attitude of the police. Most of them did not trust police and were bitter about the attitude of discrimination and harassment faced when they go for registering cases.

#### **Other Issues and Factors**

The North East region is often categorized as an entity, there is a vast diversity among the people of the North East. It is estimated that there are more than 247 ethnic communities and tribes in the North East each with own language or dialects different traditions, customs and practices and in fact almost different cultures.

Very little employment opportunities are in the North East region, to fulfill their aspirations the youth are flocking to the urban areas even in their home states and many of them move to the Metros around India in search of whatever employment that they may get.

The general impression is that the North Eastern people are willing to work for less remuneration. It appears that in some cases local citizens, especially the educated unemployed youth feel threatened. This feeling is accentuated particularly as they look different with their mongoloid features. The nature of jobs and employment of a large number of the North East are low paid giving rise to other problems. There are also numerous cases of the young but gullible people from the North East falling prey to 'Agents' who lure them with promises of good jobs but end up either with poorly paid menial jobs or worse, thrown into human trafficking circles.

The committee also documents detail the racial experiences the North East people in the context of forms of racism as follows:

**External Appearances:** This refers to attitude associated with external appearances which include facial structures and colour of skin. This attitudinal stereo types and prejudices are expressed in racial slurs, comments and contours when persistently are labelled against individuals and groups in both overt acts and subtle ways tantamount to racial abuses. Repeated comments and contours causes hurt feels and when resisted, physical conflict take place e.g. the case of death of Nido Tania.

**Institutional Racism:** Institutional racism comes into play when victim of racist attacks seek to take remedy through the law. The racist prejudice is experienced here in form of attempts by the police to suppress or to make light of the crime, the tendency to cast aspersions on the character of the victim or complaints and refusal to register FIRs, or of putting unnecessary pressures on the victim to withdraw the case, etc. It is time to worry when the institutions of law-governed societies themselves become places where racism occurs.

#### **Remedial Measures**

The primary objective has been to bridge the gap in understanding to integrate and not segregate the people of the North East India into the broader national

## **A5.4 Annexure-5 • Extracts of the Report of the Committee Under...**

identity of India and to build connectivity not only physical but also connectivity of minds.

Many of the concerns relate to very complex socio-cultural issues and would require very comprehensive, focused attention of the law enforcing agencies, the society leaders, the civil society and the public policy makers.

Some of the remedial measures that appear to be necessary and feasible under the following categories:

- Creating awareness, which we take as a two way journey, though the primary focus is on creating awareness of the people outside North East about the least known and least understood region of the country.
- Quick, strong and fair action by law enforcing agencies.
- Institutional arrangements to provide guidance, help, information, counselling and orientation.
- Suitable legal/legislative measures to supplement the above efforts.

## **Framework of Action to be Taken to Address the Concerns**

The Committee deliberated on five main components which are crucial for tackling this matter. These are placed in order of priority as follows,

- i. The existence of a clear, stringent law that make such acts/incidents of varied nature punishable.
- ii. Strong and determined law enforcement agency which can prevent occurrence of such incidents and when they occur investigate quickly and professionally to bring the culprits to book.
- iii. Adequate support systems for the victims.
- iv. An efficient system for delivery of justice fairly and quickly.
- v. Socio-economic and cultural initiatives to handle the wider issues of educating the people creating awareness and removing wrong perceptions so that occurrence of such incidents is minimized.

To take care of such concerns, very wide ranging solutions are needs to be analyzed and this could be discussed by means of **Immediate, Short term and Long term** strategies.

#### **Immediate**

#### *Legal Measures*

The Committee recommends that either a new law should be promulgated as directed by the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi or IPC should be amended- in that order of preference. Whatever legislation is decided upon should have among other things the following specific provisions:

- i. The offence should be cognizable and non-bailable.
- ii. The investigation of the FIR should be completed compulsorily in 60 days by a Special Squad, investigated by a police officer not below the rank of

Deputy SP/ACP. A special prosecutor should be appointed to handle all such cases of atrocities.

iii. The trial should be completed in 90 days.

#### **Facilities for Legal Assistance**

Committee recommends the following steps:

- i. Panel of lawyers for legal assistance and consultation through mobile phone, e-mail, Whats App etc.
- ii. NE lawyers practicing at Delhi at different Courts may be given the preference to form a panel 50 percent members of panel may be women lawyers.
- iii. Legal awareness training and campaign for the North East Representatives from eight North East States.
- iv. Dissemination of information on legal rights to NE youths through pamphlets, brochures, CDs etc.
- v. Pro-active initiative for victim compensation and monetary assistance for to and fro journeys from North East.
- vi. Appointing North East practising lawyers as DLSA member as well as Coordinator for North East people on the behalf of DLSA.
- vii. The DLSA assistance is available only for the people below the poverty line. Such assistance should be available for people of the North East above the poverty line also in suitable cases.

#### **Strengthening Law Enforcement Agencies**

The Ministry of Home Affairs had issued an Office Memorandum on 10th May, 2012 and 3rd June, 2014 on the subject of discrimination and racial profiling faced by Indian citizens of North Eastern States in some parts of the country. The Office Memoranda, among other things, invite attention to the following aspects:

- Sensitization and training of the police personnel/law enforcement agencies;
- Minimizing delays in investigation of cases of atrocities against SCs/STs;
- Improving the quality of investigation;
- Recruitment of sufficient number of persons belonging to SCs/STs or minorities as police personnel, programmes;
- Creating awareness among vulnerable sections of the society and legal recourse open to them;
- Adopting appropriate measures for swift and salutary punishment to public servants found guilty of neglect of duty and violence against SCs/STs;
- Setting up of special courts; and
- Improving the effectiveness of schemes developed for the welfare and rehabilitation of SCs/STs who are victims of crime.

## **A5.6 Annexure-5 • Extracts of the Report of the Committee Under...**

The Office Memorandum also talks about 'Zero Tolerance Policy', so far as the crime against the people from the North Eastern States is concerned, need for proactive action in cases like eve teasing, stalking, passing derogatory remarks, etc., desirability of outreach programme from the Police side, regular quarterly meetings with the community leaders and formation of Area Security Committees.

# **Special Police Initiatives**

The Committee strongly suggest creation of Fast Track Courts for handling the cases relating to the North East people, particularly those which are racially motivated and heinous crimes against North East women and children.

- i. Specially designated public prosecutors should be appointed for cases involving people from the North East. They should also be properly trained and sensitized.
- ii. Creation of a special squad supervised by the North East Special Police Unit would go a long way in speedy justice in criminal cases. The squad could be manned by the people specially selected for such purpose and could be specially trained and sensitized about the problems of the North East people.

## **The Bonding Power of Sports**

The Committee recommends the following:

- i. Ministry of DoNER/North Eastern Council and the Sports Ministry should institutionalize mechanism for review and implementation of the decisions.
- ii. In addition, the Committee recommends that the Ministry should take steps to hold regular national/international events in the North East as such events create greater harmony and better understanding.
- iii. The Ministry should, therefore, review the status of present facilities and make an assessment if they are suitable for such events. If not, one such facility should be created in every state of the North East, for example, cricket in one, football in another, tennis in somewhere else
- iv. Indigenous games of the North East should be promoted.

#### **Educating the People About the North East**

The Committee recommends that when the next review of NCERT takes place, the above said concerns should be adequately reflected.

- i. Action taken by the Ministry on these recommendations should be uploaded to a North East link within the Ministry's website.
- ii. Nevertheless, detailed socio-economic study of the nature of student's migration from the North East would be worthwhile as it will provide valuable insight for planning of higher education in the region.

## **Information & Broadcasting and Media to Focus on the North East**

The steps taken by the Ministry should be given due publicity. For this purpose, among other things, creation of a North East website was suggested.

Timely implementation of many of the initiation is important. Therefore, there should be regular and systematic interaction for coordination between MHA/l&B and DoNER.

It is important for the media to reach out to put the North East on the National centre stage. How to sensitize the national media about the North East is something for I&B to consider-- at the least prime coverage should be given to the North East Region in the media facilities under its control. It should provide uplink facilities to all the States. The police forces in these States should be provided with O.B. vans.

#### **Role of the State Bhawans**

Considering that a very large number of people are migrating from the North East, it is essential for the Bhawans/State Governments to play the role of informing and educating the people on their arrival. For example, those in search of jobs or seeking admissions in institutions need proper certificates about residence, caste, tribe etc. People should be informed about these essential requirements preferably before they leave their home states.

For example in Bangalore and in Munirka, how wrong reporting or rumours can cause serious damage to community relations and lead to law and order problems. Quick response to handle such unconfirmed rumours is essential to help the law enforcing agencies. The North East Forum in collaboration with Ministry of DoNER should set up such a mechanism for quick response.

The Bhawans should provide relief and rehabilitation facilities for people of the State in distress.

#### **Accommodation and Problems of Rent**

The committee suggests that MHA and DoNER should take the lead in coordinating with the Ministries like Urban Development to find out suitable land and start construction of suitable hostels for students/working women etc. where North East could be given appropriate reservation.

Under the Bhagidari Scheme the local administration holds periodic meetings with RWAs for discussing such issues and sorting them out amicably. The committee proposed that such meetings should be made a part of the system and local police should also be involved in the interaction. It was mentioned that response of the North East organizations to such meetings was not adequate. The North East network should ensure that the meetings are widely published and adequately attended.

#### **Implementation**

- i. An affective monitoring mechanism should be built into the system. It recommends that a high level committee should be set up under the Home Ministry with representatives of Ministry of DoNER, Ministry of Home Affairs, Resident Commissioners, Delhi Police and suitable representation from the Civil Society Organizations working for the concerns of the North East people.
- ii. The Committee should have powers to ensure implementation and the powers and functions should be clearly laid down. The powers given to the Committee should also enable it to fix accountability and the concerned Ministries should act upon the decisions of the Committee within a specified time. The committee should meet at least once a quarter and review the implementation of the many initiatives.
- iii. The nodal officer from police proposed to be placed in the MHA should be the convener and the member secretary of the committee.
- iii. The results of review by the committee should be uploaded in the network of North East Police Cell and later on should be linked to be North East network recommended by us.

## **Short Term**

#### *Legal Measures*

- Use of the Information Technology system for reaching out to the largest number of affected people. In addition, a booklet should be prepared containing all the provisions, how to register cases, where to go in case of difficulties and how to monitor that the system operates effectively.
- The Committee feels that sensitizing the law enforcing agencies about the people and the culture of the North East will go a long way in creating a suitable atmosphere

## **Strengthening Law Enforcement Agencies**

- The Committee suggest a process of comprehensive, computerized database for keeping track of the people from the North East. This recommendation is part of a wider proposal for creating a North East Centre covering many other aspects of the problems that are being discussed.
- The commission felt that a comprehensive, clear, readable booklet, not just compilation of all government orders on all major instructions on steps taken by Police for redressing the problems of the people from the North East, be prepared, printed and widely circulated. Every Police Station must have a copy of it readily available.

## **Creating Awareness and Promoting Understanding**

- Cultural exchange programmes for students in schools and colleges should be properly organized and funded by the concerned departments.
- MHA in consultation with Ministry of Defence should work out the modalities for sensitization of the armed forces personnel. This sensitization is not only to the armed forces but also to the other public service authorities.
- A nodal officer should be designated in these Ministries particularly in MHRD/Culture/l&B and Sports and Tourism to monitor implementation of the many proposed schemes. The nodal officer should also have links to Ministry of DoNER/NEC, as well as weblink to the proposed North East Centre data bank.

## **The Bonding Power of Sports**

- The Committee feels that Ministry of DoNER/North Eastern Council could evolve a system to monitor progress of the Sports Ministry's schemes in the region and also to coordinate with the State Governments for speedy implementation.
- The Sports Ministry should offer all assistance including subsidies to attract private franchise tournaments to the North East.

#### **Educating the People About the North East**

- The metro universities outside the North East could make projects on North East as mandatory part of course curricula. Even in schools, project work on North East related themes should be built into the system.
- Most students come to Delhi because they have a fascination for the brand image of the Universities and colleges. A question can be asked, if foreign universities can come and lure students why can't DU/JNU or even some colleges open campus/centers in the North East. Horizons of education and learning systems has changed tremendously and unbelievably in recent times. The committee believes such benefits in brand, quality and experience that the Delhi institutions provide can be made available in the North East. MHRD/UGC may find it worthwhile to explore such out of the box solutions in the context of huge migration of students from the North East.

#### **The Rich Culture of the North East as a Means of Integration**

• For speedy implementation of projects, MHA, DONER, Min of Culture should evolve some mechanism of monitoring and coordination. DONER should examine the issue very carefully and device some pragmatic mechanism for coordination with all Ministries on implementation of schemes in the North East.

# **A5.10 Annexure-5 • Extracts of the Report of the Committee Under...**

- To improve perception about the North East, the cultural programmes should also target the lower and middle class in metros. The ongoing programmes generally are considered to be elitist. The zonal Cultural Centres could consider organising such cultural festivals in selected RWAs areas every year.
- All the North Eastern States should also have a Calendar of Cultural event in Delhi and other Metros, as well as within the State—preferably on a fixed date every year.

# **Promoting Tourism as a Means of Creating Awareness and Understanding**

- The revised and redesigned Incredible India campaign should have a special focus on North East preferably with a proper branding.
- Tourism is a private sector driven industry and therefore the Ministry of Tourism/Ministry of DoNER should take steps to ensure that the private sector play a lead role.
- Tourism is an ideal instrument for creating understanding and harmony. The Committee feels that the continuation of the LTC scheme for North East would go a long way in creating awareness.
- Ministry of DoNER should also try to associate respectable and popular icons from the field of culture, sports, music, etc. to be their brand Ambassadors for the North East to promote this campaign.

## **Information & Broadcasting and Media to focus on the North East**

- Some buildings/institutions of public importance should be named after North East landmarks—rivers, hills, tribes, icons.
- Media should be careful while covering race related cases in order to prevent escalation of tension leading to increase of such incidents; they should rather be agents of tension diffusion.
- Social sites like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc. should be watched, edited and strictly regulated and posting of provocative statements and pictures should not be allowed.

## **Role of the Private Sector**

We recommend the following initiatives offered by FICCI and hope that MHA and Ministry of DoNER would carry this initiative to other organizations like CII, ASSOCHAM, **PHD** CHAMBER etc.:

- i. The industry news letters can regularly focus on the concerns of the North East to the members of the associations.
- ii. FICCI can place brochure/materials on the North East if such materials are provided by Ministry of DoNER in each conference that they hold across the country as part of the background materials.

- iii. MHA or the Ministry of DoNER should design some attractive readable materials on 'Understanding Our North East'. It will be even better if it could be linked up with Ministry of Tourism so that awareness is followed by experience of the tourists. Such materials should be provided to the industry organizations for action as above.
- iv. Private Sector can also play a very important role in recruitment of youth from the North East. Industry organizations can sensitize their members suitably on this social responsibility.

## **Role of the Universities**

Universities have a very important role to play in the process of mutual understanding. While the tensions are less pronounced in the academic environment, there is still much to be done.

- Promoting Cultural awareness through Orientation sessions for students, where North East students should be encouraged to participate.
- Setting up of a Website for information and guidance;
- Appointment of Nodal officer for North East in every college;
- Setting up a North East Cell in the University;
- Setting up admission help desks;
- Conducting Security coordination meetings;
- Organising Self defence classes along with promoting participation in NCC and NSS activities;
- Programs to organise Street plays on NE region of India.

## **What People from North East Have to Do**

- Education and sensitization of the people before arrival and after arrival in the metros about ways of living and adjust to the culture in which they have to live and work.
- Greater efforts for interaction with the local communities in which they live and the need for involving the police and district administration to facilitate such two way interactions for a healthy living atmosphere;
- A pragmatic orientation and proper follow up by the North Eastern communities should be an important part of addressing the concerns of the North Eastern people.

#### **Organizing Workers on North East Platform**

• Workers from the North East could form some organization/professional association enabling them to redress their grievances under the relevant provisions of the existing laws. Such a move will go a long way in protecting their interest. Such organizations can be affiliated to the National level trade bodies thereby strengthening the integration process. The problem of how to organise them and how to provide financial or other assistance

# **A5.12 Annexure-5 • Extracts of the Report of the Committee Under...**

for funds for the initial process of organisation could be examined by the Labour Department/Ministry.

• Information about procedures, legal recourse available etc. should be disseminated.

## **Need for Coordination**

- Every institution/organization providing services/security to the people of North East in Delhi and other Metros and having any institutional mechanism should link them to the North East database network proposed by the committee. Till the time that the North East database network is operational, the North East Police Cell should provide the linkages to all such agencies.
- Ministry of Tribal Affairs should reach out to the North East communities in urban areas for providing the necessary facilities. A nodal officer should be designated for the purpose, which should upload information in the North East Website.

## **Long Term**

## *Legal Measures*

The committee felt that within the broad framework of our Constitution the legal, strategic and philosophical aspects of the demand for an anti-racial law should be debated and in the long run a suitable decision should be taken. For the immediate short run problems of the North East people, the steps enumerated by us above for a specific law or specific amendment to the IPC should be taken up.

# **A Visible Face of the North East in Delhi**

- Establishment of a North East Centre in Delhi;
- Sustained, systematic and continuous exposure of the North East to the rest of India and the world;
- Strengthen the existing organization in the short run and in the long run to build a comprehensive umbrella organization.
- The Centre should be an autonomous institution preferably in PPP mode with carefully planned, very high level of responsible management. It should be given a name evocative of the rich culture and tradition of the North East. It should have the following functions or wings, but the list is only illustrative:
  - i. A comprehensive database and arrangement for networking; The proposed networking should be extended to cover social networking in addition to security networking, with the objective of sharing information and creating bonding with various organizations. This database centre should be immediately started by DoNER within its existing facilities even before the permanent centre becomes operational. The Centre should have provision for permanent

exhibition and sale of North East handicrafts, handlooms and cuisine. It should be linked to DiIIi Haat for this purpose.

- ii. The Centre should also have facilities for cultural performances, dance, theatre, art exhibition. For cultural purposes, the centre should function as an outreach of Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts.
- iii. It should also have one wing of the extension of the national museum depicting products from the North East which are not on display at the national museum.
- iv. The Centre should have, link to the database facilities for 24x 7 assistance to the North East people in distress. This facility should be linked to the North East police cell as well as to the State Bhawans and also to other prominent NGO Organizations which are scrutinized and approved by the Centre.
- v. It should have a continuous orientation programme for new arrivals, on life in the metro cities. The orientation centre should also have facilities for spoken Hindi classes/Local languages on voluntarily basis. Similarly, facilities should be created where necessary for people to learn languages/dialects of the North East if they wish.
- vi. The Centre should also provide facilities for voluntary registration of people from the North East and create a basic profile. To encourage such registration some incentives may be provided in utilization of the facilities in the centre.
- vii. The Centre should have professional trauma care facility as well as counseling for those who are in distress.
- viii. The centre should provide the first point of contact for legal advice and shall have connection to DSLSA.
- ix. The Centre should also have practical outreach research and documentation on the problems of the people of the North East in Delhi. Such research facilities need not duplicate the existing excellent facilities in institutions like Centre for North East in Jamia Millia, North East Centre in JNU etc., but should be ideally linked to them.
