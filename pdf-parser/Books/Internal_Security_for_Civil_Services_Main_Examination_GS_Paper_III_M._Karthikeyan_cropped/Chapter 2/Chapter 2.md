*Terrorism is the tactic of demanding the impossible and demanding it at gunpoint.*

 *–* Christopher Hitchens

The biggest epidemic today that tears the social fabric and peace apart is terrorism. Terrorism is very diverse; it spreads across different dimensions – political and religious, and in different levels – global and local. These diversity pockets form a spectrum where it moves from one dimension to another and from one level to another. It even exhibits various faces at various points of time.

Terrorism is not new as it can be traced back to at least the 1st century when a group of people killed the collaborators of the Roman Empire in the Judea province. The origin of "terrorism" can be traced to the Reign of Terror of the last decade of the 18th century during the French revolution.

A shift in the nature of terrorist activities was seen across many countries post the Second World War. From Europe it shifted to the Middle East, Africa

### **2.2 Chapter 2 • Terrorism**

and Asia with the rise of nationalistic and anti-colonial groups. Another fillip to terrorism was given on 11 September 2001. It brought to the fore the modern meaning terror activities as we see and experience today.

The terrorism that we see today is global in character and reach. It is marked by a large number of transnational groups predominantly having religious fundamentalism as their core ideology. With Osama Bin Laden's Al-Qaeda and Afghan's Taliban to the latest ISIS religious fundamentalism-based terrorism, the phenomenon of terrorism seems to never die. If we suppress it in one form, it re-emerges in another form only more ruthless and more lethal.

The first step towards combating terrorism is by understanding what terrorism is and what it is not.

### **Terrorism – Definition**

*According to the Global Terrorism Index, terrorism is defined as 'the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation'.* 

*The Index is released by the Institute of Economics and Peace every year and India is the 6th most affected country in terrorism as given by the indices in 2014.*

Despite terrorism attaining worldwide recognition as a global phenomenon, attempts to arrive at a globally accepted definition of terrorism have proved to be futile. The main reason being one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. Further, history is replete with examples of state-sponsored clandestine criminal acts and assassinations in other states to destabilise the other state and derive benefits out of the act. There is political resistance to have a universally acceptable definition of terrorism.

Politicians use the term terrorism for political purposes and paint their opponents as monsters. Academicians have tried to arrive at a definition much more objectively from a detached position. People seek to capture the essence of terrorism based on which side of the fence they sit.

However, be it politicians or academicians the definition of terrorism implying murder or characterising it as intrinsically wrong is agreed upon. This means we arrive at a moral conclusion without moral skepticism or debate. This discussion ends even before it begins.

Let us examine the definitions of 'terrorism' as proposed by different organizations:

- (a) *League of Nations Convention (1937): describes terrorism as "all criminal acts directed against a State and intended or calculated to create a state of terror in the minds of particular persons or a group of persons or the general public."*
- (b) *Article 2(1) of the UN General Assembly's Draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (fifty-fifth session, 2000) provides that;*

- (1) *Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person, by any means, unlawfully and intentionally, causes:*
  - (a) *Death or serious bodily injury to any person; or*
  - (b) *Serious damage to public or private property, including a place of public use, a State or government facility, a public transportation system, an infrastructure facility or the environment; or*
  - (c) *Damage to property, places, facilities, or systems referred to in paragraph 1(b) of this Article, resulting or likely to result in major economic loss, when the purpose of the conduct, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a Government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing an act.*

*The Defense Department of The United States of America defines terrorism as "the unlawful use of violence or threat of violence to instill fear and coerce governments or societies. Terrorism is often motivated by religious, political or other ideological beliefs and committed in the pursuit while taking into account these universally recognized definition, of goals that are usually political."*

What is considered unlawful? Is it the violation of the Geneva Convention, United Nations Resolutions or the US Federal Law? Well, in any country, if the law of the land on terrorism is violated, it becomes an act of terrorism. There are instances of some powerful nations that have used violence unlawfully. The threat of violence can also be an act of terrorism – one has no answer to such questions.

In a nutshell, we do not have a universally accepted definition of terrorism, though we have a mental moral picture of what terrorism is. We limit ourselves to what conventionally has been portrayed as terrorism by public and media alike. Terrorism is any violent activity done by a non-state actor against common people or their property for political purposes. This definition would satiate our need for now.

*Non-state actors: An organization that has no direct or indirect links with the government and its organisation but has commendable political influence.*

### **Types of Terrorism**

Grouping all terrorists or terrorist activities under one umbrella is not possible because their variety and will only lead to poor understanding in combating terrorism. Understanding what we are dealing with is the first step to the battle against terrorism. Terrorists have different goals and objectives. The nature of terrorism varies in accordance with the objectives. The commonly distinguished types of terrorists are:

### **Ethno-nationalist Terrorism**

Daniel Byman defines ethnic terrorism as deliberate violence by a sub-national ethnic group to advance its cause.

# **2.4 Chapter 2 • Terrorism**

Ethno-nationalists and separatists committed terror acts and dominated their agenda around the world for more than five decades until religious terrorism occupied the centre stage. The two terrorist organisations which justified their acts of violence were the Irish Republican Army and Euskadi ta Askatasuna (ETA or Basque homeland and freedom) against the UK and Spain, respectively. Most of these violent acts usually focus on their motive of creating a separate state or the elevation of the status of an ethnic group. Tamil Nationalist groups in Sri Lanka, especially the LTTE, which fought war against Sri Lanka armed forces, since the 80's till the 2009 war, is the world's famous terrorist organisation. Insurgent groups in northeast India are also examples of ethno-nationalist terrorist activities.

# **Religious Terrorism**

Though the 21st century saw the decline of ethno-nationalist terrorism, it ushered in a new wave of global terrorism with religious inspiration and very high levels of brutality and lethality. Present-day religion-centered terrorist activities are global in nature. According to Hoffma, the terrorists are motivated wholly or partially by religious ideals, who consider violence as their divine duty or a holy act. It gives them different ways of legitimisation and justification when compared with other terrorist groups, and these unique factors make religious terrorism more dangerous, more brutal in committing heinous acts.

# **Rise of ISIS**

# **What Is ISIS?**

The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), also known as ISIL\*, is a transnational militant organisation and an unrecognised proto-state that has received global attention since 2014. It began as the Iraqi wing of Al-Qaeda and later rebranded itself after a couple of years with its current name, ISIS. It carries forward anti-Western radicalism similar to Al-Qaeda and operates much more brutally in controlling occupied territory. Through its harsh methods and radical ideology, ISIS seeks to establish an independent theocratic state in the Middle East, free from western influence.

### **Where Do They Operate From?**

As the name suggests, ISIS has spread its base, capturing large territories on both sides of the Iraq–Syria border. The group has a number of oil fields under its control, which keep its day-to-day warfare and militant operations running. At its peak, the ISIS is said to have traded oil through black markets to the tune of \$3 million each day.

\* ISIL: Islamic state of Iraq and Levant (Levant is the name of a geographical area in the Middle East).

Though its strategy of geographical expansion is based on violence and warfare, ISIS establishes a concrete governing establishment once it fortifies captured territories. Similar to modern states, it has a bureaucratic structure, featuring governors and legislative and financial bodies, compositely headed by a Caliph, who holds the ultimate power.

Of late, ISIS has been pushed back into its territories by coalitions of Western militaries led separately by the United States (US), France and Russia. Notable cities recaptured by Western forces include Aleppo and Palmyra.

# **What Are Global Powers Doing to Counter ISIS?**

As ISIS has destabilised the conventional governance of Middle Eastern countries, several nations have launched counter efforts to tackle the group's advances to other parts of the world. The US-led coalition titled as the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) formulated a strategy to expose ISIL's true nature, cutting off ISIL's funding and executing military operations to defeat it. Similarly, under the leadership of Saudi Arabia, around 34 Muslim countries have come together to form the Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism, which seeks to fight against the terrorist group.

### **Do They Still Pose a Threat to Global Peace?**

Despite the recent setbacks and the creation of military fronts against it, ISIS operates through its offshore cadres, triggering a number of terrorist attacks. By deploying a systematic hierarchy, the group covertly recruits cadres through its radical religious propaganda, mostly from developing countries to expand operations. With this network of satellite units around the world, it triggers terror attacks that torment unsuspecting civilians. Thus, its ability to operate with limited geographical presence and destabilise peaceful world order is quite potent and has to be seriously addressed.

### **Leftist Terrorism**

History is studded with several cases of violence perpetrated by the peasant class against the ruling elite, which is called the leftist ideology.

However, it was Marx's and Engels's writings that actually acted as the ideological basis for the left and the subsequent violent movements. Lenin and Mao Tse-tung furthered these movements with their writings and actions. Leftist ideologies believe that all the existing social relations and socio-politico state structures in the capitalist society are exploitative in character and a revolutionary change through violent means is essential.

Few example, leftist groups are the Red Army Faction of former West Germany, the Red Brigades of Italy, the 17th November Movement of Greece, People's Revolutionary Army and the Motoneros of Argentina. The Maoist groups in India and Nepal are also leftist groups.

### **Rightist Terrorism**

Right-wing groups generally are conservative in nature. These people either want status quo or want to return to a specific time in the past which they feel should be conserved. At times these right wing groups might assume ethnic/racist/religious character too. They may act as a pressure group and use violence or threat of violence as a means to force the government in to acquiring a territory or in to intervening in the affairs of a neighbouring country, the best example being the Nazi party of Germany. Closer home, the Tamil organisations supporting the cause of Tamil Eelem in Sri Lanka is an example for rightist terrorism. Violence perpetrated against migrant communities citing the concept of "sons of the soil" also comes under this category of terrorist violence. Some organisations in Assam and other northeast states are examples. It is to be noted here that religion can play a supportive role to rightist violence.

Examples include the Nazism in Germany, Fascism in Italy, Ku Klux Klan (a white supremacy movement in the US), Green Jackets of Denmark, etc.

### **State Terrorism**

When the government systematically uses terror mechanisms to control its population, it becomes a state terrorism. Here terrorism is entirely carried out by those holding power. They are the government in a country and they are not by a non-governmental organisation or non- state actor. In its original form it was witnessed during the 1793 French Revolution when thousands of executions were carried out by the Jacobins, which is often cited as the first instance of state terrorism. Rulers have been using this terror mechanism for centuries to control their subjects. Arguably almost every dictator in history has applied terror mechanism for controlling his population. More contemporary examples would be the use of violence by Saddam Hussein against the Kurds and other authoritarian regimes in the Middle East.

### **State-Sponsored Terrorism**

State-sponsored terrorism is a very old practice that existed in the empires of Rome, Byzantium, Asia and in Europe. The period between the 1960s and the 1970 saw the resurfacing of the state-sponsored terrorism on a large scale. Similar to religious terrorism, state-sponsored terrorism also has caused a wide transformation in the nature of terrorist activities.

In the modern era, various nations have incorporated terrorism as a deliberate tool of foreign policy. State-sponsored terrorism differs from other forms in that it is initiated to achieve certain defined foreign policy goals rather than seeking media attention or targeting the potential audience. A cost–benefit analysis would show that state-sponsored terrorism is the most effective means of terrorism from the standpoint of the perpetrator.

Central Asia had been the hub of state-sponsored terrorism in the 19th century. A few examples are Russians' support to Slavs in the Balkans and Bulgaria's exploitation of the Macedonian revolutionary terrorists against Yugoslavia after World War I. Later during the Cold War era, the Western powers under the auspices of the US and the Soviet Union supported all kinds of nationalist, communist and anti-communist rebels to further their own foreign policy agenda. Countries like Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya and North Korea fell victim to this state-sponsored political violence. India too is a victim of state-sponsored terrorism by Pakistan since Independence.

# **Causes of Terrorism**

The most common causes of terrorism as concluded out of many debates by various experts are listed below:

- extreme poverty,
- unequal distribution of resources,
- economic exploitation,
- over-population,
- illiteracy,
- unemployment,
- extremism and sectarianism,
- lack of opportunity,
- weak social bond,
- political instability,
- deprivation of fundamental rights,
- institutional evasions,
- anathema of social injustice,
- social imbalance and regional disparities,
- proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD),
- impact of proxy war of Afghanistan (1979–1989),
- policies against Islamic Revolution of Iran (1979) and
- political insurgency.

A few of the widely accepted causes are explained below:

### **Ethno-Nationalism**

They are a group of people who desire to break away from the union government and wish to independently form a terrorist group. Ethno-nationalism as a cause has been in the scene since the time of the World War, and in the weakening of imperial powers many notable groups like the Jewish Irgun Zvai Leumi in Palestine which fought British rule attained self-rule in the Jewish state.

There are many minority groups who wish to garner independence within many countries in the world. So ethno-nationalism is an important source of terrorism and to recognise it and actually counter it requires a politically inclusive approach to make sure that the grievances of the minority groups are achieved.

# **Alienation/Discrimination**

Alienation is considered to be a major cause especially in Europe where people from poorer Muslim countries, who go to school and work, are often discriminated. These people who could not get adapted to the culture of the host nation look for their diaspora and are often alienated with growing sentiments which will make them take conservative and extremist ideologies.

# **Religion**

It is highly believed today that terrorism is a major cause for terrorism. Terrorism is not preached by any religion, but by some spiritual leaders. Religion as a cause is highly referred to as Islamic Fundamentalism. One good example is the global Salafi-jihad, a conservative revivalist movement, which aimed to redeem the lost Muslim glory from Morocco to Philippines. The true hazard that the religious doctrines poses is its attitude to encourage the attacks that are more aggressive in nature. There has been an increase in the number of terrorist attacks since 1980.

# **Socio-economic Status**

Poverty, lack of opportunity, inequality in resource distribution and lack of upward mobility in society are the socio-economic factors leading to terrorism. The awareness of various opportunities that are put forth by globalisation has increased the frustration and humiliation among the under-privileged. This feeling of being left out is a signal to terrorist organisations to the society towards them. Unfortunately, bringing development to the under-privileged is the only way to counter this and that might take a very long time.

### **Political Grievances**

Another major cause for individuals to join terrorist groups is the lack of political inclusiveness and the grievances against the political order. Expressing political will in frustration can lead to violence as an alternative to the existing political system that exists. These political desires are not out of the desire to create a new state but to change the current order.

# **Means of Terrorism**

The time-tested strategies used by terrorists are attacks on persons and property using fire arms, bombs, IEDs, grenades, landmines hostage-taking, hijacking and forcible take-over of buildings, especially government/public buildings. These could be categorised as conventional means of terrorism. Further, the trending strategy today is suicide attacks and kidnapping. There is impending danger of terrorists resorting to WMD (nuclear, chemical or biological), cyber terrorism and environmental terrorism.

### **Environmental Terrorism**

Environmental terrorism is the intentional damage caused to environmental resources so as to deprive the others of their use. For instance, on the orders of Saddam Hussein several oil wells were ignited to cover Kuwait in smoke during the GW I. Similarly during GW II, the forces of Hussein retreated, set ablaze all oil wells so as make them unusable for the NATO forces.

### **Weapons of Mass Destruction**

WMDs are weapons that can cause heavy and indiscriminate damage. According to NATO a Weapon of Mass Destruction is a weapon that is capable of a high order of destruction and of being used in such a manner as to destroy people, infrastructure, or other resources on a large scale. The commonly recognized Weapons of Mass Destruction are nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. It is a matter of great relief that acquiring, storing and using these WMDs require a high level of knowledge and skills that the terrorist organisations are yet to acquire as of now.

### **Chemical Weapons**

Any weapon which uses chemicals to cause severe human death or physical or psychological suffering and harm is considered a chemical weapon. They may take the form of poisoned arrows, arsenic smoke and noxious fumes, etc. In the First World War, chlorine and phosgene gases were released from canisters on the war field and were dispersed by the wind.

According to the Chemical Weapons Convention signed in 1993, any toxic chemical, regardless of its origin, is considered as a chemical weapon if it is used for purposes that are prohibited. The toxic chemicals that have been used as chemical weapons, or have been developed for use as chemical weapons, can be categorised as choking, blister, blood or nerve agents. The most well-known agents are as follows: choking agents – chlorine and phosgene; blister agents (or vesicants) – mustard and lewisite; blood agents – hydrogen cyanide; nerve agents – sarin, soman, and VX.

Iraq used chemical weapons on Iran during the war in the 1980s, and again used mustard gas and nerve agents on Kurdish residents of Northern Iraq in 1988. The standout usage of chemical weapons, however, is USA's use of Agent Orange in the NAM war. Very recently, it is alleged that the Syrian Governmental Forces have used chemical weapons on its own citizens in the ongoing internal power struggle.

### **Nuclear Weapons**

A nuclear weapon is ammunition that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission (fission bomb) or a combination of fission and fusion (thermonuclear weapon). They release huge quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter. It is a widely known fact that the engineering skill and equipment needed to build the simplest form of nuclear weapon, a "gun" type bomb is not particularly complex. Any organised group can develop a nuclear weapon. The difficulty, however, lies in the non-availability and the complicated

# **2.10 Chapter 2 • Terrorism**

process and the cost involved in enriching uranium. This is what makes it difficult for the non-state actors and terrorist groups in assembling a nuclear weapon.

# **Biological Weapons**

Biological weapons are weapons that use natural or modified biological matter to inflict large-scale death and harm to human beings. It is relatively a new form of terrorist activity with terrorist groups being able to access and exploit the advancements in biotechnology. The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines a bio-terrorism attack as "the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria or other germs (agents) used to cause illness or death in people, animals, or plants." These are spread though air, water or food. To make things worse they are extremely difficult to diagnose since it may take anywhere between hours and several days for visible symptoms to appear.

During World War I, Germany is understood to have used *Bacillus anthracis* and *Burkholderia mallei* mainly against the livestock and military personnel of their enemies. Again during the Cold War several countries were alleged to have widely used chemical and biological weapons.

# **Cyber Terrorism**

Cyber terrorism is an act of terrorism which uses the Internet to disrupt largescale computer networks using computer viruses and other means. The term 'cyber terrorism' is a relatively new entrant to the lexicon of terrorism. Put it simply, it is the convergence of terrorism and cyber space. It is an unlawful attack against computers, networks and the information stored therein to intimidate a state and its people. Thus, cyber terrorism is the most advanced means of terrorist strategy evolved parallel with the advancement in information and communication technologies.

These are a few consequences of cyber terrorism:

- Loss of integrity unauthorised changes made to the data or IT system can result in inaccuracy, fraud or erroneous decisions that bring the integrity of the system under suspicion.
- Loss of availability an attack on a mission-critical IT system makes it unavailable to the end users.
- Loss of confidentiality the consequences of unauthorised disclosure of information range from loss of public confidence to national security threats.
- Physical destruction the ability to create actual physical harm or destruction through the use of IT systems.

In 1998, Sri Lankan embassies were swamped with e-mail bombs by ethnic Tamil militants. This is believed to be the first cyber terror attack in the world. In 2001, Chinese and American groups engaged in a series of cyber attacks against each other.

### **Suicide Terrorism**

Since the attack on the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001, the world has come to terms with reports of "suicide bombers." A suicide attack is a violent attack in which the attacker would die; meanwhile he or she expects to kill others and cause great destruction. Their main intention apart from killing is to create fear in the minds of the public. The modern manifestation of this tactic is the attack on high value target. US Marine barracks in Beirut were attacked by a vehicle-borne suicide bomber in 1984 during the Lebanese Civil War.

The LTTE adopted this tactic successfully and in fact no other organisation comes even remotely close to the success rate of suicide attacks. Several highprofile deaths are associated with the suicide attacks of the LTTE. The assassination of Shri Rajiv Gandhi took place on 21 May 21 1991, which brought into focus the capability and ruthless brutality of the LTTE in suicide terrorism.

Jehadi terrorists took to suicide terrorism in the 1990s. The suicide attack by the Fedayeen has steadily been on the rise since then. The J&K Legislative Assembly attack in October 2001, the Indian Parliament attack in 2001 and the attack on the Akshardham Temple in Gujarat in 2002 are instances of fedayeen suicide attacks. The term 'fedayeen' means that the death of a suicide terrorist is not vital or is inevitable for the mission that he or she undertakes.

# **Effects of Terrorism**

*Terrorism destabilises governments, undermines civil society, jeopardises peace and security, and threatens economic and social developments.*

– Ms. Navi Pillay, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights

Terrorism is a major problem the world over, and it has the potential to deteriorate a country's economy and can cause disgust between two or more countries. It also has a lot of geo-political consequences, societal and psychological impacts. Some of the effects are listed below:

- 1. Damages caused to the life and property at the location of the attack.
- 2. A country's economy would push toward the recession stage as it will have an impact on the consumer's confidence.
- 3. Huge impact on the investor as businesses will go down.
- 4. There will be a drastic increase in spending in the defense sector.
- 5. Rise in ethno-centrism and xenophobia as a group experiences its solidarity in the face of violence.
- 6. Disruption in the livelihood of the people.
- 7. Post-traumatic stress disorder is a major psychological impact on the people.
- 8. Counter-terrorism legislation that infringes on individual freedom and personal privacy.
- 9. As a result of problem in peace and order, the potential revenue is lost for both the government and private organisations.
- 10. The tourism industry will suffer drastically.
- 11. Attacks may cause communal clashes among people.
- 12. It creates a sense of insecurity among the people.

# **Terrorism in India**

*Terrorism must be held to be wrong in every case.*

 *–* M. K. Gandhi India has been a victim of vicious terrorism since independence. The most prominent has been the terrorism in Kashmir, which intensified in the 1980s and is still simmering on. However, terrorism in India is not to be understood as being synonymous with insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir. Other than insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir, we are faced with Left Wing Extremism, ethno-nationalism in northeastern States and religious terrorism pan India. The Punjab military is a thing of the past.

![](_page_12_Figure_4.jpeg)

# **Forms of Terrorism in India**

### *Jammu and Kashmir insurgency*

The origin of insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir can be traced to the period after independence when Pakistan attacked India with a view to capture Jammu and Kashmir. Since then there has been a steady rise in terrorist attacks on the common people and security forces alike. In 1980s, there was large-scale infiltration across the border, and there was an increase in number of insurgent groups, which resulted in forcing innocent persons to flee from the state. In the 1990s security forces were deployed in large scale in the boundary areas and within the state.

The more recent rise of Islamist fundamentalism and emergence of Al-Qaeda and ISIS have reinvigorated insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir. However, they do not act as a direct threat. The real threat is from regional affiliates such as Laskar-e-Tayyaba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), HUM, HUJI and Al-Badr who share the same philosophy and outlook as that of their global giants, Al-Qaeda and Taliban, but have established distinct linkages capable of undertaking jihadi and terrorist activities on their own.

It may be mentioned here that JeM was formed by Masood Azhar, a former senior leader of Harkat-ul-Ansar who was released and handed over by India to the Talibans at Kandahar (Afghanistan) in exchange of the IC-814 hijacking hostages. JeM's declared objective is to unite Kashmir with Pakistan. JeM cadres are known to have been involved in several suicide attacks in Jammu and Kashmir including the one on the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly in October 2001, and they are also known for attacks in the parliament of India in December the same year.

There has been a dramatic change in the violence profile since 2006 with soft targets like tourists, minorities and migrants being targeted by terrorists, where the profile is increased by nearly 50% over the previous years in 2012–13. The threat from the terrorist groups may also be said to have increased with the formation of the United Jehad Council, an umbrella organisation of 14 militant groups led by the Hizbul Mujahideen along with the Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and the Jaish-e-Mohammed acquiring the most modern and sophisticated weapons and known support from international terrorist groups.

### *Burhan Wani Issue*

The mid months of 2016 were nothing short of a turbulent time in the Kashmir valley. The episode began with a video being uploaded onto YouTube, featuring a Hizbul Mujahideen militant by the name of Burhan Wani. In what was a rant against the Indian Army, the terrorist reportedly went on to seek the support of Kashmiris in his mission of liberating Kashmir. He was eventually killed in an encounter in July 2016 by the Indian Armed Forces, which led to widespread protests and rioting across the state.

Burhan Wani, the son of a village school headmaster, was a class X student, when he decided to become a militant. A bitter incident with the state police, in which his brother was hurt, is said to have pushed him to take up arms against the government. Within months of the incident, Wani joined Hizbul Mujahideen. His rise within the ranks of the terrorist group is touted to be legendary as he was soon recognised as one of the familiar faces of militancy in Kashmir. With his persuasive social-media skills, he is said to have recruited several militants into Hizbul Mujahideen, which resulted in the number of natives in the group going well above the number of non-native militants. Besides masterminding attacks on the armed forces, he consistently appealed to radicalised Kashmiri youth to fight against the government.

Further to his killing, the state witnessed widespread protests, which turned violent and caused severe harm to civilians. The protesters went out of control and had to be dealt with novel measures by the security forces. It was in this context that the forces opened fire with lead pellets, which caused a high degree of severe injuries and drew criticisms from all parts of the country. Though they were said to be non-lethal, pellet sprays on protestors resulted in several people losing their vision, either partially or completely, with no possible scope for recovery.

As much as it sparked off the controversy over the deployment of pellet guns, the killing of Burhan Wani led to further radicalisation of youth in Kashmir. Now more than ever, it has become highly important for the armed forces and the government to gain the trust of the people in order to send the message that they're committed to the mission of bringing development and restoring peace in the Kashmir valley.

### *Pellet Guns Controversy*

*Pellets: What Are They?* Usually deployed as a riot-control measure around the world, pellets are tiny pieces of lead shrapnel that are fired using specially designed pellet guns. Unlike conventional weapons, which fire bullets with a higher force and impact, these guns scatter hundreds of tiny spherical shots of lead with limited impact. These pellets cause immense pain on striking the human body and thus help in dispersing violent mobs.

*Are Pellets Non-lethal?* Owing to the limited impact caused when hitting a target, pellets are considered to be non-lethal. However, this holds good only when they're fired from a reasonable distance. If they hit soft tissues such as eyes or temples, they are likely to cause lethal injuries.

*Significance of Pellet Guns in India* Pellet guns were first introduced in 2010 in Jammu and Kashmir to deal with violent mob-like situations. Recently, during the Burhan Wani protests, pellet guns received a lot of attention in the media as their deployment led to lethal injuries for a lot of civilians. Some of them lost their vision either partially or completely, due to pellets being lodged in their eyes. Even in cases where pellets were surgically removed, vision wasn't restored fully.

# **2.16 Chapter 2 • Terrorism**

In order to avoid such controversies in future, the government constituted a panel of experts to suggest viable alternatives that are devoid of such hazards. In this respect, the panel proposed the use of non-lethal, chilli-based ammunition, called PAVA (pelargonic acid vanillylamide) as an alternative. The panel noted that PAVA would temporarily immobilise and paralyse a victim, which could help in bringing the situation under control, with minimal damage.

In February 2017 the CRPF issued a statement saying that they would continue using lead pellets, after raising concerns on the efficacy of PAVA as an alternative riot-control implement. While they stressed on retaining pellet guns as the major riot-control measure, they did mention that these guns would be modified in order to avoid the pellets striking the protesters' upper body.

# *Other Riot-Control Measures Used Across the World*

*Tear Gas* Formally known as lachrymators or lachrymatory agents, tear gas deployment is a commonly used method to disperse crowds. The gas causes irritation to the eye and generates a mild difficulty in breathing. It is deployed either in canisters via grenade launchers or through drone dispensers. Commonly, cyanocarbons such as CS (2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile) and CN (ω-chloroacetophenone) are used for the purpose. Similar methods include the use of smoke bombs and stun grenades. While smoke bombs are essentially fireworks that generate a lot of smoke, which impedes vision, stun grenades are non-lethal explosives that create a blinding flash with deafening noise that disorients protestors temporarily.

*Baton Rounds* These are non-lethal ammunition that can be shot using either conventional or specially designed riot-control firearms. They can cause considerable pain and, at times, even bruises and muscular spasms. Variants of baton rounds come in lead, rubber, plastic and wooden finishes. In order to avoid hitting sensitive body parts, officers are instructed to aim at extremities. However, these can kill a person besides causing severe injuries, when shot within a close range.

*Water Cannons* Water cannons are another commonly used method to deal with rioting and mass mobs. The volume, speed, odour and temperature of the water sprayed are different variables that riot-control units can work around to manage unruly crowds. In India, they were used in the aftermath of the destruction of Babri Masjid in 1992.

*Physical Barriers* At times, riot-control units use containment strategies to bring a crowd under control. Barricades, fences, bamboo shields etc. can be used for this purpose. These barriers help in either directing people towards or away from a particular direction. When done by field officers themselves, this can also help in trapping people at particular spots, so as to identify offenders or to enable mass arrests. However, due to its indiscriminately collective nature, at times even bystanders could be tagged as offenders.

*Wave Weapons* These are non-physical deterrents that can incapacitate people through electromagnetic and sonic waves. Commonly called as a heat-ray device, the active denial system emits a directed electromagnetic energy blast, which can penetrate the human skin and trigger a sense of burning even though there isn't any physical damage done. Another less technically sophisticated yet impactful device is the sonic cannon. It sends amplified sound waves that can create discomfort or severe pain, which make protestors run for cover.

*Ethno-nationalism in northeastern states* The history of the northeastern states of India is riddled with conflict and violence among the tribal groups within the same state, and also against neighbouring states. A large geographical area of this region was originally within the ambit of the state of Assam but ethno-nationalistic terrorism led to the formation of some of the present states through various stages of evolution during the post- Independence period. This topic has been dealt with in detail in chapter 4.

*Left-wing extremism* Left-wing extremism is based on the communist ideology of the establishment of a rural peasant class in the ruling position. It closely follows Mao Tse-tung's pathway in India. It started in Naxalbari village, West Bengal, in 1967 by an extremists' break-away faction of the CPM. This extremist faction was convinced that the conditions were ripe in India to commence its socalled agrarian revolution. After the initial outburst, groups occupied the vacant lands of Naxalbari village, which they considered as land holdings in excess to the permissible limit.

*Punjab militancy* The messy divorce of India and Pakistan had left the Punjab region of the erstwhile geographical region of Punjab in turmoil. Soon after the partition a journey for a separate Sikh identity emerged along with a demand for a separate state in India. Despite the formation of a separate state of Punjab, the issues of Chandigarh as the state capital, river water sharing and other issues kept the emotions high and always had the state on the edge. With the entry of terrorist elements, the situation worsened and culminated in the secessionist demand in the form of 'Khalistan'. This wave of terrorism came to an end and took along with it the life of former PM Indira Gandhi. Though terrorism came to an end, the issues pertaining to the conflicts and turbulence were very much alive. The Rajiv Gandhi–Longowal Accord in July 1985 was supposed to bring a lasting solution for the turbulence. However, with the assassination of Longowal

### **2.18 Chapter 2 • Terrorism**

the following month, the accord faced turbulence in implementation and violence erupted again. Finally, the conflict was resolved through various government policies of conciliation with different stakeholders. Still, there are isolated reverberations even today but they mainly spring from sections living abroad. This is an example of success of security forces, particularly of the police force of the state in stamping out terrorism from the soil. Punjab has been peaceful since then.

*Religious terrorism* There have been several terrorist attacks India which have been linked to religious fundamentalism. While previously all religious fundamentalism-related terrorist attacks were associated with Islamic fundamentalism, the last two decades witnessed terrorist attacks associated with Hindu fundamentalism, infamously called "saffron terror". Some of the religion activities overlap with political ambitions of separate Jammu and Kashmir and capturing electoral gains. Some of these attacks have even been supported and sponsored by external forces inimical to India.

While most of the terrorist attacks such as the Mumbai serial blasts of 1993, the Lajpat Nagar attacks of 1996, attacks on the parliament in 2001 and Akshardam in 2002, the Mumbai attacks of 2008, etc. are associated with Islamic Fundamentalism, the more recent burning alive of e Australian Christian missionary and his children in 1999, the Samjhauta Express bombings of 2007, the Ajmer Dargah attack of 2007, the Malegaon blasts of 2008 and the Mecca Masjid bombing of 2007 are being alleged to have been the acts of Hindu fundamentalists.

# **Anti-Terror Laws in India**

*The freedom of individual must take second place to the security of the State* 

– Lord Denning

Terrorism has badly affected India in many forms and the reasons may vary from religious cause and factors like poverty, unemployment and under-development, etc. In 1994, the Supreme Court of India observed that India was held in the firm grip of increasing terrorist violence and was caught between the fatal pangs of disruptive activities in the Kartar Singh case against the state of Punjab.

Anti-terrorism laws in India are filled with controversies as the arguments rise up stating that these laws affect the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III that are enshrined in the Constitution. There were many anti-terror laws created by the legislature in the past and were accepted by the judiciary with no hesitation and the motive was to enforce them properly until the situation got better. As the situation persisted and aggravated, these laws were reintroduced with indispensable changes.

Terrorism as an offence does not figure in the Indian Penal Code of 1860 or in the statute as amended from time to time. In India, the first special law which attempted to define terrorism was the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987, which was followed by the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002 (POTA). With the repeal of the latter in 2004, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, was amended to include the definition of a 'terrorist act'. The measures that are included in these are:

**The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967,** which was amended in 2008, defines a 'terrorist act' as –"*whosoever, does any act with intent to threaten or likely to threaten the unity, integrity, security or sovereignty of India or with intent to strike terror in the people or any section of the people in India or in any foreign country:*

- A) *By using bombs, dynamite or other explosive substances or inflammable substances or firearms or other lethal weapons or poisonous or noxious gases or other chemicals or by any other substances (whether biological radioactive, nuclear or otherwise) of a hazardous nature or by any other means of whatever nature to cause or likely to cause–*
  - (a) *Death of, or injuries to, any person or persons; or*
  - (b) *Loss of , or damage to, or destruction of property; or*
  - (c) *Disruption of any supplies or services essential to the life of the community in India or in any foreign country or*
  - (d) *Damage or destruction of any property in India or in a foreign country used or intended to be used for the defence of India or in connection with any other purposes of the government of India, any state government or any other agencies; or*
- B) *Overawes by means of criminal force or the show of criminal force or attempts to do so or causes death of any public functionary or attempts to cause death of any public functionary; or'*
- C) *Detains, kidnaps or abducts any person and threatens to kill or injure such persons or does any other act in order to compel the government of India, any state government of a foreign country or any other person to do or abstain from doing any act commits a terrorist act."*

The above act was enacted to deal with the terrorist activities that will prove to be hazardous to the territorial integrity of the nation. The sphere of the Act was sternly limited to meet the challenge regarding the territorial integrity of India and the Act was a self-contained code for declaring terrorist associations as unlawful, tribunal adjudication, prevention of funds and places of work of these unlawful associations, penalties for the members of these associations, etc. The Act is placed under the central list in the 7th Schedule of the Constitution.

### **Anti-Hijacking Act, 2016**

In an era when terrorism causes immense destruction to unsuspecting civilians, aviation safety becomes a vital concern for governments world over. With the Anti-Hijacking Act, 2016, the Indian government aims to provide a comprehensive solution to deter and deal with hijacking situations. With this law India has manifested its commitment to the Hague convention, 1971, and Beijing protocol, 2010, which deal with air safety.

# **Positive Aspects of the Act**

- This act expands the scope of defining the term 'hijacking'. Therefore, an activity that aids or encourages the hijacking of an aircraft will also be dealt with the same gravity.
- The law has a large horizon as it can be applied not only in India but also in certain international conditions (e.g., when a hijacked plane of international origin is carrying an Indian passenger).
- It provides for the confiscation of movable and immovable assets of the offenders.
- There will be a designated court to handle hijacking offences, which would hold trial on a day-to-day basis as far as possible to ensure speedy delivery of justice.
- Death penalty will be enforced even if ground staff is killed during the process of hijacking.

# **Areas for improvement**

- The act applies only to civilian aircrafts and does not include those used by enforcement agencies such as police, customs etc.
- The panic of hijacking begins with the receipt of information. Whether authentic or not, the information about a plane's hijacking can disrupt the normal process of working in an airport. It puts security agencies on red alert and requires the entire airport to be secured. Unfortunately the act falls short of dealing with perpetrators who make hoax calls.
- The act does not clearly define the terms 'hostage' and 'security personnel'.
- Also the act does not provide penalties regarding any collateral damage (even death of civilians) that could arise out of counter-hijacking operations conducted by security agencies.
- Moreover, there is no section on providing extra-territorial status for hostages, when an Indian plane lands in a foreign state.

Despite the shortcomings, the act goes a long way towards tightening aviation security against hijacking.

The **Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987** defines a terrorist as *"whoever with intent to overawe the Government as by law established or to strike terror in the people or any section of the people or to alienate any section of the people or to adversely affect the harmony amongst different sections of the people does any act or thing by using bombs, dynamite or other explosive substances or inflammable substances or lethal weapons or poisons or noxious gases or other chemicals or by any other substances (whether biological or otherwise) of a hazardous nature in such a manner as to cause, or as is likely to cause, death of, or injuries to, any person or persons or loss of, or damage to, or destruction of, property or disruption of any supplies or services essential to the life of the community, or detains any person and threatens to kill or injure such person in order to compel the Government or any other person to do or abstain from doing any act, commits a terrorist act."*

This Act is the second major act after the Unlawful Preventions Act, and this had more harsh provisions compared to the previous acts. The Act initially faced many challenges as critics argued that the Act was unconstitutional as it affected the basic human rights, but later the Act was validated by the apex court. The Act lapsed in 1995 as the enforcement official misused the harsh provisions of the Act.

According to the **Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002,** a terrorist is whoever

- (a) *"with intent to threaten the unity, integrity, security or sovereignty of India or to strike terror in the people or any section of the people does any act or thing by using bombs, dynamite or other explosive substances or inflammable substances or firearms or other lethal weapons or poisons or noxious gases or other chemicals or by any other substances (whether biological or otherwise) of a hazardous nature or by any other means whatsoever, in such a manner as to cause, or likely to cause, death of, or injuries to any person or persons or loss of, or damage to, or destruction of, property or disruption of any supplies or services essential to the life of the community or causes damage or destruction of any property or equipment used or intended to be used for the defense of India or in connection with any other purposes of the Government of India, any State Government or any of their agencies, or detains any person and threatens to kill or injure such person in order to compel the Government or any other person to do or abstain from doing any act;*
- (b) *is or continues to be a member of an association declared unlawful under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, or voluntarily does an act aiding or promoting in any manner the objects of such association and in either case is in possession of any unlicensed firearms, ammunition, explosive or other instrument or substance capable of causing mass destruction and commits any act resulting in loss of human life or grievous injury to any person or causes significant damage to any property, commits a terrorist act".*
- *Further, according to POTA, a Terrorist Act also includes the act of raising funds intended for the purpose of terrorism.*

With the increase in cross-border terrorism and the sustained hateful agenda of the ISI of Pakistan targeting at the destabilisation of India and the developments after 11th September, it became high priority to put in to place a stringent law dealing with activities of the terrorists. Hence, the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002, came into force.

The Act grants extraordinary powers to the investigating authorities, and the apex court upheld the constitutional validity of the POTA Act by stating that the parliament possesses powers to enact the law under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and the Act is the need of the hour in the case of people's union of Civil Liberties vs Union of India (2004).

Special safeguards were also provided to ensure that the powerful provisions in the Act are not misused and also to look in that the human right violation does not take place. Some of these provisions are:

Prior permission of the centre or the state government is always necessary to the cognisance of any offence to the court.

### **2.22 Chapter 2 • Terrorism**

No officer lower than the Deputy Superintendent of Police rank can investigate the offences. · Confession made by a person to police personnel not below the SP rank is acceptable as the evidence must be produced before a magistrate within 48 hours along with the statement of confession.

The misuse of power by any officer is punishable under the act, and compensation will be provided to the affected person.

### **Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002**

The controversial anti-terror law of India – Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) – came into being after strenuous debates and discussions. The unpopularity of the bill among the legislators can be understood by the fact that the bill was rejected by the upper house and had to be passed only through a joint sitting. Initially introducing it as an ordinance, the Ministry of Home Affairs offered several justifications for its promulgation. It came in at a time when terrorist attacks were gaining intensity and insurgent groups were building strong bases in different parts of the country.

Though now it has been repealed, POTA lives as an example showing the bold step taken by India in its fight against terrorism. Throughout its life and the days that followed its repeal, a few of its provisions were at the core of debates between political parties, media and social activists. The possibility of it being misused against minorities and political opponents was seen as the most obvious threat to a liberal democracy that is India. This fear was not ungrounded. The decade-long experience with the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention (TADA) Act gave legitimacy to the fear that misuse of such sensitive laws give raise to serious human-rights issues.

POTA provides for criminal liability for mere association or communication with suspected terrorists without the possession of criminal intent. Also it takes a legal presumption that if a person is found in unauthorised possession of arms in a notified area, he/she is automatically linked with terrorist activity. Additionally, pretrial detention for up to 6 months is another provision which can keep a person in custody with absolutely no reason being given for arrest.

It was repealed in 2004 after the government changed hands to a different political alliance. In order to fill the vacuum that had been created due to the repeal of the act, considerable amendments were brought to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. All terrorist organisations banned under POTA would continue to remain banned, under the Unlawful Activities Act, after the repeal of POTA.

### **Noted Terrorist Attacks in India**

Some of the most notorious terrorist/extremist activities carried out in the Indian soil are:

(*Countinued* )

### **2.24 Chapter 2 • Terrorism**

- 8. 2008 On 26th November, a Pakistan terrorist opened fire on foreigners, tourists and the general public in various places and killed 157 innocent people.
- 9. 2013 On 25th May, Naxals attacked Dharba Valley where 28 were killed and 32 were injured.

On 7th July, series of ten bombs erupted in and around the temple complex in Bodh Gaya, Bihar, and injuring five people.

- 10. 2014 On 23rd December, series of attacks by Militants in Assam led to death of 76 people.
- 11. 2015 On 4th June, a Military Convoy was ambushed by militants in Manipur resulting in death of 15 soldiers and serious injury of 15 others.

On 27th July, Militants dressed as army personnel opened fire on a bus and attacked a police station in Dina Nagar, Gurdaspur in Punjab, killing ten people including police officers and injuring 15 others.

12. 2016 On 2nd January, the Pathankot Air Force Base in Punjab was attacked by Militants resulting in death of seven officers.

> On 18th September, four heavily armed Militants attacked the Indian Security Forces in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir, resulting in death of 19 soldiers.

13. 2017 On 10 July 2017, the first Monday of the month of Shraavana, 8 Hindu civilian pilgrims on the way from Amarnath Temple in Kashmir valley were killed.

> On 24th April, deadly ambush was carried out on the security forces by the Naxals resulting in death of 26 CRPF personnel in Sukma district, Chhattisgarh.

- 14. 2018 On 13th March, nine CRPF personnel were killed and several others were injured in an ambush carried out by the Naxals in Sukma district, Chhattisgarh.
- 15. 2019 On 14 February 2019, a convoy of vehicles carrying security personnel on the Jammu Srinagar National Highway was attacked by a vehicle-borne suicide bomber at Lethpora (near Awantipora) in the Pulwama district, Jammu and Kashmir. The attack resulted in the deaths of 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel and the attacker. The responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Pakistan-based Islamist militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed.

### **PATHANKOT ATTACK, 2016**

The Pathankot airbase is one of the most important defence sites of India, considering its proximity to the India–Pakistan boundary, in Punjab. This airbase was to wake up to a shocking start to 2016, when it became the focal point of a terrorist attack by a group of 6 heavily armed people from across the border. The perpetrators are said to have made use of a tall tree near the perimeter fence and nylon ropes to sneak into the airbase. Along with them, they are said to have carried large stocks of ammunition and assault weapons. The tall elephant grass near the point of breach and malfunctioning floodlights were used by these militants to their advantage.

By deploying a strategy that combined stealth and surprise, the terrorists opened fire at security personnel. In the counter operation that went on for several hours to eliminate the band of militants, 7 officers including a Garud commando were killed.

In the wake of the attack, the national capital was put on high alert. Strategically important cities, ports and government buildings were put on high alert. Shoot-on-sight orders were issued to IAF bases of the Western Air Command, in the event of a terrorist attack.

It was later identified by Indian intelligence agencies that the militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad was the mastermind behind the attack, which aimed at destroying aircrafts and helicopters at the base. The attack drew strong condemnations from countries across the globe and put the ongoing diplomatic talks between India and Pakistan in a freeze.

The Pakistani government issued its condemnation of the attack and offered to cooperate with the Indian authorities to investigate the terrorist attack. This was promptly reciprocated by Indian officials, and the two teams began the investigation. However, the request by India's National Investigation Agency to visit Pakistan for investigation was turned down by the Pakistani government. This brought the investigation of the terror attack to a standstill and has resulted in straining the ties between India and Pakistan.

### **Uri Attack**

Following the Pathankot attack, yet another Indian defence establishment close to the border was attacked by a band of 4 militants. The Indian Army brigade headquarters at Uri became the epicentre of a grenade-and-gun battle between Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists and the Indian Armed Forces personnel.

It began before dawn on September 18 and went on till close to noon. The attack began with 17 grenades being lobbed within 3 minutes on an administrative base camp. It claimed the lives of 17 army personnel, and retaliatory fire ensued. All of the 4 militants were killed in the 6 hour long conflict, and nearly 30 soldiers were injured.

An analysis of the attack gave insights about the loopholes in security around defence bases in India. It was believed that the militants used tall grasses and bushes along the perimeter fences to sneak into the base, similar to the Pathankot attack months ago.

The attack became another incident, which led to the withdrawal of India from diplomatic efforts with Pakistan. India strongly condemned the attack and decided to skip the SAARC summit to be held in Islamabad in November 2016. As an aftermath, within 11 days, India launched a series of surgical strikes, which cleaned up terrorist launch pads along the line of control in Pakistan. Though the attack was denied by the government of Pakistan, the execution of surgical strikes became a landmark achievement for the Indian government.

# **Steps to Counter Terrorism**

The one-size-fits-all approach cannot be considered to be the best method to counter terrorism as every terrorist organisation has different motives and ideologies. Counter-terrorism policies have to be holistic and multi-pronged encompassing all systems – social, political, legal and economic. It has to be evolved in the overall context of national security strategy rather than viewing

### **2.26 Chapter 2 • Terrorism**

it narrowly as just terrorism. National security includes security of life and property of every citizen in the country, which is individualistic and also the common wealth of the nation, which belongs to all. While ensuring protection of life and property of all has dominated the discourses of national security, it has to be understood that a meaningful secure environment is possible and sustainable only when it factors in socio-economic development. In other words, the underlining cause of terrorism should be addressed.

To counter terrorism, socio-economic development should be made a priority so that vulnerable, deprived and disadvantaged sections of society do not fall prey to the false propaganda of terrorists. The administration should become sensitive to the needs and grievances of the citizens. Specially, the service delivery methods must be responsive to the long-awaiting grievances of the people so that these are looked into immediately and cannot be left to be exploited by terrorist organizations. To make this a reality, the Justice system and the Law Enforcement Agencies have to be supported with the required legal framework, ample training infrastructure, equipment and intelligence.

The holistic approach shall require the involvement of all the stakeholders – the government, political parties, security agencies, civil society and media. This strategy should bring together political, social, economic, administrative, police and other measures. The essential components of such a strategy are:

*Political will and consensus:* Often, we find that the tussle between the union and states, lack of synchronisation of counter-terrorist policies and mechanisms between them lead to slip ups in security. Political parties should have the will power to put aside differences and work for consensus realising that all parties are supposed to work for the people's welfare and that they all have to work towards the same cause. There should be a national plan within which the plans of the States and Union Territories are consolidated. All plans should be clearly demarcated and accountability has to be fixed to each entity. The Union should provide for necessary technical and tactical support to the States and Union Territories. The communication between the Union and the States/Union Territories must be two-way so that intelligence flow will be smooth. While bidding to build a national consensus on an issue of significant criticality such as countering terrorism, it has to be borne in mind that it is only plausible if the national as well as regional parties rise above their sectarian and petty electoral compulsions.

*Socio-economic development:* Poverty is one of the major causes and the breeding grounds for terrorism. It is often the deprived and alienated sections of the society who fall victims to the terrorist propaganda. The way out is to bring about overall socio-economic development. The growth in the economy should be inclusive so that the poor get their due share which would enable them to come out of the vicious circle of poverty and associated factors such as unemployment and underemployed that drive the youth to take up terror or disruptive activities.

*Good Governance:* Socio-economic development can be truly made possible only when policies are actually implemented in letter and spirit. A clean, corruption-free and accountable administration at all levels is imperative.

*Co-ordinated and specialised units:* Countering terrorism is not routine law enforcement; it is a specialised job which requires high levels of coordination and intelligence mechanism. The police forces are already overburdened with their routine work that it is not possible for them to expend the time and energy that counter terrorism demands. A specialised body of forces to deal exclusively with terrorism-related national security is the need of the hour. Further, they will have to work in tandem with the local terrorism police who will have the widest reach among the local public.

### **Surgical Strikes**

A surgical strike is an attack carried out by military forces by entering deep into hostile territory and executing assaults on legitimate targets with little or no collateral damage to surrounding areas. In September 2016 the Indian Army crossed the Line of Control (LOC) and proceeded deep into the Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK) territory and attacked multiple terrorist launch pads that were operating along the border. It was carried out by Indian Army Para Commandos. Each launch pad was estimated to have around 30 to 40 terrorists, and the army said that there were massive casualties of terrorists, guides and handlers.

### **Global Terror Database**

The Global Terror Database is a repository of nearly 11,000 terror suspects, featuring their nationality, photographs, fingerprints etc., maintained by the Terrorist Screening Centre (TSC) of the US government. It is a compendium of terrorist watch lists under the possession of different enforcement agencies in the United States.

In June 2016, the Indian Home Ministry signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to join the Global Terror Database in order to enhance the efforts in counterterrorism cooperation between India and the United States. With this MoU, India became a formal entrant into the US Homeland Security Presidential Directive-6 (HSPD-6). There are 30 other countries that have also signed similar agreements with the United States to cooperate in the sphere of counterterrorism.

Though the proposal had been doing the rounds since 2012, it couldn't see the light of day due to reservations of Indian intelligence agencies about the program. The Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) and the Intelligence Bureau (IB) didn't approve of the initially proposed unhindered access of India's terrorist database that would be given to the US government. But the statement issued by the Home Ministry said that the access of information will be subject to terms and conditions: 'Under this arrangement, both sides will give each other access to terrorism screening information through designated contact points, subject to domestic laws and regulations.'

# **Benefits of MoU**

- The agreement enables India to access biographic details of terrorists and terror suspects from around the globe.
- It will help India's counterterrorism initiatives in nabbing potential terrorists, their launch pads and sleeper cells.
- As India is now a formal entrant into the US HSPD-6, it opens the possibilities for joint operations against terrorist groups.

*Countering terrorism psychologically:* Terrorist activities are aimed at creating fear in the minds of the people. They feed on the fear of people in order to strengthen themselves. This psychological warfare has to be aptly countered by the government. The government should emphasise on civilian resistance to counter terrorism. Management of information services and the media, in conjunction with the intelligence wing of the police, can play an important role in achieving this objective.

*Providing the appropriate legal framework:* Terrorism is not just a crime against an individual or a society, but it is a crime against the sovereignty of the state. Normal laws like IPC apply to ordinary crimes, whereas it proves to be ineffective against extraordinary crimes like terrorism. To some extent we have appropriate specialised laws such as the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987, The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, and The Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002. However, they have to be strengthened to deal effectively with terror-related activities. But to prevent its misuse by the Police Machinery, we need to have a proper mechanism.

*Capacity building:* The capacity building should take place at all levels and among all the stakeholders. It should extend to all agencies involved in anti-terrorist activities, civil administration and the society included. Secular education, a strong legal system and ICT-enabled critical technology-based infrastructure should be used to effectively counter terrorism.

*Cutting down the finances:* Terrorist activities require substantial financial support. Apart from the proceeds of illegal operations such as drug trafficking, counterfeit currencies, smuggling, money laundering and ransom money such funding could be sourced even from the proceeds of lawful activities. People who support militant ideology contribute money from their own source of income and could also do it as contributions that are made to non-profit and charitable organizations, which act as a proxy to terrorist outfits. Strong laws, intelligence and transnational treaties have to be put in place to choke the terrorists. It's plain and simple – No funds No guns, No guns No Violence, No Violence No Threat. It's by blocking the financial sources that LTTE were finally defeated.

# **Role of Passive Stakeholders**

Citizens are passive stakeholders – the civil society, political parties, schools and colleges and media. Though we term them as being passive stakeholders, they indeed are capable of tipping the scales in favour of our war against the terrorists. A multi-dimensional response to combat terrorism would require wellcoordinated action on all fronts and each of these agencies/institutions has an important role to play.

# **Educational Institutions**

The genesis of violence in the society lies in the disharmony between various groups based on social, economic, political and ideological differences. This disharmony does not always erupt into violence, it rather lays dormant and gets accumulated. It reveals in situations of latent conflicts and escalates into violent outbreaks. Such outbreaks can be easily exploited by the anti-national elements and terrorism can be served on a platter. Schools and colleges play a significant role in bringing about lasting peace in the society. Education also has a role in creating a proper environment for peace. Through secular knowledge and wide exposure they dispel ignorance making the individual appreciate the diversity. They bring about a harmonious and cohesive society. Such an educated person is less likely to be influenced by a terrorist's ideology.

The National Focus Group on Education for Peace set up by the NCERT suggested that:

- i. schools are potential nurseries for peace since school education involves the formative years in a person's life during which children can be oriented to peace rather than towards violence;
- ii. teachers can be social healers by going beyond the academic syllabi to focus on pupil-centered education in order to inculcate human values in the students and
- iii. peace skills promote academic excellence because the capacity to listen, to co-operate with each other and to develop a positive attitude is the hallmark of a good student as well as that of a peace-oriented person.

NCERT has accordingly proposed a scheme to encourage and support institutions, voluntary agencies and NGOs. It is engaged with school education for the promotion of Education for Peace within the country. These initiatives need to be encouraged with necessary funds and other material support.

Religious educational institutions like *madrasas* and *gurukuls* could play a major role in bringing about peace. In fact, given the current levels of intolerance and communal hatred, one will be seldom surprised to hear that about a fundamentalist terrorist attack. In such circumstances it becomes imperative to have a holistic strategy for the promotion of Education for Peace, covering secular as well as religious schools. The feasibility of extending this scheme as suggested by the NCERT to religious schools should be considered.

### **Civil Society**

Civil society forms an important component of governance. It plays a supplementary and complementary role to the traditional governmental effort. There has been a significant increase in the participation of civil society groups in public affairs. They happen to become the last mile connectivity tool to the government. They have been playing an active role in bringing the grievances of the citizens to the notice of the government. They act as a mediator and negotiator of sorts between the government and the citizen. This proximity of the civil society groups to the masses has the potential to be used by the state in its fight against terrorism. They could be used for collecting information, educating the public thereby weaning them away from terrorist ideology in bringing about social inclusion and addressing socio-economic deprivation, which is the important cause of terrorism getting a stronghold.

Partnership can be established between law enforcement agencies, emergency response teams and civil societies and NGOs. All these agencies come up with programmes on spreading awareness and understanding the diversity of local cultures, religious customs and traditions of certain communities and act as arbitrators and conciliators in conflict resolution and easing tensions. An alert citizenry is perhaps the best way to ward off terrorist strikes. Civil society working in synchronism with the agencies of the State can help in developing this capability among the citizens.

### **Media**

Media is like a two-edged knife. The usage depends on the hand that holds it. In the hands of the terrorists, it spreads fear, panic and chaos among the public. If used effectively by the state it can be used to spread peace, hope and harmony. As the Fourth Estate, the media has always played a major role in public life. It not only reflects public sentiments but also creates public opinion. With the evolution of social networking, the coverage, extent and reach of media have become unlimited. Today the media exerts more influence on the minds of the people than any other point in time. Media reports can spread rumours, create havoc, instigate and spread violence, but they are also capable of bringing about peace with careful and ethical dissemination of information.

Terrorists too crave and thrive on publicity. The main objective of terrorists is to induce psychological fear in the minds of the public and the government alike. The media does not intend to promote the cause of terrorism, but the nature and mandated function of the media – to cover events, developments and issues – can be exploited by the terrorists. Thus, unintentionally, the media may serve the expectations of the terrorists. The media should understand that terrorists are exploiting them to further their causes and should address them adequately so that they unwittingly do not form a part of the nefarious schemes of the terrorists.

The media is a powerful tool but if the government ignores its potential, it can be a lethal combination in the fight against terrorism. The government should work towards harnessing the power of the mass media as a part of its strategy to defeat terrorism. The government should have a special Public Relations Team that would exclusively deal with the media in an attempt to use media to its advantage.

To use media as an effective tool against terrorism, the Administrative Reforms Commission has advocated for the need to have a media policy based on:

- a. Transparency in governance.
- b. Easy access to information and sources.
- c. Advancing the media's role as an instrument of vigilance to scrutinise and check administrative, legal and judicial violations and excesses that endanger civil and democratic rights in situations of conflict and terrorism.
- d. Engaging, enabling, encouraging and assisting the media to fulfill its role of informed, fair and balanced coverage of crisis, particularly terrorism.

Media sensitisation should form an important component of media governance. Publishers, editors and reporters need to be sensitised to avoid and exclude those elements of media coverage that may unwittingly advance the agenda of terrorists. Self-regulation of media should be encouraged.

# **Role of Social Media in Terrorism**

Terrorists are finding newer ways to carry out attacks across the world. Increasingly, they are using social media to recruit, radicalise and raise funds to carry out their terror operations. ISIS is one of the most adept practitioners of this approach. By recruiting highly skilled people, terrorist organisations are able to craft radical messages and conceal them through state-of-the-art encryption tools.

They make use of social-media sites to post videos on fundamentalism, beheadings and warnings to government agencies. Though the parent companies of these social-media platforms keep eliminating their user accounts, they keep registering with new identities and continue posting online. A good example is the case of Twitter suspending more than 1,000 accounts, which were suspected to be operated by terrorists or their sympathisers.

While it is proving to be a tough challenge to control the proliferation of such messages, intelligence agencies are able to track potential terrorists through social media. Using tailor-made algorithms, social-media accounts can be monitored effectively and can provide clues on the upcoming plans of such terror suspects. The bigger challenge, however, lies in educating the vulnerable population of youth to not fall prey to these fanatic outbursts and calls for martyrdom. If the youth can be trained about the advantages and disadvantages of social media, especially in the realm of terrorism and extremism, it can play a vital part in addressing the issues of global and regional terrorism.
