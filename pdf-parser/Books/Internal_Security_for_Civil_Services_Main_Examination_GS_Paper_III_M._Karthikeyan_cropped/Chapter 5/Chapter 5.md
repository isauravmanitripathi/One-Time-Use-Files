# **ThReaTs fRom exTeRnal sTaTe aCToRs**

External state actors are those organisations or institutions external to the home state, established and maintained by the foreign state(s) to threaten or influence the internal security of the home state.

China and Pakistan have remained to be the major external state actors having profound influence on the internal security condition of India. The influence of other states like Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Nepal cannot be overlooked when considering our internal security.

# **Threat from China**

Bilateral relationships between these countries have remained as that of conflict and cooperation. Border disputes with China can be traced back to nearly half a century from the present time with the major confrontation in 1962. But at the same time China has been the largest trading partner of India with a bilateral trade value of nearly US \$65.88 billion in 2013.

Looking at India's relationship with China we need to acknowledge the existence of both sides of the coin. China proves to be both an opportunity and a challenge to India.

#### **China not a Threat**

Considering the long-existing border dispute between India and China, it has to be noted that both the nations have largely respected the Line of Actual Control (LAC) between them though there is no clear joint demarcation on a map. Rare occasions of violations along the LAC have been largely contained by the agreed standard operating mechanism, confidence-building measures (CBMs) initiated by the nations, and status quo has been maintained. Commitment made by the nations through the 1993 border peace and tranquility agreement has been honored by both.

Incidents of rare violations along the border have often been sensationalised by the media despite the actual truth being shared by the army or ministry of defense. The governments of both the nations have always tried to maintain peace and tranquility along the border.

On the trade front China has overtaken US to be India's largest trading partner in 2008. China acts as a supplier of cheap goods for the Indian consumers. But these cheap goods of China pose a serious threat to the indigenous industries.

In the international arena too China and India have shared common interests and ideologies in areas like climate change, WTO negotiations, IMF reforms, etc. They cooperate with other like-minded nations through BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, South Africa) while dealing with the above issues.

A slew of initiatives have been taken by China and India along various lines like the establishment of the New Development Bank, Maritime silk route, Nalanda University, etc. To sum up India–China bilateral relationships should be focused on a more optimistic path with mutual adherence to peaceful measures to resolve the conflicts and increased cooperation in areas of common interest.

#### **China as a Threat**

China's growing geopolitical influence in the region is a major threat to India.

China has been keen on following an assertive policy in addressing the border concerns. This is evident from the May 2013 stand-off along the LAC in Ladakh and the intrusion of Chinese troops along the McMahon Line in Arunachal Pradesh. Their assertive territorial policy has remained as a major irritant in the peace initiatives aimed at resolving the border disputes inspite of the growing trade and economic relationships between the two countries.

Another major concern has been the Chinese government's initiative in increasing its military capability in the Tibet region and along the borders. This move aims at achieving a permanent military advantage over India. Though India has not yet achieved parity in military capabilities along the borders, it has been able to take an assertive stand at diplomatic levels for addressing the border issues where India's stand has always been that intrusions can never be tolerated and would evoke change in its strategic posture.

Other major areas of concern in the India–China bilateral relationship are the strategic engagement of China with Pakistan, the presence of Chinese troops in PoK, establishment of transportation and communication lines, control of Gwadhar port and free trade zone.

As a part of its major initiative to establish a Maritime Silk Route (MSR), China has been engaging with countries in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). The objective is to set up commercial and military facilities along its sea lines of communication (SLOC), which extends from the Chinese mainland to the Port of Sudan. This is seen as a part of its larger strategy to encircle India through its 'string of pearls'.

India, to counter these Chinese threats, should improve its military prowess and particularly its maritime assets if it has to improve its strategic posture in the South Asian Region.

# **China's Role in the Northeast**

The NER is a geopolitically sensitive zone to India, owing to its physiography and the narrow liaison with mainland India through the Siliguri corridor. Landlocked by four different countries, the insurgency situation within the NER can be addressed effectively through support from all the bordering countries. However, the situation on ground seems far from reality. Counter-insurgency operations over the last 2 years have resulted in the recovery of dozens of rifles, pistols, grenades and other ammunition, most likely made in China. Moreover, investigations by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) have revealed that the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-IM) and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) have been in touch with Norinco, which is one of the largest state-owned weapons manufacturers in China.

The weapons deals are said to be executed through a transnational network. Reports suggest that a money trail exists, which leads to Chinese bank branches in Africa. The insurgents pay the money to these branches and receive their shipments via Bangladesh and Myanmar. To aid the shipment process, ethnic insurgent groups in these countries such as Karen National Union (KNU), Kaichin Independence Army (KIA) and United Wa State Army (UWSA) come into the picture. These groups profit from illegal arms deals and are therefore critical to the survival of insurgent groups in NER.

At a time when India is looking forward to optimally reap the benefits of BIMSTEC and RCEP trade agreements, a stable security situation in the NER is vital. Therefore, it is imperative that India devises a two-pronged strategy of crackdown and diplomacy. For effective crackdown measures, it needs to amplify its intelligence operations, and through its diplomacy, it needs to push China into checking the prevalence of illegal trade of weapons from its own ordnance factories.

Unless these measures are effectively put to use, it will be virtually impossible to eliminate or mitigate the problem of insurgency.

#### **Threats from Pakistan**

India–Pakistan bilateral relationships have been difficult since the beginning mainly due to the difficult circumstances in which these nations were born. This has been aggravated by the ceasefire violations along the LOC (line of control)

The people in the disputed areas have been used in their operations by the Pakistan-sponsored terrorist groups. The withdrawal of the NATO and American forces from Afghan soil will only risk the increase in number of such attacks. The onus lies on India to assess the pattern of such attacks and devise an effective counter strategy.

Sub-national groups such as the ethnic/religious groups recruited by the Pakistan army within the country play a role in escalating these terror attacks to conflicts. This will lead to complete disruption of socio-cultural, political and economic foundations of our society.

These sub-groups function by religiously indoctrinating the vulnerable groups and subverting their loyalty. This polarisation of the society poses a grievous threat to the democracy and security of the nation in the long run.

# **Threats from External Non-State Actors**

Non-state actors, in the context of national security, are those organisations, which have sufficient social, political and economic power to influence the security of a nation. With globalisation and ease of connectivity, these non-state actors have transcended boundaries. Therefore, India's foreign policy and relations with other nations will have to factor in the threats posed by the NSAs. It has to be acknowledged that the non-state actors as we see today have emerged post the Cold War.

### **Terrorist Organisations**

India faces all types of terrorist threats – ethnic, religious and ideological. The foundation for the insurgent and terrorist activities in the valley was laid when Pakistan tried to capture Kashmir after independence. Secessionist groups have been attacking government institutions, symbols and officials. Innocent people have also fallen victim to these attacks and several have fled the region.

Apart from secessionist groups, Islamic fundamentalists have been involving in terrorist activities in the valley. Among them the Al Qaeda, the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and the Taliban pose the gravest threat. Even outside the valley major attacks have been staged by these fundamentalist groups including the 2001 attack on the Indian parliament, the 1993 Mumbai serial blast, 26/11 attack, etc. The Pakistan-based LeT has been operating networks in more than 18 countries including India, the US, France, the UK, Australia and Singapore.

Other emerging insurgent groups like HUM, HUJI, and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) have also been playing a major role in influencing the peace and stability of the nation. These and many other such organisations have been banned by the Government of India under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 2004.

The funds for these organisations flow from various pro-Islamist groups from around the world.

#### **Drug Cartels**

India's proximity to the two main drug-producing areas of the world – the golden triangle (Myanmar, Thailand, Laos) and the golden crescent (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran) – makes it more vulnerable to drug trafficking. India is being used as a major transit route and as a destination for drugs. So it is evident that the drug policies of other nations like Pakistan and Afghanistan also have an effect on India's attempt to curb this illegal trade.

These drug traffickers have established themselves as powerful syndicates and lobbies to control drug trafficking in India from Pakistan and Dubai. They have also succeeded in recruiting uniformed personnel in aiding drug trafficking. This has also had a serious effect on the security of the nation as they have established links with terrorist groups, thereby acting as funding mechanisms for various terrorist groups.

#### **5.6 Chapter 5 • Role of External State and Non-State Actors...**

Besides funding, the terrorist and insurgent groups that try to destabilise India have indirectly led to increased incidences of HIV infection in the border regions and northeastern parts of India. They have also been involved in moneylaundering activities affecting the economy of the country.

The Military, Paramilitary, State Police, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Revenue department, Enforcement directorate, Home Ministry and External Affairs Ministry have been coordinating to curb the menace of illegal drug trafficking. Further, India has been coordinating with various foreign intelligence and investigating agencies to fight drug trafficking. Also in 2012 a national policy on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substance was enacted to ensure greater cooperation and coordination at both central and state levels.

#### **Human-trafficking Cartels**

In India, human trafficking in major part involves abduction, buying and selling of women and children for prostitution, forced marriages and bonded labour. Poverty, illiteracy and unemployment are the major reasons that make people vulnerable to human trafficking. India has been both the source and destination of human trafficking. Women and children are trafficked from Nepal and Bangladesh to be sold inside the country for prostitution. India acts as a source of cheap labour to the Middle East and other European countries. They are employed as low-skilled labourers, domestic workers and sexual exploitation. There are also instances of Sri Lankan refugees from Tamil Nadu being trafficked to Australia.

According to a 2012 report of Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation, India has the largest number of child labourers (aged < 14 years). India needs to have a comprehensive approach to curb the menace of human trafficking and protect the vulnerable sections of the people including women and children.

#### **Fake Currency Rackets**

Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Thailand are the main sources of Indian fake currency. They are supported by ISI to fund the terrorists and undermine the financial security of the nation.

These currency notes are usually routed via UAE, Thailand, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh. Since the exchange ratio for these notes is in the ratio of 2:1, the revenue obtained is high. This is used in funding terrorist activities and obtaining the services of individuals at a lower cost to itself.

The Indian government has taken a slew of measures to counter the menace of fake currencies. A coordinating group has been formed under the Home Ministry to coordinate the information and activities between the state forces and central agencies. Further, a special cell to counter terror funding and fake currency has been formed under the National Investigating Agency.

For its part, the RBI has taken measures to improve the security features of the currency notes and increase the awareness of the people to identify fake currencies.

#### **Cyber Attacks**

Cyber attacks not only involve the attack by cyber criminals but also includes attacks by cyber terrorists and other foreign states. In case of cyber criminals their objective is primarily to gain monetary benefits.

However, in the case of cyber terrorism, the objective is furtherance of their political or social objectives. In such cases the Web sites of important security establishments are attacked and the Web sites or the network of information may be defaced or some vital information may be stolen or compromised.

India's abundant growth in the IT sector and its attachment with state departments make it extra vulnerable to such attacks.

#### **Maoists/Naxalites**

Although Maoists or Naxalites are internal non-state actors, they have strong supporting hands from foreign leftist organisations from Philippines, Turkey and China. These foreign elements provide them with enough logistics support to mount attacks on the government forces.

#### **Insurgents/Cross-Border Ethnic Groups**

India's international land border was drawn by the British during the time of independence. They were driven by geo-political, economic and strategic considerations while drawing the boundaries and not by social or ethnic considerations. So the ethnic groups were separated across nations along the borders. This makes it difficult to identify the foreign nationals. Moreover this has led to rising tensions during internal conflicts in neighbouring countries. For instance, the Nagas located in Myanmar support the insurgency activities of the Nagas inside the country.

Another aspect is the threat faced by the Indian diaspora in foreign nations and its influence on bilateral ties. For example, the Eelam Wars led to mass exodus of Tamil people from Sri Lanka to Tamil Nadu. This has caused strain in the India–Sri Lanka ties. Further, it has led to rising pro-LTTE emotions in the state of Tamil Nadu.

Also the threat from the Indian diaspora towards the security of the nation cannot be neglected. The financial and political support of the Indian diaspora to the separatists like Khalistan and those from Kashmir are also notable examples.

It also feared that the Indian workers in gulf countries are indoctrinated during their stay and used for terrorist activities and propaganda on their return to India. It should be observed that these groups have served as a recruiting ground for the Al Qaeda and other groups to carry out terrorist activities on their return to Indian soil.

#### **Illegal Immigrants**

Illegal immigrants are those people who migrate to India without any official documents for their stay. Of all, illegal immigrants from Bangladesh are the largest

## **5.8 Chapter 5 • Role of External State and Non-State Actors...**

followed by the Sikhs and Hindus from Pakistan. These illegal immigrants bring along with them ethnic troubles, insurgency, political instability and commercial problems. They increase the pressure on land, deplete the natural resources available, create unemployment for the local youth, law and order problems, rising crimes, increasing prostitution, etc.

# **Multi-National Corporations**

In this globalised world, multi-national corporations are increasingly influencing the global economy and relationships between nations. Along with their beneficial side in bringing investments to the country they also have a profound negative impact. They employ the locals for a very low wage compared to their global counterparts to reduce their economic burden. Further, they move their production units to such countries where cheap labour is available and ship the finished products. This severely affects the tax income of the government. They are also able to influence the policy decisions of the government and obtain tax concessions and subsidy benefits.

# **Civil Society Organisations/NGOs**

Increasing agitations from various NGOs and Civil Society Organisations on environmental concerns have put a pause to many hydroelectric and energy projects, and projects in the field of biotechnology and mining that are undertaken by the Government of India to fulfill its energy needs.

Although all these projects have environmental concerns, it is the responsibility of the government to go for developmental process and also provide the necessities to its citizen. Here, the most serious concern is that these organisations get funds from foreign countries to protest and other such things to stop the country's development. To counter these things, the government has brought in the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act in 2010 to have an overview of the money flow amongst the NGOs.

# **Pirates**

The other serious threat for the country's development is piracy in the vast seas. Pirates are one of the biggest concerns for a country like India because India's trade is highly dependent on sea routes. Anti-piracy ships are working around the waters to counter them. The International Maritime Bureau was established to report these pirate ships and their thefts. Compared to all the other sea waters, the Indian waters are quite safe, but the region of the Horn of Africa faces problems with pirates.

# **Anti-Piracy Operations by the Indian Navy**

In order to better respond to the menace of maritime piracy, the Indian Navy has been deploying its escort vessels in the Gulf of Aden on anti-piracy tasking since October 2008. These vessels escort merchant ships through the 490-nauticalmile-long Internationally Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC), and thus far 50 Indian warships have been deployed. As on 15 March 2015, the Indian Navy has safely escorted 3,075 merchant ships, and a total of 40 piracy attempts have been successfully thwarted by navy ships on patrol.
