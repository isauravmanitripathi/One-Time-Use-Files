#### **INtRODuCtION**

A border is a line that connects or divides two or more regions of similar characteristics. It is a strategic piece of land that has been well protected. India occupies a strategic position in South Asia and also dominates the Indian Ocean with its vast coastline. It shares the land boundary with seven countries. They are Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar.

Border protection is a crucial area in any nation's security policy. Having a very lengthy border, India confronts the unique problem in each of the border areas. India faces different problems from its neighbouring countries; for example, the cross-border terrorism, which is one amongst the Pakistan policies, is made in such a way that it would mislead the Indian people. The newest challenge that confronts India is the state-sponsored cross-border terrorism that destabilises the country. Border management must generally involve the co- ordinated action from various politico-administrative spectrums. Any mismanagement in border security will straight away affect the internal security of the nation.

**9.2 Chapter 9 • Security Challenges and Their Management in Border Areas**

#### **CHALLENGES IN INDIA'S BORDERS**

There is a difference in the ground situation in every Indian border. In the Line of Control and the Siachen Glacier, it is almost a war-like situation, a migration problem in the Indo-Bangla Border, relatively peaceful in the Chinese border except for some incursions and increased smuggling activities in the Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar borders. Few borders that have thick vegetation covers help insurgent groups to hide. India shares its coastal boundary with many countries and specially Sri Lanka, with which it shares the International Maritime Boundary Line. A few issues that started with the Katchatheevu islands, the capture and shooting of Indian fishermen and the seizure of boats at the international boundary line stir a few problems among the southern states.

A few border areas are physically unguarded because of their difficult terrains and due to toughness in approachability. Each border area has its own unique culture and religion that are completely different from the main country. The remoteness of the border areas helps in illegal migration, while smuggling activities are the few other challenges that pose as problems to national security.

The land borders and their problems have always received special attention from the government, but the term 'border security' has gone through a wider change in its perspective as the coastline and the airspace have also become vulnerable. Our airspace and coastline also require the government's attention as the land border.

The problems that have to be addressed carefully are illegal infiltration, smuggling of arms and explosives and the most serious is the insurgent groups that receive foreign support. It is the porous border that facilitates these activities more easily. So these activities make the government more vigilant and take steps to add power to border forces and their infrastructure. The reason for the continuous tension is the unsettled nature of our boundaries, specially the coastline, which is very difficult to be demarcated and many tiny boats are always moving out of their actual limits. Another problem in our borders is the multiplicity of forces in single areas, which has ended in improper command and control. There must be inter-operability of forces in these situations, which is essential for maintaining national security. Besides this entire factor, a few more threats around borders include:

- a rise in cross-border terror activities and non-state actors,
- impenetration of armed militants,
- illegal migrations and rise in left-wing extremism and illegal activities like the smuggling of arms, drugs, etc. and
- state-sponsored terror activities and also induction of duplicate currency notes.

Apart from all this, the most serious and persistent problem for border management agencies is trouble from local politicians, and sometimes local police force also aid the insurgents in their mischievous activities.

#### PROBLEMS FACED BY THE PEOPLE LIVING IN BORDER AREAS

Any problem in the border areas will directly or indirectly affect the people living in those areas. So this is the utmost concern for a border management agency. The people face problems like harsh living conditions, improbable access to government installations, inadequate social and economic infrastructure, very weak local administration, lack of access to government schemes and policies and the spreading of a feeling of alienation by the neighbouring countries. A few other problems that are faced by the local population are:

- vulnerability to the terror actions and aggression by the enemy forces,
- no freedom in movement due to restrictions by the forces by cross-border shelling and firing,
- lack of infrastructure, education, social progress and employment opportunities and
- improper reach of government schemes and policies and the government's neglect.

#### INDIA'S INTERNATIONAL BORDERS

#### **The Indo-Pakistan Border**

India shares one of the vast land boundaries with Pakistan. The boundary that divides India and Pakistan is the Radcliff Line, which can be split into three regions:

- 1. The Actual Ground Position Line (AGPL) across the Siachen Glacier, the world's highest war point.
- 2. The Line of Control (LoC) originally known as the Ceasefire Line, renamed as LoC, following the Simla Agreement, which extends from NJ 9842 to Sangam in J&K and
- 3. The International Boundary Line that runs from the LoC to the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat.

All these border areas are effectively guarded by the armed forces, where the Indian troops are deployed at Saltoro Ridge to block the entry of Pakistan forces in Siachen Glacier. The AGPL is still not properly demarcated. The battle of moral superiority is consistently fought between the armed forces of India and Pakistan. India guards the LoC with its army along with Border Security Force (BSF).

The LoC felt intensely tensed due to a proxy war by Pakistan in the last decade of the 20th century, and thus it assisted its militants in crossing the LoC borders. Consequentially, a fence was constructed across the border that went against the Simla Agreement, which mentions that there should not be any defensive structure near the LoC, and then the fence was constructed by both the sides very far away from the LoC. The army and the BSF both work together with good co-ordination with the local police and intelligence agencies. Each division in the border is guarded by one ministry each, in which we follow the principle of one border – one ministry, where the AGPL, guarded by the army is under the defence ministry and the LoC guarded by the BSF is under the Home Ministry's control. The Pakistan government has still refused to accept the International Border and uses it for infiltration and cross-border terrorism, and no Confidence Building Measure has still been taken.

#### *Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System*

With the task of securing the border along Pakistan, the Government of India has sanctioned a 5-layer security installation. This highly robust plan looks forward to effectively seal the 2,900 km border using sophisticated technology in order to prevent terrorist infiltrations and smuggling through the border.

The plan employs CCTV cameras, night-vision devices, surveillance radars, underground-monitoring sensors etc., to track the smallest of movements from the other side. These equipments are to be integrated seamlessly such that even in case of one of them failing, another will alert the control room. In areas where there are riverine and mountainous terrains, laser fencing is to be implemented to track infiltrations.

It is widely believed that CIBMS will be of great help in avoiding illegal entry, smuggling and terror attacks along the border. Though it costs Rs. 1 crore per km, the government has chosen to execute the plan. Moreover, it is also expected to help in spotting any person who aids illegal activities through the border from the Indian side. While attending a passing-out parade of the BSF assistant commandants, in Madhya Pradesh, the Union Home Minister mentioned that the entire exercise is expected to be completed by 2018.

#### **The Sino-Indian Border**

It is a very sensitive border that can any time trigger a very big aggression from both the countries. The border that extends from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh is the Sino-Indian Border, which is again split into:

- 1. The Line of Actual Control,
- 2. The Indian and Chinese perception of claim lines and
- 3. The International Border (IB).

The Line of Actual Control is again split into what India perceives it as and one what China perceives it as. The McMahon Line in the eastern part of India divides Arunachal Pradesh. The word 'perceives' here is for instance: in India's perception the McMahon Line divides Arunachal Pradesh from China and as per the Chinese's perception, Arunachal Pradesh belong to them. In the western border, the region that marks the border is the Aksai Chin Glacier. The Indo-Tibetan Border Police protects the Indo-China Border together with the Indian Army.

Owing to the lesser population in these disputed regions, the government was quite hesitant in developing the infrastructure and that has now become a major problem in deploying the forces. On the other side of the border, the Chinese government has developed very good infrastructure through which they are able to deploy force easily and in a very strong manner. Placing the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force in operational command has been a bone of contention with the Indian army, which has now become a serious issue. The process of bringing in the China Study Group to look into the resolutions has been a barrier as it has been the duty of the Ministry of External Affairs and the additional problem of Stapled Visa is another issue in this regard.

#### **The Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan Border**

Nepal borders India with almost five states, Uttarakand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Sikkim. As provided by the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the two countries, the citizens will have equal rights in all matters with regard to free movement and residence and also provides an open border. This enhances the bilateral relationships between these countries.

The Indo-Bhutan Border, shared by the four states, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Bhutan and West Bengal, is also an open boundary. The only concern

#### **9.6 Chapter 9 • Security Challenges and Their Management in Border Areas**

in this border is the insurgent groups, and this has been dealt now with the Operation All Clear. Sashastra Seema Bal is the responsible guarding agency in both Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan Borders. These two borders are highly porous and pave the way for insurgents and terrorists to easily hide. Better cooperation between these two countries is more than enough to resolve this problem.

#### **The Indo-Myanmar Border**

India and Myanmar share a boundary of over 1,500 km, of which almost 170 km is not properly demarcated and the overall the boundary is shared by northeastern states of India that includes Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram. The border is mountainous with dense forest and waterfalls, and being highly porous marks a distinctive region for all smuggling and terror activities. This border is protected by a group, Assam Rifles.

Both the countries share distinct historical, cultural and various other ties, and Myanmar is of strategic importance to India and bridges India with other southeastern nations; so it is of huge economic importance. Sittwe Port in Myanmar offers China another way of entry into the Arabian Sea. China's interest in Myanmar is also a threat to India. Tribes living on either side namely, the Nagas and Chin, share a family bonding. So the border must be left open and there also exist a 16 km free-trade zone.

The border is highly prone to narco-terrorism and hence is a part of Golden Triangle, and other problems include the smuggling of arms and infiltration. It is most important on the part of the government to look into the problem in a holistic manner.

#### **The Indo-Bangladesh Border**

Guarded by the BSF, the Indo-Bangladesh Border is the longest border shared with India. The border involves plains, forests and a majority of river segments. The either sides of the border are rich in agriculture. The Land Boundary Agreement proposed various methods of demarcation of the boundary in the disputed regions where the exchange of the enclaves in the subversive regions is agreed upon. All the enclaves were devoid of an administrative setup and all these issues have been taken into account and resolved with the Land Boundary Agreement that is accepted by the Parliament and implemented in June 2015.

The major challenge in this border is the illegal migration of people on both sides, which has now led to livelihood concerns, and also the people share an ethnic similarity, which has increased the problem of identification of the wrongdoers. This problem has been exacerbated by the local politicians who gather the immigrants for their votes. The smuggling of produce by border people is another concern and most important is that the camp is established by insurgent groups in Chittagong Hills.

#### *Border Haats*

Border Haats aim at promoting the well-being of people living in remote areas close to the borders of two countries, by establishing traditional markets of local produce that can be accessed by people from across the border.

At present, border haats have been established at the Indo-Bangladesh border in the states of Meghalaya and Tripura, and trade is permitted to be carried out in Indian Rupees/Bangladeshi Taka, besides barter exchange. The data of such trade is maintained by the Haat Management Committee of the respective border haat.

As per data furnished by the concerned state governments, cash trade equivalent to Rs. 16.86 crore was carried out at the said 4 border haats in the 5-year period ending 2015–16.

The 4 border haats are located at Kalaichar and Balat in Meghalaya and Srinagar and Kamalasagar in Tripura. In addition to the 4, the governments of India and Bangladesh have approved 6 more border haats – 2 in Tripura and 4 in Meghalaya.

#### **Border Management**

The Kargil War created a big alert on our vulnerable borders and stressed on the need to review our border security. National security needed a reformation in this regard and was pointed out by the review committee, and Border Management was recommended as the Godbole Report. With respect to recommendations in the report, the department of border management was created under the Home Ministry to deal with problems regarding the management of land and marine borders and also to deal with the infrastructure that are required during war time.

#### **Border Area Development Programme (BADP)**

Working under the Home Ministry, the department of Border Management has launched a programme called the Border Area Development Programme via the state governments; this was started during the seventh Five-year Plan. It originally started to cover the western border regions, and was later extended to all the border regions. The aim was to satisfy the needs of the people living in the border areas and also to make sure that they have the entire essential infrastructure. It is a strategy that involves the state government also to work in the border areas by sharing its planned funds with border infrastructure and also to improve the secured environment.

Under this programme, all the funds that are allocated to the state areas are fully non-lapsable, and a special grant has been put into place to cement all the gaps in infrastructure, education, health and other essential aspects and the need to induce the feel of security among the people in border remote areas.

#### **9.8 Chapter 9 • Security Challenges and Their Management in Border Areas**

The Government of India generally provides the guidelines and schemes in the programme with the consultation of all the local-level institutions. Initiatives like the model village, mobile dispensary facilities, infrastructure, power and tourism and sports are developed through this programme.

#### **Lacunae in India's Border Management**

There is still a lot of scope for improvement in the areas of border management in India. There have been many lacunae listed in the viewpoint of various analysts, a few of which are listed below:

- 1. India is the only nation in south Asia which still has not settled its boundary issues with its neighbours, has many issues and concerns with various ministries in the border management and has to complete drafting a National Security Policy. The draft of the National Security Policy framed by the national security advisor has still not been implemented, and issues have not been resolved though the border management comes under the Home Ministry.
- 2. The lack of accountability is another area of concern that is caused due to the multiplicity of forces in the same border areas. The lack of proper command and control is also because of the same reason. Inter-agency coordination is necessary.
- 3. Continuous withdrawal of paramilitary forces from the border areas for insurgent and internal security operations has also been responsible for the neglect of the borders. They have to be differentiated from the central police organisation when called to support the civil power in the way that they have to be strengthened in manpower and training.
- 4. Almost all the border management agencies are designed for countermeasures and not preventive measures; so they have to be trained for a pro-active approach. They are trained on the basis of reaction and retaliation, which has eventually led to problems in decision making.
- 5. Inter-agency co-ordination on the lines of sharing intelligence information and working in tandem at all levels is highly important. This is the most crucial problem that affects the whole structure.

#### **The Way Forward**

**1. Border Management Policy:** India needs to bring in a policy on border management that would give a framework on the overall response process and concerns in the areas of command and control. The very important thing that is to be considered is the peculiarities in each border, and a suitable strategy for that particular border is to be considered in the Border Management Policy. The direction for all the agencies must come from one nodal agency at the top during war times, which is the chain of command, and must be established.

- **2. Technology:** Considering threats such as the peculiarity in each border area, sensitivity of the local people and the topography, the use of technology is of great importance. The inclusion of various technologies, especially drones, must be included more in numbers in difficult areas, which would help in manpower-intensive border-guarding duties. The implementation of cutting-edge technology in border defence is the need of the hour.
- **3. Economic co-operation:** Border haats like the ones in the Bangladesh borders in Tripura and Meghalaya must be encouraged. The border trade has gained popularity among the local population to see their local produce. It has also generated employment to the local community, and similar haats must be opened across all borders.
- **4. Development of border infrastructure:** It's a very big concern and must develop at a very high speed and that would be possible only with clearances from all the departments. This has to happen in a fast track basis or the single window clearances. Areas especially along the Chinese region needs proper infrastructure. The border road network especially along the China border needs to be expedited in Ladakh, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim as the sanctioned roads are almost 5–8 years from completion.
- **5. Dealing with illegal immigrants:** As the problem of illegal immigrants is continuous and exists in all border areas, it is considered to be serious, and the registration of citizens and non-citizens must be given priority. The residence of the citizens should be maintained and updated frequently. Violation of Indian Passport Act must be considered a punishable offence.
- **6. Integrating local population in border management:** The involvement of the local people will make a positive impact on border management. It should be taken down to the base level, i.e. the village development council, for the coordination of local people in ensuring security prospects. Proper training and motivation to the local community would to be efficient in their cooperation, and the government could propose to have incentives for their involvement. They can report illegal activities and abnormal or subversive activities in border areas; they may also provide guides in hilly areas when required by the armed forces. The security forces must also ensure the help of the border people. Only then will the people also have a feeling of attachment with the agencies.
