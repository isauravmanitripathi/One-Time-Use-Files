# **NAxAliSm – THE gENESiS**

To understand the genesis of the Naxalite movement, one has to look at it through the lens of the Communist Movement in India, which culminated in one of the biggest security threats of our nation.

In 1925, the communist party of India was formed by the group of young patriots drawing their inspiration from the Great October Revolution with an aim to liberate India from the Capitalist and the Colonial Oppression.

*The Bolshevik revolution also known as the Great October Revolution of 1917 under Vladimir Lenin was an offshoot of the February revolution. A bloodless coup was orchestrated by the Bolsheviks against the interim government by capturing government properties and later they formed a government under Vladimir Lenin, who in turn became the dictator of the fi rst Marxist country in the globe.*

The biggest fillip to the communist movements was the Telangana Struggle. It marked a paradigm shift in the evolution of the Communist Movement. This

**3.1**

#### **3.2 Chapter 3 • Naxalism**

struggle helped the communist party in learning the experiences of Chinese revolution and also to develop a strategy for India's democratic revolution.

#### **Telangana Struggle**

The revolt started in 1946 in the Nalgonda district in Andhra Pradesh, which was then part of the princely state of Hyderabad, against the oppressive feudal lords and quickly spread to the Warangal and Bidar districts in around 4,000 villages. The revolt was also taken up by the local peasants and labourers against their landlords in their respective villages, which was also referred to as *samsthans*.

In 1928, the Andhra Maha Sabha was formed to bring about reforms in administration, demands for more schools, concessions for the landed and civil liberties.

The Second World War resulted in the spreading of communist ideology to Andhra Maha Sabha. In 1942, with the lifting of the ban on the Communist Party of India (CPI), the communists began to grow in Hyderabad. The Communist Party of India became very strong by 1943 and it had established a stronghold over Telangana, which led to the evolution of the Andhra Maha Sabha as a radical communist organisation.

These ideologies having spread across various districts amongst the peasants and small landholders conducted several struggles against their rich landlords opposing various actions like illegal taxations and forced eviction.

Visnuru Ramachandra Reddy, a landlord of Jangaon Taluk, Nalgonda, tried to forcibly seize the land of a lowly washerwoman, Ilamma, by sending goons. In July 1946, Doddi Komarayya led a march towards the landlord's house. The goons of the landlord fired shots and killed Doddi Komarayya on the spot and injured his elder brother Doddi Malaya and two others. The angry peasants charged towards the mansion of the landlord armed with hay to burn down the mansion. It was however thwarted by the intervention of Nizam's police. Thus, the Telangana Movement came into being as one of the largest armed peasant uprisings.

By the beginning of August, the Movement spread to hundreds of villages spread across three districts. Armed with sticks, slings and stones the *sanghams* organised and maintained local groups to protect the seized land and peasants from retaliation of the landlords. Several landlords abandoned their properties and fled the villages.

By the end of 1947, the communists organised village republics called *gram rajyams* with parallel administration across around 4,000 villages. A group of volunteers called *dalam* were organised and armed to fight against the *Razakars* (army of Nizam) and the police.

The entry of the Indian Army into the state of Hyderabad on 13th September 1948 under "police action" changed the course of the Telangana Movement. The untrained, unsophisticated and unorganised peasant army, dalams, were no match for the fifty thousand well-trained troops of the Indian Army. The dalams were decimated and were forced to retreat into the forests. By the end of 1950, only isolated guerilla groups existed. There was little coordination among gram rajyams, and the Movement weakened. By early 1951, the Nehru government made several conciliatory gestures towards the CPI, and after several rounds of negotiations, the CPI formally declared the struggle withdrawn on 21st October 1951.

#### **Post-Telangana Struggle**

The experience of the Telangana Movement gave birth to three factions within the Indian Communist Movement. The first faction led by Bhalchandra Trimbak Ranadive rejected the path of the Chinese Revolution, and advocated the path of democratic and the socialist revolutions based on urban working-class mobilisation. They were inspired by Joseph Stalin and viciously criticised Mao Tse Tung.

The second faction was led by Basava Punniah and P. Sundarayya of the Andhra Secretariat and leaned towards Mao Tse Tung's ideology and methodology. They were instrumental in taking forward the Telangana Struggle. This group while managed to taste success against the Nizam, withered against the challenge of the Government of India.

Soon after Independence the Nehru Government embarked upon the road to parliamentary democracy, bringing about land reforms like the 'Abolition of the Zamindari system'. A third faction led by Ajoy Ghosh and Shripad Amrit Dange and S.V. Ghate formed the centrist faction of the communists. They supported India during the Indo-China War of 1962. They differentiated between the Chinese and Indian conditions and followed the path of parliamentary democracy.

Partly the Indo-China War led to the split of the Communist Party of India into the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India(Marxist) in 1964. The split was more a rightist vs leftist split. The Indo-China War of 1962 created the flashpoint for the split. During the war a section of the CPI supported the Nehru Government against the Chinese aggression. The more radical wing of the CPI though opposed the Chinese aggression also opposed the CPI's support to the Nehru Government. They accused the supporters of Nehru Government as not being leftist and called themselves conservatives or revisionists. The radical wing formed the leftist faction and split from CPI and formed the CPI (M) led by P. Sundarayya, JyotiBasu, M.S. Namboodiripad and Harkishan Singh Surjeet.

The so-called leftist CPI (M) had in itself the seeds of Naxalism. Apparently, to some of the radical factions who had split from the CPI in 1964, the CPI (M) was not leftist enough. The CPI (M) formed the United Front Government in West Bengal as part of the United Front in 1967 and this was accused by the radical wing as betraying the communist cause and deviating from the stated objective of communism of an armed revolution. Charu Majumdar headed this radical faction that led to the Naxalbari Uprising in 1967 hoping to replicate the Communist Revolution in China.

#### **A Violent Dawn – Emergence of Naxalism**

It all started on 3rd March 1967 at a place called Naxalbari, in the Darjeeling district of West Bengal, which is 6 km from Nepal and 22 km from Bangladesh, covered with thick forests and having a tribal population of around 1,26,000.

#### **3.4 Chapter 3 • Naxalism**

*Naxalism derives its name from the name of a village in West Bengal called Naxalbari. They are the group of people who support the Maoist ideolog y and they were active in 10 states across India in 2009.*

On 2nd March 1967, a tribal youth named Bimal Kesan went to plough his land after obtaining a court order in his favour against the landlord, Iswar Tirkey, a member of Bangla Congress. The goons of Iswar Tirkey attacked him and prevented him from entering the land. Bimal Kesan approached Krishak Sabha, whose leader was Khanu Sanyal, who offered to help him get his land. The peasants occupied Iswar Tirkey's land, and he was forced to seek police action against them. Clashes followed between the police and the peasants, led by Charu Majumdar and Khanu Sanyal; the tribals and peasants started to forcefully recapture their lands.

Within two months, this Movement spread to West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. Thus, this extremist movement came to be called "Naxalism" and the perpetrators "Naxalites". The Naxalites claim to follow Mao Tse Tung's ideology and call themselves Communist Revolutionaries. They are also called "Red Terrorists" or "Left Wing Extremists".

#### **Charu Majumdar's Historic Eight Documents**

*Charu Majumdar wrote eight articles propagating Marx–Lenin–Mao ideologies. These are considered to be the Bible of the Naxalite Movement. The eight documents are:*

- 1. *Our tasks in the present situation.*
- 2. *Make the people's democratic revolution successful by fighting against revisionism.*
- 3. *What is the source of the spontaneous revolutionary outburst in India?*
- 4. *Carry on the struggle against modern revisionism.*
- 5. *What possibility the year 1965 is indicating?*
- 6. *The main task today is the struggle to build up the true revolutionary party through uncompromising struggle against revisionism.*
- 7. *Take this opportunity.*
- 8. *Carry forward the peasant struggle by fighting revisionism.*

# **Naxalism – an Evolution**

In 1967 the All India Coordination Committee of Revolutionaries was started within the Communist Party of India by the revolutionaries from many states to bring together all the revolutionaries under one umbrella. This committee called on the revolutionaries to start a Naxalbari type of struggle by propagating the Marxism–Leninism–Maoism line of thought.

Later the All India Coordination Committee of Revolutionaries was referred to as the All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries (AICCCR). They adopted two doctrines, namely,

- 1. Allegiance to militant struggle
- 2. Non-participation in elections

In May 1969 the AICCCR formed a new party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist). They elected Charu Majumdar as its general secretary. They indulged in armed violence in West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Bihar, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh with an agenda to annihilate class enemies.

Soon internal conflicts began to rise and the arrest of Charu Majumdar in July 1972 led to the disintegration of the CPI (ML). In the early 1980s, several Naxalite groups emerged in various regions. The Naxalites in Andhra Pradesh emerged as the CPI-ML (Peoples' War Group/PWG), and the Naxalites in Bihar called themselves the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC). The Peoples' War Group emerged as the dominant group with its active presence not only in Andhra Pradesh but also in Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra.

The two groups PWG and MCC carried on their activities individually with varying degrees of successes and failures. A period of lull was experienced in their activities in the 1990s largely due to strong police action. However, in September 2004 PWG and MCC came together and formed the Communist Party of India (Maoist). This has brought about a renewed spurt of violence that goes on to this day.

# **Causes for the Rise of Naxalism**

Any social and political movement generally comes out with an objective which is deeply embedded in the conditions of life of the people and reacts to their frustrations. These movements use development, participation and governance, which they want to be changed. The government plays a major role in being the sole authority in enacting legislations and functions as an arbitrator for resource allocation and shapes the relationship between the people and the political system. A few major factors that are the cause for rise in Naxalism are:

- The slow implementation of land reforms is one of the major factors responsible for the rise in Naxals.
- Mismanagement of forests by the government since the British era is one main reason.
- Lack of infrastructure in tribal areas has left the people with underdevelopment.
- Lack of employment opportunities because of improper industrialisation has made people highly vulnerable to join the Naxals.

#### **3.6 Chapter 3 • Naxalism**

- Social structure of the society is very poor as the people have no resources to meet their requirements, which is a cause for concern. People are socially excluded as the fruits of development do not reach them.
- Proper education is a problem as it has not provided the ability for the people to improve.
- Governance has remained inconsistent in most of the regions as popular schemes have taken a longer time to formulate and a much longer time to be implemented.
- Food insecurity is also a cause as the tribes starve to death in most of the regions, and they borrow money from lenders for more interest.

# **Initiatives by Individual States**

Naxalism originated in West Bengal but it has to spread to various other states where most of the tribes are concentrated and these regions are less developed. States in which Naxalism is seriously spread are Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Odisha. A few other states also include Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh.

Many among these state governments have taken a number of initiatives against the Naxalists. The initiatives are:

- To stop the Naxals from escaping the state border after an attack, the state governments of Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have decided to share information and to act against Naxals with co-operation.
- The State Industrial Security Force (SISF) is to be set up by the state of Jharkhand similar to the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) to protect and prevent the industries in the state from Naxal attacks, as the Naxals destroy machineries and the infrastructure.
- The Odisha government has to decide to deploy 10,000 extra CRPF personnel to counter the attacks of the Naxals.
- The Tamil Nadu government has started a 10-day guerilla warfare training to the state police in the central districts.
- Surveying of labourers from other states is being done by the Kerala government as the Naxals are looking for a hideout in safe places.

#### **Reason for Its Survival**

The illegal mining industry in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand acts as a source of finance for the Naxal leadership and cadres. This industry being illegal does not pay taxes to the government, rather they are paid to the Naxalites. It is also believed that this is the reason why Naxalites are hell bent on thwarting the auctioning and leasing of mines by the government to Corporate Private Entities.

Another reason for the Naxalism's strengthening is the inability of the state to bring about the upliftment of the deprived sections of society in the affected areas. Social indicators such as literacy, employment, etc. of the Naxal-affected areas are the worst, going way below the national average. Ironically, the tribals and lower caste people who are the India's poorest form the Naxals' cadre base. The inefficient implementation of welfare policies and corruption has led to further impoverishment of the already poorest sections.

Alienation of the forest land and their corresponding land rights to the tribals owing to large-scale displacement due to construction of dams and leasing out land for mining adds fodder to the already raging fire. The alienated people bear grudges against the state and this is exploited by the Naxals to their advantage. This rendered the Naxalites to make inroads into several areas and states.

*Ex-Prime Minister Mr. Manmohan Singh has declared the Naxalites as a serious threat to India's security as their number in 2006 grew to over 70,000 armed cadres. "Ultras" is the word used to refer Naxalites and various government militants.*

Another reason for its survival today is the lack of co-ordination between the Union and the States in their efforts of tackling Naxal violence. Law and order being a State subject and the Union's role limited to aiding the civil power of the State, there exists a conflict as to who is more powerful. This certainly adversely affects the anti-Naxal operations in almost all states.

Inadequate land reforms have been the major reason for the starting and also the continuance of the Naxal Movement in India. Land being the state subject, the Union had little to do with land reforms. The states on the other hand had made only half-hearted reforms at redistribution of land, which only helped in strengthening the Naxal cause. Very low industrialisation led to disguised employment in the agricultural sector. Lack of land reforms added fuel to the five, and many youths sought solace in the Naxal Movement either out of anger and frustration or for gain.

The Criminal Justice System in India is to slow to deliver swift and cheap justice. In contrast to this, the Naxals have been delivering justice quickly and cheaply to the poor through their *Sangams* and *Jan Adalats* (People's Court). This has created a situation where the people are looking forward to the Naxals for justice instead of the State. A sense of legitimacy has been granted to the Sangams and Jan Adalats by the people's participation which helped in the consolidation of power of the Naxals.

The Naxals rather than presenting the larger agenda of communism to the deprived and exploited sections of the people and seeking support took up local livelihood issues dealing with people's rights of *Jal*, *Jangal* and *Jamin* (water, forest and land). They became champions of the people's cause. This provides an emotional attachment for the people towards the cause and they readily provide support to the Naxal leaders. This local support provides intelligence, cadre base and logistics to the Naxalite Movement.

# **Strategy of the Naxals**

The Naxalites follow the strategy as propounded by Mao Tse Tung in his book *Yu Chi Chan* (Guerilla warfare) during the Chinese War against the Japanese. The Naxalites indulge in guerilla warfare against the Indian Forces just as China indulged against Japan. Mao in his book held that certain factors are critical for victory, viz. terrain, communications and technical support, local support to the cause, surprise attacks, cadre quality, base areas and relative military capability of the opposing side.

He also devised three stages for a Revolutionary Warfare. They are:

![](_page_7_Figure_4.jpeg)

The Naxalite cadres begin their work in remote hilly, tribal and rural areas. This will facilitate isolation and easy access to cadres as the governments usually ignore these areas. They work invisible to the eyes of the government. It is easy for them to indoctrinate the people and recruit them. Naxal cadres live and work among the locals and socialise with the locals. Gradually they gain their trust and slowly work their way into recruiting them into the Naxal Movement. This forms the early phase of Stage 1.

The second stage involves armed guerilla warfare. This kind of guerilla warfare is to have maximum impact on the morale, motivation and psychology of the Indian forces than gaining a territorial control like a conventional war. They are carefully planned and executed with precision. This warfare is of low intensity and usually the targets such as high-profile individuals like police chiefs, political leaders, community leaders, Panchayat leaders or from government establishments such as Panchayat offices, Police Stations, Jails and Prisons, District magistrate offices, etc. are specifically picked. Ambushing, kidnapping, robbery, dacoity and assassination are the means adopted by the Naxalites as part of the warfare.

The third stage involves military objectives and conventional warfare. Slowly arms and ammunitions are gathered by attacking and robbing police stations, arms depots, etc. Enough finances are mobilised and popular support is consolidated. Finally, a regular Army is established and combat operations are undertaken. Government forces are met in conventional battles to get territorial control. The end of Stage 3 will be the annihilation of the class enemies replacing the existing old order with a new order ruled by the working class.

There is no fixed and predictable timeline for the movement to move from stage to stage. Currently, the Naxal Movement is in Stage 2. Given the strength of the Indian Armed Forces and the nature of transition being brought by the welfare policies of the government, the Naxal Movement to move to Stage 3 might take ages or might never see the light of day.

# **Recruitment Process of the Naxals**

The ideology of Naxalists is to seek local support voluntarily. Initially Naxal recruitment too was based on voluntary basis only. However, as times passed they indulged in forcible recruitment out of desperation. It was no different from any other global terrorist organisations like the LTTE or Taliban or ISIS. They forcibly recruit youngsters, women and children. They had a policy of compulsory conscription of one member of the *adivasi* family for the Naxal cadre. If no male member was available, female members of the family were forced to join as cadres. This ugly face of Naxalism brought them in conflict with the tribals as they went against their customs. In 1992–93, once such conflict in Chhattisgarh ended with the Naxalites killing 70 adivasis. In an interview with Naxals at a Naxal relief camp in Chhattisgarh, it came to light that several cadres were below 16 years of age.

Though a large chunk of the cadres are tribals, dalits and peasants, the Naxals also recruit educated university students. These students by themselves indulge in rebellious activities. They engineer student movements and covert urban networks. They are the soft targets of Naxal recruitments. The strategy of recruitment also differs in accordance with the target group. When it is tribals or dalits and illiterates, they appeal through their local problems, which are mostly related to their rights of Jal, Jangal and Jamin, social, caste and class issues.

#### **3.10 Chapter 3 • Naxalism**

They hit the emotional cord or recruit by coercion. On the other hand, with respect to educated university students they adopt the policy of political indoctrination as a part of the recruitment strategy.

Another strategy adopted is giving incentive for being part of the cadre. The incentives may be financial support, food rations, goods or prominent position in the Naxal structure. Naxals also play the identity card to recruit cadres. They appeal to the ethnic, tribal, caste and religious identity of the masses to recruit cadres en masse.

As part of the recruitment, the Naxal recruiters perform a background check on every potential recruit before initiating the training process. Initially, the new recruit is admitted as a member of the party and is kept under observation for varying time periods depending on the background.

- 6 months working class, labour class or peasant class recruits.
- 1 year middle class, petty bourgeoisie, urban middle class recruits.
- 2 years urban intelligentsia and other recruits.

During this candidature period the new recruits are appointed under several units of the party. Various roles are allotted and the recruits are observed. After the candidature period, the party unit reviews the recruit's performance and then decides whether to give full membership or extend the recruit's candidature by another six months.

#### **Naxal Training and Structure**

The Naxalites were trained on the lines of professional armed forces due to which they have now evolved into an efficient guerilla force.

The arrest of Misir Besra by the CRPF from the jungles of Jharkhand in September 2007 has shed light on the training process of the Naxalites. He divulged that the Naxalites were trying to consolidate in states contiguous with a base area in the Dandakaranya forests on the Chhattisgarh–Orissa border and that they were planning to raise new ''companies'' and ''platoons'' to boost their strike capabilities in eastern India.

The duration of the Naxal training is estimated to be anywhere between 3 years and 6 years. Local youths are usually preferred for training and action in an area rather than outsiders. It is due to the assumption and is partly true that the locals will have an edge over outsiders, the terrain being their backyard. It is easy to train the locals and would be highly effective during guerilla operations in the local area.

Like a conventional army, the Naxal army is divided into squads, platoons, companies and battalions with strict discipline, unidirectional chain of command, rigid hierarchy and leadership. Each squad consisting of 9–10 men and 2–4 squads comprise a platoon. Each squad has a squad leader and an assistant. Each platoon, apart from having a platoon leader and an assistant also has a political propagandist who is tasked with political indoctrination of his platoon. Two to four platoons comprise a company and are under an area commander. Two to four companies comprise a battalion.

The cadres are trained in all modern weapons, which includes automatic rifles, self-loading rifles, sub-machine guns, Kalashnikovs, M-16s, gelatin sticks and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).

As devised in Mao's Stage 2 of revolutionary warfare, the source of weaponry for the Naxalites is mainly the Indian Armed Forces. They get all their equipments by attacking and looting police stations and arms depots.

They maintain two groups for every mission, viz. the core group and the Militia. The core group consists of full-time armed members of the Naxalites, while the militia are part timers who support the core group. The militias assemble only for the operation when called upon and after the completion of the operation disperse and go back to their regular life as commoners.

#### **Urban Naxalism**

Until recently Naxalism was associated with left-wing extremist groups that operate in jungles and treacherous terrains of rural areas. However, in 2013, the arrest of a suspected Naxal militant, working as a carpenter in Nagpur, came as a shock to police authorities. It was an eye-opener which helped them realise that Naxalite groups could also be gaining traction in urban areas.

These urban Naxals could be anybody. Usually they don the masks of writers, teachers, professors or film directors. They either act on their own or through an organisation made up of like-minded people. They make inroads into urban areas with the aim to recruit as many from the urban intelligentsia as possible to propagate their Maoist agenda. It is no surprise that their operations in urban locations are very limited. But they involve strategies that help them build a strong bastion of sympathisers and volunteers in towns and cities – the most common being the creation of front organisations. Front organisations may operate under the cloak of NGOs or social-work units, which raise questions about the use of force by government machinery. When a major module of the Kerala cadre of Naxals was busted in 2015, it was found that the group was led by a well-educated engineer who had written novels on themes of Naxalism. It was found that they were planning to enter Chennai to establish their network. During the course of investigation, it was also revealed that many intellectuals in the cities had supported their cause.

In March 2017, a court in Maharashtra convicted a professor of Delhi University under charges of spreading Maoist propaganda. It was said that the professor had been working closely with Naxals to create propaganda material for circulation among urban centres. When professors glorify about the importance of Naxals in eradicating poverty, they set a very dangerous precedent.

Through their active propaganda, front organisations romanticise Naxal attacks and raise funds, create safe houses for militants, provide legal assistance to arrested cadres and conduct mass agitations against government moves that curb the spread of Naxalism. While their rural comrades keep destabilising governance in villages, front organisations promote the cause of Naxalism among urban people.

#### Recent Naxal attacks:

- The paramilitary posses are in the forefront of attack by the Maoist militants, many of them were killed in typical ambushes. On 6th April 2010 Naxalites killed 76 security personnel, which was the worst attack ever. This attack was launched by about 1,000 Naxalites.
- On 11th March 2014, Naxalites in Chhattisgarh ambushed the security team and killed 15 police personnel, 11 of when were CRPF jawans.
- In 2013 Naxals attacked Congress workers in Dharba valley, Odisha killing nearly 30 people.
- In 2012, Alex Paul Menon, a collector in Sukma district, Chhattisgarh, was taken hostage for 13 days demanding the release of the convicted Naxals; he was later released.

# **The Government of India's Approach**

The government of India takes a holistic approach to deal with left-wing extremism (LWE) in a holistic manner, in the areas of security, development, ensuring rights and entitlements of local communities, improvement in governance and public perception management. In dealing with this decade-old problem, it has been felt appropriate, after various high-level deliberations and interactions with the state governments concerned, that an integrated approach aimed at the relatively more affected areas would deliver results.

With this in view, a detailed analysis of the spread and trends in respect of LWE violence has been made, and 106 districts in 9 states have been taken up for special attention with regard to planning, implementation and monitoring of various interventions. However, 'police' and 'public order' being state subjects, action on maintenance of law and order lies primarily in the domain of the state governments. The central government closely monitors the situation and supplements and coordinates their efforts in several ways. These include providing Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and Commando Battalions for Resolute Action (CoBRA); sanction of India Reserve (IR) battalions; setting up of Counter Insurgency and Anti-terrorism (CIAT) schools; modernisation and upgradation of the state police and their intelligence apparatus under the Scheme for Modernization of State Police Forces (MPF scheme); reimbursement of security-related expenditure under the Security Related Expenditure (SRE) Scheme; filling up critical infrastructure gaps under the Special Infrastructure Scheme (SIS) in LWE-affected states; providing helicopters for anti-Naxal operations; assistance in training of state police through the Ministry of Defence, the Central Police Organisations and the Bureau of Police Research and Development; sharing of intelligence; facilitating interstate coordination; assistance in community policing and civic action programmes etc. The underlying philosophy is to enhance the capacity of the state governments to tackle the Maoist menace in a concerted manner. The division also monitors the implementation of the Integrated Action Plan for LWE-affected districts (now called Additional Central Assistance to LWE-affected districts) and various other development and infrastructure initiatives of the government of India.

# **Government Response**

• **Anti-Naxal operations**

 Anti-Naxal operations involve the location, isolation and elimination of threat.

*Location* involves detecting the whereabouts of the Naxalites' base areas through intelligence and reconnaissance.

### **3.14 Chapter 3 • Naxalism**

 *Isolation* involves separation of the Naxalites from their support base which involves winning over, resettlement and migration of local masses.

*Elimination* involves several methods of neutralising the Naxal threat. This means depending on the situation and operational flexibility of the forces. If they are beat year an armed struggle, force must be met with force. Many armed men here have lost their lives in the fight against Maoist insurgents.

## • **Surrender policies**

 The States have brought out surrender policies for those Naxals who are willing to lay down their arms. The Jharkhand government has offered a sum of Rs 50,000 to Naxalites who surrender themselves with a monthly allowance of Rs 2,000 and also an acre of agricultural land, and other educational and health benefits to their children. Similarly, the Chhattisgarh government has also offered up to Rs 3 lakh to all those who surrender their weapons.

 The downside, however, has been that there is no mechanism to identify whether the so-called surrendered people are truly Naxal cadres. Also there have been cases where youths who surrender joined the Naxal Movement only to make the most of the sops offered by the government as a part of the surrender policies.

# • **Socio-economic measures**

 The government has brought out several policies for the upliftment of the Naxalite-affected areas so as to wean the youths away from taking arms. A few among the various schemes include the Backward Regions Grant Fund, MGNREGA, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, etc.

 The Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA) which recognises the right of self-governance of the tribals, has been implemented by the government as a measure to tackle the Naxal problem. The tribal areas of the Naxal-affected states come under its ambit.

 In 2009, an Integrated Action Plan was announced by the Government of India for its operations that deal with the Naxalite problems across the country.

# **Left Wing Extremism**

#### **About the Division**

The LWE division was created in 2006 under the Ministry of Home Affairs to effectively address the insurgency in a holistic manner. The division is responsible for the following roles and functions:

- Deployment of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) in LWE-affected states.
- Reimbursing security-related expenditure incurred by LWE-affected states under the Security Related Expenditure (SRE) scheme.

- Monitoring the progress in regard to assistance to state governments to upgrade their special forces under the Scheme for Special Infrastructure (SIS) in LWE-affected states.
- Providing assistance to state governments for construction/strengthening of fortified police stations under the Scheme for Construction/ Strengthening of 400 Fortified Police Stations in LWE-affected districts.
- Providing funds to the CAPFs for Civic Action Programme in LWEaffected areas.
- Reviewing the security situation in the LWE-affected states and issuing advisories and alerts to the state governments concerned.
- Providing assistance to state governments for creation of operational infrastructure and logistics required to combat LWE.
- Media and public perception management.
- Coordinating implementation of LWE-related schemes of other central ministries, including the Integrated Action Plan (now renamed as Additional Central Assistance) for 88 Districts and Road Requirement Plan for 34 Districts.
- Coordinating implementation of various development schemes, flagship programmes and distribution of titles under the Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, in LWE-affected states.

### **Review and Monitoring Mechanisms**

A number of review and monitoring mechanisms have been established by the government of India in this regard. They include the following.

- MHA is monitoring the situation on a regular basis at various levels. HM convened a meeting of the chief ministers of Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Odisha, Maharashtra and Jharkhand on 9 February 2015 to review the 3 worst affected districts of Sukma, Bijapur and Dantewada of Chhattisgarh. HM visited Chhattisgarh from 30 to 31 May 2015. Meetings are taken periodically by HS with state chief secretaries, DsGP and the Union Ministries/Departments, DIB, DGs of the CAPFs etc. on critical issues in order to get better operational results and to speed up the development process.
- A standing committee of chief ministers of the LWE-affected states under the chairmanship of the Union Home Minister to work out a coordinated policy and specific measures to deal with the LWE problem on the political, security and development fronts.
- Review Group (earlier called the Task Force) under the cabinet secretary to review coordinated efforts across a range of development and security measures.
- An empowered group of officers headed by the Member-Secretary Niti Aayog (formerly Planning Commission), with officers from Development

#### **3.16 Chapter 3 • Naxalism**

Ministries and the Planning Commission, to oversee effective implementation of development schemes in LWE-affected states.

• An empowered committee under AS (LWE) was constituted on 26 May 2015 to review the progress of various developmental schemes/projects, with the JS (LWE) and the JS of the concerned ministries.

# **Other Initiatives**

In order to holistically address the LWE problem, the government has formulated the National Policy and Action Plan, adopting a four-pronged strategy in the areas of security, development, ensuring rights and entitlement of local communities and management of public perception. The focus of the government is to address security, development and governance deficits in 106 LWE districts especially the 35 most affected LWE districts spread across 7 states.

Revival of Additional Central Assistance: This has been discontinued since financial year (FY) 2015–16; the issue of revival of IAP was taken up with Department of Expenditure (DoE) for LWE areas. A 3-year DPR-based programme is proposed for 35 most affected LWE districts. Budgetary funding will be given at the rate of ` 1,000 crore per year through special assistance under Demand No. 37. A one-time assistance of ` 1,000 crore for 35 most affected LWE districts has been decided by NITI Aayog (BE 2015–16 under Demand No. 37).

GIS Mapping: LWE division initiated a new proposal of GIS mapping of the essential services in the 35 most affected LWE districts. A project has been initiated for mapping of financial services, school, post offices, health facilities, mobile towers, PDS services, roads, security features etc. in a time-bound manner. This will help the stakeholder take informed decisions on developmental and security-related issues.

Mobile Towers: 175 additional mobile towers are proposed to be constructed in the next phase to increase mobile connectivity in the LWE areas. More than 932 mobile towers have been put on air from January 2015 to December 2015 in the first phase.

A unified command has been set up in the states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal. The unified command has officers from the security establishment, besides civilian officers representing the civil administration, and it will carry out carefully planned counter LWE measures.

Scheme of Fortified Police Stations: The ministry has sanctioned 400 police stations in 10 LWE-affected states at a unit cost of ` 2 crore under this scheme. A total of 282 of PSs have been completed; work at 118 PSs is under progress.

Civic Action Programme (CAP): This scheme was under implementation from 2010 to 11, in LWE-affected areas. Under this scheme, funds are provided to the CAPFs (CRPF, BSF, ITBP and SSB) at the rate of ` 3 lakh per company per year for conducting welfare activities in their deployment areas in LWEaffected states. This is a very successful scheme to bridge the gap between the security forces and the local populace and also helpful for winning the hearts and minds of the populace. In this context, funds of ` 17.65 crore and ` 19.02 crore were released to the CAPFs during the FY 2014–15 and 2015–16, respectively. For the FY 2016–17, an amount of ` 19.00 crore has been allocated as BE. The entire amount has been released to the CAPFs.

*In December 2011, it was reported by the Central Government that deaths caused by Naxalites had gone down to nearly 50% from the 2010 level, but this trend was offset by subsequent incidents of violence. In fact, the area of influence of LWE has extended to nearly 203 districts in 14 states. The number of armed guerillas have must sophisticated weapons, and have upgraded their tactics and field crafts. They raise funds to the tune of Rs 1,200 every year.*

# **Andhra Pradesh Model**

The most successful model of response to Naxalism has been the Andhra Pradesh Model. In the late 1990s, the Naxalite movements in the Northern Telangana districts were on the brink of moving to the strategic offensive phase of Stage 2. The Southern Telangana districts were in the preparatory phase of Stage 1 of establishing a guerilla zone. A similar situation existed in the Nallamala forest and the north coastal districts bordering Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Andhra Pradesh was on the verge of becoming an area of revolutionary warfare in India. Given the situation, the government was forced to launch a strong offensive action against the impending doom. It came in the form of Grey Hounds, an elite commando force raised to exclusively deal with the Naxal issue and put an end to it. It succeeded in curtailing the Naxal activity and almost all the leaders were either killed or arrested and whoever were left fled to other neighbouring states.

The Andhra Pradesh government suitably supported the Grey Hounds by using local vigilante groups against the attempts of the Naxalites to mobilise the locals. The Grey Hounds also effectively used the surrendered Naxals in weeding out the remaining Naxals. Effective policies with a sophisticated intelligence network helped the Grey Hounds, the local police and the central forces in launching co-ordinated efforts for the sustainable elimination of the Naxal threat.

The success of Andhra Pradesh has been not only due to the use of force in the form of Grey Hounds but also due to developmental schemes launched by the government such as Janma Bhoomi, Joint Forest Management, which enabled the people to exercise their right in the forests.
