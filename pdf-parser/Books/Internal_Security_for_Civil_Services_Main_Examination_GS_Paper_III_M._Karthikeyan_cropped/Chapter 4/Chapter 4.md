#### **Introduction**

The northeastern region of India generally comprises the following states:

- Arunachal Pradesh
- Assam
- Manipur
- Meghalaya
- Mizoram
- Nagaland
- Tripura
- Sikkim
- Some parts of north Bengal

The first seven states amongst these are collectively called The Seven Sisters, which is a sobriquet created by Jyoti Prasad Saikia, a journalist from Tripura. A narrow chicken neck of about 21–40 km, sandwiched between Bhutan and Bangladesh, called Siliguri Corridor, connects the Seven Sisters to central India. India shares its boundary in the northeast with China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. The language spoken by the people of this region is mostly of Tibeto-Burman origin. The northeast region with a predominant tribal population has great ethnic diversity and varied religion within this tribal population.

#### **Historical Background**

#### **Political Integration**

There were only three states at the time of independence covering the entire region. The three states were the princely states of Tripura and Manipur, and other regions came under the larger Assam province that was under the British rule. The other states got identification after a few initial struggles and were divided on the basis of linguistic and ethnic lines.

- Nagaland the state was created from Assam in 1963 in recognition of the Naga statehood movement.
- Manipur, Tripura and Meghalaya these states were created out of the state of Assam in 1972. Manipur and Tripura were formerly union territories, and Meghalaya was a fraction of Assam.
- Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh In 1972, they were initially formed as union territories from Assam and were granted statehood in 1987. The Mizo National Accord was signed to conclude the insurgency which paved way for the Mizoram state.
- Sikkim At the time of independence in 1947, Sikkim became a protectorate. Popular sentiment was heeded, and Sikkim was granted a full-fledged Indian statehood by the 36th Constitutional Amendment Act.

Arunachal Pradesh, known as the northeast frontier agency before independence, was separated from China by the McMahon Line. The Chinese stake their claim to this territory, and in 1963 this resulted in an unprovoked escalation of skirmish by the Chinese side which overran the entire region. Still the issue was not solved making the India–China border, a disputed territory.

As most of the states in the northeastern region remained independent during the British Raj their affinity towards an integrated India is still an issue. Although the northeastern states are now politically integrated to central India, the psychological integration to the idea of India is yet to be a reality due to the mindset of a section of the population.

#### **Geography**

**Climate:** the northeastern region predominantly has a humid sub-tropical climate with hot and humid summers, heavy monsoon and moderate winter. It generally has a pleasant climate with mild and heavy showers.

**Forests:** northeastern India with predominant rainforests has a variety of flora and fauna and has the last remaining rainforests in the Indian subcontinent. The region was described as seven most biodiverse regions of the world by Normay Myers (2000).

#### *Languages spoken:*

- Assam Assamese and Bengali
- Tripura Bengali
- Others Tibeto-Burman and Austro-Asiatic tribal languages

**Religion:** Hinduism, Christianity and several tribal religions. The minority is the Muslim population in Assam.

**Resources:** tea-based industries, petroleum and crude oil, silk, timber, forest resources and tribal handicrafts.

**Natural endowments**: evergreen forests, one-horned rhinoceros, elephants, other endangered species and several variety of endemic flora.

#### **Interdependence**

To bring in co-operation, and in order to sort the issues between these seven northeastern states, in 1971, the government of India created the northeastern council. The states were represented in the council by the Governor and the Chief Minister.

The interdependency of the northeastern states has increased as they are connected to the mainland only through a narrow corridor. There has to be mutual co-operation between them because for the movement of any raw materials or goods to the six states of northeastern India, it has to move through Assam as Assam connects all the other six states. Hence, Assam is considered to be the gateway of northeast and their co-operation is essential for the survival. Mutual co-operation is also needed in the proper management and use of the interstate rivers as river Brahmaputra flows from Arunachal Pradesh to Assam and other small rivers which originate in Nagaland, and Manipur flowing though the other

#### **4.4 Chapter 4 • North East India**

state boundaries. There are ethnic, religious, linguistic and tribal ties which extend these river border markings. Mutual co-operation and understanding is needed among the people of the same state as one can see diversity in all forms even within the state.

#### **Political Unrest**

#### **Insurgency in the Northeast**

A large number of ethnic groups are involved in insurgency in the northeast region with their own set of demands. Some call for a separate state, some ask for greater autonomy within the state and few others demand for complete independence. Most of the insurgent groups are armed and based on ethnic and linguistic lines as the region is home to diverse tribal population.

It is true that the northeast has been isolated since the British Raj. It is connected to India only through a narrow Siliguri corridor, which is completely surrounded by sovereign countries like Bangladesh, China, Myanmar and Bhutan. With only 3.8% of the population of India, it has a very small representation in the parliament, and all these have created a sense of alienation in the mindset of the northeast people.

Northeast has a variety of ethnic and linguistic groups who are now actively engaged in the self-preservation of their culture and tradition. Some of these struggles have turned violent with groups like the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA), National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) and NLFT involving in anti-state activities. After the Sino-Indian war in 1963 and the rise of violent insurgent groups, the security components on the policy matters concerning northeast have increased.

Growth and development are difficult to reach the northeastern region because of its isolation from the mainland India. Earlier policy makers were unconvinced about the northeast enjoying the fruits of development in the rest of India. But in the globalised environment, which creates boundaryless states, global villages, growth and development are bound to reach this region. As the northeast region is surrounded by many independent countries, it could act as the gateway to the southeast Asian market, and India could economically integrate the northeast to the south Asian market. This will bring in economic growth which will in turn bring in employment opportunities to the youth in productive occupation and will derive various other benefits to these people.

As per the 'Look east' policy of the government of India, the northeast region will act as the nodal point, and as a gateway to the East Asian and Southeast Asian region. With India's active participation in international organisations like ASEAN, BIMSTEC, Mekong–Ganga cooperation, etc. the northeast region has become an integral part both to the economic and security policy of the country.

Internal tension exists between centre and state, between two or more states, and also between various tribal communities within the state. The tension also arises due to settling of the illegal migrants from Bangladesh into India. The people in the northeast blame the Indian government for not taking adequate steps to address their concerns and stake claim for more autonomy and greater participation in the governance process. A few examples of internal tensions are the interstate disputes between Manipur and Nagaland because of the demand of Independent nation by Nagas, which includes the territories of Manipur and other states. The insurgent groups in other northeastern states like Assam, Mizoram and Tripura demand independent status or greater regional autonomy.

At present, these tensions have considerably eased due to continuous efforts of both centre and the state governments. Insurgency in Mizoram was completely subsided; the Indian government has made a number of ceasefire agreements with various insurgent groups and recently signed a historical accord with Nationalist Socialist Council Nagaland – NSCN (IM) to end the Naga insurgency. But still insurgency does continue to thrive in various pockets of the state.

#### **Assam**

#### **History**

The origin of the word Assam has been traced back to the Shan invaders of the 13th century. The Shan invaders were also called Ahoms, which is believed to be a derivative of the word Acham, which means undefeated or conquerors. The land of the Ahoms thus came to be called Asama, which is the Sanskritised form of Acham. Asama in Sanskrit means peerless or unparalleled. Assam is nothing but the anglicised form of Asama. The varied races of Austric, Mongolian, Dravidian and Aryan origin, who invaded this land, have contributed to its composite culture. Thus, Assam has a rich and varied legacy of culture and civilsation.

Assam was initially inhabited by the Kiratas, the Cinas and some primitive tribes collectively referred to as the Asuras. Kirata in the present context comprises several races that exhibit Mongoloid features. The evidence of Indo-Chinese invasions can be assumed by the various people in the region speaking Tibeto-Burman languages. The Bodo tribe forms the most important group of this race. They faced the assault of both the Ahoms and the Aryans and finally in the 13th century, the Ahoms established their control over Assam finally embossing their name to the territory. Then the Ahoms were defeated by the Burmese who entered through the eastern borders. In 1826 Assam became a British protectorate by the Yandabo treaty between Burma and Britain.

#### **Location**

Assam is the sentry to northeast India and serves as a gateway to enter the northeastern states. The state forms India's boundary with Bangladesh and Bhutan.

#### **History**

ULFA, in 1979, was formed at the backdrop of the All Assam Student Organisation's agitation against all foreigners. The important leaders, who were instrumental in the creation of ULFA, are Arabinda Rajkhowa, Pradip Gogoi, Paresh Baruah, Anup Chetia and Bhadreshwar Gohain with an aim to create a socialist and independent Assam through armed struggle.

It established relationships with groups like the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) of Burma and NSCN of Nagaland to acquire arms and training for the new recruits. It raises fund by forcefully extorting it from the people. ULFA has been banned by the government of India under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act of 1967 as a terrorist organsation.

ULFA's aggression increased after the 1990s and since then it has targeted security personnel, political opponents and the state's infrastructure.

#### **ULFA**

The ULFA is a separatist group whose stated objective is to create independent Assam through armed struggle. The government of India has notified it as a terrorist organisation and banned the organisation since 1990. Rang Ghar, a historic site related with the Ahom kingdom is identified as the place where ULFA originated in the year 1979. It seeks to bring back the glorious times of the Ahom kingdom and hence seeking an independent Assam. ULFA strengthened its position by establishing links with the NSCN and the KIA in the 1980s. It carried out many violent activities during the 1990s and hence military action has been taken against this group, which continues even today. In the last two decades nearly 10,000 rebels, army personnel and civilians were killed in these clashes. In 2009, India was successful in getting the chairman of ULFA into custody.

Apart from India, Bangladesh is also cracking down on the rebels, which has aided India's efforts to bring peace to the region. At present ULFA has diluted its stand for seeking independence, and has come forward to engage in diplomatic talks with the government of India. The Union Government, the State Government of Assam and the ULFA signed a tripartite agreement for Suspension of Operation (SOP).

#### **ULFA's Claim**

ULFA claims that Assam was never an integral part of India as the treaty of Yandaboo was signed between two occupying powers as Burma and Britain and the people of Assam were never involved.

It claims that its objective is to free Assam from the economic abuse and violence of India and establish an independent sovereign nation through armed struggle. It claims that the lack of national identity is the most basic problem of the people of Assam. It claims to accommodate all the people of Assam who want an independent nation regardless of religion, race, caste and tribe.

#### **The Government's Stand**

The government of India has banned ULFA under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. A number of strategic operations have been carried out against ULFA by the Indian Army, which is still continuing its presence in Assam.

The ULFA has carried out many assassinations and bomb attacks of which the most notorious had been the assassination of Surendra Paul, the brother of businessman Swaraj Paul, which lead to the dismissal of the Assam government under Prafulla Kumar Mohanthi.

The ULFA has been accused of having links with ISI of Pakistan and DGFI of Bangladesh. Apart from these, it seems to seek shelter from China as crackdown has been heavy in both Myanmar and Bangladesh, its traditional hideouts.

#### **Negotiations**

ULFA has put up three preconditions for the peace talks. They are

- 1. Talks should be held in a third country.
- 2. The talks should be held under the supervision of the United Nations.

#### **4.8 Chapter 4 • North East India**

3. The sovereignty of Assam should be included in the agenda of talks.

ULFA gave up the first two preconditions for the talks in 2004. The government of India refused the third precondition of Assam's sovereignty as a part of the talk. ULFA in 2005 created a "People's consultative group" which is an 11-member civilian group to negotiate on its behalf with the government of India; this was welcomed by the government, and talks were carried out. The group was headed by noted writer Indira Goswami, and these talks led to a temporary truce in 2006.

The following are the four contentious issues in the talks:

- Economic under-development in Assam
- Illegal immigrants from Bangladesh
- Equitable sharing of revenue from Assam's important resource tea and oil
- Massive unemployment

The success of the talks involves in making the ULFA leaders take up responsible positions in the society, either in the government or in civil society. Armed cadres of the ULFA need proper rehabilitation.

#### **Present Situation**

The ULFA, the centre and the state government signed a tripartite agreement for the suspension of operations (SOP) of ULFA in 2011.

However, their commitment towards peace will ensure the success of the agreement. It should involve the representatives of the local community, informed civil society members along with the government representatives to bring in diversity and voice from the grassroot level. Such groups when involved can successfully prevent, manage and end the conflict. Moreover such action will get the support of the people, and hence increase the sustainability of the outcome.

Bipartite talks are important instruments in bringing together the parties to obtaining peace. The government needs to counter the ideology of ULFA as it enjoys the support of the people. Civil society in Assam is pushing the government to conduct talks with the group so that the armed insurgency in the state is brought to an end. Moreover the constitutional setup in India helps such groups to enter the democratic process after giving up their armed struggle. The best example is the Mizo National Front, which ended its insurgency and got absorbed into the democratic process and the national main stream.

At present ULFA is divided into two factions:

- 1. ULFA-PTF: ULFA Pro Talk Faction led by Arabinda Rajkhowa.
- 2. ULFA-ATF: ULFA Anti Talk Faction led by Paresh Baruah.

The ULFA-PTF is engaged in peace talks with the government and has signed the suspension of operations. The second anti-talk faction renamed itself as ULFA-Independent (ULFA-I) and is continuing the activities of the previous united ULFA. It has established links with other insurgency groups and is actively supported by ISI of Pakistan. This faction continues with its violent activities today. The Union Home Minister stated in 2015 that Mizoram, Tripura, a large part of Assam, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh are almost free of insurgency.

#### **NDFB**

National Democratic Front of Bodoland, also called Bodo security force is a terrorist organisation working from Assam, which seeks to create a sovereign Bodoland territory for the Bodo people. Ranjan Daimary is the founder of NDFB who was arrested and detained by the government. NDFB though claim to represent the Bodo people, in reality represent the Christian minority and not the indigenous Bodos. NDFB was established as the Bodo Security Force in 1986 and later rechristened as NDFB in 1994.

The aim of NDFB is to create a sovereign Bodo territory in the area that lies north of the Brahmaputra river. Along with the NSCN (IM), NDFB has training camps in the south Bhutan region. The Indian army with the help of Bhutan has launched many operations to destroy these camps. The main objectives of NDFB as listed in its own constitution, which was adopted in 1998, are:

- India's occupation and expansionism should be removed from the Bodo territory.
- Colonialists who dominate, oppress and exploit the Bodo people should be removed.
- To uphold the integrity of the sovereign Bodoland territory.
- To set up a democratic socialistic society that promotes the ideas of liberty, equality and fraternity.
- To use Roman script in the language.
- To participate either indirectly or directly in the elections to the Lok Sabha.

#### **Ceasefire**

NDFB unilaterally announced ceasefire in 2004, where the Indian government paying no heed to it launched operations against the group. Later in 2005, a ceasefire agreement was signed between NDFB and the government of India. Both the sides agreed to stop the aggression against each other. The agreement prevented NDFB from assisting other rebel groups and also disarming members and were made to live under army supervision for a year. The ceasefire agreement is extended periodically and the peace talks have still not begun between NDFB and the government.

#### **Arunachal Pradesh**

#### **History**

Arunachal Pradesh was earlier known as the North-East Frontier Agency under British India. Only in 1972, upon conferring the union territory status, was it christened Arunachal Pradesh. It attained statehood status in 1987 and was divided into 19 districts with Itanagar as its capital.

It is the northeastern-most state and forms the farthest frontier with China. Itanagar in Papum Pare district is the capital of the state. Arunachal Pradesh is referred to as Prabhu mountains in the *Kalika Purana and Mahabharata.*

#### **The McMahon Line**

In 1914, the Shimla Accord was signed between China, British India and Tibet. The objective of the Shimla Accord was to define a boundary line between the inner and outer Tibet and between outer Tibet and British India. Sir Henry McMahon drew a boundary line between outer Tibet and British India and hence the name. The Tibetan and British representatives agreed to this boundary that ceded Tawang to British India which is a boundary line between outer Tibet and British Raj, while Chinese representatives also agreed to it. The Chinese representatives disagreed on the boundary agreement of inner and outer Tibet. But Tibet and Britain went ahead and agreed upon the accord, and the Chinese representatives stated that Tibet was not independent and any such accord without Chinese assent was invalid.

Only after two decades in 1938, the British government published maps showing Tawang to be part of the North-East Frontier Agency. In late 1947, Tibet retracted its position and claimed territory to the south of the agreed boundary.

In 1950 India unilaterally declared the McMahon Line to be the boundary in the NEFA sector and vacated the rest of the Tibetan administration from Tawang. People's Republic of China never accepted the boundary and claims Tawang to be a part of Tibet on behalf of the Tibetans.

This created a war-like situation in 1962, when People's Republic of China overran NEFA. Most of the areas in Arunachal Pradesh were captured, and China declared itself victorious and voluntarily withdrew back to the McMahon Line. Thus, the border is still a disputed area between China and India, and the people of Arunachal are being issued stapled visas by the Chinese.

#### **Insurgency**

The Arunachal Dragon Force was the only isolated incidence of insurgent movement in Arunachal Pradesh, which arose in 2001 as the East India Liberation Front (EALF). Indigenous insurgent movements in Arunachal Pradesh are insignificant and have a very small support base. Most of the violent activities in Arunachal Pradesh are caused by groups that belong to and operate from other states. For example, insurgent groups like NSCN (IM) and NSCN (K) groups, which have their base in Nagaland, train their cadres in the districts of Changlang, Tirap, which is in the southwestern part of Arunachal Pradesh. Moreover, this region has faced the turf wars between the two factions of the Naga insurgency movement, NSCN-IM and NSCN-K.

#### **4.12 Chapter 4 • North East India**

Few other groups that operate from Assam and Manipur use the territory to traffic arms and ammunitions from neighbouring countries especially Myanmar. Bodo insurgents from Assam have used Arunachal as their safe havens and have crossed borders into Myanmar to escape from the Indian armed forces.

The situation has not been resolved despite directions from the Supreme Court. A commission was appointed by the Supreme Court in 2006 to demarcate the boundaries between Nagaland, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.

#### **Meghalaya**

#### **History**

Under the Assam Reorganisation (Meghalaya) Act of 1969, an autonomous state called Meghalaya was established within Assam. Meghalaya was granted statehood in 1972 with its own legislative assembly. It is bound on the north and east by Assam and on the south and west by Bangladesh. Meghalaya meaning 'the Abode of Clouds' is a hilly state and is inhabited by the tribal population of Khasi, Jaintia and Garo.

#### **Insurgency Groups**

#### *Garo National Liberation Army (GNLA)*

The GNLA, formed in 2009, carried out violent attacks, extortions, etc. against the armed forces with an objective of creating a sovereign Garoland that includes the western region of Meghalaya. GNLA operates from Bangladesh with the support of various insurgent groups like ULFA and NDFB of Assam and NSCN-IM of Nagaland.

#### *Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC)*

HNLC is an insurgent organisation of Meghalaya, which claims to represent the aspirations of the Khasi and Jaintia tribal people of liberating Meghalaya from the Garos and other non-tribal outsiders. It strongly believes that the Khasi youth are alienated from development because of the presence of Garo and others in Meghalaya.

The erstwhile Hynniewtrep Achik Liberation Council (HALC), the first militant organisation in Meghalaya, was split in 1992 into various groups over tribal differences. One such new organisation is the HNLC and the Achik Matgrik Liberation Army (AMLA), which is formed by Garo tribes.

It has links with the NSCN-IM, ULFA, NDFB and the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT). With active connivance of ISI in Pakistan, HNLC indulges in the circulation of fake Indian currency notes.

#### *Liberation of Achik Elite Force (LAEF)*

It is a Garo militant outfit formed in 2005 with an objective to free the state from the domination of Khasis and Jaintias, thus creating a separate state for the Garos so that they could enjoy the fruits of development in the state. This group has established linkages with both the terror groups NSCN-IM and NSCN-K of Nagaland.

#### *People's Liberation Front of Meghalaya*

It is relatively a new terrorist outfit that operates from the Garo hills and is now called the Achik National Council (ANC). The objective of the ANC is to create a separate state for the Garos so that economic development reaches the people. It supports economic opportunities and educational development of the Garos. This group maintains close contact with the Achik National Volunteer Council.

Other terrorist/insurgent groups in Meghalaya are:

#### **(i) Active terrorist/insurgent groups**

- Achik National Volunteer Council (ANVC)
- Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC)
- People's Liberation Front of Meghalaya (PLF-M)
- Liberation of Achik Elite Force (LAEF)

#### **(ii) Inactive terrorist/insurgent groups**

• Hajong United Liberation Army (HULA)

#### **Mizoram**

#### **History**

Mizoram, a mountainous region, was granted statehood in 1987. It was a part of Assam till it became a Union Territory in 1972. Initially under British India, the Lushai Hills remained as a part of Assam, while the remaining territory was a part of Bengal.

In 1898 both these parts were merged as Lushai Hills District and placed under the control of the Chief Commissioner of Assam. With the implementation of the North-Eastern Reorganisation Act in 1972, Mizoram became a union territory and is a sequel to the signing of the historic memorandum of settlement between the government and the MNF Mizo National Front in 1986. Mizoram occupies an area of great strategic importance in the northeastern region sharing international borders with Bangladesh and Myanmar. It is known for its richness in flora and fauna and picturesque landscape.

One can see visible shades of British influence in their culture. The Mizo language has no indigenous script; rather it uses the Roman script introduced by the Christian missionaries.

#### *Independence movement and formation of Mizoram*

After independence, this region suffered a lack of development, and there was acute food shortage. Mizos having no satisfaction with the government's response with the *mautam* famine that occurred in 1959 formed the Mizo National Famine Front (MNFF), which later dropped the word famine and formed a political

#### **4.14 Chapter 4 • North East India**

organisation called the Mizo National Front under the leadership of Laldenga in 1961. The goal of MNF was to create a sovereign independent Mizoram. There broke out a large-scale insurgency in 1966, and the Indian government gave a military response by using the air force for the first time against its own citizens.

Under Indira Gandhi's leadership, Mizoram was offered union territory status, and other contentious issues were solved under Rajiv Gandhi's leadership. Losing the support of Pakistan through East Bengal and the formation of Bangladesh left the leaders of the movement to realise that the only way for lasting peace is to participate in the democratic process and to recognise the state's legitimacy. Granting statehood to Mizoram was the basic prerequisite, and a separate Mizoram state was formed in 1987 and elections were held.

#### **Insurgency**

#### *Hmar People's Convention-Democracy*

It is an active insurgent group and is an offshoot of Hmar's people convention, formed in 1986, with an objective of creating an independent Hmar state, consisting of Hmar people living in Assam, Manipur and Mizoram. HPC-D has aligned itself with several insurgency groups in the region. It has links with the NSCN of Nagaland, which has provided arms and training and also carries out a joint operation with the Manipur-based People Liberation Army. It also has strategic links with the other Mizo-based groups, the Bru National Liberation Front.

#### *Bru National Liberation Front*

It is an inactive insurgent group of the Reang community formed after the clashes between ethnic Mizos and the Reang community. Formed in 1996, its main objective was protecting the rights and dignity of the Reangs. Earlier it demanded for a separate state but now the demand has toned down to a district council, which will serve the interests of the Reang people. BNLF, having given up its armed struggle, is keen on participating in the democratic process, and is presently negotiating with the government for an effective solution to the Reang problem.

Mizoram has been peaceful in the last decade.

#### **Tripura**

#### **History**

Tripura, the third smallest state of the Indian Union, has a unique tribal culture and a fascinating folklore. The references of Tripura can be traced from 'Rajmala' chronicles of the kings of Tripura and also in the Hindu epic of *Mahabharatha* and *Puranas* and stone pillar *Edicts of Ashoka*. The rulers of Bengal were supposed to have helped Tripura kings in the 14th century. Further, there are references of Tripura facing repeated Mughal invasions and defeating the Bengal sultans in battles.

In the 19th century, King Maharaja Bir Chandra Kishore Manikya brought in administrative reforms and changed the administrative system on the lines of the British India pattern. Finally in 1949, the state merged with the Indian Union. Though it was given a group 'C' state status initially, in 1972, full statehood was accorded to Tripura.

#### **Insurgency**

#### *All Tripura Tiger force (ATTF)*

In 1990, the All Tripura Tiger Force was formed from the previous All Tripura tribal force. Some of them have surrendered to the government, but the rest of the splinter forces still carry out periodic terrorist attacks. The objective of the group is the expulsion of Bengali immigrants who entered Tripura after 1956, removal of the names of the people who entered Tripura after 1956 from the electoral roll and restoration of the land to the tribals. ATTF is mainly based out of Bangladesh. It has networks with various other terrorist outfits in other states like NSCN-K, ULFA, PLA, etc. ATTF has resisted attempts towards negotiation, and peace has not yet been found.

#### *The National Liberation Front of Tripura*

This organisation has been split several times due to parochial considerations and religious issues. Moreover misappropriation by the leaders, their lavish lifestyle, etc. are also reasons behind the split in this group.

The objective of this group is to create an independent Tripura through an armed struggle, freeing the state from the control and domination of imperialist India. This group has linkages with various terrorist outfits like NSCN-IM, NDFB, etc. It is also known to have linkages with ISI-Pakistan and DGFI-Bangladesh. It is known to have camps in Bhutan and Myanmar.

#### **Manipur**

#### **History**

The history of Manipur goes way back to 50 B.C. and comprises territories of Nagaland, Mizoram and Assam. The Kingdom of Manipur was ruled by several kings since then until the 18th century when it came under the British Rule. In 1947, Manipur attained independence and was then merged with India in 1951. During 1950–51, an Advisory Government was introduced in 1951, which was replaced by a Territorial Council in 1957. It was later granted full statehood in the year 1972.

#### *The Kangleipak Communist Party*

This party based on communist ideology was formed in 1980. Its important aim is to preserve Meitei culture and demands an erstwhile independent Manipur. It considers that the land is occupied by India. Its aim is to create an egalitarian society to address the problems faced by the ethnic Mongoloid group of the southeast Himalayan region. Its activities are mainly concentrated in the valley regions of Manipur. It had established links with a number of valleys that operate from the Manipur valley, NSCN-IM and ULFA.

#### *Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup*

It is a Meitei terrorist group formed in 1994; the name means "It is the organisation to save revolutionary movement in Manipur". The main objective of this movement is to clear Manipur society of the evils plaguing it like drugs, alcohol, corruption, etc. It launched 'Operation New Kangleipak', which was a campaign to rid the educational system of corruption. It has links with NSCN-IM and NSCN-K, and it has given training to the cadres and offered them shelter.

#### *People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK)*

It claims to be a genuine revolutionary party of Manipur. Its main motive is to expel the outsiders from the state. It has close linkages with NSCN-IM. It has received weapons and training from KIA based in Myanmar, and its bases are located in Bangladesh.

#### *People's Liberation Army*

It is a Meitei organisation but claims to represent other tribal groups as well. It aims to organise the entire northeast into a revolutionary front, and bring together all the ethnic groups under a single umbrella. Its political outfit is called the Revolutionary People's Front. It runs a government in exile from Bangladesh, and has links with various terrorists' outfits operating in the northeast. It has links with ISI-Pakistan, which is detrimental to the security of India.

#### *United National Liberation Front*

It is the oldest Meitei insurgent group, which seeks to create an independent and socialist Manipur. Its armed wing is called Manipur People's Army (MPA). It maintains a close association with other insurgent groups. It has its training camps in Myanmar and Bangladesh.

#### *People's United Liberation Front*

Its main objective is to safeguard the interests of the minority Muslim population. Apart from this, it seeks to create a Muslim state in the northeast through armed struggle with support from other Muslim fundamentalist groups. It seeks to establish a state based on Sharia. It has established linkages with ISI-Pakistan.

The terrorist organsations in Manipur are listed as follows:

- 1. United National Liberation Front (UNLF)
- 2. People's Liberation Army (PLA)
- 3. People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK) The above-mentioned groups now operate from a unified platform, the Manipur People's Liberation Front (MPLF)

#### **Inner Line Permit**

Inner Line Permit (ILP) is an official travel document issued by the government of India to grant inward travel of an Indian citizen into a protected area for a limited period. Currently Indian citizens require it to enter the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram.

The document has been issued under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873, and the conditions and restrictions vary from state to state. It can be issued for travel purposes only. Visitors are not allowed to buy property

in these states. However, there might be a different set of rules for long-term visitors, though they are not valid for central-government employees and security forces.

#### MANIPUR'S DEMAND FOR ILP

For the past several months, protests are on, demanding the implementation of the ILP in the state. In 2012, the Manipur assembly passed a resolution to this effect.

The Joint Committee on Inner Line Permit System (JCILPS), the common platform of civil society group in Imphal valley, is spearheading the pro-ILP movement. The state has witnessed several agitations and shutdowns in the last few years on this issue.

#### **Reason for Manipur's ILP Demand**

Before Manipur was united with India, it had its own regulations similar to the ILP system. However, in 1951, the then chief commissioner Himmat Singh removed the regulations and allowed the unregulated entry of outsiders.

As per the JCILPS, according to the 2011 census, the population of Manipur is a little over 27 lakh. Of this, only 17 lakh (1.7 million) are indigenous people and 10 lakh (1 million) are outsiders. Whereas, according to various reports, of about 2.7 million people in Manipur, about 700,000 are of non-Manipuri origin. Whichever is valid, it cannot be denied that the state is encountering an indiscriminate rise of non-natives. The illegal immigration from Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar has also contributed to the crisis.

The cause for concern among the native population is the competition for employment and access to resources with the non-natives. As the immigrants are primarily migrating in search of a livelihood, they are willing to work for a low pay.

#### NAGALAND

#### History

Nagaland was established in 1963. It is bounded on the east by Myanmar, on the north by Arunachal Pradesh, on the west by Assam and on the south by Manipur. It is predominantly mountainous with Mount Saramati as the highest peak in Nagaland.

The Nagas belong to the Indo-Mongoloid race living in Northeast India and the upper portion of West Myanmar. It is estimated that there are over 50 tribes in Nagaland of which the Angami, Ao, Chang, Khiamniungan, Kuki, Konyak, Lotha, Phom, Pochury, Rengma, Sangtam, Yimchungru and Zeliang are major tribes. The language of the Nagas differs from each tribe and even from one village to another.

In the 13<sup>th</sup> century the Nagas settled before the arrival of the Ahoms. In the 19<sup>th</sup> century the British appeared on the scene, and the area was brought

#### **4.20 Chapter 4 • North East India**

under British administration. After independence, in 1957, the territory was established as a centrally administered territory under the governor of Assam. Later in 1961, the territory was renamed as Nagaland and was formally given statehood in 1963.

#### **Road to Statehood**

To participate in World War I, the Naga people were recruited by the British, while in Europe they were forced to settle their differences and started to think of unifying various tribal groups to strive towards a common interest. The Naga nationalist movement was established in 1918, shortly after the First World War.

Several violent movements broke out since independence that demanded autonomy to the Naga people. The government used the army to suppress the violence. The Naga union territory was created in 1957 as a result of the diplomatic talks held between the government and Naga representatives. But agitation for the demand of more powers broke out and later in 1963; an agreement was signed to grant statehood to Nagaland.

#### **Later Insurgency Movement**

The Naga National Council was initially a political organsation of the Naga people. Under the leadership of Angami Zepn Pizo in the 1940s, it actively campaigned for the cessation of the Naga territory from India.

Violence was resorted to by the Naga Nationalist Council cadres as they did not agree to that of granting statehood to Nagaland. Peace talks failed to resolve the issue. The government was forced to launch a massive counterinsurgency operation against the group. Finally, in 1975 the Shillong Accord was signed; it accepted the allegiance to the Constitution of India without any condition.

Some section of the council did not agree to the agreement and formed a separate group called the Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland in 1980. The group is in turn split into two factions based on tribal differences as NSCN-Isak-Muivah and Khaplang. Both the splinter groups share the same objective establishing a greater Nagalim consisting of areas inhabited by the Nagas in Nagaland, Assam, Manipur, Arunachal and Myanmar.

In 1997, a ceasefire agreement was signed between NSCN-IM and the government and has been extending till this day. In 2001 the government also signed a ceasefire agreement with the Khaplang faction.

Even though the ceasefire agreement exists, violent attacks are still carried out, and armed forces are not able to take any action against the perpetrators of violence. Ethnic conflict in Nagaland is an ongoing battle between the ethnic Nagas and Tangkhuls.

#### **Peace Process**

Various associations like the Naga Hoho and Naga Mother's Association play an active role in bringing peace to the movement. Civil society and churches also play an active role in bringing reconciliation between the warring factions. Now the people have organised a number of peace marches across the state, and these efforts by the civil society have transformed the region and brought in a settlement of differences between various ethnic groups. Civil society represents a wide section of the people in the grassroots and have called for peace and turning such activities into better productive work.

#### **Insurgency Groups**

#### *Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland – Isak-Muivah*

NSCN underwent a vertical split due to differences in agreeing to the peace process with the Indian government. It was led by Isak Chisi Swu and Thuingalang Muivah with an aim to establishing a greater Nagaland based on the Maoist ideology on the principle of socialism and equitable economic development to the people. It primarily consists of Tangkhul Nagas. Its major source of income is through drug trafficking and also runs a parallel government and also gets supports from the ISI of Pakistan and Myanmar.

#### **Naga Peace Accord**

The Naga Peace Accord, a framework agreement as it has been termed, signed between the National Socialist Council of Nagalim-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM) and the government of India on 3 August 2015 is significant for several reasons. First, it shows the flexibility and realism of the NSCN (IM) in terms of the willingness to alter goals, from complete sovereignty and Greater Nagalim to acceptance of the constitutional framework albeit with a provision for the grant of greater autonomy to Naga-inhabited areas outside of Nagaland through the establishment of autonomous district councils. This indeed had been a sticking point in negotiations as Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Manipur had categorically stated their opposition to any territorial division. It is pertinent to note here that a similar proposal called the 'supra-state structure' was offered by government of India negotiators in 2011. This involved the grant of greater autonomy for Naga areas without a territorial division of the other states involved. But opposition from Manipur Chief Minister Ibobi Singh meant that an agreement could not be signed.

Second, the signing of the accord at this moment in time discloses that the platform of social support for the NSCN (IM) comprising Naga civil-society groups are insistent on a peaceful path to conflict resolution. Since November

#### **4.22 Chapter 4 • North East India**

2014, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to Nagaland promised a peaceful settlement with the NSCN (IM) within 18 months, Naga civil-society groups like the Forum for Naga Reconciliation, Naga Hoho, Eastern Naga Peoples' Organisation, Naga Mothers' Association, Naga Students' Federation and the specific Hohos of the 14 Naga tribes have been regularly holding consultations with the NSCN (IM) and Government Interlocutor R. N. Ravi on arriving at a settlement at the earliest. The accord arrived at now ends the ceasefire process in existence since 1997 and locks in the NSCN (IM)'s commitment to peaceful dialogue. The urgency to get a peace deal breakthrough had risen in the backdrop of the rival NSCN (K) abrogating its ceasefire with the government of India on 27 March 2015 and following it up with the June 4 ambush in Manipur that killed 20 military personnel.

Third, the leaders of the NSCN (IM), Thuingaleng Muivah and Isak Chisi Swu (who has been unwell for some time now) have been forthcoming since 2011 to sign a framework agreement that pledges to preserve the culture, history and traditions of the Nagas and grants greater autonomy to Naga-inhabited areas outside of Nagaland. Fourth, Modi's own promise to resolve the Naga conflict within an 18-month time frame must have been a factor in the signing of the framework agreement.

#### *Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland – Khaplang*

The Khaplang unit of the NSCN has been on sour terms with the government of India, so much so that they have regularly kept away from the negotiation table. It is reported that the faction has been consistently moving closer to Myanmar's Tatmadaw (Myanmar's Army), which provides them the logistics to operate from Myanmar's territory. It is also speculated that the faction is getting closer with separatist outfits from India's northeastern states that have camps in the region to form a government in exile, comprising the northeast region (NER) and the Naga regions in Myanmar, with a moving capital. The close association of Tatmadaw with the faction is said to be based on the mineral-rich regions under the control of the Nagas. The exploitation of these resources for Myanmar can only be possible, when having a peaceful relationship with the insurgents.

Differences between two tribal groups of Konyaks and Tangkhuls formed the basis of split of NSCN in 1988. The Khaplang faction led by Khole Konyak and S. S. Khaplang consists of the Konyak Nagas. It has a similar aim as that of NSCN-IM to create a greater Nagalim and it also runs a government in exile called the People's Republic of Nagaland. NSCN-K, based in Myanmar, is very active now. In the worst attack on the India Army, 18 soldiers were killed and injured in an ambush in Manipur on June 2015. The army was deployed to maintain peace against the activities of the group.

#### **Active Terrorist/Insurgent Groups**

- National Socialist Council of Nagaland Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM)
- National Socialist Council of Nagaland Khaplang (NSCN-K)
- National Socialist Council of Nagaland Unification (NSCN-U)

#### **Inactive terrorist/insurgent groups**

• Naga National Council (Adino) – NNC (Adino)

#### **Factors Responsible for Insurgency in the Northeast**

The factors that are responsible for insurgency in the northeast are as follows:

- The tribal people feel alienated and deprived.
- People have ethnic relationships with the people of neighbouring countries like Myanmar.
- Porous borders between India and Myanmar make it easy for the infiltration of people, difficult for security forces to prevent it.
- Infiltration from across the border changes the demographic pattern.
- Corruption.
- Lack of a visionary leader to guide the tribes.
- Lack of basic amenities makes the development tardy.
- Easy availability of arms and ammunitions.
- Support of political parties.
- Condition of instability in the neighbourhood.

Countries like Pakistan offer support, shelter, arms, etc. to various insurgent groups through its ISI agencies. China also plays a role in supporting, training some insurgent groups which have communist inclination. Insurgent groups use other neighbourhood countries as their base for operation. Since the crackdown by Bhutan and Bangladesh, these groups of extremists have vacated the neighbouring territories.

#### **Government's Response to Northeast Extremism**

A composite strategy followed by the government includes holding talks with groups. Ceasefire agreements have been made with most of the insurgent groups, and SOP is in place in almost the entire region. The government has always pushed for talks and negotiation with various groups. The government is striving to bring in the fruits of development to the northeast region, and in this it is willing to hold talks with the groups that agree to participate in the democratic process within the constitution of India.

#### **4.24 Chapter 4 • North East India**

The basic principles on which decisions of the government are based are as follows:

- Special schemes are for the northeast region
- Special package for infrastructure development
- Proportionate and effective use of force
- Handling of issue with the tool of negotiation and dialogue
- Providing effective political autonomy
- Decentralisation of power and protection of the rights of the tribes
- Improvement of connectivity through roadways and railways in the region
- 'Look east' policy will ensure northeast as the gateway to east Asia
- Generate investments by organising business summits
- Creating awareness by conducting exhibitions and seminars

#### **Counter Insurgency – Steps Being Taken**

A multi-pronged approach is required to tackle terrorism; some of the steps are as follows:

- Having effective communication and proper connectivity.
- Improving the infrastructure in the northeastern region.
- Conducting talks with the insurgent groups.
- Coordination between the centre's and state's force is essential for success.
- Tough laws and quick resolving of terrorism-related cases.
- Effective criminal justice system.
- Non-tolerance of violence in any form.
- Creating greater interaction with the rest of the country for better assimilation and understanding.
- Making the government's presence felt.
- Holistic and equitable development needs to happen for better socioeconomic condition.
- Decentralising power to the people and monitoring its application.
- Improving administrative efficiency.
- Good governance with pro-public initiatives.
- Setting up of separate high courts in Manipur, Meghalaya and Tripura.
- Giving platform to regional aspirations.

#### **Recommendations of Bezberua Committee**

Five key recommendations made by the Bezbaruah Committee on tackling discrimination against the community are as follows.

**New law against discrimination:** Either a new law should be created as directed by the High Court of Delhi, or the Indian Penal Code should be amended. The offence should be cognisable and non-bailable. The investigation of the FIR should be completed within 60 days by a special squad and investigated by a police officer not below the rank of deputy SP or ACP. A special prosecutor should be appointed to handle all such cases of atrocities. And the trial should be completed within 90 days.

**Fast-track courts and special police squads:** The Committee strongly suggests the creation of fast-track courts for handling the cases relating to the northeastern people, particularly those which are racially motivated and involving heinous crimes against northeastern women and children. Specially designated public prosecutors should be appointed for cases involving people from the northeast. They should also be properly trained and sensitised.

The committee feels that the creation of a special squad supervised by the North East Special Police Unit would go a long way in ensuring speedy justice in criminal cases. The squad could be manned by people specially selected for such purposes, and they could be specially trained and sensitised about the problems of people from the northeast.

**Interventions in education:** Suitable innovative ways should be devised to integrate each and every aspect of the northeast into the consciousness of people outside. The Committee recommends that when the next NCERT takes place two things should be emphasised: (i) all teacher training institutes should be advised to make their syllabus in a way that can sensitise their trainees on the North East, and (ii) universities and schools outside the northeast should make projects on the northeast a mandatory part of the course curricula.

Large migration of students for higher education in Delhi and other metros has been a prominent feature in recent times. One reason for such an exodus is the absence of institutions of excellence in the northeast. A detailed socioeconomic study of the nature of student migration from the North East would be worthwhile as it will provide valuable insight for planning of higher education in the region.

**Social-media outreach and legal-awareness campaigns:** The committee recommends legal-awareness campaigns in neighbourhoods that have a significant presence of members from the northeastern community and on introducing lectures on legal rights for university students. It underlines the role of social media in improving connectivity and communication with the community. A dedicated Facebook page should be created, and nodal police officers should be in constant touch with members of the community on WhatsApp.

**Bonding power of sports:** The committee recommends that the ministry should take steps to hold regular national and international events in the northeast as such events will create greater harmony and better understanding. The ministry should, therefore, review the status of present facilities and make an assessment if they are suitable for such events. If not, such facilities should be created in every state of the northeast. Indigenous games of the northeast should be promoted.

#### **Development of Northeast Region**

Development plays an important role in ensuring that the security of a state is maintained. It is when development goes haywire that the people go for agitations

#### **4.26 Chapter 4 • North East India**

with a view to claim what is their rightful entitlement. In this context, the NER gives a promising picture, by faring pretty well across several indices of development. These can be broadly studied under the following domains.

#### **Gross State Domestic Product**

All of the northeastern states put together are showing a faster growth rate, when compared to the other major states in India. This is due to their industrial and service sectors, which are progressing at a consistent pace.

- Meghalaya, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh recorded the highest growth rates in GSDP in 2013–14.
- Meghalaya's growth in GSDP of 9.7 per cent was equivalent to Bihar, which had a GSDP growth rate of 9.1 per cent.
- Arunachal Pradesh, with a growth rate in GSDP of 8.9 per cent grew faster than Gujarat, which reported 8.7 per cent.

\* Fewer people, 12.8 million, live below the poverty line in the entire northeast than in just one large state, Karnataka, which has 12.9 million poor people.

In Mizoram, for example, the growth rate for agriculture and allied activities went down from 16.4 per cent in 2010–11 to 0.07 per cent in 2013–14.

#### **Unemployment Higher in Urban Areas**

Unemployment is a key concern in the NER. When the promising growth rates do not translate into commensurate number of jobs, it leads to youngsters turning towards unlawful means of making a living – the most prevalent being insurgency.

In the NER, it is reported that Tripura with 25.2 per cent shows the highest unemployment rate in urban areas, followed by Nagaland with 23.8 per cent.

#### **Poverty Levels**

The poverty levels in some states of the NER are comparatively lower to some of the larger states. For instance, the percentage of population below the poverty line in Sikkim was 13.1 per cent in 2009–10, and it fell to 8.2 per cent in 2011–12. In comparison, poverty in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh – the larger states most successful in cutting poverty – fell from 36.7 to 31.7 per cent and 37.7 to 29.4 per cent, respectively, over the same period. Similarly, in Meghalaya, the percentage of population below the poverty line was 17.1 per cent in 2009–10 and fell to 11.9 per cent in 2011–12.

However, this upper hand of a few states cannot be considered as the case across all states of the NER. While 8.2 per cent of the population is below the poverty line in Sikkim, 36.9 per cent people live below the poverty line in Manipur.

According to the National Institute of Rural Development (NIRD), although the number of people below the poverty line may be lower than the national average, the intensity of poverty is much higher in these states.

#### **Transport Sector**

The NER contains nearly 12 per cent of the total length of national highways in the country. Assam holds the lion's share of 30.9 per cent of national highways in NER and also leads the surfaced state-highway density in the region with 42 per cent.

Given the hilly terrains and numerous rivers, building railway lines is a tough task in the NER. Presently, the entire NER has 2,646 km of railways. Except for around 179 km, the rest is within Assam. Expanding the railway network will help in supplementing trade routes with neighbouring countries, like Bangladesh and Myanmar.

Even in terms of air connectivity, the NER lags behind. The 8 northeastern states have a total of 9 airports. Presently, 3 airports are under construction at Holongi, Tezu and Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh, which had no airports earlier.

#### **Power Production**

Thanks to the growth in the number of hydel-power projects, Sikkim is the only state in the country to be a power-surplus state. Rest of the NER states face acute power deficits. The major issues in the development of hydropower projects are delays in environment and forest clearances, land acquisition, development of infrastructure and long-term financing.

#### **Literacy**

Mizoram has the highest literacy rate in the NER. It takes the third position behind Kerala and Lakshadweep at the national level. Besides, it is also the pioneer in female literacy with 89.3 per cent of the women literate, thanks to the efforts of NGOs, church schools and village councils. Arunachal Pradesh had the lowest literacy rate among the 8 northeastern states with 65.4 per cent in 2011, the second lowest in India. About 77 per cent of Arunachal Pradesh's population is rural, where the literacy rate is 59.9 per cent. It also has the lowest female literacy rate in the northeast: 57.7 per cent.

#### **Infant Mortality**

Assam had India's worst infant mortality rate (IMR), with 54 deaths per 1,000 live childbirths in 2013, the same as the African nation of Burundi, according to the World Bank. Insurgency-wracked Manipur – often termed a failed state – is the safest place for childbirth in India, with the country's lowest infant mortality rate, the same as Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and equivalent to that of Oman and the Bahamas, according to the World Bank and the Indian government.

#### **Ease of Doing Business**

The NER states have fared poorly in the ease-of-doing-business ranking list as given by the World Bank.

The ranking takes into account factors such as policies, practices or procedures spread across 10 reform areas spanning the life cycle of a typical business. These are mainly single-window clearance, tax reforms, labour and environment reforms, dispute resolution and construction permits.

While Tripura has moved 4 places up to 22nd position from last year's 26th position with 16.67 points, Assam has slipped from 22nd position to 24th position with 14.29 points. The rest of the NER states, namely, Nagaland secured 26th rank, Manipur was placed 28th followed by Mizoram, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya with rankings of 29th, 30th and 31st ranks, respectively.

To address the region's development challenges, including infrastructure, the central government created the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region in 2004. A sum of Rs. 2,362 crore was allocated to the ministry in 2015– 16 in order to address the various challenges to socio-economic development. The grants from the Centre and their share in central taxes together form 79 per cent of their total revenue, according to the Reserve Bank of India.

### **Practice Questions**
