# ReseaRch in sociology of law

## Joginder S. Gandhi

The present survey of research in the field of sociology of law in India covers the period from 1980 to 2006. This subject was included in the first two rounds of survey carried out by the ICSSR, but was not taken in the third round. An attempt is therefore made here to cover the entire period of the third and the fourth rounds so that the history of this sub-specialty is brought on a par with other sub-fields of Indian sociology.

# **First and Second Surveys**

The first trend report on sociology of law in India was prepared by Veena Das and covered all the studies up to 19691 . The second report was prepared by Upendra Baxi, which covered the period from 1970 through 19802 . Both these reports had diverse foci and were guided by different perceptions of this area of research.

The first report by Veena Das was inspired largely by an anthropological perception of the field of sociology of law. Without giving a precise definition of law, she takes 'Sociology of Law to mean a general area of interest in which the major focus is on processes of dispute settlement through variable structural arrangements'. Thus, she divides her discussion into

- 1. Processes of dispute settlement;
- 2. Judicial behaviour;
- 3. The legal profession; and
- 4. Law and the wider society

Her aim in that review was '… not to retrieve all the ethnographic material that is scattered in anthropological literature but to do an operational survey of the potentialities of the subject, with special emphasis on the methods of data collection'. Further, her 'main emphasis' was 'on description of issues and important works in the field, and not on exhaustive coverage, which would not have been possible within the limited space allowed for this survey'.

The second survey, by Upendra Baxi—a law teacher and a jurisprudential scholar—runs into as many as 126 pages3 . He engaged extensively in various textual and polemic issues such as (1) what is Sociology of Law in India and the West, and (2) what ought to be the coverage of the subject area. He subdivided his review into the following categories:

- 1. Studies on classical Hindu law
- 2. Law and social change: the colonial experience
- 3. Law and social change: some aspects of contemporary experience
- 4. People's law or non-state legal systems
- 5. Tribal law and justice
- 6. Nyaya panchayats
- 7. Law and social control
- 8. Adjudication under state legal systems

Obviously, there are points of congruence and disjuncture between the two approaches—that of Veena Das and Upendra Baxi. But Veena Das's approach is much more composite and unitary in character, being anthropological in the analytical idiom. Baxi has followed the indexing approach—staying away from any consistent disciplinary focus and covering issues which are generally associated with discussions on the law and legal system, law and social change, the traditional institutions of justice-delivery, etc.

Upendra Baxi has proposed a somewhat overambitious catalogue of the 'relevant areas' relative to sociology of law. However, it is difficult to conceive of a single consistent paradigm for reviewing researches related to the Indian legal system, which functions in a complex cultural milieu and a long historical tradition.

Quite importantly, both these surveys emphasize the value of studying the *classical tradition* of law in India as a backdrop to the study of law and the legal system in the contemporary context. This aspect has been well covered by Baxi under the discussion titled 'Classical Hindu Law', wherein he is mostly guided by accounts of law and the legal system as provided by Western scholars, such as J. D. M. Derret (1968) and Robert Lingat (1998). This is despite the fact that between the classical India and the modern India, some changes of gigantic proportions followed in the wake of the Muslim rule and the British occupation of India. Various traditions of law and the legal system—*ancient, medieval,* and of the *British period—*did leave their specific imprints on the modern legal system in India, but their analysis cannot be done in simplistic and linear terms. Instead, it has to be in terms of intersection of historicity, polity, and political contingencies.

#### *Perspective in the Present Survey*

In one way or the other, every report or survey is guided by some distinctive focus which is often partly subjective, as is apparent from a comparison of the previous two surveys. The perspective being followed here is different from the preceding two surveys in that it focuses more on the formal institutional settings subsisting within the Indian legal system, i.e. legal profession, judiciary, and certain notable and sociologically relevant aspects of the emergent legal culture in India. All these will be focused upon as is evidenced by the material that appeared between 1980 and 2005.

Even though the earlier surveys did not specifically go into the formal legal institutions as is done here; an effort has been made to supply a pedagogic rationale for the approach. One must note that law, legal norms, and legal impulses permeate India's entire social life and social system, including a variety of institutional settings such as the polity and administration. Also, in one's day-to-day life, one is often brought face-to-face with several subaltern versions of rules and norms—through shocking incidents such as a village panchayat over-ruling the legitimacy of a certain inter-caste marriage has not only ostracizing the 'guilty' couple and their families, but also employing violent means. The variety of socially enforceable laws and rules in our society is indeed mind-boggling and cannot all be included in the survey on sociology of law. It may be suggested that the ICSSR float a separate survey for anthropology/ethnology of law. In brief, the argument here is only that the field of study, i.e. *sociology of law*, must be bounded and circumscribed to a certain extent in order to facilitate its focused development as a discipline, thereby promoting a composite understanding of the contemporary legal system in India. Additionally, such an approach would also enable comparison of the state of discipline in India and in the Western world.

As far as the global spread of the field of sociology of law is concerned, it has developed in societies which are self-governing and self-regulating4 the logic being, that the necessity for social order and governance gives rise to the necessity for legal innovations and improvisations, paving the way for the development of the discipline. This assertion is proved by contrasting the historicity of the Western world with Indian society, which has suffered subjugation by the British for over two hundred years.

As of now, it may be said that, unlike in the West, sociology of law has not gained a significant entry into the curricula of sociology in Indian universities although certain aspects of it are taught as part of teaching in criminology, deviant behaviour, or sociology of professions with special focus on human rights.

However, it is encouraging to note that some autonomous law-teaching institutes, called National Law Institutes, which have come up recently, do include in their syllabi an introductory course in sociology5 . This is an encouraging sign. But more than this, the growth of the discipline depends on some credible researches in the various components of the modern legal system such as the judiciary, legal profession, court-settings, court-culture, etc. It is to be hoped that this conjoining of the legal system and social science methodology will lay the foundations for a vibrant sociology of law speciality in India.

#### *Innovative Departures in the Study of Sociology of Law*

Given the rather inchoate nature of sociology of law in India, the effort here is to identify the *sociological thrust* in various writings and researches on law, legal institutions, and the legal system. People of different specialities, including some sociologists, have authored these writings.

One way to identify literature in 'sociology of law in India', or literature with a sociological stance*,* is to take note of diverse writings broadly related to law, legal culture and the legal system in India. One such endeavour that has recently surfaced (2005) is a compendium of materials titled *Sociology of Law* edited by Indra Deva (2005), who retired as Professor of Sociology from Ravi Shankar University, Raipur, Chhattisgarh. He devised an ingenious schema to assimilate some select materials by social scientists and others like law academics, jurists, social activists, and lawyers.

The six-fold schema devised by Indra Deva is as follows:

**1. Functions of the Legal System.** This includes topics which generally correspond to this thematic classification, such as 'The Colonial Nature of the Indian Legal System'; 'Administration of Hindu Law by the British'; 'Patterns of Criminal Justice among the Tribes'; 'Law and the People', and 'Law as an Instrument of Social Change'. Among the contributors in this section are a sociologist, a law teacher, a lawyer, a retired Supreme Court judge and an administrator. One may, however, point out that all the entries under this section cannot be styled as studies in the *functioning or functions of the legal system.*

**2. The Legal Profession.** Three entries, one by a sociologist and two by law academics, Samuel Schmitthener (2005) deals with the historical development of the legal profession in India. Charles Morrison (2005: 131–53) and K.L. Sharma (2002: 131–43) deal the with colleague-relationship among lawyers at a district court setting and the lawyer-client relationship at the district court in Rajasthan, respectively.

**3. Law and Religious Identity.** All the four entries in this section are by scholars from abroad— three by social scientists and one by an Indian political scientist teaching in the United States of America. The papers deal with topical issues, e.g. '*Law, Religion, and Secularism*' (Donald Eugene Smith); 'Personal Laws or a Uniform Civil Code' (John H. Mansfield); 'The Personal Law Question and the Hindu Nationalism' (Dieter Conrad); and 'The Shah Bano Case: Some Political Implications' (Kavita R. Khoray). Even though classified by Indra Deva as writings with a 'sociology of law' import, the materials contained in these studies deal primarily with the interpretation of the constitutional provisions relating to individual liberty, majority-minority relations, rule of law, and nationhood.

**4. Law and the Disadvantaged Groups.** The four papers in this section deal with the alleviation of the conditions of some disadvantaged categories such as the scheduled castes, backward castes, and women. Marc Galanter's 'Pursuing Equality in the Land of Hierarchy' (1989) tries to weigh some of the constitutional and policy initiatives, such as the policy of job-reservations, against the traditionally engendered inequality in society and also the successes, or failures, that have marked

#### 562 Joginder s. gandhi

these state initiatives. M.P. Singh (1990–91) also examines the constitutionality of the policy of job-reservations. Ram Jethmalani (1990–91), a leading lawyer and politician, has penned a brief write-up justifying the recommendations made by the Mandal Commission in favour of Other Backward Castes (OBCs). It is more a kind of political exhortation than a cool analysis of its pros and cons. S.P. Sathe (1993), a law academic and formerly director of an institute of legal studies, critically probes the adequacy of legal initiatives in empowering women in society.

**5. Societal Role of Judiciary.** This section has two entries, both concerning public interest Litigation. The first, 'Towards an Indian Jurisprudence of Social Action and Public Interest Litigation; by well-known retired Supreme Court Judge V.R. Krishna Iyer extols the bold ventures made by the Indian judiciary in expanding the ambit of 'access' to a much larger group of mostly indigent litigants, than entitled by the conventional principle of the rule of law. This is done by underplaying the insistence on some of the well-worn judicial principles such as that of *locus standi*. The second article, 'Public Interest Litigation' by law academic and advocate Mahabaleshwar N. Morje, recounts how, through the newly introduced practice of public interest litigation, some fundamental and path-breaking departures have been made from the traditional rule of law and *locus standi* which have gone a long way in safeguarding the interests of the disadvantaged and the indigent citizens, such as those living on the pavements in Mumbai.6

**6. Law and Social Change.** The entries under this section are typically in the sociological mould. Indra Deva and Shrirama in their 'Growth of Traditional Legal System: The Perspective of Change through the Ages' examine the dynamism of the traditional legal system, strongly maintaining that it was neither static, nor a monolith. Instead, it has been growing in concepts and their translation through execution. For example, they maintain that; 'The *Dharamasastras* seem to contain material of widely different eras. While some portions because of their Vedic language appear to be in the direct line of the Vedas, others strike as post-Buddhist and products of the age of Brahmanical revival. The latter are quite close in their spirit and contents to the *Smritis.* It is remarkable that the *Dharamasastras* do not claim a divine origin. They are avowedly composed by human beings. This is in sharp contrast to *Smritis*' (Deva 2005: 328).

In the second piece 'Law and Social Change in India', Yogendra Singh (2005) examines the relationship of law with society in India in the historical and structural context. Quite perceptively regarding the philosophy of change that has been embedded in the Constitution, he maintains, that

It incorporates both the elements of the liberal democratic tradition and Gandhian values on social change ideology. This can be discerned in the dualism that one would find in the fundamental rights and the directive principles of state policy. The former is rational, liberal and individualistic in ethos, whereas the latter lays down the principle of communal welfare, decentralization of power, amelioration of the condition of the weaker sections and the backward classes, and commitment to abolition of practices considered unhealthy in the Gandhian tradition, for example, liquor consumption. (ibid.: 346)

The final entry in this edited work is 'Constitutions and Revolutions*'* by Peter G. Sack (2005: 352–61), an Australian anthropologist of law. He mounts a severe attack on the formal structure of the Indian Constitution as hammered out by the Constituent Assembly. He maintains that the constitutional format ought to have given prominence to the concept of India being a *society.* Rather, it gives prominence to the Indian *state,* whose task and duty it is to secure freedom, democracy, and fraternity to the individual citizens. Ensuing from this he also argues rather caustically that the tradition and culture of society are given a dangerous go by (2005: 352–61).

The above edited work has been examined at some length primarily for two reasons: (1) to understand the meaning and essence of the literature that is relevant from the point of view of Sociology of Law; and (2) to convey the challenge of writing a survey of sociology of law, which the editor here has tried to achieve by putting together an assortment of writings drawn from diverse sources but of broader relevance within the scope of sociology of law*.* Therefore, the contributors to this field are not only sociologists, but also anthropologists, lawyers, journalists, and social activists.

There is yet another, relatively recent account of the Hindu legal tradition by Indra Deva. He has made observations on the nature of law and legal institutions in classical India, which refute some of the rather simplistic interpretations of the Indian system by the Western scholars. For example, he departs from Lingat who maintained that the *Dharamsastras* did not contain any definitive legal provisions, but instead provided only a framework for legal reasoning. He argues that the "Smritis of Narada, Brhaspati and Katyayana lay down meticulously, and in great detail, the law containing a wide variety of matters, the procedure to be followed by courts, and specify precisely the quantum of punishments for different type of offences" (Deva 2003: 16). The *Smritis* also classify as many as 18 types of disputes, which approximate the typologies of disputes available under the modern criminal law and criminal code. Further, Indra Deva says that the *Smritis* also elaborate various stages of dispute settlement, and analyse the roles of various court-personnel. 'It is, therefore, difficult to agree with Lingat's observation that the *Dharamasastras* only offered some framework for judicial reasoning' (ibid.: 17). Indra Deva highlights the point that kings were not supposed to lay down the laws, which was done by the *Smritis.* Also, the kings could not dispense justice single-handedly; the judges, ministers, learned Brahmans, the *purohitas,* and *sabhyas* assisted them (ibid.: 17). 'The overall evidence of the *Smriti* texts shows an admirably practical approach of balancing the demands of the custom and the requirements of various professional, ethnic, territorial groups, on the one hand, and the dicta of the *Dharamasastras,* on the other' (ibid.: 18).

 The importance of this observation lies in that the self-willed and autocratic character of justice-administration, often attributed to monarchies elsewhere in the world, was not present in early Indian society. Instead, it was substantially moderated by the obligatory presence and participation in the judicial process of several useful role-occupants.

 Another input into justice-dispensation was the ruling customs of the groups and communities, especially where *Sastric* (scriptural) guidelines were absent, or were not relevant7 . These important inputs into the judicial process can be appreciated in view of the inexhaustible socio-religious and cultural diversity that has always been a part and parcel of the Indian society.

As the developments in the field of study mentioned in the succeeding sections show, some important sociological departures have indeed been made. These studies have focussed upon the overall legal system and the functioning of courts and their sociological problematique. As a part of the contemporary sharpening of the culture of the civic society*,* certain issues have emerged that are of central concern for both the judiciary and the legal profession, such as the protection of ecology and human rights (e.g. child rights, gender discrimination, the rights and protection of the elderly, the rights of HIV patients, the right to information). In the present review, therefore, we shall take into cognisance the writings that have appeared in these areas. Since most of these issues have been initiated in the courts by some well-known NGOs and some public-spirited persons, they appear under the discussion on public interest litigation (PIL).

# **Critique of the Indian Legal System, its Legitimacy, Etc.**

During the period under review, there emerged a critique of the Indian legal system in its present shape and form. The criticism has focused on the inability of the system to meet the needs of the present democratic society. Even from a pedagogic and philosophical point of view, it is a very relevant enquiry because a legal system crafted during more than two centuries of alien rule cannot meet the demands of an emerging democratic society. Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer (1984: 6–7) aptly remarked:

If law must serve life—the life of the many, million masses whose lot has been blood, toil, tears and sweat—the crucifixion of the Indo-Legal system and the resurrection of the Indian system is an imperative of independence. (1984: 153)

 As might be expected, most of the critiques of the legal system have been launched by social scientists or law academics. In the following are illustrations that are comparatively more coherent and closer to what may be loosely termed as a socio-cultural perspective*.*

We start with the critical observations of a well-known law academic, Upendra Baxi (1982a), on the crisis afflicting the Indian legal system.

Baxi bemoans the fact that there is a near complete '*collapse of the legitimacy*' (ibid.) of the contemporary legal system in India. The system is disregarded with compunction by the political elite who use it as an instrument in their power games. The same behavioural pattern percolates down to the people who regard law more as an 'irritating inconvenience' to be avoided and by-passed if possible, rather than as a facility for an orderly conduct of social life. Endemic corruption both economic and political, the abuse and often overuse of power—buttresses this tendency even more. Organized countervailing power as manifested through both the violent and non-violent variety of agitation-politics, notwithstanding their utility in uncovering governmental lapses, further erodes the legitimacy of the legal system. Various agitating groups use the high danger-quotient of their direct action strategy to pressurize the administration into submission. As a result, politics by manipulation comes to be regarded as the dependable strategy. All this entails the erosion of legitimacy of the legal system. As pointed out by Baxi, it is not just the agitating groups from the general public who resort to manipulation and disregard of the law. Rather, the government also resorts to distortion and misrepresentation. What is poignant is the government's own weak or low-level commitment to legalism or the rule of law. The Chasnala8 mine disaster involving substitute labour, a practice forbidden by law, occurred in the nationalized sector. The Contract Labour (Abolition) Act does not apply to the public sector. The government went right up to the Supreme Court protesting against the compensation awarded to the widows of people killed in accidents while performing governmental duty and the defence of sovereign immunity. Recently, the state of Haryana appealed to the Court against the decision of the High Court liberating the widow of a person run over by a Haryana bus from paying court fees (she could not afford it).

Baxi follows up this critique of legitimacy by a critique of the various components of the legal system itself. He points out certain antinomies and contradictions within the Indian Constitution. These occur both by mutually inconsistent legal provisions as well as through an antipathy between the provisions as inscribed within the Constitution and the way they are actualized. For example, despite the constitutional objectives of equality, fraternity, liberty, dignity, and justice, law-making, law-enforcement, and adjudication continue to have a backward orientation. Also, despite a strong constitutional emphasis on developing the decentralization of political power through the principle of federalism, the Centre continues to wield almost unlimited power vis-à-vis the states. The actual operation of the Constitution over the years, for example, has not resulted in any set of restraining conventions on the constitutional power of the Union of India to declare President's Rule in the states, or to impose Emergency in the country. Further, no conventions regarding such matters as the appointment of Chief Justice of India and appointment and transfer of judges, declaration of election expenses, etc., have so far been evolved. All these tend to create continuing uncertainties and dilemmas in the Indian legal system (Baxi 1982b).

Baxi also elucidates the principle of legal liberalism, as enunciated by Max Weber (Warren 1988: 31–50), and suggests that this principle is utterly neglected in the Indian context. He also highlights the stranglehold of the colonial legal system in that both law making and law implementation continue to follow a non-participative, 'top-down' model. The people at large in various organizational forums such as panchayats or various other prominent social institutions such as universities, bar, media, other organized groups and voluntary bodies are never consulted by law-making agencies (ibid.: 47).

There are occasional sermons that people should help the state make the laws effective, that they should not withhold active co-operation from the law-enforcement agencies, that they should develop a civic competence, a stake in the maintenance of social control and promotion of social change. All this rhetoric is no doubt nobly inspired but the legal systems as structured provide little or no effective scope for public participation in the implementation of legislation… Broadly, the ILS follows the colonial model of reactive mobilization of the law rather than pro-active mobilization (ibid.: 47).

The same colonial model is followed with regard to citizens' access to law. Sometimes, even the barest information on a law is difficult to come by.

Normative law is virtually inaccessible to the most underprivileged and vulnerable groups in Indian society—legal illiteracy of the beneficiaries of law, thus contributes to its ineffectiveness, e.g.: prisoners may not even get to see the jail manuals when distinguished criminologists find it extremely hard to get a copy. Neither the bonded labour nor the landless labour has much idea of the law and the uses that can be made of it (ibid.: 49).

Even, the judiciary pays obeisance to this policy of withholding information. There is no developed system followed by the Supreme Court for sharing information on decisions and judgments given, with its subordinate High Courts. Not merely this, the Supreme Court follows the dubious practice of 'classifying' certain decisions, so that information on them need not be made open (ibid.: 50).

A leading law publisher who has unsuccessfully tried to get the judgments of the Supreme Court `classified,' found that during the 1950–55 period, as many as 250 decisions were classified by the Court as 'nonreportable' (Baxi 1982c).

Yet another telling evidence of the perpetuation of the colonial character of the Indian legal system is that even the right of indigent clients was recognized quite belatedly, and when it was, both the state and the profession showed very little enthusiasm for participating in the formulation of a comprehensive scheme. The reason given for by the government for this is the insufficiency of finance.

After all these critical comments on the declining legitimacy and the unresponsive character of the Indian legal system, Baxi sets out to examine its chief institutional components such as courts, police, law-reform commission, and jail administration. He concludes that they are all characterized by slowness, retrogression, ad hocism, casualness, and a violent disregard for the rules that ought to be followed while dispensing justice.

After a thorough critique of the present Indian legal system, Baxi makes the following observations:

First, that the system is not likely to collapse under the weight of its own degeneration as is generally thought it would, on account of its pliability in the hands of the better-off and the *status quoist* sections of society; and second, that one way it can acquire certain meaningfulness is through its integration with some of the time-honoured traditional Indian institutions, such as the *Panchayats* or *Nyaya Panchayats,* which need to be activated in view of the collapse of legitimacy of the formal West-based legal institutions. (ibid.)

This is, of course, Baxi's opinion which does not seem unflawed since these traditional village-based institutions—which are more legendary than living—have long since become the hotbeds of casteism, nepotism and favouritism, and, therefore, not amenable to the principles of justice and fair play.

Besides Baxi, there are two more academic critiques of the Indian legal system that deserve mention here. These are by Vasudha Dhagamwar (1985) and Rajiv Dhavan (1982).

 Dr Vasudha Dhagamwar who like Upendra Baxi is also bitterly critical of the legal system affords corrective solutions by her own example of legal activism. She is an ex-law teacher of the Poona University and is currently a social activist. She has successfully defended the land rights of the tribals of Akkalkua *tehsil* of Dhullia district of Maharashtra state and saved these people from an impossible prospect of having to pay for the second time for the purchase of same pieces of land. Eventually, through her activism, this issue was settled once for all through an amendment in the 9th Schedule of the Indian Constitution9 . The tribal farmers are now free from all further payments and remain owners of their ancestral land (Dhagamwar 1982).

There is yet another book by Vasudha Dhagamwar (2006) with a deep sociological intent. In this book, the author pursues the same theme of tribal dispossession of land. But this time she argues her case with reference to the Bhils in Maharashtra, and the Santals and Pahadiyas in Jharkhand.

Dhagamwar maintains that the image of law depends on the way in which its agents behave, carry out their duties, or perform their role. An important but neglected area of concern is the way India's tribal population perceives the state and its legal mechanisms and structures. In the opinion of her subjects, the legal system is oppressive and exploitative, serving only the rich. She traces the historical roots of their dispossession in (i) the ancient and medieval periods, (ii) their engagement with, and subjugation by, the British, and (iii) their ordeal of disempowerment even after Independence.

Rajiv Dhavan—an ex-law academic, who had worked in the United Kingdom, and now a senior advocate in the Supreme Court of India—has played an important role in preparing the turf for a creative interpretation of law in favour of the poor and the indigent. Reflecting on the poor outcome of the ameliorative efforts launched in favour of the poor and the disadvantaged, he writes:

But there is a vast area of *opportunity entitlements,* which are forgotten as the repression of the disadvantage meanders through the contours of the much-manipulated local state. These are usually treated as a system of discriminatory largesse. These include a large number of areas like land distribution, the right to wages, minimum wages, fair conditions at work, the right not to be discriminated against, the right to positive discrimination in favour of certain cases and classes of cases, the right to food, the right to rations, the right to water, the right to credit, the right to agricultural development and the right to education. Many of these have already been built into governmental legislation. Administrative machinery has been designed to ensure the delivery of those entitlements. A combination of administrative entropy and local manipulation direct and redistribute these entitlements so that they do not reach those for whom they are meant. (1982: 18)

Rajiv Dhavan's emphasis is on two points: one, that there are plenty of provisions for the protection of the disadvantaged people and second, there are ample provisions available for providing them justice under the constitutional mandate; but the administrative set up or the bureaucracy—the way it functions, plus the flawed functioning of the state—prevent the realization of these potentials.

There is yet another study on the legitimacy of the legal order (Gandhi 2004: 137–61), reported rather recently. The study is based upon the subjective responses of some predetermined categories of respondents about the health of the prevailing legal system in the country. The respondents were asked to report, as far as they could recall, their own experiences/encounters with the legal system, and were then encouraged to make opinionated statements. Amongst the respondents were included lawyers, judges, police officials, students, and members of the common citizenry. The investigations were made largely in Delhi, but some respondents were also taken from Amritsar, given the fact that some useful work in this area had already been done by the author in that city. Some broad deductions that emanated from this study are as follows:

- • The most commonly shared perception about the legal system was that it is pathological.
- • Accordingly, the order was perceived as anything but normal. The anger against the system was vehemently expressed by a ninety-two year old citizen in these words: *'There should be a hanging in every public square; criminals should be executed demonstratively*'*.* The younger members referred to countries like China and Saudi Arabia where punishment was severe and expeditious: The respondents wanted the system to be more *repressive* rather than *restitutive*. 9
- • The respondents were of the view that the system is inherited from the British colonialists who were more interested in maintaining their administrative hold over the country than in developing any stable basis for the rule of law and justice-delivery system. Therefore, it needs drastic change so as to meet society's needs—economic, social, and political.
- • The legal system requires to be freed from bureaucratic stranglehold, to facilitate the implementation of an egalitarian agenda as embedded in the Constitution. As of now, the organs of the state—the executive, legislature, and judiciary—are not oriented appropriately to work in the direction of the rights of the citizens and the responsibilities of the state.

# **Studies on Lawyers**

During the period under review, were some studies of note on the legal profession in India. These are concerned with the (a) social background and composition of the legal profession at various levels of court-settings; ( b) conditions and circumstances of professional practice and professional growth; (c) professional hierarchy and the mode and manner of its structuration; (d) conformity, or otherwise, of the professional practice and expected conduct of the lawyers; and (e) lawyers and polity.

In all, five studies will be covered under this review. Needless to say that all the studies mentioned in this section do not pay equal attention to all the areas mentioned above. The studies will be examined according to the order of their publication.

# *Lawyers and Touts: A Study in the Sociology of the Legal Profession (Gandhi 1982)*

Sequentially, J.S. Gandhi's study is first of the full-length studies on the legal profession which appeared in 1982. It was carried out in Gobindgarh in Amritsar district, Punjab. It examined the composition, dynamism, and functioning of the legal profession at the district court of Amritsar. The lawyers in this area are drawn from Jat Sikhs and the business castes of Punjab; the former are predominantly based in rural Punjab whereas the latter are located primarily in urban Punjab. The study brings out that the socio-cultural parameters of the Punjab society which impinge heavily on the legal profession. This is manifest in the way lawyers enter the profession and obtain business and also in the way they work their way up in the professional hierarchy. Accordingly, the social network of the lawyers provides contacts and connections through which they obtain their business. As the data reveals, apart from any other factor the position that a lawyer occupies at the hierarchy can be explained largely in terms of the social network connections that are available to him, especially in the beginning of his career.

The professional work at the district court can be broadly classified as criminal, revenue, and civil practice*.* The structure and composition of the professional hierarchy at the district court is comprised of exclusive lawyers, semi-exclusive lawyers, and non-exclusive lawyers*.* The degree of specialization in professional practice decreases as one goes down from exclusive to non-exclusive type of lawyers. Consequently, the exclusive lawyers practise 'exclusively' in any one of the three practice-areas, i.e. the criminal, revenue, and civil; and the nonexclusive lawyers pursue a mixture of all the three categories of practice, without any particular specialization. The exclusive lawyers, and also some of those in the semi-exclusive category, i.e. those who have both a 'primary' area of practicespecialization as well as a 'secondary' area (e.g. criminal along with revenue or civil along with revenue*)*, have a virtual monopoly over the available legal business at the district court. They also charge high fees. Also, the more specialized the practice the higher is the status enjoyed by the lawyer at the bar.

It emerged that touts or mercenary suppliers—mostly located in lawyers' social networks—play a very important role in supplying business to them in exchange for money11. Not only that, the practice of touting was found to be directly related to the progress of one's career. In other words, the greater the quantum of network connections supplying business to a lawyer, the quicker would be his rise in the profession, and, of course, the greater would be the income. Illustratively, it was found that 11 out of 12 lawyers belonging to the *exclusive* category had their own fathers or close family members in the legal profession or in the police when they entered the profession. It was forcefully stated by the respondents interviewed for the study that 'virtually there is no brief which is passed on to a lawyer without charging the consideration-fee'.

The overall conclusion of the above study is that the legal profession in an Indian district court setting is heavily permeated and guided by particularistic factors, which is contrary to the ideal-typical characterization of professions in the modern society supposedly based upon rationality, functional-specificity, and universalism (Parsons 1954). In other words, the much-celebrated paradigm of professions, which is a construct of the functional sociology, does not hold true for Indian society which continues to be heavily marked by features of *gemeinschaft* as against those of *gesellschaft*.

## *Sociology of Law and the Legal Profession: A Study of Relations Between Lawyers and their Clients*

K.L. Sharma's was the second study of the Indian legal profession to have appeared in 1984. It is an ICSSR-funded study of lawyers practising in the courts of Jaipur. Sharma focusses upon a sample of 140 lawyers. The three largest caste categories to have contributed to this sample are Brahmin (51); Bania-Jain (48); and Kayastha (17). Another significant feature of the sample is that the most apparent specializations of the lawyers studied are civil (38); criminal (30), and revenue (23). This accounts for 65 per cent of the sample.

Unlike Gandhi (1982), Sharma does not distinguish between lawyers' primary and secondary areas of specialization, which is difficult to appreciate since a lawyer engages in any one of the areas exclusively only when he or she is sufficiently high in the bar hierarchy. Another finding of Sharma's suggests that clients approach lawyers directly on the basis of information they gather about them. Sharma says '…that very few lawyers get clients through senior lawyers, touts, trade unions and power elite' (ibid.: 193). This is despite his observation that 'Lawyers have linkage with their clients through many-sided structural channels.' Further, 'Caste linkages between lawyers showed that 71 of 125 clients [interviewed for the study] had lawyers who either hailed form their neighbourhood, village, area, or who belonged to their caste/community, and some of them were also related to each other' (ibid.: 186–95). How is it that these 'structural channels' do not become conduits for supplying business, or are not availed of, or exploited for that purpose? Given the certain minimal continuity between the nature and character of society in Punjab and Rajasthan, the contrast between the mindsets of the clients cannot be so stunningly sharp as to warrant the complete irrelevance of intermediary business connections. However, the explanation may lie in the methodology used, which was primarily a survey-technique employed to interview the clients by investigators.

Sharma, however, makes a useful contribution by affording a sociological understanding of areas such as social stratification among lawyers and clients; network of lawyers and their clients; and the presence or absence of professional continuity between the lawyers and their fathers, grandfathers.

# *'Women Lawyers: A Study in Professionalization' (Sethi 1987)*

Raj Mohini Sethi's study is of women lawyers practising at the Punjab High Court. Out of a total of 290 lawyers, 25 were interviewed for the purpose. 'It makes an attempt to study their role performance and role-relationships in relation to men within the profession". Sethi takes note of the highly restrictive entry of women into the legal profession and links it with the presence of a generalized institutional bias in society.12

# *'Women Lawyers Practising at Delhi Courts: A Sociological Study' (Sheetal Sharma 2002)*<sup>13</sup>

Sheetal Sharma's unpublished study is being examined here for two reasons: **(**i) it is a study in the area of women professionals, which is receiving increasing academic attention on account of a near-euphoric interest currently in women's empowerment; and (ii) unlike the earlier two studies examined above, this study covered legal professionals at all the three levels, viz., District Court, High Court, and the Supreme Court of India. The author found a negligible number of women in the legal profession. The study focussed professionalization, career-making, and patterns of career-success, incidence of role-conflict, i.e. how far their professional demands conflict with their responsibilities towards their families. Some of her major findings are given below:

- • A majority of women lawyers are drawn from well-to-do sections of society. They are comparatively young and are first-generation lawyers in their families. This suggests that entry of women in the profession is a relatively recent phenomenon. The study also found that connections and contacts play an important part in professional promotion.
- • Even though grateful for having joined the profession, women lawyers have to face biases and prejudices vis-à-vis the clients as well as their colleagues. More than one-third of the sample felt that they would never achieve equal status in the profession.
- • One-third of the women lawyers in the sample were satisfied both with their practice as well as with their standing in the profession. At the same time, one-third of them complained of being sexually harassed by their seniors and colleagues.

# *Women, Crime and Law (Nagla 1991)*

B.K. Nagla's book deals with three sub-themes: (i) criminality against women; (ii) criminality among women; and (iii) women in the legal profession.

Two noteworthy conclusions of the study are relevant for citation from the point of sociology of law:

(1) '… neither the Constitution nor the laws has been successful in changing the status of women. They continue to be exploited; as a result they remain dependent upon men, socially, economically and psychologically.'

(2) There is a hopelessly low incidence of women in the legal profession. Nagla attributes this to the patriarchal nature of the Indian society. The author approvingly cites evidence from Chaudhary (1973), Epstein (1982), and Ankalesaria (1985).

Based on the review of the above studies, the following points can be made:

- • The characteristics of the traditional Indian society permeate the Indian legal profession, as, for example, traditional factors such as contacts, connections and traditionally engendered biases such as that of male superiority, and the stereotype that the 'legal profession is meant only for the males'.
- • Further, the spread of professional work is uneven in the profession; that is, seniors monopolize an unusually larger quantum of available work, which gives leverage to those already established in the profession to exploit their juniors.
- • Finally, while the clients are supposed to have autonomy in selecting their counsels, they find it hard to avoid the support of mercenary suppliers (touts).

# **Lawyers, Polity, and Society**

Although the modern legal profession evolved in India only during the period of British occupancy, it played a very crucial role in the Indian history. It is common knowledge that the national movement against British rule was organized and led by some eminent lawyers. A brief account of this is available in a macro-profile of the Indian legal profession in an essay by J. S. Gandhi (1988: 369–82). The essay ends thus:

Because the legal profession emerged during the colonization process, it has no roots in Indian society. It came to be regarded as a means of social mobility, disconnected from traditional society. It grew as a result of the country's economic development and urbanization. It was an important element in the struggle for independence and, thus, became an avenue of socio-political advancement. In the postindependence period, lawyers have pursued power and advantage for themselves and their parties, and have failed to develop a sense of a professionalism that would control deviant practices or promote legal values or the public interest. (379)

# **Women Studies and Studies of Gender Justice**

Nomita Aggarwal Professor of Law at the GGS Indraprastha University, Delhi, in her study (2002), deals primarily with laws and constitutional provisions ( i.e. those inscribed in the Indian Constitution) and their expanding ambit in the succeeding years. While citing the provisions of the Constitution granting equality to women and men, the book carries a lucid commentary on many aspects of the gender justice conceptualized and turned into legal enactments during the five decades of India's history after independence. Laws pertaining to inheritance, labour, human rights, prevention of violence, representation of women in the media, and several particular matters are shown to have relevance to contemporary lives. Most remarkably, it draws attention not only to the rubrics of laws important for women but also speaks of the role society and its institutions can play in promoting access to law. This book is includes in the review because, unlike many offers by the law specialists, this does not merely catalogue the laws but also relates them to the changing social context.

## *Gender Studies with Sociology of Law Perspective*

Among the gender studies on the Indian society, the theme of male domination is a repetitive strain. Yet Kalpana Kannabiran's studies have a rare sociological depth and are worthy of emulation. With rare analytical innovation and conceptual improvisation, she has pursued various issues such as violence against women including rape (2005); gendered nature of justice (1996: 2223–25); modesty; honour; and power (Kannabiran and Kannabiran 2002).

In all her studies of the same genre she employs remarkable sociological insight while addressing herself to problems concerning the plight of women not only in the day-to-day and wider social life but also within various sanctified legal institutions such as the judiciary, the Constitution, and the rule of law as widely understood.

# **Studies of Court Culture**

If one were to visit any district court setting in India, one would easily identify the various role-categories that function in mutual synchrony in the delivery of justice. The reference here is not necessarily to 'justice' in the ideal-typical or professionally appropriate sense, i.e. how justice ought to be dispensed. Instead, it refers to its processual aspect, i.e. how a seeker of 'justice', after he or she approaches a court setting with a certain case (grouse*,* complaint, or whatever) against an adversary, is treated by a variety of individuals representing various formal or informal roles in the course of court proceedings. The whole framework of personnel acting and interacting vis-à-vis each other may be recognized theoretically as a symbolic interactional setting*.* That all this is part and parcel of the known court-reality or judicial process is beyond any doubt, but sociologists have rarely engaged in this area of study in India.14

There is only one study available for review, J.S. Gandhi's (2004: 55–68) 'Goffmanian Perspective on Criminal Justice: A View from District Court Setting'. It is an observational study based on direct observations made in a criminal court during July 1986. The various role-personnel studied in their mutual interaction included clients, magistrates, reader, the court/magistrate's steno, court peon, lawyers, lawyers' *munshi*, police personnel (ASI), APP (Assistant Prosecution Officer), and SPP (Senior Prosecuting Officer)*.*

The mode of analysis adopted is symbolic interactionist or Goffmanian dramaturgy (see Goffman 1974b), which focusses on the processes involved in face-to-face interaction between the actors in everyday life. As one enters a criminal court in session in an Indian district court, one notices overt and covert interactions between the personnel identified above. The observations were made15 both when the courts were in session and also when either they had adjourned or were getting ready for the proceedings. The study led to the following inferences:

- • There is a common attitude of unconcern on the part of all the participants towards the accused, the procedure and the process of criminal litigation, and consequently the nature and quality of criminal justice.
- • First of all, lawyers look upon the criminal litigant as a usable and expendable source, fit only for the generation of pecuniary benefits. They collude apparently and clearly with the court staff to get postponements.
- • For the court staff, the accused is nothing but cash cow cattle to be bled white through a variety of extortions all through the progress of a case, for a variety of real or imaginary services rendered. The court officials were also found to be creating unreal fears in the minds of the accused and those accompanying them, as to the direction a case was likely to take in the court for the sake of extracting money.
- • The study also brings out the attitude of bureaucratic neglect on the part of the 'prosecution' limb of the criminal justice system, which seems to, go on somewhat like an over-fed machine on the verge of collapse. For prosecuting officials, criminal cases constitute an avoidable strain and burden, and hence they do barely enough to keep their jobs. Much of their energy is employed in socializing. There are also suggestions that some criminal cases are killed on account of collusion and complicity between the police and prosecution in the interest of the accused.

Therefore, with all these overt and covert complicities, meet the ends of criminal justice—which is indeed the responsibility the legal system owes to society—is hardly possible and the quality of criminal justice is thus, pulled down to its lowest level.

• Virtually all the professional role-categories (i.e. lawyers, lawyer-prosecutors, and judges) as well as the bureaucratic paraphernalia of the court system engaged in dispensing criminal justice hold mutual antipathies and hostile stereotypes. But all the same, through their attitude of neglect, apathy, and self-gratification, they all seem to be working towards the same end: the neglect and denial of criminal justice.

The study shows that both the directly observable court reality and also the method of study adopted in the preceding, i.e. *Goffmanian Dramaturgy*16 are very effective in mapping important frontiers located between the law and society. More such court room studies need to be carried out.

# **Social Background of Supreme Court Judges**

Indian society is not only a caste-based society, it is also generally perceived as being a *casteist* society where the distribution of socio-economic and political resources is guided by the 'caste' factor, implying thereby that the castes that are higher up in the hierarchy and also politically and economically dominant wield a relatively stronger influence on certain crucial socio-political decisions in society. If the said assumption sustains, then it should also reflect in the functioning of the country's judicial system.

An interesting study (Sriram 2001), which was submitted to the College of Arts and Sciences Georgia State University, chose to put this hypothesis to the test. The author chose to examine the presence of caste-bias in the formation of benches (of judges) drawn from non-Brahmin castes. The study was based on the probability analysis of panel assignments of cases from 1950 to 2000. It is important to mention that the study discovered no caste-bias, either in the 50-year period of the court or in a smaller data set of cases between 1977 and 2000 (the period after the Emergency between 1975 and 1977). The findings are indeed very significant since they reflect the robust health of the judiciary, despite a profusion of evidence that caste-politics has vitiated the polity and also the functioning of various other institutions in society.

# **The Emergent Legal Culture in India: The Rise of Public Interest Litigation [PIL]**

Traditionally perceived to be a *status quoist* society steeped in caste, superstitions, and religion, India has witnessed a revolution in the domain of law in the form of public interest litigation.

# *What is Public Interest Litigation?*

In perhaps the earliest academic treatment of the subject, S.K. Agrawala's *Public Interest Litigation in India: A Critique* affords a systematic and also a contextual treatment of the subject. But here also the reference is to the way the pioneer judge—Justice P.N. Bhagwati—defines this phenomenon rather than to any logico-conceptual construction:

[W]here a legal wrong or a legal injury is caused to a person or to a determinate class of persons by reason of violation of any constitutional or legal right or any burden is imposed in contravention of any constitutional or legal provision or without authority of law or any such legal wrong or legal injury or legal burden is threatened and such person or determinate class of persons is by reasons of poverty, helplessness or disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position, unable to approach the court for relief, any member of the public can maintain an application for appropriate direction, order or writ in the High Court under Article 226 and in case of breach of any fundamental right of such person or determinate class of persons, in this Court under Article 32 seeking judicial redress for the legal wrong or injury caused to such person or determinate class of persons.

In yet another judgment, he observes:

…the Court is moved for this purpose by a member of a public by addressing a letter drawing the attention of the Court to such legal injury or legal wrong. Court would cast aside all technical rules of procedure and entertain the letter as a writ petition on the judicial side and take action upon it.

However, Justice Krishna Iyer—in the famous case, Mumbai Kamgar Sabha vs. Abdulbhai in 1976—had already made a signal beginning in the domain of public interest litigation without using the formal nomenclature of PIL. The following is a brief quote from Justice Iyer's judgment:

Test litigation, representative actions, *pro bono publico* and like broadened forms of legal proceedings are in keeping with the current accent on Justice to the common man and a disincentive to those who wish to bypass the real issues on the merits by suspect reliance on peripheral, procedural shortcomings …. Public interest is promoted by a spacious construction of *locus standi* in our socio-economic circumstances and conceptual latitudinarianism permits taking liberties with individualization of the right to invoke the higher courts where the remedy is shared by a considerable number, particularly when

#### 578 Joginder s. gandhi

they are weaker. Less litigation, consistent with fair process, is the aim of adjective law ....

Yet another treatment of this emerging trend is available in 'Phenomenology of Emergent Culture: The case of Indian Lawyers and the Legal System' (Gandhi 1987a: 138–62). This article goes into the socio-political genesis of the emergent culture of public interest litigation, citing Upendra Baxi's description in approval:

India has witnessed its first real upsurge of legal activists (including even among justices of the Supreme Court) only in the last four years. This can be explained by the catharsis of middle and upper middle classes and their slight radicalization, in the wake of and upon the cessation of the internal emergency in 1977 and the tumultuous populism of the Janata years and the return of Indira Gandhi. (1982b: 12)

Sociologically speaking, the main intent and purpose of PIL is to whittle down structurally engendered inequalities through legal and juristic improvisations, which is quite obvious from the rather activist posture held by the judiciary on certain cases.17 This means that by a loud admission of the existing cleavage between the advantaged and the disadvantaged sections of society, the PIL tends to whittle down the existing inequalities of means and opportunities in society by clearing the procedural roadblocks for the delivery of justice to the disadvantaged sections.

## *Lawyers and Public Interest Litigation (Gandhi 2004: 79–84)*<sup>18</sup>

Besides academics, there are also some practising lawyers who are strongly committed to this non-conventional type of litigation. They work within the framework of some institutional nexus—ranging from a husband-wife dyad (e.g. Nirmal Hingorani and Kapila Hingorani practising in the Supreme Court of India) to one or more lawyers working collaboratively, attached to an ideologically committed platform which may be constituted of either the lawyers themselves—such as the Lawyers' Collective of Bombay (which is expressly committed to the ideology of communism)—or a Civil Liberties forum—such as the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), or People's Union for Democratic Rights (PUDR). The latter type of institutions includes not merely the lawyers but also some other publicspirited persons, and even members of the teaching profession, and journalists.

The institutional dynamics of these, or other organizational forms, is yet to be studied, but the orientation and concern of lawyers working with them is clear enough. It has a three-fold dimension. First, all these are highly critical and perceptive of the way the entire legal system, including the judiciary, works to the disfavour of the disadvantaged; second, they are also conscious of the egalitarian potential of the Constitution and the various laws that have been formulated in pursuance of these objectives; and third, they litigate on behalf of the poor for various inequities suffered by them in violation of their fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. Seeking through the courts the remedy against a specific wrong suffered by them, they are seeking the restoration of the fundamental rights. For example, in the now famous case of the Bombay pavement dwellers, who were sought to be evicted by the municipal authorities from the pavements they had occupied for a long time and used as a nodal point for earning their livelihood, both the PUCL and the Lawyers' Collective of Mumbai, defended their right to stay on the pavement as a remedy against a possible infringement of their fundamental right to earn their livelihood through a threatened eviction by the authorities. Hence, they argued that they could not be displaced from there without being provided a viable and a composite alternative, which implies this dual facility of dwelling and earning in mutual proximity. Of course, the subsequent judgment of the Supreme Court did not regard this as a tenable argument and ordered these dwellers to vacate the pavements, since otherwise the rights of the pavement walkers would have to be compromised. But even so, the Lawyers' Collective had made its point rather strongly and within the juridical parameters.

It is very interesting to see that the position taken by two groups on the same case showed subtle ideological variations, notwithstanding the fact that both may have been imbued with the zeal to do some good for the affected people. Note, for example, what Indira Jaising had to say about the position taken on the case of dwellers by another action group PUCL—through their representative lawyer, Ashok Desai: 'He did a great damage to the case of the pavement dwellers by conceding in the court that even though these people should be provided alternative dwellings, they in fact had no right under the Constitution to occupy the pavements… whereas our position has been totally opposed to it, i.e. their eviction would mean infringement of their fundamental rights.'19

Another member of the Collective put this positional difference between the two groups in clearer ideological perspective: 'In clear terms we argue such cases from the standpoint of the proletarian class, whereas groups like PUCL maintain a middle class posture… For example, we have been maintaining that before they are evicted, they must be provided with an alternative accommodation, whereas the PUCL makes no such insistence.'

Besides their manifest ideological differences, there are probably more differences between groups like the Collective, PUCL or PUDR. However, the current ideological positions of these two organizations also need to be explored.

Lawyers working with the forums like PUCL and PUDR, when interviewed in the mid-1980s, maintained a rather free-floating position with regard to their professional practice. They said they choose to work on cases they feel seized with, and unlike the members of the Collective who have a 'joint' or a 'shared' practice in the larger sense of the term, pursue their individual practices in the way they want. They also do not make a fetish of excluding certain categories of legal business. For example, the members of the 'Collective' did declare that they never take the case of an employer against his employee or even that of a husband against an aggrieved wife. Against this, the late V.M. Tarkunde, President of the PUCL and the late Gobinda Mukhoty of the PUDR (both of whom had worked as 'senior' counsels at Supreme Court) were quite candid in admitting that they did not personally declare certain cases out of bounds for themselves, even though with the kind of professional reputation they had enjoyed, an employer would feel discouraged from engaging them. As Mukhoty said, 'Having known my strong socialist and Marxist views, and the kind of arguments I make in defending the aggrieved employees in a court of law, any employer would think several times before coming to me… even then, I must say that I do not make a fetish of excluding certain cases' (quoted in Gandhi 1987: 138–62).

V.M. Tarkunde's argument was similar while defending the Children Society of Bombay vs. a known social activist of Bombay, Sheela Barse. As Tarkunde alleged '…She (i.e. Barse) is making all kinds of accusations against the Society that it is misusing the funds granted to it by the state and depriving children…I don't feel apologetic that I am representing this Society against a section of children who are alleged to be ill-treated. Among many points to be considered in this case is, whether the children's interests will not be adversely affected if the Society were to be denied all financial help' (ibid.: 150–57).

The relatively more intellectual among the practising lawyers who have taken to public interest litigation realize the necessity of this litigation on account of two fundamental reasons. Firstly, there is a lag or continuing chasm between the promise of equalitarianism and egalitarianism as enshrined in the Constitution (e.g. through Directive Principles of the State Policy exhorting the State to move towards granting to the individuals 'right to work', 'education for all', `public assistance to the indigent persons', 'equal pay for equal work') on the one hand, and the reality of the day-to-day situation in the country on the other. Gobinda Mukhoty20, has instanced some glaring violations of the fundamental rights as follows:

*Report in the Guardian*, UK, 1979: India having per capita income of Rs. 120 per month was almost at the bottom of the list (in comparison Kuwait has Rs. 12,500 per capita income per month).21

*A news item on April 28, 1981*: Kamla, part of humanity's flotsam, rejected by her brothers and in-laws was sold at last for Rs. 2300 in flesh market of Madhya Pradesh, situated opposite the circuit house.

*November 3, 1982*: India has 7 million bonded labourers, a Report of the anti-slavery society submitted to U.N. Working Group.

According to the recent Planning Commission Report, nearly 240 million people live below poverty line.

Secondly, the intellectual lawyers are acutely conscious of the point that despite the fact that the Indian State has formally conceded certain fundamental 'human rights' to its wider citizenry in pursuance of the United Nations Charter of Human Rights of 1984, these rights have quite often been breached. Illustrating several instances taken both from Congress I-led as well as Janata Party-led governments at the Centre, Mukhoty cites several instanced of the flagrant violations of rights. Some of these as listed by him are as follows:

| 17–3–1980  | A procession of blind people waiting to go to the<br>Prime Minister's house was brutally lathi-charged by<br>the police. |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 15–6–1980  | Police killings that shook a village.                                                                                    |
| 26–6–1980  | Woman paraded naked, then raped by police.                                                                               |
| 24–8–1980  | 3,000 times a police witness.                                                                                            |
| 22–11–1980 | Bihar 'Final' solution for Crime: Blind undertrial.                                                                      |
| 27–11–1980 | Eyes punctured twice to ensure total blindness.                                                                          |
| 27–9–1981  | Lucknow: the tribals mainly live on leaves for three to<br>four months a year.                                           |
| 17–12–1981 | Convicts turned into mental cases due to torture.                                                                        |
| 7–3–1983   | Nothing to eat but poisonous weeds.                                                                                      |

#### *Law Columnists and Public Interest Litigation*

Justice P.N. Bhagwati (1985: 561–76; Gandhi 1987: 138–62) once remarked, 'There is …a misplaced self-celebration on the part of the higher Judiciary that a revolution of public interest litigation is afoot, and it is primarily of their exclusive making. The Supreme Court, through public interest litigation has found a new basis for the Legitimation of judicial power and has acquired a new credibility with the people. This development has been the result of intense social activism on the part of some of the justices of Supreme Court of India'.22 Some law columnists writing for the national dailies such as *The Times of India*, *The Hindustan Times*, and *The Statesman* have also played a prominent role in the promotion of public interest litigation in the period under review. They have done this by a strident critique of the Indian legal system—both in general terms and also by critiquing some of its practices and procedures. Some of these columnists are Krishan Mahajan (*The Hindustan Times*); S. Sahay (*The Statesman*); and J. Anthony (*The Times of India).* These perceptive observers of the law scene in India, between them, have left hardly any flaw or blemish of the contemporary Indian legal system unexposed.

They have criticized the procedure as well as the substantive law; the government's handling of the judiciary; judiciary's manner of interpreting the Constitution—the continuity or discontinuity between the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles, the functioning and formation of Supreme Court benches and the question of discrepancy in judgments passed by different benches on similar cases; the judges' improper handling of their bureaucratic staff; the inadequate sharing of the information about the Supreme Court judgments not only among the various benches but also with various High Courts, resulting in several serious errors of judgments (Gandhi 1987: 157).

Perhaps the most prolific among these journalists is Krishan Mahajan who deliberated on all such and related issues in his well-known weekly column 'Legal Perspectives', which he continued to use for a strident critique of the legal system till he started his own practice about 10 years ago.

#### *Ecology-Related Public Interest Litigation*

As it has increasingly come to the notice of one and all, ecology or environment is the frequent loser in the process of economic development and modernization. Both the judiciary and several public-spirited bodies in India, as elsewhere in the world, have mounted relevant and effective legal initiatives to stem this danger to public health, and to society in general.

Most of the litigation under this category has been shaped by individual lawyers, some of whom have also gone on to form organizations around their efforts and activities. M.C. Mehta is one such person who runs the M.C. Mehta Environmental Foundation, New Delhi.23 Mehta is an attorney in the Supreme Court of India, and is a well-known and effective environmental lawyer. He is one of the founders of the Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action (ICELA). His landmark environmental cases in the Supreme Court of India have resulted in the protection of India's natural and cultural treasures, including the Ganges river and the Taj Mahal, from the adverse effects of pollution. In addition, Mehta played a key role in persuading India's Supreme Court to rule that Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees each citizen the 'right to life', necessarily includes the 'right to a healthy environment'. The implications of this ruling are far-reaching: Each Indian citizen now has the right to seek enforcement of India's environmental laws by filing a writ petition to the Supreme Court of India, or a State High Court. Mehta has collaborated with the e-Law network since 1991.

Besides judges and some public-spirited lawyers, some law academics and newspaper columnists have also played an important role in promoting public interest litigation by highlighting certain important public issues.

# *Ecology, PIL, and Creative Expansion of the Constitutional Provisions*

The Supreme Court of India, while passing judgments on several public interest petitions, has also expanded the scope of some provisions of the Constitution thereby outlining certain new fundamental rights for the citizens of the country. This has been done in order to accommodate the genuine demands of the petitioners—as warranted by the very spirit of the democratic Constitution. All this has happened because of the legitimacy accorded by the Supreme Court to departures from the traditional rule of *locus standi.* Some such creative interpretations by the Indian Supreme Court are listed below:

A. The Court's power to grant compensation under Article 32: 'Under Article 32 Jurisdiction and power of the Court is not only injunctive in ambit, i.e. preventing the infringement of a fundamental right, but it is also remedial in scope. . . The power to grant such remedial relief may include the power to award compensation in appropriate cases.'

B. Article 21: Scope and ambit expanded to include right to a clean and healthy environment in the right to life.

C. Law of Torts: Strict and absolute liability of an enterprise engaged in a hazardous and inherently dangerous processes.

The rule in *Rylands v. Fletcher—*evolved at a time when all these developments of science and technology had not taken place—cannot afford any guidance consistent with—constitutional norms of the present-day economy and social structure.

D. The 'Polluter Pays Principle', 'Precautionary Principle' and 'Public Trust Doctrine' have become an integral part of the environmental law and policy in India.

E. The maintainability of public interest litigation: Letters addressed to individual judges are entertainable. Hyper-technical approach to be avoided by this Court. Court must look at the substance and not the form.

F. Location of hazardous industry: National policy should evolve for the location of chemical and other hazardous industries in areas

#### 584 Joginder s. gandhi

where population is scarce. There should preferably be a green belt of 1 to 5 km width around such hazardous industries.

G. Jurisprudence and law to keep pace with the changing socio-economic norms. Where a law does not fit into the present context, Court should evolve new law.

H. Environmental courts: 'Since cases involving issues of environmental pollution, ecological destruction and conflicts over natural resources are increasingly coming up for adjudication and these cases involve assessment and evolution of scientific and technical data, it might be desirable to set up special Environment Courts.' On the Supreme Court direction some of the High Courts in India have set up Green Benchs to hear environment cases. The Supreme Court directed the Government of India to set up authorities under the Environment Protection Act to enforce orders and to further issue directions for the protection of the environment and control of pollution.

The traditional perspectives of law, legal system, judiciary, and the legal profession are that all these are status quoist in nature, intent, and application. This can also be appreciated sociologically because the very purpose of law as an institution or a substructure is to promote and nurture continuity in societal norms, processes, and behavioural practices and thereby promote predictability in social behaviour. This is a position which follows from all definitions of social structure and culture.

At the same time, society is a living organism, which continues to be impacted by forces of change—both endogenous and exogenous, causing not merely change but even transformation. This can be seen in the form of the newly developed, now quite resilient, culture of public interest litigation, which tends to confront some of the age-old principles of law such as that of *locus standi*. However, quite often it seems difficult to balance the two forces, i.e. the one represented by the status quoist institutional apparatus of law with the newly generated dynamism represented by the emergent practice of public interest litigation*.*

Thus, despite the salutary effects of PIL on the common people, some of its pitfalls have also come to the fore. Quite often frivolous cases are filed in the Supreme Court, especially because it is possible to do so at a negligible cost. It is thought that many of the activists in the country have found the PIL as a handy tool of harassment. Using PIL, petitioners negotiate with the other party for their personal gain, rather than to serve a public cause for which PILs were meant. The lowering of the *locus standi* requirement has permitted privately motivated interests to pose as public interests. Thus, abuse of PIL has become rampant. Genuine causes have either receded to the background or begun to be viewed with suspicion. In any case, PIL now does require a complete rethink and restructuring (Vadievel 2003).This also offers a good scope for sociological research.

In the landmark case of Raunaq International Limited v/s IVR Construction Ltd., Justice Sujata V. Manohar rightly enunciated that when a stay order is obtained at the instance of a private party, or even at the instance of a body litigating in public interest, any interim order which stops the project from proceeding further must provide for the reimbursement of costs to the public in case, ultimately, the litigation started by such an individual or body fails. In other words, the public must be compensated both for the delay in the implementation of the project and for the cost escalation resulting from such a delay. Though this comes as a valuable corrective to the otherwise chaotic possibility of overburdening the legal system, such a move by the judiciary has not been taken very kindly in some intellectual and professional circles. See the following quote:

Public Interest Litigants, all over the country, have not taken very kindly to such court decisions. They do fear that this will sound the death-knell of the people friendly concept of PIL. However, *bona fide* litigants of India have nothing to fear. Only those PIL activists who prefer to file frivolous complaints will have to pay compensation to the opposite parties, whose interests may be affected by delaying the progress of the cases which have to be postponed in order to give priority to a public interest petition. It is actually a welcome move because no one in the country can deny that even PIL activists should be responsible and accountable. It is also notable here that even the Consumers Protection Act, 1986 has been amended to provide compensation to opposite parties in cases of frivolous complaints made by consumers. In any way, PIL now does require a complete rethink and restructuring. Anyway, overuse and abuse of PIL can only make it stale and ineffective. Since it is an extraordinary remedy available at a cheaper cost to all citizens of the country, it ought not to be used by all litigants as a substitute for ordinary ones or as a means to file frivolous complaints.(Vadievel 2003)

#### *PIL and the Judicial Selectivity*

There is yet another critique of the PIL available, though only in small measure, i.e. in the way judiciary implements it or applies it, the central argument being that the facilitations available under the PIL are sought to be applied by the judiciary not uniformly but arbitrarily, and with a touch of selectivity (Baxi 2004).

#### *Public Interest Litigation: A Case of Intra-Structural Contradiction*

It is very easy to imagine that the forces of status quo and judicial activism, as represented by the public interest litigation, cannot balance out against each other, and that both the liberalistic legal ethos (PIL) and the propensity to perpetuate (status quo), will continue to be at logger heads.

The legal System, as well as the social system will increasingly find it difficult to absorb this new compulsion as they gather more and more momentum. Also, their translation into reality is directly dependent on the attitude and goodwill of the bureaucracy at all levels, which often lies in servitude and subjection to the political elites from the high classes and castes and cannot be so easily commandeered by the rulings from the judiciary. [But] the fact remains that no normative compulsions *de novo* can be imposed upon the unwilling yet privileged citizenry, especially in a democratic framework. Building of social consensus, however slow, should, therefore, be pursued simultaneously to ensure the eventual success of such a revolution—which is professional, legal and social at the same time.24

There is a very incisive critique of the way PIL is being practised in a rather halfhearted manner by the apex judges who are more verbose than substantive in their efforts. The case in point here is of a law columnist, Krishan Mahajan, who has been a fearless campaigner for the rights of the underdogs. Note the following:

…It is tragic that no attention has been paid by legal aid and social work agencies to capture political power by creating voting banks of those for whose benefits they proclaim themselves to be working (1984a).

Or

...The problem is that Marxist social work agencies do not believe in the law or even its use as a strategic input. This proceeds on a vulgarized concept of Marxism that describes law as a part of the superstructure. They forget that Law also can be seized like a gun from the 'enemy' for use against the enemy itself (1984b).

Krishan Mahajan also stresses that PIL is 'doomed to be a middle class concept. This is so because the middle class-drawn judges, middle class professionals inclusive of lawyers, both within and outside various social action agencies, and also the middle bureaucracy in the courts never realize the necessity of disseminating information about the various laws and judgments among the poor people'(Gandhi 1987: 159).

# *Civil Society, PIL and the State*

The PIL is a very powerful operational contrivance in the hands of both the public and the judiciary to monitor as well as set right the grave public wrongs resulting from improper use of the power prescribed by the formal institutional limits. The objective of such actions under the PIL is to broaden the limits of the public sphere as narrowly defined by the rule of law.

An interesting study of these relationships is available in Hans Dembowski's (2006) book, *Taking the State to Court: Public Interest Litigation and the Public Sphere in Metropolitan India.*<sup>25</sup> The author studies two environmental PILs the in the Calcutta High Court. This is what he has to say about his book:

This is an essay in the sociology of governance. It deals with the division of power between the administrative and judicial branches of government and their interaction with society as a whole in the particular case of one mega-city in a developing country. At the core of my work is the scrutiny of two major cases of environmental litigation in the urban agglomeration of Calcutta. The findings are, nevertheless, relevant in a larger context than just the local polity concerned. The ongoing, excited media debate about public interest litigation and judicial activism makes this evident. These terms stand for judicial interference in the policies and administrative activities of elected governments. This phenomenon has recently become typical of India. Its effect on governance deserves some systematic sociological scrutiny. Accordingly, this book deals with the notions of 'good governance', 'civil society', 'public sphere' and related issues concerning the relationship between state and society, and specifically the viability of representative democracy. The question debated in current development studies is whether such value-based concepts can be applied to developing countries. As far as my empirical data show, they make sense in Calcutta—a finding that is, of course, relevant for the Indian polity as a whole. Calcutta, the State capital of West Bengal is the centre of India's second largest urban agglomeration….

Public interest litigation (in which agents of civil society sue the government) does permit some access to the wielders of state power and, accordingly, a minimum level of scrutiny of their doings. Courtrooms can, thus, become the location of a rudimentary 'public sphere', defined here as the arena in which civil society and state interact in a rational, critical and rule-bound rather than merely hierarchical discourse. The judiciary is inspiring hope for better governance, but it does not yet warrant trust in the administration. The courts provide for a [forum] where claims against the state are staked. However, they do so with some serious handicaps. Most notably, they are themselves bedevilled by non-transparency, inefficiency and corruption. This is not surprising as the judiciary is one branch of the very government structure that is malfunctioning. However, the strong institutional

#### 588 Joginder s. gandhi

autonomy of the courts gives judges room for manoeuvre—and considerable scope to enhance the public sphere.

My findings in Calcutta suggest that government shortcomings in this specific urban context are not best explained as results of a segmented, semi-feudal society, unready for a liberal constitution. Rather, it is the institutional framework of a quasi-authoritarian, postcolonial administration that does not allow the participation of an assertive civil society in policy matters. If Indian democracy is to be strengthened state agencies will have to become responsible and cooperative actors in the public sphere. (7–9)

These are very useful observations. As one can to discern, Dembowski's analysis, based upon the empirical data he collected, enables him to make some perceptive comments on the judiciary, polity, and the civil society and their mutual relationship via the public interest litigation. More such studies would be welcome.

#### *Sociology of Law: Its Praxis, Reach, and Relevance*

As independent India started facing travails of self-governance and self-management with the adoption of a democratic format, particularly in the face of huge socio-cultural diversities, a number of political and administrative endeavours to manage the polity and the legal system surfaced through a variety of innovations and improvisations such as the adoption of the reservation policy, initiation of free legal aid, and the PIL. This was necessary in view of the traditionally inherited inequities in the form of the caste system and several other discriminations, which came into direct clash with the basic parameters of the secular-egalitariandemocratic order that India embraced.

This has also been manifested in approximately 93 amendments in the Indian Constitution since its inception in nearly all the three domains of the state-polity, i.e. executive, legislature, and judiciary (Gandhi 2004: 97–110). That, so many amendments had to be carried out in order to address certain emergent administrative-socio-political problems not visualized at the time of the inception of the Constitution signifies a creative and incremental bond that obtains between the social structure on the one hand and the evolving institutional instrumentalities, on the other. Now when sociological sensitivity is permeating richly into media outputs, discussions, and deliberations on the functioning of the civil society as well on issues of socio-political governance, sociology of law is poised to take big strides into the real world. Especially through the coming into being of various national law schools recently in the country, with the teaching of sociology as a necessary component, the discipline of sociology of law is bound to acquire a clearer delineation and a sharper focus in the study of modern legal institutions.

It is important to realize, however, that mere commentaries on ancient scriptures, or observations on the present legal system, cannot elevate the status of this sub-speciality to the level of an independent discipline. There is need for empirical research on the various aspects and processes of law. Of course, criminology handles some of them. But there are other areas such as awareness of legal rights and provisions, legal aid to the poor, the profession of lawyers, the judges, and even detailed case studies of individual cases pending in the courts for a long time that afford good opportunities for research.

The area of public interest litigation is of particular importance. The criticism of PIL was noted here in terms of its likely misuse by interested parties serving their latent agenda and suppressing the putative and manifest objectives of PIL as a useful instrumentality. But the criticisms could be as superficial as their rebuttals. However, even when there is a likely prospect of PIL being misused, it cannot, and need not, be barred because of its sheer vitality for nurturing a democratic and humanitarian ethos. It makes sense to argue, therefore, that the use of PIL should be regulated, preferably with the additional support and involvement of some activist members of NGOs, the media, intelligentsia, and the judiciary.

Another area in which there is scope for research relates to human rights. It may be noted that human rights was included by UNESCO in its Sector for Social and Human Sciences. Assigned the task of promoting work in this area, Yogesh Atal, who served as UNESCO's Regional Adviser for Social and Human Sciences in Asia and the Pacific, conveyed his 'feeling of distrust while treating human rights as a social science speciality'. He found that in the region of Asia and the Pacific, this subject 'remained confined to university departments of Law—particularly international Law, and of Political Science.' He writes:

The question was of orientation. How to approach the subject? What questions to ask? How to go beyond macro statistics to empirical research? No departments other than those of Political Science and Law ever showed any interest in human rights. (Atal 2005: vii)

#### He further says:

Social sciences would have to develop a paradigm to handle the issue of human rights if they really wished to go beyond 'journalistic' reportage or 'political' commentaries. If social scientists as social scientists dealt human rights in the same manner as NGO leaders or politicians, or social activists, they might promote the cause of human rights but would not strengthen the case of the social sciences. (ibid.: viii)

The above comment applies equally to other aspects of law. Given the present state of the development of sociology of law in India, it will be advisable to constitute a special committee under the auspices of the ICSSR to develop a suitable paradigm, train young social scientists in methodology relevant for the study of this terrain, and also develop a priority agenda for research. Certainly PIL and human rights offer two good areas for research of societal and sociological significance.

The implementation of these suggestions can easily facilitate the emergence of Sociology of Law as a distinct speciality of the discipline. And, since the Indian polity is passing through challenges of misuse and legitimacy from all varieties of socio-ethnic combines and interest groupings, including those from the business lobbies, the crucible is just about mature and ready to generate useful academic impulses for the emergence of the sociology of law. Much of the impetus for this phenomenon, one may surmise at this stage, would also come from the growing vibrancy of the *civil society culture* through the efforts of non-government organizations.
