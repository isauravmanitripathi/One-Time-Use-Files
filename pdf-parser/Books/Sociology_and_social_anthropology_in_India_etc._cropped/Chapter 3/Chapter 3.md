## RuRal and agRaRian StudieS

#### Surinder S. Jodhka and Paul D'Souza

## **Introduction: Historical Background**

'Rural society' and 'agrarian change' have been rather fluid areas of research in Indian social science. Besides sociologists and social anthropologists, valuable studies on rural India have also been produced by economists, historians, public administration specialists and political scientists. Diverse disciplinary orientations and use of different conceptual frameworks and research techniques have enriched the studies on rural India and agrarian change. For example, many of the social anthropologists who carried out 'village studies' during the decades of 1950s and 1960s were influenced by the British tradition of social anthropology (Atal 2003; Béteille 1975; Chauhan 1974). These scholars confined their fieldwork mostly to a single village, and used mainly the method of participant observation. Their interest was to understand and document the structure of the 'traditional' Indian village society (see Atal, 2003; Breman 1997; Jodhka 1998). Their effort was to provide a 'field-view' of the village, in contrast to the 'bookview' that had been popularized by the Indologists. The economists, on the other hand, mostly used survey method and focused on documenting the processes of social and economic change being experienced in micro settings, usually covering more than one village.

Similarly, while the sociologists and social anthropologists emphasized the reciprocity of caste-ties and the vertical integrity of the rural community, the economists looked at the economic side of agriculture. Some of them also examined in great detail the social framework of agricultural production and distribution, and the implications that some of the 'older' structures could have for the policies of development and change being pursued by the 'independent' Indian State. Unlike the sociologists and social anthropologists who were preoccupied with categories of *caste* and *community* in their analysis of the rural and agrarian social structures, economists were more comfortable with the category of *class*. Even those who worked with neoclassical or liberal frameworks frequently used land ownership and acreage classification in their analysis of the rural economy. This enabled them to raise questions of power and domination in the village society much more easily than was the case with social anthropologists who looked at village with functionalist notion of community.

The influence of 'peasant studies' that came to India during the post-War period through the writings of scholars like Robert Redfield did not see rural populations as being differentiated. Even when hierarchy was seen as one of the defining features of caste, questions of power and domination were rarely seen as being intrinsic to such relations. For example, when Srinivas used the concept of 'Dominant Caste' he conceptualized dominance as an attribute of a caste group, rather than a social relationship. Nowhere did he explicitly talk about the relational other of the dominant caste, i.e. the 'subordinate castes', or their likely attributes.

Unlike the social anthropologists, economists in India were also generally more concerned with issues of agrarian change. Their involvement with the process of planning for development during the early decades of independence made a certain degree of familiarity with agrarian economy essential for them. From Land Reforms to the Green Revolution, agriculture had been central to the developmental initiatives of the Indian State. In order to identify the hurdles that mired the process of economic development, they had to go beyond economics. They looked at the institutional and social frameworks of Indian agriculture and suggested ways and means of changing them.

Some sociologists and social anthropologists too focused on 'change' and under took studies in order to make sense of the nature of the social transformation taking place with development planning. Some of them were also involved with evaluating the different projects and schemes that were launched by the government of independent India. For example, they were closely associated with the Community Development Programme (CDP) right from its early days (see Alexander 2000; Dhanagare 1993). Over the years 'rural development' emerged as a distinct area of interdisciplinary research. Sociologists and social anthropologists have been important contributors to its growth. Though the meaning of 'rural development' has been undergoing some changes, it has acquired a distinct identity of its own.

Apart from the tradition of 'village studies', 'agrarian studies' and 'rural develop ment', there have also been other inputs to what is broadly the scope of this review. 'Peasant studies' and 'rural sociology' are, for example, other important areas of study which have overlapped with what is being discussed here.

Further, the presence of diverse specializations focusing on the 'rural' and/or the 'agrarian' is not the only source of fluidity and complexity that one encounters while doing such a survey. Village in India has also been the most popular signifier of the native life. As Andre Beteille has rightly pointed out, 'the village was not merely a place where people lived; it had a design in which were reflected the basic values of Indian civilization' (Béteille 1980:108). The colonial administrators had presented India to the outside world as a land of village republics (see Cohn 1987; Inden 1990). The leading ideologues of India's freedom movement similarly imagined the 'real' or authentic India to be residing in its villages. Though they disagreed on the value of rural living, leaders like Gandhi, Nehru, and Ambedkar contested the notion that village was the primary unit of Indian civilization (Jodhka 2002b).

Moreover, given that nearly 70 per cent of India's population still lives in its more than half a million villages, it has also been seen as 'an arena for forces operating at regional, national, and international level' (Chauhan 2003: 409). Scholars working on various subjects invariably carry out their researches in the rural setting. The rural-urban classification is an important framework for the demographers for analysing the changes taking place in the Indian population. Similarly, for the political scientists, the local-level institutions of self-governance and the manner in which political opinion is articulated and mobilized at the village level is of crucial significance for understanding the dynamics of the Indian democracy.

It is rather interesting to note that the trajectory of 'village/rural studies' and 'agrarian studies' in India has had very little to do with the generic sub-discipline of 'rural sociology'. 'Rural sociology', as it is defined in the textbooks of sociology, emerged in the United States during the early twentieth century in response to some very practical needs of collecting information about the farm sectors (Atal 2003; A.R. Desai 1969). The civil war in the late nineteenth century and the ensuing 'farm crisis' saw the emergence of farmers' organizations demanding federal aid to solve the problems of rural areas afflicted by severe depression. Rural sociology in the United States came into existence essentially in response to this crisis (Newby 1980:10). The appointment of The Country Commission by President Roosevelt in 1907, in a way, marked the beginning of 'rural studies' in the United States. Theoretically, rural sociology remained caught up in bipolar notions of social change where 'rural' was defined as the opposite of 'urban' and 'rurality' was conceptualized as an autonomous sociological reality (Bonanno 1989).

Within the field of social anthropology, inspiration for 'village studies' in India came from the fieldwork tradition of British social anthropology and the new-found interest in 'peasantry' in the American academia during the post-Second World War period (Atal 2003; Jodhka 1998). The political restructuring of the world after decolonization had some important influences on the Western social sciences. The most significant feature of the newly emerged 'Third World' countries was the dependence of large proportions of their populations on agriculture. The struggle for freedom from colonial rule had also made the 'masses' and the 'elites' of these societies aware of their 'backward' economic conditions and of the need for social transformation/development.

'Development studies' emerged as a new area of academic interest during this period. Since a large majority of the populations in Third World countries were directly dependent on agriculture, understanding the prevailing structures of agrarian relations and working out ways and means of transforming them were the most important priorities for development studies. It was around this time that the concept of 'peasantry' found currency in the discipline of social anthropology. At a time when primitive tribes were either in the process of disappearing or had already disappeared, the 'discovery' of peasantry also provided a new lease of life to the discipline of social anthropology (Béteille 1974). The 'village community' was identified as the social foundation of the peasant economy in Asia (Breman 1987:1).

It is quite easy to see this connection between the Redfieldian notion of 'peasant societies' and the Indian 'village studies'. The single most popular concept that was used frequently by the anthropologists studying Indian village was Redfield's notion of the 'Little Community'. *Village India: Studies in the Little Community* (Marriot 1955) has a distinct impact of Robert Redfield.

Subjects like land relations, power structure, and social inequalities have not been completely alien to Indian sociology. Many of the colonial administrative reports offer useful insights into the institutional framework of Indian agriculture and the changes that came about after they introduced various reforms. Historians and economists also produced extremely valuable studies on subjects like land revenue systems, commercialization of agriculture, peasant indebtedness, and differentiation.

With the publication of Andre Béteille's *Studies in Agrarian Social Structure* (1974), 'agrarian studies' also gained some momentum within the disciplines of sociology and social anthropology in India (Jodhka 2003). Like 'village studies', agrarian studies also focus on rural populations, but their perspectives and approaches have been different. The two could be distinguished on the following grounds:

- 1. The 'village studies' and 'agrarian studies' are two distinct phases in the social scientific writings on rural life in India. While the 'village studies' were mostly carried out during the 1950s and 1960s, 'agrarian studies' gained popularity in India during the early 1970s.
- 2. The two traditions of studying Indian rural society dealt with different sets of questions. While social anthropologists generally studied a single village, focusing primarily on the social and cultural life of rural people and the manner in which rural society reproduced its 'moral social order', 'agrarian studies' invariably began with enquiring into the status of land economy in a broader framework of understanding change, or lack of it, in the sphere of production relations, distribution, marketing of agricultural surplus, and the rural power structure. Though many of those working on agrarian processes studied villages, the village was always seen in a broader regional context (Breman 1989).
- 3. The two traditions have also had very different theoretical orientations. As mentioned above, 'village studies' in India, at least in the beginning,

employed the functionalist anthropological approach. The Indian village was viewed in the universalistic perspective as an artifact of the 'traditional social order'. Practitioners of 'agrarian studies', on the other hand, derived most of their conceptual categories from the Marxist tradition of 'political economy'. Though fieldwork continued to be an important source of data collection, agrarian studies contextualized their questions in a historical framework.

The last two or three decades have seen a blurring of these differences. The tradition of village studies virtually came to an end by the early 1970s when agrarian studies peaked. However, interest in the latter also began to fade by the second half of 1980s. The shifts in economic policies during the early 1990s further marginalized all the issues relating to village and agriculture. However, given the democratic politics of India and the simple logic of demographics, rural populations could not be ignored for long. Rural and agrarian studies again picked up during the closing years of the twentieth century.

## **Institutionalization: Teaching and Research**

For a long time the study of rural India was equated with the study of Indian society. Village was seen as a convenient methodological entry point into the structure and processes of Indian society. Similarly, the village was also a popular location for carrying out researches on a diverse variety of subjects from family and kinship to health and ageing.

However, over the years rural and agrarian studies also emerged as a specialized branch of research and teaching. Several state-funded institutes were opened to focus specifically on rural India and the developmental processes associated with it. The National Institute of Rural Development (NIRD) in Hyderabad was set up to focus almost exclusively on the research in rural India and the various aspects of the changes taking place therein. NIRD also started a research journal—*Rural Development—*devoted especially to the subject. Several state governments have also set up similar institutes at the state level. These institutes also train the local bureaucracy on rural development related issues. Various agricultural universities set up in different parts of India—following the American model of research and extension—have also promoted researches on agrarian studies. Some of them offer specialized courses on rural sociology.

The teaching of rural society and agrarian change continues to be an important component of the courses on Indian society, taught as a compulsory course in sociology in almost all the Indian universities. Similarly, most Indian universities also teach one or more optional courses dealing specifically with subjects such as rural society, rural development, or agrarian change.

## **Trends in Rural and Agrarian Studies 1988–2002**

This section presents a brief overview of the trends in rural and agrarian studies during the period 1988–2002, followed by a more detailed and qualitative discussion of these trends in the following sections.

The quantitative-tabular summary of the trends in rural and agrarian studies during the period 1988–2002 is based on a survey of 350 publications (of the total of around 600 listed in the bibliography) published during the survey period. These references were identified using the *ICSSR Journal of Abstracts and Reviews* published during the period. The list is supplemented by our own library work.

## *Forms of Publications*

Studies on rural society and agrarian change in India appeared mainly in three different forms, viz., books, chapters in edited volumes, and research papers in professional journals. One unpublished report was also reviewed. As expected, a large majority of the publications were papers published in various national and international research journals (above 70 per cent), followed by books (22 per cent) and chapters in edited volumes (7.1 per cent) (see Table 3.1). Since most of the primary research is generally published first in research journals, the present data clearly reflects a healthy trend.

| Form of Publication         | Frequency | Percentage |
|-----------------------------|-----------|------------|
| Books                       | 77        | 22.0       |
| Chapters in Edited Books    | 25        | 7.1        |
| Research Papers in Journals | 247       | 70.6       |
| Reports                     | 1         | 0.3        |
| Total                       | 350       | 100.0      |

#### *Year-wise Volume of Publications*

Since the publication of the earlier survey commissioned by ICSSR on rural studies, covering the period until 1987 (see Alexander 2000), rural and agrarian studies appear to have seen some kind of a decline. The present survey of the publications of the studies during the period 1987–2002 reveals some interesting trends. Although there is a continuous flow of studies published each year, the first 10 years saw fewer publications. This was true particularly during the first half of the 1990s (especially during the year 1992–96) when very few researches came out on rural and agrarian India (see Table 3.2).

| Year  | Frequency | Percentage |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| 1988  | 12        | 3.4        |
| 1989  | 14        | 4.0        |
| 1990  | 17        | 4.9        |
| 1991  | 19        | 5.4        |
| 1992  | 8         | 2.3        |
| 1993  | 13        | 3.7        |
| 1994  | 10        | 2.9        |
| 1995  | 24        | 6.9        |
| 1996  | 8         | 2.3        |
| 1997  | 32        | 9.1        |
| 1998  | 45        | 12.9       |
| 1999  | 47        | 13.4       |
| 2000  | 29        | 8.3        |
| 2001  | 52        | 14.9       |
| 2002  | 20        | 5.7        |
| Total | 350       | 100.0      |

**Table 3.2** Year of Publication

This becomes even clearer when the period of 15 years is divided into three blocks of five years each. As shown in Table 3.3, compared to the first two blocks of five years, a much larger number of studies were published during the third block of five years, viz., from 1998 to 2002. This was particularly the case with research papers. This indeed reflects that the sub-disciplines saw a kind of revival during the closing years of the twentieth century.

There was also a shift in the forms of publications over these years. While more books were published during the first 10 years, their numbers came down during 1998–2002. There was, however, an increase in the number of research papers published in journals during the same period. This obviously indicates that most of these publications were from new researches, which are often first published in the form of research papers and later put together as books or monographs.

| Form of Publication         | Periods   |           |             | Total       |
|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|

**Table 3.3** Year-wise Forms of Publication

#### *Authorship*

Single individuals authored a majority of publications in the field. The 350 publications reviewed here were authored by a total of 440 scholars. Of these 350 publications, only 66 (19 per cent) had more than one author, and there were only 15 publications (4 per cent) that had three or more authors (see Table 3.4).

| Number of Authors | Frequency | Percentage |
|-------------------|-----------|------------|
| Single            | 284       | 81.1       |
| Two               | 51        | 14.6       |
| Three             | 11        | 3.1        |
| More than three   | 4         | 1.1        |
| Total             | 350       | 100.0      |

**Table 3.4** number of authors

In terms of gender, rural and agrarian studies is still dominated by men, though the presence of women authors was also not insignificant: they constitute 20 per cent of the total number of authors.

Women scholars invariably worked on gender related questions. Of the 36 studies reviewed on gender-related subjects, as many as 27 had been authored by women. The presence of women authors was slightly higher (24 per cent) in the studies carried out in south India.

## *Themes of the Published Studies*

On the basis of their primary focus, the studies covered can be classified into seven different sub-themes:

- i. *Agrarian relations* includes studies on agriculture, in general peasantry, land reforms, agricultural labour, drought, and problem of suicides/ agrarian crises.
- ii. *Rural development* consists of studies on rural development, developmental projects, and issues relating to rural poverty.
- iii. *Rural politics* includes studies on Panchayati Raj and other aspects of the political process in rural India.
- iv. *Gender.*
- v. *Caste and related issues.*
- vi. *Village life* includes studies which focus on the cultural life of 'village communities' and the residual themes such as village history, health, festivals, etc.
- vii. *Rural-urban studies* includes studies on rural-urban interactions, migration, and non-farm employment.

**Table 3.5** Focus areas of the Studies

## *Focus Population of the Studies*

A related area would be a review of the target populations in these studies, viz., the population groups on whom field surveys were carried out, or those populations/groups of people who constituted the core in historical analysis or in policy recommendations. The target populations represented in various publications during this time period can be broadly classified into six categories: (1) the weaker sections (poor, Dalits and tribes); (2) farmers and labourers; (3) women; (4) rural leadership and institutions, including NGOs and panchayats; (5) the village community; and (6) projects' evaluations.

As shown in Table 3.6, the category of farmers and labourers drew the highest attention during this period, followed by the village community and weaker sections. As in the case of the themes of the studies, over the years there were some shifts in the target population as well. Women began to be focussed on much more during the post-1993 period. Similarly, weaker sections also began to be studied with greater interest from 1998 the onward.

In terms of the geographical focus of the researches, published studies can be divided into eight categories: (1) north-west India, which includes the states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir; (2) north India, which includes the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand and Delhi; (3) western India, which includes the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Goa; (4) central India, which includes the states of Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh; (5) southern India, which includes the states of Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh; and (6) eastern India, which includes the states of Orrisa, West Bengal, and the seven states of the north-east region. Apart from publications focusing specifically on these regions, there were also some studies which compared the different regions or states of India. These are classified separately in the seventh category, under the heading 'inter-regional'. In the eighth category are included some studies which compared the Indian rural/ agrarian context with similar contexts in other countries of the world, and are classified as international.

It turned out that southern India was studied the most during the survey period with 79 (23 per cent) studies. At the other extreme is central India where only five (1.4 per cent) studies were conducted. A good number of studies were carried out in northern and north-western India. However, if one added northern India and the north-west, they would surpass the number of studies carried out in south India.

| Region              | Frequency | Percentage |
|---------------------|-----------|------------|
| North West          | 32        | 9.1        |
| North               | 47        | 13.4       |
| West                | 32        | 9.1        |
| Central             | 5         | 1.4        |

**Table 3.7** the Focus geographical Regions of the Studies

There were also some significant differences within regions. For example, in the northern region, the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were studied more than the other states. Similarly, in the north west, most studies were carried out in the state of Punjab. There were hardly any studies on the rural and agrarian scene in the state of Jammu and Kashmir during this period. The same was true for Goa in the western region (see Table 3.7).

As many as 78 studies (22 per cent of all the studies) were inter-regional in their orientation; another 13 (around 4 per cent) fall in the category of international studies, as they compared the Indian situation with other countries of Asia, or of the Third World. Interestingly, while a large number of the studies reviewed were confined to a single state (64.6 per cent), comparative studies invariably covered more than three states (see Table 3.8).

| Number of States Covered | Frequency | Percentage |
|--------------------------|-----------|------------|
| One                      | 226       | 64.6       |
| Two                      | 10        | 2.9        |

**Table 3.8** empirical Spread of the Studies (number of indian States Covered)

Based on their geographical coverage, the studies were further classified into four broad categories: (1) local, which included studies which had a limited focus like a village or a few villages of a single district of a state; (2) regional, which included studies covering the entire state or a number of states within a region; (3) national, which included the studies that covered the whole of India or a number of states cutting across various regions; and (4) international, which compared

India with some other country or countries. One-third of all the studies were local in nature. Nearly the same number of studies had a regional coverage. Nearly 20 per cent had national coverage and another 4 per cent were international in their coverage (See table 3.9).

## *Primary Source of Data for the Studies*

The studies published during the period varied a great deal in terms of the primary method used for collecting data/evidence. One of the following method was used: (1) field surveys; (2) ethnographic fieldwork; (3) secondary source material; and (4) review and evaluation. The conventional practice of qualitative ethnographic fieldwork continues to be an important mode of study among the sociologists and social anthropologists in India. Survey research has also become quite popular. A lot of research on the subject is also carried out through library research, using historical sources or available secondary data (see Table 3.10).

|                                      | Frequency | Percentage |

**Table 3.10** Primary Source of data for the Studies

It emerges that those studies, which used the fieldwork survey method, primarily focused on agrarian relations (31 studies) and on rural politics (24 studies). A good number of studies focusing on rural development also used field surveys. Those based on ethnographic fieldwork also studied agrarian relations and rural politics. Those looking at the impact of development programmes and projects in rural India used the technique of reviews and evaluation (see Table 3.11).

## *Primary Categories of Analysis*

The categories used in analysing rural populations and agrarian relation are important indicators of the theoretical framework guiding the scholars. The primary categories of analysis used in various studies can be broadly classified into five major groups: (1) the framework of class analysis and political economy; (2) caste and communities; (3) gender and patriarchy; (4) movements; and (5) evaluation of programmes and policies. Despite a general decline of the Marxist theory, the framework of class and political economy remained quite popular among the

students of rural and agrarian change in India. The categories of caste and communities have also been employed. More recently, gender and patriarchy have also become important frameworks for analysing rural social change (see Table 3.12).

Apart from pointing to the theoretical orientation of the authors, the choice of categories also indicates the interest and focus of the studies. Those using the categories of caste and communities focused predominantly on 'village community' and the weaker sections. Similarly, those working with the framework of class and political economy have worked predominantly on farmers and labourers. On the other hand, those using gender and patriarchy as the core categories in their research understandably focused on women (for details see Table 3.13).

## *Presentation of Data*

Since scholars use different methods for collection of data, their final presentation of findings is also different. As shown in Table 3.14, most studies used historical/ secondary source material or census data. However, the number of studies based on qualitative analysis is also significant. A trend towards combining various forms of data seems to be emerging.

**Table 3.14** Modes of data Presentation

This brief quantitative summary of the research trends in the field of rural and agrarian studies, of course, does not give the full picture of the literature reviewed. One need also to look at the contents of these studies in qualitative terms, which is attempted in the following sections.

## **'Old' Questions, 'New' Researches**

Beginning with the1980s, Indian society saw the emergence of a new agenda of research for the social sciences. This trend gained momentum during the 1990s with the liberalization process and the growing influence of neo-liberal ideology. Notwithstanding these changes in economic philosophy and priorities, the fact remains that nearly 70 per cent of India continues to live in rural areas and nearly two-thirds of the total population still depends on agriculture for survival. Despite their having become marginal in public discourse, research on agriculture and village has continued. The issues and agenda have understandably changed. The growing involvement of global agencies and the increasing participation of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have also brought about a change in the language of development. But the old issues have not gone away. A large number of writings and researches were published during the 15 years under review on subjects like land reforms, rural development, The Green Revolution, farmers' mobilization, labour, Panchayati Raj, and the caste system. In fact, in quantitative terms, during the period under survey the number of researches in these areas is quite large.

#### *Land Reforms and Rural Development*

On the eve of India's independence the most important issue for the rural people was the issue of land rights. Policy makers also stressed on the need for changing property relations in agriculture in order to motivate tillers of the land to produce more. It was with this dual motive of social equity and increasing productivity of land that land reform legislations were introduced during the early years of Independence. While land reforms as such have become history, writings on the subject still continue.

Recent writings on land reforms can be divided into two categories. The first category includes those that focus on the conventional issues such as implementation of different legislations in various states of India; the specific strategies used by the various categories of actors involved (peasant/tenants, landowners, political elite, bureaucracy, etc.) in scuttling or facilitating the implementation of different legislations. Some of these also look at the specific trajectories of the contexts that enabled the implementation of land reforms in some regions/subregions and their scuttling in some other regions/subregions (Damle 1993; Gill 2001; Jha 2002; Judge 1999; Radhakrishanan 1989; Yugandhar and Gopal 1993).

Then there are the studies that advocate the need for land reforms even today. Scholars have identified different reasons for advocating land reforms as a viable and meaningful strategy/policy of rural development. According to these scholars, land reforms were possibly the best method for empowering the landless. Their success would also facilitate democratization at the local level by eroding the power of the traditionally dominant sections of the rural society. They point out that those who do not own agricultural land are among the poorest. Land reform is also advocated for environmental protection. The possession of secure land titles encourages peasants to pursue sustainable practices of agricultural development (Ghimire 2002).

The collapse of the Soviet Union, and the end of the Cold War, has given a new confidence to the advocates of market-driven reforms. It is not only in the industrial and urban sectors of the economy that the philosophy of 'market'-driven economic change has triumphed. There has also been an advocacy of 'marketmediated' land reform measures for rural development. Another important change on the global scene has been the growing presence of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as agents of development. While NGOs have emerged as important agents of development, there has simultaneously been a trend towards the withdrawal of the State from the arena of development.

Some others have proposed the opposite solution. Given the increasing fragmentation of holdings, a case for collectivization of land through the village Panchayats has been made. Apart from making cultivation viable, such a process can help improve agriculture, it is argued. Collectively the farmers could use the latest technology more viably and without creating class polarization and social conflict. The panchayats could also play an important role in developing smallscale industries for processing agricultural products, thus generating additional employment (Gill 2001).

 The question of gender in relation to land reform legislations was also raised by another scholar, who, on the basis of her study of rural West Bengal, found that even though land reforms had been much more effective in the state, women had not gained much (Jayoti Gupta 2002).

The question of land has a caste dimension. In an elaborate exercise, B.B. Mohanty (2001) examined the landownership status of the scheduled castes (SCs) and scheduled tribes (STs) across 13 major states of India and found that even after 50 years of planned initiatives and policy measures, there has not been substantial improvement in the landholding status of the scheduled groups, the SCs and STs.

Some scholars have pointed to the emerging realities of agrarian relations in different regions of India. For example, in some pockets of India (such as Punjab) the nature and meaning of tenancy has completely changed with the growing popularity of what has come to be known as 'reverse tenancy' where, unlike in the past, it is the bigger farmers who lease-in land from smaller landowners. With subdivisions within the family, the latter's holdings have become too small to keep them bound to the land. Some of them move out of agriculture, to non-farm employment, giving their lands on lease to enterprising middle and big farmers (Gill 2001).

Along with land reforms some other programmes initiated for development after Independence have also been the concern of scholars, albeit to a lesser degree. Apart from the Green Revolution, which has remained an issue of contention and wider debate, some new works were also published on rural cooperatives during this period. Vikash N. Pandey (1994) provided an overview of the performance of them and advocated the need for looking at cooperatives from a historical perspective. An edited volume by Attwood and Baviskar (1988) presented a collection of papers on different kinds of cooperatives from different parts of India. In another study of the credit cooperatives of rural Haryana, Suinder S. Jodhka (1995d) found an important shift in their clientele. Against the classical perception of cooperatives as having become a tool in the hands of powerful interests in the village, he found that, over the years, things had changed considerably. The big landowners had withdrawn from cooperatives. The credit cooperatives functioned more like 'small men's banks'. Although the cooperatives were accessible to small farmers and the landless, they had become too bureaucratic and corrupt.

During this period the Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP) was the key talking point. Initiated in the late 1970s, the IRDP targeted the poor directly. This approach emerged out of the realization that the benefits of the Green Revolution did not necessarily 'trickle-down' to benefit the rural poor and the landless.

The studies of the IRDP mostly highlighted its limitations in terms of weak planning, lack of coordination between various aid-giving agencies, the involvement of middlemen, wrong identification of beneficiaries, cumbersome rules and the regulations, pervasive bureaucratic apathy, the anti-poor and anti-rural attitude of the administrative staff, insensitivity to local needs, the involvement of locally powerful interests in the identification of the poor, etc. (Gebert 1989; Gopal and Ramulu 1989). Some others pointed to the impact the IRDP could have in enhancing the autonomy of the poor and landless by providing them with alternative sources of employment (Jodhka 1995c).

The growing involvement of NGOs in rural development also drew the attention of the researchers. Advocates of the NGO movement argued that voluntary action could be a viable alternative to the state-sponsored programmes for the rural poor. The NGOs claim to have become a 'potent instrument for bringing about social transformation and building an egalitarian and humane society. It may be only a protest forum in the short run, but over time, it had considerable potential for effective social change' (Dantawala et al., 1998: 9). Though Gandhi had also advocated voluntarism and some Gandhians had been practising it all through, the NGO movement took off only with the growing interest of international funding agencies on the issue of rural poverty. The paradigm shift from state-oriented development to a market-driven economy also helped in giving legitimacy to the NGO movement. With NGOs came a new language of development—empowerment, participatory research appraisal (PRA), social capital. One of the most popular and effective programmes initiated by NGOs has been the promotion of *thrift societies* (Dantwalla et al. 1998; Khan and Thomas 1989; Rajasekhar 1998; Shripathi 1995; Alka Srivastava 1999; Swapan 1993).

#### *The Green Revolution and the Changing Agrarian Relations*

As was the case with land reforms, the study of the Green Revolution was also not a major concern among scholars during the period under survey. In fact, it is the petering out of the benefits of the Green Revolution and the negative environmental impact of the new agricultural technology that have been the subject of discussion. There have been several writings on the negative consequences of the Green Revolution technology, particularly its alleged role in depleting the groundwater and creating an environmental crisis (Shiva 1989).

However, some scholars have also defended the Green Revolution technology. Himmat Singh (2001), for example, argued quite passionately in defence of the Punjab experience of the Green Revolution. The positive effects of the new technology did not peter out after the initial successes. The state of Punjab continued to experience sustained rise in real per capita income levels through the decades of the 1980s and 1990s. Environmentally, agricultureled economic growth has had its positive effects. The Punjab experience shows that despite a rapid growth of its economy, the forest cover has not declined. On the contrary, the total area classified as 'forests' grew from 35,000 hectares in 1960–61 to 123,000 hectares in 1970–71 and to 222,000 hectares by 1990–91. On the social and political planes also, the Green Revolution did not widen inequalities or lead to a 'red revolution', as was predicted by some. On the contrary, it has been a 'scale neutral' technology (ibid.).

Though the Green Revolution technology was initially introduced in some selected pockets, it has spread over the years to other regions and states of India as well. The trajectory of agrarian change has, however, not been the same everywhere. Moreover, generalizations derived from the Punjab experience do not necessarily apply to other regions. In West Bengal, for example, green revolution was achieved without tractors. Irrigation and not mechanization was the 'leading input' in the agricultural modernization of that state. The use of HYV (high yielding variety) seeds and chemical fertilizers was introduced in a very different framework of agrarian relations. The introduction of new technology in the region was preceded by a successful implementation of land reform legislations, called 'operation *Barga*'. As a consequence, the new technology did not accentuate social inequalities in the West Bengal countryside (Dasgupta 1998). This situation was in contrast to neighbouring Bangladesh where, in the absence of land reforms, the Green Revolution widened social disparities (ibid.).

It has been more or less the same in Bihar. Notwithstanding its popular image of being a region without any economic dynamism, the agrarian economy of the state has been undergoing changes. The use of tractors and other machines has grown in some pockets of the state. So has the use of HYV seeds and chemical fertilizers. More importantly, the agrarian social structure has also undergone many changes. Based on a field study of a village of north Bihar, Anand Chakravarti (2001) points to the changes that everyday class relations had experienced in rural Bihar after the introduction of new technology. He argues that the social and economic landscape of Bihar was quite heterogeneous and the nature of stagnation and change also varied considerably within the state from one subregion to the other. While there are some pockets in Bihar where the Green Revolution technology has altered the traditional structures of agrarian relations, there are other parts of the state where industry has been a source of change.

Though the primary focus of Chakravarti's research is on the nitty-gritty of everyday class relations, he does not ignore the crucial reality of caste and its relevance for understanding the nature of the changes experienced in contemporary rural north Bihar. Caste, according to Chakravarti, defines the culture of exploitation.

Though agrarian relations in Bihar had changed, everyone was not better off than before. Chakravarti strongly criticizes those scholars who tend to ignore the profound negative impact that the process of capitalist development has had on the lives of the underclass. The dominant landowner, the *maliks,* could secure the intervention of various arms of the state to advance their interests. As a consequence of the concentration of economic, coercive, and social power in them, the *maliks* in the region were able to impose extremely rigorous working conditions on their labourers. They used unfree labour relations wherever it suited their interests (ibid.).

Earlier, Tom Brass too had argued on similar lines for Haryana. He questioned the classical expectancy of the Marxist theory that capitalist development necessarily releases labour from 'pre-capitalist' coercive relations. Brass argued that in the post-Green Revolution Haryana agriculture, farmers used the mechanism of debt and attachment to 'discipline' labour and to 'decompose/ recompose' the labour market, which led to the 'deproletarianization' of labour. He asserted that the indebted labourers of Haryana countryside were in fact 'bonded slaves'. Even when the recruitment itself 'was voluntary, in the sense that labourer willingly offered himself for work, the resultant relations of production need not be free in terms of the workers capacity to re-enter the labour market' (Brass 1990: 55; also see Brass 1995).

Brass's formulation was, however, qualified by Jodhka (1994, 1995b, 1995c, 1996). While Jodhka disagreed with scholars like A. Rudra (1990) who had earlier argued that the attached labour in the post-Green Revolution agrarian setting was more like permanent employment in the organized sector, he also questioned Brass's assertion that the 'bondage' of labourers with the farmers was getting stronger and wider. Instead, he suggested, the attached labour in the post-Green revolution agriculture ought to be viewed as 'a system of labour mortgage' where the labourers, despite an acute dislike for the relationship, were compelled to accept attachment for an interest-free credit. However, their loss of freedom being temporary in nature, they could not be character ized as bonded slaves. The growing integration of the village in the broader market, the increasing availability of alternative sources of employment outside agriculture, and the changing political and ideological environment generated a process which weakened the hold of landowners over the labourers. In some cases, developmental schemes, such as the Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP), being run by the Central government, also helped the labourers get out of attached relations.

Participating in the debate, Manjit Singh (1995) found Jodhka's position closer to the prevailing situation in Haryana agriculture. J. Mohan Rao (1999) pointed to the problems with categories of free and unfree labour relations given that capitalist relations are anyway about power and domination. Much of the disagreement between Jodhka and Brass, he argued, emerged out of the problems of interpretation.

Several other scholars also focused on similar issues during the decade of the 1990s. Evidence collected from different regions of India seems to confirm that the erstwhile system of attached labour was indeed declining (Breman 1993; 1996; da Corta and Venkateshwarlu 1999; Lerche 1998, 1999; Sen 1997), but they also point to enormous complexities and varieties of ways in which agrarian relations were changing in different parts of the country. For example, in their study of Tamil Nadu agriculture, Athreya and his colleagues found that the ecological differences had a role to play in determining agrarian relations. While in dry agriculture family labour was more important, wet agriculture required hired labour. A large majority of labourers in both the settings were employed on a casual basis and only bigger farmers kept a small core of labourers as permanent farm servants to complement or substitute family labour. However, it was only in the less developed dry areas that a large proportion of the attached labourers were bonded to their employers (Athreya et al. 1990). Against this, in the relatively less developed pocket of South Telangana in Andhra Pradesh, the traditional '*vetti'* system (attached/bonded labour) had nearly disappeared. All labour was employed on casual basis (Vaddiraju 1999). In fact, it was the absence of Green Revolution technology in the region which had weakened the hold of the locally dominant castes and had led to the emergence of backward castes as locally powerful groups (ibid.).

Several scholars have pointed to the fact that this process of change in labour relations has an interesting gender dimension. While men were leaving attached labour or in some cases even agricultural employment, women were forced to step in to fill the space vacated by them. In other words, the employer-farmers allowed male tied labourers to leave more easily if they substituted their female kin, usually their wives, to work on land (Kapadia 1997, 1999). This mobility of the male labourer to casual or non-farm employment has not only led to what has been described as the 'feminization of agriculture labour process' but also to some kind of a 'neo-bondage' of women labour (da Corta and Venkateshwarlu 1999; Kapadia 1999; Lerche 1999).

In another study of Andhra Pradesh, Priti Ramamurthy (1994) observed that though the availability of employment for women had gone up after the introduction of canal irrigation and new seeds, the women she interviewed did not think that their overall economic or social situation had improved significantly. While the women had to work for longer hours and more days of the year, there was no change in the overall value of the work they did. It was still defined as 'light work' by their men (ibid.).

Apart from the wider debate on the nature of changing agrarian relations in different regions of India, scholars have also written on other aspects of agricultural labour, changing patterns of their employment, forms of payment, patterns of migration, etc. Green Revolution technology has had a far-reaching impact on the labouring class. In this respect, Indian agriculture is different from some other regions of the world as 'poor people in India are not primarily "small farmers" but those dependent on irregular and unreliable wage income' (Harriss 1992). In other words, landless labourers did not directly feel any positive impact of the Green Revolution technology. In his study of two villages in Bihar, P.K. Jha reported that there had been no corresponding increase in wage rates or in the availability of employment in agriculture, though the productivity of land had increased in these villages (Jha 1997). S.R. Ahlawat (1988) found a similar situation in Haryana.

Another important aspect of labour relations in Indian agriculture is the presence of a variety of arrangements which employers have with labourers. The attached and casual labourers are not the only two forms of employment. In his research in two small localities in West Bengal, Ben Rogaly (1996) identified six main indigenous types of hired labour arrangements in each locality.

## *Agrarian Mobilizations*

One of the manifestations of the growing market orientation of agrarian production was the emergence of a totally new kind of mobilization by the surplus producing farmers who demanded a better deal for the agricultural sector. Interesting ly, these 'new' farmers' movements emerged almost simultaneously in virtually all the Green Revolution areas. Though initiated in the late 1970s, these movements gained momentum during the 1980s.

Using the language of neo-populism (Banaji 1994; Brass 1994; Dhanagare 1991; Gill 1994) and, in some cases also, invoking traditional social networks and identities of the landowning dominant castes (Dipankar Gupta, 1997), its leaders argued that India was experiencing a growing division between the city and the village. While the village represented the real people of the nation, urban India was alien and exploitative. The city exploited the village by manipulating terms of trade, practising the mechanism of 'unequal exchange'. The farmers received less for what they sold to the city and paid more for the farm inputs they bought from there (Omvedt 1994). The nature of farmers' politics was different. They initiated a new kind of rural politics—pressure group politics. Over the years some of them were also tempted to join party politics (Mukherji 1998).

Those who led these movements were mostly the substantial landowners who had benefited most from the developmental programmes and belonged to the numerically larger middle-level caste groups. This new 'social class' not only emerged as a dominant group at the village level, it also came to dominate the regional/state level politics in most parts of India. It had an accu mulated surplus which it sought to invest in more profit able enterprises. Some of the people belonging to this class diversified into other economic activities (Rutten 1995), or migrated to urban areas (Upadhya 1988, 1997), or entered into agricultural trade (Harriss-White 1996).

#### *Rural Political Process*

The transformation of the rural power structure was an important outcome of the development process initiated by the Indian state during the post-Independence period. One of the objectives of introducing land reform legislations was to weaken the power of absentee landlords and the landed elite. Further, on the recommendations of the Balwant Rai Mehta Committee, the three-tier Panchayati Raj system was introduced during the early 1960s in order to democratize the local-level power structure and decentralize governance. Since then there have been several reviews of the working of the system by committees and commissions appointed by the Government of India. On the recommendations of these committees, several changes and reforms have also been introduced to make the system more effective.

The empirical literature that came out during the first two or three decades after Independence pointed to the continued power of the traditionally dominant groups in most of rural India. Scholars repeatedly underlined the manner in which the vested interests in prevailing structures of power hindered the implementation of programmes meant for the welfare of the poor and the weak. In caste terms, the rural power revolved around the landowning dominant caste. Those who used the framework of class argued that it was the rich landowners and moneylenders who controlled the rural economy (Thorner 1956). Independent studies by scholars from different regions tended to suggest that panchayats had become yet another arena of influence and power for the already dominant groups in rural India (Alexander 2000; Oommen 1985).

More recently, scholars have pointed at the loosening of these structures of power at the local level. However, these changes have been differently conceptualized. On the basis of his work in Rajasthan, Oliver Mendelsohn has argued that though Srinivas was right in talking about 'dominant caste' during 1950s, such a formulation made less sense in the present-day rural India. The 'low caste and even untouchable villagers are now less beholden to their economic and ritual superiors than is suggested in older accounts' (Mendelsohn 1993: 808). Similarly, 'land and authority have been de-linked in Village India and this amounted to an historic if non-revolutionary, transformation' (ibid.: 807). On the basis of her study of villages in Uttar Pradesh, Sudha Pai (1998, 2001) makes a similar claim. Over the years, local Dalits in these villages have become quite assertive and have begun to challenge the traditional domination of the upper castes in the local-level political institutions. Similarly, they have also recognized the value of education and through it they now compete with the upper castes. The Jefferys questioned Pai's claim on the basis of the field data collected from the same region. They found the evidence that Pai provided in support of her claim about the 'dramatic change' in dominance relationship in western UP as inadequate. According to them, Pai based her conclusions merely on perceptions of change rather on the real process of change. They also questioned her claim about the extent of the increase in education among the Chamars and their ability to compete with the upper castes (Jeffery, Jeffery, and Jeffery 2001).

Writing on the basis of his field experience in Karnataka, G.K. Karanth (1996) argued that the traditional association of caste with occupation2 was weakening and *Jajmani* ties were fast disintegrating. Based on his fieldwork in rural Punjab, Jodhka argued that the older structure of the *Balutedari* system had nearly disintegrated in most of rural Punjab. He conceptualized this process through the categories of dissociation, distancing, and autonomy (Jodhka 2002a). As was earlier argued by Karanth, with the exception of a few occupations, no longer was there any association between caste and occupation in rural Punjab. Further, the Dalits in Punjab had also begun to distance themselves from the village economy and disliked working in the farms of local Jats. They were constructing their own cultural centres like religious shrines and community halls in order to establish their autonomy in the rural power structure. A study from rural Bihar also reported on the erosion of traditional *Jajmani* ties. Similarly, the village community as such exercised no control or influence on individuals in their selection of occupations (Sahay 1998).

Apart from these focused researches on the changing power relations in rural India, scholars have also been writing on various aspects of the Panchayati Raj. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment has further enhanced interest in the subject. The agenda of decentralization is being pursued a little more actively than it was prior to the amendment (Desai, 1990; Webster, 1992). The post-73rd Amendment to Panchayati Raj has also attracted some attention because of the introduction of a 30 per cent quota for women at all levels of representation in local-level institutions. Though it may be too early to draw any meaningful conclusions, some scholars have looked at the working of this new system of quota for women in Panchayati Raj institutions (Gowda 1998; Sudhir 1997). The evidence coming from the field suggests various things.

Some studies point to the obvious fact that women were only the nominal heads and the real power remained with their men. They have questioned the intentions behind such reforms (Rajesh Kumar 1995; Webster 1990). However, others have shown how the presence of women in these positions of power have made a difference for the women who got elected to panchayats and how there women have affected the village scene on the whole. B. Datta (1998), for example, reported there was less corruption in villages where women were in power, and there was a greater demand to provide better services to the village communities. Similarly, on the basis of her study of rural Karnataka, Govinda S. Gowda (1998) observed that the participation of women in local-level political institutions enabled them to emerge as effective leaders and also to act as catalytic agents by inspiring confidence and giving a stimulus to social change among rural women (see also Baviskar 2002).

Some scholars have also carried out region-specific assessments of the working of panchayats (Surat Singh 1991; Sukhdev Singh et al. 1995; Webster 1990) in different political set-ups. G.K. Lieten (1996a, 1996b), who studied the working of panchayats in West Bengal as well as in eastern Uttar Pradesh, found many fundamental differences in the two states. While in the case of West Bengal the working of panchayats reflected the broader process of social change where the hitherto excluded and marginalized groups had been able to come into the mainstream, in Uttar Pradesh the situation seemed hopeless as such institutions had only enhanced the dominance of the traditionally dominant landowning castes.

Notwithstanding the continuities and regional variations, the post-73 rd Amendment to Panchayati Raj has certainly enhanced participation and has encouraged the previously excluded groups and communities to assert themselves for their rights and dignity.

#### *Crises of Agriculture*

The farmers' movements during the 1980s also reflected the growing discontent among the farming classes. Apart from bringing in greater integration of the agrarian economy with the larger market, the Green Revolution also raised the aspirational level of the rural populations. A small section among them have been able to diversify into other occupations, but a large majority of the landowning communities continue to be dependent on agriculture alone. However, there is very little uncultivated land available in most parts of India that can be brought under irrigation to take care of the increasing population. As a result, the holdings have been getting smaller with families dividing their lands among their offspring. The growing pressure of competing in the global market and a gradual withdrawal of the state have also had an adverse effect on agriculture.

As the new agricultural practices have considerably enhanced the market orientation of the cultivators, all inputs required for cultivation have to be bought from the market. Since the smaller cultivators rarely have surpluses of their own, they invariably need to borrow for the fulfilment of such requirements. Their sources are mostly informal. At times they have to borrow for consumption and allied social requirements, such as weddings and major illnesses in the family. Agriculture being the only source of income, a crop failure could easily lead to a difficult situation for such cultivators.

Jodhka's study of three villages in a Green Revolution district of Haryana carried out during the late 1980s showed that the average out standing debt of small and marginal farmers—taken from informal sources—was the highest, even in absolute terms, compared with other categories of farmers (Jodhka 1995e: A124). This continuing trend has resulted in a serious crisis in the agrarian sector leading to situations of desperation for some of the indebted farmers.

Beginning with the second half of the 1990s, media reports have been highlighting incidents of suicides by indebted farmers, virtually from all the Green Revolution pockets of India, viz., Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and even Punjab. Commentators on the subject have mostly tended to see a close link between the suicides by the farmers and their growing indebtedness, the result, in most cases, of successive crop failures.

H.S. Shergill (1998) locates the context of the growing indebtedness amongst the Punjab farmers in the declining growth rate of agriculture, particularly during the 1990s. He found that dspite a high rate of growth in agricultural production, the per capita income of the farmers has not increased simultaneously. More critically, much of the additional income had been absorbed by an increase in the per capita expenditure and the 'rising living/consumption standards of the farming community'. With the growth in consumption having absorbed almost the entire increase in the real income of most of the agrarian population, only a few farmers were left with any surplus of their own. 'As a consequence, farmers had to, regularly and routinely, borrow huge amounts' to finance modern agriculture.

Two studies of the growing number of suicides among Punjab farmers (Iyer and Manick 2000; Kumar and Sharma 1998) had observed that those who committed suicide were mostly men from the landowning dominant castes. They were either small or middle farmers, owning land up to around 10 acres, or were completely landless. A majority of them were below the age of 30 and most had killed themselves by consuming pesticides.

The studies found a direct link between indebtedness and the suicides. Due to the declining size of operational holdings and fragmentation, small and marginal farmers were getting pauperized, the growth rate had come down, and the costs of inputs had gone up. However, debt was not the only reason for the suicides. There were other social factors too. Kumar and Sharma (1998) found 'family discord' and 'alcohol and illicit drug use' to be the other causes that drive the farmers to committing suicide.

A general breakdown of the earlier ecological balance, the disintegration of the 'community' and kinship support system in most parts of rural India, and the rise of some kind of individualistic orientation have also been identified as crucial factors leading to such a crisis (Ahalwat 2003; Iyer and Manick 2000;Vasavi 1999). Apparently the *Biradaris* or the new institutions like Panchayats and *Mahila Mandals* were of little help to the desperate families. While in the case of southern states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, voluntary agencies (the NGOs) did come forward to help, in the states like Punjab there were no institutions or agencies providing support to such families.

The growing indebtedness of farmers led to an increase in the suicide rates in some regions while in others it prompted land transfers from owner cultivators to moneylenders. A study reported that in Tamil Nadu tribal peasants were losing their lands to non-tribals. Tribals were invariably uneducated and were in the habit of drinking, resulting in their indebtedness and eventually to the loss of their land. This process was pushing them further into poverty and marginalization (Karuppaiyan 2000). R.S. Deshpande (2002) found in his study that compared to the traditional modes of agriculture, the post-Green Revolution commercial crops are much more fragile in nature and therefore more vulnerable to climatic changes. The corrupt markets play their own role. Farmers invariably end up buying spurious quality seeds and pesticides. In the absence of any viable insurance schemes and other securities, farmers invariably land themselves in a serious crisis. Suicides are one such manifestation of these crises.

## **Emerging Trends**

As mentioned earlier, the classical tradition of 'village studies' had more or less disappeared by the late 1960s. Agrarian studies became popular during the 1970s. Though initiated by economists, sociologists and social anthropologists also joined them in giving a spurt to this new trend. The economists valued the interaction with the anthropologists in their efforts to understand the complexities of the traditional structures of rural social and economic life. The dominant theoretical framework during this period was that of political economy. 'Agrarian studies' flourished for nearly two decades.

However, the decades of 1980s and 1990s were an important turning point in Indian history. The Indian social sciences, as also the Indian society, witnessed many new trends. Several 'new' social movements rose during the 1980s. They questioned the wisdom of the developmental agenda of that time. The following decade saw the beginning of liberalization policies and a gradual withdrawal of the State from the sphere of economy. This was an important ideological and policy shift, marking a decline in the Nehruvian framework of development and social transformation.

Coupled with the changes in the geopolitics of the world, following the collapse of the communist states in Eastern Europe and the end of the Cold War, and the arrival of new technologies of telecommunications, this period also saw the beginning of a new phase in the reach of global capital. The process of 'globalization', as it has come to be known, is not confined to the economy alone. It has also influenced culture and politics everywhere and has opened up new possibilities for social interactions and networking.

The theoretical orientation and research agenda of the social sciences have also seen many changes during this period. Indian social science could not have remained un-influenced by these processes. The gradual fading away of the older concern and a simultaneous ascendancy of new modes of thinking had some serious implications for 'rural' and 'agrarian' studies in India. Virtually all shades of 'rural' and 'agrarian' studies which were carried out between 1950 and 1980 were linked to 'development' and the 'developmental state'. The growing influence of the 'neo-liberal' economic philosophy not only led to an erosion of the 'developmental state' but also changed the priorities of development studies. There was virtually a 'paradigm shift' in the theory and practice of development.

#### *Globalization and Agriculture*

An important aspect of this paradigm shift has been the expansion of the reach of the market and promotion of the consumption culture. A direct implication of this has been the growing centrality of the middle classes and a gradual marginalization of the 'rural' and the 'agrarian' from the popular imaginations of those who matter in the countries of the Third World and in the global economy.

The new regime of globalization aspires to restructure virtually every aspect of the Third World economies, including agriculture. From the system of state protection, subsidies, regulated markets, and support prices, the farmers are being asked to change and prepare themselves for global competition. On the one hand the farmers will have to negotiate with the new system of patented seeds, and on the other, food processing and related industries are likely to get more directly involved with the agrarian sector. One such form of involvement could be through 'contract farming'. Though the involvement of agro-business corporations is so far confined only to small pockets of Karnataka and Maharashtra, the trend is likely to grow in the years to come (Banaji 1999).

The growing demand for processed food and the integration of Indian agriculture into global economy could have far-reaching implications for the farming communities and the rural social life. This process is still incipient and much of the discussion on the subject has been speculative, coming mostly out of the ideological predispositions of different scholars. The neo-liberal economists, and a section of the farmer unions, hope that the globalization of Indian agriculture will infuse new energy and dynamism into the agrarian sector and will eventually benefit all. Other scholars, with left-wing dispositions, are quite sceptical and have warned of the 'dangers' that these shifts could have for the Indian economy. Globalization, they fear, could turn out to be particularly devastating for Indian agriculture.

Some of the left-wing economists have, for example, argued that this kind of capitalist globalization could be harmful for the food security of India. The priorities of Indian farmers would be dictated by external factors instead of the requirements of the local populace. In the new regime of market-driven production, farmers may move to production of those commercial crops that have greater demand in the global market, resulting in a shortage of food grains in the country. According to these economists, this is precisely what happened when the British colonial rulers forced the Indian peasants to produce cotton over food grains in order to meet the demands of the Industrial Revolution in Britain during the nineteenth century (see, for example, Patnaik 1998). Some others have pointed to the environmental problems and lack of sustainability of such practices. According to some others the new patent regime would lead to genetic erosion and a loss of the native varieties of seeds (Shiva et al. 1999).

However, M.N. Panini (1999) contested such a view on the basis of his study of floriculture in Karnataka. He argued that agribusiness became popular in the region after globalization injected a sense of optimism into the farmers. The farmers saw the new plant varieties and new cultivation techniques as opening the doors to economic prosperity. Their growing prosperity also gave a boost to the local economy. They were constructing new houses and spending more on the education of their children. The farmers were also moving out of the smaller houses in the villages to bigger farmhouses, which resulted in the weakening of the older caste ties and the expansion of caste neutral spaces (ibid.).

Sociologists and social anthropologists have, however, done very little empirical work in this area to opine in conclusive terms about the possible implications of the process of globalization on agriculture, or on the rural society.

## *Culture and Agriculture*

Perhaps the most important aspect of the 'paradigm shift' that took place in the social sciences during the 1990s was a renewed interest in culture. Culture had always been one of the core categories in the textbooks of sociology and social anthropology. Peasant societies were classically defined in terms of a people following a specific *way of life* where land was both a source of livelihood as well as a source of identification (Shanin 1987).

Such a notion of culture was, however, widely criticized for being too general. Also it could not deal with issues such as power/domination, exclusion/inclusion. The 'new' notion of 'culture' that became popular during the 1990s drew its resources from the Marxist critical theory, post-modern/post-colonial theories, and some new trends in American anthropology. Culture, in the 1990s, came to acquire the status of a paradigm. Several scholars have written on the Indian rural scene and the peasant/agrarian economy using such a framework.

The first major attempt in this direction came from the discipline of history where the scholars belonging to 'subaltern studies' attempted new interpretations of peasant consciousness in South Asia. Pioneered by Ranajit Guha, the subaltern historians criticized the prevailing tradition of history-writing that tried to subsume peasant politics under the broader framework of the elite politics thus erasing the agency of the subaltern classes. As autonomous agents of history, they argued, peasants and workers could create their own forms of oppositional culture and identity (Guha 1982). Though subaltern studies were initiated during the early 1980s, they continued to produce books through the 1990s and their influence has been felt beyond the discipline of Indian history (Hardiman 1992; Prakash 1992).

Another trend, which shared the notion of culture with 'subaltern studies', and which appeared around the same time, though in a different context, was the advocacy of looking at 'everyday forms of peasant resistance'. Initiated by James C. Scott (1990), the proponents of this view argued that in the absence of any organized struggle, the peasants who are subjected to social and cultural subordination produce mundane and hidden ways of resisting oppression: through avoidance, ridicule, and acts of petty revenge. The cumulative effect of these 'weapons of the weak' could, at times, be more effective in ameliorating their condition than organized collective action.

Using a similar critical/political notion of culture, some scholars also carried out ethnographic studies in rural India. However, their focus and arguments have been very different from the classical village studies of the 1950s and 1960s. On the basis of his study of Alipur, a village in western Uttar Pradesh, Akhil Gupta (1999), for example, looked at the implications that the discourse of development has had for the identities of the residents of the village. Development, according to him, was not merely a programme for social and economic change, but also an ideology and a discourse of post-colonialism. It was a body of knowledge which has been used by the new elite of the Third World countries to gain legitimacy for their rule and has shaped the everyday lives of the common people in a specific manner. Underdevelopment, he argued, was not merely a structural location in the global community of nations; rather, it was also a form of identity, something that informed people's sense of self. Apart from the identities of caste, class, region, and sexuality, the rural north Indians today have also acquired the identity of being underdeveloped, of lagging behind the West. The discourse of development made people look at things through a specific set of binary opposites: East-West, Orient-Occident, backward-advanced, and traditional-modern. It was during the colonial period that these binaries and this language of understanding the differences between the West and the 'rest' were first worked out by the colonizers. However, even after the end of direct colonial rule, the language in which the West understands the Third World and the way the Third World understands itself have not changed much. The continued use of the 'traditional-modern' dichotomy even today is evidence of this (ibid.).

Some scholars have also looked at the manner in which the dissemination of modern agricultural methods implicates the local agricultural knowledge. The new regime of development, and the intervention of external agents like the state, causes the re-ordering of the relationship that the local community had with the land. Arjun Appadurai, in his study of Maharashtra, for example, observed that the adoption and practice of modern agriculture led to a differentiation of the knowledge base of agriculturalists and a schism between subsistence and commercial agriculture. Such differentiation and alienation of knowledge from its original social base disintegrated the local community (Appadurai 1989). Nandini Sundar too looked at the 'local modes of history-telling', or the meanings that people invest in, or derive from their past in Bastar. These myths, she argued, may not be accurate indicators of historical events but they often formed the basis on which social relations were sanctified or legitimized (Sundar 2002: 145–6, 1997; also see Saldana 1990).

Another interesting work in this direction is that of A.R. Vasavi (2000) who studied droughts in north Karnataka. Though drought has been a common occurrence in Bijapur, the response of the community has undergone a complete change with the modernization of agricultural production. 'In contrast to earlier forms of agriculture and agrarian life in which loss of crops was located within cosmological and social reasons, the modern production regime, based on market and scientific bases, provides no acceptance or collective framework with which persons can come to terms with loss of crops or the loss of sustenance capacities in agriculture….Modern agriculture which provided quick and high productivity and profit provided no collective and integral frame through which loss of crop or a crisis in agriculture could be comprehended and dealt with' (ibid.: 118–19).

These studies are important as their conceptual formulations help in understanding the sudden spurt in suicides among cultivators in different parts of the country.

However, not everyone working on Indian agriculture, or on rural life, has been equally influenced by the culturalist position. In fact, there has been some strong criticism of these trends, particularly of 'subaltern studies' and of Scott's work on the 'weapons of the weak'. On the basis of his fieldwork in rural Uttar Pradesh, Dipankar Gupta (2001) argued that Scott's claim about the so-called 'everyday forms of peasant resistance' was actually based on the negative stereotypes that big landowners had spread about the poor peasants. To say that all poor peasants were cheats and liars helped the landlords justify their routine repression of the peasants. While some peasants did 'lie' and 'cheat', like every one else, there was nothing salutary about it and these 'everyday forms of resistance' never led to any 'cumulative effect' that altered the existing structures of power and domination (ibid.). In his study of 'social power and everyday class relations', Anand Chakravarti (2001) has also argued that the low-profile strategies, or the so-called 'weapons of the weak', hardly had the potential of making any substantive difference in the subordinate situation of the labouring class.

Pitching his critiques at a more general and theoretical level, but basing his argument on data from Haryana, Tom Brass said that common to all those who invoke concepts like 'moral economy', 'everyday forms of peasant resistance', 'subalterns' was the classical populist notion of undifferentiated peasantry. Postmodernism and culturalism had, in a way, revived the old 'agrarian myth' about peasant essentialism. Though they appeared radical, in reality such writings on peasantry were conservative in nature. The ideological positions they advocated were basically hostile to any project of social emancipation informed by Enlightenment ideas and hope (Brass 1991, 2000). On the basis of his empirical work in Rajasthan, Hira Singh (2002) also criticized the 'Subaltern Studies' for their symptomatic underestimation of the significance of land relations. He argued, that they worked with epistemological assumptions that were elitist (Brahminical–bourgeois) in nature (ibid.). However, notwithstanding such harsh criticism, the culturalist tradition is likely to stay, at least for some time to come.

#### *Gender, Culture, and Patriarchy*

Most of the new studies using the paradigm of 'culture' were, directly or indirectly, targeted against the Marxist tradition of political economy that tried to reduce everything to class or economy. The Marxists had never been very important players in Indian social anthropology or sociology. However, their influence on 'agrarian studies' was quite significant at the global level. 'Women' and 'gender' studies, which began to gain momentum during the 1980s and 1990s, questioned such frames of analysis where gender was not treated as a separate category. They criticized the gender-blindness of 'development studies', which included agrarian and rural studies in India as well. Though many of the Indian 'village studies' of the 1950s and 1960s did report on the differences between men and women in village life, they invariably presented such differences as 'a natural order of things' (Jodhka 1999). Similarly, in the famous debate on the dominant mode of production in Indian agriculture carried out by Marxist scholars during the 1970s, there were hardly any references to the different ways in which men and women were subordinated in different modes of production.

Apart from pointing to the 'gender blindness' of much of the development theory, and the empirical surveys on issues such as poverty and land rights of women in the region (Bina Agarwal 1998, 1994), students of gender and agrarian change have also shown how the new technology had a clear bias against women. It marginalized the female agricultural wage labour in terms of both work as well as earnings (Chowdhry 1994; Kapadia 1996).

At the substantive level, scholars have repeatedly pointed to the differential wage rates paid to men and women. As discussed in the previous section, a more important process commented upon by scholars during this period was the *feminization* of agriculture. This process is directly linked to the male outmigration from the families with small and marginal holdings in search of better employment, leaving the small plots of land under the care of their women.

Scholars have also pointed to internal differences among women and the differential impact of change on classes or categories of women. Joan P. Mencher, for example, argues that the type of work women do depends on the social class to which they belong (Mencher 1996). Among the landless women regularly work both in the fields and at home. Among the small landowners, they work on their own farms and at times even on wage. Among the bigger landowners too, apart form the household work, women do a lot of work in the cattle shed. A lot of women in these households also supervise their farms, particularly where the male head is not around (ibid.).

Some scholars have also commented on the status correlates of women participation in farm labour. A study from West Bengal reported that 'the relative social rank of a household was affected by the degree to which women carried out manual work. Within this, hiring out for work in the field indicated the lowest rank, carrying out work on land owned by the household indicated the next lowest, withdrawal from work on the field the highest. However, this was true only about caste Hindus and such a value-frame did not operate among the Santals, a tribe living in the same region (Rogaly 1996: 144).

H. Lambart has looked at the differential meanings of belonging and identity that men and women have in rural Rajasthan. When viewed at from the perspective of women, categories like caste, kinship, and village unity have different meanings. While men can live all their life in the village they are born in, women can rarely do so. They almost always have to migrate out of their native village at the time of their marriage. They carry, however, with them the identity of the village they were born in. However, in their memory of the native village, the questions of exclusion and hierarchy weigh less than the common identity of the native village. For example, while interacting with visitors from their parental village, the differences of caste and kinship are of relatively less significance for them than they are for men (Lambert 1997).

#### *Ecology and Environment*

With the decline of the Nehruvian ideology during the 1980s and the growing influence of post-modernist critiques of development, the questions of environment assumed prominence. Different parts of India witnessed powerful mobilizations around the questions of ecology and environment during the 1980s. The famous *Chipko* movement by the local poor in the Himalyan region against the felling of trees for commercial use, and the mobilization against the displacement of tribals and peasants from their villages for the building of a dam on the Narmada river acquired global visibility.

The vastly influential writings of Ramachandara Guha (1989) on the *Chipko*  movement and Amita Baviskar's (1995) book on the *Narmada Bachao Andolan*  appeared during the period under review. Several other scholars have also written on these movements and on the issues of rehabilitation of the displaced (Das 1996). Some have also written on the questions relating to common property resources (CPR) in rural India and how their depletion is affecting the rural poor. The poor in rural India derived part of their livelihood from CPRs. However, with the Green Revolution and other changes in the rural economy these resources have been shrinking making life more difficult for the poor and the marginal (Beck 1994; Beck and Ghose 2000; Chakravarty-Kaul 1999; Chopra 2001; Didibhavi 2000; Jodha 1995).

Apart from the writings on these two movements, several other questions of environment and ecology have also been of interest to sociologists and social anthropologists. In fact, there has been a spurt of researches on related issues. For example, the sustainability of the new technology and the viability of the Green Revolution have become compelling issues not only for the social scientists but also for policy makers and planners. Some scholars have also raised questions about the manner in which natural resources ought to be used. What should be the role of the state, the market, and the local communities in their management and regulation? How can the use of these resources be regulated? (Amita Baviskar 1999; Ashish Bose 2000; Kothari 1996; Roy Burman 1989; Sundar et al. 2001).

Environment and ecology have not merely been new areas of research for sociologists and social anthropologists; the popular discourses on environment have also raised questions about the nature of Indian rurality. The discourse on environment has, in a way, revived some of the old notions of tradition and village life that tend to essentialize rural populations into homogeneous communities (Amita Baviskar 1999; Jodhka 2001; Patel 2001).

## *Village and Agriculture in India Today*

As discussed earlier, Indian society began to see qualitatively different trends during the decade of the 1980s. The rise of new social movements questioned the hegemonic status of the idea of development. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the ascendance of neo-liberal economic policies, globally as well as nationally, further marginalized the idea of development, as it had come to be known during the post-Second World War period. The growing reach of telecommunication technology, and the resultant globalization, produced a paradigm shift in the social sciences. The new language made popular by different varieties of postmodernist writings further reinforced such a shift.

The implications of this shift for rural and agrarian studies were many. The growing hegemony of the market brought the consumer middle class to the centre stage of the Indian society. The middle class grew in size; but more then its quantitative growth was the enlargement of its influence. A direct corollary of this was the marginalization of 'the rural'. Similarly, agriculture began to be talked about in terms of 'crisis'. From being the proud producers of food grains for the masses of India, the hard-working farmers and rural labourers began to be seen as being dependent on the state and lacking in competitive spirit. The study of agriculture and rural society was no longer in fashion.

In the discipline of sociology/social anthropology, as also in the common imagination, there has been a close relationship between agriculture and the 'rural'. One of the core defining features of the village has been the dependence of a majority of its population on the agrarian economy. However, with growth of technology and the growing integration of agriculture into the broader market economy, agriculture begins to take on the features of industry. In the developed countries of the West, agriculture has already been subsumed under the food processing industry. This has not happened in India so far but the trend is likely to pickup. This marginalization of agriculture obviously has far-reaching implications for the agrarian economy and also for our understanding of 'the rural', in terms of its properties as a type of social and cultural reality. One of the direct implications of such a process will be that agriculture will no longer be synonymous with the rural.

As the urban becomes accessible to the rural populations for employment, and for politics and leisure/entertainment, the nature of rural populations also begins to change and becomes more and more fluid. The labour moves out of the village in search of better and 'secular' employment, the farmers look for opportunities beyond agriculture, thus leading to a blurring of the boundaries between 'rural' and 'urban' (Racine 1997; Rutten 1995; Sharma and Gupta 1991; Varshney 1995).

Though in India demographically the rural population has not yet seen any decline, the village has certainly begun to disintegrate as a social, economic, and cultural unit. Although this process is not visible everywhere to the same extent, the village is changing everywhere. When a village in Punjab attracts labour from eastern Uttar Pradesh or Bihar and this labour replaces the local labour, the rural life in less developed pockets from where the labour migrates also undergoes a considerable change. Mass media and growing communication are also playing some role in this process of social, cultural and political transformation of rural life (Dwarakanath 1998; Johnson 2000; Kapadia 1997).

Over the last 15 years or so, scholars have also begun to increasingly reflect on the disciplinary traditions. Various scholars have critically scrutinized the tradition of 'village studies' during this period. Inden pointed to the manner in which social anthropologists of the period tended to essentialize India as a land of villages (Inden 1990), an assumption which was borrowed uncritically from the colonial discourses on the Indian society (Jodhka 1998), and in the process characterized Indian society as a single totality (Niranjana 1991). Some scholars also wrote about the changing notions of village in the history on contemporary India (Breman 1997).

## **Concluding Comments**

Rural and agrarian studies in India saw several ups and downs during the 15-year period covered in this review. The first ten years of the survey period saw a general decline of interest but during the last five years there has again been a revival of interest in agrarian studies. More importantly, perhaps, the period was marked by the beginning of some important trends of research and shifts in the focus and perspective. Similarly, some other trends which had started earlier, were consolidated during this period.

Scholars no longer have a unified framework within which they see the village society, functionalist or Marxist. Village today means different things to different people. There has been a kind of differentiation of interest. 'Rural' is rarely studied today for its own sake.

Similarly, when one thinks of agriculture today, one does not think of toiling peasants of a subsistence economy, living in a traditional and closed set-up. Agriculture is now integrated with the market. Even those areas where the Green Revolution technology had not been introduced are now catching up. The growing integration of agriculture into the market economy also means the growing vulnerability of the agricultural sector. The trends in global and local markets directly influence the agrarian population. The cultivators and landless labourers also respond differently. While farmers agitate for the protection of their interests, workers look beyond the village for better opportunities for employment.

However, despite this 'disintegration' of the rural, and a gradual decline in the significance of agriculture in the Indian economy, the logic of demographics works against any attempts to ignore these areas of research. Despite a considerable increase in the absolute size of the urban population, a large majority of the Indian population continues to live in rural settlements and remains dependent on agriculture for its survival. Even through the urban population has been growing in proportional terms, there has not yet been any decline in the absolute size of the rural population. Neglect of 'agriculture' and 'rural populations' can thus be socially and politically perilous. It is perhaps for this reason that, after a decline of interest for nearly a decade, rural and agrarian studies have picked up once again.

There has been an important qualitative shift in the approach towards the rural. Until around the end of the 1970s, social scientists could treat 'the rural' and 'the agrarian' as being synonymous with India. When a social anthropologist studied a village of Tamil Nadu or Uattar Pradesh during 1950s, he/she invariably treated the enterprise as an exercise in studying Indian society. Similarly, the economist who debated on the changing mode of production in Indian agriculture during the 1970s tended to extend the findings of his her research in a limited area as a generalization applicable to the Indian society at large rather easily.

This is perhaps not the case any more. 'Rural' and 'agriculture' today are only specific areas of research. The discourses on Indian society, or on its economy, have to take many more things into account.

At another level, the 'rural' has increasingly become a subject for advocacy. Unlike the earlier studies, which were mostly carried out by scholars from universities, spending a good deal of time in a single or a few villages, most of the advocacy work is undertaken by 'development professionals' working invariably with internationally funded NGOs. Most of their 'researches' are carried out quickly and are meant primarily for the consumption of development agencies. These researches are invariably donor- driven and their conclusions follow a predetermined course3 .
