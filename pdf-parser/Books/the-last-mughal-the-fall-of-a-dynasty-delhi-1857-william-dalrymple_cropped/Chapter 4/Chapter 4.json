In this spirit, the district judge of Fatehpur, Robert Tucker, had recently set up large stone columns inscribed with the Ten Commandments in Persian, Urdu, Hindi and English and used 'two or three times a week to read the Bible in Hindoostanee to large numbers of natives who were assembled in the compound to hear him'.<sup>14</sup></p>",

Sati, the burning of Hindu widows, had been outlawed in 1829, alarming many orthodox Hindus; another law allowing the remarriage of Hindu widows horrified many more. Since then stories had been circulating of the ways in which the British were using government orphanages to convert parentless children, a tendency that seemed to be confirmed by the legislation introduced in 1832 allowing converts to inherit ancestral property, something explicitly forbidden by the sharia. There were also claims that missionaries had been allowed a free hand to preach to the (literally) captive audience in the Company jails: not an unlikely charge, since the Superintendent of Jails for the region was also on Jennings' committee.<sup>44</sup></p>",

For thirty years Azurda had balanced his place as the chief Muslim judge (<i>Sadr Amin</i>) in Delhi and a leading literary figure and mufti at court, with a mild Anglophilia: a natural mediator, he had argued that employment by the Company was entirely legitimate in Muslim law, and that any notion of jihad was quite inappropriate since the British had allowed full religious freedom.<sup>59</sup> Now, however, even Azurda began to have serious doubts about the direction British policy was taking, and quietly went about dissuading his students at Delhi College from paying any attention to 'Christian propaganda'.<sup>60</sup> Others were more outspoken. According to one missionary: \"The Muslims would gladly overthrow the English. They tell [us] plainly, \"If you were not the rulers, we would soon silence your preaching, not with arguments but with the sword.\"<sup>61</sup></p>",

Even the practice of eating on banana leaves was anathematised.

This relationship is a very straightforward one: if you worship God in the proper way you will be rewarded – on the Day of Judgement you will go to paradise – and if you do not, you will go to hell.

They argued instead that God should be worshipped not because he had commanded us to it, but because he was such a lovable being. As a result all traditions were tolerated: anyone was capable of expressing his or her love for God, and that ability transcended religious associations, gender or indeed one's place in the social order.

Like much verse of the period, it was deeply imbued with the Sufi ideals of love, which were regarded as much the surest route to a God who was seen to be located not in the heavens, but deep within the human heart. For if the world of the heart lay at the centre of Sufism, it also formed the cornerstone of the principal literary form in late Mughal Delhi – the ghazal, which derived its name from the Arabic words 'talking to a woman about love'<sup>76</sup> The love of the ghazal poet was ambiguous – it was rarely made entirely clear whether it was sacred or worldly love to which the poet referred. This ambiguity was deliberate, for just as the longing of the soul for union with God was believed to be as compelling and as all-embracing as the longing of the lover for the beloved, both loves could be carried to the point of insanity or what Sufis called <i>fana</i> – self-annihilation and immersion in the beloved.<sup>77</sup> In the eyes of the Sufi poets, this search for the God within liberated the seeker from the restrictions of narrowly orthodox Islam, encouraging the devotee to look beyond the letter of the law to its mystical essence. As Ghalib put it,</p>",

They were of the opinion that it was not right to pray in the mosques to which he was in the habit of going and which were under his patronage.'<sup>94</sup> Zafar's devotional attachment to Imam Ali was especially galling to the orthodox Sunni: the Shia festival of Muharram – the incarnation of Islamic heresy in the eyes of the resolutely Sunni Shah Waliullah – was celebrated with enthusiasm in the Palace, with Zafar listening to the <i>marsiya</i> mourning poems. Partly because of this there were persistent rumours that Zafar had actually converted to Shiism. This led to the Emperor receiving several outraged delegations from the Delhi '<i>ulama</i> threatening to take the ultimate sanction of excluding his name from the Friday prayers – effectively excommunicating him and delegitimising his rule – if the rumour ever proved true.<sup>95</sup></p>",

Shah Waliullah's theologian son Shah Abdul Aziz was a prolific giver of fatwas, or legal opinions, and it is significant how many of these concern economic matters – about the permissibility of letters of credit, or of gaining income through trade in slaves, and so on – which implies that many of those seeking his opinion were heavily involved in trade and commerce. It was certainly rich Punjabi Muslim traders who financed the radical madrasas of Delhi, especially those who called for jihad against the <i>kafirs</i> and who aimed to create an Islamic society pruned of all its non-Islamic accretions.<sup>96</sup></p>",
