## **3 AN UNEASY EQUILIBRIUM**

By 1852, although the British and the Mughals inhabited the same city and sometimes lived in close physical proximity to each other, the two peoples were growing farther and farther apart.

Where intermarriage – or at least cohabitation – was once very common among the small British community in Delhi, now there was virtual apartheid. There was less and less everyday contact, and still less attempt at mutual understanding. Nowhere was this more apparent than in Delhi's two leading journals; indeed, there is perhaps no better indication of the growing crevasse of misunderstanding opening up at this time between the British and Indian inhabitants of Delhi than a simple comparison of the columns of the two papers. If the *Dihli Urdu Akbhar* and the *Delhi Gazette* were in agreement about Padre Jennings' more extreme missionary activities, there were few other points on which the two saw eye to eye. Reading the newspapers' coverage of the events of 1852, there are times when it would be possible to believe that they were recording the news of two completely different cities.

The *Dihli Urdu Akbhar* officially regarded its job as being to encourage its readers to 'imbibe virtues and shun vices'.<sup>1</sup> Others took a different line: according to a rival Urdu newspaper, 'This is a dirty paper, full of personal gossip which attacks respectable people who do not share the religious views of the editor.'<sup>2</sup> Both apparently contradictory statements have their origin in the same tendency: the vigour with which the *Dihli Urdu Akbhar*, under its forthright Shia editor, Maulvi Muhammad Baqar, spoke out against corruption in the court, among the '*ulama*, and even in the British government.

While unwaveringly loyal to Zafar, the paper castigated the Palace administration for the corrupt way it delayed the disbursement of monthly stipends ('only those having access to the Emperor, the Mukhtar or the Royal Physician can get their salary paid') and gloated when some of the more badly behaved princes got their come-uppance – for example, when the raffish Mirza Shah Rukh was ambushed by the Delhi moneylenders as he made his way to the shrine of Qadam Sharif.<sup>3</sup> Wrongdoing the newspaper ascribed to the machinations of evil courtiers who were pulling the wool over the saintly Emperor's eyes.<sup>4</sup>

Maulvi Muhammad Baqar was a Delhi man, an alumnus of the Delhi College who had taught there for a while before leaving on account of the low salary. He had gone on to work briefly for the British, before setting up a lucrative bazaar for foreign merchants and building an *imambara*, a Shia religious hall, in which he sometimes preached.<sup>5</sup>

Reflecting his own interests, the concerns of the *Dihli Urdu Akbhar* centred mainly on local political and religious matters: it talked of the conversion of Master Ramchandra, described the latest miracles witnessed in the Sufi shrines, and reported on Delhi festivals, as well as the occasional fracas that occurred in them, such as Sunni-Shia riots during the Muharram of 1852. It also relayed such gossip as the punishment of yet more Palace serving girls for 'sexual vice'.<sup>6</sup>

Since Baqar's son, the promising young poet Muhammad Husain who wrote under the pen-name Azad, used to help his father with the paper, the *Dihli Urdu Akbhar* also took a strong interest in literary matters, reprinting the most acclaimed new ghazals recited in the *mushairas* and firmly siding with Baqar's friend – and Azad's *ustad* (guru) – Zauq in his rivalry with Ghalib: when the latter was arrested for gambling, the scandal was gleefully

covered by the *Akhbar*. If the paper made any reference to the world outside the walls of Delhi, it tended to be about the surrounding towns of Hindustan, and at a stretch Calcutta. Britain hardly appears in its columns – in the entire 1840s there were just seven mentions of the Company's home island, far fewer than there were about proper, civilised Muslim countries such as Egypt or Persia, where Baqar's family had originated.<sup>7</sup>

By contrast, the focus of the *Delhi Gazette* was that of the mistyeyed expatriate, eternally dreaming of the green hills around Cheltenham. There are a few references in its columns to the lighting of the canal in Chandni Chowk or to the ruts in the road near the *Gazette's* Kashmiri Gate offices.<sup>8</sup> There are also the occasional anxious mentions of 'most daring dacoitees', reports of sad defeats suffered by the Delhi Cricket Club at the hands of a Calcutta team, and the complete results from the Delhi Derby. These included the announcement of the annual Locomotive Race 'for all bonafide wheelbarrows, to be coached by the Band boys of the regiments, one Band boy to sit in each barrow, winner to receive Rs 8'.<sup>9</sup>

Very special events occasionally, briefly, bring the two diverging worlds of the British and the Mughals together. But while in the early days of the British ascendancy the British and Indians had tended to come together by mutually participating in the life and festivities of the Mughal court, by the 1850s this contact now tended to take place firmly on European terms: at the Delhi horse races, when the local nobility would descend on the town from their country estates to take part in the Mogul Cup,<sup>10</sup> or in the Delhi Freemasons' Lodge, which admitted Indian members.<sup>11</sup>

One such event was the arrival of Messrs Trood and Co., who brought their travelling exhibition to Delhi. This exhibition included several microscopes, which were reported by the *Delhi Gazette* to have caused 'great consternation among native gentlemen [at] the curiosities revealed to their wondering eyes'.<sup>12</sup> Another such occasion was the coming of Monsieur Jordain and his Travelling Circus:

The graceful riding and dancing of Madame Jordain called down repeated plaudits from the European portion of the audience, while the natives testified their delight with involuntary wah wahs. Monsieur Jordain astonished not only the natives, but all beholders, with feats of strength, while Monsieur Oliver's novel feat on the

ball, which he propelled round the circus, and up an inclined plane at the same time balancing himself on the summit … called forth well merited praise, as did also the performance of the obedient Pony Rajapack, who did all that he was told, and finished the evening by going to bed on a litter, and was thus carried off the ground.<sup>13</sup>

Yet the heart of the *Delhi Gazette*, like that of its readers, and indeed that of its restless editor, George Wagentrieber, was really elsewhere. There are frequent reports of the expansion of the British Empire – of the cannons fired to mark the end of the Second Anglo-Burmese war, the annexation of Pegu and the occupation of Rangoon; there are dispatches from the imperial front lines in the Crimea, Afghanistan and Persia. Most of all, however, the paper is full of news from home, of advertisements for comfortingly faux-English cottages in Simla and Mussoorie named Bridge View and Roseville, and for nice families in Sussex willing to take in children for an education so as to avoid their acquiring an Indian accent.<sup>14</sup> 'TO PARENTS AND GUARDIANS,' reads one advertisement. 'A Lady returning to England will be happy to obtain charge of a few children, and see them safe to their friends' destination on arrival.'<sup>15</sup> Another comes from 'a married clergyman residing on his living in a healthy part of Somersetshire, wishes to receive into his family one or two children … to share in the education of his own children, under his own charge. Terms from 60 guineas to 100 pounds.'<sup>16</sup>

This was a paper that knew exactly how to assuage the anxieties and nostalgia of impecunious exiles. But the people of Delhi, if they appear at all, are by the 1850s referred to only very occasionally, and then invariably with deep condescension, as 'natives' or 'our black bretherin'.<sup>17</sup> Wagentrieber's attitudes, however, were a little more complicated than these terms might indicate. For he was married to Elizabeth, the Anglo-Indian daughter of the famous James Skinner of Skinner's Horse, and a pillar of White Mughal society in Delhi.

James Skinner was the son of the Scottish mercenary Hercules Skinner, himself the son of the Provost of Montrose; his mother was a Rajputni, the daughter of a Rajput zamindar\* from 'the Bojepoor country'.<sup>18</sup> Having fought bravely for the Marathas, Skinner eventually found himself ejected

from their ranks because of his British father; later he fought for the English, only to be increasingly discriminated against by the East India Company because of his Indian blood: 'I imagined myself to be serving a people who had no prejudice against caste or colour,' he wrote in his memoirs. 'But I found myself to be mistaken.' His mixed inheritance was, he concluded, 'like a two-edged blade made to cut both ways against me'.<sup>19</sup> Skinner's services for the Mughal emperors led to him being given a title which his Montrose grandfather would have raised his eyebrows at: Nasir ud-Daulah Colonel James Skinner Bahadur Ghalib Jang, which the people of Delhi shortened to Sikandar Sahib, for the populace of the Mughal capital looked on him, it was said, as the reincarnation of Alexander the Great.

Skinner was a Christian who took his religion very seriously, and towards the end of his life he built St James's, the first church in Delhi,† and became a pillar of the Delhi Anglican community. This did not, however, prevent him from having a large number of *bibis* – 'there are any number of beautiful Mrs Skinners', wrote an impressed Fanny Eden,<sup>20</sup> fourteen according to one estimate<sup>21</sup> – and Skinner restored a beautiful Mughal mosque near his Delhi haveli for the Muslims among them, as well as (at least according to Delhi legend) building a temple for those who professed the Hindu faith. Fanny Eden described him as

a native colonel, very black [and] much better society than any of the white colonels we meet here, and who has done many warlike wonders. He is staying here and is a very fine old man. We went on Sunday to a large church he had built, and there is a mosque he has also built very near it. He told me that where is God, there is religion, but I suppose he calls himself a Musalman.<sup>22</sup>

Eden was wrong to make this assumption, but since Skinner lived in an entirely Mughal style, and his English was stilted and ungrammatical,<sup>23</sup> the mistake was understandable. His chief wife – who may well have been Wagentrieber's mother-in-law – was certainly Muslim: her name was Ashuri Khanam and she was a landowner in her own right, while her father, a powerful Haryana zamindar named Mirza Azim Beg, was Skinner's

administrator at the barracks of Skinner's irregular cavalry regiment at Hansi.<sup>24</sup>

After the death of Sikandar Sahib, his different children 'of all hues and colours' remained prominent landowners and courtiers in Delhi, trying with increasing difficulty to bridge the widening gap between the Mughal court and the British community, a task not made any easier by the eccentric dress sense of some members of the family. Even William Gardner could not help being amused by Sikandar's brother, Robert Skinner: 'a greater dandy than ever, and has more gold and silver chains around him than Baron Frank had in the Magdeburg Dungeon'.<sup>25</sup> Some of the Skinners clearly found being strung between two different worlds more of a strain than did others: at one point Theo Metcalfe reported to his sister Georgina (or GG, as everyone seems to have referred to her) that, 'Mr. J Skinner has been intoxicated for two months and 14 days without a lucid interval'.<sup>26</sup> Hence the complex undercurrents present in the piece that Wagentrieber published in the *Gazette* bidding a firm farewell to the era of the White Mughals, of whom his wife's own family were so prominent a part, and whose day Wagentrieber now clearly believed to be over. Whatever his feelings for his Skinner inlaws, Wagentrieber clearly thought he knew where the future lay, and which side to back.

It would not be long, however, before he would be very grateful for his connection to this 'thoroughly Indianized' family, and for his wife's dark skin colour, her fluency in Hindustani and her ability to carry off a sari – all things which for Wagentrieber, and maybe also his long-suffering wife, had up to now been a cause of mild but unmistakable embarrassment.

During the early 1850s, it sometimes seemed as if the British and the Mughals lived not only in different mental worlds, but almost in different time zones.

The British were the first up: in the cantonments to the north of the Delhi Civil Lines, the bugle sounded at 3.30 a.m., a time when the poetic

*mushairas* of the Mughals were still in full flow in the Red Fort, and while in the *kothis*\* of the courtesans in Chauri Bazaar the dancing and ghazal singing were drawing to a close, and the girls were progressing to the more intimate stage of their duties. As the Mughal poets and the courtesans raised their different tempos, sleepy, yawning Englishmen like Captain Robert Tytler, a fifty-year-old veteran of the 38th Native Infantry, or Lieutenant Harry Gambier, an eighteen-year-old Etonian newly arrived in India, would be sitting up in bed as their servants attempted to shave them and pull on their master's stockings.<sup>27</sup> A long session of drill in the cantonment parade ground lay ahead.

Two hours later, by the time the sun was beginning to rise over the Yamuna, and the poets, the courtesans and their patrons were all heading back to bed to sleep off their long nights, not only the soldiers but also the British civilians would be up and about and taking their exercise. A woman like Harriet Tytler, the brisk and no-nonsense wife of Robert, or the English community's great beauty, the lovely young Annie Forrest, to whom Harry Gambier was already writing politely admiring letters, would have been back from their morning rides round the cantonment: in order to protect a lady's complexion, it was not considered advisable to ride much after sunrise.<sup>28</sup>

By six, Harriet would be busy supervising her large staff of servants in her screen-darkened bungalow. The first task was preparing for the enormous breakfast without which no Englishman in Victorian India would consider starting his day: at the very least a selection of 'crumbled chops, brain cutlets, beef rissoles, devilled kidneys, whole spatchcocks, duck stews, Irish stews, mutton hashes, brawns of sheep's heads and trotters, not to mention an assortment of Indian dishes such as *jhal frazie*, prawn *dopiaza*, chicken *malai* and beef *Hussainee*. Added to this list were a number of Anglo-Indian concoctions such as kidney toast Madras style, Madras fritters, and leftover meat minced and refried with ginger and chillies'.<sup>29</sup> Then of course there was the ultimate Anglo-Indian breakfast dish of kedgeree, a perennial favourite, even though in Delhi it was considered most inadvisable to eat fish in high summer.\*

As the cantonment memsahibs awaited the return of their menfolk from the parade ground, inside the city walls Padre Jennings would be conducting the early morning service in the hush of St James's Church.

Soon the courts to one side of the graveyard would come to life too: the two chief magistrates, John Ross Hutchinson and Charles Le Bas, would already be in their offices, as would their assiduous assistant, Arthur Galloway, and the *Sadr Amin* Mufti Sadruddin, often known by his pen-name, Azurda. At the same time, riding in through Kashmiri Gate, Theo Metcalfe, the other joint magistrate, would be heading late towards his day's work, regretting that he had not prepared his briefs as thoroughly as he might have, and that he had not been up as early as his father, who had already conducted half his day's business, besides taking a swim, organising the household and reading the papers. George Wagentrieber would be up too. Having kissed his wife Elizabeth goodbye, he would now, like Theo, be heading down from the Civil Lines to the Kashmiri Gate offices of the *Delhi Gazette*, to begin his day of writing and proofreading the latest issue.

Among the people of Delhi, the poor woke long before the rich. As the sun rose, and as the British were returning from their morning rides and preparing for breakfast, up near the shrine of Qadam Sharif the first bird catchers were laying their nets and baiting them with millet, to catch the early birds out for their morning feed. Past them on the dusty road came the sellers of fruit and vegetables, some on bullock carts, most trudging on foot, streaming in from the villages of the Doab down the Alipore road, bringing their goods to the new suburb of Sabzi Mandi just outside the Kabul Gate, to the north-west of the city.

At the Raj Ghat Gate, the earlier-rising Hindu faithful – at this time of day women in their cotton saris far outnumbering the men – were streaming out to perform their *pujas* and have their morning bathe in the waters of the holy Yamuna before the crowds gathered and the dhobis appeared. Only the pandits kept them company this early in the morning: in small shrines lining the banks of the river up to Nigambodh Ghat, where according to Delhi legend the Vedas emerged from the waters, the bells were ringing now for the morning *Brahma Yagya*, celebrating the creating and re-creating of the world over and over again, morning after morning. As the differently pitched bells sounded against the Sanskrit chants, so in the dark of the inner sanctum the camphor lamps circled the images of Vishnu and the marigoldstrewn black-stone Shiva lingams.

From deep inside the city – from the Masjid Kashmiri Katra in the south to Fatehpuri Masjid in the west, to the great Jama Masjid itself and on through to the elegant riverside minarets of the Zinat ul-Masajid – the last

cries of the dawn *Azan* could now be heard, each call slightly out of time with the one before it, so that the successive cries of spiritual longing and assertion came to the listener on the riverbank in a series of rolling waves. In the silence that followed the end of the call to prayer, the songs of the first Delhi birds could suddenly be heard: the argumentative chuckle of the babblers, the sharp chatter of the mynahs, the alternating clucking and squealing of the rosy parakeets, the angry exclamations of the brain fever bird, and from deep inside the canopy of the fruit trees in Zafar's gardens at Raushanara Bagh and Tis Hazari, the woody hot-weather echo of the koel.

By now in the city itself, in the high-walled privacy of the courtyards of the grander houses like that of the young courtier Zahir Dehlavi in Matia Mahal, the servants were beginning to stir, throats were being cleared, and bamboo blinds were being rolled up to reveal water channels and fountains in the cloister gardens. Soon bolsters and sheets were being tidied away to leave the verandas of the courtyards free for breakfast – of mangoes or *aloo puri* for the Hindus, or perhaps some mutton *shorba* for the Muslims. Servants would draw water from wells, or head out to buy fresh melons from the Sabzi Mandi; in some of the richer houses coffee might be prepared. From the masculine side of the house came the first gurgle of the hookah. In the zenana, children were being dressed, *cholis, ghagras* and *angiyas* buttoned and laced, *peshwaz* and saris wrapped. In the kitchen the daily ritual of chopping onions, chillies and ginger would begin, and the chickpeas and *channa dal* set to soak; elsewhere, the different inhabitants of the zenana would begin their day praying, sewing, embroidering, cooking or playing.

Before long the older boys would be heading off down the lanes to arrive at the madrasas in time for the beginning of the day's study: to work on memorising the Koran by heart, or to hear an explication of its mysteries by the maulvi; or maybe it would be a day for studying the arts of philosophy, theology and rhetoric. Far from being a tedious chore, this was for many a thrilling business: one eager pupil who came to Delhi from a small town on the Grand Trunk Road used to go to the lectures at the Madrasa i-Rahimiyya even in the pouring monsoon rain, carrying his books in a pot in order to protect them from getting wet.<sup>30</sup> The elderly Zakaullah remembered running at breakneck speed through the *galis* of Shahjahanabad, such was his excitement at the new learning – and especially the mathematics – he was being taught at the Delhi College.

Even Colonel William Sleeman, famous for his suppression of the Thugs and a leading critic of the administration of the Indian courts, had to admit that the madrasa education given in Delhi was something quite remarkable: 'Perhaps there are few communities in the world among whom education is more generally diffused than among Muhammadans in India,' he wrote on a visit to the Mughal capital.

He who holds an office worth twenty rupees a month commonly gives his sons an education equal to that of a prime minister. They learn, through the medium of Arabic and Persian languages, what young men in our colleges learn through those of Greek and Latin – that is grammar, rhetoric, and logic. After his seven years of study, the young Muhammadan binds his turban upon a head almost as well filled with the things which appertain to these branches of knowledge as the young man raw from Oxford – he will talk as fluently about Socrates and Aristotle, Plato and Hippocrates, Galen and Avicenna; (alias Sokrat, Aristotalis, Alflatun, Bokrat, Jalinus and Bu Ali Sena); and, what is much to his advantage in India, the languages in which he has learnt what he knows are those which he most requires through life.<sup>31</sup>

The reputation of Delhi madrasas was certainly sufficient to inspire the young poet Altaf Husain Hali to flee his marriage in Panipat and walk the 53 miles to Delhi, alone and penniless and sleeping rough, in an attempt to realise his dream of studying in the famous colleges there: 'Everyone wanted me to look for a job,' he wrote later, 'but my passion for learning prevailed.'<sup>32</sup> Delhi was after all a celebrated intellectual centre, and in the early 1850s it was at the peak of its cultural vitality. It had six famous madrasas and at least four smaller ones, nine newspapers in Urdu and Persian, five intellectual journals published out of the Delhi College, innumerable printing presses and publishers, and no fewer than 130 Yunani doctors.<sup>33</sup> Here many of the new wonders uncovered by Western science were being translated for the first time into Arabic and Persian, and in the many colleges and madrasas the air of intellectual open mindedness and excitement was palpable.<sup>34</sup>

But the biggest draw of all were the poets and intellectuals, men such as Ghalib, Zauq, Sahbai and Azurda: 'By some good fortune', wrote Hali, 'there gathered at this time in the capital, Delhi, a band of men so talented that their meetings and assemblies recalled the days of Akbar and Shah Jahan.'<sup>35</sup> Hali's family tracked him down eventually, but before they found him, and hauled him back to married life in the mofussil (provinces), he was able to gain admittance in the 'very spacious and beautiful' madrasa of Husain Bakhsh and to begin his studies there: 'I saw with my own eyes this last brilliant glow of learning in Delhi,' he wrote in old age, 'the thought of which now makes my heart crack with regret.'<sup>36</sup>

Meanwhile, on Chandni Chowk, although Mr Beresford, the manager of the Delhi Bank, had been at work since 9 a.m., it was eleven o'clock before the first shopkeepers began turning up. They opened the shutters of their booths, fed their canaries and caged parakeets, and began fending off the first of the beggars and holy mendicants who bounced coins in their bowls as they passed up the gauntlet of shops. Some of these figures were well known and even revered Delhi characters, such as the *Majzub* (holy madman) Din Ali Shah: 'He is so careless about the affairs of this world', wrote Sayyid Ahmad Khan in a sketch of Delhi's most famous citizens, 'that he remains naked most of the time, and when surrounded by a crowd is likely to break out into intemperate language. But when the desirous seekers ponder over the words, they find that behind the outward senselessness there is a clear answer to their queries.'<sup>37</sup> Some of the most revered mendicants were women, such as Baiji, 'a woman of exceptional talent who spent all her life under a hay thatch near the Old Idgah of Shahjahanabad. While conversing she often quoted Quranic verses … whatever she had said would take place exactly as she predicted'.<sup>38</sup>

Out on the pavements, tradesmen too humble to have their own premises were now filling their appointed places: the ear cleaner with his pick and probe, the tooth cleaner with his bundles of neem twigs, the astrologer with his cards and his parrot, the quack with his lizards and bottles of murky aphrodisiac oils, the kabutarwallah with his fantails and fancy doves. Meanwhile, in their workshops off the main street frontage, away from the eyes of passers-by, the jewellers were preparing their emeralds and moonstones, topaz and diamonds, rubies from Burma, spinels from Badakshan and lapis from the Hindu Kush. Shoemakers took their cured leather and began curling the toes of their *juties* on the last; the swordmakers began lighting their forges; the cloth merchants pulled out their bolts of fabric; the spice merchants smoothed into shape their orange-gold mountains of turmeric.

In the largest premises of all, guarded by mace bearers, were the great Jain and Marwari moneylenders of Delhi with their family credit networks and groaning registers stuffed full of debtors' names, which included, after Mirza Jawan Bakht's wedding, Zafar himself. Down they slumped against their bolsters, dreaming of schemes for recovering the implausible sums of money they had so unwisely lent to the impecunious princes of the Red Fort – men like Lala Saligram, Bhawani Shankar and the richest of all, Lala Chunna Mal, the largest single investor in Mr Beresford's Delhi Bank, in his massive and opulent haveli in Katra Nil.<sup>39</sup>

Just as Chandni Chowk was waking up, 2 miles to the north, in the cantonment, the working day was already drawing to a close, and most of the soldierly duties were already completed. A bathe, a quick read of the papers and a game of billiards filled an hour or two, before the heat in the small brick bachelor bungalows became unbearable and all that remained to do until late afternoon was to sprawl around 'in loose dishabille, reading, lounging and sleeping'.<sup>40</sup> With little to occupy them most of the day, for many British soldiers boredom was the principal enemy they faced in India: 'My disgraceful laziness is appalling,' wrote Allen Johnson of the 5th Bengal Native Infantry in his diary around this time. 'I have hardly opened a book or written a line for the last ten days. In fact I have done absolutely nothing but lounge and saunter about, now taking up a book and gazing at it with a lack luster *[sic]* eye or kicking about restlessly in my bed. My only fixed idea have been yearnings for home and a detestation of natives and native things.'<sup>41</sup>

For Sir Thomas Metcalfe, a little to the south at the Residency offices of Ludlow Castle in the Civil Lines, the day's work was also nearly done: his various meetings were finished, the queries from the kotwal\* and courts were answered, his letters were written, and the news from the Palace had been studied, summarised and forwarded to Agra and Calcutta.

Soon after 1 p.m., as Sir Thomas was heading back to Metcalfe House in his carriage, his day's work completed, things were just beginning to stir in the Red Fort. Zafar was quite capable of rising early if a hunting expedition was in store, something he enjoyed well into his late seventies;\* but after a

*mushaira* (poetic symposium) or a *mehfil* (evening of courtly entertainment), he preferred to lie long abed. His day would begin with 'the arrival of the water women coming bearing a silver basin and silver water pots. They would spread a mat (made of either cloth or leather) and on it place the silver basin and the water pot. The female towel bearers would then come in carrying napkins to clean the Royal face and feet, and towels and handkerchiefs for cleaning the Royal nose'.<sup>42</sup>

Morning prayers would follow, after which Dr Chaman Lal was on hand to rub olive oil into Zafar's feet.<sup>43</sup> There had been calls from the '*ulama* for the doctor's dismissal after his conversion to Christianity, but Zafar had replied that the doctor's faith was his own private matter and 'there was no cause for shame in what he had done', so the doctor continued to give his daily ministrations at the Palace.<sup>44</sup> A light breakfast followed, eaten crosslegged on a sheet, during which the metre and rhyme pattern (*tarah*) for the evening's *mushaira* might be discussed. † Then Zafar would take a quick round of the Palace, escorted by his troupe of Abyssinian, Turkish and Tartar women guards, all of whom wore male military dress, and were armed with bows and a quiver of arrows.<sup>45</sup>

Afterwards, Zafar would attend to petitions; receive visits and gifts from his gardeners, shikaris and fishermen; administer justice to any more slave girls caught in flagrante or *salatin* caught stealing; and then receive his *ustad*, Zauq, who would help correct his latest verses. Occasionally he might also receive his own pupils for composition and help correct their verses: one March, for example, the court diary records him as taking 'A Khasburdar and a female – Piram Jan – as pupils in poetical composition.'\* <sup>46</sup> Certainly writing and correcting verses took up several hours of the Emperor's day: as Azad put it simply, Zafar 'was madly in love with poetry'.† 47

Meanwhile, elsewhere in his apartments within the Shah Burj tower on the river side of the Palace, Mirza Fakhru would be busy with his calligraphy, or writing his *History of the Kings and Prophets*, while his younger brothers would be beginning their schoolwork, something the Mughals took very seriously: 'All of them are kept continually at their studies and watched with great caution,' wrote one visitor. 'Few or no princes in India can vie with any of the royal persons [of Delhi] not only in

acquired qualifications but also in those qualities of the mind, generally the gift of nature, and consequent to a good and virtuous education.'<sup>48</sup>

A serious princely education at this period put great stress on the study of logic, philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, law and medicine. It was also expected, as in the courts of Renaissance Europe, that any truly civilised prince should be able to compose verse, and the *Garden of Poetry*, a biographical dictionary of Urdu poets produced in 1850, mentions no fewer than fifty members of Zafar's immediate family. Several of these are women, and Bishop Heber particularly noted the emphasis Zafar put on female education in the Palace.<sup>49</sup>

In his youth, Zafar was himself a good example of the sort of rounded Renaissance Man that a serious Mughal education sought to produce: he was fluent in Urdu, Arabic and Persian, but had also mastered Braj Basha and Punjabi sufficiently to write verse in both.\* <sup>50</sup> By the age of thirty-three he had already produced a volume of his collected poetry, a long verse-byverse commentary on Sa'adi's *Gulistan* (The Rose Garden), 'a three volume dictionary of prosody', and a treatise on the Deccani language. <sup>51</sup> He was also, in his youth, a renowned rider, swordsman and archer, and remained a crack shot with a rifle into old age.<sup>52</sup> Even Sir Thomas's chilly elder brother, Sir Charles, no fan of the Mughal court, had had to admit that Zafar 'was the most respectable and accomplished of the princes'.<sup>53</sup>

One Mughal prince who did not show the slightest interest in studying was Mirza Jawan Bakht. He frequently skipped lessons to go off by himself on a shooting expedition, not always with happy results: on one occasion, according to the Resident's court diary, 'it was reported that Mirza Jawan Bakht had fired a pistol at a pigeon and that two of the shot had lodged in a man's leg, who was bathing in the Yamuna. HM was much displeased and sent 6 rupees to the wounded man and directed Mahbub Ali Khan to send all the guns and pistols and tulwars [swords] in the Prince's possession to HM and that the Prince was to pursue his studies'.<sup>54</sup>

Breakfast in the Red Fort would often coincide with the light tiffin lunch served at 1 p.m. in the cantonment – a grilled fowl perhaps, modest in comparison to the gargantuan proportions of the Anglo-Indian breakfasts and dinners with which tiffin was flanked. Metcalfe House, however, as ever worked on its own routine, precisely set by Sir Thomas. Here dinner was served at the unusual time of 3 p.m., for Sir Thomas found this was

'conducive to his health', after which he read for a while in the Napoleon Gallery, before descending to the cool undercroft for a long solitary game of billiards, 'that was a great amusement to him and gave him the exercise he required', it also kept him occupied during the worst of the day's heat.<sup>55</sup>

For three hours, during seven months of the year, the Delhi afternoon heat emptied the streets, leaving them deserted: a blazing white midnight clearing the lanes and *galis*, and hushing the city into uncharacteristic silence. In the cantonments, the sweating young soldiers tossed and turned on their beds, shouting to the punkah-wallah outside to pull harder.

In the city, however, inside the cool shade of the courtyards of the highceilinged havelis, life would continue as normal: the *khas* screens made of fragrant grass would be soaked in scented water and then raised over the arcades of cusped arches; beautifully woven *shamianas* would be raised by ropes run through metal hoops in the projecting eves of the *baradan* pavilions. Those who had cool underground *tehkhanas* would retreat there, to continue uninterrupted the day's chores – sewing, letter writing and teaching the smaller children – and pleasures – smoking and playing cards, *pachchisi* and chess. One British traveller who was taken down to one of these subterranean catacombs was amazed at what he saw: 'So much is the temperature decreased', he wrote,

that twelve and even fourteen degrees have been discovered between the atmosphere of the Ty-Khouna, and the atmosphere of the room above ground, and seldom less than ten degrees … The descent to the apartment was about thirty feet, and the surprise and pleasure were equal, to find such beautiful rooms and so elegantly arranged and furnished. Coloured to resemble marble, the eye is at first deceived by the likeness; the deception is countenanced by the coolness, so different from the oppressive sensation always felt above. Long corridors lead to different apartments, embellished with coloured walls, and other decorations … many exquisite drawings of places of celebrity in Delhi and its neighbourhood add to the appearance of this fairy palace: light is admitted from above … a retreat of this kind in the hot months of April, May and June is a luxury scarcely to be described, when by every precaution possible to be taken, the thermometer above stairs can rarely be brought below eighty five; very often it is ninety …<sup>56</sup>

It was only towards late afternoon, around five o'clock, that things began to stir above ground and life returned to the Delhi streets. The *bhishtis* would be the first out, emptying their goatskins of water on the dust and chaff covering the roads; in their booths, the *paan* wallahs would begin preparing their betel leaves; the *kakkarwalah* or hookah man would begin roaming the dhabas; the opium shops would soon be doing good business too.\* In the Sufi shrines, the pace would also quicken, as the thin stream of afternoon devotees thickened to the crowds of evening, as the rose-petal sellers in the lanes near by woke from their squatting slumbers, and the qawwals with their tablas and harmoniums struck up the qawwalis: 'Allah hoo, Allah hoo, Allah hoo …'

In the Red Fort, for the *salatin*, this was the best time for practising archery, for quail, ram or cock fighting, and for falcon and pigeon flying.<sup>57</sup> In summer, some went swimming or fishing in the Yamuna just below the Palace, though this was not without its risks: one May, for example, the seventeen-year-old 'Mirza Kaus Shekoh was carried off by an alligator' only three weeks after celebrating his marriage with dancing and fireworks.58 In the monsoon there were kites to fly (for the men) and swings to enjoy (for the women). Zafar, meanwhile, was settling down to his favourite early evening occupation of watching his elephants being bathed in the river below his apartments, or 'looking at the fishermen at work'.<sup>59</sup>

This was followed by an evening of airing among the orange trees of the Palace gardens, sometimes on foot, but usually in a palanquin. <sup>60</sup> For the Mughals, gardens were regarded as reflections of paradise, and a connoisseurship of plants and scents was considered a central attribute of a civilised mind. As he passed, Zafar would inspect the gardeners at work, and give orders for 'mango grafts to [be sent to] the Hyatt Bakhsh Bagh', or orange saplings and 'plaintain grafts' to be arranged in groups in the New Garden that he had personally planned, and had planted, on the riverbank below his apartments.\* 61

Occasionally, when Zafar was feeling energetic, he would descend to the riverbank and go fishing, or spend the evening flying kites on the sand near Salimgarh.<sup>62</sup> Sometimes he would send for Ghalib to keep him company and entertain him, though Ghalib did not much enjoy being an attentive courtier and found the whole experience fatiguing. 'My friend,' he wrote to one correspondent in December 1856, 'I swear by your head [that after a

day of assiduous flattery at court] I lie down to sleep at night as exhausted as a labourer.'† 63

Up in the cantonments, some of the more officious colonels would order an evening parade; others would save themselves the bother and head straight for the mess. Meanwhile Theo Metcalfe, released from his magistrate's court, would be out riding on the riverbank north of Metcalfe House, with his dogs running beside him, and dreaming perhaps of winning a prize (and beating off the tough competition from the Skinners) at the annual North Indian Coursing Club Meet, of which his father was president. The club's annual competition for best puppy, held each winter, was an event of such central importance to the British community that the *Delhi Gazette* was known on occasion to give over a whole issue to it.<sup>64</sup> Sir Thomas, meanwhile, was sitting on his riverside terrace, looking forward to a quick evening meal and early bed. His terrace was his favourite place, and this time of day found him most relaxed. 'Three or four chairs were placed [around the terrace], and here he sat for a couple of hours till it was time to dress for dinner in the evening. It was the custom for his friends to come at this time to see and chat with him …'

As the sun set, the churches, mosques and temples filled again: the ringing of the bells of the evening *arti*, the final call to prayer from the minarets, and the basso profundo of the organ chords concluding Padre Jennings' evensong in St James's, all fusing together with the rumble of British carriages heading out towards the Civil Lines through the bottleneck of Kashmiri Gate – where the bricking up of the second of the two arches was a cause of frequent complaints in the *Delhi Gazette*. 65

As the gloaming thickened, the lights were lit in the Red Fort by a procession of torchbearers accompanied by tabors, trumpets and pipes, while out in the city the streets were filling with the Delhi College students and the madrasa boys returning in the half-light, exhausted from a day's hard study and memorising.<sup>66</sup> The two streams would rarely mingle, however. As Hali recalled many years later,

Although the old Delhi College was then in all its glory, I'd been brought up in a society that believed that learning was based only on knowledge of Arabic and Persian … nobody even thought about English education, and if people had any opinion about it at all it

was as a means of getting a government job, not of acquiring any kind of knowledge. On the contrary our religious teachers called the English schools barbarous<sup>67</sup>

For the English, sunset was the beginning of the end of the day. They had another vast meal to look forward to – more mulligatawny, 'an overgrown turkey (the fatter the better) … an enormous ham, at the top of the table an enormous sirloin or round of beef; at the bottom a saddle of mutton, legs of the same, boiled and roasted down the side, together with fowls, three in a dish, geese, ducks, tongues, humps, pigeon pies … mutton chops and chicken cutlets', devilled bones, and stews and curries of any game the sportsmen among them had shot during the day;\* but there was little to look forward to thereafter. <sup>68</sup> The French traveller Victor Jacquemont was particularly unimpressed by the after-dinner entertainments offered by the British society of Delhi: 'I have not seen the slightest exhibition of pleasure amongst the idlers at [Delhi] parties,' he wrote. 'None of the conditions which make a ball a pleasurable thing in Paris exist in the European community at Delhi.'<sup>69</sup>

It was certainly true that the British community in Delhi were an eccentric lot, even by the standards of Victorian expats. Emily Metcalfe was particularly struck by the Civil Surgeon, Dr Ross ('short and corpulent and very ugly … a shocking bad doctor'), whose three standard prescriptions were leeches, senna packed into dirty 'black beer bottles, and huge pills sent in a rough wooden box';<sup>70</sup> and Dr Alois Sprenger, the Principal of Delhi College, whose wife ('worthy but common', according to Emily) used to hide her husband's trousers to prevent his going out in the evening and leaving her alone.<sup>71</sup>

Certainly, the British in Delhi were always to some extent looking over their shoulder to the more Anglicised station of Meerut, which with its huge cantonment and large English community was famous for its theatre and its lavish regimental balls. But Delhi could boast almost none of that: 'There is little society here,' complained one junior Residency official, adding that after he had finished his court work he had little option but to take refuge in the company of his classical library: 'I have not quite forgot old Latin – Greek long since fled – but Livy, Tacitus or Caesar still now and then employ an hour agreeably – and Virgil & Horace often peeped into.'<sup>72</sup>

Theo Metcalfe, not one to waste time on classical studies, looked for other amusements. He tried his hand at after-dinner musicmaking with some of the ladies of the British community: 'I have joined the Philharmonic Society,' he told his sister GG in one letter, 'and pass a pleasant enough evening – the only apparent drawback to the harmony is the presence of the Gorgons. "Hell-in-er" looked at me the other day with green eyes, just like an angry dog, but could hardly have enjoyed herself for she was not spoken to the whole evening. Miss Forrest meanwhile is currently only being worshipped by 5 Lieutenants and 3 Ensigns. Mrs Balfour [the surgeon's wife] encourages them in a very indelicate manner.'<sup>73</sup> Theo's sister GG also enjoyed a musical evening, though in her case piano playing was often merely an excuse to see her fiancé Edward Campbell, whose style of singing – when she was honest with herself – she admitted was a little slow for her taste, much as she adored his fine tenor. 74

Theo also tried his hand at the Delhi Amateur Dramatics, taking parts in *Who's the Dope?* and *The Polka Mania* to raise money 'for the distressed of the Scotch Highlands and Islands', though according to the *Delhi Gazette* it was not he but 'Robin Roughhead as Jimmy [who] convulsed the house with laughter … the curtain fell with a hearty and well deserved applause'.<sup>75</sup>

None of this sort of thing was at all to the taste of Sir Thomas, who liked to be the first to bed: 'In the evening he only made a very light meal,' remembered his daughter Emily,

for it was his invariable custom to leave the dining room at eight o'clock in order to go to bed early. It used to be a great source of amusement… to watch his proceedings as soon as the 'retiring gun' fired and the clock struck eight. He immediately got up from the chair where he was smoking his hookah, said goodnight to everybody at the table, undid his neckcloth, threw it on the ground while he was walking to the door, unfastened his waistcoat buttons and then turned and gave a wave of his hand as he disappeared behind the curtain into his dressing room …<sup>76</sup>

For the people of Delhi, however, the best part of the day lay ahead. Chandni Chowk really came alive only after sunset, as the pavements

swelled with wide-eyed boys from the mofussil or Jat farmers and Gujar herdsmen in from their villages in Haryana, ogling the gamblers locked in the stocks outside the kotwal or heading off to ask for blessings and good fortune at the city's matrix of bustling Sufi shrines. Elsewhere could be seen gentlemen visiting from Lucknow in their distinctive cut of wide-bottomed pyjamas or tall, bearded Pathan horse traders fresh in from Peshawar and Ambala, spilling out of the sarais and into Ghantawallahs, the famous sweet shop, whose *laddus* were supposed to be the best in Hindustan. The coffee houses – the *qahwa khanas* – were filling up now too, with poets reciting their verses at some tables, scholars locked in debate at others.

On the steps of the Jama Masjid, the storytellers would be beginning their recitations, which could go on for seven or eight hours with only a short break. The most popular of all the tales was the *Dastan i-Amir Hamza*, a chivalrous epic romance which collected together a great miscellany of fireside yarns, legends, religious discourses and shaggy-dog stories which over time came to gather around the story of the travels of Hamza, the uncle of the Prophet. Any factual backbone the story might once have had was swamped over the centuries with a flood of subplots and a cast of dragons, giants, sorcerers, princesses and flying carpets, as well as flying pots, the preferred mode of travel for the magicians in *Hamza*.

In its fullest form, the tale grew to contain a massive twenty thousand separate stories, and would take several weeks of all-night storytelling to complete; the printed version filled forty-six volumes. As listeners gathered around the *Dastan-go*, who was telling of the handsome, courageous and chivalrous Hamza, his beautiful Persian princess lovers and Hamza's terrible nemesis, the cruel necromancer and arch-fiend Zumurrud Shah, at the other side of the steps Jani the celebrated kebab man would now be fanning his charcoal. Delhiwallahs used to like to surprise visitors from outside by taking them to eat there without telling them of 'the pot of hot chillis' with which Jani would marinate his kebabs. Maulvi Muhammad Baqar's son, the young poet Azad, told of one stranger to Delhi who 'hadn't eaten for a whole day. He stretched his jaws wide and fell on it [the kebab]. And instantly it was as if his brains had been blown out of his mouth by gunpowder. He leapt back with a howl. [But the Delhiwallah who brought him replied:] "we live here only for this sharp taste."'<sup>77</sup>

Zafar was also fond of a little chilli in his dinner, which he began to eat no earlier than 10.30 p.m., a time when most of the British were already

well tucked up in their beds. Quail stew, venison, lamb kidneys on sweet nan called *shir mal, yakhni*, fish kebabs, and meat stewed with oranges were Zafar's favourite dishes, though on festive occasions the Red Fort kitchens were capable of producing astonishingly varied and prodigious quantities of Mughlai cuisine: the *Bazm i-Akhir* describes a feast consisting of twenty-five varieties of bread, twenty-five different kinds of pilaos and biryanis, thirty-five different sorts of spiced stews and curries, and fifty different puddings, as well as remarkable varieties of relishes and pickles, all eaten to the sound of singers performing ghazals, while the fragrance of musk, saffron, sandalwood and rosewater filled the air. 78

Whatever the dish, Zafar was known to like his food heavily spiced – and he was most upset when his friend, prime minister and personal physician, Hakim Ahsanullah Khan, banned him from eating 'cayenne pepper' in August 1852, following a series of digestive disorders.79 Another of Zafar's great pleasures, mango jam, was also forbidden by the hakim, who said that Zafar's excessive indulgence in it gave him diarrhoea. When Zafar continued to ignore his advice and then suffered from a bad stomach, the hakim 'was very annoyed and replied that if the King would act in this way he had better dismiss him at once. HM excused himself and promised greater abstinence in future'.<sup>80</sup>

For Ghalib, the late evening was also the time for indulging in mangorelated pleasures, especially the exquisitely small, sweet *chausa* mango, a taste he shared with many other discerning Delhiwallahs, past and present. At one gathering, a group of Delhi intellectuals were discussing what qualities a good mango should have: 'In my view,' said Ghalib, 'there are only two essential points about mangoes – they should be sweet and they should be plentiful.'<sup>81</sup> In his old age he became worried about his declining appetite for his favourite fruit and wrote to a friend to express his anxieties. He never ate an evening meal, he told his correspondent; instead, on hot summer nights he would 'sit down to eat the mangoes when my food was fully digested, and I tell you bluntly, I would eat them until my belly was bloated and I could hardly breathe. Even now I eat them at the same time of day, but not more than ten or twelve, or if they are of the large kind, only six or seven'.\* 82

There was one other great pleasure that Ghalib reserved for the cover of darkness. 'There are seventeen bottles of good wine in the pantry,' he wrote

to one friend, describing his idea of perfection. 'So I read all day and drink all night.'<sup>83</sup>

As Ghalib was finishing his mangoes and looking forward to his bottle of wine,† as the exhausted labourers were heading home to their villages before the *muhalla* gates were locked for the night, and as Saligram and the moneylenders began finally shutting up their shops in Chandni Chowk, so in the Fort dinner was drawing to a close. This was the signal for Zafar's hookah to be brought and the evening's entertainment to begin. This could take a number of forms: ghazals from Tanras Khan; the instrumental playing of a group of sarangi players, or the court storytellers and troupes of the Fort's dancing girls. Most celebrated of all was Himmat Khan, Zafar's famous blind sitar player: 'Nobody could come close to him in Dhrupad,' thought Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan.

If [Akbar's great musician] Tansen were still alive, he would have humbly become a disciple … Rulers and notables from all corners pleaded with him to join their service and offered him lots of money and riches, but he refused to budge from Delhi out of that selfcontainment and self-contentment that is the particular preserve of Men of Art. Any singer who arrived in Shahajahanabad claiming distinction in the art would forget their *sur* and *taal* [note and beat] after hearing only one bar of his music and would accept the dust of his feet as the decoration of their eye … His inner pain and the joy of holy wisdom suffused the singing of this extraordinary and notably self-effacing genius.<sup>84</sup>

On other occasions, when Zafar felt the need for some peace, one of his great pleasures was to play chess while waiting for the new moon to come up. At other times he is described as simply sitting after dinner and 'enjoying the moonlight'.<sup>85</sup>

If Zafar wanted an early night – which meant one that ended around midnight – singers might be admitted to his bedchamber, where they would sing behind screens, while his masseuses worked on his head and feet, and the Abyssinian guards took their place at his door. <sup>86</sup> In 1852, after the disgrace of Tanras Khan, Zafar's preferred serenader was the woman referred to simply as 'Khanam the Singer'.<sup>87</sup> Sometimes it is clear that such

singers came out from behind the bedroom screens: one of Zafar's last marriages was to a singing girl named Man Bai, who became known as Akhtar Mahal following her wedding in 1847, when Zafar was seventy-two.

On such nights, when Zafar retired relatively early, many of the princes would head out into the town as things began to wind down in the Fort. Some might have assignations in the *kothis* of the Chauri Bazaar, where lights and the movement of dancing could be seen from behind the lattices of the upper floors, and the sounds of tabla and singing could be heard from as far away as Chandni Chowk. 'The women deck themselves in finery,' noted one visitor, 'and position themselves at vantage points to attract the attention of men, either directly or through pimps. An atmosphere of lust and debauchery prevails here and the people gather at night and indulge themselves.'<sup>88</sup>

The beauty and coquettishness of Delhi's courtesans were famous: people still talked of the celebrated courtesan Ad Begum of a century earlier, who would famously turn up stark naked at parties, but so cleverly painted that no one would notice: 'she decorates her legs with beautiful drawings in the style of pyjamas instead of actually wearing them; in place of the cuffs she draws flowers and petals in ink exactly as is found in the finest cloth of Rum'. Her great rival, Nur Bai, was said to be so popular that every night the elephants of the great Mughal *umrah* completely blocked the narrow lanes outside her house, yet even the most senior nobles had 'to send a large sum of money to have her admit them … whoever gets enamoured of her gets sucked into the whirlpool of her demands and brings ruin in on his house… but the pleasure of her company can only be had as long as one is in possession of riches to bestow on her'.<sup>89</sup>

Nevertheless, in 1852, at the height of the career of Zauq and Ghalib, the biggest draw was not the courtesans but the *mushairas* of the poets, especially those held in the courtyard of the old Delhi College just outside Ajmeri Gate, or in the house of Mufti Sadruddin Azurda.

Farhatullah Baig's *Dehli ki akhri shama* (The Last Musha'irah of Delhi) is a fictionalised but well-informed account of what purports to be one of the last great *mushairas* held in Zafar's Delhi. Around the illuminated courtyard of the haveli of Mubarak Begum, the widowed *bibi* of Sir David Ochterlony, sit several poet-princes of the royal house, as well as forty other Delhi poets, including Azurda, Momin, Zauq, Azad, Dagh, Sahbai, Shefta, Mir, a celebrated wrestler named Yal and Ghalib himself. There was also a

last White Mughal, Alex Heatherly, 'one of the great poets of the Urdu language', according to one critic,<sup>90</sup> who was related to the Skinners and so a cousin of Elizabeth Wagentrieber.

The courtyard has been filled so as to raise it to the level of the plinth of the house. On the wooden planks were spread cotton rugs. There was a profusion of chandeliers, candelabra, wall lamps, hanging lamps and Chinese lanterns so that the house was converted into a veritable dome of light… From the centre of the roof were hung row upon row of jasmine garlands … the whole house was fragrant with musk, amber and aloes … Arranged in a row, at short intervals along the carpet, were the huqqas, burnished and brightly polished …

The seating pattern was arranged so that those assigned places on the right of the presiding poet had connections with the Lucknow court, and on the left were seated the Delhi masters and their pupils. All those who came from the fort held quails in their hand as the craze for quail and cock fighting was very strong at that time …<sup>91</sup>

The often extremely complex metre and rhyme patterns would be set well in advance; many of the participants would know each other well, and a spirit of friendly competition would be encouraged. The hookahs would be passed around, as would paan and sweets. Then the president – in this case Mirza Fakhru – would say the *Bismillah*.

At this proclamation there would be pin-drop silence. The guests from the court put away their quails in their quail pouches and disposed of them behind the bolsters. The servants removed the water pipes and in their place put down spittoons [for betel chewers], the *khasdans* with betel leaf and trays with aromatic spices in front of each guest. In the meantime the personal representative of the king arrived from the court with the king's ghazal, accompanied by several heralds … He sought permission to read the ghazal. Mirza Fakhru nodded his assent …

From this point the poets began their recitation, passing couplets backwards and forwards, half singing, half reciting, applauding and wah-wah-ing those they admired for their witty or subtle nuances, leaving those less accomplished to sink in leaden silence. The versifying would continue until dawn, when it would be the turn of Zauq and Ghalib to bring the night to its climax. But long before that, from the north, would come the distant sound of the morning bugle. Two miles away, in the British cantonments, a very different day was beginning.

In 1852, the British and Mughals found themselves in an uneasy equilibrium: at once opposed yet in balance, living lives in parallel. Despite the tension over who was to be heir apparent, and Zinat Mahal's refusal to accept the succession of Mirza Fakhru, between the Palace and the Residency a temporary truce was maintained.

This balance was, however, broken most dramatically in 1853, by a series of deaths. By the end of that year all three British officials who had signed the succession agreement with Mirza Fakhru were dead, all in suspicious circumstances. The most suspicious – a straightforward case of poisoning, according to the doctors who attended him – was the slow and lingering death of Sir Thomas Metcalfe.
