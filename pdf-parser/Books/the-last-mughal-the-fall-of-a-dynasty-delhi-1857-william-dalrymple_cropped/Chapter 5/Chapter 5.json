There was less and less everyday contact, and still less attempt at mutual understanding. Nowhere was this more apparent than in Delhi's two leading journals; indeed, there is perhaps no better indication of the growing crevasse of misunderstanding opening up at this time between the British and Indian inhabitants of Delhi than a simple comparison of the columns of the two papers. If the <i>Dihli Urdu Akbhar</i> and the <i>Delhi Gazette</i> were in agreement about Padre Jennings' more extreme missionary activities, there were few other points on which the two saw eye to eye. Reading the newspapers' coverage of the events of 1852, there are times when it would be possible to believe that they were recording the news of two completely different cities.</p>",

Even William Gardner could not help being amused by Sikandar's brother, Robert Skinner: 'a greater dandy than ever, and has more gold and silver chains around him than Baron Frank had in the Magdeburg Dungeon'.<sup>25</sup> Some of the Skinners clearly found being strung between two different worlds more of a strain than did others: at one point Theo Metcalfe reported to his sister Georgina (or GG, as everyone seems to have referred to her) that, 'Mr. J Skinner has been intoxicated for two months and 14 days without a lucid interval'.<sup>26</sup> Hence the complex undercurrents present in the piece that Wagentrieber published in the <i>Gazette</i> bidding a firm farewell to the era of the White Mughals, of whom his wife's own family were so prominent a part, and whose day Wagentrieber now clearly believed to be over. Whatever his feelings for his Skinner inlaws, Wagentrieber clearly thought he knew where the future lay, and which side to back.</p>",

Soon bolsters and sheets were being tidied away to leave the verandas of the courtyards free for breakfast – of mangoes or <i>aloo</i> <i>puri</i> for the Hindus, or perhaps some mutton <i>shorba</i> for the Muslims. Servants would draw water from wells, or head out to buy fresh melons from the Sabzi Mandi; in some of the richer houses coffee might be prepared. From the masculine side of the house came the first gurgle of the hookah. In the zenana, children were being dressed, <i>cholis, ghagras</i> and <i>angiyas</i> buttoned and laced, <i>peshwaz</i> and saris wrapped. In the kitchen the daily ritual of chopping onions, chillies and ginger would begin, and the chickpeas and <i>channa dal</i> set to soak; elsewhere, the different inhabitants of the zenana would begin their day praying, sewing, embroidering, cooking or playing.</p>",

He never ate an evening meal, he told his correspondent; instead, on hot summer nights he would 'sit down to eat the mangoes when my food was fully digested, and I tell you bluntly, I would eat them until my belly was bloated and I could hardly breathe.
