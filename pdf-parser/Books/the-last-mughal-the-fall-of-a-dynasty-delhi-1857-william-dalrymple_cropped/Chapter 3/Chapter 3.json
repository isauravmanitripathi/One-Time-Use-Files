Despite his height and surprisingly broad and muscular build, there is a profound gentleness and sensitivity in his large brown watery eyes with their unusually long lashes. As a teenage prince, Zafar had always appeared in his portraits as a slightly awkward and uncertain figure, plump, visibly ill at ease and thinly bearded. But as youth gave way to middle age he had grown into his looks, and in old age – unusually – looked finer than ever. Now in his mid-seventies, his cheeks were sallow, his nose more pronounced and his bearing more regal. Yet as the elderly monarch kneels, wearily fingering his beads, there remains in the expression of his dark eyes something unmistakably melancholic; in the set of his full lips there is still that air of sad, patient resignation visible in the earlier pictures. Schoefft shows Zafar a little swamped under the brocade cloth of gold which adorns him, somewhat weighed down by the huge blood-coloured rubies and the strings of vast pearls, each the size of a partridge egg, which seem to hang so heavily around his neck. It is a portrait of a man imprisoned by the trappings of his office.</p>",

In 1852, British additions within the walls of Delhi were limited to a domed church, a classical Residency building recently converted into the Delhi College, and a strongly fortified magazine, all of which stood to the north of the Fort and out of sight of the path of the procession. Moreover, there were still relatively few Europeans in Delhi – probably well under a hundred within the walls: as the poet and literary critic Azad later put it, 'those were the days when if a European was seen in Delhi, people considered him an extraordinary sample of God's handiwork, and pointed him out to each other: \"Look, there goes a European!\"'<sup>14</sup></p>",

Henceforth, more and more of the Mughal's rights and privileges were stripped away, until by 1852 Zafar was left with nothing but his palace and the lingering reputation of his dynasty.</p>",

In the days of my lusty youth a man of perfect wisdom counselled me, 'Abstinence I do not approve: dissoluteness I do not forbid. Eat drink and be merry. But remember that the wise fly settles on the sugar and not on the honey.' Well I have always acted on his counsel. You cannot mourn another's death, unless you live yourself …Give thanks to God for your freedom, and do not grieve …When I think of paradise and consider how if my sins are forgiven me and I am installed in a palace with a houri, to live forever in the worthy woman's company, I am filled with dismay and fear …How wearisome to find her there – a greater burden than a man could bear. The same old palace, all of emerald made; the same fruit tree to cast its shade. And – God preserve her from all harm – the same old houri on my arm. Come to your sense, brother, and take another.</p>",

Most critics today would argue that it was a well-justified boast, but at the time it was taken to be a slight not just to Zauq, but also to Zafar, who was of course a considerable poet himself, and who had expressed his belief in the superiority of Zauq's talents when he appointed the latter to correct his own verses. Zafar quickly made his views apparent, presenting to Zauq a <i>khilat</i> and the honorary position of Superintendent of the Palace Gardens, while ostentatiously neglecting to provide an honour of any sort for Ghalib.<sup>37</sup> Zafar also encouraged Zauq to reply to Ghalib's unprovoked sally. The fine <i>sehra</i> that the Poet Laureate came up with ended with a couplet tossing the challenge back to Ghalib:</p>",

Whatever his other qualities, running the domestic arrangements of the Red Fort was clearly not one of Zafar's talents, at least in his old age.</p>",

But the options open for the junior <i>salatin</i>, or Palace-born princes and princesses, could be extremely limited. Besides the senior princes, there were over two thousand poor princes and princesses – grandchildren and greatgrandchildren and great-great-grandchildren of previous monarchs – most of whom lived a life of poverty in their own walled quarter of the Palace, to the south-west of the area occupied by Zafar and his immediate family. 45 This was the darker side of the life of the Red Fort, and its greatest embarrassment; for this reason many of the <i>salatin</i> were never allowed out of the gates of the Fort, least of all on so ostentatious an occasion as the very public festivities in Daryaganj.

The latter had strived instead for the succession of Zafar's raffish younger brother Mirza Jahangir, and in the process developed so strong an objection to his eldest son that on 21 March 1807 he wrote a letter to the then British Resident, Archibald Seton, which closely prefigured that written by Bahadur Shah about Mirza Fakhru forty-two years later: 'My eldest son [i.e. Zafar]', wrote Akbar Shah, 'is wholly devoid of every qualification for occupying the throne.' He also accused him, without giving any evidence or details, 'of an offence against nature too delicate to admit explanation from us'.*</p>",

It was in the end a successful campaign. After much negotiation, Mirza Fakhru met with Metcalfe and the Lieutenant Governor in January 1852, three months before the wedding, and signed a secret understanding: the British agreed formally to recognise him as heir apparent, contrary to his father's wish; but there was a quid pro quo. After more than two centuries, Mirza Fakhru would move the court from the Red Fort to the distant suburb of Mehrauli, handing over the old fort of Shah Jahan to the British, who would use it as a barrack and a powder magazine; and when he became Emperor, Fakhru would drop the Mughal's long-standing claim of superior status to the British Governor General, and would henceforth meet him on terms of equality. 53</p>",

He abandoned his plan to go on the haj and threw himself into making arrangements for the wedding of Jawan Bakht. He seems to have believed – or to have been persuaded by Zinat Mahal – that if the wedding were made sufficiently magnificent, such would be the prestige of the bridegroom that the British might yet be forced to take Zafar's choice of successor seriously. Certainly contemporaries assumed that the magnificent wedding was Zafar's last-ditch attempt at persuading Metcalfe to recognise Jawan Bakht, and it did result in the <i>Delhi Gazette</i> openly referring to the young groom as the heir apparent.<sup>58</sup></p>",

In reality, however, he seems to have had slightly more exalted ambitions, and to some extent he set up his establishment as a rival court to that of Zafar, with the Metcalfes as a parallel dynasty to the Mughals. Metcalfe House, also known as Jahan Numa ('World Showing'), his expansive and palatial Palladian bungalow on the banks of the Yamuna to the north of the city, was an indirect challenge to the Red Fort, a little downstream of it. If the Red Fort had its marble domes, its scented night gardens with their bubbling irrigation runnels and floating pavilions, then Metcalfe House had its flower beds with its English blooms, its marble columns and its swimming pool, its cypress avenues and orange groves, a library of 25,000 books, fine oil paintings and rosewood Georgian furniture.</p>",

Metcalfe had the images bound into an album, entitled <i>The Dehlie Book</i>, and wrote a long descriptive text as an accompaniment. This in due course he sent to his daughter Emily as she made her way home from an English schooling to join her father in Delhi. He also commissioned a remarkable panoramic scroll of the city, some 20 feet long. Together the two commissions remain the most complete visual picture of pre-Mutiny Delhi now extant.<sup>65</sup></p>",

Politically, they both had a faint sense that they had somehow been passed over: however grandly Metcalfe might swagger through the <i>muhallas</i> of Delhi, the truth was that many of Metcalfe's juniors had long since shot past him in the Company's service: John Lawrence, for example, once one of Metcalfe's assistants, had now risen several ranks above him and was Governor of the newly conquered Punjab. More galling still, Metcalfe's elder brother Charles, who had preceded him as Resident in Delhi, had now acquired a peerage and been promoted from acting Governor General in Calcutta to actual Governor General in Canada. Thomas Metcalfe, meanwhile, remained firmly ensconced in his old position in Delhi. It was a good but hardly very senior position in the Company's civil service, despite Delhi's long history as the capital of Hindustan and the centre of the Mughal Empire. This was especially so after 1833 when the new Presidency of the North West Provinces was created, administered by a lieutenant governor based in Agra, so further reducing the authority of the Delhi Resident.*</p>",

If Zafar increasingly found himself at odds with his eldest son and heir, then so too did Metcalfe. For Metcalfe's son Theophilus (or Theo as he was known), a junior magistrate in the Company's service, newly returned to India after ten years' absence at school in England, was a very different figure from his father. Where Sir Thomas was reserved and particular, Theo was sociable and expansive and also, when he wished to be, extremely charming. If the father liked solitude and disliked the business of entertaining, Theo was noisy and convivial, and enjoyed parties, riding, horses and dogs. If his father was resolutely selfdisciplined and law-abiding, Theo had a tendency to cut corners, and get into what his father described as 'scrapes'.<sup>66</sup> It was hardly surprising, therefore, that the two had a somewhat strained relationship.</p>",
