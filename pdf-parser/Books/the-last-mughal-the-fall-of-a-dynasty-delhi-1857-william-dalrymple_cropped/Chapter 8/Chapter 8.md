## **6 THIS DAY OF RUIN AND RIOT**

At four o'clock on the day of the outbreak, Charles Todd's two assistant telegraph operators, Brendish and Pilkington, closed up their office and set off to flee to safety, first to the Flagstaff Tower, and then on to Meerut.

Before they did so, however, they tapped out two SOS messages in Morse code, and sent them to the Commander-in-Chief and the cantonments on the Punjab and the Frontier. Original transcriptions of both still survive in the Punjab Archives in Lahore. The first, sent some time around midday, was the fuller of the two: 'Cantonment in a state of siege,' it read.

Mutineers from Meerut 3rd Light Cavalry number not known said to be one hundred and fifty men cut off communication with Meerut. Taken possession of the Bridge of Boats. 54th NI sent against them but would not act. Several officers killed and wounded. City in a state of considerable excitement. Troops sent down but nothing certain yet.

The second was sent just before the two operators ran off: 'We must leave office,' they tapped. 'All the bungalows are being burned down by the sepoys of Meerut. They came in this morning. We are off. Mr C Todd is dead we think. He went out this morning and has not returned."<sup>1</sup>

It was a dramatic vindication of the new technology of the telegraph – something that Ghalib considered one of the miracles of the age. The messages reached Ambala, and within hours had been forwarded to Lahore, Peshawar and Simla.

Relaxing in the cool of the Himalayan summer capital, the Commanderin-Chief, General George Anson, received the message at breakfast on Tuesday morning after an express rider had carried the telegram up the winding mountain track overnight. Anson, who had not seen active service since Waterloo more than forty years earlier, did not seem to realise the seriousness of what was happening, just as he had earlier dismissed the significance of the greased cartridges.<sup>2</sup> The following evening one of his advisers, Colonel Keith Young, recorded in his diary that 'he appears rather to pooh-pooh the [whole] thing. We shall see'. Two days later, with the Commander-in-Chief still stuck immobile in Simla, even Anson's most loyal friends were beginning to be anxious at his response. 'The Chief is blamed,' wrote Young's wife in a letter.

He has not been trained as a soldier and seems unable to grasp the importance of the situation. When he first received the bad news on Tuesday morning he should have started off at once. Colonel Becher, Quartermaster-General, did his utmost to persuade him not to lose any time: but he said, *no*; he would wait for the *dak* [post]. What is the use of the electric telegraph if the news it brings is not at once to be attended to?<sup>3</sup>

When Anson finally got as far as Ambala, four days later, on the 15th, it was discovered that logistical problems meant that his force could proceed no farther: as part of some cost-cutting exercise, the army's baggage camels had recently been sold. Now the contractors could not be found to move the three European regiments that had gathered in Ambala – already known as the Delhi Field Force – even one step on towards their destination.

There were other problems too. None of the regiments initially had any ammunition beyond the twenty rounds they kept in their pouches, since the promised supplies had failed to materialise from Simla. Moreover, the baggage of at least one regiment had been lost between the hills and Ambala, leaving the soldiers with nothing but two white jackets and a pair of trousers each.<sup>4</sup> Worse still, Anson had refused to heed the warnings of his staff immediately to disarm the clearly disaffected sepoy regiments stationed in Ambala, with the result that they shortly afterwards broke out into mutiny too, and took off to Delhi down the Grand Trunk Road with all their arms intact. 'Oh my dear mother,' wrote the young second lieutenant Fred Roberts.

You would not believe that Englishmen could be guilty of such imbecility as has almost invariably been displayed during this crisis … Perfectly ridiculous, an army going to pieces in this way … You would scarcely believe how paralysed everything is. We have a most dilatory undecided Commander-in-Chief.<sup>5</sup>

But it was not just the fault of Anson. Similar logistical problems had been behind the failure of the European regiments in Meerut to follow the mutineers to Delhi: on 12 May, two days after the Meerut outbreak, General Archdale Wilson, one of the two station commanders, wrote to his wife to admit that 'we have no power to move having no cattle only 15 elephants, and a few bullocks'.<sup>6</sup> Wilson's colleague General Hewitt was less effective still. As Wilson himself wrote, '[Hewitt] is a dreadful old fool and thinks of nothing but preserving his own old carcass from harm.'<sup>7</sup>

For ten days the troops in Ambala found themselves marooned, immobile in the terrible heat at the foot of the hills; meanwhile, cholera slowly took hold, the beginning of a plague that would eventually be responsible for nearly as many deaths as the bullets of the insurgents. 'The stench was awful,' remembered Richard Barter, a young lieutenant from the 75th Gordon Highlanders.

The dead bodies of three or four of the men who had just been carried off by the dreadful scourge were lying near rolled up in their *rezais* [quilts]. The heat was terrific, not a breath of air stirred the

leaves, and there we sat among the dead and the dying, whose groans resounded through the still air under the trees.<sup>8</sup>

It was not until the night of 24 May – a full thirteen days after the outbreak – that Anson and his Field Force finally set off towards the Mughal capital from Ambala – only for the Commander-in-Chief himself to die of cholera on the night of the 27th, soon after arriving in Karnal. By that time, partially because of the lack of any effective response by the British, mutinies had broken out amongst sepoy regiments stationed at Nowshera in the North West Frontier; Ambala, Philour and Ferozepur in the Punjab; Nasirabad in Rajputana; and in the North West Provinces at Hansi, Hissar, Moradabad, Agra, Aligarh, Etawah, Mainpuri and as far south-east as Etah to the east of Agra.<sup>9</sup>

Seen on the map, the outbreaks seemed to ripple outwards in concentric circles from Delhi. The Emperor, Bahadur Shah II, and his revived Mughal Empire were now acting as a focus for all the disparate hopes and aspirations of the many disaffected individuals, groups and causes, both Muslim and Hindu, across northern India, and it was to Delhi that almost all the mutinous troops headed once they had risen against their British masters. To the surprise of the British, not all the mutinous troops rose violently; instead

without molesting or even insulting their English officers they … quietly but firmly announced that they had released themselves from the service of the East India Company, and were about to become enrolled as subjects of the King of Delhi. Then, in several instances even saluting their officers and showing them every mark of respect, they turned their faces to the great focus of the rebellion, to swell the number of those who were about to fight against us in the Mohammedan capital of Hindustan.<sup>10</sup>

For this reason, the future of both Mughal and British rule now hinged very largely on what happened at Delhi: 'The fate of all India depends on our success,' wrote Fred Roberts to his mother soon afterwards as the Delhi Field Force began rumbling slowly south along the Grand Trunk Road. 'Were a failure to be the result, God only knows what would take place.'<sup>11</sup>

Luckily for the British, not all their commanders had proved as slow and ineffective as Anson, Wilson and Hewitt.

In Lahore, the headquarters of the Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, the energetic Sir John Lawrence, four disaffected Indian regiments were quickly disarmed on the morning of 13 May, as twelve loaded and primed cannon manned by British artillerymen faced them across the parade ground. The night before, a regimental ball had gone ahead as planned, so as not to make the sepoys suspicious: 'The evening passed off very pleasantly,' noted one officer in his journal, 'a perfect sham of smiles over tears. Half the ladies were not present, and those that were there could barely disguise their anxiety.'<sup>12</sup>

Meanwhile, farther to the north-west in Peshawar, two of the most militantly Evangelical officials in India, Herbert Edwardes and John Nicholson, met to discuss strategy as soon as the telegrams from Delhi arrived there on the night of 11 May. Their solution was to form a strong Moveable Column of mainly irregular troops able to overawe and terrorise the Punjab into submission. 'It should take the field at once,' wrote Edwardes to John Lawrence on 12 May. 'This disaffection will never be talked down. It must be put down – and the sooner blood be let, the less of it will suffice."<sup>13</sup> Lawrence agreed; within four days the Moveable Column had been formed in Jhelum, ready to move rapidly in any direction and crush rebellion against the Company wherever it broke out.<sup>14</sup>

Nicholson had some other, more bloodthirsty ideas too, which he did not convey to his superior, but communicated a little later to Edwardes when further details of the Delhi massacres had emerged. He proposed that they jointly put forward 'a Bill for the flaying alive, impalement, or burning of the murderers of the [British] women and children of Delhi … The idea of simply hanging the perpetrators of such atrocities is maddening … I will not, if I can help it, see fiends of that stamp let off with a simple hanging'. When Edwardes refused to be drawn on Nicholson's idea, Nicholson said he would propose the idea alone if Edwardes would not help him:

As regards torturing the murderers of women and children, if it be right otherwise I do not think we should refrain from it simply because it is a native custom … we are told in the Bible that stripes shall be meted out according to faults, and, if hanging is sufficient punishment for such wretches, it is too severe for ordinary mutineers. If I had them in my power today, I would inflict the most excruciating tortures I could think of on them with a perfectly easy conscience.<sup>15</sup>

John Lawrence was by no means averse in principle to strong measures. A former deputy of Sir Thomas Metcalfe in Delhi, he had risen rapidly in the ranks of the Company's civil service thanks to his reputation for hard work and efficiency. He forbade his officers from going up to the hills for the hot weather, and made known his disapproval of '"a cakey man" by which he meant someone who, besides presumably liking cakes, "pretended to much elegance and refinement" '.<sup>16</sup> When he heard that one of his junior officials had brought a piano to his Punjab bungalow, Lawrence spat, 'I'll smash his piano for him' and had him 'moved five times from one end of the Punjab to the other in the course of five years'.<sup>17</sup> As one of Lawrence's longsuffering officials remarked on hearing this story:

I had brought from Calcutta a handsome dinner-service, and I was strongly advised not to let the fact be known lest I, too, should be kicked about from one place to another till it was all smashed … He [Lawrence] was a rough, coarse man … [whose] ideal of a district officer was a hard active man in boots and breeches, who almost lived in the saddle, worked all day and nearly all night, ate and drank when and where he could, had no family ties, no wife or children to hamper him, and whose whole establishment consisted of a camp bed, an odd table and chair or so, and a small box of clothes such as could be slung on a camel.<sup>18</sup>

John Nicholson fitted this description perfectly. Even so, the two had a tense relationship, for Nicholson was not a man given to taking orders – and less still criticism – from anyone. One young officer described him as

a commanding presence, some six feet, two inches in height, with a long black beard, dark grey eyes with black pupils which under excitement would dilate like a tiger's, [and] a colourless face over which no smile ever passed … A stern sense of duty had made Nicholson expunge the word 'mercy' from his vocabulary … [and] he had the reputation as the best swordsman in India.<sup>19</sup>

A taciturn and self-contained Ulster Protestant, it was said that while he was District Commissioner in Rawalpindi, Nicholson had personally decapitated a local robber chieftain, then kept the man's head on his desk as a memento.<sup>20</sup> He was, moreover, a man of few words; one typical note in the archives is a letter to Lawrence which reads, in full: 'Sir, I have the honour to inform you that I have just shot a man who came to kill me. Your Obedient Servant, John Nicholson.' For reasons that remain unclear, Nicholson inspired an entire religious sect, the *Nikal Seyn*\* who apparently regarded him as an incarnation of Vishnu. Nicholson tolerated his devotees as long as they kept quiet; but if 'they prostrated themselves or began chanting they were taken away and whipped'. The punishment never varied: 'three dozen lashes with the cat-o'-nine-tails'.<sup>21</sup>

Despite – or maybe partly because of – this inexplicable adoration, Nicholson loathed India with a passion ('I dislike India and its inhabitants more every day') and regarded only the Afghans as worse ('the most vicious and blood thirsty race in existence').<sup>22</sup> These views he had already formed before he was captured and imprisoned during the disaster of the 1842 Afghan War. By the time he was released, only to discover his younger brother's dead body, with his genitalia cut off and stuffed in his mouth, his feelings about Afghans – and indeed Indians and Muslims of any nationality – were confirmed: he felt, he said, merely 'an intense feeling of hatred'.<sup>23</sup> Only his wish to spread the Christian Empire of the British in this heathen wilderness kept him in the East. Indeed his survival amidst the carnage of the Afghan War left him with a near-messianic sense of destiny: if the God of Hosts had saved him when so many other Christians Soldiers had been killed, it must be for some higher purpose of Providence.

Partly as a result of this messianic streak, Nicholson needed careful handling at the best of times, and the frank and forthright Lawrence was not necessarily the best man for the job. The previous year, after Lawrence

'insulted' Nicholson by giving him a mixed-race Anglo-Indian subordinate, Nicholson's response was to threaten to murder Lawrence, or, as he put it, 'commit justifiable homicide … Individuals have their rights as well as nations', as he wrote to Edwardes,

and as an individual I have as good a *casus belli* against Lawrence, as England as a nation, had against Persia or China … I consider that he *humiliates* me in the eyes of the whole Punjab … I am sure there would be less injustice and oppression in the world, if men similarly circumstanced took their redress into their own hands, more frequently … As for 'praying for grace to forgive him,' I *can't* do it, it would be rank hypocrisy uttering the words while so different a feeling was in my heart.<sup>24</sup>

Nicholson may have been, as one observer put it, 'the very incarnation of violence', yet his near-psychopathic temperament was ideally suited to the crisis in hand. Where the Ansons and Wilsons dallied and hesitated, Nicholson immediately began marching and countermarching, disarming regiments of sepoys, putting down mutinies, then hanging their leaders – he abandoned the practice of blowing mutineers from the mouths of cannon, in the time-honoured Mughal fashion, not out of compassion, but because he believed 'that the powder so expended might be more usefully employed'.<sup>25</sup> His actions quickly became the source of Victorian legend, and as his own letters and dispatches are the only source for many of his actions it is difficult to tease out the truth from the myth: it was said that he never slept and knew no fear; that he stormed almost single-handed the fortress of Attock; cut up several regiments of mutinous sepoys with only a small body of Pathan irregulars; and on one occasion he actually cleaved a man in two with a single sword stroke, merely remarking afterwards 'not a bad silver, that'.<sup>26</sup> He took no prisoners. One officer who was part of Nicholson's Moveable Column overheard the following exchange:

'Jack, the General is here.' 'How do you know?' 'Why, look there; there's his mark!'

The 'there' the fellow-soldier was told to look at was a pair of gallows, each of which was adorned with six hanging mutineers, while close-by were several bullock-carts, all filled with sepoys who had revolted, and who were waiting for their turn … Few court martials were held by Nicholson.

When Sir John Lawrence wrote to him asking for 'a return of courtsmartial, held upon insurgent natives, with a list of various punishments inflicted', the implacable Nicholson simply sent back the dispatch, having written on the back 'THE PUNISHMENT FOR MUTINY IS DEATH'.<sup>27</sup>

On the journey to Delhi, he continued to monitor security. One hot summer night in the middle of May, a group of hungry British officers attached to Nicholson's Moveable Column were sitting in a mess tent near Jalandhar waiting for their dinner. The food had been expected an hour before, but a messenger sent to the cooking tent returned with the information that it would be served a little late. Eventually the tall, craggy Nicholson strode in, and coughed to attract the attention of the company: 'I am sorry gentlemen to have kept you waiting for your dinner,' he apologised, 'but I have been hanging your cooks.'

According to Nicholson, he had discovered through his spies that the regimental cooks had just laced his brother officers' soup with aconite. He first invited the cooks to taste the soup, then, when they refused, force-fed the hot liquid to an unfortunate monkey. It writhed for a few seconds, then expired. Within minutes, as one of the officers present put it, 'our regimental cooks were ornamenting a neighbouring tree'.<sup>28</sup>

![](_page_8_Picture_4.jpeg)

One other British soldier of a similar temperament also rose to prominence during this uncertain period.

Prior to 1857, William Hodson had been regarded by most of his colleagues as a black sheep. Hodson was the bright son of a clergyman, and unlike most of his army contemporaries in India, he had a university

education behind him, at Trinity College, Cambridge. But according to his clergyman brother, books had a tendency to give Hodson headaches, and he was much more interested in his vocation as 'a Christian soldier'.<sup>29</sup>

One acquaintance described him as 'a tallish man with yellow hair, a pale, smooth face, heavy moustache, and large, restless, rather unforgiving eyes'.<sup>30</sup> Others talked of his impulsive, even reckless nature, and his skills as a 'perfect swordsman'. Having arrived in India in time to fight in the Sikh Wars, he had risen rapidly to be a District Commissioner in Amritsar, before heading to the North West Frontier to take up a position as Acting Deputy Commissioner of the Yusufzai tribal area, and adjutant of the new Corps of Guides. His fall from grace was equally sudden. In 1854 Hodson was relieved of his command after an investigation declared that he had misused and embezzled regimental funds, and had been guilty of corruption and falsification of the accounts, as well as gross negligence. 'My ruin is absolute and complete,' he wrote at the time.<sup>31</sup>

He was later acquitted of all the charges, but gossip continued to circulate about him – concerning the improper imprisonment without trial of a Yusufzai chieftain and his twelve-year-old-son, as well as the suspicious killing of a moneylender who was believed to have lent money to him.<sup>32</sup> It was said that he was conducting personal vendettas against 'the greater part of his Pathans and Afridis'; he was also personally unpopular with his men.<sup>33</sup> As a result, he continued to carry with him an extremely dubious reputation, and many agreed with the surgeon Edward Hare that he was too unscrupulous to be a good soldier and was really 'fit only to lead Italian banditti'. Shortly before the outbreak of the Uprising, on 21 March, his former patron, John Lawrence's elder brother Henry, effectively washed his hands of him, writing, 'I doubt if any man could help you just now.'<sup>34</sup>

At the outbreak, Hodson was still pressing for a formal, public inquiry to exonerate him of all the accusations ranged against him. But as with Nicholson's unstoppable rise in the face of the new crisis, Hodson's energy, ruthlessness and sheer brazen confidence brought him quickly to the attention of the Commander-in-Chief, and before long he had become the star of Anson's staff. Within five days of the outbreak he was appointed Assistant Quartermaster General, and was permitted to recruit his own small private army of Sikh Irregular horse 'for service in the intelligence department and as a personal escort'. A few days later, while Hodson was in

Karnal scouting ahead of the main army – where he shared his lodgings with a group of Delhi refugees including Annie Jennings' fiancé, Charlie Thomason, and the entire Wagentrieber family – news came from Anson that Hodson's force was to be expanded into an entire new regiment of irregular cavalry, under his own name, Hodson's Horse.<sup>35</sup>

One of Hodson's first duties was to ride through the turbulent countryside to Meerut, with a small escort of Sikh cavalry, and reestablish communication with the regiments stranded there. This Hodson did with a remarkable ride, setting off at nine o'clock at night on 21 May, reaching Meerut at dawn the following day. He delivered his message to Wilson (having found the other general, Hewitt, 'in a state of helpless imbecility'), had a bath, breakfast and two hours' sleep, and then headed straight back to Karnal, having to fight his way through the last 30 miles. He reached Anson at Ambala on the 23rd, a journey of 250 miles in two days at the height of the summer heat. That night he headed back yet again to Karnal: 'as I have only had one night in bed out of five I am tolerable weary', he wrote to his wife the following evening.<sup>36</sup>

Like Nicholson, Hodson soon gained a reputation for dispensing with legal niceties, especially with any mutinous sepoys he captured: 'There is a tendency to treat these rebellious sepoys with a tenderness as misplaced as it would be pernicious,' he wrote to his wife on 16 May. A little later he was more explicit: 'I never let my men take prisoners,' he explained, 'but shoot them at once.'<sup>37</sup> He was also notorious for the pleasure he took in the kill. 'A beautiful swordsman, he never failed to kill his man,' wrote one of his officers. 'The way he used to play with the most brave and furious of these rebels was perfect. I fancy I see him now, smiling, laughing, parrying most fearful blows, as calmly as if he was brushing off flies, calling out all the time, "Why, try again now," "what's that?" "Do you call yourself a swordsman?" &c … If only there was a good hard scrimmage he was as happy as a king.'<sup>38</sup>

Less dramatically, but ultimately more significantly, Hodson proved himself a ruthlessly efficient Chief of Intelligence: 'He even used to know what the rebels had for dinner,' noted one admiring officer. <sup>39</sup> On the march to Delhi, Hodson recruited as his principal assistant a one-eyed maulvi named Rajab Ali, who had previously worked as the Head Munshi of Sir

George Clerk, the Political Agent for the Sikh States, then later with Sir Henry Lawrence across the Punjab.<sup>40</sup>

Rajab Ali immediately made his way into Delhi, where he set up an extensive network of spies and informants, ranging from leading Hindu bankers and Anglophile Mughal aristocrats, through former British officials, to one of Wagentrieber's former subeditors at the *Delhi Gazette*. Most remarkably of all he managed to enlist as an informant one of the most prominent sepoy commanders, Brigade Major Gauri Shankar Sukul of the Haryana Regiment, who provided a regular stream of vital strategic information, as well as acting as agent provocateur, disrupting sepoy councils by accusing several other quite innocent (and often very prominent) sepoy officers of spying and collaboration. Rajab Ali also quickly established contact with Zinat Mahal; with Zafar's prime minister, Hakim Ahsanullah Khan; and with the pro-British faction in the Palace led by Mirza Fakhru's Anglophile father-in-law, Mirza Ilahe Bakhsh.

The centre of Hodson's spy network in the city was the Residency's corpulent Mir Munshi, Jiwan Lal, who, despite being confined to the dark of his *tehkhana* (underground cool room), soon became the most important British intelligence operator within the walls. Every day he sent out 'two Brahmins and two Jats for the purpose of obtaining news of the doings of the rebels from every quarter, from the Fort, the city gates, &c, so that I might record everything for the information of my masters'.<sup>41</sup> According to Jiwan Lal's own diary, as early as 19 May he received instructions to stay in the city and gather intelligence from a blue-eyed European 'disguised as a faquir'.

The man wore a *kurtah* of *gairwa* [reddish] colour such as is worn by Hindu Faquirs, called 'sadhs', had a bead of Tulsi around his neck, and on his forehead was painted a 'Ramanandi' mark. Only his eyes were blue … He also had some yellowish paint, such as of 'peori' over his face; and he told me that he had lived for a long time at Benares, and had acquired a thorough knowledge of Sanskrit and Urdu, so that no one could detect him in his speech … He sat for two hours talking about and describing his own account, and about the ignorance and stupidity of the rebels.

He took out from the folds of his *dhoti* – a long one, which he was wearing like Brahmins – letters … with instructions that I was

desired to forward to the chiefs of Jhujjur, Bahadurgarh and Bullubgarh … He advised me [to stay in the city] … furnishing such news of the rebels as might be of use to the government. 'And,' added he, 'our own men will be coming to you for the purpose of carrying away the news from you.'

The great difficulty was that all persons passing by roads or through the city gates were minutely searched by the rebels who did not leave even trousers and shoes unsearched. If anything was found the man was put to death. If it was discovered he was a messenger, the sender's house was plundered, and no mercy was shown to the sender's life. But I sent the letters … through my own servants disguised as beggars, promising them very liberal rewards for the service …\* 42

Thousands of notes from such spies – many of which were carried out of the city through a network of runners masquerading as sadhus and mendicants – still survive in the Mutiny Papers of the National Archives of India. They range from long and detailed analyses of the rebel positions – the gun emplacements, barracks, water supplies, regimental magazines and armouries – and the rebels' problems: from the lack of percussion caps, for example, to the squabbles and disagreements between the different sepoy regiments. They include many tiny fragments of papers designed to be sewn into shoes and clothing, and written in microscopic script, giving warning of imminent attacks and telling when and where they should be expected. They also give advice about how to improve the effectiveness of shelling, how to exploit the weak spots in the fortifications and how to damage the Bridge of Boats.<sup>43</sup>

Not all of the material proved either reliable or accurate; frequently the spies exaggerated the scale of the despair and disaffection within the city, and told their British paymasters what they wanted to hear – as Hodson and his fellow British intelligence officers quickly came to realise. But in the months to come, the sheer quantity of intelligence that the British received from the city, and the lack of it in the rebels' camp, did as much as anything to determine the outcome of the struggle for Delhi. As the senior city policeman, Sa'id Mubarak Shah, later put it, 'The fact was that the rebel army possessed no really trustworthy information as to the number and

position of the British troops. Nor had they a single spy on whose word they could rely.'<sup>44</sup>

By the beginning of the first week in June, Hodson was leading the Delhi Field Force as it lumbered south along the Grand Trunk Road from Karnal towards Delhi. Its new commander, the sixty-year-old General Sir Henry Barnard, had taken the advice of Sir John Lawrence: 'Act at once, march with any body of European troops to the spot, and the danger will disappear. Give it time, it will flame through the land.'<sup>45</sup> At his disposal Barnard now had a modest force of around 600 cavalry and 2,400 infantry, supported by a small siege train of around fifty cannon and field guns.

Hodson and his irregular cavalry travelled ahead of the main column, scouting ahead to anticipate ambushes; on one occasion Hodson rode up as far as the Delhi Race Course, above the burnedout cantonments, before meeting any rebel sentries.<sup>46</sup> Nicholson, meanwhile, was busy in the Frontier, gathering Sikh and Pathan levies of irregular horse to help replace the Hindustani troops lost to the Mutiny.\*

It would not be long before Hodson and Nicholson would together bring the full weight of British vengefulness to the very gates of Bahadur Shah's newly independent Mughal Delhi.

Zafar marked the afternoon of 12 May by mounting a procession. Processing around Delhi had always been Zafar's favourite and most effective means of ceremonially proclaiming and asserting his sovereignty; and on 12 May that sovereignty badly needed proclaiming.

As on the previous day, the streets of Delhi were empty but for gangs of looters: 'Things were still so bad that bands of plunderers were carrying empty sacks and were pillaging houses of any respectable citizen they could get into,' wrote Zahir Dehlavi.

They picked the houses of the rich and instigated rioters by saying that there is a memsahib hiding inside this house, or there are sahibs

in that one. Hearing this, mobs of rioters stormed into the house, led by the sepoys, and before long the city rabble could be seen leaving the ruins with all their collected booty. 47

Several of the leading Mughal aristocrats were manhandled, and had their premises ransacked. These included Hamid Ali Khan, the powerful leader of Delhi's Shia community, who was accused of sheltering Europeans and dragged to the court, where Zafar had to intervene to save him from execution.<sup>48</sup> Large areas of the city were still burning from the fires started the day before, while the Fort now contained so many sepoys, who placed their own guards at the Palace gates, that, according to Maulvi Muhammad Baqar, 'the Palace now resembles a cantonment'.<sup>49</sup>

The jewellers, moneylending *baniyas* and the famous cloth merchants in the Chota Dariba bore the brunt of the violence. So did Delhi's celebrated sweetmeat makers, whose fame had obviously reached Avadh and Bihar, as, according to the news-writer Chunni Lal, 'the infantry troops forcibly entered and plundered the shops of the confectioners in all the streets of the city'.<sup>50</sup> The moneylender Mahajan Narayan Das had his house looted and its entire contents removed. A jeweller named Mohan Lal was kidnapped by the sepoys and kept at gunpoint until he bought his way out of trouble by giving them 200 rupees.<sup>51</sup>

The courtesans were also vulnerable: several *kothis* found themselves besieged by crowds of soldiers, and at least one courtesan was abducted: the dancer Manglo, who was carried off and raped by the *sawar* Rustam Khan.<sup>52</sup> Sometimes the Delhiwallahs fought back: 'The infantry and cavalry made an attack on Nagar Seth street with the view to plundering it,' recorded Chunni Lal. 'But the inhabitants closed the gates and attacked the soldiery with brickbats, and drove them off.'<sup>53</sup> In other places too the townspeople took the law into their own hands: in Hauz Qazi, for example, there was a riot 'between some Tilangas and the residents of the Mohalla'.<sup>54</sup>

Occasionally the mob would find some last group of surviving Christians and drag them from their hiding place to the kotwal, where they were duly dispatched; among those killed on the morning of the 12th was the scholarly principal of Delhi College, Francis Taylor, who was discovered trying to escape in disguise, and was at once promptly beaten to death in the street. A little later, Elizabeth Wagentrieber's alcoholic cousin,

Joseph Skinner, was taken from his haveli and lynched at the kotwali; Skinner's house was then comprehensively looted. Many victims remain unnamed: one typical account in the narrative of Chunni Lal records how

four European gentlemen were concealed in the house of Muhammad Ibrahim, son of Muhammad Ali, merchant. The troopers hearing this went there, and killing the Europeans, plundered the house. A European woman, dressed as a native, was going along near Ellenborough Tank, and was killed by the troopers … Two European gentlemen going along in the guise of natives were killed in front of the principal police station.<sup>55</sup>

As far as Maulvi Muhammad Baqar was concerned, there was something miraculous in the ease with which the British were being dispatched: 'Englishmen are still being discovered,' he wrote in the *Dihli Urdu Akbhar*, 'and, thanks to divine prowess, being easily overpowered: their arrogance has brought them divine retribution. The English are now suffering under the blows of the unseen power because of their enmity towards Islam and their support for efforts to destroy the Islamic faith.'<sup>56</sup>

Other than the targeting of Christians, there was surprisingly little patriotic or nationalistic spirit visible in the violence that rumbled on for weeks after the outbreak: the initial mutiny in the army had opened a vast Pandora's box of differences and grievances – economic, sectarian, religious and political – and now that the violence and settling of scores had begun, it would not be easy to bring them to a halt. In the meantime, many of the sepoys simply took the opportunity presented by the breakdown of law and order to enrich themselves, as did many Delhiwallahs.<sup>57</sup>

Judging by the petitions that poured in to the King, many of which survive among the Mutiny Papers, the worst affected were the ordinary people of Delhi who did not even have the partial protection of gates or high haveli walls. The poor proved especially vulnerable outside the city, in suburbs such as Kishenganj and Nizamuddin. There the inhabitants found themselves at the mercy not only of the incoming sepoys, but also of mobs of Gujars from the surrounding countryside. One of the largest delegations to come before Zafar and beg for protection in the first days of the Uprising arrived from the western suburb of Paharganj. The language they used to

the Emperor was full of the old Mughal titles – Zafar was addressed as the Throne of the Caliphate and the Refuge of the Inhabitants of the World – but the petition that was presented demonstrated the reality of the utter helplessness of his regime:

We poor folk, residents of Jaisinghpura and Shahganj, also known as Paharganj, have come together to the Luminous Presence, because from days of old our settlement was attached to the Royal Estate, yet now the Tilangas come out from Ajmeri Gate and oppress the shopkeepers, and take goods by force without paying anything. The troops enter the houses of the poor and penniless and take anything they find – even the string beds, dishes and piles of firewood. Whenever your humble servants, or even our most respected citizens, go to the Tilangas and plead with them about the misery to which they have been reduced, they merely threaten them with their guns and swords. We have been reduced to such extremities by the depredations of the troops that we submit this petition to His Majesty that He may turn his gaze of justice and commiseration towards us. Send a Royal Order to the Tilangas that they give no more trouble, and that with the support of our gracious sovereign we may be left to live our lives in peace. May the sun of prosperity and success and all glory shine brightly, for your sake, O Lord of All!<sup>58</sup>

Another large delegation came to the Fort from the city's provision merchants and corn chandlers, who complained that, while seizing all their stocks, the troops had paid 'not one pice and have threatened and beaten up all the merchants'.<sup>59</sup> The inability of the Emperor to aid any of these petitioners was made startlingly clear by the fact that special orders had to be given to protect even the traders of the Chatta Chowk, the bazaar within the walls of the Red Fort, 'and if any Telinga disobeys, his officers should immediately report him'.<sup>60</sup> The sepoys also looted the King's own ice factory outside Ajmeri Gate, pointlessly destroying the Fort's stocks of ice.<sup>61</sup> Even the *harkaras*, the royal messengers, complained that they were being attacked by the Tilingas: 'they come to our houses, make trouble and loot their contents'.<sup>62</sup>

The position in the countryside outside the city was even worse: when Zafar sent some riders to seek troops and support from the Raja of Alwar, Gujars attacked them on the road just outside Mehrauli; they returned naked and bruised, reporting that the Gujars had 'robbed them of their horses, clothes and money; that they had taken the King's letter and, tearing it up, had put the pieces back into their hands'.<sup>63</sup>

Hoping to stop the looting and bring the city back to normality, Zafar called some of the leading men of his court to the Palace and discussed what could be done. He received them sitting on a silver throne that had been in storage ever since the ceremony of receiving *nazrs* from the Governor General had been stopped in 1842; now it was brought out, given a polish and installed in the Diwan i-Khas.

With few other options open, the court decided that the Emperor should go out on elephant-back, with Mirza Jawan Bakht seated behind him, 'accompanied by a regiment of infantry, some guns, his own special armed retainers, and a band of musicians', through the deserted, looted and smoking city, in an attempt to bring peace to the streets. By the beat of the drum, the royal proclamation was read through the bazaars that 'the country had reverted to the possession of the King', that Zafar had reclaimed the supreme authority that was always his by right, that the looting must now stop and the shops must reopen for business. In addition, Prince Mirza Mughal 'went to all the principal police stations, seated on an elephant, and had a proclamation made that anyone convicted of plunder would be punished with the loss of nose and ears'.<sup>64</sup>

A salute of twenty-one guns was fired on Zafar's departure from the Palace, and another on his return. Yet the procession proved very different from those Zafar was used to mounting, in which the cavalcade would stop for his subjects to come forward to present symbolic offerings of fealty to the Emperor. Instead,

from house to house the King was distracted by cries and petitions, now from servants of Europeans who had been murdered, now from shopkeepers whose shops had been plundered, now from the higher classes whose houses had been broken into – all looked to the King for immediate redress. Everywhere appeals were made to him to repress the plunder and rapine common throughout the city<sup>65</sup>

That evening Zafar summoned a general durbar and 'in a Persian *rubakari* [order] beautiful with flowing language' called on all the subahdars of the different sepoy regiments to rein in the bad behaviour of their troops, saying 'that such a state of things was most unbecoming' now that the rule of the Mughals had returned, a dynasty 'at whose feet all other kings and monarchs waited on bended knee'.<sup>66</sup> The officers listened politely enough, but within an hour other companies of sepoys appeared complaining loudly they could get no food in the town, that the grain shops refused to open, and bluntly telling the Emperor to find something for them to eat.

Forgetful of the lofty tone of the order, and of the high toned phraseology expressive of the King's dignity, they addressed him with such disrespectful terms as, 'I say, you King!' 'I say, you old fellow!' ('Arey, Badshah! Arey, Buddha!') 'Listen,' cried one, catching him by the hand. 'Listen to me,' said another, touching the old king's beard. Angered at their behaviour, yet unable to prevent their insolence, he found relief alone in bewailing his misfortunes and his fate before his servants …

Throughout this eventful day he was distraught, perplexed and cowed at finding himself in a position which made him the mere puppet of those who had formerly been only too glad humbly to obey his orders, but who now, taking advantage of the spirit of insubordination which was rife in all classes of the city in this day of ruin and riot, were not ashamed to mock and humiliate him<sup>67</sup>

If Zafar was in many ways an ideal monarch for the conditions imposed on him by the British before the Uprising, able from a position of virtual house arrest to act as host and part-catalyst for a major cultural renaissance, it was rapidly becoming clear that he was too old, mystical and other-worldly even to begin to fit the role of a leader in war. He was after all eighty-two years old, and lacked any of the energy, ambition and worldliness, and indeed the drive and determination, needed to ride the tiger of rebellion.

Instead his position was so weak that he was not even able to stop the sepoys from turning his Hall of Public Audience, the Diwan i-Am, into an ammunition store and dormitory for the artillery, or to prevent the rebel guards on the ramparts from peering constantly into his zenana quarters, as

frequent petitions from his angry begums bear witness. Less still was he able to prevent the damage that was done to his beloved gardens. For much of May he pressed to get the cavalry to remove their horses from his garden, but all without success.<sup>68</sup>

![](_page_19_Picture_1.jpeg)

The following morning, the 13th, Zafar again tried to bring some order to his city. While surveying the damage done the day before, he realised the urgent need to put out the many fires that were still burning, especially around the gutted magazine; after all, many of the houses of Delhi were built of little more than mud and thatch, and even the grander houses had wooden balconies and latticework projections.

It was Zahir Dehlavi who volunteered to go to the kotwal and attempt to gather the manpower necessary to extinguish the fires. 'I thought that if, God forbid, the remaining gunpowder catches fire, then before long the whole town will be ablaze,' Zahir wrote afterwards.

The *Kotwal* sent two or three hundred water carriers, and himself came along to help, so together we put out the fires which were burning, both in the magazine and houses around the town. It was just as well we acted when we did. Inside the magazine, on the side of the river, there were mountains of coal and gunpowder, as well as about two hundred cannons loaded and ready to fire. There was no count of the number of rifles lying scattered around, as well as innumerable pistols. Within two or three days I was told that the rabble had carried away the powder, guns and cannon, and only the cannon balls were left.

For us courtiers these were dangerous days. We Royal servants had the dagger of fate hanging over our heads at all times, and every so often I used to be surrounded by rebels who would put a pistol on my chest. One day [soon after the outbreak] twenty or twenty-five of us were sitting in the storehouse of the Fort along with Hakim Ahsanullah Khan, when the *Purbias* came and

surrounded us. They pulled out their guns and said, 'You infidels! You are all closet Christians! We know you are writing letters to the English …' We were shocked and told them that if this was true, why didn't they just shoot us there and then – at least we would be done with the anxiety of living from day to day under such pressure. One or two of the officers among them were sensible and were able to pacify the others. They were persuaded to leave us, but we were all frightened out of our wits.

Zahir writes how every day three or four hundred more sepoys came to join the men who had collected in Delhi until gradually seven or eight thousand had collected from all over Hindustan.

They were living in luxury, drinking a lot of *bhang*, \* eating the best *laddoo peras* [sweetmeats] and had stopped doing their own cooking, as for both meals they fed on delicious *puri kachoris* and sweets, and at night slept a peaceful sleep … They took control of Delhi and did what ever they wanted: there was no one who we could appeal to. It was like *andher nagri chaupat raj* [the proverbial city of darkness with an incompetent ruler].

The ordinary people of Delhi quickly tired of the uncertainties and were all praying God to rid them of this unexpected cataclysm and that power should be restored in the hands of rulers who would look after them. Meanwhile the rebel sepoys and the city mob were daily getting richer, looting whomever they wished. So rich did some of them become that soon they did not have enough space to keep their loot. They changed rupees for gold coins and had them tied to their belts. Meanwhile the ordinary people of Delhi were beginning to die of starvation, all the factories were closed, and people were sitting around with closed shops and no work<sup>69</sup>

Against this background of lawless anarchy in the city, the Mughal court, for all its weakness, assumed a centrality and a political importance it had

not had for a century.

The daily audiences, or durbars, were resumed for the first time since the Persian sack of the city in 1739, and the Emperor, Bahadur Shah II, was hailed again throughout Hindustan as Mightiest King of Kings, Emperor son of Emperor, Sultan son of Sultan. As the *Sadiq ul-Akabhar* put it, 'We humbly and greatly thank our Lord and express our gratitude to him for putting an end to the tyrannical rule of the Christians and for restoring the administration and governance of his exalted Majesty the Khalifa, the Shadow of God on Earth, the Deputy of the Divine Prophet.'<sup>70</sup> Yet for all this rhetoric, behind the façade the royal family reacted by splitting into competing and deeply divided factions.

The group that most enthusiastically embraced the Uprising consisted of a party of five young passed-over princes. Their future had been looking distinctly bleak until the day of the outbreak: whether or not Mirza Jawan Bakht succeeded Zafar, and whether or not the Mughals continued in the Red Fort, they all seemed destined to live out restricted lives of genteel princely poverty. For all of them the Uprising presented a unique opportunity for self-improvement. All five immediately grabbed the chance that fate had presented.

Four of these five princes were men of little obvious talent or standing at the court, and they barely appear in the Palace records prior to 1857. Mirza Khizr Sultan was Zafar's ninth son, the illegitimate child of a Palace concubine named Rahim Bakhsh Bai<sup>71</sup> Aged twenty-three in 1857, he was renowned for his physical beauty – indeed, Ghalib said he was as beautiful as Yusuf, the biblical Joseph – and he had some capacity as a poet and a marksman; but his only appearances in the Palace diary had been when he had asked his father for an elephant and a house of his own in Mehrauli in 1852, and been promptly turned down. This was possibly because he was closely associated with the disgraced Mirza Fakhru; certainly his wife and Mirza Fakhru's wife appear to have been best friends<sup>72</sup> His second appearance in the court diary was even less promising: in August 1852 he was publicly rebuked by Zafar in full durbar for beating his wife, at which point the prince 'fell at HM's feet and prayed forgiveness of his fault. The King struck him two or three times very angrily and then pardoned him, warning him for the future to live on good terms with his wife'.<sup>73</sup>

Mirza Khizr was a close friend of the second of the princes who threw their lot in with the rebels: Mirza Abu Bakr, the eldest son of Mirza Fakhru and Zafar's oldest surviving legitimate grandson. His only appearance in the records prior to 1857 was in November 1853, when he succeeded in removing one of his own fingers in a gun accident, but he quickly made up for lost time during the Uprising. Of all the royal family Mirza Abu Bakr seems most quickly to have grasped the opportunities the new dispensation presented for letting his hair down: within a few days of the outbreak he began appearing in petitions and complaints to the King, accused of whoring and drunkenness, whipping his servants, beating up watchmen and casually attacking any policeman who tried to rein him in.<sup>74</sup>

The third prince was even more obscure: all that is known about Mirza Bakhtawar Shah before 1857 is that he was Zafar's eleventh son, the illegitimate child of another of Zafar's concubines, Hanwa, that he was born in 1839, and that he was married to Mirza Fakhru's daughter in 1852.<sup>75</sup> The fourth rebel prince was another grandson of Zafar's: Mirza Abdulla, son of Zafar's eldest boy, Mirza Shah Rukh, who had died in 1847. On his father's death he and his concubine mother, Khairum Bai, had gone off on the haj to Mecca, from which they had returned in December 1853. After receiving a haj present of a fine white mare from his grandfather, Mirza Abdullah disappears from the records until the outbreak in May 1857.<sup>76</sup>

The fifth of the princes was, however, a man very different from the other four, and he soon established himself as the effective head of whatever civil administration existed during the months of the Uprising. Mirza Mughal was Zafar's fifth son, and his oldest surviving legitimate male child. In 1857 he was aged twenty-nine, only nine years younger than his powerful stepmother Zinat Mahal; his own mother was a sayyida (descendant of the Prophet) of aristocratic birth named Sharaf ul-Mahal Sayyidani, who was a senior figure in Zafar's harem.<sup>77</sup>

Unlike the four other insurgent princes, Mirza Mughal appears frequently in the court records before the Uprising and held a prominent position at court. He was the principal beneficiary of the disgrace of Mirza Fakhru: after the latter's fall in February 1852, Mirza Mughal took on the powerful offices of Palace nazir and *qiladar* [fort keeper], which effectively made him the Palace paymaster and chamberlain; he also received most of Mirza Fakhru's estates and the income that went with them<sup>78</sup> He achieved

this high position partly through reaching an understanding with Zinat Mahal, whose protégé he effectively became; she appears to have befriended and assisted him as a counterbalance to Mirza Fakhru: there is a telling reference in the court diary to her advising him, 'Have no fears on the subject,' when he consulted her about his problems on succeeding to Mirza Fakhru's offices<sup>79</sup>

There are two pictures extant of Mirza Mughal. He is present as an earnest and serious little boy of ten, wearing full court dress, in Zafar's coronation portrait of 1838.<sup>80</sup> But it is the oil portrait by August Schoefft, painted some time in the early 1850s, a few years before the outbreak, which is the most revealing image.<sup>81</sup> It shows a handsome, dynamic and athletic-looking youth, dressed in flowing white robes that offset his dark skin, brown eyes and full black beard. If Schoefft's image of Zafar shows a benign, weary and melancholy old man, his image of Mirza Mughal is its polar opposite – an image of a restless, impatient and frustrated young man who glares out of the frame with pride, suppressed anger and even a trace of bitterness.

Although he wears as many gems as his brother Jawan Bakht and his father in their companion portraits, it is his sword and stabbing dagger which draw the eye; from the expression of Mirza Mughal's face you are left in little doubt that he would use these weapons if the need arose. He has an energy and an urge to engage with the world that are wholly absent in the gentle and other-worldly expression of his father; there is also a seriousness and gravity quite absent from the image of his vain-looking younger brother. Yet for all that, there is in his eyes just a hint of Zafar's lack of self-assurance.

Though there are no references to Mirza Mughal's whereabouts on the day that the sepoys arrived in Delhi, by the morning of the 12th he appeared in the durbar with his younger brothers, and together they 'applied for the principal commands in the army'. Zafar dismissed the request on the advice of Zinat Mahal and Hakim Ahsanullah Khan, who argued that 'they were not of sufficient age and experience for such appointments, nor would they understand any of the duties [of soldiers]; they were much displeased in consequence'. But the following day the princes returned with 'officers of the army, to join them in their request'. Again Zafar and Hakim Ahsanullah Khan opposed the plan: 'You don't know the work,' said Zafar. 'What will you do as officers?' But the princes and the sepoys held their ground 'and

accordingly, two days after [on the 15th] they were severally nominated to commands and received dresses of honour'. With the consent of the sepoys, Mirza Mughal was given the title Commander-in-Chief.<sup>82</sup>

It is possible that Mirza Mughal, along with his brothers Abu Bakr and Khizr Sultan, had secretly been in contact with the sepoys prior to the outbreak; certainly this was what Zinat Mahal maintained afterwards.\* This would help explain the speed with which Mirza Mughal established a rapport with the sepoys, while the rest of the Palace kept a suspicious distance. Either way, from this point onwards Mirza Mughal threw himself energetically into the business of managing the army and trying to administer the town, which he did in collaboration with Theo Metcalfe's friend and saviour, Muin ud-Din Husain Khan, whom he made kotwal the day after his own appointment.

One of the biggest surprises contained in the Mutiny Papers is the sheer quantity of paperwork produced by Mirza Mughal and his office: the papers contain many thousands of Mirza Mughal's orders; indeed, several whole collections contain nothing else.\* Collection 60 alone contains 831 orders from Mirza Mughal's secretariat.

It is striking how many of the Indian nationalist accounts of 1857 make the assumption, common among imperial British historians, that any Mughal prince must necessarily be a lazy fop, and Mirza Mughal is generally written off as an effete and useless aristocrat. Yet to judge from the documentation contained in the National Archives, Mirza Mughal was one of the most energetic and industrious of all those who espoused the cause of the Uprising in 1857. More than anyone else, it seems, Mirza Mughal realised the importance of providing some organised logistical back-up to the Uprising, and a coherent administration for Delhi. As it turned out, his administration rarely got beyond crisis management, and never succeeded in turning itself into a force able to control either the different sepoy regiments or the growing numbers of freelance jihadis collecting in Delhi; but if it failed, it was certainly not for lack of industry.

From the first week, Mirza Mughal produced an incessant stream of orders and commands: attempting to get the sepoys out of the city and into a series of coherent military camps; sending policemen or Palace guards to rescue any bazaars that were being plundered or noblemen whose houses were being attacked; promising the sepoys pay and raising the money to provide it; finding sufficient food for both the sepoys and the people of

Delhi; receiving and attending to the petitions of individual sepoys; providing spades, shovels, axes and sandbags for entrenchments and defence works; imposing a strict code of conduct on the military so that, for example, there could be no house searches without a permit; negotiating to restrain the Gujar tribes outside the walls; establishing a mint to produce coins with Zafar's portrait upon them; and not least, attempting to rally his increasingly depressed father and control his own brothers.

Mirza Mughal was almost certainly behind a circular letter sent out in Zafar's name to all the princes and rajas of India, asking them to join the Uprising and appealing for their loyalty on the grounds that all faiths were under attack by the British. The letter refers specifically to the laws banning sati and allowing converts to inherit, and the Company's facilitation of missionary activity, and the alleged conversion of prisoners locked in British jails: "The English are people who overthrow all religions,' it states. 'You should understand well their object of destroying the religions of Hindustan … It is now my firm conviction that if the English continue in Hindustan they will … utterly overthrow our religions. As the English are the common enemy of both [Hindus and Muslims, we] should unite in their slaughter … for by this alone will the lives and faiths of both be saved.'<sup>83</sup>

One document that probably was not, however, produced by Mirza Mughal or his chancery was a remarkable declaration known (quite erroneously) as the Manifesto of the King of Delhi or (more accurately, since it had nothing to do with Zafar) as the Azamgarh Proclamation. Unlike the circular letter, the proclamation is almost wholly secular in tone, and is aimed at a broad base of different interest groups; indeed, it is the nearest thing produced during the Uprising to a manifesto of national independence. Its opening sentence sets the tone, a cry to arms noting that 'both Hindoos and Mohammedans are being ruined under the tyranny and oppression of the infidel and treacherous English'. While noting that 'at present a war is ranging with the English on account of religion', and calling on 'pundits and fakirs' to join with Mughal armies, most of its space is given over to complaints that the English have overtaxed the landowners, monopolised 'all the posts of dignity and emolument' in the civil and armed services, and put Indian artisans out of business by flooding the market with cheap British imports.

Some historians, pleased to have found a rare document from 1857 that explicitly mentions economic and social grievances, have linked this

remarkably modern document with the Red Fort, and thereby perhaps exaggerated its influence and importance. For its author was actually the rather obscure and enigmatic Mughal prince Firoz Shah, who, while probably a grandson of Zafar, fought exclusively in Avadh and Lucknow, and never once came to Delhi in the course of the Uprising. Perhaps partly because of this, the more secular issues he raises are intriguingly different, in both tone and content, from those being articulated as major grievances at the time in the Mughal capital.<sup>84</sup>

![](_page_26_Picture_1.jpeg)

If most of the princes threw in their lot with the Uprising, having little to lose and much to gain, Zinat Mahal and her beloved only son, Jawan Bakht, took the opposite course – and for the same reason.

Zinat Mahal was wholly opposed to the course her husband was pursuing, and regarded it as ruinous for the chances of Jawan Bakht. It was also the first time since their marriage that Zafar had publicly gone against her advice on a major issue. According to the memoir of Hakim Ahsanullah Khan, the Queen 'remonstrated that the King paid no attention to her. [But] he [merely] replied, "Let what God wills happen."'<sup>85</sup>

Zinat Mahal had apparently calculated that the British would soon return and rout the sepoys, and that loyalty to them might yet result in their recognising the succession of her beloved son; either way, whatever the reasoning, it was she who encouraged Zafar to send an express camel messenger to the Governor of the North West Provinces in Agra on the night of the outbreak.<sup>86</sup> Later, she made sure Jawan Bakht kept his distance from the insurgents and did not become in any way implicated in their violence. When Mirza Mughal was made Commander-in-Chief, Jawan Bakht was given the nominal title of Vazir, but he was kept far away from the sepoys and did not become involved in the administration of the city. 87

Ranged alongside Zinat Mahal and Mirza Jawan Bakht in the discreetly pro-British faction in the Palace were the head eunuch and Zinat Mahal's enforcer, Mahbub Ali Khan; Zafar's prime minister, Hakim Ahsanullah

Khan; and Mirza Ilahe Bakhsh, father-in-law of the late Mirza Fakhru. In 1852, Ilahe Bakhsh had been the bitter rival of Zinat Mahal, Jawan Bakht and Mahbub Ali Khan. Now the crisis resulted in an unexpected realignment of the old court factions: Mirza Mughal, formerly Zinat's protégé, now became her rival; while Mirza Ilahe Bakhsh, formerly her enemy, became her ally. 88

Zafar himself stood slightly apart from his wife and principal advisers. While well aware of the dangers posed by the sepoys, disgusted by their manners and profoundly alarmed and depressed by the looting of his city, he nevertheless recognised the possibility that the Uprising could yet save the House of Timur, and ensure a future for his dynasty, something he had consistently worked for since his accession in 1837. He therefore gave his blessing and public support to the Uprising, and took seriously his role as newly empowered Mughal Emperor, while doing all he could to limit the depredations of the sepoys.

The degree to which Zinat Mahal, Mahbub Ali Khan and Hakim Ahsanullah Khan were operating their own policy in regard to the Uprising, quite independent of the Emperor, and in direct opposition to Mirza Mughal and the other princes, became apparent in the most dramatic fashion five days after the outbreak, at the morning durbar on Saturday, 16 May. According to the diary of the news-writer Chunni Lal, who was present,

The troopers and infantry soldiers, accompanied by their officers, attended and presented a letter bearing the seals of the physician Ahsanullah Khan and Nawab Mabub Ali Khan, which they said had been intercepted at the Delhi Gate of the city. They complained that the physician and the Nawab had sent this letter to the English, inviting them to come to the city immediately, and promising that provided that the English should agree to acknowledge Mirza Jawan Bakht, the son of the King by the Queen Zinat Mahal, as heir apparent, they would on their part engage to seize and make over all the soldiery now in Delhi.<sup>89</sup>

Both the hakim and the eunuch – who was ill and had to be brought to court prostrate in his *palki* – swore than the document was a forgery, but they were not believed. Things began to look very bad for both courtiers: 'The men of the cavalry and infantry drew their swords and surrounded the

physician declaring their firm belief that he maintained an understanding with the English.'<sup>90</sup>

It was at this point that one of the sepoys mentioned the British prisoners that Zafar had kept in safe custody in the Palace. Their number had now grown to fifty-two after the new kotwal, Muin ud-Din, had brought in several families who were about to be killed, after having been discovered hiding in the city. The sepoys accused the hakim and the eunuch of keeping the prisoners alive so that 'when the English came he might make them over, and would have the soldiers killed' – no doubt very much what the men did indeed have in mind.<sup>91</sup>

The sepoys then called for the prisoners, who were being kept and fed by Zafar in a room beside the Palace kitchens, not far from the Lahore Gate. They bound them and took them to a peepul tree near the shallow tank in front of the Palace drum house, the Naqqar Khana, and began to taunt them that they were about to be slaughtered.

According to Jiwan Lal, 'the King and his courtiers stood like dumb puppets' at first, horrified by what the sepoys were contemplating. 'Then the King ordered the sepoys to separate into parties, Mahommedans and Hindus, and he appealed to each to consult their religious advisers to see if there was any authority for the slaughter of helpless men and women and children.'<sup>92</sup> Their murder can never be allowed,' said Zafar, adding that the Queen was also wholly opposed to any massacre.<sup>93</sup> Sa'id Mubarak Shah recorded that

The king wept and besought the mutineers not to take the lives of helpless women and children, saying to them 'take care – for if you commit such a deed the vengeance and angel of God will fall on us all. Why slay the innocent?' But the Mutineers refused to listen and replied 'we'll kill them, and in your palace, so that whatever the result you and we shall be considered one in this business, and you will be thought equally guilty by the English.'<sup>94</sup>

Both the kotwal, Muin ud-Din, and the courtier Zahir Dehlavi, who were also present, recorded that the King continued to argue with the sepoys and refused to give his consent to the murder, but was eventually silenced by Hakim Ahsanullah Khan. The hakim had been deeply shaken by the

exposure of his correspondence, and warned the King that if he continued to argue both their lives would be taken.

When Zahir saw that the sepoys were preparing to go ahead with the slaughter, he begged the hakim to make a last effort to stop the massacre: 'I told him that I had seen the prisoners being taken out,' he recorded later,

and I was afraid that they were about to kill them, and that he must do something quickly to stop them. To this I got a reply, 'What can I do?' I told him this is the time to prove our loyalty, and that if he wanted to save the King then he had to try and persuade the rebels to stop this crime and save the prisoners, otherwise the English would come and level Delhi and turn it into an empty wasteland in revenge for this spilling of innocent blood. Ahsanullah Khan replied, 'You are still a child. You do not realize that in public life a man must use his reason rather than give way to his emotions. If we try to dissuade the rebels now they will kill us before they kill the English, and then they will kill the King.'<sup>95</sup>

It was anyway too late. By the time Ahsanullah had finished speaking, the sepoys and the Palace mob had got to work.

They made the prisoners sit down, and one of them fired his carbine at them. After this two of the King's personal armed retainers killed all the Europeans, men, women and children, with their swords. There were about 200 Mussalmans standing at the tank, uttering the coarsest abuse at the prisoners. The sword of one of the king's retainers broke. After the slaughter, the bodies were taken on two carts, and thrown into the river. This occurrence caused a great excitement amongst the Hindus throughout the city, who said that these Purbeas who had committed this heinous and atrocious cruelty could never be victorious against the English.<sup>96</sup>

For Zafar the massacre was a turning point. The sepoys were quite correct that the British would never forgive the mass killing of innocents, and Zafar's failure to prevent it proved as fatal for him and his dynasty as it was for them.

![](_page_30_Picture_0.jpeg)

By the end of the second week of the Uprising even the formerly enthusiastic Maulvi Muhammad Baqar was beginning to have second thoughts about what was going on: 'The population is greatly harassed and sick of the pillaging and plundering,' he wrote in an editorial in the *Dihli Urdu Akbhar* on 24 May.

Whether people of the city, or outsiders from the East, everybody is busy looting and plundering. The police stations do not have even an iota of control and authority. Colonel James Skinner's *kothi* was plundered so badly that it cannot be described. In the city and around and about, the Gujars and Jats have created havoc. The roads are blocked, and thousands of houses have been plundered and burnt. Great peril confronts all the respectable and well-off people of Delhi … the city is being ravaged.<sup>97</sup>

Baqar emphasised, however, that it wasn't just the sepoys who were looting: the city mob was equally responsible, some of whom had disguised themselves as soldiers. 'Having pillaged the guns, arms and ammunition from the magazine and from English *kothis*, people have taken to dressing up like Tilangas and committing plunder,' he wrote.

Five men were arrested yesterday. It was eventually revealed that some were cobblers who worked in the cantonment, and that two more were *chamars* [an untouchable caste]. They were taken to the platoon they claimed to belong to, and when their lies were uncovered the Subahdar and the sepoys gave them a heavy lashing and they are now in captivity. 98

Baqar understood that behind the anarchy there lay a fundamental problem of authority. While there was clearly a certain amount of collusion and communication between the different regiments prior to the outbreak, each regiment had mutinied individually, had come to Delhi under its own steam

and, once there, looked to its own subahdars for leadership. The regiments remained self-contained: they camped separately, accepted no overall sepoy general, and strongly resisted the idea of a commander of any other regiment having authority over them. The princes remained associated with individual regiments, and Mirza Mughal's attempts to act as a coordinating commander-in-chief had only very limited success. Since the Mughals were never able either to pay or to properly punish errant sepoys, or indeed disobedient regiments, there was a limit to how much authority they could ever actually wield over the rebel forces, and to some extent the regiments remained a collection of disparate private armies, each under its own subahdar, who acted as a semi-independent warlord. 'The rebels are without a leader,' was how the news-writer of the Raja of Kapurthala succinctly put it.<sup>99</sup>

To make matters worse, by the end of the second week fights between the infantry regiments and the cavalry *sawars* were becoming increasingly common. The Meerut and Delhi sepoys remained on especially bad terms, and frequently came to blows over the division of the loot from the city. 100 As Ghalib wrote in his diary at the time, the sepoys rapidly gathering in his city were 'a thousand armies marshalled without marshals, unnumbered bands, led by no commander and yet ready for war'.<sup>101</sup> The Emperor was equally depressed. According to the report of a spy, after one bout of bloodshed in which the Delhi and Meerut regiments had refused to obey their commanders and had instead fought with each other, Zafar had shaken his head and said, 'The skies have fallen down upon us.'<sup>102</sup>

Baqar was also alarmed: 'Everyone is full of praise for the efficiency of the Kotwal of the city,' he wrote in his paper, 'but both high and low are helpless because of the lack of control over the Tilangas. Many of the poor are said to be bordering on starvation … moneylenders are lying low because of fear of the Tilangas. The arrangement of two things is highly imperative and urgent: first the distribution of salaries, and secondly the restraining of the Tilangas.'<sup>103</sup>

If the sepoys refused to obey the subahdars of other sepoy regiments, still less did they relish taking orders from the Delhi police; when the police attempted to prevent them from looting, they instantly fought back. At the Lahore Gate a policeman who tried to stop the Tilangas looting was badly beaten up: 'Below the ramparts a *barqandaz* [armed police constable] noted

some sacks of loot stashed by the wall and he challenged the owner,' the local police chief afterwards reported to the new kotwal, Muin ud-Din.

The owner, a Tilanga, argued back and unsheathed a sword. There was some jostling and raised voices, until some other Tilangas came [to help their comrade] and hit the *barqandaz* until he was bleeding then they took him into their custody. The Tilangas are meant to be royal servants. If this goes on then it will be impossible to maintain order and discipline<sup>104</sup>

On another occasion, a policeman tried to stop a group of sepoys from running a protection racket in Gali Qasim Jan: 'They take bribes for all the stolen goods that pass,' reported the local *thanadar* (police station chief) to the kotwal,

and if they are paid they let them be, but whoever does not give them a bribe is greatly harassed by the guards. Whenever the *barqandazes* of this police station who are posted there object, they abuse and threaten them. Recently it has got worse: they have begun arresting whomever they cannot extort money from, and now they are saying we should all withdraw from the police station and stop interfering with them.<sup>105</sup>

For all the weakness of Mirza Mughal's administration, Zafar realised he did possess one trump card he could play in order to try to bring some pressure on the sepoys: non-cooperation. His first glimpse of the power he wielded in this way was on 14 May, when the sepoys had disregarded his orders about moving out of his beloved Moonlight Garden, the Mehtab Bagh. Seeing this, Zafar had gone into his private apartments and, 'distracted and perplexed, shut himself up, refusing audience to all'. Before long some of the sepoys began moving out of his garden and into what was left of the cantonments to the north of the city.

Observing the effect of this, Zafar issued an edict a week later, threatening to remove himself from the city altogether, and go off into retirement in Mecca if the plundering of his people did not cease. It was the same threat he had made to Sir Thomas Metcalfe five years earlier. This

time it worked. Baqar covered this development approvingly in the *Dihli Urdu Akbhar*:

It is announced that hearing of the state of ruin and plunder being faced by the population, and the chaos and anarchy that reigns throughout the city, His Exalted Majesty has issued an edict stating that the soldiers are harassing both the population and the loyal servants of State, and making all their lives impossible: 'Earlier the *firangis* issued orders as they pleased to our dear subjects, and the population was always worried and harassed by the English soldiers. Now you Tilangas are causing even more grief and trouble with your plundering. If this continues, then these must be the Last Days. I have no love for the throne or for money, and give notice that I will proceed into retirement towards [the Sufi shrine of] Khwaja Saheb [in Mehrauli], and all the subjects of his Majesty too will accompany their ruler and go with him. Hence I plan to migrate towards the Ka'ba and the Haram Sharif of Mecca, there to spend the rest of my days in prayer, repentance and remembering the Almighty.'

It is said that when this announcement was read, all present in the Durbar became tear-filled. Let us pray that God Almighty, the provider of all aid, will create a situation in which the city is brought to order. This will give relief to the people and also remove the furrows of worry and apprehension from His Majesty's brow … 106

It was not to be. Instead, on 19 May, there were signs of a potentially yet more damaging division. That morning, one of the more Orthodox mullahs of Delhi, Maulvi Muhammad Sayyid, set up a standard of jihad in the Jama Masjid, in an apparent effort to turn the Uprising into an exclusively Muslim holy war. Zafar immediately ordered it to be taken down 'because such a display of fanaticism would only tend to exasperate the Hindus'.

The next day, the 20th, just as news came that the Delhi Field Force was collecting in Ambala, the maulvi turned up at the Palace to remonstrate with Zafar, claiming that the Hindus were all supporters of the English, and that a jihad against them was therefore perfectly legitimate. At the same time a

delegation of Delhi Hindus also turned up at the Fort, angrily denying the maulvi's charge. Zafar declared that in his eyes Hindus and Muslims were equal and that 'such a jihad is quite impossible, and such an idea an act of extreme folly, for the majority of the *Purbia* soldiers were Hindus. Such an act would create a civil war and the results would be deplorable. The Holy War is against the English. I have forbidden it against the Hindus'.<sup>107</sup>

At this point in the Uprising, Zafar seems to have succeeded in silencing the jihadis. But eight weeks later, when large numbers of 'Wahhabi' mujahedin had collected in the city from all over northern India, it would prove far more difficult.
