More ominously still, the far bank of the Yamuna was cloudy with rising dust. According to the account of his young attendant, Zahir Dehlavi, Zafar shouted to Mir Fateh Ali, the Chief of his Palanquin Bearers, who was waiting outside the oratory to take him on his morning tour of the Palace. Zafar told him to send an express camel messenger to find out the cause of the fire and the rising dust; he also summoned his prime minister, Hakim Ahsanullah Khan, and Captain Douglas, the Commandant of the Palace Guards, who was responsible to the Resident for security in the Palace.<sup>2</sup></p>",

They had already looted and burned the Toll House on the east bank of the river. They had also attacked and killed both the toll keeper and the manager of the city telegraph office, Charles Todd, who had just half an hour earlier set off in his buggy to try to find the cause of the break in the telegraph line to Meerut. Some servants of British officials whom they happened to meet on the way had also been hacked down as they passed. The messenger added that the early morning bathers were now running in panic from the river ghats and were scrambling to get into the city through the Calcutta Gate, just to the north of the Palace. On hearing this, Zafar gave immediate orders that the gates of the city and the Fort should all be closed, and that if it was not too late, the bridge should also be broken.<sup>3</sup></p>",

In his view the sepoys were guided by the hand of an angry God, outraged at the attacks made on the true faith by the British. For this reason, unlike most of the educated Delhi elite, Baqar was from the beginning an enthusiastic cheerleader for the Uprising. By eight in the morning he was out on the streets, carefully noting what was happening: 'This humble writer, having heard the sound of gunshots, for the sake of Islam, came out of his house, and caring more for enjoyment and distraction of his readers than for his own life, without hesitation started moving towards the disturbance in order to inquire into the details,' he wrote.</p>",

They had clearly expected the Emperor to shower them in gold for coming and offering service. Instead, they had received a mixed reception in the city and an openly hostile one in the Palace. Moreover, despite their having come all the way to Delhi to seek the shelter of the Emperor, Zafar had not been seen since the first party of troopers shouted up to him in the early morning. So at around 4 p.m. their leaders sent word to the King that they had come 'to fight for our religion and to pay our respects to His Majesty'.<sup>58</sup> When this again failed to produce the Emperor, the soldiers massed in the courtyard in front of the Diwan i-Khas and 'commenced firing their muskets, pistols and carbines in the air, making a great clamour', according to Ghulam Abbas, Zafar's vakil (attorney).</p>",

Unable to make up his mind whether to attend or not, Zafar had taken to his bed and sent a succession of no fewer than 'thirteen doctors to say he was too ill to come'. He dithered backwards and forwards all afternoon before 'he changed his mind yet again and came, and in the meanwhile, half our troops who were out for the durbar were fainting away from the heat'.<sup>63</sup> Likewise, when Zafar had had his spat with Mirza Fakhru in 1852, he oscillated week to week, one day banning his eldest son from the durbar and forbidding any of the courtiers from having contact with him, then the next he would declare his love for the Mirza and tell the members of the court that they need have no fear of befriending him or attending his monsoon parties.<sup>64</sup></p>",

With the dhobi's assistance, Morley made his escape, dressed in the dhobi's wife's petticoat and veil.

I did not know if they might remark that my <i>chadar</i> was held awkwardly and thus find me out.'
