## **5 THE SWORD OF THE LORD OF FURY**

In 1857, Monday, 11 May in the Christian calendar corresponded to the sixteenth day of Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting and penance.

During this Islamic Lent, the usual rhythms of city life changed dramatically. The day began much earlier than usual, an hour before sunrise, when the moon was still high in the sky, with the sound of a gong ringing repeatedly in the Jama Masjid. Lamps would be lit, meals hurriedly prepared. Mendicants would earn a few paise by knocking on the doors of anyone who seemed still to be sleeping, for this would be the last chance to grab some refreshment – and for the orthodox, even a drop of water – before sunset, more than twelve hours away. 1

It was now high summer, and the terrible, desiccating Delhi heat was at its worst. In the pre-dawn glimmer, in courtyards across Delhi, Muslim families would be sitting outside, leaning against bolsters, eating their *sahri*, the pre-fast meal of sweet *sivayan* (semolina), and for those who could muster the appetite so early in the day, kebabs too, all to be wolfed down before the sound of a cannon-shot from the Fort announced the sun's

imminent appearance over the horizon. In these days of fiery winds, the early morning had the added attraction of the day's only cool breezes.

By 7 a.m. Zafar had finished his breakfast, and was saying his morning prayers in his river-front oratory, the *tasbih khana*. As he rose, leaning on a stick, he noticed that in the middle distance to his left, beyond the meandering river at the far end of the Bridge of Boats, a tall pillar of smoke was bellowing out of the Toll House, silhouetted now against the rising sun. More ominously still, the far bank of the Yamuna was cloudy with rising dust. According to the account of his young attendant, Zahir Dehlavi, Zafar shouted to Mir Fateh Ali, the Chief of his Palanquin Bearers, who was waiting outside the oratory to take him on his morning tour of the Palace. Zafar told him to send an express camel messenger to find out the cause of the fire and the rising dust; he also summoned his prime minister, Hakim Ahsanullah Khan, and Captain Douglas, the Commandant of the Palace Guards, who was responsible to the Resident for security in the Palace.<sup>2</sup>

By the time the hakim and the commandant appeared, the messenger had already returned. He had ridden only as far as the bastion of Salimgarh, a few thousand yards away, and from there could clearly see that Indian cavalrymen (or *sawars*) in their Company uniforms were clattering across the Bridge of Boats, swords drawn. They had already looted and burned the Toll House on the east bank of the river. They had also attacked and killed both the toll keeper and the manager of the city telegraph office, Charles Todd, who had just half an hour earlier set off in his buggy to try to find the cause of the break in the telegraph line to Meerut. Some servants of British officials whom they happened to meet on the way had also been hacked down as they passed. The messenger added that the early morning bathers were now running in panic from the river ghats and were scrambling to get into the city through the Calcutta Gate, just to the north of the Palace. On hearing this, Zafar gave immediate orders that the gates of the city and the Fort should all be closed, and that if it was not too late, the bridge should also be broken.<sup>3</sup>

Captain Douglas and Ahsanullah Khan were alarmed but hardly very surprised by Zafar's dramatic news. It was not just that rumours of a mutiny in the army had been circulating in the Palace for months now, and of late growing increasingly insistent and precise.<sup>4</sup> Twenty minutes earlier, Douglas had been summoned by the guards of the Fort's Lahore Gate, who had told him that a lone cavalryman was making a disturbance. Douglas had

come straight down from the quarters immediately above the gate that he shared with Padre Jennings. Asked what he wanted, the *sawar* had coolly replied that he had mutinied at Meerut, and that he and his brothers would no longer serve the Company: the time had come, he said, to fight for their faith. But now that he had arrived in Delhi he had come to the Fort in search of a pipe and a drink of water: could Douglas go and find him one? Douglas had given orders to the guards to seize the insolent *sawar*, but before they could do so, he had ridden off laughing.<sup>5</sup> The hakim was just coming down the covered bazaar of the Fort to investigate the disturbance when the summons came from Zafar; both men arrived at the Emperor's oratory together.

As the three were still conferring on what action to take, a group of twenty cavalrymen trotted calmly up along the strand separating the Palace from the river: 'some had their swords drawn; others had pistols and carbines in their hands; more were coming from the direction of the bridge, accompanied by men on foot, apparently grooms, with bundles on their heads'.<sup>6</sup> There were also in the middle distance a crowd of 'convicts from the Meerut Jail and Gujar tribesmen\* and other *badmashes* (ruffians or ne'er-do-wells) from the villages round about Delhi', who had presumably followed the sepoys as they headed south.<sup>7</sup> They halted under the gilt dome and latticework screens of the Saman Burj, where the Mughals had for centuries attended to petitioners; then they began loudly calling for the Emperor. According to Zafar's record of the event, 'they said, we have come from Meerut after killing all the Englishmen there, because they asked us to bite bullets with our teeth that were coated with the fat of cows and pigs. This has corrupted the faith of Hindus and Muslims alike'.<sup>8</sup>

At this, Douglas offered to go down and talk to the men, but the Emperor forbade it, saying that he was unarmed and that the men were murderers and would surely kill him. 'I did not let him go … Then the Qiladar Bahadur [Douglas] went to the window and spoke to them,' saying:<sup>9</sup> '"Don't come here; these are the private apartments of the ladies of the Palace; your standing opposite them is a disrespect to the king." On this they gradually, one by one, went off in the direction of the Rajghat Gate [to the south].'<sup>10</sup>

'After that,' according to Zafar, 'the Qiladar said, "I will go and take care of this", and took my leave.'<sup>11</sup>

Douglas ran off 'in a state of excitement' to make sure that all the city's many gates had followed the orders to close. But within minutes Zafar, sitting on his terrace, could see great black plumes of smoke rising to the south, from within the walls, apparently from the smartest quarter of the city – Daryaganj – where five years earlier Zafar had processed with his family to witness the wedding of Mirza Jawan Bakht.

The sepoys, Zafar could plainly see, were now inside his city. 12

For Theo Metcalfe, 11 May meant the beginning of a six-monthlong sabbatical from work in Kashmir.

He was suffering from exhaustion and depression – an intense 'numbness of feeling that weighs me down'. Moreover his left eye was now so inflamed that he had to wear an eyepatch; indeed, the people of Delhi had begun calling him 'One-eyed Metcalfe'. He was under no illusions about the critical nature of the situation in India – he had recently told a friend who was returning to England, 'you are lucky to be going home, for we shall soon be kicked out of India, or we shall fight to the death for our existence'. He badly needed a holiday, and now could not wait to get into the *dak palki* that would take him to join GG and his son Charlie in the cool green valleys of the Himlayas – his first proper break since he had arrived in India seven years earlier. 13

He rose early, finished closing up Metcalfe House, and then around 7 a.m. set off at a leisurely place to his office at the Kutcherry Court House, just inside Kashmiri Gate, to hand over charge to his successor. There, to his surprise, he found the courts empty,

with only the Assistant Magistrate [Arthur Galloway] present, who was waiting, not knowing what to do … [It was] reported that the Treasury Guard had been overheard the night before saying that the Government had been tampering with their religion, and 'what would be, would be.' The report was followed by one from the

Darogah [officer] of the Yamuna Bridge, that the mutineers [from Meerut] were hastening towards the city. 14

Theo looked out through the river-front window at the back of his office: there on the far bank, haloed in dust but still quite unmistakable, was a large body of infantry, led by a troupe of *sawars*, heading for the Bridge of Boats and making ready to cross.

Jumping back into his buggy, Theo drove straight to the fortified magazine that lay a little to the south, next to the new premises of the Delhi College, with which it shared the former site of the great Mughal haveli of Shah Jahan's son, Dara Shukoh.\* <sup>15</sup> There he met his friend Lieutenant George Willoughby of the Bengal Artillery, who was in charge of the arsenal. Theo asked Willoughby for two guns to place at the end of the bridge so as to prevent the mutineers from crossing. But looking out over the riverside bastion at the rear of the compound, directly overlooking the bridge, the pair saw they were already too late: several hundred mutineers were now marching in open column over the bridge, and the foremost sepoys had already taken possession of the Delhi bank of the Yamuna.<sup>16</sup> Leaving Willoughby to close and barricade the magazine, Theo set off at breakneck speed to see whether he might yet close the Calcutta Gate, which commanded the passage from the bridge into the city.

Here Theo was, for once, in time. Simon Fraser, the Resident, and Theo's senior colleagues, the two chief magistrates of Delhi, John Ross Hutchinson and Charles Le Bas, had already arrived at the gate and managed to get it closed before the sepoys got there. From there, Theo could hear the tramp of feet as the sepoy infantry retraced their steps, having failed to push open the gate. They were now heading south along the sandy bed of the river to try to find an alternative route into the city. The four Englishmen stood on the parapet of the gate, anxiously watching the sepoys through their binoculars; behind, a crowd of frustrated would-be bathers and increasingly restive spectators was massing between the gate and Anguri Bagh, Zafar's beloved Grape Garden, 'the riff raff of the city every moment adding fresh recruits to the already turbulent mob'.<sup>17</sup>

Guessing that the sepoys now planned to try to enter through either the Rajghat or Zinat ul-Masajid Gates of the city, Fraser asked Theo to head as fast as he could to the south of the Palace, to make sure that both these gates

had also received, and obeyed, the orders to close. Theo jumped back into his buggy and galloped around the Palace walls; but after only a couple of thousand yards, as he neared the great Lahore Gate of the Palace, and at the crossroads with Chandni Chowk, he was met by a body of mutinous cavalry coming in the opposite direction. They were probably the same *sawars* who had earlier petitioned Zafar from below the Saman Burj. Either way, they had succeeded in entering the city, and were now hunting down any Christian they could find, 'with their swords in the air and shouting', according to the memoir of Theo's sister, Emily Metcalfe.

When they saw Sir Theophilus in his buggy, some of them rushed at him and tried to strike him and his horse, but [Theo lashed them with his riding whip and they] only succeeded in slashing the hood … Sir Theophilus noticed that an enormous mob had already collected on the open ground in front of the palace, and that they were all dressed in white as if expecting a gala day. So he drove his buggy at full tilt amongst them, and seeing he was still pursued by the mounted mutineers, he jumped out into the middle of the mob.<sup>18</sup>

Here Theo threw off his dark coat and removed his trousers so that he wouldn't stand out from the rest of the crowd.<sup>19</sup> Pushing on in his undergarments, he

elbowed his way through the crowd, till he reached a group of mounted police standing under some trees as if in expectation of a row. As these men were under his orders as Joint Magistrate, he told them to charge the mutineers, but they would not stir. So he knocked the principal officer off his horse (Sir Theophilus was a very powerful man) and jumping onto it himself, wrenching the reins from his hands, he galloped into the heart of the city to see the Kotwal [head of the native police].

By now the whole city was in state of uproar. Shopkeepers were trying to close their shops; some of the bazaars were already being looted, and smoke was rising from the European mansions in Daryaganj; moreover, there was still no sign of any British troops from Meerut pursuing the mutineers – as Theo had assumed they would. Before long, however, Theo heard that the

Indian troops stationed in the Delhi cantonments to the north had now reached Kashmiri Gate and were forming up to mount a counter-attack. Getting back on his horse, and still wearing only his 'shirt and underdraws', he headed up through the maze of gullies and backstreets in the direction of the Kashmiri Gate and the troops he hoped would save him.

As he galloped past a mosque, however, a large brick thrown from an upper window hit him squarely in the back of the neck. Theo fell from his horse, and rolled off into a ditch, still and silent.<sup>20</sup>

![](_page_6_Picture_2.jpeg)

Shortly after Theo had galloped off, Simon Fraser heard shooting and the cries of the *sawars* coming from within the city.

Realising that the sepoys were now within the walls, and that he and his colleagues were trapped with their backs to a barred gate, and an increasingly angry mob – now 500 strong – just a short way down the street, Fraser came down from the parapet. He ordered his small escort of irregular cavalry – provided for him by the supposedly Anglophile Nawab of Jhajjar – to form up in line with their swords drawn, facing down the street. Hutchinson, Le Bas and Captain Douglas, who were all unarmed, stood to one side by the sentries' guardroom at the base of the gate. According to one eyewitness, a news-crier called Chunni who was in the crowd,

This had just been done when about seven troopers and two men mounted on camels galloped up by the road along the palace from the direction of Daryaganj, and immediately on coming within pistol shot distance the whole party fired at the European gentlemen at the gate … The Jhajjar sawars made no resistance, but deserted Mr Fraser and fled.<sup>21</sup>

Hutchinson, the senior magistrate, was wounded in the right arm, just above the elbow. <sup>22</sup> Fraser, however, ran to the guardroom, seized a musket from

the hands of a guard and shot one of the troopers dead. At the sight of the *sawar* falling, the crowd massing up the street became angry and began to head menacingly for the party. Deserted by Fraser's bodyguard, and trapped with the gate behind them, Douglas and Hutchinson jumped into the ditch of the Palace moat; the former fell badly and broke his ankle as he hit the bottom. Helped by Makhan, his mace bearer, who jumped down after him, Douglas limped along the ditch towards the Lahore Gate, supported on the other side by the wounded and bleeding Hutchinson.

Fraser, meanwhile, being too fat to jump, charged straight at the crowd with his buggy, and to his own surprise emerged unscathed on the far side. In the half-mile between him and the Palace, he was again attacked by several *sawars* who fired their pistols at him; but the shots missed, and the Resident arrived safely at the Lahore Gate of the Palace. There, the upright figure of Padre Jennings could be seen scanning the city with his telescope from the topmost chatri. His daughter Annie, and her friend Miss Clifford – Fraser's two choirmasters – were at his side.<sup>23</sup>

Makhan, the mace bearer, helped the two wounded men out of the ditch. According to his later testimony, Douglas 'being considerably hurt, asked to be taken into the Kuliyat Khana till he should recover a little from the shock he had received. In the meantime, the Revd Mr Jennings came down to him, and he and Mr Hutchinson conveyed him to the apartments over the gate'.<sup>24</sup> There Annie Jennings and Miss Clifford laid Douglas on a bed and gave him some tea, dressed his ankle and attended to Hutchinson's wound.

While Captain Douglas was being carried upstairs, Fraser had remained below, and attempted to mount a defence of the Lahore Gate. He ordered the gate to be closed and sent to Zafar for two cannon and a troop of armed guards. He also asked for two palanquins to remove Annie Jennings and her friend to the imperial zenana. But 'such was the confusion that neither the guards, nor the *palkis*, were forthcoming'.

No heed was paid to the orders given. The will to obey was wanting; the king's household had become rebellious, refusing to obey. Fraser remained for some time awaiting *the palkis*. Seeing that no attention was likely to be paid to his orders, he turned away as if to enter Captain Douglas's house. Pressed by the crowd, he ordered them to stand off. The gateway was guarded by a company of native infantry who he now ordered to load and close the gate;

but they refused. Mr Fraser then remonstrated with the men for their behaviour. They remained silent.<sup>25</sup>

By this time a great crowd of men and boys had collected [and] began clapping their hands as a kind of insolent bravado at what was occurring. Mr Fraser, on seeing such marked feelings of hostility, began to return to Captain Douglas's quarters, and as he reached the foot of the stairs, Hajji, a lapidary, raised his sword to make a cut at him. Mr Fraser who had a sheathed sword in his hand, turned sharply round, and thrust at him with the sword in its sheath, saying to the havildar of the gate guard, 'What kind of behaviour is this?' Upon which the havildar made a show of driving off the crowd; but no sooner was Mr Fraser's back turned than the havildar nodded to the lapidary, to signify to him that now he should renew his attack. The lapidary, thus encouraged, rushed upon Mr Fraser, and inflicted a deep and mortal wound on the right side of his neck. Mr Fraser at once fell, whereupon three other men who had been concealed in the outhouse adjoining, rushed out and cut him with their swords, over the head, face and chest till he was quite dead.<sup>26</sup>

'I was at the head of the stairs,' testified Makhan, 'and this was perpetrated at the foot of them.'

After this the crowd made a rush to the upper apartments, where the gentlemen, viz Captain Douglas, Mr Hutchinson and Mr Jennings had retired. Attacking them with swords, they at once murdered them and the two young ladies … [Padre Jennings being cut down just as he got as far as the door to escape down a second staircase.] On reaching the room where Captain Douglas was, I saw that he was not quite dead. Mamdoh, a bearer in the service of the King, perceiving this also, hit him with a bludgeon on the forehead, and killed him immediately. I saw the other bodies, including those of the two ladies. Mr Hutchinson was lying in one room, and the bodies of Captain Douglas, Mr Jennings and the two ladies in another on the floor, except Captain Douglas who was on the bed.

All the murders were perpetrated within a quarter of an hour of Mr Fraser's death, and it was now between 9 and 10 o'clock a.m.

After the death of the gentlemen, the crowd began plundering their property. Fearing for my own life I ran off to my own house in the city, and never returned to the palace.<sup>27</sup>

![](_page_9_Picture_1.jpeg)

By the time Padre Jennings was cut down, one of his two star converts had also been killed. Dr Chaman Lal had been attending to his patients at his hospital in Daryaganj when the *sawars* first charged through the Rajghat Gate. Hearing the uproar, he had gone out of the hospital to investigate, whereupon he was pointed out by the people in the street. Immediately 'one soldier pinned him down, sat on his chest, and asked what religion he was. When Dr Lal replied that he was a Christian, the sawar shot him dead at point blank range with his pistol. The cavalry then ransacked and burned the clinic'.<sup>28</sup>

The religious nature of the Uprising was becoming immediately apparent. British men and women who had converted to Islam were invariably spared, yet all Indian converts to Christianity – Hindu or Muslim – were sought out and hunted down. While Chaman Lal was one of the very first victims, as were Jennings and his two missionary assistants – both cut down as they ran to escape along the Chandni Chowk – an Anglo-Indian Christian named Mrs Aldwell managed to save herself because she knew the *kalima*, the Islamic profession of faith, and told her captors that she was a Muslim. The soldiers replied that if they were to kill a Muslim 'they would [themselves] be as bad as infidels; but that they were determined on killing all the Christians'.<sup>29</sup>

One British convert to Islam, a former Company soldier who had taken the name Abdullah Beg, remained throughout the Uprising one of the most active insurgents against British rule. On 11 May, 'on the arrival of the Mutineers, he immediately identified himself with them and became virtually a leader and advisor'; later he was seen manning the rebel artillery, assisted by another presumed convert, Sergeant-Major Gordon, 'a tall sturdylooking man, with a naturally fair face, though extremely sunburnt,

and a fine soldier-like figure', who had been spared in the massacre of Christians at the outbreak of the Uprising at Shahjahanpur on account of what his sepoys took to be his Muslim faith. In due course he was taken to Delhi, where he was said to have manned the guns on the northern face of the city walls.\* 30

Whatever its causes, the response to the Uprising fractured along distinct class lines. From the morning of 11 May onwards, the most enthusiastic insurgents among the people of Delhi were the workmen of the lower middle class – especially the Muslim weavers and textile merchants – and the same Punjabi Muslim manufacturing and merchant class who had long supported the mujahedin movement. It was these people who immediately swelled the ranks of the initially very small number of sepoys who had arrived in the Mughal capital, creating a panic and allowing many of the poorer Delhiwallahs to set off on an orgy of looting.\*

In contrast, the Delhi elite, both Hindu and Muslim, remained divided on the merits of joining the Uprising, and were from the start dubious about playing host to large numbers of desperate and violent sepoys from the east of Hindustan. According to one angry eyewitness, the nobleman Abdul Latif: 'The teachings of all religions were ignored and violated; even the poor women and children were not spared. The elite and the respected gentry of the city were appalled at the actions [of the insurgents] and were seen pleading with them. Ah! An entire world was destroyed, and as a result of these sins this city was struck down by the evil-eye.'<sup>31</sup> Ghalib was also quite clear that he didn't like the look of what was happening: 'Swarming through the open gates of Delhi, the intoxicated horsemen and rough foot soldiers ravished the city,' he wrote.

Shut in my room, I listened to the noise and tumult … From all sides one could hear the foot soldiers running and hoof beats of the horsemen coming, wave upon wave. Looking out, there was not so much as a handful of dust which was not stained with the blood of men … Woe for those fair ladies of delicate form, with faces radiant as the moon and bodies gleaming like newly mined silver! A thousand times pity those murdered children whose step was more beautiful than that of the deer and the partridge. All were sucked into the whirlpool of death, drowned in an ocean of blood.<sup>32</sup>

For Ghalib, the Uprising was more about the rise of the rabble of the lower classes than it was about the fall of the British. For him the most terrifying aspect of the revolution was the way his own courtly elite seemed to have lost control to a group of ill-educated ruffians of dubious ancestry: 'Noble men and great scholars have fallen from power,' he wrote,

and nameless men with neither name nor pedigree nor jewels nor gold, now have prestige and unlimited riches. One who wandered duststained through the streets as if blown by an idle wind, has proclaimed the wind his slave … In its shamelessness the rabble, sword in hand, rallied to one group after another. Throughout the day the rebels looted the city, and at night they slept in silken beds … The city of Delhi was emptied of its rulers and peopled instead by creatures of the Lord who accepted no lord – as if it were a garden without a gardener, and full of fruitless trees … The Emperor was powerless to repulse them; their forces gathered around him, and he fell under their duress, engulfed by them as the moon is engulfed by the eclipse.<sup>33</sup>

The young Mughal nobleman Sarvar ul-Mulk, who was then probably around twelve years old, was equally frightened by what he saw. He was being taken by a servant, Rahim Bakhsh, to visit his maternal aunt's house in Kuchah Bulaqi Begum, near the Jama Masjid, and was just crossing the Dariba on Chandni Chowk when 'we saw people running in all directions in fright'.

Rahim Bakhsh, a strong man, at once lifted me on his back and bolted. When we reached my aunt's house, the gate was being closed, but Rahim Bakhsh struck at the gate, and entered it with such force, that inside we both fell prone, and hurt ourselves badly … The 'Poorbyas' [sepoys from the east] one and all considered themselves to be under the orders of nobody. After their arrival, we kept our houses well guarded.<sup>34</sup>

Zafar's page Zahir Dehlavi was also profoundly alarmed by the outbreak. The King had summoned his attendants to him when he first saw the sepoys approaching. As the streets burned around him, Zahir buckled on his sword

and knife, 'which had lain unused for years', and set out into the chaos to try to obey the Emperor's summons. Outside, Zahir could hear the sound of shooting; at some distance mobs were rampaging, alternately hunting down Christians and looting the richer shops. Steeling his nerve, he mounted his horse and set off through his deserted and shuttered *muhalla* of Matia Mahal and off towards the Jama Masjid.

When I reached the small gate I saw three or four mounted soldiers wearing *kurtas* and *dhotis* and a small scarf tied to their heads, and swords in their belt, standing under the Peepal tree against the canal wall. Hindu men were talking to them and entertaining them, some had brought them newly fried puris, some had brought sweets, some were bringing them water. I did not pay attention to them but passed on towards the fort.

Soon after I saw a mob of *badmashes* led by a big man who looked like a wrestler. He was wearing *kurta dhoti*, a cap on his head, a long bamboo *lathi* on his shoulder, and he was leading a large number of men dressed in the same way. Near the house of Ashraf Beg, the leader hit the road lantern with his bamboo stick and it broke and shattered on the road. He laughed to his friends, and said 'Hey look I have just killed another *kafir'*; then they started breaking the lock of a cloth merchant's shop. I moved quickly on on my horse.

Near the *Kotwali* had gathered a large crowd of miscreants, and all the shops on the way were being looted … The criminals in the city had seen that there was a great opportunity in the unrest, and quickly decided to join the rebels. Full of greed and excitement, they took the rebels to the gate of the bank, brutally killed the men, women and children [of the Beresford family] who were inside, and broke open the treasure trunks and looted the notes inside them. These rebels and rioters were the rebellious soldiers, the criminals who had been freed from the jail and the *chamars* [untouchables and sweepers], loafers, *dhobis* [laundrymen], barbers, butchers and the paper makers of the *Kaghazi Gali*, pick-pockets, wrestlers and other vagabonds. No person from a decent family was a part of this crowd of rioters, for the respectable people of the city were all

locked inside their houses, and were quite unaware of what was going on in the city.

The rioters looted money to their hearts' content. They took away as much as they could carry from the bank, the *chamars*, cobblers and vagabonds taking away three bags of money each, and the residents of the *Kaghazi Gali* were able to pile their homes with the loot as they were just across the wall [from the ruins of the bank]. At least fourteen lakh rupees were looted in the space of an hour. There was rioting all around [Chandni Chowk], people were running amok, blood was flowing like a river, and the rioters were mercilessly creating hell on earth without any guilt or fear, each trying to enrich himself, and not thinking about anyone else.

When I reached the Gate of the Palace, I saw that near the moat of the Fort about fifty mounted men were lined up guarding the entrance. There was a strong breeze and torn pages from an English book were flying towards the Fort …<sup>35</sup>

Anyone who was associated with the old regime was an immediate target. Jiwan Lal, the enormously fat Head Munshi (Chief Secretary) of the British Residency, was at first anxious to do what he could for his employers, hearing how one after another of his friends among the British officials had been hunted down and killed: 'I wept to feel how utterly powerless I was,' he wrote. But he soon realised that his own position was far from secure:

I was a man of corpulent habit of body and well known, so that I could not go out without being discovered … Crowds of badmashes were pointing out to the soldiers the residences of the Europeans and the wealthier natives … Then a man reported that the badmashes were naming me as being the Mir Munshi, and as one worthy of death, and offering to point out my house. Terrified, I ordered the gates to be locked. The house had been built in the days of the [fourteenth-century] Emperor Firoz Shah [Tughluq], and was of solid stone, and as strong as a fort. The doors and windows were all closed. There were underground apartments, into which my family all entered, and there remained concealed. I arranged all the servants for watch and ward, both in front and behind, with orders

to admit no one … The city was panic struck – all houses and shops were closed, their inmates concealed inside, praying to God for his mercy and protection.<sup>36</sup>

Many were looted simply because they were rich. Some of the first targets were Delhi's wealthy but unpopular Marwari and Jain moneylenders, though these were in no way directly connected with the British regime. Immediately after the sepoys entered Delhi, the banking partners Mathura Das and Saligram became among the first victims of the looters: 'The Tilangas assaulted the house of Saligram with the intention of looting it but at first could not loosen the screws,' recorded an anonymous news-writer the following day. 'At midnight the Tilangas finally broke through the gate, along with Muslims of the city, and [together they] looted all the goods of the *kothi.'*<sup>37</sup> The partners, who had previously incurred the enmity of the Palace by having Mirza Shah Rukh seized in an attempt to recover their debts, were forced to come before Zafar begging for protection: 'Your slave's house has been plundered of everything it contained and all it possessed,' they pleaded. 'All our banking and mercantile transactions have been utterly ruined and suspended … We are now with difficulty able to procure even the daily necessities of life.'<sup>38</sup>

Others less wealthy than Saligram suffered a similar fate. According to the Chief of Police, Sa'id Mubarak Shah, 'bodies of sepoys, troopers and others went through the streets plundering and maltreating the respectable citizens'.

In the general confusion a party of eight Ranghuirs [Muslim Rajputs] who had been putting up at the serai assembled a body of dacoits and gutted one whole portion of the town, loaded their camels with gold mohurs, jewellery and other valuables and set out for their village … The plundering continued the whole of that day and night.<sup>39</sup>

Soon so many of the richest havelis had been broken into and looted, usually with the excuse that the inhabitants were sheltering Christians, that Mufti Sadruddin Azurda helped form a private police force to protect himself and his circle. The men he turned to were the only Delhiwallahs

with sufficient arms and military training to take on the sepoys. These were the jihadis of the underground mujahedin network, whose brotherhood, bound to fight the jihad by oaths of allegiance (or *bayat*) to a leader (or *amir*), now cast off their veil of secrecy and began to mass in Delhi, ready for the holy war they had so long dreamt of.\* Before long the jihadis would become a significant force in the Delhi Uprising, operating alongside but quite independently of the rebel sepoys.

Such was the prevalence of jihadi rhetoric at the outbreak that some went so far as to term the sepoys mujahedin, even though the overwhelming majority of them were Brahmins and other highcaste Hindus. Maulvi Muhammad Baqar certainly wrote up the outbreak in his *Dihli Urdu Akbhar* as a jihad. In his view the sepoys were guided by the hand of an angry God, outraged at the attacks made on the true faith by the British. For this reason, unlike most of the educated Delhi elite, Baqar was from the beginning an enthusiastic cheerleader for the Uprising. By eight in the morning he was out on the streets, carefully noting what was happening: 'This humble writer, having heard the sound of gunshots, for the sake of Islam, came out of his house, and caring more for enjoyment and distraction of his readers than for his own life, without hesitation started moving towards the disturbance in order to inquire into the details,' he wrote.

In the Kashmiri bazaar, people were running in large numbers … Several Englishmen with naked swords were running in a frenzy and behind them ran a body of Tilangas with their guns chasing them. Not far behind, the residents of the city, one holding a plank, another the leg of a charpoy, someone else holding a bamboo *lathi* were running after the Tilangas. Some of the city's populace even tried to throw bricks at the Englishmen, shouting and screaming at them …

In front of Fakhr ul-Masajid a motley group of some twenty Tilangas were standing around and people were pointing them towards the mosque [where some of the English had taken sanctuary]. I saw the Tilangas go inside the mosque and there they shot the people and sent them on their journey to the hereafter. Further ahead I saw the Church [St James's] and Collins Saheb's kothi where three hundred Tilangas and Turk Riders [Muslim cavalrymen] were standing.\*

From there, different groups were spreading out, and asking everyone where the English are. If anybody gave any information four or five soldiers would immediately accompany that man, and in no time, in every lane, Christians were found lying dead. They entered each Kothi and killed the Englishmen with their women and children, and all the houses were plundered. All the movables from the Church and Kutcherry, including the chairs and tables and even the marble slabs of the floors were taken away. After a while I saw the corpse of Nixon Saheb, the head clerk of Commissioner's office. Some wit had even placed a biscuit in his mouth …

When I looked towards the Delhi College I saw that all the goods including the portraits, pictures and instruments, chemicals and medicines and a library of English and Persian books as well as maps worth thousands of Rupees were all being taken as loot, and it reached such a pass that even the flooring and the joints of the gates were dug out. The sound of gunfire came from all sides …<sup>40</sup>

In his account of the events of 11 May, Muhammad Baqar remained as much the preacher as the curious journalist and war correspondent. Almost the entire front page of the 17 May edition of the paper was given over to Koranic verses concerning worldly vanity and the power of God, along with a lengthy theological exposition. For Baqar was determined not just to describe what happened, but also to interpret it – and to highlight the divine hand he believed was behind the unprecedented events:

Some people swear that when the Turk troopers came here, there were female camels ahead of them on which rode green-robed riders and then they instantly vanished from sight. Only the troopers remained and they killed whichever Englishman they found …

Truly the English have been afflicted with divine wrath by the true avenger. Their arrogance has brought them divine retribution for, as the Holy Koran says, 'God does not love the arrogant ones.' God has given the Christians such a bodyblow that within a short time this carnage has utterly destroyed them … For He has power over everything, and has overwhelmed all their schemes and ploys. It is now incumbent upon you, people of Delhi, to have faith in God and all those who should expend all their energy in protecting and

being loyal to the Shadow of God on Earth, his Exalted Majesty [the Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar]. They should always remember that they have the help and support of the Almighty himself.<sup>41</sup>

No less excited by the new turn of events was Baqar's twentyseven-year-old son, Muhammad Husain, later to become famous as the poet Azad. The second edition of the paper to be published after the arrival of the sepoys in Delhi, that of 24 May, contained Azad's first-ever published poem, entitled 'A History of Instructive Reversals'. The ghazals began with a series of rhetorical questions – where now was the empire of Alexander? Where the realm of Solomon? – before moving on to the fate of the Christian empire in India, whose days were now so clearly at an end:

> Yesterday the Christians were in the ascendant, World-seizing, world-bestowing, The possessors of skill and wisdom, The possessors of splendour and glory The possessors of a mighty army.

But what use was that, Against the sword of the Lord of Fury? All their wisdom could not save them, Their schemes became useless, Their knowledge and science availed them nothing – The Tilangas of the East have killed them all.

An event such as no one has ever seen or heard of – See how the strange revolutions of the Heavens, Open the eyes of instruction. See how the reality of the world, Has been revealed.

O Azad, learn this lesson: For all their wisdom and vision, The Christian rulers have been erased, Without leaving a trace in this world.<sup>42</sup> Up in the cantonments to the north of the city, the morning of 11 May had started badly. At 8 a.m., when Robert Tytler returned to his bungalow after the morning parade, he had immediately complained to his wife, now seven months pregnant, 'Harrie, my men behaved infamously today.'<sup>43</sup>

He told how, when the commanding officer had read out the sentence passed on their colleagues in Meerut, Tytler's men had 'hissed and shuffled their feet, showing by their actions their sympathy with the sentenced sepoys'. Tytler told his wife he would drill them to their hearts' content if they misbehaved again. 'Little did he dream', commented Harriet in her memoirs, 'that before evening came he would not have one man to drill.'

Although it was only an hour after sunrise, and the *khas* screens in the Tytlers' bungalow were fixed on the outer doors and watered, it was already fiery hot. The couple had had their baths and were just settling down to the first – melon – course of their breakfast; the tailors were out on the veranda, sewing away. Suddenly 'the door flew open and the tailor rushed in with his hands clasped and in a most excited manner said, "Sahib, sahib, the *fauj* [army] has come.'" Tytler explained to his wife that 'those fellows from Meerut have come over and I suppose are kicking up a row in the city. There is nothing to be frightened about, our men will be sent to coerce them, and all will very soon be over'.<sup>44</sup>

Tytler was sent off with two hundred sepoys to guard the new powder magazine recently erected on the Yamuna riverbank to the north of Metcalfe House. Meanwhile Tytler's senior officer, Colonel Ripley, took his regiment down to the Kashmiri Gate, intending to begin rounding up the miscreants. Since there was clearly no time to be lost, and the job of disarming a mob of disorganised mutineers did not sound very demanding, Ripley set off straight away, leaving a young officer named Edward Vibart to bring up the two light cannons that were kept some distance away in the artillery lines.

Vibart was a nineteen-year-old company commander from an Indian army family; his father was a cavalry officer in Kanpur. It took twenty minutes for Vibart to get the guns prepared, after which he galloped as fast as he could from the cantonments down through the Civil Lines. 'We were still some distance off,' he wrote afterwards, 'when the sound of musketry was distinctly heard; and now, as the church came into view, we could plainly see, from the smoke arising around it, that our regiment was actively engaged in the locality.'

Pushing on with all speed we shortly met Captain Wallace coming out of the Kashmir Gate. He implored us for 'God's sake' to hurry on as fast as possible, as all the officers were being shot down by cavalry troopers, and their men were making no efforts to defend them. On hearing the startling news, Major Patterson desired me to halt and load. The two guns then advanced through the gate, followed by the infantry. At this moment, the body of our unfortunate Colonel [Ripley] was carried out, literally hacked to pieces. One arm just below the shoulder was almost severed. Such a fearful sight I never beheld. The poor man was still alive, and though scarcely able to articulate, I distinctly gathered the few words he gasped out, that we had no chance against the cavalry, as our own men had turned against us …

I now entered the Main Guard, and found everything in confusion. In front of the church, a few cavalry troopers in their Frenchgrey uniforms were seen galloping back in the direction of the palace. Lt Wilson brought a gun around to bear on them, but they were out of sight before he had time to fire. As for the men of my own regiment, not a sepoy was to be seen; they had vanished …

At length some of us advanced beyond the inner gates, when the first thing I saw was the lifeless body of Captain Burrowes lying close by the gate of the churchyard. Other bodies were now observed scattered about the place. Five were at length found and brought in … Since then I have witnessed many terrible sights, but I shall never forget my feelings that day as I saw our poor fellows brought in, their faces distorted with all the agonies of a violent death, and hacked about in every conceivable way. Only a couple of hours previously we had been laughing and chatting together …<sup>45</sup>

In the eerie silence, Vibart waited 'in this state of disquietening suspense'. Occasionally stragglers reached this last British outpost in the walled city: these included three of Ripley's officers, who had escaped and hidden down a side street, and the beautiful Annie Forrest, her mother and her two younger sisters – the youngest 'a sweet girl of nine' – all of whom had been sheltered by servants while a mob looted their house. They described seeing the last defence of the Delhi Bank by their friends, the Beresfords: 'on their premises being rushed by the insurgents … these poor people, accompanied

by a few clerks, had descended to the upper balcony of the house, where after a desperate resistance, they were all eventually overpowered. Not one of the party escaped', though Mrs Beresford had skewered no fewer than three of the *sawars* with her husband's pig-sticking spear before she was killed herself.

It was hardly surprising, therefore, according to Vibart, that 'all those ladies who had taken refuge with us remained in the utmost state of alarm', especially when the sepoys with them started muttering that now the time 'had arrived to take their revenge on people who had tried to subvert their caste and religion …'

'Our position here', concluded Vibart, 'can easily be imagined to have been of an exceedingly precarious nature.'<sup>46</sup>

![](_page_20_Picture_3.jpeg)

By lunchtime, virtually all the British people within the city who had not reached Vibart's shaky bridgehead at the Kashmiri Gate had been killed. One of the few still alive was the British merchant James Morley.

Morley lived with his family, and that of his business partner William Clark, in the Bazaar Kashmir Katra in Daryaganj. As their area of the city was one of the first to rise up, the family had hidden in the back of their house while the servants went and kept watch at the gate in case of trouble. But the mob drifted off to loot elsewhere and for a full three hours nothing further happened. As no news had reached the family, Morley eventually decided to go out and investigate whether escape was now an option. 'I took a thick stick in my hand and walked into the street,' he wrote later.

It was altogether empty. I continued to walk down it without meeting anyone … There was only one old man sitting in a shop door. I stood for some time, but at some distance I could see what seemed to be a crowd of men. It was very far off, and I could only just hear the noise and shouting. As I thought they might come up to our house, I stood watching them for some time. At length I

heard a great noise behind, and looking around, I saw a large crowd rushing into my gateway. They had also seen me and some men came rushing down the street towards me. I immediately ran down the street to my left. I knew that there was a small lane that led to [the rear of] my house.

I was running along when two men ran out of another lane, and calling out '*mar feringee ko*,' [kill the foreigner] they rushed at me. One man had a sword in his hand and the other a lathee. I stopped suddenly, and turning quickly round, I gave the man with the sword a blow over the head which brought him to the ground. The other man aimed a blow at my head, but I had stooped forward, and the lathee only grazed my shoulder. I swung my stick round and it caught him just below the knee, which made him sit down howling with pain.<sup>47</sup>

Morley saw a mob collecting behind him so ran on, eventually hiding in a shed used for storing carts. Groups of men passed up and down the street looking for him; from his hiding place he could hear various passers-by discussing in which direction they thought he had run off. For four hours he hid, then crept out, determined to try to discover the fate of his wife and family.

At length I came to the wall of the garden below our house and I entered through a small wicket … everything was as still as death. All around were lying broken chairs, tumblers, plates, books, & c. that had been thrown out from the house. There were some bundles of clothes lying burning … At length I heard a noise, as if someone was crying near the cow house. I went there and found it was our old dhobi [washerman] an old man who had been in my father's service for nearly twenty years. I called out his name and when he saw me he burst out louder saying 'Oh! Sahib! They have killed them all – they have killed them all.'

I felt as if I had been stunned for some time. I then got up and I said, 'come into the house with me' … Everywhere things were lying about that had been most wantonly destroyed. Tables had been split in pieces with hatchets, cupboards had been emptied out

and everything strewn on the floor. Jams and jellies were lying in heaps, and there was an overpowering smell from the brandy and wine that had run out from the broken bottles.

Every minute detail is distinctly imprinted upon my mind, for with that cowardly shrinking from a knowledge of the worst which is common to us all, I lingered in the outer room and kept looking around it. At length I nerved myself and stepped into the next room. Just before, pinned to the wall was poor Clark's little son with his head hanging down, and a black stream of blood trickling down the wall in a large black pool which lay near his feet. And this cruel death must have been inflicted before his mother's eyes. I closed my eyes and shuddered, but opened them again upon an even more dreadful sight. Clark and his wife lay side by side. But I will not, I could not, describe the scene. I have said she was far advanced in pregnancy.

I heard an exclamation and going into the bedroom near the hall, I saw the old dhobi wringing his hands and crying. I rushed to the door but I could not enter. I could not face that spectacle. I could not bear to think that I might see my poor wife as I had just seen poor Mrs Clark. I just sat down, and placed my hands on my knees.<sup>48</sup>

Muin ud-Din Husain Khan was the *thanadar* or head police officer, at Paharganj police station, a little to the south-west of the walled city.

Muin ud-Din was from a minor branch of the noble Loharu family, who had risen to eminence in Delhi after supporting the British against the Marathas at the beginning of the nineteenth century; his cousins included both Ghalib and Nawab Zia ud-Din Khan, who had gone to warn the Wagentriebers of impending trouble on the previous night.

Strongly linked to the British cause, and an old family friend of both Sir Thomas and Theo Metcalfe, he had been alarmed by the reports of the puris

and chapattis passing through the villages surrounding Delhi, and the tales of British houses having gone up in flames in cantonments around northern India. Yet despite going to see Theo, and warning him that similar signals had heralded the collapse of Maratha power half a century earlier, he found that his efforts had been in vain: 'The officers of the government seemed to attach no importance to the matter,' he wrote later, 'and [they] paid no heed to what we regarded as significant warnings of the spirit of disaffection which was spreading far and wide over the country.'<sup>49</sup>

In the early morning of Monday the 11th, Muin ud-Din had been engaged in a criminal case at the Kutcherry courts with the chief magistrate, John Ross Hutchinson. He had been present when the Darogah of the Yamuna Bridge had run in to warn Hutchinson of the imminent arrival of the troops from Meerut, and had been sent by Hutchinson to alert the city kotwal of the danger. While there he had heard a messenger from the Rajghat Gate announcing the arrival of the sepoys within the city. Realising the danger, he had galloped to Hutchinson to report the news, before heading back to his own police station through the Ajmeri Gate. He was still busy arming and preparing his own constabulary when a lone, dishevelled European rode up wearing only 'his shirt and underdraws'. It was Theo Metcalfe.<sup>50</sup>

Theo did not know how long he had been unconscious, but in the chaos no one had noticed him lying prostrate in the ditch; moreover, his horse was still grazing not far away. He had leaped on to the saddle and with an unsheathed sword in his hand had galloped out of the Ajmeri Gate, one of the last Christians to make his escape.<sup>51</sup>

Muin ud-Din rushed Theo inside the police *thana* before he could be seen, and quickly dressed him in his own Hindustani clothes. He then sent out horsemen to see whether the road to the cantonments was open. They returned only a few minutes later, visibly frightened, reporting that the road was already completely occupied by a mob who were busy looting all they could.

Muin ud-Din and Theo therefore set off by small side lanes through the outer suburbs, hoping to avoid the worst of the trouble. But they had not got far before they realised that there was simply going to be no safe way of getting through, and it was agreed that it would be best for Theo to take shelter. Muin ud-Din chose the house of a local landowner called Bhura

Khan Mewati, and advised Theo to keep himself out of sight until the worst of the trouble had passed and the soldiers from the cantonments had brought the situation under control.

Muin ud-Din left Theo there and returned to his police post, where he too shed his uniform and changed into Hindustani clothes. He then rode into the city, through the unguarded city gates, checked on the safety of his terrified family, and then headed off towards the Fort, determined to report for duty to the Emperor in the absence of any British authorities.

As he rode through the closed shops of the Chauri Bazaar, he reflected how 'the suddenness of the inroad of a handful of men created such panic … Ignorance of the strength of the mutineers, and exaggerated reports of their numbers [had] quite paralyzed' the city elite and prevented them taking any measures to resist or even limit the anarchy. In less than two hours, the great and prosperous city had been turned into a war zone:

The principal executive officers of the government were dead. Every man thought [only] of his own safety and that of his family and property … On every side the scum of the population was hurrying to and fro, laden with the plunder of European houses. Arriving at the central police station, I found it plundered even to the doors, which had been carried off.<sup>52</sup>

Inside, Muin ud-Din found two policemen cowering in the ruins. They told him how two *sawars* had ridden up and called out, 'Are you all here for your religion or against it?' When the kotwal had replied, 'We are all for our religion,' the convicts had been let loose by the *sawars*. Shortly after this, 'two men mounted on camels and dressed in green with red turbans rode by at a trot, calling out, "Hear, ye people, the drum of religion has sounded." Whence they had come or whither they went, my informant knew not, but the excited and terrified crowds in the streets believed they were heavenly messengers'. Then the convicts returned from the blacksmith's, and having had their fetters struck off, proceeded to storm the police station and ransack its contents.<sup>53</sup>

The Red Fort, when he reached it, was no less chaotic. 'The place was untenanted and deserted,' wrote Muin ud-Din. Walking through the empty courts, he reached the *tasbih khana*, and persuaded the two remaining

eunuchs on duty to let him see Zafar. 'I begged the king to stop this [plunder] and arrange a restoration of order. The king replied: "I am helpless; all my attendants have lost their heads or fled. I remain here alone. I have no force to obey my orders: what can I do?"'<sup>54</sup>

Muin ud-Din asked Zafar whether he had any orders, and the Emperor sent him off accompanied by two of his *chobdars* (mace bearers) to Daryaganj to try to rescue any Christians he could find, promising to shelter them in the Palace. 'I and the chobdars loudly proclaimed the orders of the king [that the killing should cease],' wrote Muin ud-Din,

and our interference was so far effectual, that the lives of some dozen persons were spared. They were sent to the palace and confined in the *chhota khasa* apartments, and orders were given to feed them. Until late afternoon I laboured, going from bungalow to bungalow, hoping to find someone still living whom I might rescue. A few Christians only were found alive and taken to the palace."<sup>55</sup>

By four o'clock Muin ud-Din had found nineteen more survivors, and sent them over to the Emperor. But as the day progressed, and as an increasing number of ragged sepoys rode and walked into the Fort from Meerut, the chaos and tension in the Palace grew worse. When Zahir Dehlavi arrived shortly after Muin ud-Din – at about 11 a.m. – he found that on Zafar's orders Hakim Ahsanullah Khan was supervising one of the Palace tailors, who was cutting out burial shrouds for Fraser, Douglas and the Jennings family; other courtiers were gathering, ready to obey Zafar's orders that the entire Fort should participate in the funeral rites of the murdered men. At that moment, a group of cavalry *sawars* galloped menacingly and unbidden into the private courtyards of the King – the area beyond the Red Curtain (or *Lal Pardah*):

Hakeem Ahsanullah Khan saw them and said that we should all say the *Fatiha* [prayers for the dead] as the moment of our death has arrived. We all started reciting, as the mounted men neared the Hall of Private Audience, the *Diwan e-Khas*. They got down from their horses, tethered them and walked straight inside without taking off their boots. Altogether they must have been thirty men, and they were wearing long *kurtas*, loose *paijamas* and turbans. Some had

carbines, others had pistols. When they saw the long white shrouds spread out, they turned to Hakeem Ahsanullah Khan and asked him, 'What is this?' The Hakeem replied, 'This is a consequence of what you have done, and the murders you and your admirers have perpetrated.' To this the soldiers spat, 'You are little better than infidel Christians.'\* Saying this, they ripped up all shrouds which were being prepared, tearing them to pieces.

One of the sawars then put the pistol in the belly of the royal Eunuch [and chamberlain] Mahbub Ali Khan, and told him to get them supplies. Mahbub Ali Khan said 'how can I provide you with supplies when we do not have any?' Hakeem Ahsanullah Khan backed him up, saying, 'Our Majesty has admitted himself that he does not have any money: he is living almost like a beggar. Where should we get the supplies? We get enough grain for a month for the horses in the royal stable. Go ahead and take that, but how long will that last? It will be sufficient for you for one day.'

The soldiers went to the King's own garden, Mahtab Bagh, and there they tied up their horses. Soon after another group of soldiers, this time sixty in number, came asking for supplies. They were also given the same offer, then again another fifty arrived. Soon about three hundred of them had collected in the Mahtab Bagh.<sup>56</sup>

From the point of view of the courtiers, the arrival of the sepoys was an invasion: the last time that large numbers of soldiers had poured unbidden into the Red Fort was when Ghulam Qadir seized the Palace in 1783, blinding the then Emperor, when Zafar was only eight. Since then it had been unheard of for anyone to pass the Red Curtain on horseback, or to approach the Diwan i-Khas without removing their shoes. When the British Resident, Francis Hawkins, had done so in 1830, during Akbar Shah's annual holiday in Mehrauli, the Emperor had complained to Calcutta about the 'offensive and disrespectful act' and demanded that steps be taken 'to wipe off the dust of grief and affliction from the polished mirror of our enlightened and resplendent mind'; Hawkins was promptly dismissed.<sup>57</sup> Now several hundred unwashed and dirty ex-Company sepoys had come and billeted themselves without consultation in the inner apartments of the Palace, and had stabled their horses among the fruit trees of the Emperor's favourite garden.

Towards early afternoon, around three o'clock, the situation grew yet more tense, as the sepoys gathering in the Palace began to get restive, and came to collect again around Zafar's private apartments. They had clearly expected the Emperor to shower them in gold for coming and offering service. Instead, they had received a mixed reception in the city and an openly hostile one in the Palace. Moreover, despite their having come all the way to Delhi to seek the shelter of the Emperor, Zafar had not been seen since the first party of troopers shouted up to him in the early morning. So at around 4 p.m. their leaders sent word to the King that they had come 'to fight for our religion and to pay our respects to His Majesty'.<sup>58</sup> When this again failed to produce the Emperor, the soldiers massed in the courtyard in front of the Diwan i-Khas and 'commenced firing their muskets, pistols and carbines in the air, making a great clamour', according to Ghulam Abbas, Zafar's vakil (attorney).

The King hearing the noise, came out, and, standing at the door of the Hall of Special Audience, told his attendants to direct the troops to discontinue the noise they were making. He told them to call the native officers forward, that they might explain the object of such proceedings. On this the noise was quelled, and the officers of the cavalry came forward, mounted as they were. They explained that they had been required to bite cartridges, the use of which deprive both Hindus and Mahomedans of their religion, as the cartridges were greased with pork and beef fat, that they accordingly had killed the Europeans at Meerut, and had come to claim his protection.

The King replied, 'I did not call for you; you have acted very wickedly.' On this about one or two hundred of the mutinous infantry, ascended the steps and came into the hall, saying that 'unless you, the King, join us, we are all dead men, and we must in that case just do what we can for ourselves.'

Zafar argued with the troopers for a while – something unheard of in a normal durbar – admonishing them for the murders they had perpetrated, so that 'the court of the palace became a scene of the wildest confusion, quarrelling and disputes'.59 As the nobleman Abdul Latif put it,

The king was like the king on the chessboard after the checkmate. For a long time he acted with the utmost restraint and then said: 'Why is an old soul like me being subjected to such humiliating behaviour? And what is the reason of this noise? The sun of our life has already reached its evening. These are our last days. All I wish for is retreat and seclusion.'<sup>60</sup>

The courtiers were furious at the behaviour of the rebels and argued with the sepoys. But they were silenced by the mob and they had to return to their places. Ahsanullah Khan told the sepoys: '"You have long been accustomed under the English rule to regular pay. The King has no treasury. How can he pay you?" The officers replied, "We will bring the revenue of the whole Empire to your treasury."'<sup>61</sup> For a while Zafar continued to argue with the sepoys, telling them:' "I have neither troops, magazine or treasury. I am not in a condition to join anyone." They said, "Only give us your blessing. We will provide everything else."'<sup>62</sup>

There was then a long pause while Zafar considered his options. For all his many good qualities, indecision was always Zafar's greatest vice. Emily Eden relates a telling anecdote from her visit to Delhi in 1838 when Zafar, then the heir apparent, 'was coaxed or threatened into waiting on' her brother, the Governor General, Lord Auckland. Unable to make up his mind whether to attend or not, Zafar had taken to his bed and sent a succession of no fewer than 'thirteen doctors to say he was too ill to come'. He dithered backwards and forwards all afternoon before 'he changed his mind yet again and came, and in the meanwhile, half our troops who were out for the durbar were fainting away from the heat'.<sup>63</sup> Likewise, when Zafar had had his spat with Mirza Fakhru in 1852, he oscillated week to week, one day banning his eldest son from the durbar and forbidding any of the courtiers from having contact with him, then the next he would declare his love for the Mirza and tell the members of the court that they need have no fear of befriending him or attending his monsoon parties.<sup>64</sup>

Yet now, at the moment of the most crucial decision Zafar would ever take, with most of the Delhi elite already instinctively lined up against the looting, mutinous sepoys, Zafar made an uncharacteristically decisive choice: he gave them his blessing. The reason is not hard to guess. With the armed, threatening and excitable sepoys surrounding him on all sides, he

had little choice. Moreover, thanks to Simon Fraser and Lord Canning, he had even less to lose. For all his undoubted fear, anger and irritation with the sepoys, Zafar made the critical choice that would change both the fate of his dynasty and that of the city of Delhi, linking them both with the Uprising:

The King then seated himself in a chair, and the soldiery, officers and all, came forward one by one, bowed their heads before him, asking him to place his hand on them. The King did so, and each withdrew … Picketing their horses in the courtyard, the troops took up their quarters [in the Palace and across the bridge in the old Mughal Bastille of Salimgarh] and spread their bedding in the Hall of Audience, and placed guards all about the palace.<sup>65</sup>

It was at this crucial moment, when the King had just publicly – if hesitantly and reluctantly – given his blessing to the mutineers, and they were settling down into quarters inside the Palace, that the entire city was shaken by a colossal explosion, a report that could be heard 20 miles away. Buildings shook; in the Palace several plaster ceilings collapsed.

Half a mile to the north of the Red Fort, Theo's friend Lieutenant Willoughby, besieged by sepoys, had just blown up the magazine, the largest arsenal of guns and ammunition in northern India; and with it the large mob of jihadis, insurgents and sepoys who were attacking it, as well as almost all of its British defenders.

![](_page_29_Picture_4.jpeg)

Far to the north, beyond Metcalfe House, Captain Robert Tytler spent most of 11 May unaware of the fate of his fellow countrymen, or the dramatic political revolution then taking place in the Palace.

Sent with a company of 200 sepoys to guard the new powder magazine and the Yamuna ford at a large army building known as the White House, a little to the north-east of the cantonments, Tytler knew that all was not well,

but remained quite ignorant of the extent of the reverses fast destroying British rule in and around Delhi.

He knew that his men had shown their sympathies for the sepoys in Meerut when the sentences had been read out on parade; he knew that the men had been 'excitable' when the news had come that the Meerut sepoys had reached Delhi 'shouting vehemently every now and then' as he prepared them to march; and he had seen that when he handed out ammunition to his men some had grabbed far more than their entitlement and he had mentally marked down the guilty men for punishment at a later date. But isolated as he was in his remote position, no precise news had reached him of what was going on, although looking downstream, he could plainly see the smoke rising from within the city, and hear the faint report of musketry and cannon.

By early afternoon, he and his colleague Captain Gardner had noticed that the sepoys were refusing to come within the shelter of the White House, and were instead forming into small groups in the heat of the sun. 'I ordered them to come in and not expose themselves thus,' he wrote later.

They said, 'we like being in the sun.' I ordered them in again. [No one moved.] I then remarked for the first time a native – from his appearance, a soldier – haranguing the men and saying that every power or Government existed its allotted time, and that it was nothing extraordinary that that of the English had come to an end, according to what had been predicted in their books. Before I could make a prisoner of him, the magazine in the city exploded, and the men of the two companies with a tremendous shout took up their arms and ran off to the city, exclaiming, 'Prithviraj ki jai!' or 'Victory to the Sovereign of the World!' Captain Gardner and myself rushed after them, and ordered those within hearing to return to their post; when orders failed, entreaties were resorted to, but proved of no avail.<sup>66</sup>

Tytler found himself with only eighty sepoys left, 'chiefly old soldiers that had served with me in Afghanistan', and felt 'quite at a loss how to act and what to do'. Minutes later, however, urgent orders arrived by messenger that Tytler should join his brigadier at the Flagstaff Tower in the centre of the Ridge overlooking the walled city.

The Flagstaff Tower was a scene of great confusion when Tytler finally reached it. In the course of the day, this short, isolated round tower situated on the summit of the barren Ridge had become the place of refuge for all the remaining British families from the cantonment and the Civil Lines, as well as those few who had managed to escape from the walled city. These included Tytler's wife Harriet, who was uncharacteristically flustered and weeping, feeling the weight of her advanced pregnancy: unflappable as she usually was, her steely composure had finally broken when her little fouryear-old son Frank had asked her, 'Mamma, will these naughty sepoys kill my papa, and will they kill me too?' Also within the tower were the entire Wagentrieber clan, whose patriarch George had that morning had a narrow escape from the rebel sepoys at the Kashmiri Gate on his way to the nowransacked premises of the *Delhi Gazette*.

Outside the tower stood two light field guns overseen by Brigadier Graves and the Delhi judge Charles Le Bas, the only survivor from the group of men who had closed the Calcutta Gate earlier that morning. Under their orders were a company of scowling and clearly disaffected sepoys, and the Anglo-Indian orphans from the Christian Boys' Band, whose annual wheelbarrow race had for several years been one of the highlights of the Delhi Derby, but who had now been pressed into active military service. They had been issued with muskets, and were now standing on guard behind the battlements on the top of the tower.

Crushed inside were the massed womenfolk of the station, several of whom had just been told that their husbands, sons or brothers had been killed. Equally distraught was one of the few European soldiers present, Charlie Thomason, Padre Jennings' prize tenor, who had been carried to the tower from his sickbed in the cantonments, only to be told that his fiancée, Annie Jennings, had been murdered in the Palace.

The single interior room of the tower was only 18 feet in diameter, windowless and stuffy at the best of times; at the height of the hot season it was like an oven. Worse still, for their safety, many of the women had been sent up a suffocating interior staircase, as a result of which several had fainted.<sup>67</sup> But more distressing even than the discomfort, the heat and the lack of water was the suspense. Over the course of the day, successive reports brought ever worse news of the British position, with reversal following reversal, death following death, and the prospects of relief from

the British regiments in Meerut growing progressively more remote. According to the young Florence Wagentrieber,

Ladies and children [as well as] servants, male and female, were all huddled together in utter confusion. Many ladies were in a miserable condition from the extreme heat and nervous excitement, little ones crying and clinging to their mothers. Here were wives made widows, sisters weeping at the report of a brother's death, and some whose husbands were still on duty in the midst of the disaffected sepoys, of whose fate they were as yet ignorant … There was not a tree near the tower to shelter it from the hot sun … the heat was unbearable and the children were stripped of every garment.<sup>68</sup>

Arriving into this heaving pandemonium, Tytler could see immediately that the isolated tower was quite indefensible, and that to mass the women and children in such a spot was to invite a further and much larger massacre than that which had already taken place within the walls of the city. Without hesitation, he marched straight up to Brigadier Graves and, according to the account of his wife Harriet, asked 'in a very clear and audible voice':

'Excuse me sir, but what are you going to do?'

He replied: 'Stay here Tytler, and protect the women and children.'

My husband said in a most emphatic manner, 'It's madness sir, have you any food?'

'No, Tytler.'

'Have you any water?'

'No, Tytler.'

'Then how do you propose protecting the women and children?'

'What can we do? If we put out our heads they will shoot us down.'

My husband said, 'Look here gentlemen … We cannot hold our post, therefore it is our duty to form a retreat.'

The officers called out, 'For God's sake, don't listen to Tytler.' My husband then said, 'Very well gentlemen, do as you like, stay here and be butchered, but I will go with my family and stand my

court martial. I will not stand to see my wife and children butchered."<sup>69</sup>

As Tytler was speaking, a single bullock cart appeared at the foot of the slope and slowly creaked up the incline of the Ridge from the Kashmiri Gate. Inside, under a thin covering of women's dresses stained with blood, lay the mangled and mutilated bodies of all the British officers murdered as they entered the city earlier in the morning; the sister of one of the victims, Miss Burrowes, stood perspiring inside the tower. The cart had in fact been sent up by Edward Vibart to the cantonment, and by mistake found its way to the Flagstaff Tower; but it was taken by the edgy and nervous refugees as an act of intimidation by the sepoys. Although that had not been the original intention of the sender, it certainly had that effect.

On seeing the bodies, Tytler's remaining sepoys urged their captain to flee if they were to avoid the same fate, telling him that the Meerut *sawars* were currently resting their horses in the nearby Ochterlony Gardens: 'They expect you to stay here all night, and will come and kill you at their leisure,' the sepoys told Tytler.\*

At this the nerve of the frightened crowd finally broke. As soon as the Brigadier and his officers heard of the fate awaiting them,' wrote Harriet Tytler, 'they realised how near their end had come, and then there was indeed a stampede. Everyone rushed to their carriage to see who could get off first.'<sup>70</sup>

![](_page_33_Picture_4.jpeg)

As the day progressed, Edward Vibart's position at the main guard just inside the Kashmiri Gate of the walled city became increasingly untenable.

At one o'clock, the 200 missing sepoys of Vibart's regiment suddenly turned up again. They justified running away and leaving their officers to their fate earlier that morning by saying that they had been unarmed and taken by surprise by the mutineers, immediately as they entered Kashmiri Gate. Vibart was unsure whether this was true, and noticed 'that although

the demeanour of the men was outwardly respectful, they stood about in groups talking to each other in undertones. One sepoy of my company refused to go on sentry duty when ordered to do so; he roughly disengaged himself and slunk back into the crowd. All this was very disquietening, and boded no good'.

At first, Vibart had kept up communication with both Lieutenant Willoughby at the magazine and Arthur Galloway, the Assistant Magistrate, who had refused to leave his post a short distance away in the Kutcherry building, just the other side of St James's Church. By mid-afternoon, however, Galloway had been killed by his own disaffected Kutcherry Guard, while Willoughby had blown up the magazine to prevent its contents falling into the hands of the mutineers, the 'terrific explosion shaking the foundations of the Main Guard to its centre'. By now Vibart and his companions felt insufficiently confident even to intervene to halt the looting of the church 200 yards in front of their position, 'the cushions and stools even being borne off by the rascally populace without let or hindrance'.<sup>71</sup>

The spirits of the defenders were momentarily lifted when Willoughby and his assistant, Lieutenant Forrest, father to the three Misses Forrest, appeared at the gate, 'begrimed with dust and powder, and the latter badly wounded in the hand from a musket ball'; some other badly singed and disabled sergeants from the magazine limped in shortly afterwards. But the signs of disaffection among the sepoys guarding the gate were now becoming unmistakable, and they began to refuse all orders. Two cannons that had been sent up to the Ridge with a guard of sepoys and two English officers returned after half an hour with the two officers mysteriously missing. When asked why they had returned, and what had happened to their officers, the men gave evasive replies. Meanwhile 'sepoys kept entering the enclosure in groups of threes and four, and we could observe our men getting very restless and uneasy', wrote Vibart.

At this critical juncture some sepoys rushed at the gate and closed it; their next act was to discharge a volley right amongst a group of officers, and their example was rapidly followed by all the other sepoys inside the enclosure … I saw Captain Gordon fall from his horse … The horrible truth now flashed on me – we were being massacred right and left, without any means of escape. Scarcely knowing what I was doing, I made for the ramp which leads from

the courtyard to the bastion above. Everyone seemed to be doing the same. Twice I was knocked over as we all rushed up the slope, the bullets whistling past us like hail, and flattening themselves against the parapet with a frightful hiss. Poor Smith and Reveley, were killed close beside me. The latter was carrying a loaded gun, and, raising himself with a dying effort, he discharged both barrels into a knot of sepoys, and the next moment expired.<sup>72</sup>

At the top of the slope, Vibart looked down from the castellations of the bastion. Below lay a 25-foot drop into the ditch below – 'one would have thought it madness at any other time'.<sup>73</sup> Several other officers made the jump, and began trying to run up the almost vertical counterscarp. Vibart was about to join them when the screams of the Misses Forrest rang out from the officers' quarters across the bastion. Their mother had just been wounded in the shoulder. Vibart ran over to where they were – 'bullets all this while whistling through the windows' – and helped them over to the parapet. The officers fastened their sword belts together, and with the help of Vibart and their father, one by one lowered the girls down.

There still remained 'one very stout old lady' who began to scream, and refused to jump. By this point, the sepoys below had a cannon trained upon them, and a shot 'crashed into the parapet a little to the right, covering us with splinters. It was madness to waste time in expostulation', wrote Vibart; 'somebody gave her a push and she tumbled headlong in the ditch beneath'.<sup>74</sup>

One by one, the ten survivors – five men and five women – then attempted to scale the top of the counterscarp. 'Again and again did the ladies almost reach the top, when the earth, crumbling away beneath their feet, sent them rolling back into the ditch. Despair, however, gave us superhuman energy, till at length we all succeeded in gaining the summit. We now ran down the short glacis, and plunged into some thick shrubbery that grew at the bottom.'

As darkness fell, the survivors made their way through thick scrub towards the river, and then upstream towards Metcalfe House. On the way, they saw that they were being followed.

Not waiting, however, to take a second look, we set off running hoping to reach the house before our pursuers overtook us … Thorny bushes tore the ladies' dresses to shreds. On we ran, the perspiration streaming down our faces, our lips parched with thirst, and not daring to look behind us.<sup>75</sup>

It was pitch dark by the time they reached Metcalfe House. The house was surrounded 'by a crowd of suspicious-looking individuals', but the refugees were kindly received by the staff, who were anxious to know the fate of Theo, who had not been seen since that morning. They were all taken down to the darkness of Sir Thomas's cool underground billiard room, where the three Misses Forrests promptly fell fast asleep. In due course candles, food and bottles of beer all appeared. Mrs Forrest's wound was dressed, and for three hours everyone rested.

By nine o'clock, however, the staff warned that it was only a matter of time before the sepoys appeared from the cantonments, from which direction, only a short distance away, could be heard 'the shouts of the mutineers, mingled with volleys of musketry and discharges of cannon'. Filling their pockets with food and bottles of water, the party set off again. The plan was to ford the Yamuna canal, and head off north-east crosscountry, in the hope of reaching the British regiments at Meerut, 38 miles away. 'Each of us took charge of a lady,' wrote Vibart,

and I had little Miss Forrest to my share. The poor little child kept asking all sorts of innocent questions, not being able to realise the fearful events that had occurred. In this manner we trudged on for about half an hour, when suddenly a bright streak of fire rose up behind us.

They had left only just in time. A little downstream, the eerie colours reflected in the dark waters of the Yamuna, Metcalfe House was ablaze.

By the fall of darkness, as the Muslim faithful paused to eat their *iftar*, the sunset Ramadan meal, the streets of Delhi were deserted again. Zahir Dehlavi, returning from the Fort, passed through a scene of devastation: 'When I reached the Urdu Bazar road [next to the Jama Masjid]', he wrote,

it was completely quiet, and there was not a single bird to be heard or seen. Indeed there was a strange silence over the whole town, as if the city had turned suddenly into a wilderness. Shops were lying looted, the doors of all the houses and havelis were closed, and there was not a glimmer of light. Even the glass of the street lanterns lay broken. I went past the *Kotwali* and reached the gate of the small *Dariba* [in Chandni Chowk]. There I saw all the shops of the knife makers, sweet sellers and cloth merchants were all broken and looted, and in front of the silver merchant's shop, a Brahmin beggar lay dying. He was still groaning, and on his back were three gaping wounds from swords. Finally I reached my house [in Matia Mahal]. It was only late evening now but already the door was closed, locked and bolted.<sup>76</sup>

What remained of the British community in Delhi was now in full flight. James Morley had spent the evening hiding in the dhobi's hut, listening to his servants discussing the murder of his wife and family – and his presumed death – outside. One man said it was very wrong to kill the memsahib and the children, and how were they going to get *rozgar* [employment]? But another said that we were *kafirs*, and now the King of Delhi would provide for everyone.' With the dhobi's assistance, Morley made his escape, dressed in the dhobi's wife's petticoat and veil. 'I had been all my life in the country,' wrote Morley, 'but still I felt afraid lest anyone should speak to me. I did not know if they might remark that my *chadar* was held awkwardly and thus find me out.' But they drove safely out of the city, past the unguarded city gates, sitting on the dhobi's bullock cart beside a pile of dirty washing.

Despite the late hour, the road was full of excited crowds hurrying into Delhi to loot, or else returning laden with plunder. At one point, a gang of men surrounded them and accused the dhobi of hiding treasures in the washing, but the old man coolly told them to search it, and, finding nothing, they let them go. After that the dhobi fended off further crowds by telling

anyone they met to hurry on and loot the *firangis* before it was too late. As dawn came, they found shelter in a *dharmashala* next to a roadside temple.<sup>77</sup>

Robert and Harriet Tytler, meanwhile, were heading in an overloaded carriage up the road to Karnal. Like every other British attempt to guide events that day, the flight from the Flagstaff Tower had started badly and soon descended into complete chaos. Tytler had planned a retreat that would have taken the women and children on the road to Meerut via the ford at Baghpat to the north-east. Almost immediately, however, the column had become fragmented, with half of the carriages setting off towards Baghpat while the others headed off in the wrong direction towards the cantonments. In the panic and confusion, Tytler lost his remaining sepoys, became separated from his wife, and ran into a body of Gujar tribesmen who had just come in from their village to join in the looting. They made a dash at Tytler with their iron-bound lathis, and tried to unhorse him; Tytler only just made it through.

Tytler eventually caught up with Harriet and his children, who had headed off on the wrong road in a carriage accompanied by the wife of his colleague Captain Gardner. But when Mrs Gardner asked him what had happened to her husband, Tytler volunteered to go back and look for him. Gardner, it transpired, had failed to leave with the rest of the party, and was limping wounded through the burning cantonments when Tytler eventually found him. Twice more he passed through the midst of the Gujars, once on the way back to look for his friend, and one final time, with the wounded Gardner riding pillion behind him; each time the Gujars struck the men with their lathis and tried to pull them off.<sup>78</sup>

Catching up with the carriage a second time, Tytler jumped on to it, and the party galloped forwards, Tytler driving the horses 'at a terrific pace', conscious that the *sawar* cavalry could by now have started after them in pursuit. 'We had not gone far', wrote Harriet, 'before Gardner called out, "Tytler look back."'<sup>79</sup>

We cast our eyes in the direction of the cantonments and saw that every bungalow and the lines were on fire. It was a sickening sight, knowing that all we most valued was lost to us for ever, things that no money could ever purchase – a beloved dead child's hair, manuscripts and paintings, books, clothes, furniture, a very large

carriage, horses, buggy etc. Indeed we lost in money value, with my husband's uniform some £20,000, a fortune to a poor military man in those days … But the one absorbing thought of flying for our lives soon made us forget that which at any other time would have been an inconsolable trial.<sup>80</sup>

![](_page_39_Picture_1.jpeg)

The Wagentriebers, in contrast to the fleeing Tytlers, decided to take their chances in the Delhi suburbs and to fall back on the friends of Elizabeth Wagentrieber's father, James Skinner.

After Nawab Zia ud-Din Khan had visited them the previous evening they felt confident they could rely on his friendship, so from the Flagstaff Tower they made straight for the Nawab's garden house to the north-west of the tower, a little way up the Karnal road, which the Nawab had often offered to them for weekends.

On arrival, they were warmly received by the mali (gardener). A goat was milked for Elizabeth Wagentrieber's baby, and a meal of chapattis and vegetables prepared. The carriage and horses were hidden away, all traces of the wheels were rubbed out, and the harnesses hidden in the house. George Wagentrieber went up on to the roof with his stepdaughter Julia, the young infant Florence and with the guns they had brought, while Elizabeth stayed below on a charpoy with the *chaukidar* (nightwatchman), covering her face in a chador. She told the surly-looking *chaukidar* that if he gave any hint of betraying them in any way, her husband had his guns trained on him and would make sure to shoot him first.<sup>81</sup>

The moon rose, and from the rooftop George could see fires burning all over Delhi and the cantonments ablaze; he could also hear the sound of repeated musket shots and the louder reports of field guns. Soon after the rattle of the last of the English carriages had passed up the Karnal road, troops of cavalry started to appear at the gate searching for Christians. 'My mother had told the chaukidar not to show any objections to people wanting to come in as that would at once make them suspicious,' remembered Julia.

She would not let the chaukidar go near the gate or trust him away from her. Twice the rebels came to the gate, and hailed the chaukidar, asking him if he had given shelter to the *Firangis*. The last one, a trooper, came to within a few yards of where she was sitting, reined in his horse, and asked to be shown all over the house. But the chaukidar obeyed the injunctions my mother had given him and told the man that some Europeans had come past but they did not stay, and drove straight up the road, and that he was welcome to go all over the house if he chose. The man's prompt reply seemed to satisfy the trooper who immediately rode off in search of those who were said to have gone past.<sup>82</sup>

Towards midnight, however, reports began to reach the house that someone had betrayed the Wagentriebers, and that a further troop of twenty *sawars* were on their way. There seemed no option but immediate flight. Elizabeth harnessed the horses, and drove them to the front of the house; the children were put inside and George climbed on the box. 'Before we entered upon the high road,' wrote George,

my dear wife advised me to keep my fire arms at hand, so I took a double-barrelled gun loaded with ball, and my pistol on the box with me, leaving two rifles inside: and telling my step-daughter, who was inside the carriage with the child, to hand them [to me] the moment I fired, we commended ourselves to the protection of the Most High, and entered upon the Grand Trunk Road.<sup>83</sup>

The Tytlers had gone only about 15 miles from Delhi when their horse began to slow down with exhaustion. Stopping at a staging stable of the government *dak* or postal service, they were refused a replacement horse, until Tytler drew a gun on the official and took one by force.

A few miles after leaving the stables, the wheels of their overloaded carriage all simultaneously disintegrated, leaving 'the body of the carriage a hopeless wreck. There was nothing for it but to walk'. Each of the men took a child; their two heavily pregnant wives, and Harriet's maid Marie, trudged on behind them, expecting to hear at any moment the clatter of the hoofs of the cavalry bearing down upon them.

Instead, after a few miles they heard a carriage. It belonged to a young English girl who had earlier passed them on the road heading into Delhi and who had refused to listen to their cries of warning. Now, she refused Tytler's request to take on any hitch-hikers.

'I will do no such thing!' was the reply to the request for a lift. 'Do you mean to break down my carriage?'

'Then I won't ask you,' said Tytler, and set to work to put Mrs Gardner, Marie and myself, with our children, inside the carriage.

In this way, we went on until one of the hind wheels of the conveyance rolled off. 'There,' said the young woman (she was only sixteen), 'I knew you would break my carriage. Now what am I to do?'<sup>84</sup>

This time, help came in the form of the recently widowed Mrs Nixon, whose husband the head clerk of the Commissioner's Office, Muhammad Baqar, had seen dead in the street with a biscuit in his mouth. She had made her escape on top of a mail cart, which amid all the chaos had left Delhi punctually at the appointed time as if nothing unusual was happening. The driver had ropes with which they reaffixed the wheels. The Tytlers slowly drove on for a few more miles before the springs of the carriage finally gave out completely and they abandoned their second conveyance on the road as they had done their first. They walked on 'nearly overcome with fatigue in the heat of a May night … our thirst was terrible, with no water to be had except greeny mire from roadside pools that had not yet dried up'.

It was nearly dawn when they commandeered their final vehicle of the day: an arms tumbrel full of broken weaponry on its way to the nowdestroyed Delhi magazine. The two drivers ran away at the sight of Tytler's revolver and the party headed slowly on, arriving at Karnal at ten in the morning.

The Tytlers waited all day for their friends and colleagues to join them. But by that evening, of all the crowd that had left the Flagstaff Tower, only six Delhi refugees had so far made it through.<sup>85</sup>

![](_page_42_Picture_0.jpeg)

The Wagentriebers' journey up the same road made that of the Tytlers, difficult as it was, seem like a picnic. They had left it too late, and the road was now swarming with Gujar tribesmen, intent on plundering refugees and stragglers. 'We may have proceeded a mile,' remembered George,

when my wife pointed out to me a knot of people drawn up on both sides of the road in advance of us. They were evidently up to no good, so I prepared to protect myself and my family. As we approached, they closed in across the road, and I presented my gun at them which had the effect of keeping them off, but they followed the carriage screaming and flourishing clubs and sticks in a very menacing manner.

We left them far behind, only to fall in with a second body; this time more numerous and formidable. As we approached they drew across the road in front of our horses, holding up spears, swords and lathees in a threatening manner, and loudly calling out *thammo*! [stop!] To this I replied by pointing my gun and calling out *hut jao*! [move away!] But one, more daring than the rest, stepped forward and seized the horse's head by the rein, and I seeing nothing for it, fired, the rascal falling behind the carriage. The remainder fell back, my wife whipped up the horses and dashed on, but the ruffians followed very fast, and thinking they were gaining on us I fired a rifle shot, and hit one man, the foremost, in the abdomen. He fell and the others contented themselves with howling and heaping abuse upon the heads of myself and my family for generations.<sup>86</sup>

When they had got a little ahead, Elizabeth stopped the carriage and got the horses' harness in order, while her husband reloaded the weapons. They had not gone far when a third set of Gujars closed in on them, and this time succeeded in clubbing one of the horses on the head. Again, Wagentrieber shot down the leading man, but not before his wife too had been struck a

tremendous blow with an iron-tipped lathi. A second man ran up beside the carriage, sword in hand, and was also shot down; a third succeeded in climbing on to the hood of the carriage and was in the act of striking a potentially fatal blow when he too was shot down by George.

They had not got far ahead of the third group of Gujars before they ran straight into a large party of sepoys. They were returning from training in the Enfield rifle at Ambala, and surrounded the carriage, asking what the family were doing out on such a road at such a time, apparently ignorant of the dramatic events which had taken place. At this point the Gujars caught up, and stood glaring at the Wagentriebers from a distance. Seeing no alternative, and noticing how friendly the soldiers appeared, Elizabeth begged the sepoys for their help, telling them that she was the daughter of James Skinner, Sikandar Sahib, 'and so entitled to the protection of all true soldiers'. This, it turned out, was exactly the right note to have struck:

'You are indeed a great man's daughter,' they said. 'We knew Col Skinner, and it was our regiment which was sent to escort his remains from Rohtak to Delhi.'<sup>87</sup>

In an instant four or five of them stepped forward and standing beside our carriage, levelled their muskets at our enemies, telling them to keep off or they would certainly fire …

After this we were not molested at close quarters, the villains confining their attacks to spears, lathis, and heavy stones thrown at us in showers from behind the parapets of bridges, which most providentially struck none of us. One of our mares sustained severe cuts and bruises, and the carriage bore marks of great ill-usage.<sup>88</sup>

The name of Skinner saved them yet again, when, soon after dawn, the family drew up by a village well, and threw some water over the horses to refresh them. A crowd soon gathered, many of whom appeared to be far from friendly. One, however, turned out to be an old servant of Sikandar Sahib, who had once had an estate in the area. 'He was a respectable old man with a long white beard,' remembered the Wagentriebers' daughter Julia. 'He seemed to know my mother though she had no recollection of him.'

'You are one of Col Skinner's children,' he said, taking off his turban, and laying it at her feet. This mark of respect, coming at such a time, astonished her, especially as she saw that the man seemed to be of some importance by the manner of the others towards him, and the deferential way in which they treated him.

'Who are you?' she enquired.

'I have eaten the Colonel Sahib's salt for many years, and I will give my life for any of his children,' the old man replied. 'Will you trust yourselves to me?'<sup>89</sup>

In due course, the old man took the reins of the carriage and escorted them onwards. At eleven o'clock, they saw another ragged party on the road ahead of them: it was Brigadier Graves and Charles Le Bas, along with several other soldiers, all heavily armed. At 4 p.m., they reached the safety of Panipat.<sup>90</sup>

![](_page_44_Picture_4.jpeg)

The morning of 12 May saw Delhi almost completely emptied of the British, who had dominated it since the British defeated the Marathas in 1803.

As Theo woke in ill-fitting Hindustani clothes, hidden in a back room in the house of a stranger; as the Tytlers in Karnal and the Wagentriebers in Panipat wolfed down their breakfasts; as James Morley, swaying on his bullock cart, pondered life without his wife and family; as Edward Vibart and his party hid in a bunch of tall grass in the fields towards Meerut, avoiding the sepoy search parties out looking for British refugees; as Ghalib peered disapprovingly through his lattices at the sepoys swaggering through his *muhalla* of Ballimaran; as Maulvi Muhammad Baqar began writing up for the *Dihli Urdu Akbhar* all the strange sights and portents that he had seen the day before; as the young Muhammad Husain Azad composed his poem on the Uprising; as Zahir Dehlavi and Hakim Ahsanullah Khan began trying to remove the sepoys from the most crucial ceremonial parts of the

Palace; as all this was happening, Zafar too was anxiously trying to envisage his future.

The night before he had sheltered the forty-odd British prisoners brought in by Muin ud-Din, some of them in one of the few parts of the Palace he could still call his own: his private oratory, the *tasbih khana*. At Zinat Mahal's suggestion, he had also sent off by camel messenger a secret letter to the British Governor at Agra, telling him all that happened and asking for help. Zafar could see that the sepoys were violent and unstable; they also had no idea of manners or courtly etiquette: not the least of his objections to them was their refusal to pay him any of the proper courtesies: 'The Tilangas stood [in the Palace] with their shoes on,' wrote one news-writer, 'and His Majesty expressed his great displeasure about that.'<sup>91</sup>

Yet for all his hesitation and fear and anxieties, for all the chaos of a looted city and harassed courtiers, Zafar could see that the arrival of the mutineers might yet not be entirely a curse, but might in fact represent the hand of God and an opportunity he had never even dreamt of, to reestablish his great Mughal dynasty. Around midnight he sanctioned the firing of a twenty-one-gun salute to mark the beginning of this new phase in his reign. Zafar's ambivalent but increasingly engaged attitude to the revolution was noted by Mohan Lal Kashmiri, a well-connected alumnus of the Delhi College who had allied himself closely with the British cause, as a result of which he had to flee Delhi soon after the Uprising:

I never heard from any native in Delhi or elsewhere that the King Bahadur Shah was in communication with the mutineers before the mutiny broke out. But after the miscreants had made themselves masters of the Palace and the city … they contrived to bring out His Majesty in a royal procession to restore confidence to the citizens. The King saw now for the first time himself surrounded with dashing and disciplined troops, ready to espouse his cause. He saw that the population who came out as spectators of his procession looked upon him not with gloomy faces. He found that the favourable turn of his affairs had been approved by a large portion of the residents. He listened to the news of [British] disasters. He perceived that regiment upon regiment had waited upon him. He received the false reports that all our European troops were engaged in Persia, and that the unsettled state of the European Politics would

hardly permit reinforcements [to be sent] to India. He was informed that the mutiny had [also] taken place in Bombay and in Deccan. All these things made Bahadur Shah believe that he had been born to restore the realm of the Great Timur in the last days of his life.<sup>92</sup>

Zafar's increasing openness to the Uprising, though never entirely wholehearted and always ambivalent, nevertheless changed the whole nature of the rebellion. There had been many mutinies before in British India, most dramatically at Vellore in 1806; there had been even more armed acts of Indian resistance to British expansion. But never before had such a powerful combination of forces come together to challenge British supremacy.

By combining the Company's own Indian armies with the still potent mystique of the Mughals, Zafar's hesitant acceptance of the nominal leadership of the revolt in due course turned it from a simple army mutiny – albeit one supported by an incoherent eruption of murder and looting by Delhi's civilians – into the single most serious armed challenge any Western empire would face, anywhere in the world, in the entire course of the nineteenth century.

Yet for Zafar the more immediate question was whether, for all this, he had merely exchanged one set of masters for another.
