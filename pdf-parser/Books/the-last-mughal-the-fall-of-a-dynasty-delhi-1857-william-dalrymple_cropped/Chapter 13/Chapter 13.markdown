## **11 THE CITY OF THE DEAD**

Hodson's plan for the capture of the King got off to an inauspicious start.

As Maulvi Rajab Ali and Mirza Ilahe Bakhsh approached Humayun's Tomb, they were ambushed by a party of jihadis, and four of their escort of horsemen were badly wounded. They wheeled around and fled back towards Delhi; but coming across Hodson after a short distance they were persuaded to continue with their mission, since the attack 'appeared to be the act of fanatics and not due to the King's party'.<sup>1</sup>

On arrival, Hodson hid in some ruins, out of sight of the gateway of the tomb, and sent in his understandably nervous negotiators, Rajab Ali and Ilahe Bakhsh. They were attended by a small armed escort of fifteen men from Hodson's Horse, led by a Sikh risaldar (cavalry commander) named Sirdar Man Singh. Hodson gave orders that the maulvi was to direct the negotiations. He was instructed to pass straight through the large and unstable rabble of refugees, *shahzadas* (princes), courtiers, hangers-on and jihadis who had taken shelter within the walls of the garden tomb. When he reached Zafar, he was 'to say to the King that if he came out quietly and gave himself up, I [Hodson] would ensure his safety, but if he ventured to

leave the tomb, I had command of the entrance and would shoot him and his attendants without mercy'. For two agonising hours nothing happened. Hodson was just about to assume that his envoys had been murdered when,

after a long delay, the Risaldar came to say that King was coming. Presently Mirza Ilahee Buksh and the Maulvee appeared escorting the King's Palanquin, closely followed by that of the Begum [accompanied by her son Mirza Jawan Bakht and her father Mirza Quli Khan] with their attendants and a host of the fugitives from the palace and city. The Palanquins stopped and a message was sent to me that the King wished to hear from my own lips that his life would be spared.

I rode up to the spot, seizing the opportunity to interpose my men between the King's immediate party and the crowd pressing behind, the appearance of which was threatening. I dismounted for a moment and reassured the King and the Begum (both of whom were evidently much agitated and frightened) by the promise that his life would be spared, provided no attempt was made at a rescue.<sup>2</sup>

In addition to guaranteeing Zafar's life, Hodson promised the King that he would not be subject to 'dishonour *(be-izzat)* or any personal indignity'.<sup>3</sup>

I then remounted and in sufficiently loud tone to be heard by the crowd repeated the words, adding a command to my men to shoot the first person who attempted to move. I then desired Mirza Ilahi Bakhsh and Maulvi Rajab Ali to proceed with the Palanquins as soon as they were a sufficient distance from the crowd.<sup>4</sup>

The journey through the no-man's-land towards Delhi seemed to Hodson to take for ever. As he told a colleague, 'the slow shuffling pace of the [palanquin] bearers, their continual changing of their shoulders, and the pressing on of the crowd,' kept the atmosphere edgy and tense. But the cavalry *sawars* rode close to the King's palanquin, and no attempt at a rescue was made. As the party neared the walls of the city, the crowd of stragglers slowly thinned until by the time they got to the Lahore Gate,

Hodson's *sawars* found they were alone with their captives.<sup>5</sup> The guard at the gate asked who Hodson had within the palanquin, to which he replied, 'only the King of Delhi'. They then passed down Chandni Chowk, and into the Fort, as Zafar returned to his ancestral palace no longer Emperor, but now prisoner.

Everyone stopped what they were doing to stare. One British surgeon described 'an old man with an anxious expression on his thin face' being carried through the litter of his ransacked palace. 'His countenance gave no signs of cruelty,' wrote the surgeon, 'but appeared mild.'<sup>6</sup> Hodson handed his prize over to Charles Saunders, the successor to Hervey Greathed as head of the civil administration of Delhi, and then went to report his coup to General Wilson.

To Hodson's surprise and disappointment, Wilson did not seem especially pleased by the news of the King's capture: 'Well I am glad you have got him,' was all he said. 'I never expected to see either of you again.'<sup>7</sup> According to Fred Maisey, who was also in the room at the time, the old general was actually 'in the most tremendous rage at the king being brought in alive … it seemed to me that the news was far from welcome, which made me doubt all along the assertion [by Hodson] that General Wilson had guaranteed the King's life'.<sup>8</sup> General Wilson later strongly denied that he had ever done so, and there is good reason to believe him, for both the civil and military authorities in Delhi had received strict and specific instructions from Canning in Calcutta not to offer any terms to the Mughals save that of unconditional surrender.

That afternoon, Zafar was taken to Zinat Mahal's haveli in Lal Kuan, where to add to his sufferings he was given the charmless and aggressive Kendal Coghill as a guard: 'I had the satisfaction of receiving the "King of Hindoostan" as a prisoner,' Coghill wrote to his brother the following day, 'and immediately placed him safe with a double sentry over him. It wasn't a manly thing to do, but I couldn't help calling him a pig and other appropriate epithets, and to ask him about our families. I would have shot him dead if he had only looked up, the brute, and gave the sentries orders that if he tried to stir to drop [i.e. shoot] him.'<sup>9</sup>

The following morning Hodson persuaded Wilson to sanction a second expedition to Humayun's Tomb.

This time the object was to pick up Mirzas Mughal, Khizr Sultan and Abu Bakr, the three princes who had commanded the Mughal forces during the Uprising, and whose presence in the tomb had now been confirmed by Mirza Ilahe Bakhsh.\* <sup>10</sup> As before, Wilson made it a condition that he should not be bothered by the prisoners, and as no guarantees of the princes' lives had ever been discussed, Hodson interpreted his General's orders as he wished.

Hodson rode out with an escort of 100 *sawars* at eight in the morning, accompanied as before by his negotiators Maulvi Rajab Ali and Mirza Ilahe Bakhsh. Again, Hodson and his two British deputies halted outside the entrance to the tomb complex, and sent in the two Indians to negotiate. According to Lieutenant MacDowell, who left the only record of what happened, 'We sent in to say that the princes must give themselves up unconditionally, or take the consequences.'

A long half hour elapsed, when a messenger came out to say that the princes wished to know if their lives would be promised if they came out. 'Unconditional surrender' was the answer. Again we waited. It was a most anxious time. We dared not take them by force, all would have been lost, and we doubted their coming. We heard the shouts of the fanatics [jihadis] begging the princes to lead them on against us, and we had only one hundred men and were six miles from Delhi. … There were about three thousand Mussalman followers [in the walled tomb garden]. In a suburb close by [Nizamuddin], about three thousand more, all armed; so it was a ticklish bit of work …

At length imagining that sooner or later they must be taken, the princes resolved to give themselves up unconditionally, fancying, I suppose, that as we had spared the King, we would spare them. So a messenger was sent to say they were coming. We sent ten men to

meet them, and by Hodson's orders, I drew the troops up across the road, ready to receive them and shoot them at once if there was any attempt at a rescue. Soon they appeared, in a small 'Rath' or Hindustanee cart, drawn by bullocks, with five troopers on each side. Behind them thronged about two or three thousand (I am not exaggerating) Mussalmans. We met them and at once Hodson and I rode up, leaving the men a little in the rear. They bowed as we came up, and Hodson, bowing, ordered the driver to move on.

Hodson told the *sawars* to hurry the princes along the road, while MacDowell and his troopers formed up between the crowd and the princes, advancing slowly towards the courtiers and attendants, forcing them back into the garden of the tomb.

Hodson and myself (I stuck to him throughout) with four men, [then] rode up the steps [and] through the arch, when he called out to the rabble to lay down their arms. There was a murmur. He reiterated the command and (God knows why, I can never understand it) they commenced doing so …

What we wanted was to gain time to get the princes away, for we could have done nothing had they attacked us … There we stayed for two hours collecting their arms, and I assure you I thought every moment they would rush on us. I said nothing, but smoked all the time to show I was unconcerned; but at last, when it was all done, and all the arms put in a cart, Hodson turned to me and said, 'We'll go now.' Very slowly we mounted, formed up the troop, and cautiously departed, followed by the crowd. As we got about a mile off, Hodson turned to me and said, 'Well, Mac, we've got them at last'; and we both gave a sigh of relief.<sup>11</sup>

What happened next is disputed. According to Hodson, when they finally caught up with the princes, three miles away, close to the walls of Delhi, and near an archway known ever after as the *Khuni Darwaza*, or Bloody Gate, a large and threatening crowd was closing in on the princes and looked to be on the verge of rescuing them. According to other accounts,

including that of MacDowell, it was only a small crowd and was not in any way threatening. But there is no doubt as to what Hodson did next.

Stopping the cart, he ordered the three princes to get out, and to strip naked. Then taking a Colt revolver, he shot them dead, in cold blood and at point blank range, one after another. He then stripped the corpses of their signet rings and turquoise *bazubands* (armlets), which he pocketed, and seized their bejewelled swords. The following day Hodson wrote to his sister, saying that however exhausted he was from his various exertions, 'I cannot help being pleased with the warm congratulations I received on all sides for my success in destroying the enemies of our race. The whole nation will rejoice.' He added: 'I am not cruel, but I confess I did enjoy the opportunity of ridding the earth of these wretches.'<sup>12</sup>

The bodies were taken away and left out naked in front of the kotwali, where the British troops queued up to see them. 'I saw them there lying stark and stiff,' wrote Fred Maisey, 'and I must say I was glad to see them, for of their guilt there never was a doubt, and I really believe the king was, to a great extent, a puppet in their hands.'<sup>13</sup> Charles Griffiths also applauded Hodson 'for ridding the world of the miscreants', adding that 'he was upheld in the deed by the whole Delhi army, men in every respect better qualified to form a judgement in this particular than the sentimental beings at home'.

I saw them that same afternoon; nor can it be said that I or others who viewed the lifeless remains felt any pity in our hearts for the wretches on whom had fallen a most righteous retribution for their crimes. The eldest [Mirza Mughal] was a strong well-knit man in the prime of life, the next [Khizr Sultan] somewhat younger, while the third [Abu Bakr] was quite a youth of not more than twenty years of age. Each of the Princes had two small bullet-holes over the region of the heart, the flesh singed by gunpowder, as the shots were fired close … The bodies remained for three days, and were then buried in dishonoured graves.<sup>14</sup>

The attitude of Maisey and Griffiths was the norm among the British in Delhi: although there was a whole series of inquiries later launched into

Hodson's conduct, what was examined was not the shooting of the princes, but instead his clemency in presuming to guarantee Zafar's life.\*

![](_page_6_Picture_1.jpeg)

All morning, while Hodson was busy in Humayun's Tomb, curious British soldiers had been going in parties to stare at the captive King, who sat miserably in his wife's haveli, 'like a beast in a cage', according to one officer.† <sup>15</sup> 'I have seen the old Pig of a king,' reported a dismissive Hugh Chichester to his father. 'He is a very old man, just like an old khitmatgar [servant]. One was always supposed to take off one's shoes on going to visit mosques, or to have an interview with the King. But these little affairs we drop now.'<sup>16</sup> Other officers wrote home saying how they had treated the King 'with great disrespect', forcing him to stand up and salaam to them, while one boasted that he had pulled the King's beard.<sup>17</sup>

Among Zafar's visitors on the night of the 22nd was the new Civil Commissioner, Charles Saunders, and his wife Matilda, who went to see the King to break the news that two of his sons and one of his grandsons had been shot dead. Charles Griffiths was part of the guard on duty. 'Sitting cross-legged on a cushion placed on a common native charpoy, in the verandah of a courtyard, was the last representative of the Great Mogul dynasty,' he wrote.

There was nothing imposing about his appearance, save a long white beard which reached to his girdle. About middle height, and upwards of seventy years old, ‡ he was dressed in white, with a conical shaped turban of the same colour and material, while at his back two attendants stood, waving over his head large fans of peacock feathers, the emblem of sovereignty – a pitiable farce in the case of one who was already shorn of his regal attributes, a prisoner in the hands of his enemies. Not a word came from his lips; in silence he sat day and night, with his eyes cast on the ground, and as though utterly oblivious of the condition in which he was placed.

On another bed, three feet away from the King, sat the officer on guard, while two stalwart European sentries, with fixed bayonets, stood on either side. The orders given were that on any attempt at a rescue, the officer was immediately to shoot the King with his own hand.<sup>18</sup>

When the death of the three princes was announced to Zafar, he was so shocked and depressed that he was unable to react. But according to Matilda Saunders, Zinat Mahal was thrilled when she heard the news through the purdah curtain that had been hung 'in the tiny cabin-like rooms' where she had been lodged. 'She said she rejoiced in the death of the elder sons of the King for now her son [Mirza Jawan Bakht] had a chance of succeeding to the throne. Some people might call this honest, however no throne in this world will he find, poor deluded woman, as she will soon discover.'<sup>19</sup>

Matilda Saunders then went and called on Taj Begum, who was being kept in a separate room from her long-time rival.

We went to see another wife once said to have been a great beauty – she is called the Taj Begum. We found her looking very sad with black muslin thrown over head and shoulders. Her mother and brother had both died of cholera since the assault, and she is now no longer the King's favourite. Zinat Mahal became very jealous of her and had her shut in prison for 3 years.

When I was leaving, the King called me back and told me he hoped to see me again, and that he hoped I would act as an ambassador between him and Charlie. I answered 'Kubbeen Nai' which means No Never! Said very emphatically. Twice I repeated it to make sure the old wretch understood me thoroughly. I spoke to the Rifle Guard outside who were guarding him while Charles was assisting Mrs Grant onto the Elephant, and said I hope you will keep the king safely, don't let him run away. 'Oh no Ma'am,' [he replied, ']there's no fear of that, we are a great deal too fond of him!' So I said, 'that's right,' and walked away wishing them Good Morning.<sup>20</sup>

![](_page_8_Picture_0.jpeg)

When, that same evening, a young officer, Henry Ouvry, saw the princes' bodies lying naked at the kotwali, he wrote in his diary that this was just the beginning of the work of retribution for which the British had so long planned: though 'sick of blood', he wrote that he had no doubt that 'we shall have to execute a vast number before we are done'.<sup>21</sup>

Little time was lost before this self-fulfilling prophecy began to be realised. Gallows were erected throughout the gutted city – 'they say there is not a neighbourhood of Delhi without its own place of execution', wrote one Delhiwallah – and the hangings began.<sup>22</sup> The largest was 'right in centre of Chandni Chowk, a hideous erection of wood that was the only new and uninjured structure' in the entire street.<sup>23</sup> On a trip to take the air down the Chowk shortly afterwards, the twenty-three-year-old Lieutenant Edward Ommaney casually noted in his diary that he saw '19 men hanged opposite the Kotwali on one gallow, and 9 on the other'.<sup>24</sup>

Ommaney was disgusted to see that, as in Paris during the Revolution, large numbers had gathered to watch the entertainment provided by the executions. The Chowk, he noted, was 'crowded with officers and Europeans'. 'How transient seems this life,' he wrote in his diary that night, 'when one sees a man so quickly part with it: a few moments and the animated body has separated from that spirit which has gone to appear before its maker, and yet to look at the crowd, how little they feel or seem to understand the awful awful change taking place before their eyes.'<sup>25</sup> He also noted that 'there was a very small drop as the Provost Sergeant said the rope would not stand a long one' – the implication of this being that a short rope meant a slow and more lingering death by throttling; while a long drop would break the neck and bring instant death.<sup>26</sup>

Other observers were gleefully explicit that the short rope was a deliberate strategy to prolong the death of the victim. According to one source, the executioners were bribed by the crowds of British soldiers who were standing around, puffing cigars, making sure that the hangmen kept their victims 'a long time dying … as they liked to see the criminals dance

"a Pandie's hornpipe" as they termed the dying struggles of the wretches'. One provost-marshal alone put to death '400 or 500 wretches' before 'thinking of resigning his office'.<sup>27</sup> Some hangmen even experimented with 'artistic' methods of dispatching their victims 'in figures of eight'.<sup>28</sup>

It was reports of this sort of thing which began to worry Lord Canning in Calcutta. On 25 September he wrote to Queen Victoria about the

violent rancour of a very large proportion of the English Community against every native Indian of every class. There is a rabid and indiscriminate vindictiveness abroad, even amongst many who ought to set a better example, which is impossible to contemplate without something like a feeling of shame for one's fellow countrymen. Not one man in ten seems to think that the hanging and shooting of 40 or 50,000 Mutineers beside other rebels, can be otherwise than practicable and right …<sup>29</sup>

Not all the prisoners in Delhi were hanged; many others were shot. Hugh Chichester wrote that 'There has been nothing but shooting these villains for the last three days, some 3 or 400 were shot yesterday,' noting that while some young boys that the British came across were allowed to pass freely out of the city gates, 'most of them are put to death'.<sup>30</sup> According to Major William Ireland, 'Offenders who were seized were handed over to a military commission to be tried. The work went on with celerity. Death was almost the only punishment, and condemnation almost the only issue of a trial. The gentlemen who had to judge offenders were in no mood for leniency.'<sup>31</sup> It was not just bloodlust and the urge for revenge which provided the motive for this mass slaughter: there was also money to be made. Informers were paid 2 rupees for every arrest, while the captors were allowed to keep 'all money and gold found on the persons of mutineers captured'.<sup>32</sup>

All this was cheered on in the *Delhi Gazette Extra* by George Wagentrieber, who returned from Lahore after the fall of the city to cover the work of retribution to which he had so long looked forward: 'Hanging is, I am happy to say, the order of the day here,' he wrote soon after his return.

Six or eight rebels are hanged every morning and they are being brought in daily from the surrounding villages. A resident of Delhi, in peaceful times, might recognise in them the betinselled equestrians who (dis)graced the Chandnee Chowk, and sported their figures every Sunday evening. But how changed! Their features may be recognised but such a set of miserable crestfallen wretches, were never before beheld in the city of palaces.<sup>33</sup>

Subsequent issues of the paper kept Wagentrieber's readers up to date with the ongoing slaughter: 'Fourteen rebels were strung up opposite the Kotwalee yesterday morning,' observed an approving Wagentrieber a couple of weeks after his return, 'and some more this morning.' This was not nearly enough for Wagentrieber, who attacked Saunders in his columns for his weakness and leniency:

We have one man in Delhi, so full of the milk of human kindness that whilst there is a universal cry for vengeance against the King of Delhi and his whole progeny for their inhuman cruelties and barbarities, his 'bowels yearn' for the innocent son and heir, and in the fullness of his compassion for the little boy of eighteen [Mirza Jawan Bakht] he endeavours to lessen the indignities the little urchin is exposed to … [He] never approaches the royal prisoner without the most profound reverence.

Only Metcalfe, he wrote, was going about the business of retribution and hanging with the 'appropriate energy … under the immediate instruction of Sir Theophilus we have won a good riddance of the *budmashes* [rascals], either by their non-appearance in the city, incarceration or – by the best of all means – the gallows'.<sup>34</sup>

![](_page_10_Picture_4.jpeg)

On Sunday, 27 September, a special thanksgiving service was held by Padre Rotton in the Diwan i-Khas. Rotton preached from the text, 'What shall I

render unto the Lord, for all the benefits which he has done to me?'

As far as Rotton was concerned, the service represented a thanksgiving for deliverance of Good from the hands of Evil: 'It would hardly be possible to conceive anything more impressive than this assembly,' he wrote, 'a small but victorious Christian force assembled within the Imperial Palace of the ancient Moslem capital of Hindustan, lining the four sides of that marble hall wherein the King and his advisers had not long before convened, plotting and determining evil against the British cause.'

And now the councils of evil men had been brought to naught, and every foul purpose of theirs completely frustrated, the triumphant army – the means which God had been pleased to employ in order to bring about these gracious ends – stood devoutly in the Divine presence, ascribing unto Him praise, and saying glory and honour, power and dominion are thine.<sup>35</sup>

One of the few women present, Mrs Coopland, took Rotton's view of events to an even more perverse extreme: 'In this splendid hall,' she wrote, 'which once echoed to the mandates of a despotic Emperor, with sole power of life and death over millions of submissive slaves, now echoed the peaceful prayers of a Christian people.'<sup>36</sup>

Early the following morning, a column of troops moved off towards Agra in belated pursuit of Bakht Khan and his rebel sepoys, though by this stage only 2,600 men of the Delhi Field Force were left to carry on the fight to Agra, and hence to the last great battle of 1857, the relief of the besieged British Residency in Lucknow. Their first trial was simply crossing the deserted city: 'The march was simply awful,' wrote Richard Barter.

Our advance guard consisting of Cavalry and Artillery had burst and squashed the dead bodies which lay swelled to an enormous size in the Chandni Chowk, and the stench was fearful. Men and officers were sick all round and I thought we would never get through the city. It was a ride I don't care ever to take again, and the horse felt it as much as I did, for he snorted and shook as he slid rather than walked over the abominations with which the street was covered.<sup>37</sup>

Fred Roberts was equally horrified. 'The march through Delhi in the early morning light was a gruesome proceeding. On our way to the Lahori Gate by Chandni Chowk, not a sound was to be heard but the falling of our own footsteps; not a living creature was to be seen.'

Dead bodies were strewn about in all directions in every attitude that the death struggle had caused them to assume, in every stage of decomposition. In many instances the positions of the bodies were appallingly life-like. Some lay with their arms uplifted as if beckoning, and indeed the whole scene was weird and terrible beyond description … The atmosphere was unimaginably disgusting, laden as it was with the most noxious and sickening odours.<sup>38</sup>

Though the departing troops were heading back into conflict, and many would lose their lives in the fierce battles that lay ahead in Lucknow, few of the column envied the Prize Agents or the small garrison that was left behind in the stink of this City of the Dead.

One of those who had just received the bad news that he was to stay in Delhi was the young Lieutenant Edward Ommaney. A promising linguist, Ommaney had been part of Nicholson's Moveable Column and had written in his diary of his horror at the latter's brutal treatment not only of the mutineers but even of his unfortunate cook boys. Since then, however, he had himself been scarred and brutalised by the violence he had seen and participated in; and his diary, like Edward Vibart's letters, oscillates between sensitive observation and moments of startling savagery.

Indeed, he was himself aware of the changes that the daily violence were bringing about in the British army of occupation: 'How little the death of anyone affects people,' he wrote in his diary for 1 November, after hearing about the death of John Clifford, whose sister had been murdered with Annie Jennings and whose bloodstained appearance during the capture of

the city had so shocked Charles Griffiths. '[Clifford was] so young and full of spirits when I last saw him a few days ago. I was telling some fellows [about Clifford's death] and all they said was, "Oh, I heard somebody telling so, poor fellow," and that is all. One dies, and only intimate friends mourn – and how few they are.'<sup>39</sup> Yet the same man was capable of writing only a few weeks later, 'coming back, we thrashed every native who did not salaam'.<sup>40</sup>

Two days before the departure of the columns, Ommaney had received orders from Saunders that he was to be Zafar's jailer. His first job had been to find a secure prison for the former monarch within the walls of the Red Fort. He had just found a suitable-looking house at the back of the bazaar – formerly the residence of a junior *shahzada* named Mirza Nili – when he was told that in addition to Zafar and his immediate suite, he would also be in charge of eighty-two women, forty-seven children and two eunuchs of the imperial harem. These had just been brought into the Fort from Humayun's Tomb in a procession of fourteen heavily loaded *gharries* (carts), and placed 'in strict confinement' under Ommaney's charge.<sup>41</sup> The following day, before he had even been able to begin thinking about how he was to feed or organise sanitary arrangements for this many people, cholera broke out among his royal prisoners, claiming the life of the first of the begums the following night.

The new quarters of Zafar and his family were both filthy and basic in the extreme: 'we entered a small, dirty, low room with white-washed walls', wrote Mrs Coopland when she took her turn to come to stare at the prisoner. 'There on a low charpoy cowered a thin, small old man, dressed in a dirty white suit of cotton, and rolled in shabby wraps and *razais* [quilts]. At our entrance he laid aside the hookah he had been smoking and he, who had formerly thought it an insult for anyone to sit in his presence, began salaaming us in the most abject manner, and saying he was "*burra kooshee*" [very glad] to see us.'<sup>42</sup>

'He is confined to a little room containing only one charpoy,' observed another visitor, 'and is allowed but two annas (3d) a day for his food. He is treated with great disrespect by the officers and soldiers, though Mr Saunders is civil to him.'

The Begums and princesses of his house share his prison with him. These unfortunate ladies, to whom no guilt could be attached, were exposed to the gaze of officers and soldiers who could go into the room where they were at their pleasure. To a native woman of the very lowest class this is an unutterable shame. [Whenever any man entered] they all turned their faces to the wall.<sup>43</sup>

Many of Zafar's British visitors actively relished the humiliation they could now inflict on the family simply by breaking the women's purdah: 'It seemed absurd to humour thus their silly prejudices,' wrote Mrs Coopland, 'when they had spared no European in their power any indignity or insult.'<sup>44</sup> In addition, Zafar was forbidden access to his hakim, whom he continually asked for, as well as his dhobi and barber. <sup>45</sup> Even John Lawrence, who in most matters acted as a moderating influence on British excesses at this period, advised Saunders not to be too solicitous to the ex-King: 'Neither the King, nor any member of the family, deserve anything at our hands,' he wrote in December. 'In the present state of feeling it would be a great mistake for us to show him any consideration.'<sup>46</sup>

Whatever injustice this implied, Lawrence was quite correct in his estimation of British public opinion: when Ommaney took Mirza Jawan Bakht out for an elephant ride in Daryaganj, hoping to extract information about the origins of the Uprising from the boy by separating him from his parents, the *Lahore Chronicle* lambasted the Delhi administration for 'keeping the King in luxury' and started a campaign calling for Zafar to be hanged and his city levelled: as if it were not bad enough for 'the King [to be] spared and living in state', harrumphed the *Chronicle* in an editorial,

[now] his youngest son is playing the prince in this city, still reeking with English blood, pounding up and down Chandni Chowk with an English officer behind him. Oh! God that an Englishman should be found base enough to accept the task, and that an English officer should be found playing the part of a lackey to the spawn of the viper!<sup>47</sup>

The campaign to flatten Delhi proved especially popular with the *Chronicle's* readers: 'Having just seen your issue of the 18th instant,' wrote

one reader, 'in which you most properly, as in most of your late issues, uphold the necessity for the destruction of Delhi "in toto" and no sparing of the Jumma Masjid etc for fear of offending the Moslem, I consider it a duty to my country, as it should be of all Englishmen, to assist you in the national cry of "A bloody revenge" and "Down with Delhi".'<sup>48</sup> The campaign also struck a chord among the British troops in Delhi. Hugh Chichester was typical. 'There are several mosques in the city most beautiful to look at,' he wrote to his father. 'But I should like to see them all destroyed. The rascally brutes desecrated our churches and graveyards and I do not think we should have any regard for their stinking religion.'<sup>49</sup> Charles Raikes thought the Jama Masjid should be saved, but converted into a church, 'and name each stone after a Christian martyr'.<sup>50</sup>

Mrs Coopland, not uncharacteristically, was even more outspoken. 'I could not but think it was a disgrace to England', she wrote in her memoirs, 'that this city, instead of being razed to the ground, should be allowed to stand, with its blood-stained walls and streets – an everlasting memorial to the insult offered to England's honour.'

Many would forget this insult; but it cannot, and ought not to be forgotten … If it were destroyed, being their most sacred city, and one that reminds them of their fallen grandeur, it would do more to manifest our abhorrence of their crimes, and our indignation against them, than the hanging of hundreds. Delhi ought to be raized, and on its ruins a church or monument should be erected, inscribed with a list of all the victims of the mutinies – if it be possible to gather all the names of ALL those who were massacred – and the funds for its erection should be raised by a fine levied on every native implicated in the mutinies.<sup>51</sup>

Amid such self-righteous hysteria, only one man dared call publicly for Zafar to be better treated. Henry Layard, the former MP for Aylesbury, came to visit Zafar and was horrified by what he saw. 'Many persons regret that the King of Delhi has not fallen in just punishment for his offence,' Layard told an audience in London. 'I saw the King of Delhi; and I will leave the meeting to judge, when it has heard me, whether he is punished.'

I will not give any opinion as to whether the manner we are treating him is worthy of a great nation. I saw that broken-down old man – not in a room, but in a miserable hole of his palace – lying on a bedstead, with nothing to cover him but a miserable tattered coverlet. As I beheld him, so remembrance of his former greatness seemed to rise in his mind. He rose with difficulty from his couch; showed me his arms which were eaten into by disease and by flies – partly from want of water; and he said, in a lamentable voice, that he had not enough to eat. Is that the way, as Christians, we ought to treat a King? I saw his women too, all huddled up in a corner with their children; and I was told that all was allowed for their support was 16*s* a day! Is that not punishment enough for one that has occupied a throne?<sup>52</sup>

Ommaney, who firmly believed that the British had been too soft on Delhi and should have exacted a more violent retribution, was not readily inclined to ameliorate the conditions of the imprisonment. Yet to his own surprise he slowly came to be fond of Zafar, whom he thought looked 'very like Sir C Napier'. Indeed, he quickly concluded that Zafar was so old, senile and distraught that 'he was perfectly unaccountable for his actions' during the Uprising.<sup>53</sup> Before long the elderly King began to return his jailer's unexpected affection: by mid-October, Ommaney was recording in his diary how Zafar 'appeared as if he was going to embrace me, [but instead] put his right arm on my left shoulder and patted me'.<sup>54</sup>

Ommaney also grew to be increasingly intrigued by Zinat Mahal – who, he said, henpecked her ailing and senile husband; but of the sixteen harem women at his disposal, only she seemed to look after the old man.<sup>55</sup> Zafar, wrote Ommaney in his diary, 'is kept greatly in order by his favourite wife, Zeenut Mehul, who if she is speaking and he puts in a word, tells him to keep quiet as she is speaking. He is always wanting trivial things, which if they do not please him, he throws away, which at times, enrages the Ex-Queen who holds the purse. His own servants and sons treat him with the greatest respect'.\* 56

As for Zinat Mahal herself, he wrote in his diary that 'She talks prettily, but with difficult language for a novice.' Later he added, 'Zeenut Mehul I have never seen, [though] one day I saw her hand and arm which she

showed to let me see part of her clothing at the time she wanted money. She talks nicely, but I believe she is not good looking. She strikes me as being a very clever and intriguing woman.'<sup>57</sup>

Only one member of the family did Ommaney instantly dislike. This was Zinat Mahal's beloved son, Mirza Jawan Bakht. Spoiled and callous, Jawan Bakht soon proved himself more than willing to give evidence about any of his family's activities during the Uprising. Early on in his captivity, Jawan Bakht laughed when he saw Ommaney 'thrash' Zafar's tailor, who had entered the prison without permission. The young prince was warned by Ommaney 'that if he laughed when I punished a man, he would probably get the same'.<sup>58</sup> Within a short time he was offering to show Ommaney the whereabouts of his mother's buried treasure in return for 100 cheroots, which Ommaney procured from the Parsi merchants Cowasjee and Co., who had now moved from the Ridge into the Fort bazaar. <sup>59</sup> 'He [Jawan Bakht] is apt to get very familiar if he fancies he is encouraged,' wrote Ommaney in his diary. 'He possesses in my opinion, not the slightest spark of honor and affection, according to English ideas of those qualities.'

He has told me of many things which implicate his father in the rebellion, he has told of the jewels and property of his mother, who declared she had none, indeed he has as much told me that his mother is a liar. After his showing his brother's treasures, he in fear and trembling went to his father and mother, telling lies as to where he had been. He has no affection for his brothers, calling them *Budmashes*. What more can be required to show the degeneracy of the once proud and powerful race of Taimoor than seeing this young descendant traitor. 60

By the middle of November, news came through from Calcutta that the details of the military commission to try all the princes and nobles of Delhi, including the King, had all been finalised. Shortly afterwards Major J. F. Harriott arrived in Delhi as Deputy Judge Advocate General to begin work on the various trials. Ommaney was instructed to help Harriott with the translations of the documents that had been found in the Palace. These, it was assumed, would provide the evidence for the conviction of the entire Mughal family and their court.<sup>61</sup> It was also hoped that the trial of Zafar,

now seen by many of the British as the central conspirator behind the Uprising, would act as a sort of Commission of Enquiry into the causes of the Uprising.

'Judging from Harriott's appearance and manner,' wrote Ommaney after their first meeting on 27 November, 'none of the prisoners have much chance of getting off.'<sup>62</sup>

However bad the conditions suffered by the royal family, they were preferable to the situation of the ordinary people of Delhi, most of whom were now dotted around the surrounding countryside, sheltering in tombs and ruins, foraging for wild fruits or begging for food as best they could. Only a very few still remained within the city walls, and most of those were starving. According to Charles Griffiths:

The *tai-khanas*, or underground rooms of houses, scattered all over the city, were found to be filled with human beings – those who, by age or infirmity, had been unable to join in the general exodus which had taken place during the last days of the siege. Hundreds of old men, women and children, were found huddled together, halfstarved, in these places, the most wretched looking object I ever saw.

There was no means of feeding them in the city, where their presence would have raised a plague; so by orders of the General, they were turned out of the gates of Delhi. It was a melancholy sight seeing them troop out of the town, hundreds passing through the Lahore Gate … We were told that provision had been collected for their use at a place some miles distant, and it is to be hoped the poor creatures were saved from starvation; but we had our doubts on the subject, and, knowing how callous with regard to human suffering the authorities had become, I fear that many perished from want and exposure.

Within the city, even the most loyal British servants who had opted to stay in their havelis now found their life impossible. Teams of looters, official and unofficial, went from house to house, past the litter of broken furniture and the smashed contents of shops that lay scattered across the streets, seizing what they could, and forcing any inhabitants they found still sheltering in cellars to show them where they had hidden their valuables.<sup>63</sup> 'To all of us [soldiers], the loot of the city was to be a fitting recompense for the toils and privations we had undergone,' wrote Charles Griffiths. 'Nor did the questionable nature of the transaction weigh for one moment with us under the recognized military law – "that a city taken by assault belonged as prize to the conquerors …"

It would have been contrary to human nature, and utterly at variance with the predatory instinct, had the soldiers failed to take advantage of the facilities for plunder which surrounded them on every side; nor could it be expected that a man, after possessing himself of valuables, would … deliver up all his booty to the authorities … Often, when wandering through the city in search of plunder, I, in the company of others, came across officers engaged in the same quest as ourselves …<sup>64</sup>

Meanwhile the prize agents got to work. Mrs Muter described her husband setting off after breakfast

with a troop of coolies, armed with picks, crowbars and measuring lines. A house said to contain treasure would be allotted for a day's proceedings, and the business would commence by a careful survey of the premises … By careful measurement of the roofs above and of the rooms below, any concealed space could be detected. Then the walls were broken through, and if there was a secret room or a built-up niche or recess it would be discovered, and some large prizes rewarded their search. On one occasion … he came back with thirteen wagons loaded with spoil, and among other valuables, eighty thousand rupees – in English money £8000. On another occasion, silver vessels and gold ornaments, and … a bag of a thousand rupees.<sup>65</sup>

'In a very short time,' wrote Charles Griffiths,

the rooms of the Prize Agents were filled with treasures of every kind – jewellery and precious stones, diamonds, rubies, emeralds and pearls without number, from those as large as hen's eggs to the small species used for necklaces; gold ornaments, chains of the most beautiful workmanship, bracelets and bangles all of solid metal … I visited one room, the long table of which literally groaned with riches – a dazzling sight to the eye.<sup>66</sup>

Many spies and collaborators had written evidence that they had assisted the British, but General Wilson had ordered that 'no protection tickets should be recognised as valid unless countersigned by him, and the consequence was that but few obtained anything like protection for their property', stated a report of the Company's Intelligence Department. 'Before two or three days had elapsed there was not a house which had not been ransacked and plundered of its contents, friends and foes of the government suffering to an equal extent.'<sup>67</sup> Munshi Jiwan Lai, who had been a key intelligence official throughout the siege, and only just survived successive rebel attempts to capture and execute him, had his house comprehensively looted by Sikh soldiers on 21 September. <sup>68</sup> A similar fate awaited even the arch-collaborator Mirza Ilahe Bakhsh, who, despite betraying his cousin, Zafar, and even his own grandson, Mirza Abu Bakr, still had his house ransacked and all his goods taken from him by the Prize Agents.<sup>69</sup>

The most poignant letter expressing the feelings of betrayal experienced by all pro-British loyalists was written by the former Delhi College mathematics lecturer and Christian convert, Master Ramchandra. Ramchandra had escaped from Delhi on 11 May, the same day that his fellow convert, Dr Chaman Lal, was killed on the first morning of the Uprising. Returning to Delhi after the fall of the city, he expected to be welcomed home by his fellow Christians, but instead found himself living in fear of his life just as he done during the Uprising – but while before he had been targeted on account of his faith, now he suffered merely because of his skin colour. Finally he decided to put his experiences on record in a letter to Colonel Burn, who had recently been appointed the Military

Governor of Delhi. In the letter he described how he had happily worked as an assistant to the prize agents and as a translator of documents for the trials of the rebels, but even so had found his life constantly threatened. 'More than a month ago', he wrote, 'I was directed to go to Mr Murphy's house near the Church there to translate some papers from Persian into English.'

As I was passing on the road, I saw some English officers standing on Hamid Ali Khan's mosque throwing clay balls by means of a bow or *ghulail* at all native passers-by. All my explanations of being a Govt Servant and a Christian &c could not be of any use; on the contrary they were more exasperated by this; they abused me and threw their clay balls with greater force … [Later, going again] to the said mosque in search of some books which I was employed to collect by the Prize Agent, I was attacked again as before, though I had two Prize Agency Chuprassees [orderlies] with me and though I cried to inform the officers that I had a ticket [i.e. pass] of the Prize Agent.

After that I found to my great grief that I was not only in danger in deserted streets but in my very house also. About 12 days ago, at about 9 o'clock at night, I and two of my friends were conversing with each other … when we were suddenly confounded by the cracking of stones against the doors and walls of my house and one stone falling on my bed with great violence …

Ramchandra described how the English officers billeted opposite his house turned out to be responsible, and that they continued to attack him and his house at regular intervals in the days and nights that followed. One day, returning from Edward Campbell's house in the Fort,

I received a heavy blow on the head from an English officer passing with another gentleman also on horseback and after inflicting this blow with his stick the officer turned around and required me to make a salaam.\* I made many salaams instead of one and cried I was a Christian sir, and employed by the Prize Agency, and after this he proceeded towards the Diwan i-Khas abusing me and saying I was as black as jet. Being much hurt and almost stunned and grieved, I stopped a little at the place where I had received the blow,

seeing which the gentleman who struck me returned towards me galloping and alighting from his horse inflicted many severe blows on my left arm and back …

Ramchandra then described the sufferings he had undergone in the course of the Uprising, on account of his conversion, 'but then I was comforted in my greatest distress by reflecting that what I had gone through was nothing compared with what the English Officers, civil and military, and the missionaries had suffered'.

Besides I thought that if the Mutineers find and kill me they will do so on account of my having abjured the creed of my forefathers and embraced Christianity, and that I will die a witness to the faith of the blessed saviour, like the martyrs of old, the Apostles and early Christians. Herein was a great comfort to me under all my trials and dangers. But there is hardly any comfort remaining, when a native Christian is in danger from Christian officers themselves, merely because he was not born in England and has not a white skin. This was not the case even among the rebels in Delhie who were professors of false religion. A Mohomedan or Hindoo was received as a brother among them. They hated only Christians, and those who were known to be friendly to them.

'This my appeal', wrote the disillusioned Ramchandra, 'is not only for native Christians, for there are very few [left] in Dehlie, but for Hindoos and some Mohomedans also who are allowed to live in the City, but are exposed to danger from the English soldiers, and particularly the English officers.'<sup>70</sup>

Ghalib was among those very few Muslims left in the city. A stroke of luck had protected the poet when so many of his friends and patrons were killed or driven out. For his *muhalla*, Ballimaran, contained the hakim and several

senior courtiers of the loyalist Maharaja of Patiala, who had sent troops and supplies to the British on the Ridge, and who now arranged for guards to make sure that looters did not attack the street. Thanks to the Maharaja's guards, Ghalib was one of the only citizens of Delhi to remain unmolested in his house, and almost the only member of the courtly elite to survive the fall of Delhi with his property, such as it was, intact.

Even so, it was a desperate time. Ghalib wrote in *Dastanbuy* of how he and his neighbours had shut the gate of the *muhalla* and piled stones against it so as to barricade themselves in as all around them 'mass arrests, assassinations and slaughter' imprisoned or killed scores of his friends. Meanwhile, within the barricades, Ghalib's neighbours waited nervously, hoping their meagre stocks of food and water would last until peace returned. In his diary, the poet scribbled down his worries as to how he could survive when his city had been utterly destroyed around him:

There is neither merchant nor buyer; there is no seller of wheat from whom we can buy flour, nor is there a washerman to whom we can give our soiled garments; there is no barber to trim hair, or sweeper to clean our floors. It was impossible for us to leave the lane for water or to get flour. Gradually, whatever provisions we had in our houses were consumed. Although we used the water with great care, not a single drop remained in cup or jar and we were hungry and thirsty throughout the days and nights. Beyond, mass slaughter was rampant, and the streets were filled with horrors … We are like prisoners: nobody comes to visit us and we receive no news. We cannot leave the lane so we are unable to see what is happening with our own eyes. Then one day clouds appeared and it rained. We tied up a sheet in our courtyard and placed our jars beneath it and in this way we collected water … Still the two [adopted] children whom I have raised with such indulgence ask me to give them fruit, milk and sweets, and I cannot satisfy their wishes …<sup>71</sup>

Ghalib's other worry was his mentally ill brother. Unable to reach him, he heard first that his brother's house had been looted. Worse news followed: his brother had run out into the street and been shot dead by trigger-happy British soldiers. To crown this, it was impossible to get out of the city to

bury him, and it was difficult even finding the water to wash the body or a proper shroud in which to lay him to rest. Finally, on 5 October, three weeks after the British entered through Kashmiri Gate, British troops climbed into the *muhalla* and hauled Ghalib off to Colonel Burn to be interrogated. Always a dapper man, Ghalib made sure he was wearing his best Turkishstyle headdress for the interview.

The Colonel looked at this strange fashion and asked in broken Urdu, 'Well? You Muslim?' 'Half,' said Ghalib. 'What does that mean?' asked the Colonel. 'I drink wine,' said Ghalib, 'but I don't eat pork.' The Colonel laughed, and Ghalib then showed him the letter which he had received from the Minister for India *[sic]* in acknowledgement of the ode to Her Majesty the Queen which Ghalib has sent. The Colonel said, 'After the victory of government forces why did you not present yourself at the Ridge?' Ghalib replied, 'My rank required that I should have four palanquin bearers, but all four of them ran away and left me, so I could not come.'<sup>72</sup>

According to Ghalib's own account of the meeting, he also added, 'I am old and crippled and deaf, and as unfit to confer with as I am to fight. I do pray for your success, and have done all along; but I could do that from here.'<sup>73</sup> Colonel Burn let him go.

Almost alone of his class, Ghalib had, without leaving the city, survived the cataclysm that destroyed Delhi. But now he had to face the intense loneliness of the sole survivor – a life without anyone left with whom he could share his tastes or arts or memories. By his own estimate, there were barely a thousand Muslims left in the city; many of his best friends and rivals were dead; while the others were scattered 'in ditches and mud huts' in the surrounding countryside. Meanwhile, he kept his head low in the occupied city, 'a swimmer in this ocean of blood'. As he wrote in a verse contained in a letter to a friend in Rampur:

> Every armed British soldier Can do whatever he wants. Just going from home to market Makes one's heart turn to water.

The Chowk is a slaughter ground And homes are prisons. Every grain of dust in Delhi Thirsts for Muslims' blood. Even if we were together We could only weep over our lives.<sup>74</sup>

'The light has gone out of India,' he wrote in one letter. 'The land is lampless. Lakhs have died and among the survivors hundreds are in jail.'<sup>75</sup> 'People go mad from great sorrow,' he wrote in another. 'Would it be surprising if I should lose my mind from this onslaught of grief?'

What grief haven't I suffered: grief in death, in separation, in loss of income, and in honour? Besides the tragic events in the Red Fort, so many of my Delhi friends have been killed … How can I forget them? How can I ever bring them back … relatives, friends, students, lovers. Now every one of them is gone. It is so terribly difficult to mourn for a single relative or friend. Think of me who has to mourn for so many. My God! So many of my friends and relatives have died that if now I were to die, not a single soul would be left to mourn for me.<sup>76</sup>

Ghalib concluded *Dastanbuy* with a similar cry of despair: 'My sorrows are incurable and my wounds will never heal,' he wrote. 'I feel as if I am already dead.'<sup>77</sup>

![](_page_25_Picture_4.jpeg)

If life was difficult for those who had shown sympathies for the British, it was much more so for those who had rejoiced at their downfall, and who now starved and scavenged outside the city: 'Are the British officers not aware that many innocent and noble minded women, both young and old, with small children are roaming the forests outside Delhi?' wrote Ghalib to

one correspondent, still hoping, contrary to all the evidence around him, that the British had not lost all sense of humanity. 'They have got neither meals to eat nor clothes to wear. They have got neither the place to sleep at night nor a place to take shelter from the burning rays of the sun. One can only weep over the fate of this city.'<sup>78</sup>

Even the implacable George Wagentrieber was shocked by what he saw of the environs of Delhi. Around the town was 'a continuous line of dead carcasses – of camels, horses, and bullocks with their skins dried into parchment over the mouldering bones and still polluting the air around'.

Every tree has either been lopped off or levelled to the ground with our shot. The Garden houses of the Nawabs and other wealthy natives of Delhi present a mass of ruins; most of them are only four walls, full of holes while in front, and indeed all around, lie bleaching remains of man and beast. Close to the road on the left, I saw the perfect skeleton of a human being, the bones all connected and snowy-white, to all appearence uninjured with the exception of a hole in the skull.

Approaching the once dense forest of trees in the subzee mundee [the vegetable market] I was struck with the change six short months had wrought. Instead of the long line of lofty peepul, mango and other trees, the view was clear for miles, the bare trunks alone remaining of what was an impenetrable jungle. Many of these trees, in fact most of them, have been stripped of their foliage to feed the cattle, but there is no mistaking the bruised, ragged appearance of those levelled by round shot … Not a house here has escaped, the walls left standing are very few, and those are well pitted with grape shot and musket balls.<sup>79</sup>

It was amid such ruins that the Delhiwallahs, rich and poor both, struggled to find cover and food to eat. As Ghalib put it, 'the inhabitants of this huge place, seven miles around, are dying daily of starvation and want of shelter'.<sup>80</sup> Miserable sheds had sprung up by the side of the road, inhabited by 'perhaps rich *baniyas*, merchants and shopkeepers', until in November an edict was issued by the British authorities forbidding the construction of such shanties, which they ordered to be torn down immediately, so exposing the refugees to the full force of the elements.<sup>81</sup>

Sickness soon broke out among many of the wasted refugees, especially around Zafar's old summer palace in Mehrauli and the shrine of Nizamuddin.<sup>82</sup> 'Hundreds of the feeble perished through want and misery,' wrote Major Ireland. 'It was not till the end of November that the Hindoo portion of the population was allowed to return. Still no Mahomedan could get in at the gates without a special order. A mark was set upon their houses, and they were required to prove their loyalty before getting back again.'<sup>83</sup>

Sarvar ul-Mulk's aristocratic family still had their servants, but hiding in a tomb and fearful of arrest, they found themselves living the lives of rag pickers. 'Our two servants would go out every day,' he wrote, 'and joining the other looters bring back various eatables such as rice, mutton, jaggery and wheatflour, all mixed together, and these were thrown indiscriminately into a pot which, full of water, was kept balanced on three stones. Then whoever felt hungry would cautiously approach this pot, satisfy himself or herself and that done crawl away under the shelter of the wall and hide.'<sup>84</sup> In his old age, Sarvar ul-Mulk remembered climbing a tamarind tree so as to throw down the fruit to his friends and his terror on seeing a column of khaki-clad troops heading in his direction; he also remembered his relief when they changed course and went elsewhere.<sup>85</sup>

Even worse was the fate of anyone who had been associated with the court, however tangentially, for death was the usual punishment meted out to courtiers if they were caught. Zahir Dehlavi was aware of this and kept moving on as fast as he could to avoid capture. His story was not untypical. After a night in the dargah in Mehrauli he headed on towards Jhajjar with many other refugees – the same road that Theo had travelled in May – and was put up by his cousin, who was the Nawab's prime minister. Here he ate his first proper meal for many days. For a week he stayed there, recovering from his ordeal, but on the eighth night he was woken by his cousin and told that the English soldiers had arrived. They were mass-arresting Delhi refugees, and Zahir was told he had to leave immediately if he wished to save his life.<sup>86</sup>

From Jhajjar, he walked to Panipat, where he was reunited with the rest of his family at the house of his aunt. But again, after a few days, the English surrounded the town on all sides and started conducting house-tohouse searches, looking for mutineers and Mughal nobles and courtiers.

Zahir had a narrow escape, as he happened to be out of the house when the English broke in, but his uncle, brother and brother-in-law were all taken away and hanged.<sup>87</sup> Zahir escaped at night, in the company of Jang Baz Khan, another former attendant at the Fort; avoiding the British dragnet, they managed to cross the Ganges and make it to Bareilly. Here they finally succeeded in catching up with the fleeing rebel army, only for both boys promptly to be arrested as British spies. They were about to be taken away and shot, when Mir Fateh Ali, a Delhi nobleman who had thrown in his lot with the rebels, happened to ride past and recognised them:

He saw me, and jumping off the horse, with his sword cut the ropes with which I and Jang Baz had been fastened, held our hands and took us to that General Sahab [Bakht Khan], and abused and scolded him. He said, 'you traitors, you ruined the house of my King, and ruined Delhi. You destroyed his subjects and rendered them homeless and still you continue with your mischief. These are the servants of the King, and the poor fellows are running away to save their lives from the English, and you are treating them as informers. If I had not come this way you would have killed these innocent men.'<sup>88</sup>

Narrowly escaping arrest by the British a third time in Rampur, Zahir managed to find shelter and a position as poet and courtier in the durbar of the Maharaja of Jaipur. From here he made his way to Hyderabad, where, like Sarvar ul-Mulk, he eventually made a new life in the service of the Nizam.<sup>89</sup>

It was here, in the first years of the twentieth century, that Zahir finally wrote up 'in the language of Zauq, Ghalib and Momin' the notes he had kept of his life in, and escape from, Mughal Delhi: 'My age is past seventy now,' he wrote at the end of his manuscript. 'I have become weak in body and mind, and my memory is beginning to go. I am hard of hearing and can no longer see so well. My heart has been broken by the tragedies I have witnessed.'<sup>90</sup>

Zahir Dehlavi never saw Delhi again. He died in 1911 and was buried in exile in Hyderabad.

![](_page_29_Picture_0.jpeg)

Zahir's life on the run was typical of the fate of most of the *salatin* and courtiers of Zafar's durbar. Few avoided British search parties for long, not least because of the generous bounty put on the heads of everyone associated with the Red Fort.

Throughout October and November search parties were sent out to track down the members of the royal house. The first to be brought in were two of Zafar's younger children, Mirza Bakhtawar Shah, aged eighteen, and Mirza Meandoo, aged seventeen. The two had commanded the Meerut troops and the regiment called the 'Alexander Pultun' respectively. They were promptly tried by Major Harriott and sentenced to death.

'Waterfield came down here to tell the two prisoners that they were to be executed tomorrow,' noted Ommaney in his diary for 12 October.

I was with him. They did not appear to feel it at all, they only wished to see their women and children. I took Meerza Meandoo's two women and a child to see their husband and father for a few minutes … [The following day] they were taken to the ground in a bullock cart, which marched behind the artillery which led the way. On arrival at the place of execution [the sand bank in front of the Palace] the column was drawn in line and prisoners brought out of the cart and blindfolded. 12 riflemen were then ordered to within 12 paces.<sup>91</sup>

The Gurkhas of the firing squad deliberately fired low, however, so as to ensure a slow and painful death, and the officer in charge eventually had to finish the two off with his pistol. 'Nothing could have been more ill favoured and dirty than the wretched victims,' wrote Charles Griffiths, 'but they met their fate in silence and with the most dogged composure.'<sup>92</sup>

Most of Zafar's sons and grandsons met the same end, sooner or later. As Major William Ireland noted, the princes 'had every opportunity of making off. It is surprising, however, how many were caught hovering

about the neighbourhood; [in the end] twenty-nine sons of the royal house were taken and put to death'.<sup>93</sup> So many members of the royal family met dire ends that Ghalib changed the traditional Urdu name for the Palace – the Auspicious Fort – to the Inauspicious Fort.<sup>94</sup>

Only two sons of Zafar are known to have succeeded in making their escape. At the same time as Mirza Bakhtawar Shah and Mirza Meandoo were arrested, two other princes – Mirza Abdulla and Mirza Qwaish – were picked up, still sheltering hopelessly in Humayun's Tomb, and kept under a Sikh guard. According to the Delhi oral tradition recorded by the Urdu writer Arsh Taimuri in the early years of the twentieth century,

The Sikh Risaldar felt pity for these young men, and asked them, 'Why are you standing here?' They replied, 'the sahib has asked us to stand here.' He glared at them and said, 'Have mercy on your lives. When he returns he will kill you; run whichever direction you can. Beware and don't stop even to take a breath.' Saying this, the Risaldar turned his back and both princes ran away in different directions. After some time, Hodson came back and saw that the prisoners had fled. He asked the Risaldar, 'Where did those men go?' 'Who?' the Risaldar asked, as if he was ignorant. Hodson said, 'The princes who were standing here.' He said, 'I don't know. What princes?'

Mirza Qwaish went straight to Nizamuddin to his brother-in-law and told him that he had escaped from the custody of Hodson. His brother said, 'Brother, run away from here.' So he got his head shaved, tied a cloth on the head and wrapped a loin-cloth around his waist; and thus changing his appearance into a fakir, managed to reach Udaipur [in Rajasthan]. There he met one of Maharaja's eunuchs who also came from Delhi. The eunuch appealed to the Maharaja that a dervish had come, and if some salary is fixed for him then he would stay and keep praying for your life and wealth. The Maharaja granted the wish and fixed for him two rupees per day. After the mutiny he lived for 32 years. He spent his entire life in Udaipur, and was popularly known as Mian Sahib.

Hodson continued his search for Mirza Qwaish and searched every nook and corner, but could not find him. The government even released a poster for his arrest and announced a huge reward.

Allured by this, several people went to Udaipur, and with the help of the Kotwal of the city reached the house where Mirza Qwaish was living in disguise, but he never fell into their hands, and died a free man in Udaipur.

Mirza Abdullah meanwhile lived in the princely state of Tonk in extremely difficult conditions, roamed about as a tattered beggar in a pathetic condition and finally died in the same state.<sup>95</sup>

Once they were arrested there was no clear policy on what should happen to the various princes. Those who could be shown to have been in any way implicated in the Uprising were immediately hanged, but that still left large numbers of princes who were not obviously guilty of any crime other than that of belonging by birth to the Mughal dynasty. The records of the British administration in Delhi at this period, preserved intact in the Delhi Commissioner's Office archive, show the arbitrary and astonishingly chaotic nature of the British response to this problem.<sup>96</sup> Some of these princes were hanged, others transported to the new imperial gulag set up on the hot and impossibly humid Andaman Islands, some sent into internal exile. Most were imprisoned in Agra, Kanpur or Allahabad, where large numbers died within two years owing to the harsh conditions of their imprisonment. These included 'a cripple, a boy of 12 years of age, and a very old man'.

A review of some of these cases was held by Saunders in April 1859 on orders from John Lawrence. The Delhi Commissioner had to admit that for almost all of the imprisoned princes and *salatin* 'the enquiries I have made have not resulted in bringing blame to any of the above parties', and it was impossible in most cases 'to prove any overt act of rebellion'.

None of the prisoners have been proved guilty of any more serious offence than that of being members of the ex-King's family. In the eyes of many this would be considered sufficient to warrant them severe punishment for it is notorious that the whole of the House of Taimur were (as might very naturally have been expected) elated with the prospect of their dynasty being once more in the ascendant and so took a very zealous and active part in the hostilities and dreadful scenes which were enacted in the palace.

The retribution which has fallen upon the members of the house has however been severe, and the mortality among the prisoners whose cases have come before the commission it will be seen has been very great [annexed was a list of fifteen princes who had died in prison in the previous eighteen months]. I therefore beg to recommend that the surviving prisoners be removed to a distance from Delhi to Rangoon where they are not likely to acquire any local influence, or Benares which is a Hindu city, or Multan if it be considered necessary that they should remain under the charge of the Punjab government.<sup>97</sup>

It was at this point that the full chaos of the penal regime became apparent, as it strained to cope with the vast number of captives imprisoned after the Uprising. Successive prisons sent letters to Saunders denying having any of the prisoners they were on record as having received; prisoners exiled to Burma turned out to have been sent instead to the Andamans or to Karachi; and the death toll in only two years turned out to be much higher even than previously realised. One unfortunate group of *salatin* thought to be imprisoned in Agra, and then sought for in Kanpur, were eventually found to have been in Allahabad Jail, but recently had moved to Calcutta for forwarding to the Andamans; they were on the point of embarking there when they were sent instead into exile in Karachi at the other end of India. In the end, the survivors – including several who had not been arrested and were living peaceably in Delhi – were divided between a small number who were sent to Karachi, and the great majority of the male *salatin* who were exiled to Moulmein in Burma.

None was allowed to settle in Delhi, even if they could establish their complete innocence, though five of the Karachi princes later 'absconded' and were believed to have made it back to the Mughal capital incognito.<sup>98</sup>

It was not just the royal family which the British were intent on arresting and bringing to trial. Most of the local landowners had sat on the fence throughout the Uprising, and while attempting to placate both sides, had supported neither. Nevertheless, neutrality was taken by the British to mean guilt, and one by one, the nawabs and rajas of Zafar's court were brought in, imprisoned, tried and hanged.

Ghalib's friend Nawab Muzaffar ud-Daula was arrested in Alwar with two other leading Delhi noblemen and hanged near Gurgaon 'as the collector of the district said there was no reason to send them back to Delhi and so executed them there'.<sup>99</sup> The Shia leader Nawab Hamid Ali Khan, who had left Delhi with Zahir Dehalvi's family, was hunted down near Karnal. Hakim Mohammad Abdul Haq, the agent of the Raja of Ballabgarh, and Nawab Mohammad Khan, Mirza Khizr Sultan's *mukhtar*, who had commanded a wing of the rebel army at the two battles of the Hindun Bridge and at Badli ki Serai, were arrested together 'in the territory of the Nawab of Jhajjar', and after being brought back to Delhi for trial 'suffered the extreme penalty of the law' on 25 November. <sup>100</sup> The Farrukhnagar Nawab was brought in from his palace and turned out to be an opium addict, so that he suffered terrible withdrawal symptoms when his supply was peremptorily stopped under Ommaney's no-nonsense prison regime. He was later hanged.<sup>101</sup>

Theo Metcalfe went personally to arrest the Nawab of Jhajjar, who had refused him shelter on the first week of the Uprising. Ommaney was particularly impressed by the Jhajjar Nawab's bearing and bravery, describing him as 'a fine looking man, stout and rather handsome'.<sup>102</sup> He was also moved when news came through of his death sentence: 'the two young sons of the Jhujjur Nawab on seeing their father, the little fellows cried very much, a striking and still a painful scene … I felt pity for the Nawab; he was a fine looking man and bore his sentence and death very well. His servants made low salaams when he left for execution'.<sup>103</sup>

Ommaney was not alone in being moved by the hanging of all these noblemen. Another witness, Mrs Muter, was particularly impressed by the 'startling justice' and logic of the Jhajjar Nawab's defence in court, arguing that 'it was England who had armed and trained the ruffians who had brought the calamity on the land; and it was not fair to expect him to

compel that obedience in his followers which the rulers of the country and his judges had failed in compelling among their own'.

The Prince met his fate on the gallows with a calmness, fortitude, and gentlemanly bearing that inspired my husband, who commanded the escort, with the greatest respect. More melancholy still was the death of the Rajah [of Ballabgarh], whose sympathies as a Hindoo were probably as much with the English as with the Moslem Emperor. Gentle in manner, and young and handsome in person, it was a hard fate of this noble to be placed in circumstances wherein every path was fraught with peril and to be tried when death was the award of any act hostile to our rule. There was something touching in the last words he spoke before his judges: 'I was securely seated on a goodly bough of a flourishing tree, and my own act has sawn asunder the branch on which I rested'.<sup>104</sup>

Theo Metcalfe soon proved himself one of the most enthusiastic bounty hunters and hangmen. His desire for revenge seems to have continually grown ever since he reached the British camp at the end of his wanderings; and by October he even went so far as to erect a gallows in Metcalfe House. There he strung up from the charred beams any Indian he took to be an offender – an explicit statement of retribution for the destruction of his family's seat and the betrayals he believed he had personally suffered. One case recorded in the *Delhi Gazetteer* concerned a village that had given up one of Theo's servants to the rebels. In retaliation, Theo is said to have summarily shot twenty-one of the leading villagers.<sup>105</sup>

From his new home in Zinat Mahal's magnificent Lal Kuan haveli, Theo terrorised the region around Delhi, swooping down on groups of refugees sheltering in tombs and in shrines, and hanging any men he fancied had been involved in the Uprising.<sup>106</sup> According to a letter published in *The Times* in January 1858, Metcalfe was 'every day trying and hanging all he

can catch … he is held in great dread by the natives'. 'Metcalfe went on a shooting spree,' noted Zahir Dehlavi. 'Whenever he spotted a young man he would shoot him there and then with his pistol, without any reason or questioning of right and wrong.'<sup>107</sup>

Indeed, so frightening was Theo's reputation that he soon became a sort of Delhi bogeyman whose name alone was enough to cause terror. According to the formidable Mrs Coopland,

When I was in Delhi he was busy hunting out, trying and hanging mutineers and murderers: he had a lynx eye for detecting culprits. One day, when passing General Penny's house, amongst a guard of sawars, he detected a murderer, and instantly singled him out, tried and condemned him; he also found out poor Mr Fraser's murderer, and had him hanged. One day a native jeweller came to offer his wares to Mrs Garstin who thinking he charged too much, said 'I will send you to Metcalfe Sahib;' whereupon the man bolted in such a hurry that he left his treasures behind and never again showed his face.<sup>108</sup>

This was a period when daily hangings and murders were the norm rather than the exception, and were looked upon by the British with something approaching boredom. So while the details remain hazy, the fact that Theo was singled out for his readiness to shoot and hang implies that he was believed responsible for a quite exceptional number of arbitrary killings. Rumours of his excesses even began to reach Sir John Lawrence in Lahore, who quickly became concerned at the reports that 'civil officers [are] hanging at their own will and pleasure'. Before long Lawrence began to make enquiries as to whether Theo needed reining in, or even to be suspended from the service. 'If what I have heard is at all true,' wrote Lawrence to Saunders, 'it is our duty to interfere and not allow Metcalfe the power of life and death. [My informants] seemed to feel strongly that his fervor is opposed to the just deliberation required in a Special Commisioner, and that the sooner the direct power of death is taken from him the better for the interests both of the people and of our administration.'<sup>109</sup>

The more Lawrence heard, the more anxious he became: 'He [Theo] has good soldierly qualities,' Lawrence wrote to Saunders, 'and distinguished himself at the storm of Delhi. But he is wrong-headed and injudicious, and just now more particularly so, owing to the exasperations he feels against the Mussalmen. It is very difficult to manage him … Metcalfe's parents were among my oldest and best friends. Personally I would be glad to help him; but there are higher considerations than even these.'<sup>110</sup>

Edward Campell's job as Prize Agent meant he was also involved in the work of vengeance, but he showed much less enthusiasm for the task than his increasingly violent and bloodthirsty brother-in-law. He wrote regularly to GG from his various excavations: 'I am digging for treasure in the city,' he scribbled on one occasion, 'and have found an old blank book, out of which I am taking a leaf to write to you, and have sent to see if I can get some ink from a Bunneah [moneylender]. I have got some little things for you from the prize, only trifles, but I think you will like them, and I will send them up the first opportunity. 111

Being a Prize Agent was a highly paid and potentially very lucrative post, but it was not something that appealed to Campbell: 'It is very dirty work frightening Bunneahs into disclosing where they stowed away their wealth,' he wrote to GG that week.

You know, dearest, how I never have anything to do with torture. Wriford is the great one for extracting their wealth. I am assured I don't look cruel and severe enough – but the fact is you cannot go long on the same beat. The people hear what is going on and make their escape and unless you have one [person for every] ten houses to show you where their money is secured, you might dig for ever. But it is very sickening work,\* my own wife, and I have given you enough of it.<sup>112</sup>

He added, 'We have found one of the old carved chairs [from Metcalfe House]. I am afraid poor Theo thinks he is entitled to these, and he will be awfully disquieted when he finds that he will have to buy them as of course [along with everything else found in Delhi], they are reckoned as prize property. This is no pleasure for me as one of the prize agents.' He then wrote something that he hoped GG would not take amiss: 'I fear Theo is not

taking the part he might, but is using his knowledge of the city to his own profit, and I cannot tell you how painful it is for me.'

What he seems to have meant, as later charges would make more explicit, was that Theo was suspected of hanging prominent Delhiwallahs if they refused to hand their fortunes over to him. There were also rumours that he was performing private looting operations and accepting protection money from bankers who wished to retain their property and were prepared to buy themselves immunity. Theo was certainly desperate enough to act in this way. He had lost everything in the outbreak – his house, his inheritance and his money, which had been invested in the Delhi Bank. Moreover, as a civilian official, he had no claims on the prize money, which was supposed only to go to the army.

This at least, Edward Campbell acknowledged, was unjust: 'I say he ought to have his share of the prize money as a military man as he was made to act like a soldier in leading one of the parties after Delhi up to the Jumma Musjid, and I hope to get this arranged. Otherwise we, as Prize Agents, must interfere with him.'

Edward concluded: 'I get so tempted to give up this Prize Agency, GG, but it may turn out a good thing and it would be wrong for me to sacrifice so much money on so short a trial … I hope they will bring us home [to England] soon, for we are such a small body now that it would take ever so long recruiting up to our former strength. Our killed and wounded since the 30th June [when Campbell arrived in Delhi] is around 400, nearly half the regiment.<sup>113</sup>

By the end of January 1858, when all the noblemen of his durbar had been tried and hanged, it was the turn of Zafar himself to face trial.

Throughout the autumn and the early part of the winter of 1857, while the battle for Lucknow still raged in the eastern half of Hindustan, much of the effort of British administration in Delhi went into preparing for the historic trial of the man who was now clearly going to be the last of the

Mughals. Translators were sent down from Lahore to help plough through the great stash of paperwork that had been retrieved from both the Palace chancellery and the rebels' camp; the legality and binding nature of the guarantee of his life that Hodson had given Zafar was examined in great detail; and the nature of the Emperor's trial, and the charges that would be brought, were discussed. In the end it was agreed that the guarantee was legally binding, although it had been given contrary to the repeated written instructions of Lord Canning; and it was settled that Zafar would be charged with 'rebellion, treason and murder' and 'not regarding his allegiance' as a British subject by a Military Commission. This would sit to hear the charges at the end of January 1858. Major Harriott, who had successfully prosecuted and hanged most of Zafar's court and family, was now to prosecute the man he made clear he regarded as 'the leading chief of the rebels'.

What was never discussed was whether the Company was legally empowered to try Zafar at all. For though the government took the position that Zafar received a pension from the Company, and was therefore the Company's pensioner and thus subject, the actual legal position was considerably more ambiguous. While the Company's 1599 charter to trade in the East derived from Parliament and the Crown, its authority to govern in India actually legally flowed from the person of the Mughal Emperor, who had officially taken on the Company as his tax collector in Bengal in the years following the battle of Plassey, on 2 August 1765.

As recently as 1832, when Zafar was fully fifty-eight years old, the Company had acknowledged itself to be the Mughal Emperor's vassal on its coins and even on its great seal, which was covered with the inscription 'Fidvi Shah Alam' (Shah Alam's devoted dependant); this was removed only under the influence of Sir Charles Metcalfe in 1833. Since then, nothing had happened to change the legal relationship of the two parties, for although the Company had unilaterally ceased to offer *nazrs* and no longer proclaimed its vassalage on its coins or seal, neither Shah Alam, nor Akbar Shah, nor Zafar himself had ever renounced their sovereignty over the Company. From this point of view, Zafar could certainly be tried as a defeated enemy king; but he had never been a subject, and so could not possibly be called a rebel guilty of treason. Instead, from a legal point of view, a good case could be made that it was the East India Company which

was the real rebel, guilty of revolt against a feudal superior to whom it had sworn allegiance for nearly a century. 114

The absurdity of the Company's charge against Zafar was wonderfully articulated by the *Times* correspondent William Howard Russell – the father of war journalism – who arrived in the ruins of Delhi around this time. Skeletons still littered the streets, and the domes and minars of the city were riddled with shell holes; but the walls of the Red Fort still looked magnificent: 'I have seldom seen a nobler mural aspect,' wrote Russell in his Indian memoirs, 'and the great space of bright red walls put me in mind of the finest part of Windsor Castle.' Russell was also very taken with the comforts of Ludlow Castle, Simon Fraser's old residence, which Saunders, the Civil Commissioner, had recently had repaired and refurbished. 'The gharry drove up under the pillared portico,' wrote Russell. 'In a moment out came a ruddy, comely English gentleman, and before I knew where I was, I was ushered into the presence of a fair Englishwoman, who sat at a well furnished board, doing the honours of her table to a circle of guests.'

I had not seen the face of an Englishwoman since I left Calcutta. I came in dusty – I am afraid, dirty – a hot unpleasant-looking stranger. I found myself at once back in civilized life, amid luxuries long unknown. The comfort and luxury of the house itself were a positive gratification of the senses. Large lofty rooms – soft carpets, sofas, easy chairs, books, pictures, rest and repose, within. Outside, kuskus-tatties\* and punkah-wallahs. The family were at their first breakfast when we went in. I found there were two breakfasts, one at 8, the other at 3 o'clock.

Russell's ultimate destination was, however, rather less welcoming. Along 'a dark dingy back passage' of the Red Fort, he was later led to the cell of the man whom he had been told now stood accused of being the mastermind of the Uprising: 'That dim, wandering eyed, dreamy old man with a feeble hanging nether lip and toothless gums – was he, indeed, one who had conceived that vast plan of restoring a great empire, who had fomented the most gigantic mutiny in the history of the world, and who from the walls of his ancient palace had hurled defiance and shot ridicule upon the race that held every throne in India in the hollow of their palms?' asked a surprised Russell. Zafar was being sick when Russell walked in, his

'bent body nearly prostrate over a brass basin, into which he was retching violently …'

Crouched on his haunches [was] a diminutive, attenuated old man, dressed in an ordinary and rather dirty muslin tunic, his small lean feet bare, his head covered by a small thin cambric skull-cap … Not a word came from his lips; in silence he sat day and night with his eyes cast on the ground, and as though utterly oblivious of the conditions in which he was placed … His eyes had the dull, filmy look of very old age … which seems as if it were to guide us to the great darkness … Some heard him quoting verses of his own composition, writing poetry on a wall with a burned stick …<sup>115</sup>

Aware of his history, and stirred by the ruined magnificence of the Mughal's great palace, Russell was properly sceptical about the legality of the Company's charges against Zafar.

Here is the place from which came the haughty *ukases* [decrees] that gave to a few trembling traders the right to hold lands in India on the tenure of service and submission … Even in the extreme of his decrepitude, the descendant of Akbar had fenced himself round with such remnants of dignities that the Governor General of India could not approach him as an equal, and the British officers at Delhi were obliged to observe in their intercourse with him all the outward marks of respect which a sovereign had the right to demand from his servants …

[The King] was called ungrateful for rising against his benefactors. He was no doubt a weak and cruel old man; but to talk of ingratitude on the part of one who saw that all the dominions of his ancestors had been gradually taken from him until he was left with an empty title, and more empty exchequer, and a palace full of penniless princesses, is perfectly preposterous. Was he to be grateful to the Company for the condition he found himself?

We, it is true, have now the same right and the same charter for our dominions that the Mahomedan founders of the house of Delhi had for the sovereignty they claimed over Hindustan [i.e. the right of conquest] but we did not come into India, as they did, at the head

of great armies, with the avowed intention of subjugating the country. We crept in as humble barterers, whose existence depended on the bounty and favour of the lieutenants of the kings of Delhi; and the 'generosity' we have shown was but a small acknowledgement of the favours his ancestors had conferred to our race.<sup>116</sup>

Russell concluded by pointing out that if the King was to be tried by a proper court of law, rather than by a Military Commission, the charges against Zafar would be almost impossible to prove: 'An English lawyer in an English court of justice might show that it would be very difficult for our Government to draw an indictment against the King of Delhi for treason, for the levying of war against us as lords paramount …'

Russell also wrote that he believed that Zafar could hardly be blamed for wanting to throw off his bondage. 'I could not help thinking, as I looked at the old man,' he wrote, 'that our rulers were somewhat to blame for the crimes he had committed …'

To my mind, the position of the King was one of the most intolerable misery long ere the revolt broke out. His palace was in reality a house of bondage; he knew that the few wretched prerogatives which were left to him, as if in mockery of the departed power they represented, would be taken away from his successors; that they would be deprived of even the right to live in their own palace, and would be exiled to some place outside the walls. We denied permission for his royal relatives to enter our service; we condemned them to a degrading existence, in poverty and debt, inside the purlieus of their palace, and then we reproached them with their laziness, meanness, and sensuality. We shut the gates of military preferment upon them – we took from them every object of honourable ambition – and then our papers and our mess rooms teemed with invective against the lazy, slothful and sensuous princes.

Better die a thousand deaths than drag on such a contemptible, degrading existence. Had the old man and his sons refrained from

shedding innocent blood – had they died with harness on their backs – I for one should have felt sympathy for their fate.<sup>117</sup>

![](_page_42_Picture_1.jpeg)

Zafar was still very ill on the day finally set for his trial, 27 January 1858. It dawned a cold, wet and cloudy winter's day and Edward Ommaney confided in his diary that he was glad of the fire in his bedroom.<sup>118</sup> 'The old man appears very much broken this morning,' Ommaney reported to Saunders. '[He is] very weak, can scarcely speak. I do not think he can go on much longer this way. <sup>119</sup> Since Zafar could not walk, Ommaney had to help him out of his palanquin; he was supported on one side by Mirza Jawan Bakht, and on the other by a servant. They led him into the Diwan i-Khas, his old hall of private audience, where he was now to be tried for treason by those he had reason still to regard as his vassals.

To remind him of his subject state, Zafar was not allowed either his fly whisk or his hookah. Among the spectators already in their seats were both Charles and Matilda Saunders, and Edward Vibart, as well as George Wagentrieber, representing the *Delhi Gazette*, and Harriet Tytler, who had been given rooms in the Fort after her husband Robert moved his regimental treasure chest within its walls on the evening of its capture.<sup>120</sup>

The trial got off to a suitably chaotic start. Although the proceedings were to be held partly in Hindustani, none of the five judges – all army officers of relatively junior rank – proved to be fluent in that tongue. Edward Vibart wrote that the 'President alone was familiar with the Hindoostani language'.<sup>121</sup> Although proceedings were scheduled to begin at 11 a.m., the president of the court martial, Brigadier Showers, failed to turn up until noon, and then appeared only briefly to announce that he had been ordered to Agra to take command there. All this time, Zafar was left waiting outside 'under a strong guard of the rifles'.<sup>122</sup>

When proceedings finally got going later in the afternoon, under the presidency of Colonel Dawes, the charges were read out, and Zafar – now parked on a bed of cushions between Dawes and the prosecutor, Major

Harriott – was asked whether he pleaded guilty or not. But it soon became clear that the old man could not understand what was going on, and there was a further 'considerable delay' before he could be persuaded to plead not guilty.

Over the days that followed, an impressive body of evidence was presented. Witnesses were called to give eyewitness accounts of the outbreak and the principal events of the Uprising, while the key passages from the manuscripts seized from the Palace chancellery, the office of Mirza Mughal, the kotwal and the army camp were read out in full. 'Each paper, as it was read, was shown to the prisoner's vakil [Zafar's lawyer, Ghulam Abbas] and identified by him,' wrote one witness, Charles Ball, 'although the King himself professed utter ignorance of the existence of such documents – denied his signature, and endeavoured, by gestures of dissent, to impress the court with the idea of his entire innocence.' Soon, however, Zafar's attention began to wander: 'The royal prisoner appeared to consider the proceedings perfectly unimportant, and merely tiresome,' wrote Ball, 'and he found relief from *ennui* by dozing …'

Occasionally, however, when some particular passage was read, the dull eyes would light up, and the bowed head would be raised in marked attention for a few moments – only to relapse into a state of listless indifference … His son appeared more animated, and laughed and chatted with his father's attendant without appearing at all embarrassed.<sup>123</sup>

Before long, Mirza Jawan Bakht, who was deemed by Ommaney to be looking 'very impertinent, indecorous and disrespectful', was banned by his jailer from attending further sessions.<sup>124</sup> Without his beloved young son to keep him company, Zafar showed less and less interest in the proceedings. Often he was too unwell to appear at all, and the court was frequently adjourned on the grounds of the prisoner's ill health. When the court did sit, according to Ball,

The King displayed a singular line of conduct, not at all in keeping with the serious position he occupied. Occasionally, while the evidence was progressing, he would coil himself up in his shawls, and reclining upon the cushions placed for his convenience, would

appear perfectly indifferent to the proceedings around him; at other times he would suddenly rouse up, as if from a dream, and loudly deny some statement of a witness under examination; then again relapsing into a state of real or assumed insensibility, he would carelessly ask a question, or laughingly offer an explanation of some phrase used in evidence.

Upon one occasion, he affected such utter ignorance of a question before the court, in reference to his alleged intrigues with Persia, as to inquire 'whether the Persians and the Russians were the same people.' He several times declared himself perfectly innocent of everything he was charged with, and varied the weariness of his constrained attendance by amusing himself with a scarf, which he would twist and untwist around his head like a playful child.<sup>125</sup>

In response to the various charges, Zafar offered only a single, short but strikingly coherent written defence in Urdu, denying that he had any connection with the Uprising and maintaining that he had all along been the helpless prisoner of the sepoys. 'I had no intelligence on the subject previous to the day of the outbreak,' read Zafar's statement.

I begged them to go away … I swear by God, who is my witness, that I did not give orders for the death of Mr Fraser or of any other European … As regards the orders given under my seal, and under my signature, the real state of the case is that from the day the soldiery came and killed the European officers and made me a prisoner, I remained in their power. All the papers they thought fit, they caused to be prepared, and bringing them to me, compelled me to fix my seal … Frequently they had the seal impressed on the outside of empty unaddressed envelopes. There is no knowing what papers they sent in these or to whom they sent them.

They used to accuse my servants of sending letters to and keeping in league with the English … They even declared they would depose me and make Mirza Mughal king. It is a matter for patient and just consideration then, what power did I in any way possess? The officers of the army went even so far as to require that I should make over the Queen Zinat Mahal to them, that they might

keep her a prisoner, saying she maintained friendly relations with the English …

All that has been done was done by that rebellious army. I was in their power, what could I do? I was helpless, and constrained by my fears, I did whatever they required, otherwise they would have immediately killed me. This is universally known. I found myself in such a predicament that I was weary of my life. In this state of things I resolved to accept poverty, and adopted the garb, coloured with red earth, of the religious mendicant, intending to go first to the shrine of Qutb Sahib, thence to Ajmer, and from Ajmer eventually to Mecca.

If I had been in league with them, how would these things have occurred? As regards the behaviour of that rebellious army, it may be stated that they never saluted me even, nor showed me any other mark of respect. They used to walk into the hall of special audience and the hall of devotion with their shoes on … What confidence could I place in troops who had murdered their own masters? In the same way that they murdered them, so they made me a prisoner, and tyrannised over me, keeping me on in order to make use of my name as a sanction for their acts. Seeing that these troops killed their own masters, men of high authority and power, how was I without an army, without treasure, to have resisted them …? God knows, and is my witness, that I have written only what is strictly true.<sup>126</sup>

It was just as well for the prosecution that Zafar did not attempt to mount a more serious and concerted legal defence, or choose to cross-examine any of the witnesses. For as the trial wore on, despite the density of witnesses and evidence produced, the absurdity of the principal thrust of the prosecution case became more and more apparent. Quite apart from the higher question of whether the court had the authority to try Zafar, Major Harriott, the prosecutor, chose to build a highly speculative case of such obvious flimsiness and lack of understanding of what the Uprising had been about that none of the British observers who kept accounts of the trial could be persuaded even to begin to believe his argument.

Harriott maintained that Zafar was the evil genius and linchpin behind an international Muslim conspiracy stretching from Constantinople, Mecca and Iran to the walls of the Red Fort. His intent, declared Harriott, was to subvert the British Empire and put the Mughals in its place. Contrary to all the evidence that the Uprising broke out first among the overwhelmingly Hindu sepoys, and that it was high-caste Hindu sepoys who all along formed the bulk of the fighting force; and ignoring all the evident distinctions between the sepoys, the jihadis, the Shia Muslims of Persia and the Sunni court of Delhi, Major Harriott argued that the Mutiny was the product of the convergence of all these conspiring forces around the fanatical Islamic dynastic ambitions of Zafar: 'To Musalman intrigues and Mahommedan conspiracy we may mainly attribute the dreadful calamities of the year 1857,' argued Major Harriott. 'The Mutineers [were] in immediate connexion with the prisoner at your bar.'

The conspiracy, from the very commencement, was not confined to the sepoys, and did not even originate with them, but had its ramifications throughout the palace and city … [Zafar was the] leading chief of the rebels in Delhi … Dead to every feeling that falls honourably on the heart of man, this shrivelled impersonation of malignity must have formed no inapt centrepiece to the group of ruffians that surrounded him … We see how early and how deeply the [Muslim] priesthood interested and engaged themselves in this matter, and how completely and exclusively Mahommedan in character was this conspiracy …

[Was Zafar] the original mover, the head and front of the undertaking, or but the consenting tool … the forward, unscrupulous, but still pliant puppet, tutored by priestly craft for the advancement of religious bigotry? Many persons, I believe, will incline to the latter. The known restless spirit of Mahommedan fanaticism has been the first aggressor, the vindictive intolerance of that peculiar faith has been struggling for mastery, seditious conspiracy has been its means, the prisoner its active accomplice, and every possible crime the frightful result … The bitter zeal of Mahommedanism meets us everywhere … perfectly demonic in its actions …<sup>127</sup>

The Uprising in fact showed every sign of being initiated by uppercaste Hindu sepoys reacting against specifically military grievances perceived as a threat to their faith and dharma; it then spread rapidly through the country, attracting a fractured and diffuse collection of other groups alienated by aggressively insensitive and brutal British policies. Among these were the Mughal court and the many Muslim individuals who made their way to Delhi and fought as civilian jihadis united against the *kafir* enemy. Yet Harriott's bigoted and Islamophobic argument oversimplified this complex picture down to an easily comprehensible, if quite fictional, global Muslim conspiracy with an appealingly visible and captive hate figure at its centre, towards whom righteous vengeance could now be directed.

While the simplicity of this picture certainly appealed to ignorant and jingoistic newspaper readers in Britain, to anyone in Delhi the argument was clearly flawed, not least because of the demonstrable fact that the hated 'Pandies' had been at least 65 per cent upper-caste Hindu. During the hearing of 3 February, in an attempt to try to prove pre-existing links between the sepoys and Zafar, Harriott had pounced upon a reference to a dozen sepoys who had come before Zafar in 1853 asking whether they could become his *murids* or spiritual disciples. In reality this showed nothing more than the fact that Zafar was treated by some of the faithful as a holy Sufi *pir* possessed of miraculous spiritual powers; but for Harriott this was vital evidence that Zafar had been busy trying to subvert the army for at least three and a half years before the outbreak.<sup>128</sup>

Ommaney for one was quite clear that what the prosecution was alleging was nonsense, and that it showed a complete lack of understanding either of the complexities of Indian society or the various grievances which had led to the Uprising: 'In my opinion,' he wrote in his diary, 'the Musalman origin of the outbreak is a fallacy. The state of feeling in the company's native army is not in anyway alluded to [in Harriott's theory]. The [sepoys in the] army saw they had the power, and determined to try and conquer the country. That the Musalmen joined the army does not in anyway prove that the rebellion was of Musalman origin …'<sup>129</sup>

Indeed, as witness after witness appeared in the box it became increasingly clear that Zafar was wholly ignorant of any plans that may have existed for a co-ordinated uprising, and had all along been innocent of doing anything other than trying to protect his subjects in Delhi. 'It appeared from what I gathered', wrote one spectator at the trial, Mrs Muter,

'that he [Zafar] had condemned the [massacre carried out by] the Nana at Cawnpore; and there was abundant proof that he had striven hard to protect the citizens of Delhi from violence of the soldiery and outrages of the nobles, and the people of the country from the plunder by Gujars.'

It was clear how wretched the old man had been when eddied about in the whirlwind of the Mutiny with no energy to control, and no force of will to rule the cruel natures around. Numerous petitions from the people were translated, with the King's remarks. Much of what he said was sound and good, and his complaints were bitter of the insolence of the sepoys … How keenly he felt the thorns in the bed which had been prepared for him. He was a mere puppet …

I cannot think that in the treatment of the last of the House of Timour our country showed her usual liberality. We must keep the fact ever before us, that it was our army that set the country in a blaze – that it was our timidity that led to the catastrophe; and that we did not even have the excuse that the Mutiny was an unforeseen event.

Amid all the poverty and contempt thrown on the King, I was gratified to observe the demeanour of many of the witnesses when called to give evidence. Bowing to the ground with hands clasped before the miserable figure on the bed, addressed by them as 'Ruler of the Universe' though by the committee as *tum* (a mode of address only used to inferiors and servants), they observed to the powerless old man a degree of respect denied to the court, who had only to nod the signal for their execution.<sup>130</sup>

The trial dragged on for two months. Often it had to be adjourned owing to Zafar's ill health. On one occasion the Emperor was carried groaning from court. During the early stages of the trial his face had shown signs of anxiety and alarm, but as the weeks went on 'by degrees it became more vacant, and he assumed or felt indifference, remaining apparently in a state of lethargy, with his eyes closed during the greater part of the proceedings'.<sup>131</sup>

The court martial sat for the last time on 9 March, and at 11 a.m., in front of a crowded courtroom, Harriott made his closing speech. For two and a half hours, he again elaborated his theory of the Uprising being an

international Islamic conspiracy. 'I have endeavoured to point out', he declaimed, 'how intimately the prisoner, as the head of the Mahommedan faith in India, has been connected with the organisation of that conspiracy, either as its leader or its unscrupulous accomplice …'

After what has been proved in regard to Mahomedan treachery, is there anyone who hears me that can believe that a deep-planned and well-concerted conspiracy had nothing to do with it … If we now take a retrospective view of the various circumstances which we have been able to elicit during our extended inquiries, we shall see how exclusively Mahommedan are all the prominent points that attach to it. A Mahommedan priest, with pretended visions, and assumed miraculous powers – a Mahommedan King, his dupe and his accomplice – a Mahommedan clandestine embassy to the Mahommedan powers of Persia and Turkey – Mahommedan prophecies as to the downfall of our power – Mahommedan rule as the successor to our own – the most cold blooded murders by Mahommedan assassins – a religious war for Mahommedan ascendancy – a Mahommedan press unscrupulously abetting – and Mahommedan sepoys initiating the mutiny. Hinduism, I may say, is nowhere either reflected or represented …<sup>132</sup>

Harriott then added a concluding passage, criticising the idea that the Uprising could be in any way connected with the activity of Christian missionaries, as some were already suggesting: 'A candid undisguised endeavour to gain followers to Christ', he said, 'has never, that I am aware of, been viewed with the slightest sign of disapprobation by any portion of the natives … Christianity, when seen in its own pure light, has no terrors for the natives …'<sup>133</sup>

Just before 3 p.m., the judges retired to consider their verdict. A few minutes later, they returned to unanimously declare Zafar guilty 'of all and every part of the charges preferred against him'.

Normally, noted the president, such a verdict would have resulted 'in the penalty of death as a traitor and a felon'. Thanks, however, to Hodson's guarantee of his life, such a sentence was impossible. Instead, Zafar was sentenced 'to be transported for the remainder of his days, either to one of

the Andaman Islands or to such other place as may be selected by the Governor General in council'.<sup>134</sup>

There followed a seven-month delay, while letters went back and forth between Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon, the Andamans and even the Cape Colony, as the British tried to find a suitable place to exile Zafar. There were also anxieties that a rescue attempt might be mounted if Zafar was to be sent downcountry before fighting had completely ceased in some of the more unsettled parts of eastern Hindustan.

Finally, towards the end of September 1858, it was decided that it was now safe for Zafar to be sent away from Delhi, even though his final destination had yet to be settled. Lieutenant Ommaney was to accompany him into exile, and was to make sure that the State Prisoner (as Zafar was now referred to) should hold no communication with anyone en route.<sup>135</sup>

At 4 a.m. on 7 October, 332 years after Babur first conquered the city, the last Mughal Emperor left Delhi on a bullock cart. Along with him went his wives, his two remaining children,\* concubines and servants – a party of thirty-one in all, who were escorted by the 9th Lancers, a squadron of horse artillery, two palanquins and three palanquin carriages. The journey had been kept secret, even from Zafar himself, and the old man knew nothing of his departure before being woken up by Ommaney at 3 a.m. one day and told to get ready.

'He was removed as quickly as possible,' wrote Matilda Saunders to her mother-in-law the following week. 'Everything was kept quite secret, though of course C[harles Saunders] knew it long before, and had been buying up conveyances for them to travel in covered carriages and palanquins &c and bullock carts and tent equipage &c.'

There was nothing wanting in the forethought and arrangements and at 3 in the morning the dear fellow [Saunders] left his bed in the fort and assisted his able co-adjuter, Mr Ommaney, in packing them

up. At 4 he made them over to a guard of the Lancers and saw them safely over the Bridge of Boats on their way down country. The King is a blessed riddance to Dehli. His two Queens accompany him, and his two younger sons, and the wife of the elder one, besides collateral branches that had the option of staying but preferred to share the fate of the royal party.

She added: 'No one crowded to see them go; it was completely still and quiet at that early hour."<sup>136</sup>
