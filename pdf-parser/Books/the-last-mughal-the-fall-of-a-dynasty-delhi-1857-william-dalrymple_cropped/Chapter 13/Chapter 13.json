He then stripped the corpses of their signet rings and turquoise <i>bazubands</i> (armlets), which he pocketed, and seized their bejewelled swords. The following day Hodson wrote to his sister, saying that however exhausted he was from his various exertions, 'I cannot help being pleased with the warm congratulations I received on all sides for my success in destroying the enemies of our race. The whole nation will rejoice.' He added: 'I am not cruel, but I confess I did enjoy the opportunity of ridding the earth of these wretches.'<sup>12</sup></p>",

Hugh Chichester wrote that 'There has been nothing but shooting these villains for the last three days, some 3 or 400 were shot yesterday,' noting that while some young boys that the British came across were allowed to pass freely out of the city gates, 'most of them are put to death'.<sup>30</sup> According to Major William Ireland, 'Offenders who were seized were handed over to a military commission to be tried. The work went on with celerity. Death was almost the only punishment, and condemnation almost the only issue of a trial. The gentlemen who had to judge offenders were in no mood for leniency.'<sup>31</sup> It was not just bloodlust and the urge for revenge which provided the motive for this mass slaughter: there was also money to be made. Informers were paid 2 rupees for every arrest, while the captors were allowed to keep 'all money and gold found on the persons of mutineers captured'.<sup>32</sup></p>",

Here he ate his first proper meal for many days.

One unfortunate group of <i>salatin</i> thought to be imprisoned in Agra, and then sought for in Kanpur, were eventually found to have been in Allahabad Jail, but recently had moved to Calcutta for forwarding to the Andamans; they were on the point of embarking there when they were sent instead into exile in Karachi at the other end of India. In the end, the survivors – including several who had not been arrested and were living peaceably in Delhi – were divided between a small number who were sent to Karachi, and the great majority of the male <i>salatin</i> who were exiled to Moulmein in Burma.</p>",

There he strung up from the charred beams any Indian he took to be an offender – an explicit statement of retribution for the destruction of his family's seat and the betrayals he believed he had personally suffered. One case recorded in the <i>Delhi Gazetteer</i> concerned a village that had given up one of Theo's servants to the rebels.

So while the details remain hazy, the fact that Theo was singled out for his readiness to shoot and hang implies that he was believed responsible for a quite exceptional number of arbitrary killings. Rumours of his excesses even began to reach Sir John Lawrence in Lahore, who quickly became concerned at the reports that 'civil officers [are] hanging at their own will and pleasure'. Before long Lawrence began to make enquiries as to whether Theo needed reining in, or even to be suspended from the service. 'If what I have heard is at all true,' wrote Lawrence to Saunders, 'it is our duty to interfere and not allow Metcalfe the power of life and death. [My informants] seemed to feel strongly that his fervor is opposed to the just deliberation required in a Special Commisioner, and that the sooner the direct power of death is taken from him the better for the interests both of the people and of our administration.'<sup>109</sup></p>",

Translators were sent down from Lahore to help plough through the great stash of paperwork that had been retrieved from both the Palace chancellery and the rebels' camp; the legality and binding nature of the guarantee of his life that Hodson had given Zafar was examined in great detail; and the nature of the Emperor's trial, and the charges that would be brought, were discussed. In the end it was agreed that the guarantee was legally binding, although it had been given contrary to the repeated written instructions of Lord Canning; and it was settled that Zafar would be charged with 'rebellion, treason and murder' and 'not regarding his allegiance' as a British subject by a Military Commission. This would sit to hear the charges at the end of January 1858. Major Harriott, who had successfully prosecuted and hanged most of Zafar's court and family, was now to prosecute the man he made clear he regarded as 'the leading chief of the rebels'.</p>",

Since then, nothing had happened to change the legal relationship of the two parties, for although the Company had unilaterally ceased to offer <i>nazrs</i> and no longer proclaimed its vassalage on its coins or seal, neither Shah Alam, nor Akbar Shah, nor Zafar himself had ever renounced their sovereignty over the Company. From this point of view, Zafar could certainly be tried as a defeated enemy king; but he had never been a subject, and so could not possibly be called a rebel guilty of treason. Instead, from a legal point of view, a good case could be made that it was the East India Company which</p>",

Russell was also very taken with the comforts of Ludlow Castle, Simon Fraser's old residence, which Saunders, the Civil Commissioner, had recently had repaired and refurbished. 'The gharry drove up under the pillared portico,' wrote Russell. 'In a moment out came a ruddy, comely English gentleman, and before I knew where I was, I was ushered into the presence of a fair Englishwoman, who sat at a well furnished board, doing the honours of her table to a circle of guests.'</p>",

Contrary to all the evidence that the Uprising broke out first among the overwhelmingly Hindu sepoys, and that it was high-caste Hindu sepoys who all along formed the bulk of the fighting force; and ignoring all the evident distinctions between the sepoys, the jihadis, the Shia Muslims of Persia and the Sunni court of Delhi, Major Harriott argued that the Mutiny was the product of the convergence of all these conspiring forces around the fanatical Islamic dynastic ambitions of Zafar: 'To Musalman intrigues and Mahommedan conspiracy we may mainly attribute the dreadful calamities of the year 1857,' argued Major Harriott.

During the hearing of 3 February, in an attempt to try to prove pre-existing links between the sepoys and Zafar, Harriott had pounced upon a reference to a dozen sepoys who had come before Zafar in 1853 asking whether they could become his <i>murids</i> or spiritual disciples. In reality this showed nothing more than the fact that Zafar was treated by some of the faithful as a holy Sufi <i>pir</i> possessed of miraculous spiritual powers; but for Harriott this was vital evidence that Zafar had been busy trying to subvert the army for at least three and a half years before the outbreak.<sup>128</sup></p>",
