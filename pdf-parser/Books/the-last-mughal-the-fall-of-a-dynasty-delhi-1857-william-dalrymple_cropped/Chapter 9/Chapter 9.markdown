**7 A PRECARIOUS POSITION**

On 23 May, just as General Anson was finally setting off from Ambala, a rider in ragged Hindustani dress approached the perimeter pickets of the British camp in Karnal and demanded entry. When challenged as to his name and business, the man replied that he was Sir Theophilus Metcalfe. The guards just laughed. The Assistant Magistrate at Delhi had long been presumed dead; indeed, report had it that his head was displayed on a pole outside the Ajmeri Gate. But the stranger's remarkable claim turned out to be true: it was indeed Theo, and he had been on the run for nearly two weeks.

For the first few days after the outbreak, Theo had been sheltered on the roof of the zenana of Bhura Khan Mewati in Paharganj, and had been well looked after and fed; in the evening, he and Bhura Khan used to walk out in the direction of Delhi and watch the burning buildings and, on one night, a display of fireworks celebrating the return of Mughal power. All this time, Theo had expected to hear of the arrival of British troops from Meerut to restore British rule. But on the morning of the fourth day, 14 May, with no sign yet of their arrival, Bhura Khan told Theo that he had heard that he had been tracked to his hiding place, and that if he remained the house would be

attacked and the whole family murdered. Bhura Khan begged him to move to another place, which he would provide for him. According to the memoir of Theo's sister Emily,

In the dusk he took Theophilus to a kunker [limestone] pit, out of which material was taken for road making, in which was a small cave. He provided him with a native sword [tulwar] and a pistol, as Bhura Khan said he would be likely to be followed and attacked. The entrance to the cave was small, and Sir Theophilus felt he was equal to dealing with one man at a time. Either that night or the next, he heard footsteps and voices outside, and awaited the appearance of his assailant. There was sufficient light for him to see a man's figure in the entrance, so he sprang on him and cut him down with his tulwar. 1

Knowing now that his hiding place had been discovered, the following morning Theo sent a message to his friend Muin ud-Din, now Zafar's kotwal, asking for assistance to travel to Jhajjar, where the Nawab was an old friend of the Metcalfe clan. Muin ud-Din had kept in discreet contact with Theo, warning him that there seemed no likelihood of a speedy resolution to the crisis, as both had previously assumed, and 'that whatever must be, would be'. Now he responded by sending 'a good horse, and some money … with advice how to travel … It was arranged that Sir Theophilus should be dressed as a native soldier, and should be called Shere Khan, by which name henceforward he passed in all our communications'.

The next day Muin ud-Din received a formal receipt of the money from Jhajjar. <sup>2</sup> Muin ud-Din assumed that Theo would be safe with the Nawab of Jhajjar since the two were old friends. Like Muin ud-Din's own Loharu clan, the Nawabs of Jhajjar had risen to power as a result of supporting the British, initially against the Marathas at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The Nawab and the Metcalfes also had the common bond of shared tastes: both were enthusiastic patrons of the Company School paintings of the family workshop of Ghulam and Mazhar Ali Khan. While Sir Thomas had commissioned Mazhar Ali Khan to paint the monuments of the town both in his *Dehlie Book* and in his magnificent panoramic scroll of the city, the Nawab had commissioned Ghulam Ali Khan, who was probably Mazhar's uncle, to paint a series of pictures of his court, one in light

summer dress, another with the members of his durbar wrapped in winter shawls; he also commissioned a picture of himself lion hunting and another wonderful image of himself riding around his country garden on his pet tiger. 3

Yet for all this, the Nawab did not greet Theo as expected. On arrival at the palace of the Nawab, Theo

at once demanded an audience as a friend. The Nawab sent back to ask his name, which he gave. He dismounted and was shown into a small room to await his audience. He was kept waiting some time, and then sent a message, to which the Nawab sent an answer, saying he was welcome to the shelter of his home, but that he could not see him.

During the afternoon several messages passed between them, Sir Theophilus expressing surprise that his friend should treat him in such a neglectful manner. Ultimately the Nawab sent his *sarishtadar* [secretary] with a letter in which he said he could not possibly see Sir Theophilus or keep him in the house as he would be attacked by the King of Delhi if he sheltered any Europeans, but that he would provide him with a horse and a guard of two soldiers to show him the way back to Delhi.

As the Nawab was perfectly aware that Sir Theophilus knew the way to Delhi as well as his soldiers did, it was evident that they were to be sent for no friendly purpose. However, finding that he could get nothing else, Sir Theophilus accepted the offer. The pony provided for him was not his own good pony, but a wretched *tat* which could go no pace. He made the soldiers ride in front of him, to show the way as guides, and under cover of darkness, he turned his pony off the main road, into the sandy jungle and got away as fast as he could in the direction of Hansi. His pony was soon knocked up from fatigue and he had to walk day and night, sleeping in the jungle and eating chuppatties and drinking milk given him by villagers on the road. He heard these people discussing how the Europeans (*sahib log*) had been killed and the government transferred to the King of Delhi.

The following morning, Theo had to leave the shelter of the jungle and return to the high road. He had been walking for some time, when

he heard the sound of some horsemen riding in haste, and looking back saw two sawars in the Nawab's uniform approaching so rapidly that they would shortly overtake him. He felt convinced that he was the object of their pursuit, and the only chance of shelter was in a village that he was approaching, and which he had not intended to run the risk of entering.

He had, however, no other choice, and was certain that at this hour of high noon, its inhabitants would be taking their siesta inside or in some shady nook in the streets, wrapped in their long robes, concealing their faces from the heat … Sir Theophilus followed this example and was fortunate enough to take his place among a group of recumbent sleepers. A few minutes later the sawars came, and demanded loudly to be informed where the Englishman was in hiding, but no answer came, since everyone was asleep. One of the sawars then pricked with his lance the man lying next Sir Theophilus, and repeated the enquiry.

The sleeper, indignant at this rude awakening cursed the sawar and said that no Englishman had passed that way. The soldiers hastened on and when the sound of their galloping had died away, [Theo] crept out of the village as secretly as he had entered it, and hastening back to the jungle remained in hiding till, at a late hour, he had the satisfaction of seeing his pursuers return home, balked of their prey … [Several days later] he arrived more dead than alive at Hansi.<sup>4</sup>

In Hansi, Theo made straight for the mansion of another family friend of the Metcalfes, and here he had more luck than in Jhajjar. Alec Skinner was the oldest surviving son of Colonel James Skinner, 'Sikandar Sahib', and the eldest of Elizabeth Wagentrieber's numerous brothers. The Skinners' sprawling Georgian house at Hansi was the mansion her father had built as his principal country seat, and from where in happier days Sikandar had run both his irregular cavlary regiment and his stud.

In the event, however, Theo stayed with the Skinners only one night. The Uprising had not yet spread to Hansi, though the town was tense, and trouble was imminently expected. Instead of resting, as soon as Theo heard from Alec that General Anson was on his way to Karnal, he borrowed a horse and set off at dawn, riding without stopping until he arrived at the British camp. The following day news arrived that the troops in Hansi had broken out in mutiny a few hours after Theo had left; his host and his elderly Muslim mother had had a near-miraculous escape, fleeing through the desert to Bikaner on the back of a single racing camel.

Theo was exhausted and embittered by his ordeal; and his nerves were worn to the point of breakdown. Sir Thomas had always considered Theo unstable and something of a loose cannon; what followed was to prove him right. For Theo was disgusted by what had happened to him and what he had seen; certainly his friends and colleagues soon came to be anxious that the angry, nervy and haunted look that he had when he arrived at Karnal never left him until the end of the Uprising. In the meantime he set out to even the score, as he saw it, and to make sure that those who failed to help him, or murdered his friends or members of his household, were strung up and dealt with, inside or outside the law. As his friend Charles Saunders later put it, 'Metcalfe was so *maddened* with revenge against the Mahometans, that he seemed to have a personal animus fomented by the sight of what he had suffered, and the defection of those whom he had trusted and befriended …'<sup>5</sup>

The following morning Theo wrote to G. B. Thornhill, secretary to the Lieutenant Governor in Agra:

Sir,

I have the honour to inform you that I have reached Kurnul via Hansi from Delhi and although my health is not very good, I write to beg that the Lt Governor will allow me to accompany the force and the Commander in Chief to Delhi in some official capacity: and I trust what local information I possess of the Delhi town and district may be of service to Government … I shall be happy at all times to serve where I can be of best use, but after eight years connection with Delhi, I naturally, in this great emergency, flatter myself that so long a connection will ensure me employment there.

I have the honour to be, your obedient servant

## T METCALFE<sup>6</sup>

In due course Theo's petition was granted; but as subsequent events were to show, it would have been much better for everyone if his request had been turned down.

![](_page_5_Picture_2.jpeg)

Theo was not alone. All over Hindustan, troops, dacoits, tribesmen and refugees were all on the move, and by no means all of the latter were British. A couple of days behind Theo, for example, on the same road, was the great Urdu literary critic Hali.

After having been tracked down by his family while he was studying at the 'very spacious and beautiful' madrasa of Husain Bakhsh, Hali went back with them to Panipat, which lay a little south of Karnal, on the Grand Trunk Road. A year later, in 1856, his wife gave birth to an infant son, and Hali realised he must now find a job. He went alone to the administrative centre of Hissar, a few miles from the Skinners' house at Hansi, and though he had no connections or references, eventually found a job in the Deputy Collector's Office. He was still working there when the Uprising broke out.

After a combination of mutinous sepoys – led by the future British spy Brigade Major Gauri Shankar Sukul – and Mewati tribesman rose up, murdered the collector, and marched off with the treasury to join Zafar's army at Delhi, Hali had little choice but to set off, 'taking his life in his hands', and return home to Panipat. On the way he was seized by Gujars and robbed of his horse. Walking the rest of the way, begging for food, he arrived home with so bad a case of dysentery, and so raddled by exposure, that despite being treated by a celebrated hakim, he was sick for more than a year, and suffered for the rest of his life from a weak stomach, chest and lungs.<sup>7</sup>

Edward Vibart's party suffered just as badly. After having fled Metcalfe House less than an hour before it was attacked and burned, they wandered onward trying to find a place to ford the deep Yamuna canal. To their alarm,

they realised that the only way to do so was to double back and cross just below the cantonments. In the hours after darkness fell, this was the most dangerous place in Delhi: the rebel sepoys had congregated there to vent their rage on the Company by looting, destroying and burning down every British bungalow. 'With beating hearts, we crept along the canal-bank,' remembered Vibart in his memoirs,

and gradually approached the flaming cantonments; but although the forms of numberless marauders were distinctly visible in the act of plundering the adjacent bungalows, we passed on unobserved, and, to our inexpressible relief, found the ford we were in search of without a soul in the immediate vicinity.

We at once prepared to cross over, hoping to place some three or four miles between ourselves and cantonments ere morning broke. It was found not quite such an easy matter, however, to get the ladies across, as the water was considerably deeper than we anticipated, and on my going in to lead the way, I found the water breast-high.<sup>8</sup>

The group wandered on by the waning light of the moon through a thorny uncultivated plain. The ladies were unused to walking, and by now their feet were blistered and bleeding. More worryingly, Mr Forrest was beginning to behave oddly after his severe shock at the explosion of the magazine earlier in the day: he was beginning to lag badly behind, occasionally disappearing altogether. By dawn the refugees had gone no more than three miles from the cantonments, and were becoming increasingly aware that the only weapons they had between them were two old regimental swords and a doublebarrelled fowling piece. Having made their way to some scrub jungle, they all lay down among the brushwood and, worn out with fatigue, began to drowse. 'I was just on the point of dropping off to sleep,' wrote Vibart, 'when suddenly someone shook me by the arm, exclaiming the sepoys were upon us.'

Not one hundred yards distant, and coming in a direct line towards us, we perceived a body of some eight or ten sepoys, stragglers from Meerut, two of whom were mounted on ponies. The imperfect light of the dawning day was just sufficient to show us they were

armed, though only half were dressed in uniform. They were making for Delhi by a country track, and were bearing down straight for the spot where we lay concealed … We had barely time to creep under the bushes and hide ourselves as well as we could when they were upon us. We watched them in breathless anxiety, not daring to move, and scarcely to breathe.

Now they slowly pass in Indian file within a few feet of us … One of them stoops and picks up something from the ground, and whispers to his comrades, and then all come to a sudden halt. Alas! Our water bottle has betrayed us! In our hurry and confusion we had left it lying in the open … There was complete silence, broken only by the low mutterings of the sepoys … I involuntarily cocked my gun … [But] after a brief interval we saw them silently move off …<sup>9</sup>

During the following days, however, the group's luck ran out. Wandering aimlessly in the heat through a bare plain in what they hoped would be the direction of Meerut, without food or money, they watched as Forrest descended into distracted madness, hiding in bushes and refusing to follow, 'saying he felt so thoroughly worn out from all he had gone through that he would far rather be left in peace to die where he was'. Two days later, they met another equally ragged party of Delhi refugees, led by Vibart's commanding officer, Colonel Knyvett, raising the number in the party to seventeen. Shortly afterwards, however, they were all surrounded

by fierce looking men, armed with spears and bludgeons. These were none other than the dreaded Gujars themselves. Their numbers increased rapidly, and, in whichever direction we looked, we observed others, similarly armed, running towards us. At length when they had completely hemmed us in, they gave a fearful shout, and rushed upon us. We stood back to back, and made a vain attempt to beat them off; but, being [outnumbered] ten to one, we were soon overpowered. One rascal laid hold of my sword, and tried to wrench it out of my hand. In vain I resisted; a blow from behind stretched me on my back …

In the midst of all this melee I saw Colonel Knyvett levelling the gun he was carrying point-blank at one of the wretches … fortunately someone shouted out to him not to fire; so, deliberately removing the caps, he gave it up. It was as well we permitted ourselves to be disarmed for had we continued the struggle, our lives would undoubtedly have been sacrificed.

Having once got us down, they set to work stripping us of everything. Studs, rings, watches, etc. were all torn off. They did not even spare my inner vest … One of the ladies literally had the clothes torn off her back, whilst the others were treated with similar barbarity. At last when they had appropriated everything, leaving only our shirts and trousers, and the ladies their upper garments, the entire band retreated a short distance and commenced quarrelling over the spoil.<sup>10</sup>

Three further days of parched, thirsty wandering later, after Forrest had again disappeared and been found, a second Gujar war band surrounded the party, but 'finding nothing to rob us of, contented themselves with pulling off the gilt buttons on the colonel's frockcoat, which the other rascals had overlooked, and permitted us to pass on'.<sup>11</sup>

Help, when it finally arrived a full week after the party had fled Delhi, came from the most unlikely quarter. Franz Gottlieb Cohen, who wrote 'a camel load of poetic works' in Persian and Urdu under the pen-name 'Farasu', was one of the last of the White Mughals, an eighty-year-old relic of a very different and less polarised era.<sup>12</sup> The son of a German-Jewish soldier of fortune who had married a Mughal princess, Farasu was born in 1777 while his father was in the service of the enigmatic Begum Sumru of Sardhana.<sup>13</sup>

The Begum Sumru presided over one of the most fascinatingly hybrid courts in India. She was originally said to have been a Kashmiri dancing girl named Farzana Zeb un-Nissa, born 1751, whose rapid rise to fortune began when she became the *bibi* of a German mercenary, Walter Reinhardt, known as 'Sombre' (Indianised to 'Sumru') after his severe expression. When the Mughal Emperor gave Reinhardt a large estate in the Doab north of Delhi, Reinhardt's begum went with him and turned the village of Sardhana into their capital, with a ruling class drawn from both Mughal

noblemen and a ragged bunch of over two hundred ne'er-do-well French and central European mercenaries, many of whom apparently converted to Islam.<sup>14</sup> Among these mercenaries was Farasu's father, John-Augustus Gottlieb Cohen.

After Sombre's death, his begum ruled in his stead, partly from Sardhana, and partly from her large Delhi palace on Chandni Chowk. She converted to Catholicism – while continuing to cover her head in the Muslim manner – and appealed directly to the Pope to send a chaplain for her court. By the time the intriguingly named Father Julius Caesar turned up in Sardhana, the begum had already begun to build the largest cathedral in northern India, in a style that promiscuously mixed baroque and Mughal motifs, with a great classical dome rising from Mughal squinches decorated with honeycombed Persian *murqana* motifs.\* 15

As the architecture of her cathedral indicated, there was nothing orthodox about the begum's Christianity. The three-day-long Christmas festivities at Sardhana were opened by high mass, while 'the following two days [were enlivened] by a nautch and a display of fireworks'. This was an opportunity for the Sardhana poets, including Farasu, to recite their Urdu verses.<sup>16</sup> Dussera, Diwali and Holi were celebrated with equal enthusiasm; in addition to which the begum also dabbled in witchcraft – the diary of her heir, the wonderfully named David Ochterlony Dyce Sombre, contains several references to the begum's employing women to cast spells and conduct exorcisms.<sup>17</sup>

Three of the begum's European mercenary officers became major Urdu poets, of whom the most distinguished was Farasu; he was even included in the list of the most prominent Indian poets produced by the principal of Delhi College, Alois Sprenger. According to the Persian inscription on Farasu's tomb, 'he was in the service of Her Highness for 50 years, the last 32 as *tahsildar* of Budhana'.<sup>18</sup>

After the British unilaterally annexed the begum's estate on her death, Farasu, now an old man, continued as *tahsildar* under the British, based in his rambling haveli in the village of Harchandpur.\* It was from here that he sent out search parties as soon as news reached him that half-naked British refugees were wandering around his estates, starving and thirsty. '[When] a messenger arrived from Harchandpore, saying his master, a Mr Cohen, hearing of our miserable plight, had sent him to express his sympathy at our

situation, and begging us to take shelter with him … we were naturally overjoyed,' wrote Vibart.

Arriving there between seven and eight o'clock, we were cordially welcomed by the old man and his two grandsons. It appeared they owned several villages round about, for which they annually paid a certain sum to the government. The old man himself had lived here all his life – so long in fact that he had almost forgotten his own language, and had become thoroughly native in all his habits; but his two grandsons were somewhat different in this respect, and lived in a more European fashion.

We were soon refreshed with a cup of hot tea, after which clean clothes were brought, and we proceeded to divest ourselves of the soiled rags we were wearing, and enjoyed the luxury of soap and water. A room was set apart for the ladies of the party, and they too managed to procure a change of apparel, in the shape of some clean *koortas* and snowy white *chuddahs* of fine nankeen, which later they wore over their heads and draped around their shoulders in native style, and really looked so spruce and tidy in their novel costume, when they joined us at breakfast [the following morning], that we could scarcely recognise them as the forlorn creatures of yesterday …

As for Forrest … he remained shut up in old Mr Cohen's 'sanctum sanctorum,' enjoying the luxury of a punkah and smoking a fragrant hookah … At four o'clock pm a plentiful repast was set before us, and to our no small astonishment, several bottles of beer produced, followed, when dinner was removed, by a bottle of excellent cognac …<sup>19</sup>

Shortly afterwards, alerted by Farasu, a rescue party and an escort of cavalry arrived from Meerut. It was now eight days since the party had fled Delhi. By the following night, all seventeen refugees were safe within the shelter of the now heavily fortified and entrenched British cantonment at Meerut.

![](_page_11_Picture_0.jpeg)

Eight days later, on the evening of 27 May, General Wilson finally gathered enough bullocks to leave Meerut in belated pursuit of the mutineers. His small force numbered only 2,000 infantry, fifty cavalry and six guns; its destination was Alipore, 8 miles north of Delhi, where it was supposed to rendezvous with the main Field Force heading south from Ambala.

Before leaving, Wilson – a small, neat, goateed gentleman of sixty – wrote confidently to his wife, who was up in the hill station of Mussoorie, that 'the mutineers … show no wish to come and attack us'.<sup>20</sup> In this, as in so many other things, General Wilson was proved quite wrong. Zafar had in fact been urging an attack on Meerut for some time, largely with a view to getting as many sepoys as he could out of both his palace and his city. The expedition also had the added recommendation of providing a way to remove from the Red Fort Zafar's troublesome grandson, the new commander of the cavalry, Mirza Abu Bakr.

Since his promotion to lead the rebel *sawars* a fortnight earlier, Mirza Abu Bakr had become a major liability. Liberated from his former status as a minor princeling, he had begun swaggering around with his troops, committing outrages both in the city and around about. Sent out to defend the suburbs against Gujars, he had looted both the Sabzi Mandi, the area around Safdarjung's Tomb, and Gurgaon: 'the said Mirza plundered the region and set fire to it', recorded one Urdu newsletter. <sup>21</sup> Shortly afterwards he had led an expedition to Rohtak with Mir Nawab, 'the leader of the city rebels', where, according to one eyewitness, they

plundered and burnt every house in the Civil Lines, looted the city, maltreated the males and outraged the women. Mir Nawab himself carried off three fair Hindoo girls loaded with costly ornaments. Mirza Abu Bukr and his army of oppressors then returned to Delhi bringing the whole of the government treasure and accompanied by the traitorous sepoy guard.<sup>22</sup>

Since then he and the Mir Nawab had amused themselves attacking the haveli of the leader of Delhi's Shia community, Hamid Ali Khan, 'bringing up guns against the house to blow him away on the [quite unfounded] pretext that he was in league with the English'. Zafar was outraged when a distress message from Hamid Ali Khan reached him and demanded that the assault stop immediately. But when he instructed the cavalry not to obey Abu Bakr's orders they refused, replying, 'He is our officer. Why should we not go where he tells us?'<sup>23</sup> Abu Bakr was briefly suspended from command of the cavalry, but the order seems to have been ignored.<sup>24</sup> So when Zafar heard that Mirza Abu Bakr now wished to lead an expedition against the British in Meerut, he was only too pleased to let him go, ordering him 'to go with his troops towards Meerut where there are English cannon which he must capture and deliver as soon as possible'.<sup>25</sup>

An expedition to Meerut had in fact been canvassed for some time by Maulvi Muhammad Baqar in the *Dihli Urdu Akbhar*, and recently his editorials had begun to complain about the unnecessary delays in the departure of the expeditionary force: 'Every day there is news that the troops are about to leave for Meerut, but it never seems to happen,' he wrote on 31 May.

The wise have long been saying that no delay should be made in taking Meerut and Karnal, and the Christians cannot prosper when opposed by the Almighty … The exalted Murshidzada Mirza Abu Bakr is very keen to lead such an expedition and has in fact pleaded before his Majesty to let him take a sizeable contingent. He should be given his way as then the matter could be quickly settled.<sup>26</sup>

There followed one final delay when the sepoys insisted that Zafar accompany them to battle, saying:

'You will then see how we will fight for you.' The King replied that he was old and infirm, could with difficulty move about, and had been unable to go even as far as the 'Idgah on the great day of prayer ['Id], even though it was close outside the city walls. Nor had he or his ancestors from the time of Furuksiyar, a period of 108 years, ever seen a battle, adding, 'I know nothing of military tactics,

but you do.' The officers replied that if unable to go himself he must send one of his sons.<sup>27</sup>

Finally, two days before Wilson left Meerut, on 25 May, 'under pressure from the King', a large force of sepoys, supported by field and horse artillery under Mirza Abu Bakr, set off from Delhi in a bid to take Meerut.<sup>28</sup> Neither side had any idea that an army belonging to the other was heading in its direction.

![](_page_13_Picture_2.jpeg)

Wilson's march from Meerut proved as chaotic as Anson's had been from Simla. No camels could be found, and the rustic bullock carts the British had commandeered proved quite unsuitable for transporting an army. <sup>29</sup> 'It was a dreadful mess of confusion this first march,' he admitted to his wife on the 28th, 'but I hope we shall do better tonight. Our carriage is chiefly hackeries, a source of very great trouble and inconvenience.'<sup>30</sup>

Wilson did not mention it, but his march had also been remarkable for its brutal and unfocused attempts at taking revenge on any of the local population who were unfortunate enough to come in the way of his column: according even to the Anglophile policeman Sa'id Mubarak Shah, who was no critic of the British, 'Reprisals were taken as the troops advanced, and hundreds of innocent travellers, as well as [genuine] dacoits and highway robbers were seized and hanged.'<sup>31</sup>

The two rival expedionary forces finally met, to the great surprise of both, at the new British-built steel suspension bridge over the Hindan river, at half past four in the afternoon of 30 May. The first short engagement ended in the British crossing the bridge and driving back the sepoys with only light casualties; but the rebels returned at 1 p.m. the following day for a much more fiercely fought engagement.32 According to Muin ud-Din,

The battle began with artillery fire. [Mirza Abu Bakr] mounted onto the roof of a house near the River Hindan close to the bridge across

the river and watched the battle. From time to time he sent messages to his artillery to tell them of the havoc their fire was creating in the English ranks.

Near the bridge he placed a battery with which he carried on an exchange of fire with the English, which became like a conversation of question and answer. Presently a shell burst near the battery, covering the gunner with dust … [Mirza Abu Bakr] experiencing for the first time the effects of a bursting shell, hastily descended from the roof of the house, mounted his horse, and galloped off with his escort of sawars far into the rear of the position, not heeding the cries of his troops.

A general stampede then took place. When the news reached Delhi that the troops had been defeated, orders were issued to close the gates and exclude the sepoys. When these arrived they found the Yamuna Bridge [of Boats] had been broken down.\* In a hurried attempt to cross it the bridge gave way, and about two hundred were drowned.<sup>33</sup>

Although Wilson had won an important and symbolic victory, the artillery of the sepoys had been much more effective than anticipated and British casualties had been severe; indeed, it almost stopped Wilson's advance dead in its tracks: 'My loss has been heavy,' he wrote that evening to his wife, 'and such as I can ill afford with my small force. Another such victory would annihilate me.'<sup>34</sup> He himself was nearly killed twice when showers of grape twice whistled around him, but left him miraculously unhurt.<sup>35</sup>

Moreover, there was still no sign of General Barnard's Delhi Field Force, and the horse artillery of Major Tombs, whose rapid manoeuvres had been the key to the British victory, was now virtually out of ammunition: 'I am left with my small force to withstand the whole strength of the insurgents,' Wilson wrote anxiously on 1 June.<sup>36</sup> Briefly he considered retreating back to Meerut, but the following day he was unexpectedly reinforced by the Sirmoor Regiment of Gurkhas and a party of sappers who had marched down from Dehra Dun, and who were also looking for General Barnard.<sup>37</sup> 'I found Brigadier Wilson in rather an awkward predicament,' wrote Colonel Reid, the commander of the Sirmoor

Regiment, 'and dreading another attack … He was rejoiced at my having joined him so soon, and was quite taken by surprise.'<sup>38</sup>

In the meantime, however, as Wilson hesitated, the momentum of the victory at the Hindan Bridge was lost. As Muin ud-Din noted,

The sepoys had now contended with the English on the open field. They had felt certain of success, but they had been worsted, and were filled with grave apprehension for the future … [But] the English did not follow up the victory; they were not to be seen, and gradually the sepoys forgot their fright.<sup>39</sup>

![](_page_15_Picture_3.jpeg)

If Barnard's force was making frustratingly slow progress to the rendezvous with Wilson, one reason was the number of Indians it casually slaughtered as it passed down the Grand Trunk Road: 'I don't consider niggers in the same light as I would a white man,' one officer wrote to his brother from the march. 'To be gracious or merciful to these cruel brutes, these cowardly monsters, is nothing more nor less than to be absurd in their own eyes whilst you certainly don't advance your own cause.'<sup>40</sup>

The night before the Field Force met up with Wilson, a particularly bloody incident had occurred at the village of Rhai after 'a man of the 9th Lancers found under the bridge of a small dried up watercourse a little [British] child's foot still in the shoe, cut off at the ankle joint'.<sup>41</sup> Richard Barter, a twenty-nine-year-old lieutenant with the 75th Gordon Highlanders, was asleep in his tent when the foot was brought in at the height of the day's heat, around 2 p.m.

Immediately after there arose the hum of voices like the sound of some huge bee-hive disturbed, there was a rush of many feet, and in an incredibly short space of time every village within reach of the camp was in a blaze; several officers joined in the performance …

nine [villagers] were hung from a large tree by the roadside after parade.<sup>42</sup>

Theo Metcalfe, it emerged later, was one of the leaders of the lynch mobs.

![](_page_16_Picture_2.jpeg)

For many in the Field Force, the reports of the atrocities performed by the mutinous sepoys – already fanned by hearsay to include non-existent mass rapes – just went to confirm their own existing prejudices. For Robert Dunlop, a Scottish civilian who had volunteered to join an irregular cavalry unit known as the Khaki Risalah, the slaughter of innocent women and children in Delhi and Meerut proved to his own satisfaction what he had already long believed about

the weak and childish but cruel and treacherous native character … It is a patent fact that the proud contempt which the Anglo-Saxon bears to the Asiatic has proved, to a great extent, the salvation of our Indian Empire. Nearly all men come to this country fully prepared to accord equal rights and privileges to its dusky inhabitants; but … experience leads to a common conviction of their debasement.<sup>43</sup>

One woman on the march who stood out against such nakedly racist attitudes was Harriet Tytler. After escaping from Delhi, she and her husband had made their way to Ambala, where Robert, unemployed after the disintegration of his regiment, the 38th Native Infantry, managed to get a new appointment in charge of the Field Force's military treasure chest. Marching now slowly back along the road down which they had fled so desperately three weeks earlier, the Tytlers were horrified by the wanton brutality of the British troops they marched alongside. The same day on which the child's foot was brought into the camp, the now heavily pregnant Harriet saw

a poor little man, a Mohammedan baker, in clean white clothes dangling from the branch of an acacia tree. From what we could gather, this poor man had been late for several days with his bread for the men's breakfast, so Tommie Atkins\* threatened to hang him if it happened again and so they did. I can't understand how such a cruel deed was allowed, for they in their turn should have been hanged, but I suppose a single soldier could not have been spared, even in the cause of justice. Probably most of those who committed this deed were themselves called to account to a Higher Power during their siege to answer for their sins.<sup>44</sup>

A little later Robert Tytler managed to save a camp follower from a similar fate:

Just outside my husband's tent, we heard a piteous cry from a poor old man of *'Duha' i Sahib Kee, Duha' i Sahib Kee'* ('Mercy sirs, Mercy sirs') and saw some of the soldiers dragging him away, evidently to hang him. I sent my husband flying after them, telling them to save the poor old man. As soon as he got up to them he said, 'Boys what are you going to do with that poor old man?'

'Why hang him, sir, of course. He is a Pandee (a rebel).\* We saw him dancing before his bullocks.'

Captain Tytler replied, 'Nonsense boys, he is no Pandee, only a bullock cart driver.'

Oh no, we know he is a Pandee sir,' ejaculated all the men.

My husband replied again, 'I see you boys only want a little fun. Let the poor chap go and run after that dog and hang him instead.'

I see sir, that you don't want us to hang him.'

'No indeed I don't.'

So they let him go and ran after a dog, and strung him up there and then.<sup>45</sup>

On Trinity Sunday, 7 June, General Wilson finally led his forces into General Barnard's newly pitched camp at Alipore, 8 miles north of Delhi. Here Theo was introduced to his new boss, Hervey Greathed, formerly the Commissioner of Meerut, who was the most senior British civilian officer

with the Field Force: '[Metcalfe] says he is well enough to work,' wrote Greathed, 'and his knowledge of Delhi will prove very useful to me.' The two worked well together: I like Metcalfe very much,' wrote Greathed a little later. 'He is a most cheery, merry fellow, – nothing puts him out.'<sup>46</sup>

Here too Theo received word of his sister GG and her husband Edward Campbell: the latter had managed to escape unscathed when his troops broke out into mutiny at Sialkot, and he had since made his way to Simla, where he was reunited with the pregnant GG in Constantia, the house where they had been married in 1852. But almost immediately Edward had been ordered to march down to join Theo in the Delhi Field Force: 'We are watching anxiously the progress of the army towards Delhi,' he wrote to his mother soon after his arrival in Simla. 'Much depends on the way it is handled … We are now all in God's hands.'<sup>47</sup>

Also in the Field Force's Alipore camp was William Hodson and his spymaster Rajab Ali, busy co-ordinating the reports now flowing in from their spies in Delhi. Hodson was deeply depressed at the slowness of the Field Force to engage with the sepoys: 'All Rohilcund is in Mutiny,' he wrote to his wife. 'In fact the district of Agra is the only one in the North West Provinces now under our control. What a terrible lesson on the evils of delay. It will be long yet, I fear, ere this business is over.' He added: 'Yet personally I have no reason to complain.'<sup>48</sup>

When the Field Force marched out of camp at 1 a.m. on the morning of 8 June, Hodson was in the lead, scouting ahead, and it was he who shortly afterwards brought news of the newly fortified rebel front line that had been erected just ahead of the British forces around the old Mughal caravanserai of Badli ki Serai.

Mirza Mughal had not wasted the time between the defeat at Hindan Bridge and the arrival of the Delhi Field Force at Alipore.

Teams of workmen had been pressed into service repairing the neglected walls of Delhi, while batteries of artillery had been erected at Salimgarh, on

several of the bastions on the city walls, and also outside the city along the Ridge, the rocky spine of the Aravalli Hills to the north-east of the cantonments. The orders from Mirza Mughal's secretariat to the kotwal are full of urgency: 'Collect as many labourers as can be gathered for finishing the batteries. This is of the utmost urgency. Do not delay. I will not accept any excuses or laziness on the part of you or your staff.'<sup>49</sup> Other orders ask for camels, bullock carts, panniers to carry dirt, axes, shovels, water carriers and for yet more coolies to help in constructing entrenchments.<sup>50</sup>

Most impressive of all was a strong defensive position Mirza Mughal had caused to be established at an old caravanserai on the Grand Trunk Road, blocking access to Delhi from the north. It was an ideal place for a stand. With marshland on either side, a line of artillery had been entrenched between the serai and a small hillock to the west, straddling both sides of the road and providing a small but bristling Mughal Maginot Line: any force coming from the direction of Alipore would have no option but to charge down a narrow causeway straight into the face of the massed Mughal guns.

A large infantry force commanded by Mirza Khizr Sultan, and assisted by the chief eunuch, Mahbub Ali Khan, was sent up at 6 p.m. on the 7th, and placed between and behind the batteries to await the imminent British assault, which was expected on the morning of the 8th. Before they went, Mahbub Ali Khan 'distributed tasty bread and *nuqul* [small, hard sweets, made of jaggery, cashews, almonds and sesame seeds] among the soldiers. The subahdars of the sepoys kissed the feet of the King, and so left for battle'.51 Alerted by the sound of a bugle blowing, Zahir Dehlavi looked out from the walls of the Red Fort, and watched the troops and ammunition train leaving the city, wondering what the morning would bring.<sup>52</sup>

A few hours later, Mirza Mughal sent his father a note, assuring him that he need not be anxious. 'Lord and World-refuge, peace!' he wrote.

May Your Majesty's mind be secure from any fear of our enemies: your servant has been for the last two days, together with his troops, present at the trenches. Wherever the trench-diggers are, there he is. Rest assured our enemies will come no closer – I have brought all the troops to the front line to slay the infidels. Battle is about to be

joined, and with God's undiminished grace Your Majesty is about to witness the conquest of his enemies.<sup>53</sup>

When the British forces began to move forward at 1 a.m., Richard Barter of the 75th Gordon Highlanders found himself in the front line.

Three hours of marching later, just after 4.20 a.m., the rebel position came into view in the darkness, illuminated by a single bonfire that had been lit by the sepoy gunners. 'A jet of smoke went up from a small mound near the fire,' he wrote afterwards,

and presently a round shot from a large piece of ordnance came tearing through some trees to the right of the road. The order was now given to the 75th to wheel [to the right] … whilst our deployment was going on another shot came from the Enemy and striking the horse of Grant, our interpreter, full in the chest, passed clean through his body and out at his tail, giving his rider a nasty fall but not hurting him otherwise. Immediately after there was a cry to my left close to where Grant's horse had been killed and I saw our first wounded man fall to the rear with his arm smashed by a shot.

They were coming in thick and fast now, and as we were directly in front of the enemy's battery and they had our range exactly, the General ordered the 75th to lie down while the other regiments were getting into position. I was not at all sorry to dismount and made myself as small as I possibly could, while the shot went shrieking over our heads with the peculiar sound which once heard is never forgotten. After a few minutes the order came, 'The 75th will advance and take that battery.' In an instant the line was up.

Soon our fellows were dropping fast … their shot striking the line at every discharge. I remember one in particular taking a man's head off, or rather smashing it to pieces and covering my old

Colour Sergeant Walsh with blood and brains so that it was some time before he could see again.

Barter's troops soon got to within 150 yards of the sepoys' batteries, and could see their infantry drawn up in line on the low ground, firing at the advancing British.

Gaps were made in the different Companies only to be filled up the next moment, and still the line advanced … I saw a shrapnel shell burst exactly in the faces of one of the Companies of the right wing. It tore a wide gap and the men near it involuntarily turned away. I called out, 'Don't turn men, don't turn,' and was at once answered 'Never fear Mister Barter sir, we ain't agoing to turn.' And on they went quietly closing up the gap made by their fallen comrades.

The time had come to end all this and … the order was given '75th prepare to charge' and down went the long line of bayonets … a wild shout, or rather yell of vengeance went up from the line as it rushed to the charge. The enemy followed our movements, their bayonets were also lowered and their advance was steady as they came to meet us, but when the exultant shout arose, they could not stand it, their line wavered and undulated, many began firing with their firelocks at their hips, and at last, as we were closing on them, the whole turned and ran for dear life followed by a shout of derisive laughter from our fellows. In three minutes the 75th stood breathless but victors in the Enemy's battery, capturing the heavy guns in it, and in the large camp to the rear a number of field pieces and heaps of small arms and ammunition.<sup>54</sup>

This capture of the rebels' field guns proved a crucial strategic moment for the British, leaving the sepoy infantry largely unsupported for the rest of the siege.<sup>55</sup>

By eight o'clock in the morning it was all over. One of the first to flee on the rebel side was Mirza Khizr Sultan. He had placed himself at the forefront of the action, wearing 'a very brilliant headpiece which sparkled and glistened in the sun', but as soon as the British round-shot began falling to the Prince's right he retired on the excuse of 'bringing up magazine

stores separated from the main body'.<sup>56</sup> Mahbub Ali Khan tried to stop him running away, but without success, and after that 'nothing could stay the sepoys as they hurried towards the city, pouring through the Kashmir, Lahore and Kabul Gates, leaving the gates open behind them'.<sup>57</sup> According to Sa'id Mubarak Shah, 'vast numbers of the mutineers, horse, foot and artillery were killed and still more wounded that day. Scores of dead were scattered over the battlefield, but most of the wounded either by their own exertions, or assisted by their friends, managed to reach the city'.<sup>58</sup>

For some of the British it proved a bittersweet victory. It was not just that they had suffered more severe casualties than they had expected, and far more than their small force could spare; it was also that among the dead the troops recognised sepoys they had known and befriended. This was particularly so for the officers of the 38th Native Infantry, which had been stationed in the Delhi cantonments until the outbreak, and which was so cut up by the British assault at Badli that it never again took to the field as one body. <sup>59</sup> Passing the battlefield, Robert Tytler saw his old orderly, Thakur Singh, who had begged to come in the carriage with the Tytlers when they were escaping from the Flagstaff Tower, and had been turned down as there was no room; he was lying side by side with his uncle, the regimental havildar, whom the Tytlers had known for over a decade. Harriet jotted down her complicated feelings about the dead sepoys in her memoir: 'I saw some of our fine, tall, handsome men lying somewhat swollen by the heat and stark naked,' she wrote.

Every camp follower had robbed them of their gold and silver and jewels, and the last comers of the clothes on their bodies, leaving the poor fellows just as God made them. Such handsome, splendid specimens of high-casted Hindus. One man a hole as large as a billiard ball through his forehead, a perfect giant in death. At any other time my heart would have been full of pity and sorrow at such awful sights … but I could not help saying 'serves you right for killing our poor women and children who never injured you.'<sup>60</sup>

At eleven o'clock the front line of British troops paused briefly at Ochterlony's old garden, Mubarak Bagh, which he had bought and named for his *bibi*. Barnard, however, decided not to stop his advance, and without

waiting to rest further, pressed on through the burned-out cantonments – 'costly furniture lying about in all directions and the walls of some of the bungalows besmeared with the blood of the victims' – on towards the Ridge.<sup>61</sup> Here he divided his force into two columns so as to be able to attack it from both sides.

On the heights, Mirza Mughal's newly erected batteries were taken with little resistance. According to Zahir Dehlavi, who was watching anxiously from the city walls,

the rebels who were posted on the Ridge seeing their fellow rebels fleeing as fast as they could inside the city, left their posts and abandoned the cannons, tents and all their ammunition and fled into the city. When the English army reached the Cantonment they saw that all the entrenchments on the Ridge were completely quiet. So they went up and occupied those posts, burnt the rebel camps, and turned the abandoned cannon towards the city<sup>62</sup>

The only serious resistance the British met was at the Flagstaff Tower, the scene of such confusion a month earlier. Here alone the sepoys held their ground and 'met the Europeans with a withering volley which killed many and wounded a great number'.<sup>63</sup> Late in the afternoon there was also a belated attempt at a counter-attack up through the Sabzi Mandi. This was driven off by the Gurkhas with the unsheathed kukhri knives.<sup>64</sup> By 5 p.m., the entire Ridge was in British hands.

Soon afterwards the British found that the bullock cart full of bodies from the first British casualties of the outbreak was still standing near the Flagstaff Tower; now all that remained were the victims' bare skeletons and uniforms, the regimental buttons still gleaming.<sup>65</sup>

Meanwhile, down in the city, there was no disguising the scale of the defeat suffered by the sepoys. Zahir Dehlavi was on his way to work at the Palace when he saw the first casualties of the battle pouring in.

About eight in the morning, I was going to the fort to attend to my duty. When I reached the gate of the Johari bazaar, I saw a large number of injured coming to the city. Each injured man was being helped by four or five *Purbias*. The road was discoloured with

dripping blood, bathed in red as if it were Holi. Two mounted soldiers passed close by me. I saw that they had bullet marks on their chest like small holes, and on their backs blood was flowing like a fountain. Their guts must have been in tatters, yet in their right hand they were holding the pistols and also the reins of the horse. There was no pain or panic on their faces, they were well in command of themselves and were talking to each other. To this day I am surprised as to how it was possible for them to survive with such wounds, let alone how were they able to ride in the four miles from the battle.

A little later I saw a mounted soldier galloping fast on a horse. He too was scarred with the deep marks of bullets, and blood was flowing from the wounds like water from a tap, so that he was covered all over with gore. Behind him was another man on foot who had lost his arm. A couple of *Purbias* were with him assuring him that they would take him to the camp hospital from there, but that man was resisting this and telling them to stay away from him. By the time I reached the Fort I had encountered many such injured soldiers.<sup>66</sup>

Amid a rising sense of panic, only Mirza Mughal kept his head, saying that, as in a game of chess, as long as the king was next to the castle, 'he was firmly seated beyond all fear of check mate'.<sup>67</sup>

According to Munshi Jiwan Lal, despite the scale of the British victory, the day marked a major missed opportunity in that they did not attempt to take the city. 'The city people mounted onto the roofs of their houses,' he wrote,

and watched with great fear the distant firing … [They] poured volleys of abuse upon the mutineers who were seen returning to the city, accusing them of cowardice, while the troops at the city gates abused the native cavalry, which returned early in the day and took refuge in the city … Owing to the result of the battle, the soldiers seemed to lose all heart … It is much to be regretted that the English did not advance this day. Had they done so, they would

have taken the city for the gates were open and the city people expressed their surprise at their holding back<sup>68</sup>

Yet there was some wisdom in Barnard's decision to halt at the Ridge, and to secure the heights overlooking the city. That night the British erected their tents in the shelter of the burned-out cantonment bungalows. Having conquered the high ground, and erected their guns overlooking the north wall of the city, it did not, however, take long for them to realise the extreme precariousness of their position, even without risking it further by attempting to press on into the city streets.

In the days that followed, from their observation posts on top of the spine of the Ridge, the British could soon see regiment after mutinous regiment pouring into the city over the Bridge of Boats, and also, more alarmingly, from their own rear down the Grand Trunk Road. Every new body of mutineers arriving only emphasised that there was no prospect of relief, at least on a similar scale, for their own small force.

The next day, as shelling from the rebel batteries in the city began hitting the exposed British positions with surprising force and accuracy, and a steady succession of day and night attacks from the city began to wear away at British numbers, many started to realise that a strange reversal of roles was in the process of taking place. As the chaplain of the Field Force, the Reverend John Edward Rotton, succinctly put it:

To a civilian like myself, I freely confess it did seem to savour of rashness to dream of the capture of Delhi with little more than two battalions of infantry, a small force of European cavalry, and no great strength of artillery … We came to besiege Delhi, but we very soon learnt that, in reality, we were the besieged, and the mutineers the besiegers<sup>69</sup>
