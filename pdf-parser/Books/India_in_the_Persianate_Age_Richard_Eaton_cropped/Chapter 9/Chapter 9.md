# Eighteenth-century Transitions

#### POLITICAL CHANGES, 1707–48

In accordance with Mughal practice, a deadly struggle between 'Alamgir's three surviving sons – A'zam, Mu'azzam and Kam Bakhsh – followed the emperor's death. Prince A'zam, at the time in the Deccan, at once declared his sovereignty and began marching north towards Agra. Prince Mu'azzam, then posted near Peshawar on the north-west frontier, also declared his sovereignty and, adopting the title Bahadur Shah, rapidly marched south, beating A'zam in the race to Agra. In June 1707 he defeated his younger brother, who died in battle near Agra. After spending nearly a year consolidating power in upper India, the new emperor marched to the Deccan to confront 'Alamgir's youngest son, Kam Bakhsh, who had also declared his sovereignty and established himself in Hyderabad. Badly outnumbered, however, he too was killed in battle, thereby completing another war of succession, albeit one far less bloody than the war that had raised 'Alamgir to power.

The succession struggle following 'Alamgir's death differed vastly from that of 1657–9. Whereas the earlier war had been fought between powerful princes backed by substantial households and their allied nobles, the sons of 'Alamgir possessed far smaller

households and fewer resources. This owed in large part to their father's policy of diverting resources from his sons to himself, for fear that one of them might overthrow him, as he had overthrown Shah Jahan. It was therefore the domineering 'Alamgir, not his sons, who was the ultimate arbiter of the fate of their households.<sup>1</sup> Two of his sons spent long periods in imprisonment, one was driven out of the country, and none had led any army in the Deccan after 1702. Some of the empire's most powerful nobles simply sat out the struggle between them, defiantly refusing to support any prince. This reflected the quiet drift of real power from princely households to powerful nobles, some of whom felt sufficiently confident in their autonomy to bargain with the new emperor over administrative appointments. And, once in power, they were able to place limits on the emperor's authority. For example, Zulfiqar Khan, the commander who had seized Raigarh from the Marathas and led the siege of Jinji, pressured Bahadur Shah into appointing him both governor of the Deccan and paymaster general (*mir bakhshi*). The latter position authorized him to approve all ranks and promotions, enabling him to thwart the emperor's ability to enlist new nobles into the corps of imperial *mansabdar*s.

By the time Bahadur Shah died in 1712, the institution of princely households had deteriorated even further. All four of his sons were adults at the time their father came to power and, since they all wished to be at the imperial court at the start of the next, inevitable succession struggle, they simply refused to serve in the provinces as governors. For the first time in Mughal history, all princes remained at court for the duration of their father's reign. But doing so compromised their ability to establish independent power bases, build alliances, tap into provincial revenue streams or acquire the administrative experience that might enhance the likelihood of a vigorous and successful reign. Remaining at court for their entire princely lives meant they had much smaller households. Bahadur Shah's eldest son and eventual successor, Jahandar, had only 300 cavalrymen, in contrast to the tens of thousands maintained by princes of the previous century. 2

Consequently, when Jahandar succeeded to the throne in 1712, he did so mainly because of his lack of political, administrative or military experience or resources, which made him more pliable – and hence attractive – for Zulfiqar Khan, then the empire's most powerful figure. It was he who engineered Jahandar's accession by first forming a troika of Jahandar and two of the prince's brothers against their more experienced and energetic sibling, 'Azim al-Sham, promising that, after the latter was defeated, the empire would be partitioned among the trio. Then, after 'Azim al-Sham had been defeated and killed, Zulfiqar Khan treacherously turned on Jahandar's other two brothers, and when they were disposed of he escorted his royal patron to the Peacock Throne. Most of the followers of Jahandar's three brothers were then imprisoned and their property confiscated, while several prominent nobles were publicly executed. It was the first time that supporters of the losers in a succession struggle were punished instead of being reintegrated into the ruling structure. From this point on, all Mughal emperors would be princes who had little or no experience outside the imperial harem. Clearly, the traditional Timurid mode of handling imperial successions had been corrupted beyond recognition. In the process, the emperor himself had become a virtual puppet of a powerful figure outside the ruling dynasty, in this case Zulfiqar Khan, now the imperial *vazir*.

The relative ease with which Jahandar had been placed on the throne tempted other power brokers to repeat the ploy by advancing the cause of some other prince. The cycle was soon set in motion by two brothers of a well-entrenched clan of Indian Muslims, the Barahas, who had their base in upper India between the Ganges and the Jamuna. These were the so-called Saiyid brothers – Saiyid 'Abd Allah Khan, governor of Allahabad, and Saiyid Husain 'Ali Khan, governor of Bihar. Both men owed their positions to the patronage of Prince 'Azim al-Shan before the latter was killed in the coup that had brought his brother, Jahandar, to the throne. Within months, the ambitious brothers seized on a plan to lift themselves into supreme power by promoting the cause of Farrukh Siyar, the son of their slain patron. In late 1712 a rebel army led by the brothers marched from

Bihar up the Ganges valley towards Agra, with Farrukh Siyar in tow. Up to this point Jahandar had been indolently celebrating his rise to power with his musician courtesan, Lal Kunwar, having left administrative affairs to Zulfiqar Khan. But when news arrived of Farrukh Siyar's advancing army, an alarmed court moved frantically to mount a defence. Since the imperial army would not move without pay – and it had not been paid for nearly a year – the desperate court resorted to breaking its vessels of gold and silver, even stripping gold off the roofs of Delhi's imperial palaces. In the confrontation that followed in early 1713, the rebel army routed the hastily organized and faction-ridden imperial army near Agra. Shortly after reaching Delhi, Farrukh Siyar was crowned and forthwith ordered the execution of both Jahandar and Zulfiqar Khan. 'Abd Allah Khan was duly appointed *vazir* and Husain 'Ali Khan paymaster general, the empire's two highest offices.

Farrukh Siyar's reign (1713–19) had hardly begun, however, before struggles broke out over whether the emperor or his highest ministers would have the final word in fundamental issues of state. Long-submerged tensions over the empire's ethnic identity also rose to the surface. On one side were the Saiyid brothers, whose Baraha clan of Indian Muslims was as native to India as were Jats, Rajputs or Marathas. Towards all such communities the two brothers adopted conciliatory policies, abolishing discriminatory measures that 'Alamgir had imposed, such as the *jizya* tax. On the other side was an equally powerful faction of nobles who claimed a Turkic or Iranian ancestry, had enjoyed Mughal patronage for nearly two centuries, and zealously promoted the dynasty's original Timurid character. So poisonous had these factional struggles become that 'Abd Allah Khan needed an escort of up to 4,000 cavalry when he moved through Delhi's streets to attend daily court as *vazir*. When Ajit Singh, the leader of the Rathors of Jodhpur, refused to take up his appointed position as governor of Sind, Farrukh Siyar sent Husain 'Ali Khan with an army to punish the Rajput *mansabdar*. But the emperor also communicated with Ajit Singh, secretly promising him rewards if he would kill Husain 'Ali Khan. Instead, the two men became allies. Similarly, in the course of the Mughals' long struggle

with the Marathas, Farrukh Siyar sent secret communications to the Maratha leaders urging them to resist Husain 'Ali Khan's overtures to them. But, again, the two sides simply ignored the emperor, making mutually beneficial agreements that Farrukh Siyar refused to ratify, but which the Saiyid brothers and the Marathas honoured anyway.

Matters came to a head in late 1718 when Husain 'Ali Khan arrived in Delhi from the Deccan with 25,000 cavalrymen, nearly half of them Marathas with whom he was allied. In February 1719, after a fiery verbal confrontation in Shahjahanabad's audience hall between the emperor and the other Saiyid brother, the *vazir* 'Abd Allah Khan, the latter seized control of the Red Fort while Farrukh Siyar, guarded by his armed female slaves, was holed up in the harem. In this political impasse, with armed supporters of both sides already fighting in the streets and a restive urban population on the verge of riot, the Saiyid brothers placed Rafi' al-Darjat, an unsuspecting grandson of Bahadur Shah, on the throne. They then sent their own men to the harem, where Farrukh Siyar was dragged out, blinded and later executed. When the tubercular Rafi' al-Darjat died several months later, the Saiyid brothers, now ruling the empire virtually by fiat, placed the deceased emperor's brother, Rafi' al-Daulah, on the throne. Within weeks he, too, died of tuberculosis, at which point the brothers selected another of Bahadur Shah's grandsons, Muhammad Shah, to be emperor.

Within the single year 1719, then, four emperors had occupied the Peacock Throne in rapid succession, a sure sign of structural instability. However, the dictatorial powers that the Saiyid brothers had assumed, which reduced the emperor to an impotent captive, were vigorously opposed by the empire's older, Turko-Iranian nobility, the so-called *khanazad*s. Their opposition focused not only on the outrage of executing a sitting emperor, Farrukh Siyar, but also on the gains that native Indian Muslims had made thanks to the Saiyid brothers' patronage, which they resented. This old-guard opposition coalesced around the governor of Malwa, Chin Qilich Khan – entitled Nizam al-Mulk (d. 1748) – whom Muhammad Shah secretly implored to help release him from his captors, the Saiyid brothers. Help came in mid 1720, when one of the brothers, Husain

'Ali Khan, was assassinated in a plot engineered by old-guard nobles bitterly opposed to the rise of the Baraha clan and to native Indian Muslims generally. The emperor now eagerly joined an effort to complete the coup by getting rid of the other Saiyid brother, 'Abd Allah Khan, which was duly accomplished later that year.

The problems facing Muhammad Shah's long reign (1719–48), however, were hardly resolved by the eclipse of the Saiyid brothers' two-year incumbency. The first two decades of the eighteenth century saw a deepening of the *jagirdari* crisis that had begun late in 'Alamgir's reign. Successive *vazir*s irresponsibly doled out appointments and ranks to their political followers with no certainty that revenue-producing *jagir*s supporting those ranks could be found. Competition among nobles for such *jagir*s inevitably created tensions and factionalism within the nobility, furthering the divide between oldguard Iranian or Turkic nobles and newcomers such as Marathas and Indian Muslims. This posed a political problem. Insufficient land earmarked for *jagir*s also reduced *mansabdar*s' ability to generate the levels of revenue needed to pay their cavalry troops. And since soldiers would not take part in campaigns without regular pay, the *mansabdar*s' cavalry contingents fell below required levels. This posed a military problem. Finally, because an increasing number of *mansabdar*s competed fiercely over a shrinking pool of revenueproducing *jagir*s, nobles with substantial land holdings resisted periodic transfers of their *jagir*s, a hallmark of the system since the days of Akbar. As a result, the *jagir*s of many such nobles became hereditary, undermining the entire idea of the Mughal nobility as a service class without permanent landed estates. This posed a systemic problem.

Further undermining Mughal administration, the regime gradually abandoned the *zabt* system of land taxation, whereby revenue assessments were based on measuring individual fields and periodically evaluating the quality of the land and the type of crops sown. In the early decades of the eighteenth century, such systematic management was increasingly overtaken by the practice of revenue farming, as the court simply sold the right of revenue collection to the highest bidders. After remitting the agreed amount

of land tax to the government, many revenue farmers enriched themselves by squeezing further 'taxes' from cultivators. Not only did the government in this way lose control of its own revenue administration: such practices fuelled the rural discontent that was exploited by local *zamindar*s, who stood between the Mughal state and revenue-producing village communities. These remnants of ancient royalty, long since pushed down in rural society by successive waves of conquerors, stubbornly clung to their traditional claims of local sovereignty, which they typically manifested by building small, fortified strongholds, maintaining armed retainers, adjudicating disputes and claiming a share of the land revenue. Ever since Akbar's reign it had been Mughal policy to transform these stalwart local elites into state revenue collectors or functionaries, and, if such co-option proved impossible, to forcibly clear the landscape of 'the weeds and rubbish of opposition', as Akbar's minister Abu'l-fazl contemptuously called recalcitrant *zamindar*s.<sup>3</sup> By the early eighteenth century, however, Mughal *mansabdar*s had fewer resources to maintain troopers with which to confront unruly *zamindar*s within their *jagir*s. Further tipping the balance of power in favour of the latter was the diffusion of muskets among the population at large, which considerably narrowed the military advantage that the state had previously enjoyed.<sup>4</sup>

The collapse of the Saiyid brothers' rule in 1720 might have seemed a likely moment for the restoration of the old guard of Timurid *khanazad*s, and possibly for a recovery of Mughal power and authority. In early 1722, in fact, the veteran noble Nizam al-Mulk – already the governor of the Deccan, Gujarat and Malwa – was summoned to Delhi and appointed imperial *vazir*. Having served 'Alamgir with unswerving loyalty since 1688, this commander and administrator naturally evaluated Mughal rule of the 1720s in the light of his former master's austere, disciplined administration. He accordingly dismissed Muhammad Shah as a negligent and weakminded stooge completely under the influence of his favourite courtiers. Nizam al-Mulk was also aware of the extent to which longestablished rules of governance had withered, and how deeply the

entry of Marathas and Hindustanis into the nobility had undermined the prestige of his own class of Timurid *khanazad*s. Accordingly, in 1723 he set before the emperor a set of sweeping reforms, which included ending the practice of revenue farming in *khalisa* lands, sacking all nobles ill-fit for the job, redistributing *jagir*s, abolishing *khalisa* lands that had been distributed as *jagir*s, and stamping out the menace of bribery. But Muhammad Shah's favourites at court, fearing the loss of their influence should such proposals be enacted, poisoned the emperor's mind against approving the reforms, which were quietly shelved.<sup>5</sup>

Despairing that the central administration could ever be restored to proper governance, and having been politically marginalized from the court's inner circles since the death of 'Alamgir, Nizam al-Mulk resolved to strike out to the Deccan, the part of India he knew best and where he had the deepest roots. Precipitating his departure was news that his own deputy governor of the Deccan, Mubariz Khan, had in his absence entrenched himself as a practically independent ruler. <sup>6</sup> Departing Shahjahanabad in late 1723 ostensibly for a 'change of air', Nizam al-Mulk reached the Deccan and the next year defeated and killed in battle his rebellious deputy governor, after which Muhammad Shah bestowed on him the exalted title 'Asaf Jah'. The huge block of territory that he carved out, essentially the whole of the Mughal Deccan, would become the state of Hyderabad, effectively launched in 1724 with Mubariz Khan's defeat. After 1763, when its capital was moved from Aurangabad to Hyderabad, Nizam al-Mulk's descendants would be known simply as the Nizams of Hyderabad, and their dynasty as 'Asaf Jahi' – both being titles of the state's founder.

Although he had founded the Mughals' first successor-state on imperial territory, Nizam al-Mulk never formally declared his independence from the Mughals, whom he continued to serve as viceroy of the Deccan. His own coins and those of his successors right up to 1858 continued to bear the emperor's name. By retaining this fictive connection with the regime, the Deccan 'province' offered disaffected northerners the possibility of abandoning Delhi's political

chaos while technically continuing their service with the empire. The strategy appears to have worked. Viewing the Deccan as a robust imperial dependency, thousands of administrators, religious scholars, intellectuals, military men and master craftsmen migrated southwards during Nizam al-Mulk's administration, as did, too, talented members of north India's service castes, such as Kayastha accountants and Punjabi Khatri bankers. These northerners were then added to a political system that, under Nizam al-Mulk, had already absorbed a wide spectrum of the Deccan's constituent communities. After 1728 his relations with the Maratha state stabilized to the extent that he was able to recruit Maratha chieftains, Brahmins and low-level revenue officials into his government.<sup>7</sup> He also assimilated restive and potentially hostile Afghans as fort commanders and allowed more than a dozen Telugu kingdoms (*samasthan*s) to subsist within his borders as tributary states, a policy reminiscent of Akbar's accommodative policy towards Rajput states. Other indigenous groups – such as Tamils, Bhils and Gonds – were similarly brought into Nizam al-Mulk's nascent Hyderabad state.<sup>8</sup>

Like Hyderabad, Bengal also became functionally independent in the 1720s, a process traceable to the career of another of 'Alamgir's officers. Kartalab Khan was a Brahmin slave who had been purchased in his youth, converted, brought up and tutored in the intricacies of clerical practices by 'Alamgir's imperial *diwan*, or chief financial officer. In 1698 Kartalab Khan entered Mughal service as the *diwan* of Hyderabad. Recognizing the young man's exceptional talent for administration, in 1701 'Alamgir appointed him the *diwan* of Bengal, a rich but at the time poorly managed province. His mandate was very clear: enhance its revenue and remit its full share to the central government. Soon after reaching Bengal's provincial capital of Dhaka, Kartalab Khan enacted sweeping reforms. First, he reclassified the delta's *jagir* lands as *khalisa* ones and reassigned dispossessed *jagirdar*s from Bengal to *jagir*s on undeveloped lands in neighbouring Orissa, which from 1703 was also placed under his management. As a result, unlike anywhere else in Mughal India,

Bengal's provincial government absorbed the whole of the delta's agrarian wealth instead of having to share it with *jagirdar*s. Second, he sent surveyors throughout the province to produce accurate figures of local yields. And third, the province's many *zamindar*s were made to pay the full amount of assessed revenue or face imprisonment or torture. Under such pressure, *zamindar*s with smaller holdings were forced to sell their holdings to larger *zamindar*s, with the result that by 1727 just fifteen enormous *zamindari* estates paid nearly half of the province's land revenue. The *diwan*'s reforms also led to the emergence of wealthy banking houses that made enormous profits in interest on loans to *zamindar*s unable to pay their stipulated revenue. In this way, by the 1730s the house of the Jagat Seths had become the largest banking firm in Bengal, if not in all India. In effect, these houses served as guarantors that the provincial government would receive its entire revenue demand.<sup>9</sup>

Kartalab Khan's success in enhancing Bengal's revenue proved a boon for the Mughals' central government at a time when the imperial treasury was severely stressed by 'Alamgir's protracted Deccan campaigns. Beginning in 1702 and continuing for the next several decades, the *diwan* annually remitted ten million rupees from Bengal to the central government, which for some time comprised the only consistently reliable source of revenue for the whole empire. In 1703 he personally attended 'Alamgir's court in the Deccan, where the emperor awarded him the title Murshid Quli Khan in honour of the fiscal officer of the same title who had served Prince Aurangzeb when he governed the Deccan. 'Alamgir also allowed the *diwan* to rename a city in northern Bengal after his new title – Murshidabad, which became the provincial capital in 1704. In 1717 he was made governor of Bengal in addition to *diwan*. Although this violated Mughal protocols prohibiting one person from occupying both offices, Murshid Quli Khan continued to remit Bengal's large annual share of revenue to the central government until his death in 1727. Succeeding him as Bengal governor was his son-in-law, Shuja' al-Din Muhammad Khan (r. 1727–39), initiating a de facto

regional dynasty. Yet Shuja', too, continued to send Bengal's annual revenue to Delhi, in return for which he was allowed to do more or less what he pleased in his province.<sup>10</sup> After his death in 1739, however, authorities in Bengal altogether ceased remitting its substantial revenues to the central government.<sup>11</sup>

In the 1720s and 1730s, still more Mughal provinces acquired de facto independence. In 1722 the emperor appointed Sa'adat 'Ali Khan governor of the central Gangetic province of Awadh, but within just three years he had usurped Delhi's authority by removing imperial *mansabdar*s from their allotted positions and reassigning *jagir*s within the province. The emperor was powerless to enforce his orders or punish the governor. Indeed, Sa'adat 'Ali Khan mobilized local communities around his own banner, entrenching his independent status. Because *jagir*s in Awadh were relatively small, *jagirdar*s lacked substantial power bases, allowing the governor to exert greater authority over them. And, having no sons of his own, he named his nephew and son-in-law Safdar Jung to succeed him as governor of Awadh, thereby launching what amounted to another de facto regional dynasty. He also appointed as his financial officer a Punjabi Khatri who ran the region's finances independently of Delhi's supervision. He, too, passed that office to his son. Further west, the Punjab acquired de facto independence in 1726 when 'Abd al-Samad Khan, who had been appointed governor in 1713, was succeeded by his son.<sup>12</sup>

The ebbing of Mughal power between 1707 and 1750 is seen in other ways, too. Already in Bahadur Shah's reign (1707–12) serious gaps appeared between the assessed revenue and the amount actually collected. Powerful nobles resisted imperial orders to transfer their *jagir*s. Even the Mughal–Rajput alliance showed signs of fraying, as leading Rajput commanders dragged their feet on military campaigns, or abandoned such campaigns altogether. In the reigns of Jahandar and Farrukh Siyar, the practice of farming out revenue collection to the highest bidders, effectively bypassing the official revenue apparatus, became widespread. Jat uprisings in the area west of the Jamuna broke out with increasing frequency and

intensity. Jat chieftains plundered trade caravans that moved along routes between Delhi and Agra, and from there east down the Ganges valley or south towards the Deccan. The most notorious and talented Jat leader, Churaman (d. 1721), briefly carved out his own independent state in the Agra region. The Mughals had to expend considerable resources attempting to suppress, or at least contain, such uprisings occurring so close to their imperial capitals.<sup>13</sup> The state's diminished profile is also reflected in the sharp drop in the treasury at Agra, from ninety million rupees in 1707 to just over ten million in 1720. For several more decades the empire continued to receive revenue from Bengal, the sole remaining prop to imperial finances. But, in 1740, it too ceased. By the time of Muhammad Shah's death in 1748 the empire was totally bankrupt, while its former provinces were either practically independent or managed by outsiders from the south. These were the Marathas.

# MARATHA UPRISINGS

Of the various uprisings that challenged Mughal power and authority in the eighteenth century, that of the Marathas was the most sustained and consequential. From 1682 to 1699 the Maratha state had waged a defensive war against 'Alamgir's aggressive campaigns in the western Deccan. But between 1700 and 1707 Tarabai, governing the kingdom as regent for her infant son, co-ordinated the defence of Maratha strongholds against 'Alamgir's armies while establishing a permanent Maratha presence in parts of Khandesh, Malwa and Gujarat. In those provinces her agents extracted a fourth of the revenue normally paid to the Mughals. This levy, called *chauth*, in effect served as protection money against further Maratha raids, which Mughal authorities were powerless to prevent. But, after 1707, many of Tarabai's former supporters drifted to Shahu, the adult grandson of Shivaji whom 'Alamgir had captured in 1689 and held for eighteen years. After the emperor's death, he was strategically released for the purpose of dividing Maratha loyalties. The ploy succeeded. Maratha chieftains soon split between supporters of

Shahu, the son of Shivaji's first son Sambhaji, and Tarabai, the widow of Shivaji's second son Rajaram.

Meanwhile, Maratha society and culture became progressively more militarized. From the 1640s, Shivaji had recruited into his service *mavali*s, the men inhabiting the jungles and ravines of the Western Ghats. By the 1680s, 'Alamgir was recruiting the same peoples and deploying them against the Maratha state, creating a bidding war between the Mughals and Shivaji's kingdom over access to the western Deccan's military labour market. The intensity of these bidding wars increased with the entry first of Shahu in 1707 as a rival to Tarabai, and then of Nizam al-Mulk in 1712 as a rival to Shahu. By this time warfare had become so lucrative that enterprising men with no ties to the land or prior *deshmukh* status emerged as chiefs (*sardar*) who enlisted villagers into their war bands. Armed villagers would spend half the year (May to October) working their fields and the other half (October to May) on campaign.<sup>14</sup> The militarization of the western Deccan also transformed the meaning of 'Maratha', which from at least the fourteenth century had referred to Marathi-speaking chiefs and their warrior-clients who offered military services to the Bahmani sultanate or its successor states of Bijapur and Ahmadnagar. The word thereby became associated with a martial ethos. Over time, the term acquired social boundaries and embraced distinctive patterns of dress, diet and codes of conduct. By contrast, caste Hindus not integrated into a sultanate's service elite – such as cultivators, artistans or petty merchants – identified themselves as 'Kunbi'. But in the eighteenth century, as villagers appeared in armies mobilized by the Maratha state, they, too, began to see themselves as Marathas, thereby eroding the distinction between Kunbi and Maratha.<sup>15</sup>

Accompanying the militarization of the western plateau was the rise of the office of *peshwa*, a Persian term for 'prime minister' that the Bahmani sultans had introduced in the fourteenth century and was inherited by the Maratha state. In 1713, in an effort to lure a powerful maritime lord from Tarabai's political orbit into his own, Shahu recruited Balaji Vishvanath, a well-networked Chitpavan

Brahmin from the Konkan coast. To strengthen his negotiating hand, Balaji demanded that he be named the *peshwa* of Shahu's court, to which the Maratha king agreed. Balaji then succeeded in drawing the maritime lord to Shahu's camp, initiating a progressive decline of Tarabai's influence in Maratha politics. The office of *peshwa* soon swelled into the Peshwas – that is, a line of hereditary Brahmin rulers whose authority would ultimately displace that of the Maratha king himself.

At the same time, Brahmins entered the Maratha state's political economy at all levels.<sup>16</sup> Because their troops were paid in cash, *sardar*s had to negotiate loans with bankers at the beginning of each campaign season. And since interest rates on such loans depended on the fiscal stability of the area under a given chief's control, Brahmin accountants (*kulkarni*s, *deshpande*s) would evaluate the fiscal worth of the chief's lands, and hence his creditworthiness. Banking and credit thus provided the hinge by which Brahmins acquired political influence, whether as village moneylenders advancing cash to chiefs and headmen, or as great banking firms financing the Maratha government's large-scale campaigns in Mughal north India.<sup>17</sup> The translation of Brahmins' financial power into political power began with Balaji Vishvanath's appointment as *peshwa* in 1713 and continued as his fellow Chitpavan Brahmins migrated from their native Konkan coast up to the plateau, where they served as tax-collectors, administrators and especially as bankers loaning Shahu money to raise his armies. Upon Balaji's death in 1720, Shahu named Balaji's son Baji Rao (r. 1720–40) as his successor, creating in effect a dynasty of hereditary Brahmin Peshwas.

From 1713 on, Maratha armies ranged ever deeper into the older imperial provinces to the north. Typically filling the vacuum left by the Mughals' decaying local administration, these raids were manned by Maratha–Kunbi peasant-soldiers, directed by the Peshwas and financed by Brahmin financial credit and the levy of *chauth*. After 1735, their armies began to remain in north India through the monsoon season without returning to Maharashtra. But this hindered

agricultural operations in the Maratha heartland, since so many soldiers were cultivators. Efforts to compensate by mobilizing landless peasants to cultivate state lands and wastelands only reduced government revenues, since landless peasants paid few or no land taxes.<sup>18</sup> On the other hand, attempts to bring peasantsoldiers back to Maharashtra for agricultural purposes left the armies in the north strapped for manpower. To meet the deficit, the government enlisted non-Maratha mercenaries, including Pashtun Afghans, Arabs and north Indians.<sup>19</sup> This further diluted the character of 'Maratha' armies, a process that had already begun with the incorporation of Kunbi villagers in the Peshwas' infantries.

The growth of Maratha power in north India proceeded by stages. In 1716 Balaji audaciously asked Farrukh Siyar to grant him the right to collect *chauth* everywhere south of the Narmada, proposing in effect a dual government in which Marathas and Mughals would share the collection of revenue. The emperor angrily rejected the proposal. But in 1719, after Farrukh Siyar was overthrown by the Saiyid brothers, the latter, with whom the Peshwa was then allied, consented to the deal. This agreement served as a charter for subsequent Maratha claims to the Deccan's revenues, and as a blueprint for access to the revenues of older Mughal provinces in the north. Under Baji Rao, Maratha raids into Malwa became more regular and more lucrative, culminating in 1728 when the Peshwa defeated Nizam al-Mulk just thirty-two kilometres west of the latter's capital of Aurangabad. From there he continued marching further north to Ujjain, defeating its Mughal defenders. This threw all of western Malwa open to Maratha plundering. After these reverses, Nizam al-Mulk granted the Peshwa what Delhi had already granted the Maratha leader, namely the latter's right to collect *chauth* throughout the Deccan. By the 1730s Baji Rao was raising ever larger armies and sending them further afield, through Malwa both north into Rajasthan and east into the Gangetic plain. By 1737 his armies managed to drive north as far as Delhi itself. Neither Muhammad Shah's decaying government in Delhi nor Nizam al-Mulk's in Aurangabad could halt the Peshwa. By January 1739

Nizam al-Mulk had acknowledged the Marathas' complete sovereignty in Malwa and in all lands between the Narmada and the Chambal River, which runs a mere forty-five kilometres south of Agra.

Later that year the Persian warlord Nadir Shah marched through the Khyber Pass with 150,000 cavalry, defeated a much larger Mughal army and sacked a supine, defenceless Delhi. Like Timur more than three centuries earlier, he chose not to remain in India, returning to Iran with caravans laden with looted gold, silver and jewellery worth 1.5 million rupees, including the famed Koh-i-Noor, and, not least, Shah Jahan's priceless Peacock Throne. With such celebrated symbols of imperial glory for ever stripped from Indian soil, the Marathas were suddenly awakened to the reality that the Mughals were not, in fact, their enemy. Rather, they now saw the house of Babur as the key symbol of Indian sovereignty, to be defended from foreign invaders at all costs. To this end, Baji Rao proposed that all the powers of north India join a confederation to protect India's Timurid dynasty, making the Peshwa almost resemble a proto-nationalist figure. For several decades, a cornerstone of Maratha policy was to pose as the Mughals' truest defenders, at least at the imperial level.

At the grass-roots level, however, the Peshwa's *sardar*s continued to chip away at Mughal sovereignty. In older provinces such as Malwa, Khandesh or Gujarat, independent bands of up to 5,000 light cavalry would raid and plunder the countryside, avoiding pitched battles with imperial armies.<sup>20</sup> Mughal authorities in these provinces might still control major fortified urban centres, but they were no longer drawing revenue from their rural hinterlands. The transition from Mughal to Maratha authority between the 1730s and 1750s was therefore barely perceptible, not only because it occurred so gradually, but also because the Marathas continued to use Mughal administrative procedures and practices, mitigating a sense of a political rupture.<sup>21</sup> Yet Maratha rule was patchy and irregular across much of central India in those decades, some regions being fully administered by the Peshwa's men and others only thinly

administered, and populated by recalcitrant *zamindar*s who managed to defy Maratha authority from behind walled strongholds.

Under Baji Rao's son Nana Saheb (r. 1740–61), Maratha conquests briefly encompassed almost all of north India. These included six devastating raids on Bengal between 1741 and 1751. But, by the late 1750s, the Marathas had become more than simply the guarantors of Mughal authority. As their strategic objective shifted from defending their mountainous homeland to plundering and then governing north India's wide plains, they also adopted Mughal military culture. In the days of Shivaji, Maratha forces had consisted of small, mobile bands of swift cavalry and lightly armed infantry, appropriate for the sort of guerrilla warfare that Malik Ambar had pioneered in the Ahmadnagar sultanate's final decades. By contrast, the great Maratha armies of the 1740s and 1750s, which numbered up to 40,000 mainly uniformed infantry, lumbered across the land like moving cities, moving no faster than the bullocks that dragged their long trains of baggage and heavy artillery. By midcentury, too, the Maratha ruling elite, owing to its prolonged exposure to north India's ways, had acquired a taste for the refinements of Mughal culture. This in turn created a demand in urban Maharashtra for Kashmiri shawls, Bengali silks, ivory craft, metalwork in silver, copper and brass and so on, while administrators in the Maratha capital in Satara, and after 1750 in Pune, patronized north Indian styles of painting and music.<sup>22</sup>

Because they had become so deeply enmeshed in north Indian affairs, it was Maratha generals who in 1759 negotiated with Ahmad Shah Abdali, an Afghan warlord whose army had entered the Punjab and asserted Afghan territorial claims to the province. With a major showdown between the Marathas and Afghans in the air, in December the next year the Peshwa, Nana Saheb, began moving his own army northwards, aiming to join the main Maratha force then camped at Panipat, the historic battlefield north of Delhi. But he never got there. In mid January 1761, an estimated 50,000 Marathas were slaughtered at Panipat in one of the greatest military debacles in Indian history. For the Peshwa personally, the disaster

represented a bitter indictment of decades of his and his predecessors' forward policy in north India. Upon hearing the news while still en route to join the battle, the Peshwa turned round and headed back to Pune, a disillusioned and broken man. Within six months he was dead. The entire Maratha project north of Maharasthra had become either stalled or reversed.

## SIKH UPRISINGS

The other formidable challenge to Mughal authority in the eighteenth century was mounted by the Sikhs. Unlike the Marathas, who contested Mughal power throughout India, the Sikh rebellion was confined to the Punjab. And whereas the Marathas initially resisted the Mughals but ended up defending the crippled empire, with the Sikhs it was the reverse. The movement launched by Guru Nanak had emerged in the sixteenth century within the matrix of the Mughal imperium, with which it was once on generally good terms. But over time relations between the two grew increasingly hostile. How and why, then, did the Sikhs' militantly anti-Mughal posture incubate and grow?

We have seen that following Jahangir's execution of Guru Arjun, the latter's son and successor, Guru Hargobind, adopted a distinctly martial profile. Claiming both temporal and spiritual authority over the Sikh community, he built a fort at Amritsar, where he also established a court and 'immortal throne' (Akal Takht). Suspicious of others adopting the trappings of sovereignty within his domain, Jahangir had him imprisoned for twelve years. Even while relations with the Mughals continued to deteriorate, the Sikhs faced formidable internal threats, as collateral descendants of the fourth guru fiercely contested successions to that office. Guru Hargobind's authority was challenged by his uncle, whose own son and later his grandson set themselves up as an alternative line of gurus. Owing to such internal challenges, combined with periodic skirmishes with Mughal forces, Guru Hargobind withdrew from Amritsar and established his court in the Himalayan foothills in the Siwalik range to the north-east, beyond directly administered Mughal territory. There, among the hill rajas,

the last five of the ten Sikh gurus spent most of their time. Yet relations with the Mughals continued to worsen. In 1675, imperial authorities interpreted the activities of the ninth guru, Tej Bahadur (G. 1664–75), as threatening and had him arrested and executed.<sup>23</sup>

Although residence in the hills had minimized the gurus' direct contact with Mughal authorities, it also cut them off from the bulk of the growing Sikh community, which dwelt on the plains of the eastern Punjab. As a result, dissenting factions outside the lineage of the tenth guru, Gobind (G. 1675–1708), were able to take control of Amritsar and the sacred precincts of the Golden Temple. What is more, many of his *masand*s – the institutional link between the gurus and the bulk of their followers – were appropriating power for themselves, appointing their own deputies for collecting offerings from the faithful, following rival claimants to the guruship, and interfering in succession struggles. In these circumstances, Guru Gobind concluded that radical reforms were needed to reassert his sole authority over the Sikh community and to end the divisive succession disputes.

His solution was dramatic. In 1699 he declared that the lineage of gurus would end with himself, thereby resolving the issue of any future succession struggles, and that his spiritual authority would henceforth be invested in a new, self-governing corporate body, the Khalsa, sworn by rites of initiation and dedicated to undertaking certain reforms. Initiates would leave their hair and beards unshorn, disavow previous caste identities, renounce the use of tobacco, cease patronizing *masand*s, collectivize the community's material resources and visit the guru bearing arms. Guru Gobind took this drastic initiative in order to resist Rajput incursions into Sikh domains, halt dissenting groups from encroaching on the Sikh community, and eliminate the many *masand*s that stood between the guru and the larger Sikh community. <sup>24</sup> The importance of the last concern is seen in the very name Khalsa. In Mughal usage, the familiar category *khalisa* – an administrative term derived from the Arabic *khalis* meaning 'pure' or 'unmediated' – denoted land whose wealth flowed directly to the state, unmediated by *jagirdar*s. Similarly,

Guru Gobind understood the Khalsa as a family of faith whose loyalty was unmediated by *masand*s or other human agents, such as rival claimants to the guruship.

The Mughal government's position towards these developments was generally benign but wary. In 1689 Guru Gobind had established himself in Anandpur, in the Siwalik range seventy kilometres north-east of Ludhiana. Ten years later, immediately after the Khalsa was formed, substantial numbers of volunteers, arms and funds began pouring into the region. In response, 'Alamgir ordered local officials to leave the guru alone as long as he adopted a modest lifestyle like other spiritual mendicants, but to make him submit and pay taxes if he imitated kingly ways.<sup>25</sup> At that time, the guru's most immediate adversaries were not Mughal authorities but neighbouring hill rajas who presided over hierarchically ordered societies and Brahmin-dominated royal courts that clashed with the Sikhs' egalitarian social vision and guru institution. Moreover, to accommodate the host of followers who had arrived from the plains, the Sikhs at Anandpur had been raiding richer, nearby villages for supplies. This, in turn, angered the hill rajas, who in 1704 (or 1705) subjected Anandpur to a protracted siege.<sup>26</sup> The rajas also appealed to the Mughals to intervene in the conflict.<sup>27</sup>

As a consequence of the siege, Guru Gobind and his followers were ultimately forced to abandon the town and its forts. But in the confusion that followed, Mughal authorities captured and killed the guru's two youngest sons, notwithstanding the government's sworn promise to ensure the Sikhs' safe passage from Anandpur. The aggrieved guru then appealed directly to 'Alamgir for redress, using an extraordinary medium – a long Persian poem in which he defiantly censured the Mughals for their perfidy. He also demanded a personal meeting with the emperor to obtain justice and, more generally, to sort out Sikh–Mughal relations.<sup>28</sup> 'Alamgir agreed and ordered his officials in the Punjab to arrange for the guru's safe passage to his court in the Deccan. After Guru Gobind left the Punjab, however, news arrived that in March 1707 'Alamgir had died. But the guru proceeded anyway, meeting Bahadur Shah in Delhi as

he was consolidating his power there, and then accompanying the new emperor to the Deccan. There, in 1708, the guru himself died, leaving the community momentarily leaderless so soon after the Khalsa institution had been launched.<sup>29</sup>

In this fluid atmosphere, before the idea of shared Sikh governance had had time to take root, in 1709 a mysterious, charismatic figure named Banda Bahadur appeared on the scene claiming to be the guru's chosen representative and promising to lead the still-fractured Sikh community into glory. His followers, consisting mainly of Khalsa Sikhs drawn from small *zamindar*s and Jat farmers of rural east Punjab, grew tenfold within a year or so, from 4,000 to 40,000.<sup>30</sup> For the next six years, until 1715 when he was captured by Mughal authorities, this quasi-millennial figure led his supporters against wealthy cities, plundering and gathering strength. The rebellion initially targeted the prosperous Mughal city of Sirhind in south-eastern Punjab, the base of the imperial officer who had betrayed Guru Gobind, killing members of his family. The movement thus had a specifically anti-Mughal basis from the start. It then spread to larger Mughal centres, notably Lahore, disrupting the functioning of provincial government generally. Although Bahadur Shah sent armies to suppress the revolt shortly after it had begun, further imperial energies were sapped with that emperor's death in 1712, followed by three years of factional turmoil in Delhi during the reign of Jahandar and the coup that brought Farrukh Siyar to power.

Banda's successes also built on a century of material prosperity in the Punjab, as lineages of Jat farmers opened up new tracts for settlement and cultivation. On the one hand, this spurt in rural prosperity enabled many villagers to afford more and better weapons with which to participate in the Punjab's growing military labour market. On the other hand, the establishment of the Khalsa presented an attractive alternative to participation in that market. Initiation into the community conferred on every male Sikh the prestigious name 'Singh', a title hitherto claimed only by aristocratic Rajputs, who were rulers or landholders, or in some cases by Khatris, the dominant commercial class.<sup>31</sup> For prosperous Jat

agriculturalists, then, becoming not just Sikhs but members of the Khalsa constituted a rise in social status commensurate with the greater prosperity that they and the Punjab generally were experiencing. Shunning the idea of fighting for money as opposed to fighting for community and religion, Khalsa Sikhs joined Banda Bahadur's military movement rather than participate in the cashdriven military labour market.

All this lent socio-religious force to Banda's rebellion, which inflicted damaging attacks on Mughal centres across the Punjab, especially in the east, where most of Banda's supporters were rural Jats recently absorbed into the Khalsa. But the rebellion cannot be reduced to neat binaries, such as Sikhs versus Muslims, or peasants versus feudal landholders. Banda's most proximate adversaries were hostile neighbours such as the Ranghar Rajputs, the Mein Rajputs and the Qasur Afghans, just as Guru Gobind's immediate adversaries at Anandpur had been neighbouring hill rajas. Because *zamindar*s varied enormously in the amount of land they controlled, they never formed a single class. As a result, they too were found on both sides of the rebellion. The uprising also exposed rifts within the Sikh community, most importantly between Khatris – the caste to which Guru Nanak and subsequent gurus had belonged – and Khalsa Sikhs, who never comprised more than a tenth of the total community. Many Khatri Sikhs were big cloth and textile merchants who opposed the disruptions to business caused by Banda's plundering raids. Others were revenue farmers who, being closely tied to the imperial administrative system, supported Mughal efforts to suppress the rebellion. Still others held high *mansab*s in Mughal officialdom, appearing in imperial literary works as notables or even nobles. They also served as agents or clerks for imperial *jagirdar*s, in which capacity they maintained their own aristocratic establishments, including elephants, workshops and servants. Such Khatri Sikhs, too, were inclined to defend the existing order. <sup>32</sup> Nor did Banda's efforts to project his movement as a holy war (*dharma yudha*) find favour among Hindus, even those who had their own grievances against the Mughals.<sup>33</sup> In short, Banda's fiercely anti-Mughal

rebellion elicited anything but a unified response across Punjabi society.

But this soon changed. When the Mughals finally managed to crush the uprising, they did so harshly, culminating in 1716 with the execution of Banda and more than 700 of his followers in Delhi. This public episode was spectacularly brutal: the rebel leader was first made to kill his own son and then was torn to pieces.<sup>34</sup> What provoked the Mughals' violent suppression of the movement was not just its seizure of de facto control of virtually all the Punjab east of Lahore. Equally serious was Banda's minting of his own coins – a sign of independent sovereignty – and establishing his own calendar, vaguely projecting the rebel as a millennial figure.<sup>35</sup> Neither of these could be tolerated by the Mughal state: the former challenged the regime's claims to sole sovereignty in the Punjab, and the latter its monopoly of sacred kingship.

The rebellion had far-reaching consequences. With the abandonment of the guru's court in the Himalayan foothills, Amritsar and the Golden Temple's sacred precincts once again became the primary locus of the Sikhs' religious and political aspirations. Second, as the Mughals' harsh suppression of the revolt polarized the Punjab's population between supporters of the regime and those of the Khalsa Sikhs, the latter grew more militant and more implacably opposed to the state. Ever since Banda's rebellion, and in a sense building on it, Khalsa Sikhs had begun organizing themselves into war bands called *misal*s, which sought to replace Mughal sovereign territory with their own. Using light cavalry and guerrilla tactics not unlike those of the Marathas in the early days of Shivaji or Tarabai, these bands and their *sardar*s filled the political and military vacuum created by the ebbing of Mughal authority throughout the central, eastern and southern Punjab. By the middle of the century, twelve such bands controlled those regions. By that time, there had also appeared within the Sikh community a genre of texts called *rahit-nama*s, which drew clear lines between Sikhs and other religious communities, often demonizing Muslims. On the other hand, once individual *misal* chiefs acquired control of territory, the

practical business of governance compelled them to cut deals with Afghans, Marathas or even Mughals, ignoring the advice of the *rahitnama*s. Depending on the political realities of the moment, *misal* chiefs might join the campaigns of any of those groups, or hire Muslims in their own service just as the Mughals hired Sikhs in theirs.<sup>36</sup>

It was overland invasions from the west, however, that destroyed what little remained of Mughal power in the Punjab. Nadir Shah's 1739 raid on north India and sacking of Delhi clearly exposed the Mughals' increasingly feeble condition under Muhammad Shah.<sup>37</sup> Then in 1748 Ahmad Shah Abdali, the powerful Afghan warlord, made the first of seventeen annual raids on north India. Although the Mughals repulsed the first of these, just four years later matters had deteriorated such that the Mughal governor of the Punjab agreed to send his land revenue to Ahmad Shah rather than to Delhi. This effectively removed the province administratively from the Mughal empire. As discussed above, in 1761 the Afghan warlord crushed an immense Maratha army at the Third Battle of Panipat, thereby ending the Marathas' bid to control the Punjab. Within six years of that battle, with the Afghans in no position to collect revenue in the province, a loose confederation of Sikh *misal*s gained control over the greater part of the Punjab plains. By this time, though, the Mughals had sunk to little more than onlookers from the political sidelines.

### EMERGING IDENTITIES: MUSLIMS IN BENGAL AND PUNJAB

At the very time that the Mughal empire's central institutions had reached an advanced state of decay, India's largest Muslim community was emerging along the empire's eastern frontier. 38 Bengali Muslims, most of whom inhabit present-day Bangladesh, comprise the world's second-largest ethnic community of Muslims. Their appearance was actually one dimension of a larger transformation of the region's politics and economy, which coincided with the delta's shifting geomorphology. The story of the growth Bengal's Muslim population therefore begins with the land itself.

By depositing rich silt that made possible the cultivation of wet rice, Bengal's many rivers had for centuries provided the material basis of the delta's society and culture. But owing to the land's flat surface, those slow-moving rivers never remained fixed in place. Upon silting up their channels, they repeatedly jumped their own banks and gravitated ever eastwards between the twelfth and eighteenth centuries (see Maps 5, 7 and 8). In the 1570s the Ganges had already divided into two branches in present-day Malda District, one branch flowing south towards Satgaon (near Kolkata) and the other flowing east towards Sonargaon (near Dhaka). By 1666 the former branch had become altogether unnavigable.<sup>39</sup> Having abandoned its former channels in western and southern Bengal, the Ganges system then linked up with the Padma and other rivers, cutting through the heart of the eastern delta in present-day Bangladesh. These riverine movements carried the centre of Bengali civilization eastwards, as formerly thriving population centres in the western delta became moribund when the rivers abandoned them. Meanwhile, pioneers in the delta's more ecologically active eastern regions cut virgin forests, throwing open a widening zone for field agriculture.40 Deposited over an expanding area of the eastern delta during annual flooding, greater volumes of silt permitted intensified cultivation along the larger rivers where rice cultivation had already been established, and an extension of cultivation into those parts of the interior not already brought under the plough. As a result, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Bengal achieved remarkable levels of rice production: by the 1630s more than 100 vessels laden with rice were embarking annually from Bengal, bound for ports around the Bay of Bengal as far east as Sumatra.<sup>41</sup>

Bengal's riverine changes and subsequent agricultural boom coincided not only with the rise of Mughal power in the province, but also with the growth in overland and maritime trade that linked Bengal ever more tightly to the world economy. In the last two decades of the sixteenth century, while Mughal troops pushed into the heart of the active delta and established their provincial headquarters in Dhaka, the Portuguese built the port of Hooghly

adjacent to modern Kolkata, expanded their community in Chittagong and planted mercantile colonies in and around Dhaka. In the early seventeenth century the Dutch and English trading companies gradually replaced the over-extended Portuguese as the dominant European merchants in Bengal's port cities, and by the end of that century the export of raw silk and cotton textiles had grown so rapidly that Bengal emerged as Europe's single most important supplier of goods in all Asia.<sup>42</sup> Stimulating this manufacturing boom were substantial quantities of silver that poured into the province from overseas. In the 1550s the Portuguese were shipping so much treasure into Bengal that the value of silver currency in Goa actually fluctuated with their sailing seasons to Bengal and Malacca.<sup>43</sup> Between 1709 and 1717 the Dutch and English East India companies together shipped into Bengal cargoes averaging 4.15 million rupees in value annually, 85 per cent of which was silver. <sup>44</sup> Advanced to Bengali agents, merchants or weavers, this treasure was quickly absorbed into the regional economy, adding considerably to the stocks of rupee coinage already in circulation.<sup>45</sup> Yet Bengal experienced no price inflation in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, since the production of agricultural and manufactured goods, together with the population base, grew at levels high enough to absorb the expanding money supply created by the influx of foreign silver. Newly minted silver percolated freely throughout Bengali society, penetrating ever lower levels and facilitating the kinds of land transfers and cash advances that typically accompany an expanding agrarian frontier.

These geographical, political and economic changes in eastern Bengal coincided in time and place with the earliest recorded appearance of a Bengali Muslim peasantry. In 1567 a Venetian traveller noted that the entire population of Sandwip, a large island in Bengal's south-eastern corner opposite Chittagong, was Muslim, and in 1599 a Jesuit missionary, touring the rural districts near Narayanganj in south-eastern Dhaka District, noted that 'the people are nearly all Mahometans'.<sup>46</sup> In 1638, the Mughal governor of Bengal mentioned large Muslim communities inhabiting eastern

Bengal's Noakhali coast.<sup>47</sup> Significantly, prior to the advent of Mughal rule in the delta, the masses of eastern Bengal were not firmly integrated into a Hindu socio-religious order. <sup>48</sup> This suggests that, when the growth of Islam did occur in this region, its population did not migrate from a Hindu to a Muslim identity. Rather, the religious culture of the fishing, hunting and slash-and-burn farming communities of pre-Muslim eastern Bengal was saturated with local forest cults that focused especially on female deities such as Manasa or Chandi. On the other hand, the western portion of the delta, where Islam made little headway, was at the time of the Mughal conquest already populated by settled, wet-rice-cultivating communities of hierarchically ordered Hindu castes.<sup>49</sup>

From at least the sixteenth century, the arduous business of forest-clearing and land reclamation in the eastern delta was associated with the activities of enterprising men who were popularly – and often retroactively – identified as holy men. In local memory, some of these men swelled into vivid, mythico-historical figures whose lives served as metaphors for the expansion of both religion and agriculture. They endured precisely because, in collective memory, their careers captured and telescoped a complex historical socio-religious process whereby a land originally forested and non-Muslim became arable and mainly Muslim. A Bengali poem composed around 1590 associates Muslim pioneers with the clearing of forests and the establishment of local markets.<sup>50</sup> And a late-sixteenth-century Bengali biography of the Prophet Muhammad and other prophets of Islam, the *Nabi-Bangsa*, characterizes the patriarch Abraham as a man who, born and brought up in a forest, travelled to Palestine, where he attracted tribes from nearby lands, mobilized local labour to cut down the forest and built a holy place – Jerusalem's Temple – for offering prayers to God.<sup>51</sup> In this way, the main themes of Abraham's life as recorded in this epic precisely mirrored the careers of the hundreds of pioneers who, during the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, mobilized local clients in the Bengali countryside for just such activities.

This literary evidence corroborates data found in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Mughal documents referring to pioneers who opened up virgin forest for rice cultivation by mobilizing labour, advancing capital and clearing the land's thick forests prior to launching rice-cultivation operations. From a local *zamindar* who might have had claims to the land, these entrepreneurs acquired authorization for clearing the forest, and from mainly Hindu bankers or moneylenders they obtained finances with which to pay their labour force. The pioneers then organized local labourers to clear and ultimately cultivate the land, which Mughal authorities subsequently declared tax-free.

Notably, it was never the state's intention to promote a Muslim society on the Bengal frontier. Rather, by outsourcing community and economic development to enterprising pioneers, whether Hindu or Muslim, government officials endeavoured to secure a loyal and stable society on an otherwise unruly frontier, while also expanding the amount of arable land within their domain. As Mughal revenue documents stipulate, all pioneers regardless of their religious identity were required to 'assiduously pray for the survival of the powerful state'. Loyalty, stability and agrarian productivity, not religious affiliation, were the state's overriding concerns. As a condition for receiving a grant that authorized the development of a tax-free tract of forest, a Hindu pioneer had to build a temple and a Muslim pioneer had to build a mosque, either of which would have provided a measure of institutional focus and local stability. But because most pioneers were Muslims, more mosques appeared in the eastern delta than temples. Consequently, more indigenous peoples were exposed to Muslim than to Hindu religious culture.

As a result of these measures, the primitive mosques of bamboo and thatching built by Muslim pioneers constituted the earliest Muslim institutions in what had hitherto been dense, thinly populated forests. Shortly after the Mughals annexed the heavily forested Chittagong region in 1666, mosques and shrines began proliferating throughout the area, as provincial officers issued written orders (*sanad*s) to local functionaries ordering them to transfer jungle lands from the royal domain – or from *zamindar*s claiming proprietary

rights – to enterprising pioneers. These tax-free grants set in motion far-reaching socio-economic processes: forest lands became rice fields, while local hunters, fisherfolk or slash-and-burn farmers became wet-rice-cultivating communities. They also became clients of the pioneers who had opened up particular tracts of land, and since these grants were renewable, subsequent generations were clients of the descendants of those pioneers. Over time, many of the original pioneers came to be venerated as Muslim holy men, or even as spiritually powerful Sufi shaikhs, and their grave sites as shrines. This is why in Bengal, unlike elsewhere in India, local saints are often associated with both the propagation of Islam and the introduction of wet-rice agriculture.

The growth of Muslim communities along the Bengal frontier was thus a by-product of interconnected political, economic and ultimately geomorphological processes. Having assisted the grantee in clearing the forests, the latter's dependants continued to serve the institution the grantee had established by cultivating the lands included in the grant. Each new mosque in the forest thus became the nucleus for a new community of Muslim cultivators. Even while the Mughals' imperial centre was sinking into irreversible decay, along the state's peripheries the government's bureaucratic machinery continued to grind forwards out of sheer inertia of motion, issuing land grants that allowed enterprising pioneers to clear jungle land and establish permanent wet-rice cultivation. Indigenous peoples in this way became cultivators of the land, over time acquiring the religious identity associated with those original pioneers and their humble mosques.

A similar combination of peasantization and Islamization occurred in the western Punjab, a process that began in the thirteenth century but was not complete until the eighteenth. Like eastern Bengal, western Punjab had for centuries lain on the margins of expansive, Delhi-based empires. And like the indigenous communities of eastern Bengal, Jat pastoralists in the western Punjab had been only partially incorporated into a Hindu socio-religious world at the time of their earliest contact with Muslims. Finally, as in eastern Bengal, the growth of Islam in the western Punjab occurred in tandem with a

transition to settled agriculture – specifically, as Jat clans began to abandon full-time pastoralism and take up settled wheat-farming. However, whereas Islamization in eastern Bengal had been launched and sustained by hundreds of humble, thatched mosques established by forest-clearing developers, in the Punjab this role was played by large, state-supported shrine complexes that had been built over the grave sites of renowned Sufi shaikhs. Located along the banks of the southern and western Punjab's rivers – the Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej – these shrines were socio-cultural magnets, attracting large numbers of Jat communities for whom they provided a range of socio-economic and religious services. The spiritual power (*baraka*) of eminent Sufi shaikhs buried at these shrines was, and is, widely believed to adhere to the physical shrines and their immediate precincts. Like many other such shrines in western Punjab, that of Shaikh Farid al-Din Ganj-i Shakar, popularly known as Baba Farid, attracted rural folk from across the region seeking the blessings and intercession of a saint believed capable of mediating the human and divine worlds. Located in Pakpattan by the banks of the Sutlej River, Baba Farid's shrine attracted the patronage of political actors at the highest levels. Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq built an imposing structure over the shaikh's grave site and granted endowments for the upkeep of his shrine and its large public kitchen. Sultan Firuz Tughluq conferred robes of honour on the saint's descendants and confirmed their land holdings. Ibn Battuta, Timur and Akbar all paid their respects to the shrine.

The predominant clientele of the Punjab's great shrines, however, were Jat communities who by the eleventh century had migrated from Sind up the Indus valley into the southern Punjab, where they were described as 'low Sudra' cattle-owners. By the thirteenth century they were reported in the western Punjab, and by the late sixteenth they had taken up settled agriculture. By that time the charismatic authority of major shrines had long been preserved and nurtured by the descendants of their respective founders. These men not only supervised and led the rituals associated with the shrines; they also patronized the chiefs of Jat clans, just as they themselves were patronized by Mughal authorities. In Pakpattan, Jat

chiefs gave their daughters in marriage to the sons of the leader of Baba Farid's shrine, whereas the leader's own daughters were kept within the extended family, thereby replicating the same sort of marital practices and alliances that the Mughals had established with politically subordinate Rajput clans. As Jat clans entered into political, religious and marital relations with shrines such as that of Baba Farid, the names they gave their children reveal a gradual adoption of an Islamic identity. As early as the fifteenth century, Muslim names began to appear among Jat tribes associated with Baba Farid's shrine, but they did not become dominant among those tribes until the early eighteenth, indicating a very slow and apparently unconscious process of Islamization.<sup>52</sup>

Quite significantly, these socio-religious movements in eastern Bengal and western Punjab created the two largest Muslim communities in pre-British India, which would ultimately comprise the core of two post-British states: Bangladesh and Pakistan. The two communities shared a similar historical trajectory in that, in both, the evolution of an Islamic religious identity was associated with a transition to sedentary agrarian life among communities only lightly touched by Hindu culture. These were not, however, the only instances in which changes in socio-economic status led to new cultural identities. We have seen that rising social status resulting from participation in India's military labour market also drove new cultural identities, as in the case of Kunbi farmers of Maharashtra becoming Marathas, Gujarati pastoralists becoming Rajputs, or Jats of eastern Punjab becoming Sikhs. All these cases indicate how cultural identities were never fixed or immutable, but contingent upon, and shaped by, larger processes specific to particular historical contexts.

### EARLY MODERN GLOBALIZATION

Partly responsible for these changes in cultural identity were powerful, interconnected transregional forces. These included the movement of pastoral communities into agrarian zones, the expanding geographical and social reach of cash, and the growing

integration of India's economy and society with wider networks of commerce. Such forces were part of a quickened, worldwide exchange of ideas, commodities, technologies, peoples, diseases and cultural traditions that transformed all participants, not least the Mughal empire.

In early December 1572, during his first attempt at conquering Gujarat, Akbar visited the ancient seaport of Cambay, at the time the region's principal window on the outside world. Upon being welcomed at a pleasant spot by a delegation of foreign merchants – Turks from the Ottoman world, Persians from Safavid Iran, possibly some Portuguese – the emperor and a select body of men embarked on a ship. This brief excursion out on the water had no military or commercial purpose. It was made, records Abu'l-fazl, merely 'to witness the spectacle of the ocean'.<sup>53</sup> Never before had any ruler in Akbar's direct line of descent, going back to Timur himself, seen the ocean. But from this moment on, the Mughals would learn what peoples in coastal India had long known: that the sea was a source of wealth and power. Appropriating existing ports or establishing new ones, owning ships and investing in trade would open up to the Mughals a much wider world than the one they had previously known. In a larger sense, Akbar's direct encounter with the open sea symbolized the joining of the land-based Mughal imperium with transoceanic commercial networks. To obtain direct access to the sources of spices, pepper and textiles, fifteenth-century Portuguese navigators had already pioneered an all-maritime route from the North Atlantic Ocean to India, where they established a series of fortified trading enclaves along the coasts of the peninsula, Gujarat and Bengal.

Although Portuguese strategists imagined that they had 'conquered' large parts of the Indian Ocean world, they were actually accommodating themselves to a dense web of maritime commerce that had been built up over many centuries by a mix of seafaring peoples – Arabs, Gujaratis, Malays, Iranians, Tamils, Swahilis, Chinese. Yet, soon after Vasco da Gama lowered anchor at Calicut in 1498, and especially after the Estado da India's grand strategist

Afonso d'Albuquerque established a permanent, colonial enclave at Goa in 1510, the Portuguese enterprise introduced new commodities, ideas and technologies to India. A vigorous Catholic mission in Goa carried religious ideas to Akbar's court in Agra. New crops that the Portuguese brought from America – for example potatoes, maize, chillies, squash and tomatoes – utterly transformed the Indian diet. Europe's direct maritime connection with India also facilitated technological transfers, as when Deccani engineers applied the idea of swivel cannon, which the Portuguese had mounted on their ships' gunwales, to the massive cannon that were then positioned atop the Deccan's hill forts.

By the dawn of the seventeenth century, other European enterprises had reached the Indian Ocean: the Dutch East India Company, founded in 1602, and its smaller counterpart, the English East India Company, founded in 1600. Unlike Portugal's Estado da India – a royal endeavour in which soldiers, merchants and clergy all worked for the king – these were joint stock companies launched by independent merchants in Amsterdam and London. Although they enjoyed the support of their respective governments, the companies were primarily responsible to their investors. Private merchants working for them would pool their resources, buy and equip ships and launch overseas 'ventures' in which stockholders shared profits or losses – an early instance of global capitalism. These two north European operations, followed somewhat later by Danish (1616) and French (1664) overseas trading companies, established a number of trading posts that paralleled the network of Portuguese enclaves already scattered around the Indian Ocean rim. By 1700 European companies were importing annually over 877,000 untailored pieces of cotton cloth from India.<sup>54</sup> And yet, because the Mughals controlled the ports in textile-rich Gujarat and Bengal, Europeans were in no position to dictate the terms of commerce. Rather, they had to petition imperial authorities for permission to establish trading enclaves. Even then, they could conduct business only on Mughal terms.

Nonetheless, Europe's new commercial connection with Indian markets had profound effects on the subcontinent's economy, as reflected in India's currencies. Prior to the Mughal era, only Gujarat possessed a reliable and stable silver coinage, based on the high volume of maritime commerce that had attracted silver from the Middle East ever since the early centuries AD. <sup>55</sup> Other Indian regions, lacking extensive silver mines of their own and not enjoying Gujarat's volume of overseas trade, relied on other media for their coinage, such as copper, gold, billon or cowrie shells. All this changed in the late sixteenth century. The Indian economy being largely self-sufficient, in order to purchase Indian goods Europeans had to export silver, the one foreign item that the Mughals lacked and wanted, apart from war-horses. Luckily for the fledgling overseas companies in England and the Netherlands, Spain's plundering of rich silver mines in Mexico and Peru from about 1550 was followed by the diffusion of tons of silver into northern Europe, driven largely by Spain's costly wars there between 1568 and 1648. That money, in turn, allowed both the Dutch and English companies literally to buy themselves into India's export markets.<sup>56</sup> Between 1586 and 1605, overseas silver flowed into the Mughal heartland at the stunning rate of about 185 metric tons a year. <sup>57</sup> 'India is rich in silver,' noted the English merchant William Hawkins in 1613, 'for all nations bring coyne and carry away commodities for the same.'<sup>58</sup> American silver arriving in India was immediately minted into silver rupees, which became the Mughals' principal currency medium from about 1580. In 1615 one observer estimated the Mughals' annual revenue at 120 million silver coins, compared to forty-five million for the Ottoman empire and just fifteen million for neighbouring Iran.<sup>59</sup> In fact, between 1600 and 1800 India absorbed about 20 per cent of the precious metals produced throughout the world.<sup>60</sup>

By the beginning of the seventeenth century, then, the Mughals had experienced two fundamental economic transformations. First, their conquest of north India and subsequent rule in the sixteenth century completed a long-term process that had been initiated by the Turkish invasions of upper India in the late twelfth century, whereby

the warrior institutions of semi-pastoral Central Asia merged with the revenue institutions of agrarian India.<sup>61</sup> By the end of the sixteenth century the Mughal empire had undergone a second transformation as it became integrated with a global economy, symbolized by Akbar's capture of Gujarat, India's most highly commercialized subregion. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, most imported silver was no longer carried to India by the Portuguese Estado da India, but by the Dutch, English and French trading companies. These north European companies, however, were not content with merely establishing enclaves where they would receive and ship to Europe finished goods that Indian merchants brought to their coastal warehouses. Rather, needing to maximize profits for their investors and stockholders back home, the managers of these companies endeavoured, wherever possible, to reduce costs by gaining direct or indirect control over the factors of production – the land, labour and capital – that went into making the goods.

The economic and political objectives of the English company would prove decisive in this respect. Ever since the mid sixteenth century (with much earlier antecedents), the English Parliament had been passing laws giving the state and employers coercive powers over English workers, while setting limits on their wages and controlling their mobility. Passed in 1563 and remaining on the books until 1813, the Statute of Artificers stipulated, among other things, that English workers could not leave an employer until after at least one year's labour for him, that workers seeking new employment required a termination certificate from a former employer, and that workers' wages would be set by government officials.62 Measures of this nature aligned with prevailing mercantilist thought that obliged the state to take any necessary steps to keep domestic manufactures competitive at home and abroad. And when Queen Elizabeth gave the East India Company a monopoly on England's trade with the Indian Ocean region, company officials took such ideas with them to India. For a century and a half after its founding in 1600, however, the Company was in no position to intervene coercively in the economic factors that had created the goods in

greatest demand at home, namely India's finely woven and worldrenowned cotton textiles, whether plain, printed, painted or patterned on the loom.

By contrast, neither the Mughals nor other Indian states with which the English company dealt claimed the right, or ever wished, to intervene directly in the production process. For officials of the Mughal empire and those of the English East India Company occupied very different moral universes. In 1778, for example, officers of the English company asked the nawab (ruler) of Arcot in the Tamil country to round up and forcibly return weavers who had fled from a company-controlled manufacturing centre. Astonished at the request, the nawab replied that such a thing was 'contrary to custom and it was never done before'.<sup>63</sup> Even taxation had its limits. Since the supply of arable land in pre-colonial India surpassed that of labour, villagers always had the option of simply abandoning their fields and establishing new settlements elsewhere if their taxes became too onerous. Aware of this, states sought non-coercive means to keep villagers productive. Emperor 'Alamgir, for example, ordered that if any cultivator abandoned his fields, local revenue officers 'should ascertain the cause and work very hard to induce him to return to his former place'.<sup>64</sup> Such an order hardly suggests a ruler governing from a position of overwhelming strength vis-à-vis India's labour force. For the Mughal empire was no mighty juggernaut, crushing everything in its path. On the contrary, despite its image as an absolute monarchy, Mughal officials co-operated with numerous stakeholders, making alliances with, and working through, countless petty *zamindar*s and other local elites.<sup>65</sup> Such officials were in no position to coerce merchants or others with whom they shared de facto sovereignty. <sup>66</sup> Far less did they establish strict production schedules for labourers, impose maximum wages for producers or restrict their mobility. Yet these were the very kinds of mercantalist measures that employees of the English East India Company considered fundamental for maximizing their profits.

It was in India's textile-manufacturing sector that such ideas most closely engaged with Indian economic realities. And for good reason.

Because their northern location and temperate climate prevented them from cultivating cotton, Europeans for centuries had clothed themselves in wool or linen. Spanish Arabs introduced cotton to Europeans in the tenth and eleventh centuries – the English word for the fibre is derived from the Arabic *qutun* – and from the twelfth century northern Italy supported a modest textile industry based on raw cotton imported from across the Mediterranean Sea. A strong demand for cotton products did not take hold in northern Europe, however, until after the establishment of direct maritime contact with India, which had been the world's leading manufacturer of cotton for more than five millennia.<sup>67</sup> This demand grew steadily through the seventeenth century. In 1664 alone, the English East India Company imported a quarter of a million pieces of cloth, nearly half of them from Coromandel, a third from Gujarat and less than a fifth from Bengal. Twenty years later the Company was annually importing 1.76 million pieces of Indian textiles to England, which represented 83 per cent of the Company's total trade.<sup>68</sup> This was the height of the so-called 'calico craze', when India's cotton textiles were in feverish demand in England and across Europe generally. Indeed, England's sustained commercial connection with India is seen in the many textile-related Indian words that entered the English language in this period – for example, dungaree, chintz, seersucker, calico, pyjamas, shawl, khaki, cummerbund, taffeta, jaconet and bandana.

Nor was this just an English craze. Indian textiles occupied the centre of a global phenomenon that transformed the economies and societies of five continents. By the dawn of the eighteenth century, India's cotton textiles had displaced rice and spices as the principal item of trade in the Indian Ocean. And by the mid eighteenth century, when more than three-quarters of all the English East India Company's imports from India consisted of textiles, Asia, Europe, Africa and the two Americas were all tightly integrated by the white fibre and the textiles spun from it. To obtain slaves for their transatlantic plantations, Europeans purchased captives from West Africa using mainly Indian textiles, which were in great demand among African merchants and political elites.<sup>69</sup>

However, in order to obtain the Indian textiles that were in such high demand in Europe and Africa, European payments to Indian merchants and producers had to be made mainly in treasure. This posed a serious problem, since, according to prevailing mercantilist thought, states should be hoarding silver and gold in their national treasuries, not exporting such precious metals for overseas purchases. Only by restricting the flow of silver bullion to India, and by reducing the cost of overseas purchases, could the Company align its commercial policies with mercantilist objectives. By acquiring political authority in India's major textile-producing regions – Coromandel, Bengal and Gujarat – the Company achieved both objectives. Two factors allowed this to occur. One was the fierce competition between European powers over access to India's textilemanufacturing sector, which led ultimately to armed conflict between Europeans. This, in turn, militarized the Company, which by the 1760s had a private army of 20,000, a figure that would grow to about 260,000 by 1803.<sup>70</sup> Second, from the mid eighteenth century, Indian rulers, in order to advance their own fortunes on an increasingly fragmented political stage, willingly surrendered revenue-collection rights in return for access to European weapons and/or European-trained soldiers. Such rights became the principal mechanism by which the English company would leverage its commercial operations into outright domination over Indian territory.

These processes began quietly enough in the 1750s along the Coromandel coast. There, rivalry between the French and English companies intensified when each company backed opposing claimants to succeed as the nawab of Arcot, a remnant of 'Alamgir's conquests in the south-eastern Deccan. In 1763, after armed forces of the British East India Company defeated those of the French company for commercial hegemony in the region, the British-backed nawab became heavily indebted to his European sponsors and surrendered to the British company the revenue-collecting rights to lands adjacent to its base at Madras. Later called Chingleput District, this region was styled the Company's *jagir*. The use of this Mughal administrative term suggested that the British were merely servants

of the nawab of Arcot, who in theory ruled under the authority of the nizam of Hyderabad, who governed the Deccan theoretically as governor (*subahdar*) of the emperor in Delhi. In this way the Company inserted itself on India's political map, albeit at the bottom of a largely fictitious chain of political authority that stretched from Delhi down to Chingleput.

Secure in their position as the legitimate collectors of revenue in their *jagir*, officers of the British company soon aligned their commercial operations with mercantilist ideals. By 1766, the Company was using its authority to order weavers in its *jagir* to accept advances only from Company merchants, thereby creating a monopoly of the textile trade in its territory. Company officials also began advancing loans directly to the weavers, thereby circumventing the merchants who had been doing that for generations. Placing the looms in their *jagir* under the supervision of a Commercial Resident, the Company was then in a position to reject any cloth that did not meet its stringent standards, impose minimum quotas of cloth to be produced per loom per month, reduce the amount of cash advanced to weavers, and insist upon prompt deliveries of goods to meet its tight shipping schedules, which were governed by monsoon winds. The Company also used its judicial power to enforce contracts made with producers, and its military power – in the form of Company-trained Indian soldiers, or *sepoy*s – to prevent weavers from absconding with cash advances. <sup>71</sup> By the 1760s, then, the profile of the Company had changed dramatically from what it had been for more than a century and a half. In short order, the political complexion of India, too, would change.

Similar developments took place in Mughal Bengal. In 1756 the British company had refused to obey the provincial nawab's orders to cease building fortifications, which were driven, again, by Anglo-French rivalry. In response, the impetuous twenty-three-year-old nawab seized the British company's base of Calcutta. The following year Robert Clive, a military officer who had already played a leading role in the Company's territorial acquisitions in Coromandel, was ordered to sail from Madras and recover the city. After accomplishing

that goal, Clive, being well beyond the reach of Company or Parliamentary checks on his ambition, exceeded the terms of his authorized mission by conspiring with the nawab's disaffected commander-in-chief to overthrow the unpopular nawab. In June 1757 he defeated the nawab's forces 150 kilometres north of Calcutta and then installed his native co-conspirator as Bengal's new Mughal nawab, who then became in effect a Company puppet.

After its troops defeated a coalition of Mughal armies at Buxor (thirteen kilometres west of Patna) in 1764, the East India Company tightened its de facto authority in Bengal. In the following year Clive personally met the virtually powerless Mughal emperor, Shah 'Alam II (r. 1759–1806), who signed a document – the so-called Diwani of Bengal (August 1765) – formally giving Company officers the right to assess and collect the province's revenue. As in Coromandel, the Company swiftly made use of its newly won political authority to enact mercantilist policies in eastern India. Company officials seized textiles woven for their Dutch rivals and obliged all weavers in Bengal to work exclusively for them. In 1767, pieces being made for the French were cut off the looms and their weavers made subject to bodily and monetary punishments. The Company also coerced intermediary merchants and weavers to work for them on terms far below the market, forcing many weavers to abandon their craft altogether. <sup>72</sup> Merchants who refused to sign papers agreeing to the Company's harsh terms were caned or jailed. In a poignant application of the new regime's economic philosophy, in 1767 one merchant who appeared before Company officials with a piece of cloth fifty centimetres shorter than the required length was made to rub his nose on the ground several times for that exact distance.<sup>73</sup>

Such disciplinary measures came more slowly where the Company still lacked political power or where, as in Gujarat, it was forced to share power with other actors.<sup>74</sup> Nonetheless, the 1765 Diwani of Bengal had set a precedent for what would subsequently happen elsewhere in India: the acquisition of de facto governing authority not through outright conquest but through mutual agreements concluded between regional powers and an overseas

trading company – albeit a company authorized not just to monopolize trade but to mint coins, exercise justice and wage war. Moreover, the Company's acquisition of Bengal's public finance meant that it could use that province's revenues to help pay for its investments in the region's goods for export, thereby sharply reducing its reliance on silver bullion shipped from Britain to India.<sup>75</sup> As a result, between 1760 and 1829 silver accounted for only 18.6 per cent of the value of goods that the Company sent to Asia, a significant drop from the period before 1756, when that metal accounted for 70–85 per cent of those exports.<sup>76</sup>

# CONCLUSION

As signs of Mughal decline, it is easy to conjure up striking images of foreign invaders pillaging the north Indian countryside. One can readily visualize Nadir Shah, having sacked Delhi in 1739, marching through the Khyber Pass with long columns of pack animals loaded with looted treasures that included Shah Jahan's Peacock Throne and the Koh-i-Noor diamond. A more accurate image of imperial decline, however, would be of the empire being undermined from within and below, in the way that termites silently hollow out the base of a wooden structure. Across eighteenth-century India, local power holders were able to challenge imperial authority with resources ultimately derived from the higher volume of cash that circulated throughout Indian society as a result of the commercialization of the entire Indian Ocean region. As merchant wealth expanded, new market centres were established, boosting development in both agrarian and manufacturing sectors. Land use was greatly intensified, as happened when pioneers in Bengal used cash to mobilize labour for transforming dense jungle into arable fields for the cultivation of food crops.

Although coastal tracts first felt the impact of imported silver, the coined metal quickly diffused into India's hinterland, owing, among other things, to the overall structure of the textile industry. Whereas cloth was woven, bleached, dyed and printed in coastal regions, the raw cotton was grown, harvested, cleaned and spun into yarn deep

in the interior. Bengal depended on yarn from Gujarat, Coromandel acquired its cotton from the Deccan, Gujarat relied on raw silk transported from Bengal. The cotton grown on the black soils of the central Deccan was brought 400 kilometres to Coromandel by nomadic clans – the Banjaras – on huge caravans of 10,000–40,000 bullocks each.<sup>77</sup> The entire hinterland of Madras was devoted to supplying rice to coastal markets and their weaving communities.<sup>78</sup> As a result, the growth of maritime commerce stimulated India's land-based economy both in the hinterland and along the coast.

But the diffusion of cash-based commerce into India's interior also had political consequences. Since access to India's military labour market was predicated on the availability of money, as more cash flowed from the coasts to the interior, provincial Mughal governors acquired greater means to mobilize standing armies with which to challenge or resist imperial demands. This also held true for intermediary orders of Indian society, including large and small *zamindar*s, transregional merchants, Sikh chieftains, powerful bankers and revenue farmers, among others. Especially prominent were *zamindar*s, India's ancient class of hereditary, quasi-royal landholders who, with their armed retainers, their legacies of former sovereignty (real or imagined) and their claims to a share of a territory's wealth, commanded respect and some legitimacy among rural folk. Neither the Mughals nor any other power had ever fully suppressed or co-opted them. Now, thanks to the waves of mobile wealth that washed over the Indo-Gangetic plain in the eighteenth century, *zamindar*s, always ready to reassert their ancient political claims, could challenge imperial authority by tapping into the military labour market.<sup>79</sup>

Ultimately, what enabled growing European influence in the second half of the eighteenth century in India was local demand for European weaponry or mercenaries, which Europeans happily supplied. A single incident suggests the general trend. In April 1758 the acting governor of Portuguese Goa wrote to Tarabai, at that time the aged dowager of the Maratha kingdom, that he would be most pleased to supply her with the 2,000 guns she had ordered, provided

she paid for them before delivery. <sup>80</sup> Tarabai duly furnished the cash, drawn from the accumulated stocks of silver that had been flowing into Indian coasts for the previous two and a half centuries.

Did such deals constitute a significant break with the past? Many historians have seen the mid eighteenth century as a major – if not *the* major – point of rupture in the flow of Indian history. Yet the entry of Europeans as political actors was built upon long-established Indian institutions. One of these were the well-developed revenueextracting bureaucracies that were still operating at local levels, even if the Mughal central government was not receiving those revenues. Another was India's long-standing and extensive military labour market. For centuries before the mid 1700s, ambitious Indian rulers or would-be rulers had been buying into indigenous markets of military labour in order to advance their claims to political authority. From the mid eighteenth century onwards, however, those same figures began contracting European-trained military labour or, as in the case of Tarabai's dealings with the acting governor of Goa, European weaponry. Yet the reverse also occurred, as both Frenchmen and – more successfully – Englishmen tapped into India's indigenous military labour market. 'British conquest', writes the historian C. A. Bayly, 'often meant no more than the slow drift to the East India Company of soldiers, merchants and administrators, leaving the Indian rulers with nothing more than a husk of royal grandeur.'<sup>81</sup>

In both moral and economic terms, then, the advent of a ruthlessly mercantilist ideology carried to South Asia by the East India Company certainly did represent a radical break with the Indian past. And yet neither that ideology nor its carrier – the British company – could have taken root and flourished without the pre-existing institution of India's military labour market.
