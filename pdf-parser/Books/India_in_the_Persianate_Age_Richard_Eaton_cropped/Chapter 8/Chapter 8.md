# Aurangzeb – from Prince to Emperor 'Alamgir, 1618– 1707

I know my fortune in extremes does lie: The Sons of Indostan must Reign, or die, That desperate hazard Courage does create, As he plays frankly, who has least Estate, And that the World the Coward will despise. When Life's a Blank, who pulls not for a Prize?

– *John Dryden,* Aureng-zebe: A Tragedy *(written 1675)*<sup>1</sup>

#### PRINCE AURANGZEB – FOUR VIGNETTES

On 7 June 1633, Shah Jahan indulged in one of his favourite pastimes: watching two huge male elephants engage in combat. The spectacle was usually performed near the banks of the Jamuna and viewed from a balcony built into the emperor's palace in Agra. At one point on this occasion, the two beasts had grappled with each other directly below the emperor's balcony, preventing him from seeing the action. So he and his three eldest sons – Dara Shukoh, Shuja' and Aurangzeb – went down to the ground level, mounted horses and

rode out to have a closer look. Noticing the newcomers, one of the elephants suddenly wheeled, trumpeted loudly and charged the nearest figure in sight, which happened to be the fourteen-year-old Aurangzeb. 'The lion-hearted youth,' records a chronicler of Shah Jahan's reign:

with the greatest courage and intrepidity did not stir from his post; but as soon as the elephant approached, he galloped at it and rose up in his stirrups and hurled his spear with his whole strength against its forehead. The monster, smarting from the wound, again rushed furiously to the attack; and the steed of that 'bold knight on the battlefield of valor' being struck in the flanks by the elephant's trunk rolled over from the violence of the shock. The instant Prince Aurangzeb fell from his saddle on to the ground, he sprang nimbly up, and stood sword in hand, ready to strike.<sup>2</sup>

In the midst of the confusion – the dust, shouting, fireworks, rockets, smoke – the other elephant, seeing his opponent otherwise preoccupied, seized the opportunity to resume the fight, thus sparing any more drama for the prince. By this time Shah Jahan himself had rushed to the scene, where he warmly embraced his son, relieved to find him unharmed.

The event seared deep into the memory of the amazed onlookers. It was also the first time that the court's chroniclers would pay significant notice to Shah Jahan's third son. In fact, the scene was twice memorialized in miniature paintings, the first one made within a few years of the event and included in the *Padshahnama*, the emperor's official chronicle [see Fig. 17].<sup>3</sup> In both images, Aurangzeb is depicted steadying his horse while driving his spear into the brow of the charging tusker, revealing the prince's steely courage in the face of grave danger. By contrast, his elder brother Dara Shukoh – later his sworn enemy – is seen watching the action from a safe distance. The painting affords an early glimpse into the contrasting characters of the brothers.

A year later, Shah Jahan gave Aurangzeb a *mansab* of 10,000, his first position in the Mughal hierarchy. A year after that, in 1635, he was sent off on an imperial campaign to capture and punish the rebel chieftain Jhujhar Singh Bundela. Although the sixteen-year-old prince held only nominal command of the army, the experience gave him his first direct exposure to military strategy, logistics and operations. At the conclusion of this successful campaign he proceeded south to Burhanpur, the seat of government for the Mughal-controlled Deccan. Unlike the older provinces to the north, which had been under imperial administration since the days of Akbar, the Mughal Deccan lay on the cutting edge of a rapidly moving frontier that faced three venerable sultanates: the quickly disintegrating Nizam Shahi kingdom of Ahmadnagar in the northwestern Deccan, and two strong and hostile kingdoms to the south, the 'Adil Shahi kingdom of Bijapur and the Qutb Shahi kingdom of Golconda. In early 1636 Shah Jahan marched down to the ancient stronghold of Daulatabad to oversee the empire's forward operations against these three states. Whereas the sultan of Golconda submitted to a show of force and agreed to become a tributary vassal of the Mughals, Sultan Muhammad 'Adil Shah of Bijapur resisted. On reaching a military stalemate, in mid 1636 the two parties concluded an agreement whereby Bijapur would acknowledge the Mughals as overlords but would not be a tributary vassal like Golconda; the two states would divide between them the remaining territory of the kingdom of Ahmadnagar, now formally extinguished; and neither side would try to lure the other's officers into its service.

Having concluded the treaties with the two states, the emperor returned to Agra, leaving Aurangzeb in Burhanpur to govern the Mughal Deccan and to see that the treaty's terms were properly carried out. The governor, still only eighteen years old, soon acquired a taste for extorting as much as he could from Golconda while remaining technically within the terms of the 1636 treaty. He was also eager to annex territory from previously unconquered states in the region, such as Baglana, a strategically important strip of land along the lower Tapti valley. In early 1638 the prince, having

obtained his father's permission to pursue this forward policy, sent an army into the region, overwhelming the mountain strongholds of Salhir and Mulhir. He then annexed the whole territory into the empire, absorbed its former rulers into Mughal state service and added Baglana's annual revenue of 400,000 rupees to imperial coffers. The ease with which Aurangzeb accomplished this operation might explain his imagining, much later in life, that conquering the rest of the Deccan would be just as manageable.

Another omen portending Aurangzeb's future operations in the Deccan, which would occupy the last twenty-five years of his life, was the ability of the most talented Maratha commander in the region to elude his grasp. This was Shahji Bhonsle (1594–1664), whose father had been the right-hand man of Malik Ambar, the Ethiopian ex-slave who for two decades had fended off Jahangir's repeated attempts to annex the Nizam Shahi kingdom of Ahmadnagar. After Ambar's death in 1626 and the surrender in 1633 of Daulatabad (the kingdom's capital since 1610) to the Mughals, it was Shahji who picked up the pieces of the crumbling state of Ahmadnagar. This he did by finding and crowning as sultan an eleven-year-old remnant of the Nizam Shahi house, for whom Shahji acted as chief minister and commander-in-chief, or *peshwa*. With 12,000 troops under his command, he managed to recover a number of forts in the old Nizam Shahi territory, boldly running a guerrilla operation against both Bijapur and the Mughals. In 1639 Aurangzeb managed to track down and kill Shahji's first cousin, a former Nizam Shahi officer who had taken to banditry. But he had no such luck with Shahji himself, who by then had abandoned the Nizam Shahi cause and enlisted with Bijapur.

In May 1644 an unexpected event drew Aurangzeb from his posting in the Deccan to the imperial court at Agra. His eldest sister Jahanara, Shah Jahan's favourite daughter, had suffered severe burns when her dress caught fire from a candle in Agra fort, and for weeks her life hung in the balance. As all her siblings were full brothers and sisters born of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, the entire royal family responded with affection and concern. Aurangzeb's elder brother Shuja' reached Agra from his post as

governor of Bengal, while his younger brother Murad arrived from his as governor of Gujarat. These three brothers had all been governing large provinces and commanding armies. By contrast the firstborn son, Dara Shukoh, had only briefly governed the Punjab in 1635–6, but since then remained in Agra. It seemed to all that, as the emperor's favourite son, he was being kept at court and groomed to succeed Shah Jahan [see Fig. 19]. This was certainly clear to Aurangzeb, who harboured a growing hostility towards Dara. The feeling, moreover, was mutual.

At some point, while the family poured out its sympathy and prayers for the ailing Jahanara, Dara invited his father and brothers to see his newly built mansion in Agra. 'As it was the summer season,' records a contemporary source:

an underground room had been constructed close to the river … Dara conducted Shah Jahan and his brothers to see how the room looked. Muhammad Aurangzib sat down close to the [only] door leading in and out of the room. Dara seeing it winked at the Emperor, as if to say 'See where he is sitting.' His majesty said, 'My child, though I know you to be learned and hermit-like, yet it is also needful to maintain one's rank … What necessity is there for you to sit down in the path by which people pass, and in a position below and behind your younger brother [Murad]?' Aurangzib replied, 'I shall afterwards tell you the reason of my sitting here.' After a short time he rose on the plea of performing his mid-day prayer, and went back from the place to his own house without taking the Emperor's permission. When the Emperor heard of it he forbade him the Court, so that the Prince was debarred from the audience for seven months.<sup>4</sup>

More so than Aurangzeb's youthful encounter with the elephant, this vignette speaks of the poisonous relations between Dara and Aurangzeb. The eldest son's knowing wink to their father suggests his privileged status at court, from which the younger brother would soon be expelled for more than half a year. Upon recovering from

her burns, Jahanara, the family peacemaker and coolest head, asked Aurangzeb to explain his strange behaviour in the underground room. His reply: he feared that Dara, taking advantage of that unguarded, confined space, might shut the door and dispatch all his brothers by way of ensuring his path to the throne. When Jahanara conveyed this explanation to their father, the emperor summoned Aurangzeb and showered him with favours. But this did nothing to heal the rift between the two brothers, whose relationship had now reached an impasse. Convinced that he and Dara could not be at court at the same time, Aurangzeb approached the prime minister and begged to be posted elsewhere. The minister intervened and the emperor obliged, reassigning him to Gujarat, which he governed from 1645 to 1647.<sup>5</sup>

Meanwhile, Shah Jahan began acting on the grandiose title 'Second Lord of the Conjunction' that he had given himself. Vaguely associated with millennialism, the title also alluded to his dynasty's esteemed ancestor Timur, allegedly the 'Lord of the Conjunction,' and to his vast empire. Shah Jahan therefore aimed to re-establish some sovereign connection with Timur's Central Asian empire, or at least the part of it south of the Oxus – Balkh and Badakhshan – that had belonged to Babur's patrimony. This was the context for the invasion mentioned in the previous chapter. Although Uzbek Turks had dominated the region since expelling Babur in the early sixteenth century, by the 1640s they were engulfed in a civil war that, in Shah Jahan's view, invited outside intervention. Short of reclaiming Balkh and Badakhshan by outright annexation, the emperor hoped at least to reduce the region to tributary status. So in 1646 he put his youngest son, Murad, at the head of an army of 50,000 troops that marched over the Hindu Kush Mountains and occupied the city of Balkh. But the young prince soon grew tired of the country's harsh terrain and begged permission to return. When his father refused, he abandoned his command and returned to India in disgrace, leaving his leaderless army behind.

India, 1680–1707

To rescue the crippled Central Asian campaign, the emperor then called on Aurangzeb, who reached Balkh in May 1647. By that time, however, nearly half of Murad's troops had also abandoned the mission, leaving the several Mughal garrisons in Badakhshan and Balkh severely undermanned. Nonetheless, upon learning that a powerful Uzbek force had crossed the Oxus and was pressing on into Mughal-occupied territory, Aurangzeb marched north-west to

meet it. When the two armies engaged, the Uzbek commander personally witnessed the Mughal prince's cool courage amidst fierce combat, as recorded in a widely circulated anecdote:

While the Mughal army was fighting desperately with the vast legions of Abdul Aziz Khan, King of Bukhara, the time for the [noon] prayer [*zuhar*] arrived. Disregarding the prohibitions of his officers, Aurangzeb dismounted from his elephant, knelt down on the ground, and deliberately and peacefully went through all the ceremonies of the prayer, in full view of both the armies. Abdul Aziz on hearing of it cried out, 'To fight with such a man is to ruin one's self,' and suspended the battle.<sup>6</sup>

As winter approached and his army faced starvation owing to local grain scarcities and uncertain supply lines from India, Aurangzeb hastily arranged a peace with the Uzbeks and headed south. By late October his army reached the steep and icy passes cutting through the Hindu Kush range. Although he and his forward units safely reached Kabul before the heavy snows began, the treasure-escort, the supplies and thousands of troops and animals were not so lucky. Between Bamian and Kabul, especially while negotiating the 3,000 metre Shibar Pass, the army lost 5,000 men and as many animals – all buried under the snow. When the snow melted the next spring, piles of bones emerged along the pathways.<sup>7</sup> In the end, the Mughals' two-year campaign accomplished nothing beyond displaying the emperor's vanity. But it did consume forty million rupees, nearly seven times the cost to build Shahjahanabad, and eight times the cost of the Taj Mahal.

The failed Uzbek campaign was soon followed by a crisis with more formidable rivals, the Safavid rulers of Iran, over the strategic stronghold of Kandahar in southern Afghanistan. Having changed hands five times since Babur captured it in 1522, this strategic outpost was seen by each empire as vital for protecting its frontier. In early 1649 a Safavid army again laid siege to the garrison. Determined not to lose it again, the emperor called on Aurangzeb to lead an army of 50,000 to defend the fort. But by the time he arrived

that March, it had already fallen, so the prince was ordered to retreat. With Mughal honour now at stake, Shah Jahan devoted the next three years to building up a huge army to mount a second attempt. In May 1652 60,000 troops, again under Aurangzeb's command, arrived before the fort with substantial siege artillery. This time, however, the prince was let down by his incompetent artillerymen, who either blew up their cannon with overloaded powder or fired cannonballs that sank harmlessly into the fort's mud walls. Worse was the interference of Shah Jahan, who had moved up to Kabul to oversee the siege, but whose proximity only enabled him to hector his son about his handling of military operations. With no progress to account for the effort, the emperor ultimately ordered a retreat, and the frustrated prince had to march from Kandahar back to Kabul. En route he received letters in which the emperor challenged his son's military competence, asserting that if he had considered the prince capable of taking the fort, he would not have ordered the retreat. With that swipe, Aurangzeb was instructed to return immediately to the Deccan and take up a second posting there as governor. Compounding his bitterness, Aurangzeb learnt that back in Agra Dara Shukoh, instead of showing support for the Mughal effort at Kandahar, mocked his younger brother, making his failure an object of ridicule.<sup>8</sup>

But the emperor was still not ready to concede failure. In 1653 he ordered a third and final attempt to recover the fort, this time sending Dara to lead the effort, even though his eldest son had never yet led a major military operation. But that didn't prevent him from boasting that he would easily take the fort within a week, and perhaps even continue westwards and conquer Herat as well. An army of 70,000 men was mobilized, accompanied by a host of heavy artillery, 150,000 kilos of powder and 30,000 cannon balls, some of them weighing up to fifty kilos. But this expedition, lasting from April to September 1653, failed spectacularly. A contemporary account of the campaign portrays the prince as stubborn yet easily swayed by flattery, abusive when thwarted, prone to the use of magic for guidance, insensitive to the suffering of his own troops, and

thoroughly incompetent as a commander. 9 In all, the three Kandahar expeditions had cost 120 million rupees, which was more than half of the empire's entire gross annual revenue, or twenty-four times the expense of building the Taj Mahal.<sup>10</sup>

These costly failures only deepened the rift between Aurangzeb and his father. But it had not always been that way. When the sixteen-year-old accompanied the army sent to pursue the rebel Jhujhar Singh and from Bundelkhand, he wrote his father glowing letters of the region's picturesque scenery – its forests, large artificial lakes, hills, wild game, and so on. Shah Jahan was so affected that he made a diversion from his march in order to join the young prince, and together the two made a sightseeing tour of the region's waterfalls and other natural sites.<sup>11</sup> Later, the emperor was genuinely puzzled by Aurangzeb's strange behaviour in Dara Shukoh's underground room in Agra, apparently unaware of the extent of the brothers' mutual animosity. The prince's subsequent banishment from court certainly strained the father–son relationship. Nonetheless, the emperor understood that, of his four sons, Aurangzeb was the ablest commander, which explains his reluctance to give high commands to the other three. The failed second siege of Kandahar, however, marked something of a turning point. In the same letter in which he blamed Aurangzeb for the siege's failure, the emperor advised the prince that he was being deprived of his lucrative *jagir*s in Multan and upper Sind, that his salary was being reduced by 1.7 million rupees, and that – as if to rub salt in his wounds – Dara Shukoh would command the third siege at Kandahar, for which purpose he would receive additional large and fertile *jagir*s in Gujarat.<sup>12</sup> En route to taking up his second posting as governor of the Deccan, Aurangzeb stopped in Delhi for several days, in the course of which he visited his brother Shuja' in the garden of their sister Jahanara's estate. Here the brothers arranged that Aurangzeb's son Muhammad Sultan would marry Shuja''s daughter, thereby cementing an alliance between the emperor's second and third sons.<sup>13</sup> It seems that Aurangzeb was already anticipating a

post-Shah Jahan era, for which isolating Dara politically was a first step.

From Delhi Aurangzeb continued down to the Deccan, but instead of taking up his position in a new capital deeper south in the Mughal Deccan, he lingered for nine months – from January to October 1653 – in the old provincial capital of Burhanpur. The reason for the delay was an affair of the heart. Notwithstanding that he was thirty-five and already had several wives and children, Aurangzeb now had his first and only truly romantic relationship, so far as we know. The object of his affections was a young girl of uncommon beauty named Hira Bai Zainabadi, a Hindu slave and singer, skilled in music, who was kept in the household of his maternal aunt's husband. One day the prince happened to notice her as she was strolling, unveiled, by the banks of the Tapti near Burhanpur. He was immediately smitten. In the course of the walk, we are told, Hira Bai:

saw a mango tree laden with fruit. Without considering the respect due to the Prince, she ran forward joyfully and playfully, and leapt up on the tree and plucked a fruit. This movement was a heart-robbing one and it robbed the Prince of his self-control and his virtue … By begging and imploring he obtained possession of her from his indulgent aunt and with all his asceticism and purity he gave his heart to her and used to fill a cup of wine with his own hand and give it to her.

It is stated that she too one day put a cup of wine into the Prince's hand and urged him to drink it. Though he begged and prayed, she had no pity on him and the Prince was helpless, and was about to drink it, when the sly girl drank it off herself, saying: It was to test your love and not to make your palate bitter with the liquor full of evil.<sup>14</sup>

Those months in Burhanpur were surely among the most carefree in Aurangzeb's life – hunting antelope, riding about on horseback, climbing Daulatabad's fort, visiting the caves of Ellora – probably with Hira Bai at his side. We know, too, that word of the prince's dalliance with the singer reached the emperor, who in May 1653

sternly reprimanded his son for his personal conduct. In reply, Aurangzeb protested vehemently that 'the reports recently laid before Your Majesty are a tissue of lies', and asked rhetorically, 'how could I sink to such a depth?'.<sup>15</sup> Inevitably, Dara Shukoh seized on the salacious rumours swirling through the court, saying, 'See the piety and abstinence of this hypocritical knave! He has gone to the dogs for the sake of a wench of his aunt's household.'<sup>16</sup>

Within a year, however, the girl died, which plunged Aurangzeb into a state of anguish and heartbreak. But the affair would have its after-effects. Niccolao Manucci, a Venetian mercenary who lived in India from 1653 to 1708 and enjoyed close ties to the court, wrote that, long after the girl's death, Aurangzeb 'was accustomed to say that God had been very gracious to him by putting an end to that dancing-girl's life, by reason of whom he had committed so many iniquities, and had run the risk of never reigning through being occupied in vicious practices'.<sup>17</sup> In short, Aurangzeb never forgot his brief but doomed affair with Hira Bai. Nor did he forget her snatching that glass of wine from his willing lips. For she had tested and nearly destroyed his self-control, an attribute that as emperor he would consider absolutely essential for maintaining his grip on power.

From Burhanpur, Aurangzeb moved down to Kirki, the new Mughal provincial capital which the prince renamed Aurangabad, after himself. The next four years he devoted to restoring Mughal administration, as it had fallen into a sorry state since his first governorship in the Deccan. Under a series of corrupt imperial officials, revenues had fallen steeply, cultivators had abandoned their villages, and arable land had lapsed into jungle. This was compounded by problems of security. In his communications with his father, the prince repeatedly stressed that, unlike the empire's interior provinces, or coastal provinces such as Gujarat or Bengal, the Mughal Deccan faced two powerful and rich sultanates, Golconda and Bijapur. Though technically at peace with them since the treaty of 1636, both were hostile and dangerous, requiring substantial troops to keep them in check. But he could collect only a third of the assessed revenue, and in some parts only a tenth, as a

result of which the central treasury had to subsidize much of the province's administrative expenses. Yet the emperor, convinced that the province should be self-supporting, and loath to maintain such subsidies, ordered his son to reclaim the lands of unproductive *jagirdar*s. Aurangzeb complied, which only led the dispossessed nobles to intrigue in court against him, persuading the emperor that his son had been enriching himself at their own expense.

Matters did stabilize, however, after Aurangzeb appointed as his revenue minister Murshid Quli Khan, an Iranian migrant who had joined Aurangzeb's staff as paymaster during the Balkh campaign. Whereas revenue assessment in the Deccan had traditionally been calculated simply by counting the number of cultivators' ploughs, the new minister applied the Mughals' *zabt* system of revenue assessment and collection. Murshid Quli Khan oversaw teams of surveyors and assessors who went into the villages, measured the land and prepared detailed records on the basis of which accurate revenue assessments could be made. The minister himself reportedly joined his men, dragging measuring chains across fields with his own hands.<sup>18</sup> As a result, under Aurangzeb's administration villagers regained confidence in the honesty of the government, and as agriculture began to flourish, revenue increased. Yet these administrative successes did not end the prince's feuds with his father. Rather, their quarrels simply shifted to matters of foreign policy. Aurangzeb had always favoured an aggressive posture towards the two remaining Deccan sultanates, Bijapur and Golconda, but felt constrained by the 1636 treaty, which had stabilized Mughal relations with both states, and which the emperor was committed to honouring. Moreover, since Mughal ambassadors to those states reported directly to Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb felt cut out of diplomacy that he regarded as properly belonging in his own domain. But in 1656 events in both states provided the prince with rationales for invading and annexing them, if only his father would sanction such initiatives.

The first to feel Aurangzeb's pressure was Golconda. The prime minister of that kingdom was another Iranian immigrant, Mir Jumla

(d. 1663), who had amassed such immense wealth as a gemmerchant that he raised and commanded his own armies, which roused the intense jealousy of his master, the sultan. Upon learning that the sultan sought to ruin him, Mir Jumla made overtures to Aurangzeb about defecting to Mughal service, which the prince warmly welcomed even though the 1636 treaty had banned such intrigues. When the sultan imprisoned Mir Jumla's son on account of improper behaviour in court, Shah Jahan sanctioned Aurangzeb's request to invade if that son were not released. But by the time the sultan set Mir Jumla's son free, Aurangzeb had already sent a Mughal army to invade and plunder Hyderabad, near Golconda fort. The prince now begged his father for permission to annex the southern quarter of the kingdom (extending south to the Palar River), on the grounds that that enormous area had formerly been the *jagir* of Mir Jumla, who had recently defected to Mughal service. He also played upon his father's well-known weakness for jewels, portraying Golconda as a land awash with diamonds and buried treasures, ripe for the picking. In this effort he was helped by Mir Jumla, who presented Shah Jahan with the world's largest diamond, the celebrated Koh-i-Noor. <sup>19</sup> At the same time, Golconda's agents in Delhi, knowing that Dara would do anything to deny his brother the glory of annexing Golconda's territory, lobbied Shah Jahan, through Dara, against annexation. But the emperor's greed, as Aurangzeb correctly calculated, trumped any scruples he might have had. So he approved the annexation.

The year 1656 also proved momentous for Bijapur, the most powerful remaining Deccan sultanate. Because the treaty of 1636 had confirmed his northern frontier with the Mughals, Sultan Muhammad 'Adil Shah was free to send his armies deep into the south, conquering and annexing territory belonging to the scattered and disunited former vassals of the once-mighty Vijayanagara empire, as described in Chapter Four. These included Ikkeri and Bednur in the western peninsula, Bangalore and Mysore in midplateau, and the entire Kaveri valley eastwards to the Bay of Bengal, together with the stronghold of Jinji near the Coromandel coast. But

Bijapur would not enjoy these new possessions for long. Aurangzeb had planted Mir Jumla in Delhi with a view to tempting the emperor with ever more diamonds and other jewels in both Golconda's and Bijapur's southern territories. In November 1656 the prince's opportunity arrived with the news of Muhammad 'Adil Shah's death, followed by rumours that his eighteen-year-old son was not of legitimate parentage and was therefore barred from lawfully succeeding as sultan. Welcoming such rumours as a gift from heaven, Aurangzeb immediately requested permission to invade and annex the whole of Bijapur on the grounds that it had no legitimate sovereign. Upon receiving his father's sanction, he besieged the former Bahmani capital of Bidar, then under Bijapur's rule, and when it fell in March 1657 he moved on to Kalyana, the other formidable stronghold defending Bijapur's northern frontier. That fort surrendered in August. Seeing that nothing was likely to stop him from besieging and possibly capturing Bijapur's capital itself, Dara Shukoh, driven by a seething jealousy over his younger brother's successes, managed to persuade his father to call off the invasion. Bitterly aware that this was all Dara's doing, Aurangzeb had no choice but to pull back. The stage was set for a decisive moment in Mughal history.

#### WAR OF SUCCESSION, 1657–9

On 6 September, within a month of Aurangzeb's withdrawal from Bijapur, Shah Jahan fell ill, so grievously that rumours sped throughout India that he faced imminent death. From an early age Mughal princes were acutely aware that their brothers, though possibly playmates in childhood, would become deadly enemies when their father died. And they well understood that only one of them would survive the struggle to succeed him: according to the well-known Persian proverb, it was 'either the throne, or the coffin' (*ya takht, ya takhta*). The news of the emperor's illness therefore sparked a four-way struggle among Shah Jahan's four sons, India's bloodiest and most notorious war of succession.

If Aurangzeb's disputes with his father frustrated the prince, they were at least limited mainly to matters of public policy, diplomacy and administration. His relationship with Dara Shukoh, by contrast, had deteriorated to a poisonous, mutual hatred. But until the last year of Dara's life, their rivalry had not concerned religion. Both brothers respected and were patrons of spiritual specialists of all traditions. Dara Shukoh famously consorted with Brahmin pundits and eminent Sufi shaikhs, in particular those of the Qadiri order. Aurangzeb issued dozens of documents between 1659 and 1703 supporting a variety of religious individuals and institutions: Jain saints, sadhus and monasteries (*math*s), temple Brahmins, *gosain*s (wandering ascetics), Jangams (Śaiva priests), Hindu preceptors and yogis.<sup>20</sup> Both brothers had thoroughly imbibed the culture of institutional Sufism. Dara authored three treatises and two biographical dictionaries on the subject, while Aurangzeb throughout his life patronized Sufi shrines and revered holy men.<sup>21</sup> The bitter antagonism between the brothers took a religious turn only once the War of Succession had begun. This was due partly to heightened antagonisms triggered by the war itself, and partly to the evolution of Dara's own religious thinking.

François Bernier, the French physician who briefly served Dara Shukoh during the War of Succession, noticed that the prince was constantly surrounded by Brahmins, to whom he gave large pensions. He also described him as a religious chameleon, outwardly professing Islam, but privately 'a Gentile [Hindu] with Gentiles, and a Christian with Christians'.<sup>22</sup> But the true extent of Dara's religious adventurism lies in his treatises. One of his preoccupations centred on a classic theme of Indian philosophy: the problem of how to reconcile the renunciation of the world, necessary for achieving spiritual liberation, with engagement in the world, necessary for upholding and maintaining a functioning society. Even for ordinary householders, this tension could be a source of anxiety; but for a ruler charged with overseeing the social order of an entire kingdom, the contradiction could be especially acute. For Dara, this anxiety came to a head in late 1653. While returning to north India

from Afghanistan, where he had just led a failed effort to recapture Kandahar from the Iranians, he passed through Lahore, where he visited a Punjabi holy man, Baba Lal. In the wake of his stunning defeat at Kandahar, the prince would have been acutely aware of the tension between his spiritual life and the demands of rulership, especially since Shah Jahan had been grooming him for the throne.<sup>23</sup> The questions he put to Baba Lal therefore focused principally on the compatibility of rulership and renunciation.<sup>24</sup> Baba Lal advised Dara that in every religious community a spiritually perfected person stands out from the common mass, and through that person's blessings the community is saved by God.<sup>25</sup> This assertion seems to have furnished Dara with a cogent solution to the renunciation vs engagement dilemma, for in his treatise *Sakinat alauliya* the prince emphasized that, among Mughal rulers, he alone had been divinely chosen for a special spiritual role.<sup>26</sup> By 1655 he was already referring to himself in exalted terms, including king (*shah*), a highly accomplished saint and 'the perfect manifestation of virtuous conduct'.<sup>27</sup> In short, as the inevitable struggle for succession to the Peacock Throne drew near, an important part of Dara's political calculation appears to have been to present himself as someone who had access to divine secrets unavailable to other mortals.<sup>28</sup>

Dara Shukoh's final intellectual project, completed just months before Shah Jahan fell ill, was the capstone of his religious explorations – an audacious reformulation of the foundations of Islam itself. In a sense, his 'discoveries' of the roots of Islam logically followed from his studies of princely dialogues with ascetics and his fashioning of himself as a spiritually accomplished Perfect Man (a Sufi conception) and an Indian saint-king. In his treatise *Sirr-i akbar* ('The Greatest Secret'), Dara discusses his quest for the roots of monotheism in all human societies. After researching Judaic, Christian, Islamic and Indian traditions, he claims finally to have found such roots in ancient Indian scriptures, namely the Upanishads, which comprise the essence of the four Vedas.<sup>29</sup> In 1656–7 he assembled a group of learned Brahmins of Benares and

translated essential parts of the Upanishads into Persian. He also seized upon a Qur'anic passage stating that the Qur'an itself is 'in a hidden Book [that] none but the purified shall touch, a sending down from the Lord of all Being'.<sup>30</sup> Placing this passage side by side with his monotheistic reading of the Upanishads, Dara convinced himself that the 'hidden Book' mentioned in the Qur'an was in fact the Upanishads.<sup>31</sup>

Dara's researches and striking conclusions had unexpected consequences. A copy of his Persian translation of the Upanishads was later acquired by the French Orientalist A. H. Anquetil-Duperron (d. 1805), who in turn translated it into Latin, a copy of which found its way to the library and even the bedside of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer (d. 1860). By such circuitous pathways, interest in ancient Indian philosophy quickened in nineteenth-century Europe.<sup>32</sup> In India, however, Dara's ideas that a full understanding of Islam depended upon the study of the Upanishads, and that those scriptures anticipated Islamic monotheism, were seen by many as theologically deviant. Foremost among these was his younger brother and most dangerous rival. On the conclusion of the War of Succession, and only a year after the *Sirr-i akbar* was completed, Aurangzeb invoked Dara's naming the Vedas a divine book as one of the grounds for his execution.<sup>33</sup>

Leading up to the succession struggle, however, Dara's greatest difficulties were political, as his arrogance and immature behaviour alienated the very nobles whose support he would have needed in his final confrontations with Aurangzeb. He told the Mughals' powerful Rajput ally Jai Singh (d. 1667), the Kachhwaha raja of Amber, that he looked like a musician, a serious insult. The raja remained quiet at the time, but was said to have determined on vengeance, which he would later have. The prince also ridiculed Mir Jumla, ordering his staff to mock the general's gait and gestures; he too would turn against Dara, as would other prominent nobles.<sup>34</sup> Danishmand Khan (d. 1670) resigned as cavalry captain because of Dara's anger at him for upholding Shah Jahan's absolute authority. Owing to some real or imaginary affront, Shaista Khan (d. 1694)

greatly disliked Dara and gladly contributed to his downfall. Most seriously, perhaps, Dara on one occasion committed the unforgivable affront of beating Khalil Allah Khan (d. 1662) with his shoe. At a crucial point in the pivotal Battle of Samugarh (1658), the Uzbek commander would take his revenge by advising Dara, for his 'personal safety', to dismount from his elephant and mount a horse. As Khalil Allah expected, Dara's men could no longer see their leader and so, assuming he had been killed, panicked and fled the battlefield.<sup>35</sup>

To be sure, when hostilities eventually broke out, Dara did enjoy the support of Shah Jahan and those nobles present at court. No matter what their private sympathies might have been, the latter were at least nominally loyal to the eldest prince. Residing in Delhi, the empire's geographical and administrative centre, also gave Dara logistical assets such as the ability to control the flow of information to and from the court. But such advantages were offset by his military and political incompetence, in contrast to Aurangzeb's extensive military experience, his known abilities as a commander, his superior skills in political networking and his cool, calculating character. Manucci described Aurangzeb as totally different from his brothers, 'very secretive and serious, carrying on his affairs in a hidden way, but most energetically. He was of a melancholy temperament, always busy at something or another.'<sup>36</sup> And François Bernier: 'Aureng-Zebe … was devoid of that urbanity and engaging presence, so much admired in Dara; but he possessed a sounder judgment, and was more skillful in selecting for confidants such persons as were best qualified to serve him with faithfulness and ability.' The Frenchman added that 'his life had been one of undeviating intrigue and contrivance; conducted, however, with such admirable skill, that every person in the court, excepting only his brother, *Dara*, seemed to form an erroneous estimate of his character.'<sup>37</sup>

Accordingly, in the months after September 1657, when news of Shah Jahan's illness sped throughout the realm, Aurangzeb prudently held back from committing himself to a succession

struggle, even though by early December his brothers Murad and Shuja' had both impetuously crowned themselves emperor and were mobilizing armies to march on Agra and Delhi. From Bengal Shuja' was the first to advance towards these cities, prompting Dara to send his son Sulaiman Shukoh and top generals down the Ganges valley to check the threat, which they did in February 1658. In Gujarat, meanwhile, Murad had extorted money from merchants of the wealthy seaport of Surat in order to finance his own invasion of the capital. In Delhi, Dara, acting in the name of the ailing Shah Jahan and seeking to defang the brother he feared most, recalled Shaista Khan and Mir Jumla from the Deccan, unaware that both generals secretly supported Aurangzeb. He also persuaded Jaswant Singh, the Rathor raja of Marwar, to lead a Mughal army to check Murad's northward advance from Gujarat. But, as late as March 1658, Aurangzeb held back in Burhanpur, extorting money from Bijapur for his own army while secretly conspiring with Murad to join their two armies, defeat Dara and divide the empire between them. Meanwhile his sister and ally Raushanara was smuggling messages out of Delhi, evading Dara's spies and roadblocks and informing Aurangzeb as to their eldest brother's actions and intentions.

In late March 1658, Aurangzeb finally left Burhanpur for north India – not, ostensibly, as a contender for the throne like Murad and Shuja', but as the dutiful son piously paying a visit to his ailing father. In mid April his army joined that of Murad south of Ujjain, and several days later, at the Battle of Dharmat, their combined forces of 40,000 completely routed an imperial force of the same size fighting on behalf of Dara. Although Murad fought well in this engagement, it was Aurangzeb's reputation as an accomplished field commander that coursed through the empire's informal networks, much to Dara's dismay. In late May Aurangzeb and Murad crossed the Chambal, cleverly skirting Dara's artillery defences along that river's usual crossing points. At this point Shah Jahan offered personally to go out and persuade the two princes to return to their provincial postings, it being unthinkable that any of his sons would challenge their father in battle. But Dara, ever haughty and over-confident in his military abilities, brushed off his father's offer. The calm eldest sister,

Jahanara, also intervened, writing to Aurangzeb that 'according to the Islamic law and convention the elder brother has the status of a father. His Majesty holds the same view.' But this was a flawed argument. The *shari'a* has no law of primogeniture; moreover, as everybody knew, the Turko-Mongol tradition as refined by Akbar gave all sons of a reigning monarch an equal right to inherit the empire. So Aurangzeb wrote to his father, protesting that whereas he merely wished to visit His Majesty, Dara had mobilized a vast army to prevent his progress towards Agra.<sup>38</sup>

But the time for meaningful negotiations had passed. The brothers were bent on war, and on 29 May their armies clashed near the village of Samugarh, thirty-five kilometres south-east of Agra. Although Dara's forces of 60,000 far surpassed in number those of Aurangzeb and Murad, his men, unlike the invaders from Gujarat and the Deccan, had been hastily assembled and were not at all battle-hardened. Worse, some of his leading officers secretly supported Aurangzeb. The battle's progress therefore proved disastrous for Dara, whose forces were swept off the field by late afternoon. The prince himself galloped off to Agra. Too ashamed to face his father after his crushing defeat, a dispirited Dara slipped out of the fort that same night and headed towards Delhi with a handful of supporters. Next came days of tortuous negotiations between Aurangzeb, who now held most of the political cards, and Shah Jahan, still in his palace in Agra but suddenly reduced to the pitiable state of an emperor with no empire. Acting as intermediary, Jahanara conveyed to Aurangzeb the emperor's last-ditch proposal to divide the empire among his four sons.<sup>39</sup> But it was too late for such ideas: the princes all understood that this was a winner-take-all contest. Nonetheless, a direct face-to-face interview between the drama's principal actors was arranged. Aurangzeb had actually saddled up and was riding towards the Agra fort to meet his father when he was handed an intercepted message from Shah Jahan to Dara, in which the emperor advised his eldest son to collect an army in Delhi and stay there while he concluded his negotiations with Aurangzeb. Such evidence of his father's continued collusion with

Dara convinced Aurangzeb that he was walking into a trap. So he aborted the intended interview and instead ordered his men to take possession of all royal effects, treasures and so on, and to keep the emperor confined in the palace.<sup>40</sup> Until his death seven years later, Shah Jahan would never again leave the fort.

By 10 June 1658 the War of Succession was effectively over. On that day Aurangzeb felt sufficiently confident of his tightening grip on power to hold in his camp a grand *darbar*, or public audience, where, though not yet crowned, he behaved as though he were already sovereign, presenting himself for public viewing, receiving hosts of courtiers and making appointments. But two obstacles blocked any easy transition to the Peacock Throne. The first was political. Of his three brothers, two were at large – Dara in Delhi, reportedly reassembling an army to challenge the outcome at Samugarh; and Shuja' in Bengal, checked by a Mughal army four months earlier, but said to be preparing to resume his bid for power. Though courageous and successful in combat, his younger brother, Murad, was impetuous, gullible and increasingly unhappy about his role of playing second fiddle to Aurangzeb. Since Murad was near at hand, he was the first to be dealt with. Three days after his *darbar* in Agra, Aurangzeb set off for Delhi in pursuit of Dara, with Murad and his army tagging along several kilometres behind. On the pretext of celebrating their joint victory over Dara, Aurangzeb treacherously invited the unsuspecting Murad to a sumptuous feast, after which his guest was shackled in his slumber and ultimately dispatched to the Mughals' state prison in Gwalior.

Dara, however, would remain a fugitive for the next fourteen months, his condition growing ever more desperate and miserable. Armies that he hastily assembled on the run, using treasures he had either carried with him or seized from former political servants, dwindled progressively towards the vanishing point. Aurangzeb pursued his quarry to Lahore and then to Multan, which he reached in mid September 1658. But Dara stayed just ahead of him, continuing down the Indus valley with an army that rapidly shrank from 14,000 in Lahore to just 3,000. In Multan, Aurangzeb learnt that

Shuja', realizing that none of his brothers was occupying Agra or Delhi, had left his base in Bengal and was again marching up the Ganges valley. So Aurangzeb abruptly rushed back to Delhi and thence to what is now Faizabad District, Uttar Pradesh, where he joined the army of his old ally Mir Jumla. At the Battle of Khajwa on 5 January 1659, the allies confronted and defeated Shuja', who for the next four months, pursued by Mir Jumla, fell back into the Bengal forests and finally fled to Burma's Arakan coastal region, where he vanished from historical record.

That left only Dara for Aurangzeb to contend with. While Shuja' was being driven through Bengal, the eldest contender experienced a brief comeback. Having crossed the salt marshes between Sind and Gujarat, he found support for a renewed attempt on the crown in Ahmedabad. Maharaja Jaswant Singh had first fought on Dara's behalf at Dharmat, then switched to supporting Aurangzeb, but then deserted the latter at Khajwa. Now he again offered to help Dara. Although the fugitive prince might have thought better of relying on one with such fickle loyalties, the man was desperate, and so in February 1659 he marched north expecting Jaswant Singh's army to join his own remnants at Ajmer. By the time he got there, though, Aurangzeb had already cautioned the Rajput general against supporting his brother. Like most other Mughal nobles, Jaswant Singh clearly saw which prince it was more prudent to back, and so abandoned Dara to his fate. In mid March Dara bravely staged one last stand at Deorai, just south of Ajmer, but Rajputs fighting with Aurangzeb ultimately outmanoeuvred him. Pursued this time by Maharaja Jai Singh, Dara fled back to Gujarat, retracing his steps across the salt marsh to southern Sind. Reduced to a band of hardly a hundred followers, Dara headed north hoping to find support in Afghanistan. But in early June, near the mouth of the Bolan Pass, a *zamindar* whom Dara thought he could trust betrayed him to Aurangzeb's men, and in August he was taken to Delhi in chains. There he was publicly paraded through the streets and bazaars of Shahjahanabad, wearing coarse cloth and mounted on a miserable, worn-out elephant. François Bernier, who witnessed the spectacle, remarked on the public weeping and lamenting for Dara's wretched

fate. Yet nobody made any move to rescue the doomed prince, despite there being hardly any troops guarding him.<sup>41</sup> After a council of clerics drew up a list of charges against him, he was executed on 30 August 1659, and his body was buried in the grounds of Humayun's tomb.<sup>42</sup>

On 13 May, three months before Dara's execution, but several months after that prince's last stand at Deorai, Aurangzeb had staged a grand coronation ceremony in Delhi, officially inaugurating his reign [see Fig. 20].<sup>43</sup> He chose as his imperial title "Alamgir' ('world-conqueror'), apparently in memory of a sword, inscribed with that title, that his father had given him after the decisive Battle of Samugarh a year earlier. 44

## 'ALAMGIR'S EARLY REIGN

Having trod his bloody path to the Peacock Throne, the new emperor moved swiftly to consolidate his power and assert his claims to legitimacy. First, he richly rewarded the nobles who had aided him during the two years' struggle and pardoned those who had supported any of his brothers. To maintain administrative continuity with Shah Jahan's regime, he retained his father's last finance minister, Raja Raghunath, whom he repeatedly praised for his dedication and competence. To neutralize factions within his immediate family, he arranged marriages between his own children and those of his defeated brothers: two of his daughters were married to Dara's son Sipihr Shukoh and Murad's son 'Izzat Bakhsh after both were released from prison and given official ranks, while his own son Muhammad A'zam was married to Dara's daughter Jani Begum. His success in consolidating his authority is seen in the response to his own serious illness just three years into his reign. Although physicians despaired of his recovery, no prince or noble made any move to restore the still-confined Shah Jahan to power, far less wage another succession war on his own behalf.<sup>45</sup>

For the common population, which had been greatly unsettled by the recent political convulsions, 'Alamgir acted with predictable

generosity. 'The doors of the imperial treasuries were opened to all people,' writes a chronicler, adding that the new emperor celebrated his next birthday by indulging in the traditional Indian custom of having himself weighed against gold, which was distributed among the poor. <sup>46</sup> To alleviate suffering from famine, he opened ten additional almshouses in Delhi, twelve more in surrounding districts, and still more in Lahore.<sup>47</sup> Indicating his determination to serve justice, he ordered the public execution of 500 common thieves.<sup>48</sup> For the benefit of merchants, he abolished road tolls on the transit of grain throughout the realm, despite a considerable loss of revenue to the state.<sup>49</sup> And he threw himself into the minutiae of everyday administration with boundless energy. 'Above all,' writes Manucci, 'he prided himself on the number of hours he spent every day in public audience, in the hearing of complaints, and in efforts to suppress the abuses existing in the empire.'<sup>50</sup>

The new emperor also embarked on a vigorous programme of imperial expansion on three frontiers. To the east, where Mughal armies had long since adapted themselves to campaigning in the river-laced forests of the great Ganges delta, 'Alamgir sent his new governor of Bengal, Mir Jumla, up the Brahmaputra River towards Assam. In late 1661 his naval flotillas reached the provincial capital of the Ahom rajas in Kuch Bihar and annexed the surrounding territory. Early the following year his forces continued moving upriver, taking riverside forts one by one, up to the Ahom capital of Garhgaon, which fell to Mir Jumla in March 1662. But torrential rains and poor communication with Dhaka, followed by famine and disease in the imperial camp, forced the Mughals to reach a tributary arrangement with the Ahom raja, similar to those that had been concluded with Rajput chieftains since the days of Akbar. In early 1663 the expeditionary force began its return to Dhaka, but Mir Jumla died en route. Within four years the Ahom kings had renewed the war, pushing Mughal garrisons out of Assam. Despite the Mughals' subsequent attempts to reconquer the upper Brahmaputra valley, by 1681 they had been driven out of Gauhati and Assam for good.

'Alamgir's forces had better luck extending the empire's frontiers in Bengal's south-eastern sector. In 1459 one of the delta's oldest and finest seaports, Chittagong, had been seized from the Bengal sultans by the kings of the Arakan coast. Jahangir's governor in Bengal, Islam Khan Chishti, had managed to recover Bengali territory up to the Feni River seventy kilometres north of Chittagong, but the port itself remained under Arakanese control. What is more, that city was being used as a staging site for Arakanese mariners and renegade Portuguese adventurers to raid lower Bengal for slaves. Therefore, Mir Jumla's successor as Bengal governor, Shaista Khan, renovated the provincial navy, building 300 new boats in order to launch a combined naval and overland expedition to conquer Chittagong. After first seizing the island of Sandwip, in early 1666 a Mughal force of 6,500 wrested the port from the Arakanese, whose capital of Mrauk-U further down the coast had just entered a period of internal disorder, rendering them unable to recover it.

Recalling his father's disastrous campaigns to subdue northern Afghanistan, 'Alamgir adopted more limited goals for the empire's north-western frontier. Protecting vital trade routes, not annexing territory, would be the strategic objective. He also reached political accommodations with the Pashtun clans inhabiting the rugged mountains beyond the Khyber Pass. Early in 'Alamgir's reign, though, several tribal uprisings tested imperial resolve and methods. In 1667, a chieftain of the Yusufzai lineage crowned himself king of the Swat valley and led his tribesmen across the Indus near Attock, attacking government outposts and threatening routes leading into Kashmir. Mughal counter-attacks only drew more frontier tribes into the uprising, which was finally suppressed by Mir Jumla's son, Muhammad Amin Khan. Then in 1672 another lineage, the Afridis, rose up under Acmal Khan, who also crowned himself king, struck coins and declared war on the Mughals. This uprising was more serious, since it was proclaimed in the name of all Pashtuns. Muhammad Amin Khan, now governor of Kabul, recklessly took a huge army into a dangerous part of the Khyber Pass where Afridi tribes ambushed his force, killing 10,000 and enslaving another 20,000. Two years later the Mughals suffered another reverse, in

which Indian troops unaccustomed to Afghanistan's bitterly cold winters got caught in the snowy pass leading to Kabul and were again ambushed with heavy losses. After this, 'Alamgir advanced to the Peshawar region, where he spent more than a year personally overseeing Mughal operations. Shrewdly pitting clan against clan, he won over tribal chieftains with gifts, lavish subsidies and promises of productive *jagir*s if they would enter Mughal service. Such policies did stabilize the north-west: Pashtun tribes were mostly pacified, and the caravan routes leading from the Punjab to the Iranian plateau remained open.

On the other hand, 'Alamgir's policies regarding two major Rajput houses – the Rathors of Marwar in western Rajasthan and the Sisodiyas of Mewar in the south – seriously strained Delhi's relations with these long-standing Mughal allies. By mutual agreements, the emperors reserved the right to choose the ruling successor to any Rajput house with which they were tied by treaty, and by custom those choices would conform to Rajput expectations. Problems could arise, however, when a Rajput house was sharply divided over a rightful successor. In late 1678 such a crisis was touched off when Jaswant Singh, raja of Marwar, died with no surviving heir. Indra Singh, a grandson of Jaswant Singh's disinherited elder brother, immediately advanced his claims for the succession, although his candidacy was widely opposed by Rathor clansmen. Word then arrived that in February 1679 a male child named Ajit Singh had been born to one of Jaswant Singh's wives. Not wishing to put Marwar under a regency until the boy had attained majority, 'Alamgir ordered the child placed under imperial custody while naming Indra Singh the state's new raja. Many in Marwar, however, fiercely resisted the emperor's measures, insisting that succession be restricted to direct heirs. They also rejected the emperor's compromise proposal to partition the state between the infant Ajit Singh and Indra Singh. In July 1679 Durga Das, a leading Rathor chieftain, kidnapped Ajit Singh from imperial custody in Delhi and dashed off to Jodhpur, Marwar's capital, where the child was acclaimed the next Rathor raja. Since such defiance of imperial authority amounted to rebellion, in September 1679 'Alamgir moved

the imperial court to Ajmer while his troops, following a precedent established in other Rajput states in such circumstances, occupied Jodhpur. The entire kingdom was placed under direct Mughal administration, pending resolution of the succession issue. The emperor also sent in imperial agents to prepare inventories of Jaswant Singh's estate, since the property of any Mughal noble automatically reverted to the state upon his death.

The uprising did not remain confined to Marwar, however. With the Mughals occupying the Rathor capital of Jodhpur, Durga Das with the infant Ajit Singh took refuge in neighbouring Mewar, then ruled by Rana Raj Singh.<sup>51</sup> In response, in November 1679 'Alamgir personally invaded Mewar only to find the Sisodiya capital of Udaipur vacated, as Rana Raj Singh and his entire cavalry had abandoned the plains for the hills. After nearly a year of Mughal–Sisodiya military stalemate, Raj Singh died and was succeeded by Jai Singh, who opposed his clan's continued involvement in the Rathor succession struggle and negotiated a separate peace with 'Alamgir. The emperor, in turn, confirmed Jai Singh in his position as Mewar's raja and made him an imperial *mansabdar* with the rank of 5,000. For the rest of 'Alamgir's reign Mughal relations with Mewar remained cordial, with Sisodiya commanders and troops once again taking up imperial service throughout the empire.<sup>52</sup> Meanwhile the Rathors of Marwar wearily came to accept rule by Mughal governors. But their relations remained strained, as Durga Das kept up a guerrilla resistance for another two decades, albeit with only desultory support from his kinsmen. Ultimately, by 1699 both Durga Das and Ajit Singh, by then an adult, had submitted to Mughal rule and become imperial *mansabdar*s, formally ending Marwar's rebellion against 'Alamgir. <sup>53</sup> But the long struggle had created an air of mutual distrust that lingered for decades.

The Rajput rebellion also led to 'Alamgir's fateful decision not to return to Delhi, but to continue south and conduct military operations in the Deccan. These operations would occupy his remaining twentyfive years of life and permanently alter the course of Mughal history. At the height of the Rajput rebellion, in mid 1680, the emperor had

given the command of military campaigns in southern Marwar to his favourite son, Prince Akbar. But the prince, flushed with several battlefield victories and knowing how his father had usurped power from Shah Jahan, made the rash decision to confront 'Alamgir for the Mughal throne. In this he was urged on by 'Alamgir's erstwhile enemies, Durga Das and Rana Raj Singh, who assured him that all Rajputs would certainly rally to his cause. So in early 1681 Akbar, accompanied by his newfound Rajput allies and addled by visions of the gem-studded Peacock Throne, declared himself emperor and marched the 200 kilometres to his father's camp in Ajmer. On the eve of the battle, however, 'Alamgir tricked the Rajputs into believing that Akbar was actually leading them into a trap. As a result, the prince awoke at dawn to find that all his Rajput allies had vanished, leaving him with just a few hundred men to face his furious father. Hastily backtracking, the prince caught up with Durga Das, who was dismayed to learn that 'Alamgir had wiped an entire army off the field without shooting a single arrow. Finding that the Rajputs had no appetite for battling 'Alamgir, Durga Das, together with Prince Akbar, marched south seeking asylum with any anti-Mughal community they could find.

They found that community south of the Vindhya Mountains, where anti-Mughal sentiment had been brewing for several decades. For his part, 'Alamgir had greater plans than merely capturing his rebel son. Back in 1658, before leaving the Deccan to join the War of Succession, he had been on the cusp of annexing both Bijapur and Golconda and checking the nascent power of Maratha chieftains. For more than two decades as emperor, he continued to view these projects as unfinished business. Now, with his rebel son having fled into the arms of one of those adversaries, he had one more reason to pack his tents and, together with the entire court and a good part of the army, shift to the Deccan.

#### EMERGING IDENTITIES: THE MARATHAS FROM SHAHJI TO TARABAI

As they crossed the Vindhyas and entered the Marathi-speaking western Deccan, Durga Das and Prince Akbar encountered a political culture very different from the Rajput world they had left behind. By the seventeenth century, sovereign territories in Rajasthan were dominated by members of a single Rajput lineage that claimed descent from a common conqueror–ancestor. Land was parcelled out to *sardar*s, who were hereditary leaders of sub-clans and loyal to the clan's ruler, or raja, who was supposed to be the nearest legitimate descendant in direct male line from the state's conqueror–ancestor, and the firstborn of his generation. Because all clan members were morally obliged to support the raja in times of war, and because by this time they had absorbed the martial ideology of the *kshatriya* warrior class, the constituent members of Rajput states could be readily mobilized for collective action, political or military. By 'Alamgir's day, moreover, most Rajput states had submitted to the Mughal empire, symbolized by a raja's acknowledging the emperor's right to apply a vermilion *tika* to his forehead – itself a Rajput political ritual – and by attending the Mughal court. The Rajputs' hierarchically structured polities thus allowed the Mughals access to considerable military manpower, since the submission of any given raja implied that of his entire clan.

The political world of the Marathi-speaking Deccan was very different. Although united since at least the fourteenth century by a common vernacular language and a growing corpus of devotional literature, the mainly agrarian society of the western plateau was fractured politically into *pargana*s, each one comprising twenty to 100 villages. Each *pargana* was controlled by a *deshmukh*, who adjudicated disputes, collected revenue and provided local security by maintaining his own retainers and controlling one or more of the hundreds of fortified strongholds that dot the western Deccan's hilly landscape. However, unlike in Rajput states, where a single clan was displaced spatially across a large territory, and where all *sardar*s swore loyalty to their raja and claimed descent from a common ancestor–warrior, a *deshmukh*'s political loyalty to anyone beyond his own *desh*, or land, was contractual, not kin-based, and was directed to whichever sultan or warlord could offer him the best deal.

In politically volatile times, *deshmukh*s of the western Deccan looked more like 'high-risk rural entrepreneurs and negotiators' than paid bureaucrats.<sup>54</sup> And the mid seventeenth century was an especially volatile time. As the sultanates of the western Deccan were rapidly disintegrating, Maratha *deshmukh*s formerly tied to those kingdoms had to make risky choices about whom to negotiate with and whose patronage to accept. By 1636 the Nizam Shahi sultanate of Ahmadnagar had already dissolved, its territories divided between the Mughals and the 'Adil Shahi sultanate of Bijapur. Then, in the 1650s and 1660s, Bijapur itself entered a period of decay from which it never recovered.

Amidst this fragmented political environment a new polity emerged in the Marathi-speaking western plateau. Its founder, the charismatic and politically gifted Maratha chieftain Shivaji Bhonsle (1630–80), repeatedly used courage and savvy to outmanoeuvre his adversaries. His ancestral roots, like those of most *deshmukh* families, were embedded in the Deccan's sultanate systems. Shivaji's grandfather, Maloji, had been in the service of Malik Ambar, the powerful Habshi ex-slave and *vazir* of the Nizam Shahi sultanate who held off Jahangir's repeated invasions of the Deccan between 1605 and 1626. Malik Ambar had given land in the western Deccan's Sholapur and Pune region to Maloji's son Shahji, who first tried to prop up the collapsing Nizam Shahi sultanate after Malik Ambar's death, and then briefly entered Shah Jahan's service as a *mansabdar*, before finally defecting to Bijapur in 1636. Leaving his wife and young son Shivaji on his ancestral lands near Pune, Shahji led several 'Adil Shahi military expeditions deep into the southern Deccan, making Bangalore his base. Meanwhile, in 1647 the seventeen-year-old Shivaji used a stratagem to seize the fort of Torna. From the treasure found there he built the fort of Raigarh, from which Bijapur's forces failed to dislodge him. Throughout the early 1650s, while the state of Bijapur was distracted by war with Golconda and the illness of its sultan, Shivaji quietly recruited ever more *deshmukh*s and their retainers to his cause. In 1656 he challenged and defeated in battle the powerful *deshmukh* Chandra

Rao More, which gave him access to the Konkan coast. He also acquired more treasure, with which he built another fort, Pratapgarh, in the Western Ghats.

The following year, 1657, Shivaji had his first interaction with Aurangzeb, then the governor of the Mughal Deccan. Recognizing that the Mughal empire, not Bijapur, was the more significant player with which to negotiate, the ambitious Maratha entrepreneur offered his military services to the Mughals if the latter would recognize his rights over the forts he had already seized. Aurangzeb agreed to these proposals, but not to Shivaji's audacious request for recognition of his control of coastal forts, such as Dabhol, that were still in 'Adil Shahi hands. Aurangzeb was already wary of the gathering power of this independent Maratha chieftain. By 1659, when all of north India was preoccupied with the War of Succession, Shivaji commanded a cavalry of 7,000 and controlled some forty forts in the mountains and along the Konkan coast. Meanwhile, Bijapur seized this moment of turmoil over Mughal succession to reassert its grip over its western tracts. In September 1659 that sultanate sent one of its leading generals, Afzal Khan, to punish Shivaji. But the upstart chieftain treacherously killed Afzal Khan during a negotiating session between the two men, after which his cavalrymen poured over the plateau and seized many forts, including Panhala, one of Bijapur's principal strongholds guarding the caravan routes between its capital and the Arabian Sea.<sup>55</sup> Shivaji's power and audacity had reached new heights.

Soon after Aurangzeb had won the throne, he sent his uncle, Shaista Khan, to reassert imperial authority in the Mughal Deccan. But in 1663 Shivaji made a daring night-time raid on the Mughal officer's camp, during which the khan was wounded and his son was killed. An infuriated 'Alamgir immediately recalled him. The next year Shivaji brazenly sacked the port of Surat, the Mughals' principal window on the Arabian Sea. The emperor responded in 1665 by sending his most trusted general, Jai Singh, the Kachhwaha raja of Amber, to the Deccan. After cornering the Maratha chief in his stronghold of Purandar, Jai Singh negotiated an agreement with

Shivaji whereby the latter would surrender twenty-three of his thirtyfive forts; join Mughal campaigns against Bijapur; give the Mughals a portion of plundered wealth from future conquests of Bijapuri assets; and agree to his son Sambhaji enrolling in Mughal service. Suspecting that the Maratha leader might renege on these provisions, Jai Singh proposed, and 'Alamgir agreed, that Shivaji and Sambhaji should personally appear at the imperial court in Agra. This set the stage for a bizarre spectacle. Wherever it was held, the Mughal court was carefully regulated with respect to protocol and hierarchy. On 12 May 1666, offended at having to stand in court among officers he considered beneath his stature (even though he held no Mughal rank at all), Shivaji made a public scene by falling to the floor, writhing like a wounded animal, then rising and audibly complaining, even threatening suicide.<sup>56</sup> He was immediately hustled out of the audience hall and placed under house arrest, lucky to have escaped with his life for committing such an egregious breach of courtly etiquette. But within several weeks he and his son had managed to escape, probably by bribing guards. Disguised as religious mendicants, they made the long journey back to the Deccan on foot, dodging Mughal patrols.

Shivaji's relations with the Mughals having reached an impasse, and with Bijapur weakened further when in 1672 a four-year-old boy succeeded to the throne, the Maratha chieftain resolved not only to declare his independence from both Bijapur and the Mughals, but also to fashion himself as an explicitly Hindu monarch, one of his titles being *haindava-dharmoddarakla*, 'protector of the Hindu faith'.<sup>57</sup> He would also be a *kshatriya* king, a warrior king according to India's ancient scheme of social hierarchy, thereby raising his moral authority above that of his fellow Marathas and the region's many *deshmukh* families. But this posed a problem. Shivaji's public fiasco at 'Alamgir's court at Agra was more than a breach of courtly protocol. Rajputs standing in his midst perceived him as distinctly alien. Jaswant Singh, the raja of the Rathor Rajputs of Marwar, dismissed him as 'a mere *bhumia*' (petty landholder).<sup>58</sup> To overcome such social barriers, Shivaji arranged for a celebrated

Brahmin from Benares, Gagabhat, to come to Maharashtra and authenticate the claim that his family was descended from lapsed Rajputs of the Sisodiya clan who had migrated from Mewar centuries earlier. With that accomplished, in June 1674 he sponsored a lavish and carefully choreographed coronation ceremony at Raigarh, in which he had himself invested with the sacred thread of the twiceborn castes, accompanied by elaborate purification rituals, Vedic verses and Brahmanical chants. While Shivaji sat on a golden throne covered with lion and tiger skins, Gagabhat raised the royal umbrella over his head, hailing him Śiva Chhatrapati. The extravagant ceremony, in which thousands of Brahmins were fed and given gifts, cost an estimated five million rupees.<sup>59</sup> The new monarch then embarked on military campaigns to the peninsula's deep south, seizing from Bijapur's control Vellore and Jinji in the Tamil country. Although his reign lasted only five years, he had established Maratha authority over much of the Konkan coast, the western plateau and parts of south India, bequeathing to his male descendants a new, independent polity.

Such was the changed political environment that 'Alamgir found upon his return to the Deccan in early 1682, twenty-four years after he had governed the region as a prince. In those earlier days, Bijapur had been under the firm rule of Sultan Muhammad 'Adil Shah, who commanded the loyalty of most of his client Maratha *deshmukh*s. But now, the 'Adil Shahi throne was occupied by a fourteen-year-old sovereign whose court was riven by feuding ethnopolitical factions, while Maratha *deshmukh*s formerly loyal to Bijapur had mostly gravitated to the Maratha state's political orbit. Moreover, the possibility of capturing the rebel Akbar disappeared when the prince, shortly after his father's arrival in the Deccan, sailed off to Iran, never to return to India. In these circumstances, the emperor endeavoured to mobilize Bijapur and Golconda into joining the Mughals against the Maratha kingdom. But, when his efforts failed owing to those kingdoms' covert collusion with the Marathas, he instead trained his sights on the two sultanates. Bijapur was the first to fall to the Mughals, which it did in 1686 after an eighteen-month

siege. A year later Golconda also fell, thanks to Mughal bribes to the fort's gatekeepers. The territories of both states were swiftly annexed and parcelled out to Mughal officers as *jagir*s.

The Maratha state, ruled since 1680 by Shivaji's first son Sambhaji, now felt the full brunt of Mughal arms. In early 1689 Sambhaji was captured, taken to 'Alamgir's camp and brutally executed. In the Maratha capital of Raigarh Shivaji's second son, Rajaram, was hastily crowned, but the kingdom's leaders, fearful for the young king's security with Mughal armies nearby, arranged for his escape to distant Jinji in the Tamil country. Just months later, Raigarh too fell to 'Alamgir. At this point it seemed that the Maratha state had been crushed. 'Alamgir had captured all Shivaji's remaining treasure, his resplendent golden coronation throne, all the government's records, and the royal horses and elephants. Although Rajaram had eluded their grasp, the Mughals did capture Sambhaji's nine-year-old son Shahu, whom 'Alamgir confined in his mobile court, where he was well treated. He would be raised in Persianate Mughal culture but not converted to Islam, to be saved in the emperor's chess game for future use as a political pawn, albeit a pawn who would ultimately become a king.

The year 1689 marked a turning point for Aurangzeb, for the empire and for India. With the two remaining Deccan sultanates extinguished, their territories annexed and the young Maratha state apparently nipped in the bud, 'Alamgir could easily have returned to north India as a victorious conqueror and, after an absence of ten years, resumed governing the empire from its historic heartland. He could also have taken with him Shivaji's magnificent golden throne as a trophy of war, not to mention the substantial treasure he had seized from Golconda. Some of his advisers actually recommended such a course of action. But in a momentous decision, 'Alamgir rejected such advice. Not only was he determined to complete his subjugation of the Maratha state by seizing Jinji and capturing the fugitive Rajaram; he also coveted the rich lands of southern Karnataka and the Tamil country, long in a state of anarchy since the decline first of Vijayanagara, then of Bijapur. For the next eight years, 1690–98, he would direct the long, laborious operations at

Jinji while camped in two sprawling tent cities, first at Galgali by the banks of the Krishna fifty-five kilometres south-west of Bijapur, and then at Machnur by the Bhima River between Sholapur and Pandharpur.

Dominating the Karnatak plain between Arcot and Tiruchirappalli, Jinji is an immense, triangular-shaped stronghold encompassing three steep and well-fortified hills encircled by walls stretching nearly five kilometres in circumference. The challenge of seizing it was given to Zulfiqar Khan, the same general who had brilliantly taken Raigarh. He was joined by the emperor's youngest and favourite son, Kam Bakhsh. But it was a vexed enterprise. The Mughal army soon became bogged down outside Jinji's massive walls, while Maratha cavalry sent down from Maharashtra frequently broke the long supply lines carrying funds, war matériel and vital communications from the emperor's camp. Months passed, followed by years. In 1693, in what appeared a possible restaging of the 1657–9 War of Succession, rumours spread that the emperor was on the verge of death, or had already died. This tempted Kam Bakhsh to patch up a secret settlement with Rajaram and plan a takeover of the imperial army. But the plot was discovered and the prince was sent up to 'Alamgir's camp to be disciplined. While four more years passed with no progress at the siege of Jinji, the emperor endeavoured to draw Maratha chiefs away from the moribund Maratha state by offering them hefty *mansab*s in Mughal service. Many of them agreed; others alternated between Mughal and Maratha service, depending on which side could give them the better deal; still other Maratha families were divided in their loyalties, with different members joining opposing sides.

In late 1697 the Maratha cause revived when dispirited Mughal officers at Jinji, anticipating the need to accommodate the Marathas once the ageing emperor had died, quietly allowed Rajaram to slip out of the fort, which shortly thereafter fell to the Mughals.<sup>60</sup> Reaching Maharashtra in early 1698, Rajaram began rebuilding his father's state, establishing a new capital at Satara and mounting counter-attacks against the Mughals in the northern Deccan. But his

efforts would be cut off by an early death, in 1700. Whereas several of his wives nobly committed the ancient rite of *sati*, hurling their bodies on the burning pyre of the deceased raja, two wives declined to do so, each one hoping that her infant son might succeed Rajaram as king. One of these wives was Tarabai, the proud and strong-willed daughter of Shivaji's former commander-in-chief, Hambir Rao Mohite [see Fig. 21]. In the early 1690s, when Rajaram was besieged in distant Jinji, Tarabai, still a teenager, had remained in Maharashtra acquiring administrative skills under the tutelage of senior Maratha officials. Now, following Rajaram's death, she boldly had the sacred thread ceremony performed for her four-year-old son, confirming his ritual status as a *kshatriya* warrior and revealing her intention to crown him king, with herself as regent. This she did in the remote hill fort of Vishalgarh. On hearing this news the Mughal camp was exultant. 'Alamgir ordered the beating of drums, and his officers congratulated each other, convinced, records the chronicler Khafi Khan, 'that it would not be difficult to overcome two young children and a helpless woman. They thought their enemy weak, contemptible, and helpless.'<sup>61</sup>

Though normally shrewd in evaluating his adversaries, 'Alamgir completely misjudged whom he was facing. But not so his adversaries. Prominent Maratha *deshmukh*s now rallied around the twenty-five-year-old Tarabai, recognizing her as the most likely remnant of Shivaji's family to salvage the kingdom's sagging fortunes, despite her gender. The Hindu officer and news writer Bhimsen, then in the Deccan in 'Alamgir's service, bluntly stated that Tarabai 'was a stronger ruler than her husband', adding that after Rajaram's death she 'became all in all and regulated things so well that not a single Maratha leader acted without her order'.<sup>62</sup> From nearby Goa, Portuguese officials referred to her as the 'queen of the Marathas'.<sup>63</sup> Even Khafi Khan, whose chronicle of 'Alamgir's reign glorifies the emperor, admitted that Tarabai showed great powers of command and government, which she had taken into her own hands. 'She won the hearts of her officers,' he wrote, 'and for all the struggles and schemes, the campaigns and sieges of Aurangzeb up

to the end of his reign, the power of the Mahrattas increased day by day.'<sup>64</sup>

Nor was Tarabai content with merely holding on to Maratha forts. Shortly before his death, her late husband Rajaram had marched out of Maharasthra into Khandesh and Berar, demanding in certain districts a quarter of the regular imperial revenues as protection money against plundering by his troops. Leaving local Mughal garrisons unharmed, Rajaram initiated a form of dual government in such districts, where the Mughals and Marathas effectively shared land revenues. Tarabai, in turn, built on this policy, expanding it geographically and streamlining it administratively. Very soon after Rajaram's death she boldly sent Maratha armies on military expeditions deep into Mughal domains to the north, well beyond the Deccan. In 1700, even while allowing 'Alamgir to seize some of her own forts, she dispatched 50,000 troops as far north as the Chanderi region in north-western Madhya Pradesh, nearly 1,000 kilometres from the Maratha headquarters in Satara. In 1702 she sent armies into Mughal Khandesh, Berar and Telangana. The next year she attacked cities in Khandesh and Malwa, and in 1706 her generals struck cities in Gujarat.<sup>65</sup> These were not merely raids. As Khafi Khan notes, her plan was to 'cast the anchor of permanence' wherever Marathi armies penetrated. This she did by allocating revenue districts among Maratha administrators, establishing Maratha revenue collectors in conquered districts, and encouraging Maratha invaders to settle down in these districts with their families.<sup>66</sup> Tarabai's energetic leadership not only rescued the Maratha state from disintegration. In her northern invasions she sought to extend that state well beyond the Marathi-speaking Deccan. By striking deep into the Mughal heartland, she anticipated policies her Maratha successors would adopt later in the eighteenth century.

Meanwhile, 'Alamgir's armies continued to plod from fort to fort across the Deccan, trying to mow down the revived Maratha state one fort at a time. But the two sides were asymmetrically matched. Adapted to fighting pitched battles on the flat north Indian plain,

'Alamgir's huge armies lumbered across the plateau with their weighty artillery and heavy cavalry. In 1695 the Mughal camp at Galgali, by the Krishna, measured about fifty kilometres in circumference and contained 60,000 cavalry, 100,000 infantry, 50,000 camels, 3,000 elephants, 250 bazaars and another several hundred thousand servants, merchants and hangers-on. <sup>67</sup> Theirs was hardly an agile or mobile fighting machine. After laboriously taking one fort, a Mughal army would move to another, only to have the first one fall to the Marathas again. Their adversaries, by contrast, avoided pitched battles in the open. Taking advantage of their homeland's hilly terrain, the Marathas used guerrilla tactics that maximized the effectiveness of their swift, light cavalry, luring Mughal units into tight ravines, ambushing Mughal supply caravans and intercepting imperial communications.

The Mughal effort was plagued by other, internal problems. As 'Alamgir approached his ninetieth year of age and his fiftieth year as emperor, many of his veteran generals were dying, leaving him with flattering upstarts much too intimidated by the stubborn octogenarian to dare suggest a change of policy. Petty quarrels and jealousies within his corps of commanders further reduced the Mughals' effectiveness. In this dismal situation 'Alamgir did what came naturally to him: instead of leaving field command to his generals, from 1699 to 1705 he personally oversaw many siege operations. Like the Fool in Shakespeare's *King Lear*, who witnessed his aged lord rage on a barren heath and descend into madness, 'Alamgir's advisers seem to have understood the futility of it all. Bhimsen wrote, 'Emperor Alamgir who is not in want of anything, has been seized with such a longing and passion for taking forts that he personally runs about panting for some heaps of stone [hill forts].'<sup>68</sup>

It was while conducting one of his siege operations – fruitlessly 'panting for some heaps of stone' – that the emperor, a lifelong workaholic, was finally forced to abandon active military campaigning. In early 1706, in the grip of a severe illness, he was loaded on to a palanquin and carried to the ancient fort of Ahmadnagar, which he declared his 'journey's end'. He died there

the following year. Characteristically, he rejected the idea of a grand, ostentatious tomb of the sort that towered over the graves of all his Mughal ancestors save Babur. Instead, he arranged to be buried in a simple grave open to the sky in Khuldabad, a saintly graveyard near Daulatabad. In this final statement, spoken through the medium of architecture, the austere monarch asserted both his personal piety and his lifelong resolve to fashion a legitimacy – and now a legacy – firmly opposed to that of his father. If Shah Jahan had cultivated the aura of a resplendent king, notes one historian, 'Alamgir cultivated one of a renunciate king<sup>69</sup> – a contrast captured for ever in his father's Taj Mahal and in his own humble grave site.

In some ways 'Alamgir's career eerily echoed that of Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq. A little more than three centuries before Prince Aurangzeb waged successful campaigns in the Deccan, adding new territories to the Mughal empire, Prince Ulugh Khan had led prolonged campaigns in the plateau, successfully adding large tracts of territory to the Delhi sultanate. In 1325 he returned to Delhi and promptly usurped the throne from his father, becoming Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq. In 1658 Prince Aurangzeb would follow the same path to supreme power. And just as Muhammad bin Tughluq returned to the peninsula towards the end of his reign, never again to see Delhi and destined to spend his last years doggedly trudging from camp to camp, taking personal command of day-to-day military operations while pursuing rebels who ever eluded his grasp, 'Alamgir suffered the same fate. Both men died in the field, far from Delhi. And for both men, prolonged absence from Delhi where day-to-day administration lacked their personal supervision, combined with the drain on the state's treasury owing to costly wars waged far to the south, placed severe stresses on the fiscal and ultimately political stability of their respective empires. As Mark Twain reputedly said: 'History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.'

#### 'ONE POMEGRANATE TO SERVE A HUNDRED SICK MEN'

The last fifteen years of 'Alamgir's reign had seen a bidding war between the emperor and Maratha leaders to court and win the

service of powerful *deshmukh*s. Whereas the Marathas could appeal to the legacy of Shivaji or loyalty to the land and culture of Maharashtra, 'Alamgir offered the prestige that came with serving an India-wide empire, and, especially, a high rank in imperial service. For each new *mansab* rank, officials in the Mughal revenue bureaucracy had to find, somewhere in the empire, one or more *jagir*s whose revenue matched a *mansabdar*'s assigned pay. As long as the empire kept acquiring more taxable territory through conquest, there was always land to be made available for assignment as *jagir*s. This additional land could then be granted either to *mansabdar*s who had been promoted to higher *mansab*s or to people newly recruited into the nobility.

In the 1680s, 'Alamgir had induced many powerful nobles of Bijapur and Golconda to abandon those sultanates by offering them high *mansab*s in Mughal service. By 1691 such nobles comprised fully 160 out of the total of 575 Mughal officers holding *mansab*s of 1000 *zat* or higher. That amounted to 28 per cent of the empire's upper nobility. <sup>70</sup> Initially, these men were given *jagir*s in the Deccan itself, but this proved inadequate since the expected revenue for the region had been inflated far beyond its actual capacity. Moreover, the land itself had been ravaged by decades of warfare, as armies devoured the harvest of fields like swarms of locusts. Nor had newly conquered lands in the Karnatak, or the southern Deccan, yet been brought under Mughal control. As a result, it became increasingly necessary to accommodate newly recruited Deccani nobles by assigning them wealth-producing *jagir*s in north India. But this created further problems. Because the imperial domain had not been expanding in north India since 'Alamgir had permanently moved to the Deccan, there were few fresh *jagir*s to distribute to these new nobles. The only practical solution was to reduce or revoke altogether *jagir*s held by the empire's old, established nobility. However, any policy that effectively disenfranchised older sections of the nobility to accommodate new nobles amounted to 'robbing Peter to pay Paul'. In short, there was insufficient unclaimed land to meet the growing demand for *jagir*s owing to the recruitment of new

nobles. Or, as the emperor repeatedly, and poetically, wrote on the registers of those claiming new salaries, 'There is only one pomegranate to serve a hundred sick men [*yek anar, sad bimar*].'<sup>71</sup>

This situation worsened after Bijapur and Golconda had been conquered and, after 1689, when 'Alamgir began recruiting Marathas by promising them lucrative *mansab*s as inducements for enlisting in Mughal service. Here again the policy met with success, but only in a narrow sense. In the final twenty-five years of his reign, Marathas comprised 17 per cent of the empire's upper nobility, actually exceeding the Rajputs, who constituted 12.6 per cent.<sup>72</sup> But the influx of these men created problems. First, their loyalty was unreliable. 'Alamgir evidently thought he could deal with Marathas just as Mughal emperors since Akbar had dealt with Rajputs. But, in contrast to the Rajputs, the submission of a Maratha chieftain did not imply that of his entire clan. Furthermore, a deep cultural divide separated north India's Persianized martial classes from the warrior elites of the Deccan, most prominently Telugu *nayaka*s and Maratha *deshmukh*s. This was not a religious issue. Many Rajputs disparaged Maratha chiefs, just as Jaswant Singh had dismissed them as 'mere *bhumia*s'.

The greater problem with 'Alamgir's policy, however, was structural. To pay for the Deccan wars, 'Alamgir classified much of the Deccan's conquered territory as crown land (*khalisa*), whose revenues went directly to the treasury and not to *mansabdar*s in the form of *jagir*s. In north India, fewer *jagir*s were available because so many of them had already been given to Deccanis. All this placed severe strain on the military and fiscal systems and, ultimately, the political system. As *jagir*s became increasingly scarce, it grew more difficult to sustain the established practice of regularly transferring *mansabdar*s every three or four years. Once a *mansabdar* received his transfer notice, he might have to wait four or five years before the revenue bureaucracy could find another *jagir* for him, which meant four or five years without a revenue stream with which to pay his troops.<sup>73</sup> To expedite the transfer process, wealthier and more established *mansabdar*s could employ agents to lobby bureaucrats

on their behalf, or simply resort to bribing such functionaries. But *mansabdar*s who lacked the means to hire agents or bribe officials were left with nothing. In this way corruption crept into an administrative machine that had operated relatively smoothly ever since Akbar's day. The emperor was well aware of this problem: late in his reign he took the radical step of banning altogether the recruitment of new *mansabdar*s.

But by then it was too late. Although the system did not totally collapse in 'Alamgir's reign, all the factors leading to such an outcome were firmly in place. Ultimately, established nobles would simply ignore orders for the transfer of their *jagir*s, since they knew very well that, if they relinquished their hold on their existing *jagir*s, new ones might never be assigned to them. Within a decade of the emperor's death, orders of *jagir* transfers had become mere sheets of paper, as rulers far less disciplined than 'Alamgir continued granting *mansab*s with no corresponding *jagir* to pay for the rank.<sup>74</sup> In short, the entire fiscal–political structure was approaching collapse.

#### RELIGION AND SOVEREIGNTY UNDER 'ALAMGIR

In his personal habits, 'Alamgir was notoriously austere and abstemious – traits which converted into a religious sensibility that was pious to the point of puritanical. When he was a prince, some regarded this as an affectation fashioned to mask a secret ambition to power. <sup>75</sup> During his struggle to win the Peacock Throne, his piety served to distance him both from the lavish indulgences of his father – whom one modern historian calls a 'glorified jeweler' <sup>76</sup> – and the religious adventurism of his elder brother Dara. Further defining his religious posture were the events surrounding his actual accession to supreme power. This was because the crisis of 1657–9 was not a typical Turko-Mongol, or even Mughal war of succession in which the princes and their armies engaged in an armed struggle over a vacant throne. The problem this time was that Shah Jahan had not died, even though it was widely believed when war broke out that he already had, or that his death was imminent. By November 1657,

just two months after he fell ill, the stricken emperor had fully recovered. By that time, though, military orders had already been issued, armies had been mobilized, one son had already crowned himself, and another would follow suit a month later. The customary machinery for replacing a deceased sovereign having been set in motion, the inevitable struggle had to be played out to the full, until the drama's final curtain would come down with a new emperor formally installed on the Peacock Throne.

For his part, Prince Aurangzeb had left the Deccan for Delhi genuinely believing that Shah Jahan was at the point of death, if not already dead. But, by the time he reached Agra and found his father in good health, what had begun as a war of succession – he had already defeated Dara's armies twice – suddenly became an act of usurpation, and the usurpation of another person's land or property is prohibited in Islamic law. <sup>77</sup> For a man professing strict observance of that law, the newly crowned emperor suddenly found himself in an untenable position, the more so when experts on canon law refused to sanction his seizure of power since the lawful sovereign, his own father, was still living. In this circumstance Aurangzeb solicited the opinion of 'Abd al-Wahhab, the former *qazi* of Patan, Gujarat, who obligingly decreed that since Shah Jahan was physically unfit to govern (despite evidence to the contrary), the throne was virtually vacant. Aurangzeb's accession as 'Alamgir had therefore not violated Islamic law. As a reward for this valuable hermeneutic service, 'Abd al-Wahhab was made the empire's chief *qazi*; he would go on to become one of the most corrupt chief judges in Mughal history. 78

The nature of 'Alamgir's rise to supreme power – a bloody usurpation accompanied by the elimination of his brothers and the confinement of his father – had far-reaching consequences. Notwithstanding 'Abd al-Wahhab's whitewashing of the process, the emperor craved legitimacy in the eyes of the wider Islamic world, for which purpose he sought the blessings of the guardian of the holiest shrines in the Muslim world, the Sharif of Mecca.<sup>79</sup> In 1659, shortly after his grand coronation, he sent a considerable sum of money to

the Sharif, to be distributed to the needy there. But to his dismay, the authorities in Mecca turned down his gift for the same reason his own jurists had initially rejected his claims to the throne – that he could not legally be sovereign as long as his father was still alive.<sup>80</sup> Undeterred, several years later he sent gifts valued at 660,000 rupees to the Sharif.<sup>81</sup> Finally, in 1666, shortly after Shah Jahan had died, the Sharif sent 'Alamgir a belated congratulations on his accession, together with a sacred relic – the broom and some dust from the Prophet Muhammad's tomb in Medina – which the emperor received with much solemnity. 82

'Alamgir's relations with his family also influenced his religious posture. During and after the hard-fought succession struggle, it became politically necessary to magnify the differences between himself and Dara Shukoh. In contrast to his elder brother, whom he publicly portrayed as a deviant backslider whose execution was justified partly on religious grounds, Aurangzeb projected himself as a correct Muslim. With Shah Jahan he ratcheted up this posture still higher. In bitter written exchanges with his father, confined to his palace in Agra, the new emperor self-righteously posed as the champion of Islam, stressing that Dara had usurped power and promoted Hinduism during their father's illness. He even claimed that his own victories at Dharmat and Samugarh demonstrated divine sanction for his enterprise.<sup>83</sup> Accordingly, soon after his coronation he ceased participating in courtly functions that conflicted with his understanding of Islam, such as celebrating the Persian New Year's Day (Nauruz), patronizing music and art, appearing at the *jharokha* at sunrise, applying *tika* on the foreheads of subordinate kings, or having himself weighed against gold or silver on his birthday. His abstention from music appears to have been a personal matter that was not imposed on others.<sup>84</sup> Other measures, such as prohibiting gambling or consuming alcohol, were intended to extend beyond the court, but they were blatantly ignored even by his closest courtiers.<sup>85</sup>

To the wider public, meanwhile, he sought to justify – or perhaps atone for – his violent path to power by presenting himself in the guise of a pious and beneficent ruler in the mould of a sultan of Delhi

such as Iltutmish or Muhammad bin Tughluq. He ordered that the Islamic confession of faith not appear on Mughal coins, lest the sacred words be intentionally or inadvertently defaced. He replaced the public celebration of the Persian New Year (Nauruz) with that of 'Eid al-Fitr, the feast that ends the fasting in the Muslim month of Ramazan. And he established the office of public censor (*muhtisib*), an official charged with enforcing fairness in the marketplace.<sup>86</sup> He also ordered the abolition of custom duties previously levied on Muslim merchants, leaving in place those imposed on Hindu traders.<sup>87</sup> However, local authorities in Gujarat largely ignored the order and, even when it was briefly enforced, Hindu merchants simply arranged for complicit Muslims to handle their goods for them.<sup>88</sup> Referring to non-Muslim religious practices performed in public, the French physician François Bernier, who visited India during 'Alamgir's first decade of rule, noted that, once in power, 'the Great *Mogol*, though a *Mahometan*, permits these ancient and superstitious practices; not wishing, or not daring, to disturb the *Gentiles* [Hindus] in the free exercises of their religion.'<sup>89</sup> Around 1688 an Englishman travelling through India contrasted what he perceived as the official tolerance during 'Alamgir's reign with the intolerance then prevailing in his own country. 90

On the other hand, in 1679 'Alamgir issued an order reinstating the discriminatory *jizya* tax, effectively a property tax levied on all non-Muslim males except those in imperial service. The order for this tax, which had never been imposed by a previous Mughal ruler and was only occasionally collected by the Delhi sultans, was definitely carried out. Considering the timing of the decree, it has been suggested that the emperor felt the need to make some dramatic move to rally the empire's Muslims around major political and military initiatives then being contemplated for dealing with deteriorating affairs in the Deccan.<sup>91</sup> Ever since 1663 Shivaji had flagrantly defied Mughal authority, and by the late 1670s, with both Bijapur and Golconda often colluding with the new Maratha kingdom, the emperor's Deccan policy lay in shambles. The order for the *jizya* tax was followed directly by a full-scale invasion of the plateau. To the

juridically minded emperor, moreover, non-Muslims living under Mughal rule were, in a narrowly legal sense, a protected population (*dhimmi*) who were obliged to pay this tax to compensate for not serving in the state's armed forces. Curiously, though, to the contemporary Hindu writer Bhimsen, it was not the tax itself that was offensive; rather, it was the corruption of the venal officials who had been recruited from the lower ranks of the Muslim clergy to collect it.<sup>92</sup>

In any event, 'Alamgir himself would not have seen the imposition of the *jizya* tax as politically destabilizing, given the evidence that throughout his reign he scrupulously avoided letting religious considerations threaten the empire's political stability. On one occasion he referred to his chief *qazi* the question of whether captured Hindu rebels should be treated differently from captured Muslim rebels. The *qazi* decreed a light punishment for Muslim rebels, but release for Hindus if they converted to Islam. 'Alamgir, however, returned the decree, ordering that a different ruling should be found, so 'that control over the kingdom may not be lost'. Accordingly, the *qazi* and his learned advisers returned a new judgment, that all the prisoners should be executed regardless of their religion, a decision the emperor accepted.<sup>93</sup> On another occasion, a Sunni Muslim petitioned the emperor for a post as imperial paymaster on the grounds that the two existing paymasters were both Shi'i, and that appointing him would bring sectarian balance to the office. Irritated by the request, 'Alamgir replied:

What connection have earthly affairs with religion? And what right have administrative works to meddle with bigotry? '*For you is your religion and for me is mine*' [Qur'an 109:6]. If this rule [suggested by you] were established, it would be my duty to extirpate all the [Hindu] Rajahs and their followers. Wise men disapprove of the removal from the office of able officers.<sup>94</sup>

After all, Rajputs, Marathas, Brahmins, Jains, Kayasthas and other non-Muslims were essential for running the empire's vast

administrative and military systems. This much is seen in the significant increase in the number of Hindus serving in 'Alamgir's *mansabdari* corps. Under Shah Jahan, Hindus comprised less than a quarter (22.4 per cent) of all nobles holding a rank of 1000 *zat* or higher. By the last years of 'Alamgir's reign that figure had risen to nearly a third (31.6 per cent) of the total.<sup>95</sup>

In keeping with the Mughal and Delhi sultanate precedent of viewing non-Muslim monuments within their sovereign domain as deserving of state protection, 'Alamgir supported temples with cash or land grants. He once ordered officials in Benares to punish miscreants who had been harassing Brahmins in charge of that city's Hindu temples.<sup>96</sup> And he described the temple complex of Ellora, which he visited in the 1650s, as 'one of the marvels of the work of the true transcendent Artisan [God]'.<sup>97</sup> But his treatment of temples patronized by, or associated with, state enemies was another matter. Muslim sovereigns since the late twelfth century, and Hindu rajas since at least the seventh, had looted, redefined or destroyed royal temples of enemy kings as the normal means of detaching defeated rulers from the most prominent manifestations of their former sovereign authority, thereby rendering such rulers politically impotent.<sup>98</sup> For the Mughals, temples formerly patronized by enemy kings became state property once that king had been defeated and his former territory annexed to the empire. However, if a Hindu patron of such a temple rebelled against the state, both he and the temple were liable for punishment. Such a principle would explain 'Alamgir's destruction of temples in Kuch Bihar (north of Bengal) after local rajas there defied Mughal authority in 1661. The same principle accounted for his destruction of the Vishvanath Temple in Benares in 1669: people related to that temple's patron were believed to have facilitated Shivaji's escape from Agra, and hence were state enemies. Similarly, the Keśavaḍeva Temple in Mathura, which had been supported by imperial grants and was therefore considered state property, was destroyed in 1670 in the wake of a serious Jat rebellion in the region that claimed the life of the city's commandant and patron of its congregational mosque. Moreover,

three Brahmins in Mathura had harboured the son of Shivaji shortly after the latter had escaped detention in Agra. In 1679–80 'Alamgir ordered the destruction of prominent temples in Rajasthan – including Khandela, Udaipur and Jodhpur – once it was established that they, too, had been associated with anti-state rebels.<sup>99</sup>

How, then, did non-Muslims view 'Alamgir and his actions regarding religion? Among Rajputs, representations of the emperor could vary enormously, even at the same court. At the Sisodiya court at Udaipur, a text composed just before the rebellion of 1679–81 portrays 'Alamgir as benevolent towards Rana Raja Singh, the raja of Mewar. However, another text, composed during the rebellion while the Sisodiya elite had retreated to the hills and Mughal troops were occupying their capital, vilifies and demonizes the emperor, portraying him as representing a community perennially in conflict with Hindus. But then a third text, completed at the same court shortly after the suppression of the rebellion and the normalization of Mughal–Sisodiya relations, depicts 'Alamgir as a benevolent ally of the Sisodiya ruler, whom the emperor appreciated and rewarded.<sup>100</sup> Clearly, such varied representations depended on specific historical contexts. Similarly, in today's more religiously polarized climate it is widely believed that Krishna images were forcibly removed from the Braj heartland to Rajasthan in the 1660s and 1670s owing to 'Alamgir's alleged iconoclastic zeal. Contemporary evidence, however, suggests that the images were moved not because of the emperor's alleged iconoclasm but because of insecurity due to local Jat uprisings and threats by sectarian rivals to appropriate them for themselves – conflicts that the emperor himself is said to have mediated.<sup>101</sup>

Taking a much wider perspective, 'Alamgir's India – unlike South Asia in the colonial and post-colonial eras – appears to have been conceptually integrated even while culturally diverse. This much is seen in the memoir of Bhimsen, who portrays the India of his day, the late seventeenth century, as filled with the great cities of the 'heaven-protected' Mughal empire as well as with the seven famous rivers and the seven sacred centres of Hindu mythic geography. At

the symbolic centre of that seamlessly interwoven realm, and holding it together conceptually, stood 'Alamgir, sacred king and heir to the spiritual charisma of his Timurid ancestors.<sup>102</sup> Bhimsen describes an incident during the monsoon of 1697 when the Bhima flooded its banks at 'Alamgir's camp at Machnur, drowning many people and bringing its waters to within a metre of the emperor's tent. With the whole camp plunged in a state of distress, the emperor wrote a prayer on a slip of paper and cast it on the river's surface. The water immediately subsided and, records Bhimsen, 'the prayer of the Goddevoted Emperor was accepted by God, and *the world became composed again*'.<sup>103</sup> What actually happened on that day we will never know with certainty; but Bhimsen's memoir suggests how Indians of 'Alamgir's own time interpreted the meaning of the great flood of 1697.<sup>104</sup>

Similarly, in 1672 a peasant uprising, the Satnami revolt, broke out in Narnaul (in modern Haryana), in the course of which a prophetess appeared proclaiming that she could use spells to raise an invisible army. When the uprising took an alarming turn, the emperor dispatched a large force with banners on which he wrote prayers and magical figures with his own hand. Fighting magic with magic, 'Alamgir was seen by his contemporary subjects as having bridged the spiritual and mundane worlds. Indeed, he was popularly known as *'Alamgir zinda pir*, 'Alamgir, the living saint.<sup>105</sup> It was even believed that he was capable of making himself invisible whenever he wished, and could instantly appear in Mecca and converse with the Prophet Muhammad. 'From this cause,' noted Manucci, 'the people revere him, and hold him in the greatest respect.'<sup>106</sup> Indians of his day assessed the spiritual status of their leaders by their observed actions. On one occasion, the emperor spent a week in Gulbarga paying respects to the shrine of the Deccan's most renowned Sufi shaikh, Muhammad Gisudaraz, and conversing with reclusive Sufis there. For Bhimsen, the emperor's behaviour was salutary and redemptive, as would be expected of a sovereign perceived as connecting the divine and earthly worlds. By contrast, Shivaji's plundering of the town of Jalna, home of a spiritually gifted

holy man named Jan Muhammad, was in Bhimsen's view a reckless act unbefitting a proper sovereign, and the probable cause of the Maratha king's untimely death.<sup>107</sup>

Such contemporary observations highlight a fundamental tension between two opposing conceptions of Mughal sovereignty – the one that 'Alamgir had inherited, and the one that he would promote. By his Indo-Timurid forebears he was bequeathed the identity of a sacred king, a lustrous persona that his father had assiduously cultivated and that his subjects now invested in him. It was also a persona that 'Alamgir occasionally and strategically adopted, as seen in the several episodes cited above. But notwithstanding his popular reputation as a 'living saint', 'Alamgir came to formulate a very different model of sovereignty for himself and for the empire he ruled. In this new dispensation, the kingdom would be governed not by a charismatic, semi-divine king, but by impersonal law – namely, the *shari'a* of Hanafi Sunnis – administered by a reconstituted and vastly empowered judiciary guided by a reformed, thoroughly codified legal system. At the same time, the emperor took dramatic and very public steps to place himself beneath that law. In 1675 he proclaimed that anybody in the empire with a legal claim against him could appeal to specially appointed judicial officials who were sent to every city, province and neighbouring territory of the empire precisely to hear such claims.<sup>108</sup>

It was not only the emperor's puritanical character that led him to embrace such a sweeping agenda for himself and for the empire.<sup>109</sup> Nor was it just the political necessity of distancing himself from his bitter rival Dara Shukoh who, lacking military competence, had wrongly imagined that embracing the Timurid ideology of sacred kingship would elevate him to the Peacock Throne. 'Alamgir's goal of replacing his dynasty's tradition of sacred kingship with an impersonal judicial state actually preceded the War of Succession. Formative in his thinking were the years 1645 to 1647 when, while still a prince, he was sent to govern Gujarat, a province then seething with Shi'i or quasi-Shi'i millennial movements. One of these, the Mahdavi, was initiated by a fifteenth-century charismatic leader,

Muhammad Jaunpuri (d. 1505), who had professed to be the Mahdi, a figure who in Shi'i thought will return at the end of the millennium to restore the world to order. When Prince Aurangzeb reached Ahmedabad, he was met by a body of anti-Shi'i and anti-millennial Sunni clerics who, determined to mobilize the new governor's power to suppress a sect they regarded as heretical, arranged to have the Mahdavi leader interrogated in open court. When that leader provoked the Sunni clerics with militant language, Aurangzeb expelled him and his followers from the city. <sup>110</sup> Soon thereafter, Aurangzeb had to deal with a more openly Shi'i group, the Isma'ili Bohras. This was a prosperous merchant community in Gujarat whose leader, or *da'i*, provided spiritual direction for the community until the expected Shi'i messiah, or *imam*, would (re)appear at the end of time to cleanse the world. Again, urged on by vehemently anti-Shi'i clerics, Aurangzeb presided over a religious interrogation in which his Sunni clerics levelled serious charges against the Bohra *da'i*, such as the claim that the sect's veneration of the Prophet's son-in-law 'Ali amounted to idolatry. Under intense pressure by the clerics, the *da'i* ultimately confessed to all the charges and was executed.

As a consequence of his experience governing Gujarat and collaborating with its Sunni clerics in suppressing millennial movements, the prince came to appreciate the use of judicial power not just for dealing with such phenomena – throughout his reign, he persecuted Gujarat's Isma'ili Bohras – but for maintaining public order generally. This, in turn, had several consequences. First and most immediately, once he became emperor, 'Alamgir drew into his inner ruling circle some of the most powerful anti-Shi'i clerics with whom he had cooperated while governor of Gujarat and the Deccan. During his second governorship of the Deccan (1652–9), he had made Qazi 'Abd al-Wahhab, a member of an old family of *qazi*s in northern Gujarat, his legal expert (*mufti*); thereafter he became one of the emperor's closest and most powerful advisers. This was the same man who issued the judgment legitimizing the prince's seizure of the Peacock Throne, for which he was rewarded by being made

the empire's supreme judge (*qazi al-quzat*), a post he held until his death in 1675. For forty of 'Alamgir's forty-nine years as emperor, Gujarati clerics held the highest positions in the imperial judiciary. All were anti-millennial and anti-Shi'i.<sup>111</sup>

Throughout 'Alamgir's reign, socio-religious movements of the sort he had earlier confronted in Gujarat repeatedly broke out – some of them Shi'i-based, some not – to most of which he and his judiciary had the same response: investigate, interrogate, then either rectify with persuasion or suppress with fines or violence. Such encounters informed his efforts to place the entire edifice of the Mughal state on a footing that privileged impersonal law above the sacred king. Visually, 'Alamgir's support of the clerical establishment was symbolized by the most ambitious monument he ever patronized: Lahore's splendid Badshahi Mosque (1671–3), for more than three centuries the largest mosque in the world [see Fig. 18]. But a more telling move was his sponsoring the codification and promulgation of the Hanafi Sunni legal code in a single, massive and authoritative compendium: the *Fatawa-i 'Alamgiri*. This comprehensive manual of Islamic jurisprudence, which took a team of nearly fifty scholars eight years to complete (1667–75), streamlined procedures and standardized rulings in what had previously been a chaotic judicial environment. Before its publication, a welter of law books had produced confusion and conflicting rulings by local judges across the empire.<sup>112</sup> The new manual also sought to harmonize the law as applied by India's *qazi*s with the legal norms established by Hanafi jurists of the eighth century. Most importantly, its compilation and dissemination placed the empire under a comprehensive legal code intended to supplant the mystery and majesty of a sacred sovereign. Indeed, the importance 'Alamgir attached to this project compares with the priority his father had given to building the Taj Mahal, except that Shah Jahan's already world-famous tomb and 'Alamgir's *Fatawa-i 'Alamgiri* reflect sharply opposing visions of kingship. If the former portrays Shah Jahan as the resplendent sovereign of a sacred realm, the latter reveals 'Alamgir as the pious, would-be patron of a judicial state.

Given the widespread use of Islamic law by diverse communities in 'Alamgir's India, the emperor's aim of standardizing that legal tradition and using it as a basis of Mughal sovereignty made a certain sense.<sup>113</sup> In the courts of local judges in Gujarat, Hindu artisans, merchants and Brahmins commonly invoked the *shari'a* in transactions pertaining to buying, selling, renting and mortgaging property, or in pursuing litigation in law courts. Hindu women in particular used Islamic law in their attempts to resist patriarchal domination.<sup>114</sup> The same held true further north. In the Punjabi town of Batala, writes the historian J. S. Grewal, 'the *brahmin*, the *khatri*, the goldsmith and the Hindu carpenter frequented the *qazi*'s court as much as the *sayyid* and the Muslim mason'.<sup>115</sup> And in Malwa, the vast majority of attesters in court documents, excepting those dealing with Muslim marriages, were non-Muslims. While acknowledging religious difference, moreover, such courts did not draw legal boundaries around India's ethnic or religious communities. Significantly, the word *shari'a* as used in local courts was not understood as applying to Muslims only, as it is today. Rather, it carried the ordinary and non-sectarian meaning of 'legal'.<sup>116</sup> Until the 1770s, when East India Company officials codified separate legal systems for Muslims and Hindus, Islamic law as it was administered in Mughal courts had functioned as common law. 'Alamgir's project of basing Mughal governance and sovereignty on a standardized codification of that law therefore built upon legal practices that, even though applied differently across the empire, were already in place in the Indian countryside.

However, the Timurid ideology of a sacred sovereign, conspicuously invoked by the emperor's nearest predecessors Shah Jahan, Jahangir and Akbar, could not easily be abandoned. It was too deeply ingrained in the culture of the empire's subjects, despite their various ethnic or religious identities. For generations, such an ideology had conferred an aura of legitimacy on Mughal emperors. Consequently, by enshrining law and empowering the judiciary while playing down the Timurid notion of sacred kingship, the emperor was

sawing off the branch on which he sat, for his authority rested on being accepted as a sacred king.<sup>117</sup>

### CONCLUSION

For nearly a half century, the Mughal empire was ruled by one of the most complex and controversial figures in Indian history. 'Alamgir's character was defined by many qualities, some of them contradictory. From an early age he showed remarkable courage, which was repeatedly displayed on battlefields. A steely sense of duty and self-discipline translated into a lifelong commitment to administrative detail, if not minutiae; in modern times he might be called a workaholic. His court historian Muhammad Kazim records that he slept only three hours a night.<sup>118</sup> The Italian traveller Manucci corroborates this observation, adding that he sat up until midnight 'unceasingly occupied' with official business.<sup>119</sup> Yet his devotion to work also prevented him from delegating authority to others and led to meddling in the affairs of his officers and his sons. 'I came to know', he wrote disapprovingly to his second son Mu'azzam, 'that you disregard the soldiers and care more for the highly paid servants.' Or again, to the same son, 'I came to know from a letter of a dear friend that you attend the court with a saffronlike turban on your head.'<sup>120</sup>

In the end, one is left with perhaps the greatest enigma of 'Alamgir's long reign: why did he spend a quarter-century relentlessly pursuing two Deccan sultanates and the Marathas – a futile enterprise that even contemporaries such as Bhimsen knew was running the empire into the ground? One answer lies in his obsessively industrious character. It was due to his focus, dedication, discipline and tenacity that the emperor held court twice daily, micromanaging nearly everything, personally reviewing and signing off on the most routine documents. But the virtue of tenacity could also become the defect of stubbornness, as seen in his refusal to change policy paths or his inability to discern larger geopolitical patterns. 'Alamgir's indefatigable industriousness might have served him well had he been a clerk or middle-level functionary in the Mughals' vast

bureaucracy. <sup>121</sup> But good political leadership requires vision, imagination and flexibility, which were not 'Alamgir's strengths. For twenty-five ruinous years he remained trapped in a quagmire of his own making, constitutionally unable to imagine a way forwards beyond his Sisyphean task of doggedly pursuing the Marathas, fort by fort.

Another possible answer to the enigma of 'Alamgir is hinted at by the Italian traveller Giovanni Careri, who in 1695 was granted a private audience with the emperor at one of his Deccan camps. The foreigner afterwards reflected on the underlying reasons for the emperor's long and fruitless Deccan campaign:

fearing with much reason the perverse Inclination of his Sons, he had continu'd in Arms in the Field for 15 Years; and particularly four Years at *Galgala* [Galgali, on the Krishna], after defeating [Prince] *Akbar*. He said his Father *Sciah-Gehan* [Shah Jahan] had not so much discretion; for he might have learnt by many years' Experience, that the Kings of Indostan when they grow Old, must keep at the head of Powerful Armies, to defend themselves against their Sons.<sup>122</sup>

Haunted by the fear that his sons might do to him what he had done to his own father, 'Alamgir felt compelled constantly to remain in the field, ever at the helm of the army, warily watching them and his grandsons.

John Dryden could hardly have foreseen the morass of the emperor's protracted Deccan campaign, since he wrote his play *Aureng-zebe: A Tragedy* in 1675, five years before that campaign began. Yet he does give his protagonist the telling lines, 'I know my fortune in extremes does lie: The Sons of Indostan must Reign, or die'. The extremes Dryden had in mind were those needed to gain the throne. But gaining the throne, as it turned out, was the easier part of 'Alamgir's lifelong struggle. In order to retain the throne, especially after his sons and even grandsons had reached maturity, he had to resort to extremes of another sort – of remaining

constantly engaged in war, personally leading his army while vigilantly watching his own offspring, keeping them in check.
