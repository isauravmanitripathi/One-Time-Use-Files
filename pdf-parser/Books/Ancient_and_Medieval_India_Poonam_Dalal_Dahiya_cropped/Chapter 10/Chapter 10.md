# PERIOD FROM C. 1000 TO 1200 CE: NORTHERN INDIA

As we have discussed in the last chapter, the period from c. 1000 to 1200 CE in northern India is primarily known as the age of conflict. It resulted in the breakdown of the tripartite powers (the Rashtrakutas, the Palas, and the Pratiharas) into many smaller kingdoms all over the country. For example, in northern India, the disintegration of the Pratihara empire brought to the forefront various Rajput states under the control of different Rajput dynasties, such as the Chahamanas (Chauhans), Chandellas, the Paramaras of Malwa, and so on. These states fought and resisted the Turkish attacks from northwest India led by Mahmud of Ghazni and Mohammad Ghori in the 11th and 12th centuries, but their failure to stand united against the invaders eventually led to their defeat.

### THE RAJPUT CLANS

In the early 12th century, the term *Rajaputa* came into prominence, which referred to certain specific lineage-based clans. The basis of Rajput society was the clan, and every clan traced its descent from a common ancestor (real or imaginary). Some historians believe that they were the descendants of various groups of foreign invaders such as the Shakas, the Kushanas, the Hunas, and so on, who had gradually settled down in the region of Rajasthan and, after intermingling with Indian society, emerged as a warrior class. Other historians consider them as a part of the Kshatriya *varna* of the Brahmanical system. Scholars like B.D. Chattopadhyaya consider that the Rajput clans emerged due to multiple factors like the expansion of the agrarian economy. The distribution of land among royal kinsmen allowed many local chiefs to acquire enough financial and political power to set up an independent authority. Meanwhile, inter-clan collaboration in the form of political and matrimonial alliances as well as the construction of fortresses on an

unprecedented scale led to a consolidation of the clan structure. These clans dominated a compact territory. Attachment to land, family, and 'honour' were the characteristic features considered important by the Rajput clans.

In order to acquire legitimacy and authenticity for their newly acquired position in the eyes of their subjects, the Rajput clans invited *Brahmanas* from the Gangetic delta and other regions to perform royal rituals and ceremonies. In return, they were given land and other things as *dakshina* (fee). The *Brahmanas* were also asked to write about the Rajputs illustrious ancestry, linking them with Lord Rama (of the *Suryavansha*) and Lord Krishna (of the *Chandravansha*) in order to claim a dignified position among the warrior classes. their illustrious ancestory linking them with lord Rama (of the solar race) and lord Krishna (of the lunar race) to claim a dignified position of a warrior class. Certain clans also claimed *agnikula* origins for themselves, referring to a myth wherein these clans emerged out of the sacrificial fire of sage Vashishta on Mount Abu. The four *Agnikula* Rajput clans were:

- a. The Pratiharas (who we have discussed in the last chapter)
- b. The Chahamanas/Chauhans of Ajmer.
- c. The Chandellas of Bundelkhand.
- d. The Paramaras of Malwa.

Apart from them, according to medieval bardic traditions, there were about 36 Rajput clans which included Gahadavalas of Kannauj, the Tomaras of Delhi, the Solankis, the Chalukyas of Gujarat, and so on.

Rajput social organisation had its advantages as well as disadvantages. The sense of brotherhood and egalitarianism which prevailed among the Rajputs was both an advantage and a disadvantage as it also made it difficult to maintain discipline among the different clans. They treated war as a sport, which led to continuous warfare among them over struggle for land and cattle. Most of the Rajput rulers were staunch Hindus, though some of them patronised Jainism too.

**The Chahamanas/Chauhans**

The Chahamanas of Shakambhari, colloquially known as the Chauhans of Sambhar, ruled in parts of the present-day Rajasthan and its neighbouring areas between 7th and 11th centuries CE. They were the most prominent ruling family of the Chahamana clan. The Chahamanas originally had their capital at Shakambari, which is identical to modern Sambhar near Jaipur in the Sapadalaksa country (part of present-day Rajasthan). However, the later rulers moved the capital to Ajmer, and for this reason, they are also known as the Chahamanas (Chauhans) of Ajmer. They were originally feudatories of the Pratiharas and assumed independence during the reign of King Simharaja.

Simharaja (c. 944−971 CE)

– Founded the Chahamana/Chauhan dynasty around 10th century CE and adopted the title of *Maharajadhiraja*.

Vigraharaja II (c. 971−998 CE)

- Defeated Mulraja I and overran Gujarat.
- Captured Chittor.

Ajayaraja II (c. 1110−1135 CE)

- Next important ruler who carried on the aggressive policy, defeated the Paramaras and captured their capital Ujjaini.
- Founded the city of *Ajayameru* (Ajmer).

Vigraha raja IV (c. 1150−1164 CE)

- Also known as Visaldev, who captured Delhi from the Tomars in c.1151 CE but allowed them to rule as feudatories. He also took possession of Eastern Punjab, sacked and plundered Gujarat. The records of his reign states that his kingdom extended in the north up to the Siwalik Hills and in the south up to Udaipur.
- Moved the capital from Shakambhari (Sambhar) to Ajmer.
- Also came in conflict with the Paramars of Malwa, which was probably ruled by their famous ruler Bhoja.
- Patronised literature and authored a famous play, *Harikeli Nataka*.
- The structure that was later converted into the Adhai Din Ka Jhopra mosque was constructed during his reign.

#### Prithviraj III (c.1177−1192 CE)

– The most famous of all Chauhans, is popularly known as Prithviraj Chauhan or Rai Pithora in the folk legends. He scored victories over all his neighbours, including the Chandella king Paramardi, Chalukya Bhima II and Gahadvala Jayachandra.

![](_page_4_Picture_2.jpeg)

- Ascended the throne at the young age of 11, after death of his father Someshvara, but took the reigns of administration in his hands when he was 16.
- Led an expedition in Bundelkhand against the Chandella ruler and its capital Mahoba and it was in this struggle the famous Chandella warriors Alha and Udal lost their lives.

#### Defeated Muhammad Ghori in the First Battle of Tarain in

- c.1191 CE.
- In 1192 CE, Muhammad Ghori defeated Prithviraj Chauhan in the Second Battle of Tarain, and subsequently executed him. His defeat at Tarain is seen as a landmark event in the Islamic conquest of India, and has been described in several semi-legendary accounts, most notably the *Prithviraj Raso*.
- Two great poems, *Prithviraj Raso* and *Prithviraj Vijaya*, were written by his court poets Chandbardai and Jayanaka respectively.

![](_page_5_Picture_4.jpeg)

Hari-raja (c. 1193−1194 CE)

- Muhammad Ghori followed up his victory by the conquest of Ajmer and Delhi and placed the young son of Prithviraj, *Govinda*, as his vassal in Ajmer. Govinda was de-throned and banished by Prithviraja's brother Hari-raja for accepting Muslim suzerainty. Govinda then established the Chahamana branch of *Ranastambhapura* (Ranthambore). Hari-raja regained Ajmer and followed a policy of hostility against the conquerors of Delhi.
- Qutabuddin Aibak invaded Ajmer, overthrew Hari-raja and

#### took the principality.

The Chauhan dynasty then retired to Ranthambhor and ruled there in diminishing glory. But in c.1301 CE, Ala-ud-din Khilji captured Ranthambhor and uprooted the last stronghold of Chauhan power.

### **The Chandellas of Bundelkhand.**

The Chandellas of Bundelkhand trace their descent to a mythical ancestor named Chandratreya, born of the moon. The Chandellas initially ruled as feudatories of the Gurjara−Pratiharas of Kannauj, and were involved in conflicts with the Pratiharas, the Palas, and the Kalachuris of Chedi (who bordered the Chandellas on the south). The Chandellas are well-known for their art and architecture, most notably for the fully developed Nagara- style temples at their original capital Khajuraho. The Lakshmana Temple (c. 930–950 CE), the Vishvanatha Temple (c. 999-1002 CE), and the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple (c. 1030 CE) were constructed during the reigns of Chandella rulers Yashovarman, Dhanga, and Vidyadhara respectively. They also commissioned a number of water bodies, palaces and forts at other places, including their strongholds of Jayapura-Durga (modern Ajaigarh), Kalanjara (modern Kalinjar), and their later capital Mahotsava-Nagara (modern Mahoba). In the first quarter of the 9th century CE, the dynasty was founded by Nannuka, who was the ruler of a small kingdom and established his capital at Kharjjuravahaka (Khajuraho).

Nannuka (c.831−845 CE)

– Was the founder king of Chandellas.

Vakpati (c. 845−865 CE)

– According to the Chandella inscriptions, Nannuka's successor Vakpati defeated several enemies.

Jayashakti and Vijayashakti (c. 865−885 CE)

- Vakpati's sons Jayashakti (*Jeja*) and Vijayashakti (*Vija*) consolidated the Chandella power.
- According to a Mahoba inscription, the Chandella territory

#### was named "Jejakabhukti" after Jayashakti.

Rahila (c. 885−905 CE)

– In many eulogistic inscriptions, Vijayashakti's successor Rahila is credited with several military victories.

Shri Harsha (c. 905−925 CE)

– Around 914 CE, Rahila's son Harsha played an important role in restoring the rule of the Pratihara King Mahipala, possibly after a Rashtrakuta invasion by king Indra III.

Yashovarman (c. 925−950 CE)

- Around 10th century, Yashovarman became practically independent, although he continued to acknowledge Pratihara suzerainty.
- He conquered the important fortress of Kalanjara, and according to a c. 954 CE Khajuraho inscription, he had several other military successes, including against the Gaudas (identified with the Palas), the Khasas, the Chedis (the Kalachuris of Tripuri), the Kosalas (possibly the Somavamshis), the Mithila (possibly a small tributary ruler), the Malavas (identified with the Paramaras), the Kurus, the Kashmiris, and the Gurjaras.
- His reign marked the beginning of the famous Chandella style art and architecture. He commissioned the famous Lakshmana Temple at Khajuraho.

![](_page_8_Picture_0.jpeg)

**Lakshmana Temple at Khajuraho**

#### Dhanga-Deva (c. 950−999 CE)

- The first independent Chandella king who took the title of *Maharajadhiraja* and under whose reign the Chandellas had become a sovereign power as unlike the earlier Chandella inscriptions, the records of Dhanga do not mention any Pratihara overlord.
- A Khajuraho inscription claims that *the rulers of Kosala, Kratha* (*part of Vidarbha region*), *Kuntala*, *and Simhala listened humbly to the commands of Dhanga's officers*. It also claims that the wives of the kings of Andhra, Anga, Kanchi, and Radha resided in his prisons as a result of his success in wars. These may be eulogistic exaggerations but they certainly suggest that Dhanga did undertake extensive military campaigns.
- Like his predecessor, Dhanga also commissioned a magnificent Vishvanatha Temple at Khajuraho.

![](_page_9_Picture_0.jpeg)

**Vishvanatha Temple at Khajuraho**

Ganda-Deva (c. 999−1002 CE)

– Dhanga's successor Ganda appears to have retained the territory he inherited.

Vidyadhara (c.1003−1035 CE)

- According to some legends, Vidyadhara killed the Pratihara king of Kannauj (possibly Rajyapala) for fleeing his capital instead of fighting the Ghaznavid invader, Mahmud of Ghazni.
- Mahmud later invaded Vidyadhara's kingdom and the conflict ended with Vidyadhara paying tribute to Mahmud.
- By the end of Vidyadhara's reign, the Ghaznavid invasions had weakened the Chandella kingdom. Taking advantage of this, the Kalachuri king Gangeya-deva conquered eastern parts of the kingdom.
- Vidyadhara is noted for having commissioned the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple.

![](_page_10_Picture_0.jpeg)

**Kandariya Mahadeva Temple**

#### Vijayapala (c. 1035−1050 CE)

- Vijayapala defeated Gangeya-deva in a battle. However, the Chandella power started declining during the Vijayapala's reign. The Kachchhapaghatas of Gwalior probably gave up their allegiance to the Chandellas during this period.
- The later rulers' power gradually declined as they had to fight many battles with the neighbouring dynasties, especially the Paramaras of Malwa and the Kalachuris of Tripuri. From the 11th century onwards, the Chandellas faced raids by the northern Muslim dynasties, including the Ghaznavids and the Ghurids. The Chandella power effectively ended around the beginning of the 13th century, following Chahamanas and Ghurid invasions.

Paramardi-deva (c. 1165−1203 CE)

- Was the last powerful Chandella king.
- Around 1183 CE, the Chahamana ruler Prithviraj Chauhan invaded the Chandella kingdom and sacked Mahoba (as per the Madanpur stone inscriptions). It is believed that Paramardi, in a fit of cowardice, took shelter in the

Kalanjara fort. The Chandella force led by Alha, Udal, and other generals, was defeated in this battle.

– There are different versions of Paramardi's fate, as according to some legends Paramardi either committed suicide out of shame or retired to Gaya, while others account that Paramardi restored the Chandella power and ruled as a sovereign until around 1203 CE, when the Delhi Sultanate invaded the Chandella kingdom. Some other historians such as the 16th century historian Ferishta believe that Paramardi was assassinated by his own minister, who disagreed with the king's decision to surrender to the Delhi forces.

The Chandella power did not fully recover from their defeat against the Delhi Sultanate. The Chandella power continued to decline because of the rising Islamic influence, as well as the rise of other local dynasties, such as the Bundelas, the Baghelas, and the Khangars. One *minor branch* of the family continued ruling *Kalanjara*, whose ruler was eventually killed by *Sher Shah Suri's* army in 1545 CE. Another *minor branch* ruled at *Mahoba*, and according to certain texts, one of its princesses married into the Gond royal family of Mandla.

### **The Paramaras of Malwa**

The Paramaras of Malwa were originally based in the Mount Abu area of Rajasthan. According to tradition, *the sage Vishwamitra stole Vashishtha's kama dhenu* (*wish-granting* cow). *In order to retrieve his cow, Vashishtha performed a sacrifice on Mount Abu and out of this sacrificial fire emerged a hero who seized his cow and was named Paramara* (*slayer of enemies*). He was thereafter crowned the king. The earliest known Paramara king, Upendra, was believed to be of the lineage of this hero. There are several branches of this dynasty, though the main branch ruled at Malwa, with its capital at Dhara (modern Dhar, MP). The c. 949 CE Harsola copper-plates issued by the Paramara king, Siyaka II, establish that the early Paramara rulers were feudatories of the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta, and were probably established in the

10th century CE. The Paramara power rose and declined several times as a result of their struggles with the Chalukyas of Gujarat, the Chalukyas of Kalyani, the Kalachuris of Tripuri, and other neighbouring kingdoms. The later Paramaras moved their capital to Mandapa-Durga (now Mandu) after Dhara was sacked multiple times by their enemies. Malwa enjoyed a great level of political and cultural prestige under the Paramaras. The Paramaras were well-known for their patronage to poets and scholars and Bhoja was himself a renowned scholar. Most of the Paramara kings were Shaivites and built several Shiva temples, although they also patronised Jain scholars.

Upendra (around first quarter of the 9th century CE)

- It is believed that he was made ruler of Deccan by the Rashtrakuta king Govinda III, after the latter's successful military expedition in Malwa. He is considered to be the founder of Malwa's Parmara dynasty.
- The Paramaras were temporarily eclipsed when they lost Malwa to the Pratiharas and their power was revived in the mid-10th century by Vairasimha II and Siyaka II.

Siyaka II (c. 948−972 CE)

– Around 972 CE, Siyaka (also known as Harsha) threw off his allegiance to the Rashtrakutas. He not only defeated the Rashtrakuta king, Khottiga, at Kalighatta on the banks of the Narmada, but also sacked the Rashtrakuta capital Manyakheta, and established the Paramaras as a sovereign power.

Munja (c. 972−990 CE)

– Also known as Utpala or Vakpatiraja II, who extended the empire and achieved many military successes such as that against the Kalachuris where he sacked their capital Tripuri. He led many expeditions into Rajputana and defeated the Hunas, sacked the capital of the Guhilas of Medapati Aghata, captured territories of the Chahamanas of Naddula, annexed Mount Abu and southern parts of Jodhpur from the other branch of Chahamanas and placed his sons and nephew in charge of the conquered territories.

He also invaded the Chalukyan kingdom of Anahilapataka and Lata.

- He was finally defeated by the Western Chalukyan ruler, Tailapa II. As a result of this defeat, the Paramaras lost their southern territories (possibly the ones beyond the Narmada river) to the Chalukyas.
- Adopted the titles of Amoghavarsha/Prithvivallabha/Srivallabha. Apart from being an accomplished military leader, he was a poet and patron of the arts and literature. He constructed many tanks and temples during his reign.

Sindhuraja (c.990−1010 CE)

- Munja's brother, who defeated the Western Chalukya king Satyashraya, and recovered the territories lost to Tailapa II. He also achieved military successes against a Huna chief, the Somavanshis of south Kosala, the Shilaharas of Konkana, and the ruler of Lata (southern Gujarat).
- His court poet Padmagupta wrote his biography, *Nava-Sahasanka- Charita*

Bhoja (c.1010−1055 CE)

- Sindhuraja's son and Munja's nephew Bhoja, who is the most celebrated ruler of the Paramara dynasty, and under whom the dynasty reached its zenith. Under his reign, the Paramaras extended their kingdom from Chittor in the north to upper Konkan in the south, and from the Sabarmati River in the west to Vidisha in the east.
- Around 1018 CE, he defeated the Chalukyas of Lata in present-day Gujarat. Between 1018 CE and 1020 CE, he gained control of the northern Konkan, whose Shilahara rulers probably served as his feudatories for a brief period.
- Formed an alliance against the Kalyani Chalukya King Jayasimha II, with Rajendra Chola and Gangeya-deva Kalachuri.
- During the last years of Bhoja's reign, around 1042 CE, Jayasimha's son and successor, Someshvara I, invaded Malwa and sacked its capital Dhara. Though Bhoja re-

established his control over Malwa soon after the departure of the Chalukya army, the defeat pushed back the southern boundary of his kingdom from Godavari to Narmada.

- His attempts to expand his kingdom eastwards was foiled by the Chandella king Vidyadhara. However, Bhoja was able to extend his influence among the Chandella feudatories, the Kachchhapaghatas of Dubkund. He also launched a campaign against the Kachchhapaghatas of Gwalior, possibly with the ultimate goal of capturing Kannauj, but his attacks were repulsed by their ruler Kirtiraja.
- Bhoja also defeated the Chahamanas of Shakambhari, killing their ruler Viryarama. However, he was forced to retreat by the Chahamanas of Naddula.
- Adopted the title of *Parameshvara-Paramabhattaraka*, which is considered to be identical to the title of Paramara-Deva. According to some medieval Muslim historians, after sacking Somnath, Mahmud of Ghazni changed his route to avoid confrontation with a Hindu king named Param Dev, who has been identified as Bhoja.
- It is also believed that Bhoja may have also contributed troops to support the Hindu Shahi ruler Anandapala's fight against the Ghaznavids. Around 1043 CE, he may have also been a part of the Hindu alliance that expelled Mahmud's governors from Hansi, Thanesar, and other areas around.
- During the last year of Bhoja's reign, or shortly after his death, the Solanki king Bhima-deva and the Kalachuri king Karna attacked his kingdom. According to some historians, Bhoja died of a disease at the same time the allied army attacked his kingdom.
- He is considered a righteous scholar king who himself was a polymath. His writings cover a wide variety of topics such as grammar, poetry, architecture, yoga, and chemistry. He patronised the arts, literature, and the sciences. He established the *Bhoj Shala*, which was a centre for Sanskrit

studies, and a temple of Sarasvati in present day Dhar.

– He is said to have founded the city of Bhojpur, credited with building of not only Bhojeshwar temple but also three dams in that area. He is often compared to the fabled Vikramaditya.

Jayasimha I (c.1055−1070 CE)

– Bhoja's son and successor who faced the joint Kalachuri −Solanki invasion immediately after Bhoja's death. Bilhana's writings suggest that *he sought help from the Chalukyas of Kalyani*.

Lakshmadeva (c.1086−1094 CE)

– Nagpur Prashasti inscription of c.1105 CE credits him with extensive military conquests.

Mahalakadeva, the last known Paramara king, was defeated and killed by the forces of Ala-ud-din Khilji of Delhi in c.1305 CE, although epigraphic evidence (an inscription from Udaipur) suggests that the Paramara rule continued for a few years after his death, until c.1310 CE, at least in the north-eastern part of Malwa. A later inscription shows that the area had been captured by the Delhi Sultanate by c.1338 CE.

### **The Chalukyas of Gujarat/The Solanki Rajputs**

The Solanki Rajputs are also known as the Chalukya family of Gujarat, which was different from the earlier Chalukyan dynasty of Badami. It ruled parts of Gujarat and Kathiawar between c.950 and 1300 CE. Unlike the Chalukyas of Kalyani and Vengi, the Solankis never claimed a shared descent or any other association with the original Chalukya dynasty. Interestingly, they never used the term 'Chalukya' to describe themselves, but chose to use its variant, '*Chaulukya*'. They had many branches, though three branches were the most prominent. The oldest branch ruled from Central India's Mattamayura and its earliest rulers were Simhavarman, Sadhanva, and Avanivarman. The other branch was

founded by Barappa in Lata (South Gujarat); the most prominent city of their kingdom was Bhrigukachchha (Broach). Another branch was founded by Mularaja I, whose capital was at *Anahilapataka* (or *Anahilavada*, which is identical to modern Patan, Gujarat).

Mulraja I (c. 940 – 995 CE)

- Mulraja I led many military expeditions against Saurashtra, Kutch, Abhiras, and so on. His power suffered a setback with the invasions of the Chahamanas and the Chalukyas of Lata.
- After being defeated by the Paramaras of Malwa, he took refuge with the Rashtrakuta king, Dhavala. Later, he recovered his kingdom, but his successors remained embroiled in conflicts with the Kalachuris and Paramaras.
- He was a Shaiva devotee, but also patronised Jainism as he built the *Mulavasatika* (Mula's residence) temple for the Digambaras and the *Mulanatha-jinadeva* (the Jina who is Mula's lord) temple for the *Shvetambaras*.

Bhima I (c. 1022 – 1064 CE)

- Grandson of Mulraja, and the next important ruler after Mularaja.
- During his reign, Mahmud of Ghazni overran Gujarat and plundered Somnath in 1025 CE.
- He built the Sun temple of Modhera. His wife Udaymati built the Rani-ki vav (Queen's step well) in his memory, which is on the list of UNESCO's World Heritage Sites.

![](_page_17_Picture_0.jpeg)

#### **Rani Ki Vav**

– It is pertinent to note that out of the five famous Dilwara temples, one Vimal Vasahi temple dedicated to Jain lord *Rishabha* was built in c.1031 CE by Vimalsha, a minister of Bhima I.

![](_page_17_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Vimal Vasahi Temple, Mount Abu**

Karan (c. 1065 – 1091 CE)

– He defeated a Bhil chieftain and founded Karnavati, which is now known as Ahmedabad.

Jayasimha Siddharaja (c. 1092 – 1142 CE)

- He ruled for about half a century, and enlarged the kingdom to become an empire.
- Apart from Saurashtra and Kutch, Jayasimha also conquered Malwa. One of the favourite legends of the Gujarat bards is woven around the siege of Junagadh by Jayasimha. The fort was ultimately captured by him along with Ranakdevi, wife of the Raja Rakhengar, the ruler of Junagadh. Ranakdevi preferred to commit sati rather than remarry Jayasimha and he was persuaded to allow her to burn herself on a pyre at Wadhwan. Ranakdevi temple still stands in Wadhwan at the site of her death.

![](_page_18_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Ranakdevi Temple**

– Hemachandra, a Jain monk, rose to prominence and had good relationship with the king. The Rudra Mahakala Temple at Siddhapur was built during his reign.

#### Kumarapala (c. 1142−1171 CE)

– During Kumarapala's reign, Gujarat's prosperity was at its peak.

- He too shared good relationship with Hemachandra and graciously patronised Jainism during his rule in Gujarat.
- He rebuilt the Somnath temple.

#### Bhima II (c. 1177−1240 CE)

- He successfully repelled the incursions of Muhammad Ghori (at the battle of Kayadara), who had the ambition of repeating the act performed by Mahmud of Ghazni.
- In c.1195−97 CE, an army led by Aibak, Ghori's *deputy*, invaded again, but Bhima II defeated Aibak again and adorned himself as *Abhinav Siddharaj*.

After c.1243 CE, the Solankis lost control of Gujarat to their feudatories, the Hindu Vaghela dynasty of Dholka, who established a short-lived (76 years) but powerful principality. After c.1292 CE, the Vaghelas became tributaries of the Seuna (Yadava) dynasty of Devagiri in the Deccan Plateau. The dynasty ended when Khilji conquered Gujarat in c.1297 CE. Another Dilwara temple, the Luna Vashi temple dedicated to Lord Neminath, was built in c.1230 CE by two Porwad brothers — Vastupal and Tejpal, who were both ministers of Virdhaval, the Vaghela ruler of Gujarat.

### **The Tomaras**

The Tomaras ruled the Hariyana (Haryana) country with their capital at Dhillika (Delhi) and they are believed to be a feudatory of the Pratiharas. Medieval bardic literature names the dynasty as "Tuar", and classifies them as one of the 36 Rajput clans. They often had conflicts with the Chahamanas of Shakambhari, and later, their rule was followed by that of the Chahamanas. A 13th century Palam Baoli (step well) inscription records that *the land of Hariyanaka was first enjoyed by the Tomaras, then by the Chauhans, and thereafter by the Shakas (that is, the Delhi Sultans*).

The iron pillar at Mehrauli carries an 11th century inscription which refers to one of the most famous kings of the Tomara dynasty, Anangapala Tomara who is widely believed as the ruler who established

Delhi. His coins also feature the horseman-and-bull figure, and bear the title *"Shri Samanta-deva"*. These coins are very similar to those of the Shakambhari Chahamana kings Someshvara and Prithviraja III, indicating that Anangapala was a contemporary of these 12th century kings.

The Tomara Rajputs have a special connnection with Delhi, and it is reflected in medieval legends too. According to a legend mentioned in the *Prithviraja Raso*, *a Brahmana told the Rajput king Anangapala Tomar that the base of the iron pillar rested on the hood of the Vasuki, the king of serpents, and that his rule would last as long as the pillar stood upright. Out of curiosity, Anangapala dug out the pillar, only to find it smeared with the blood of Vasuki. Realising his mistake, the king ordered it to be re-instated, but it remained loose* (*dhili*)*. Because of this, the area came to be known as* "*Dhilli*" (*modern Delhi*).

The Tomaras were associated with the construction of the earliest surviving waterworks in the Delhi area. Anangapala II was the founder of the citadel of Lal Kot in the Mehrauli area and also built a tank known as the Anang Tal. Similarly, the famous Suraj Kund reservoir (near Faridabad, Haryana) is said to have been commissioned by a Tomara king named Surajpala.

**Surajkund Reservoir**

**The Gahadavalas of Kannauj**

The Gahadvalas or Gaharwars, who claimed to be Suryavanshi kshatriyas, ruled the kingdom of Kannauj for approximately a hundred years, beginning in the late 11th century. Interestingly, the Rathore clan of the Rajputs claimed descent from the Gahadvala dynasty. Chandradeva founded the Gahadavala dynasty of Kannauj around c. 1090 CE. They gradually squeezed the Palas out of Bihar and made Banaras a second capital.

Chandradeva (around c. 1090 CE)

– Founding ruler of this dynasty who successfully wrested Delhi from both the Pratiharas and the Rashtrakutas and annexed it to his state of Kannauj.

Govindchandra (c.1114−1154 CE)

- Grandson of Chandradeva, who not only defeated the Ghaznavids and secured the release of his father Madan Chandra, but he also raised Kannauj to unprecedented glory as under his reign the state of Gaharwar reached the pinnacle of its power.
- His kingdom comprised much of the present day Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
- Govindachandra was a patron of both Hindu temples and Buddhist monasteries and his wife Kumaradevi was a devout Buddhist.

Vijayachandra (c.1154−1170 CE)

- Son of Govindachandra, who is identified with the names of Vijayapala/ Malladeva and he successfully faced aggressions of the Ghaznavids.
- However, during his reign, Delhi was lost and the Tomaras rulers stopped recognising Vijayachandra as their sovereign and probably aligned with the Chauhans of Ajmer.

Jaichandra (c. 1170 − 1194 CE)

– Son of Vijayachandra, who was the last great king of the Gahadavala dynasty. Their power and extensive jurisdiction was noticed by even Muslim historians. During his reign, the Chauhans from Ajmer under Prathviraj Chauhan

annexed Delhi. According to some legends, *Prithviraja loved Samyukta, daughter of Jaichandra. After opposition from her father, as Prithviraj was heir to the rival Chauhan Rajput kingdom to the west, Samyukta eloped with Prithviraj*. This further aggravated the dissension between the kingdoms, and Jaichandra then sought help from Muslims of the north to invade the Chauhans of Ajmer −Delhi. This romantic tale is the subject of a lot of folklore.

– Suffered a defeat at the hands of the king Lakshmansena of Bengal. After the fall of Delhi, around c.1194 CE, the city of Kannauj was attacked by Muhammad of Ghori. It is believed that Jaichandra was defeated in the Battle of Chanawar and subsequently drowned in the Ganga. His kingdom was conquered and was sacked by Ghori's armies.

Some survivors, led by Jaichandra's son and grandson Siyaji (Shiv ji), fled west to the Marwar desert region of Rajasthan, where they established themselves as rulers in the early 13th century. They founded the Rathore clan, which ruled the princely state of Marwar or Jodhpur. The glory of Kannauj ended with the conquest of Iltutmish.

## KINGDOM OF KASHMIR AND NORTH-WEST

Much of the history of Kashmir and North-west India is deduced from the legendary and historical chronicle *Rajatarangini* (which means 'the river of kings'). It was probably written in 12th century CE in Sanskrit by a Kashmiri *Brahmana* called Kalhana, though not much is known about him apart from what is written in the book. It is possible that his father, Champaka, was the minister in the court of Harsha of Kashmir. This earliest historical source consists of 7826 verses, which are divided into eight books called *Tarangas* (waves).

In early 7th century, the Karkota dynasty rulers established their rule in Kashmir. The dynasty marked the rise of Kashmir as a power in Central

Asia and Northern India. The Karkota dynasty (c. 625−855 CE) was founded by Durlabhvardhana during the lifetime of the Pushyabhuti king, Harshavardhana. The Karkota emperors were primarily Hindu, who have been known for building spectacular Hindu temples in their capital, Parihaspur. They, however, also patronised Buddhism, and some stupas, chaityas, and viharas can be found in the ruins of their capital.

### **Karkota Dynasty**

Durlabh Vardhana (c.598−634 CE)

– Also known as Prajnaditya and during his rule, Hsuan Tsang visited Kashmir.

Lalitaditya/Muktapida(c.697−733 CE)

- Most illustrious king of the Karkota dynasty. He was able to extend the power of Kashmir beyond the normal mountain limits. Lalitaditya was able to vanquish the Turks, Tibetans, Bhutias, Kambojas, and others. However, some historians believe that Kalhana highly exaggerated the conquests of Lalitaditya.
- His main success was against king Yasovarman of Kannauj.
- Built the famous Martand (Sun) Temple in Anantnag district, Kashmir which is the oldest known Sun temple in India and was also one of the biggest temple complexes of that time.

**Martand Sun Temple**

Vajraditya (c.734−741 CE)

– During his reign, Arabs made frequent raids upon Kashmir. Jayapida (c.745−776 CE)

- One of the more powerful Karkota kings, who led many military expeditions. For instance, he led a three year-long expedition against the eastern countries and claimed victory over the five chieftains of Gauda and ruler of Kannauj.
- It is believed that during the last years of his reign, he imposed excessive taxes on the advice of *Kayasthas*, and treated his subjects cruelly. It is said that he died because of a curse by a *Brahmana*.

The Karkota dynasty was followed by the Utpala dynasty. Avanti Varman ascended the throne of Kashmir on c.855 CE, establishing the Utpala dynasty and ending the rule of the Karkota dynasty.

### **Utpala Dynasty**

From the 8th to 10th century CE, the Kashmir region was ruled over by the Hindu Utpala dynasty. The kingdom was established by Avanti Varman, ending the rule of the Karkota dynasty in 855 CE. The political

history of early medieval Kashmir is incomplete without special mention of the *tantrins* (a body of foot soldiers), *ekangas* (a body of royal body guards) and the *damaras* (landed chiefs), who played a crucial role in the politics of that time and at times acted as kingmakers. The history of this region is also unique in one aspect of its tradition, namely, the legacy of powerful queens. The Rajatarangini mentions three women rulers, namely Yashovati of the Gonanda dynasty, Sugandha of the Utpala dynasty, and Didda of the Yashaskara dynasty (who had the longest and most eventful stint; she is discussed below).

#### Avanti Varman (c. 855−883 CE)

- He was the founder of the Utpala dynasty and was known as a great administrator. He took actions to stabilise the state and to regain the power. He controlled the powers of the *damaras*, rural aristocrats causing internal problems.
- Was a benevolent and beloved king, as he ensured the prosperity of the entire region. He was credited with taking major innovative works in the field of irrigation. For instance, he took steps to prevent the flood waters of the Mahapadma (Wular) lake from damaging crops.
- During his reign, the cities of Avantipur and Suyapur were founded, and many Hindu temples dedicated to both Vishnu and Shiva and Buddhist monasteries were built, notable of which is the Avantiswara and Avantiswami temples.

Sankara Varman (c. 883−902 CE)

- Son of Avanti Varman, who led military campaigns into the Punjab and Gujarat.
- His military operations led to the drain of wealth from the treasury, and as a result, heavy taxes were imposed on the people. Although he tried to regain some of the treasury's wealth by fiscal extortion, in acts such as plundering temples, the losses could not be recovered.

### **Yashaskara Dynasty**

Queen Didda (c.958 – 1003 CE)

- Her career is described in the sixth *taranga* of the *Rajatarangini*. She was the wife of king Kshemagupta and the daughter of Simharaja of Lohara (*which lay around the Pir Panjal range, on a trade route between western Punjab and Kashmir*), granddaughter of Bhima Shahi, one of the Hindu Shahis of Kabul.
- Didda ruled first as a regent for her son and various grandsons, and thereafter as the sole ruler in her own right. In fact, Kalhana disapproved of her; according to him, *her personality reflected the defects of womankind*. He has described her *as deficient in moral character, merciless by nature, and has further explained in detail how she ruthlessly killed her son and three grandsons before ascending the throne*. According to Kalhana, *she also had an affair with a courier and herdsmen named Tuna, who became her trusted confidante*. Even prior to becoming regent, Didda had considerable influence in state affairs, and coins have been found which appear to show both her name and that of Kshemagupta.
- She founded towns of Diddapura and Kankanapura, and a temple called the Diddasvamin temple.

After ruling indirectly and directly, Didda placed Sangramaraja, the son of her brother on the throne, diverting the royal succession from the Yashaskaras to her natal family, and thus started the Lohara dynasty in Kashmir.

### **Hindu Shahi Dynasty**

After the decline of the Kushana Empire in the 3rd century to the early 9th century CE, the Turkish Shahiya dynasty ruled over the Kabul valley (in eastern Afghanistan) and Gandhara (northern Pakistan and Kashmir). They were split into two eras: the Buddhist Shahis, and the

later Hindu Shahis, with the transition into Hinduism occurring around 870 CE. In the second half of the 9th century CE, Kallar, a *Brahmana* minister of King Lagaturman, overthrew the Shahiya king and laid the foundation of Hindu Shahi dynasty. The Shahis were rulers of predominantly Buddhist and Hindu populations and were thus patrons of numerous faiths, and various artifacts and coins from their rule have been found that display their multicultural domain.

Kallar (c. 890–895 CE)

- In the Rajatarangini, Kallar is referred to as *Lalliyashahi*, and was the Brahmana minister of the Shahi Dynasty.
- He was not able to maintain control over the Kabul valley for long, and around c. 870 CE, he was forced to move his capital from Kabul to Udabhanda (modern day Und village in Rawalpindi district, Pakistan) after being defeated by the Arab, Sarrarid Yaqui ibn.

Jayapala (c.964–1001 CE)

– He is celebrated as a hero for his struggles in defending his kingdom from the Turkish rulers of Ghazni. According to legends, King Jayapala was challenged by the armies of Sultan Sabuktigin in the Battle of Peshawar (c.1000 CE), and later by his son, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni.

Anandapala (c.1001 −1010 CE)

- The son of Jayapala, who was an able warrior and general. He led many battles prior to his ascension.
- However, during his reign as emperor, many losses were inflicted on his kingdom by the Ghaznavids. For instance, during the battle of Chach between Mahmud and Anandapala, some 30,000 *Gakhars* fought alongside as soldiers for the Shahi Emperor and incurred huge losses for the Ghaznavids. They still lost the battle and suffered much financial and territorial loss.
- He eventually signed a treaty with the Ghaznavid Empire in c.1010 CE, and shortly a year later died a peaceful death.
- Out of respect for his resistance against Mahmud of

Ghazni, some historians often compare him with King Porus, who bravely opposed Alexander.

Trilochanpala (c.1010−1022 CE)

- He tried to expand his kingdom by conquering the Shivalik Hills, the domain of the Rai of Sharwa. His kingdom extended from the River Indus to the upper Ganges valley.
- According to Al-Biruni, *Trilochanpala was honourable in his loyalty to his father's peace treaty to the Ghaznavids*. However, he eventually rebelled against Sultan Mahmud and was later assassinated by some of his own mutinous troops in 1022 CE, an assassination which was believed to have been instigated by the Rai of Sharwa, who became his arch-enemy due to his kingdom's expansion into the Shiwalik ranges.
- He was romanticised in Punjabi folklore as the last Punjabi ruler of Punjab.

Bheempala (c.1022–1026 CE)

- He is referred by famous historian Utbi as the '*fearless*' due to his courage and valour. He is known to have personally commanded the Battle of Nandana, where he is said to have seriously wounded the commander of the Ghaznavid army, Muhammad bin Ibrahim.
- He was final Shahi Emperor of the famed dynasty.
- The kingdom was destroyed by Mahmud of Ghazni in the beginning of the 12th century CE. Their remaining army was eventually exiled into northern India.

## THE CHEDIS OF TRIPURI

The state of Chedi was situated between the Narmada and Godavari rivers, and was ruled by the Kalachuri dynasty. Like the Chandellas, the Kalachuris of Chedi (also known as the Kalachuris of Tripuri) were formerly subordinate to the Pratiharas, but around the middle of the 10th century CE, they asserted their independence. They ruled the

historical Chedi region (also known as *Dahala-mandala*) with their capital at Tripuri, near modern Jabalpur, MP. The Kalachuris of Tripuri fought several battles against the Chandellas of Jejakabhukti, and later had matrimonial alliances with them. They also had to defend their territory against the Palas, and a confederacy of the Cholas, Pallavas, and the Pandyas.

Kokkala I (c.845−885 CE)

- He was the founder of the dynasty and undertook many military campaigns. He invaded Northern Konkan and helped the Rashtrakuta king, Krishna II, against the Eastern Chalukyas and the Pratiharas.
- He married a Chandella princess and it is believed that after his death, his eldest son succeeded him on the throne while the others were appointed rulers of different mandalas/provinces. This led to the disintegration of the kingdom, as descendants of one of these founded a separate kingdom in South Kosala with its capital at Tummana.

Yuvaraja (c. 915–945 CE)

- Another important ruler who defeated and drove out the Rashtrakuta forces. In order to celebrate this great victory, the famous poet Rajasekara staged his drama *Viddhasalabhanjika*.
- The Kalachuri inscription credits *Yuvaraja with successful raids against Kashmir and the Himalayan region*.

Lakshmanaraja (around the third quarter of the 10th century CE)

– He was also a great conqueror as he not only invaded and defeated Vangala (south Bengal), and the Somavamsi king of South Kosala, but he also invaded Lata in the west, then ruled over by a feudatory of the Rashtrakutas, and defeated the king of Gurjara, probably Mularaja I, the founder of the Chalukya Dynasty.

Gangeya-deva (c.1019–40 CE)

– One of the most important rulers of the Kalachuri dynasty, who, due to his military genius, made the Chedis one of the greatest political powers in India at the time. As a token of

his great victory, he assumed the proud title of *Trikalingadhipati* (the Lord of *Trikalinga*).

- He also assumed the title of *Vikramaditya*. Some historians believe that an important factor in his success was the fact that his *kingdom escaped the devastating raids* of Sultan *Mahmud*, which affected most of the other great powers to its north and north-west.
- He issued coins of different sizes, weights, and metals such as in gold, base gold, silver gold, Silver, silvery copper (billon), and copper. The four-armed Lakshmi, seated cross-legged on the lotus, holding a lotus in the upper two hands, with inscriptions in Nagari script *"Shrimad- Ga*/ *ngeyade*/*va"* on the reverse side, was introduced during his reign.

Lakshmi-Karna (c.1041–73 CE)

- Also known as the Karna, and like his father was one of the greatest generals of his time. He was more successful than his father not only in the south but also in the north-west and carried his victorious arms along the eastern coast to as far as Kanchi.
- He is said to have defeated many dynasties in the south such as the Pallavas, Kungas, Muralas, Pandyas (South) and Someshvara I.

Yashkarna (c.1073–1125 CE)

– His reign was marked by a series of invasions as the Chalukyas of Deccan raided his kingdom, and the Paramaras plundered his capital and encamped for some time on the Narmada. He was also defeated by the Chandellas. All these defeats gradually weakened the Kalachuris.

Vijayasimha (c.1177−1211 CE)

– The last king of the dynasty when Chandella ruler Trailokyavarman conquered nearly the whole of the Kalachuri kingdom, included Baghelkhand and Dahala Mandala.

Towards the beginning of the 12th century CE, the Chedi possessions were also lost to rising dynasties such as the Ganpatis of Warangal, the Yadavas of Devagiri, and the Vaghela Rajputs.

## THE SENAS OF BENGAL

The Sena Dynasty was a Hindu dynasty that ruled Bengal for little over a century (c. 1097−1225 CE). The empire at its peak covered much of the north-eastern region of the Indian subcontinent. Earlier, both Bihar and Bengal were under the domination of the Pala dynasty. They called themselves *Brahma Kshatriya*, and unlike the Palas who were Buddhist, the Sena rulers were staunch Hindus. The rulers of the Sena Dynasty traced their origin to the south Indian region of Karnataka, as indicated by the Deopara inscription. The Deopara inscription speaks of one of the founders in the South, Samanta Sen, whose successor was Hemanta Sen, the first *of the family to whom royal epithets are given in the family records and who usurped power from the Palas and styled himself king in c. 1095 CE*. His successor, Vijay Sena, helped lay the foundations of the dynasty.

Vijaya Sena(c.1095−1158 CE)

- Founder of the dynasty who had an unusually long reign of over 60 years, which restored peace and prosperity to Bengal and made a deep impression among its people. He is believed to have taken advantage of the revolt of Samantachakra in the Varendra region during the reign of Mahipala II, and gradually consolidated his position in western Bengal. He ultimately assumed an independent position during the reign of Madanapala.
- He conquered Vanga, defeating Bhojavarman
- Vijaya Sena had two capitals:
  - Vikrampura
  - Vijaypura
- The famous poet, Sriharsha, composed the *Vijay Prasasti* (Eulogy of Vijay) in memory of Vijay Sena. The Deopara

Prashasti is a stone inscription eulogising the Sena kings, particularly Vijaya Sen, composed by the court poet Umapati Dhara. Another inscription, the Barrackpore copper-plate, describes him as *Maharajadhiraja*.

Ballal Sena (c.1158−1179 CE)

- The best-known Sena ruler who consolidated the kingdom. He conquered Mithila/ portions of eastern Bihar. According to a tradition in Bengal, *Ballal Sena's kingdom consisted of the five provinces of Banga, Barendra, Rar, Bagri (possibly a portion of lower Bengal), and Mithila*. He made Nabadwip the capital as well.
- Ballal Sena is associated with the revival of orthodox Hindu practices in Bengal, in particular with the establishment of the reactionary tradition of Kulinism, although there is no historical authenticity to these accounts.
- He married Ramadevi, the princess of the Western Chalukya Empire, which indicates that the Sena rulers maintained close social contact with south India.
- Wrote the *Danasagara* and *Adbhutsagara*.

Lakshamana Sena (c.1178−1207 CE)

- The military glory of the Sena dynasty reached its climax under Lakshmana Sena, who expanded the Sena Empire to Assam, Odisha, Bihar, and probably to Varanasi as well. He also defeated Jayachandra of the Gahadavalas dynasty.
- Seven copper-plate inscriptions pertaining to his reign describe him *as a great military leader, and a patron of learning. His victories over the kings of Gaur, Kamrupa, Kalinga, and Kashi* have been mentioned in these inscriptions. He is also said to have erected pillars commemorating his military activities at Puri, Benares, and Allahabad. He was the first Bengali ruler to extend his suzerainty beyond Benaras. Some inscriptions found in Gaya shortly after his reign attest to his rule in the Gaya region.

- On his accession, he assumed the title of *Ariraja-Madana-Sankara*. Along with the traditional title of *Gaureswara*, he also assumed the title *Paramvaishnava* in place of the earlier epithet of *Paramaeshwara* used by both Vijay Sena and Ballal Sena. This indicates that Lakshmana Sena was a devout Vaishnav, unlike his father and grandfather, who were proclaimed Shaivas. This is also supported by the fact that all the official proclamations from then on started with an invocation to Narayana.
- Lakshmana Sena's court was adorned by Jayadeva (the famous Vaishanava poet of Bengal and the author of *Geet Govinda*), Dhoyi, and Umapati Dhar, among other distinguished poets. His prime minister, Halayudha, was himself a great poet. The king himself was a man of letters and according to tradition, completed the work *Adbhutsagara* begun by his father.
- During the later years of his reign, the disintegration of the Sena kingdom began. South Bengal, Orissa, and Kamrupa threw away Sena suzerainty. There were also invasions by Central Asian invaders of Turkish origin and of Islamic faith.

Towards the beginning of the 13th century (around c.1203–1204 CE), one of the generals of Muhammad Ghori, Muhammad Bin Baktiyar Khalji attacked Nabadwip and invaded Bengal and Bihar and annexed them to the Islmaic empire. He captured north-west Bengal, although eastern Bengal remained under Sena control. However, by the middle of 13th century, the Senas were overthrown by the Deva dynasty.

## THE GANGAS/CHODAGANGAS OF ORISSA

The Eastern Ganga dynasty, popularly known as the Chodagangas, were a Hindu dynasty. They reigned from the 11th century to the early 15th

century at Kalinga, and their kingdom consisted of the whole of the modern-day state of Odisha as well as parts of West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh. Their capital was known by the name Kalinganagara, which is the modern Srimukhalingam in Srikakulam District of Andhra Pradesh bordering Odisha. They are remembered as the builders of the Sun Temple at Konark, which is an UNESCO World Heritage site. It is pertinent to note that the Kesaris, who used to rule Orissa before the Gangas, built the Lingaraja temple at Bhubaneshwar.

The dynasty was founded by King Anantavarman Chodaganga, who claimed lineage from the Western Ganga Dynasty (that ruled southern parts of modern Karnataka state from the 4th century to the end of the 10th century) and the Chola dynasty. The Eastern Ganga rulers, who hailed from southern India and who were matrimonially related to the Chola empire and Eastern Chalukyas, naturally carried south Indian culture to Odisha, which is very well reflected in their currency. This kingdom prospered through trade and commerce and the wealth was mostly used in the construction of temples.

#### Anantavarman Chodaganga (c.1076–1150 CE)

- He assumed the title of *Trikalingadhipathi* in 1076 CE, that is, the ruler of the three Kalingas, which comprises of Kalinga proper (South), Utkal (North), and Kosal (West), and probably was the first king to rule all three divisions of Kalinga.
- He was a religious person as well as a patron of art and literature.
- Credited for having built the famous Jagannath Temple of Puri in Odisha.

![](_page_35_Picture_0.jpeg)

**Temple of Puri as Konask**

#### Narsimhadeva (c.1238–1264 CE)

– Another important king of this dynasty who constructed the Sun temple of Konark which is an UNESCO World Heritage site.

![](_page_35_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Sun Temple at Konark**

In the early 15th century, the rule of the dynasty came to end under the reign of King Bhanudeva IV (c.1414–34 CE). After the decline of the early Eastern Gangas reign, the Chalukyas of Vengi took control of the region.

### WESTERN CHALUKYAS OF

## KALYANI/LATER WESTRN CHALUKYAS

The Chalukyas who ruled from Kalyani (modern Basavakalyan in Karnataka) between the 10th and the 12th centuries CE are referred to as the Later Western Chalukyas (*please refer to the earlier chapters for a discussion of the Chalukyas of Badami*). Their kingdom covered most of western Deccan and southern India. Prior to the rise of the Chalukyas of Kalyani, the Rashtrakuta empire of Manyakheta controlled most of Deccan and central India for over two centuries. In 973 CE, taking advantage of the confusion caused in the Rashtrakuta ranks by invasion of Manyakheta by the Paramaras of Malwa, Taila or Tailapa II, a feudatory of the Rashtrakutas ruling from Bijapur region, defeated his overlords and made Manyakheta his capital. The dynasty quickly rose to power and grew into an empire under Someshvara I, who moved the capital to Kalyani.

Tailapa-II (c.957−997 CE)

– The founder of the later Western Chalukyas, who consolidated his realm with the help of earlier Chalukya family and with the help of the Kadambas and recovered much of the lost territories of earlier Chalukyas. The Kadambas were rewarded with the control over Banavasi and Goa.

Satyasraya (c.997−1008CE)

- Taila was succeeded by his son Satyasraya, who achieved a victory against the Chola king, Rajaraja, who had invaded Satyasraya's region. Rajaraja's territories were thus conquered by him.
- The successors of Satyasraya were Dasavarman, Vikramaditya V, and Jayasimha I (c. 1015−1042 CE). Jayasimha repelled invasions from the north as well as southern invasions from the Chola king, Rajendra.

#### Someshvara-I (c.1043−1068 CE)

- The son of Jayasimha, who expelled Rajadhiraja Chola, but the capital had already been plundered by the Cholas prior to it. Inscriptions state that *he broke the line of succession of Rajendra Chola by killing him*.
- According to tradition, Someshvara I preferred his second son Vikramaditya as his successor, but the latter declined the honour in favour of the elder Somesvara II (c. 1068−1076 CE). Vikramaditya conquered the Cholas, Kerala, and Ceylon as a general of his brother's army. However, Somesvara II soon fell into bad ways and thus lost the loyalty of his brother. Following this, Vikramaditya started ruling the southern part of the kingdom independently.

Vikramaditya VI (c.1076−1126 CE)

- The greatest ruler of this dynasty, who earned the title *Permadideva* and *Tribhuvanamalla* (meaning "*lord of three worlds*".)
- Vikramaditya also received submission from the ruler of Konkan, and soon marched against Vira Rajendra Chola. The latter pled for peace by giving offering his daughter's hand to Vikramaditya. When Vira Rajendra died, Vikramaditya placed his brother-in-law, Adhi-Rajendra, on the throne of Cholas.
- After his brother-in-law was killed, Vikramaditya was defeated by the Eastern Chalukya king Jayasimha, and was given the governorship of Bellary. However, in c.1076 CE, Vikramaditya reclaimed his power with the aid of the Hoysalas and ascended the throne as Vikramaditya VI. He introduced Chalukya−Vikrama era in c.1076 CE.
- During the rule of Vikramaditya VI, the Western Chalukyas convincingly contended with the Cholas. They ruled over territories that spread over most of the Deccan, between the Narmada River in the north and the Kaveri River in the south. He had several queens who ably assisted him in

administration.

- The two great writers, named Bilhana and Vijnaneswara, flourished in the court of Vikramaditya VI. He was the hero of Bilhana's *Vikramankadeva Charitra*. Bilhana came to his court from Kashmir and compared his rule to Ramarajya.
- Vijnaneshwara, the noted jurist in his court, wrote *Mitakshara*, a commentary on *Yagnavalkya Smriti* (on Hindu family law). Of the king he wrote, "*A King like Vikramarka is neither to be seen nor heard of*."
- Vikramaditya VI was a Shaiva by faith and his rule saw prolific temple-building activity. Notable constructions include the Mallikarjuna temple, the Mahadeva temple, the Kaitabheshvara temple, and the Kalleshvara temple.

The next successor, Somesvara III, was more interested in literary matters and allowed Vishnuvardhana Hoysala to grasp the opportunity to declare independence. The later rulers were not very capable either, and gradually the feudatories of the Chalukyas started declaring independence. However, the Chalukyas were able to recover their territory under the leadership of Somesvara IV, the son of Taila III. His suzerainty was acknowledged by the last Kalachuri ruler, Singhana. He soon gained the allegiance of the Kadambas of both Goa and Banavasi, and the Pandyas of Uchchangi. But with the attack from the Hoysalas under Vira Ballala I and the Yadavas of Devagiri, the later Western Chalukya dynasty came to an end in about c.1190 CE.

## DEVELOPEMENTS IN ART AND ARCHITECTURE, AND SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

The growth in scientific pursuits unfortunately slowed down during this period. The growth of science and technology is linked with the growth

of any society. However, as the society during this period became largely rigid and narrow in its outlook, scientific attitudes could not develop as well. As noted by the Central Asian scientist and scholar, Al Biruni, the *insular attitudes of the educated, in particular the Brahmanas, led a tremendous lack in inter-cultural scientific learning and collaboration*. Surgery declined, as the dissection of dead bodies was regarded as fit only for people of low castes such as barbers. Astronomy was now enveloped by astrology.

However, some advances were made in the field of mathematics as the 9th century *Ganitasarasangraha* of Mahaviracharya and the *Lilavati* of Bhaskar II was written during this period (c.1150 CE ), which remained a standard text for a long time. Bhaskara II (c.1114– 1185 CE), the greatest mathematician of medieval India and astronomer, was born in Bijapur in modern Karnataka. His main work, the *Siddhanta Shiromani*, (Sanskrit for "*Crown of Treatises*") is divided into four parts:

![](_page_39_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Bhaskara II**

- a. *Lilavati*: Deals with arithmetic and covers calculations, progressions, measurement, permutations, and other topics.
- b. *Bijaganita*: Deals with algebra, and under this section, Bhaskara discusses concepts such as zero, infinity, positive and negative numbers, and indeterminate equations including (the now called) Pell's equation.

- c. *Grahagaita*: Deals with the mathematics of the planets, and while treating the motion of planets, he considers their instantaneous speeds and also arrives at an approximation. Bhaskara accurately defined many astronomical quantities, including, for example, the length of the sidereal year, the time that is required for the Earth to orbit the Sun, as 365.2588 days.
- d. *Goladhyaya*: Deals with mathematics of the spheres.

He also wrote another treatise named the *Karana Kautuhala*. Bhaskara's work on calculus predates Newton and Leibniz by over half a millennium. He was perhaps the first to conceive the differential coefficient and differential calculus and its application to astronomical problems and computations.

In the field of medicine, certain minerals like mercury were discovered. Many books were written on plant sciences and for the treatment of animals, but not much research was done on the inter-breeding of horses and this further resulted in the perennial dependence of Indians on imports of horses from Central Asia.

The system of education, which had gradually developed in the earlier period continued without much change. The concept of mass education did not exist. Reading and writing was confined to a small section of the *Brahmanas* and the upper castes. The main subjects taught were the branches of Vedas and grammar. Education of a more formal kind with greater emphasis on secular subjects continued to be provided at some Buddhist viharas such as Nalanda, Vikramashila, and Uddandapura monasteries of Bihar. Kashmir was another prominent centre of education and many Shaiva sects and centres of learning flourished during this period. A number of important *maths* (education centres) were set up at Madurai and Sringeri in south India. The various centres of education provided an impetus to discussions on religion and philosophy.

RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS AND BELIEFS AND

## DEVELOPMENT IN PHILOSOPHY

This period is marked by the revival and expansion of Hinduism and a continued decline of Buddhism and Jainism. Apart from the intellectual challenge posed to Buddhism and Jainism by the revived Hiduism, at certain occasions there were instances of violence and forcible occupations of their sacred places as well. Buddhism was merely confined to eastern India, specially patronised by the Palas. However, Buddhism during this era assumed forms which made it indistinguishable from Hinduism. Jainism continued to be popular, specially among the trading communities. The Chalukyan rulers of Gujarat patronised Jainism and it was during this time that the famous and magnificent Dilwara temples of Mount Abu were built.

The revival and expansion of Hinduism took many forms. Shiva and Vishnu became chief gods and magnificent temples were built to proclaim their supremacy. This also ushered an era of cultural synthesis. A typical and important characteristic of this period was the growth of the Bhakti movement in South India which was led by popular saints called *Nayannars* (worshippers of Shiva) and *Alvars* (worshippers of Vishnu). In Alvar Bhakti, the relationship between the devotee and Krishna was often expressed in terms of the lover−beloved or mother −child relationship, whereas in Nayannar Bhakti, the relationship between the god and the devotee was similar to that between master and slave. Thus, the Nayannars describe themselves as *atiyar* (servant). From the 7th century onwards, the cult of Bhakti began to dominate the religious life of the South Indians and these saints played a major role in propagating it. The word *Bhakti* comes from the root *bhaj*, which means to share or participate. Thus, the word *'bhakta'* implies one who shares or participates in the divine. These saints rejected austerities and spoke and wrote in local languages such as Tamil and Telugu, which not only made them popular but also allowed common people to join the Bhakti movement. They looked upon religion not as matter of cold, formal

worship but based on a living bond between the god and the worshipper. These saints went from place to place carrying their message of love and devotion. They belonged to both upper castes and lower castes and also included women saints. Even though they disregarded the inequalities of caste, they did not oppose the caste system as such. The Bhakti movement, apart from bringing over many Buddhists and Jainas to the Hindu fold, won over many tribals as well.

Another popular movement which arose during the 12th century was the *Lingayat* or Vir Shaiva movement. Its founder was Basava and his nephew Channabasava, who lived at the court of the Kalachuri kings of Karnataka. The Lingayats were worshippers of Shiva and established their faith after bitter disputes with the Jainas. They strongly opposed the caste system and child marriage, and rejected feasts, fasts, pilgrimage and sacrifices. They supported widow remarriage.

It is also pertinent to mention the *Siddhas* (or *Sittars*) of Tamil Nadu, who held contrasting views with the Bhakti tradition, although some of their ideologies are considered to have originated during the first Sangam Age. Their attitude against idol worship and their stress on yoga and right conduct distinguished them from the Bhakti cults. They believed in the oneness of the transcendental being (monotheism) in the world as well as in charity towards men. The Siddha saints were mostly Shaiva, who professed and practised an unorthodox type of *sadhana* (spiritual practices) to attain liberation. A *siddha* obtains yogic powers called *siddhi* by constant practice of certain yogic disciplines and *tapasya*. Along with that, they also used *rasayanas*, which were substances that were said to transform the body to make it potentially deathless, and a particular type of *pranayama* (breathing practice). The Siddhas are also believed to be the founders of *Varmam*, a kind of martial art for self-defence and medical treatment simultaneously. *Varmam* are specific points located in the human body, which, when pressed in different ways can give various results, such as disabling an attacker in self-defence, or balancing a physical condition as an easy first-aid medical treatment. The Tamil Siddhas were the first to develop *"naadi paarththal"* (pulse reading) to identify the origin of diseases. It is believed that this method was later adopted and used in Ayurveda.

In the period that the Bhakti movement was gaining popularity in south India, Tantra was gaining traction in northern India. They too denounced the caste system and the privileges claimed by the *Brahmanas*. Tantra, like Bhakti, was open to all. The most famous Hindu Yogi who adopted these practices was Goraknath and his followers came to be called *Nath Panthis*.

Many schools of philosophy came into existence in this period. *Moksha* (salvation) became the main subject of the *darshana* schools. Hindu philosophy is generally classified into six orthodox or classical schools (*astika*) and three heterodox (*nastika*) schools. The basic difference between these two branches of philosophy schools is based on the recognition of the Vedas: the orthodox schools recognise the authority of the Vedas, while the heterodox schools do not believe in the authority of Vedas. Out of these nine systems, eight are atheistic as there is no place for God in them and only the Uttara Mimansa, which is also called Vedanta, has a place for God in it.

By the beginning of Christian era, six prominent schools of philosophy (*shatdarshan*) developed which are *Samkhya*, *Yoga*, *Nyaya*, *Vaisheshik*, *Purva Mimansa* and Uttar Mimansa (*Vedanta*):

- a. *Samkhya*: Literally means 'count'. Oldest school of philosophy, founded by Kapila.
  - Samkhya is strongly dualist as its philosophy regards the universe as consisting of two realities, *Purusha* (consciousness) and *Prakriti* (matter), which is further composed of three basic gunas (elements), namely, *Tamas*, *Rajas*, *and Sattva*.
  - According to this school, a person can attain salvation through the acquisition of real knowledge and his participation in the life cycle can be ended forever. This knowledge can be acquired through *pratyaksha* (perception), *anumanya* (inference), and *shabda* (hearing).
  - Emphasises that it is self-knowledge that leads to liberation and not any exterior influence or agent. Self-knowledge can be attained by the means of concentration and meditation.
  - Samkhya forms the philosophical basis for Yoga. In

Samkhya, the necessity of God is not felt for epistemological clarity about the interrelationship between higher Self, individual self, and the universe around us. According to this philosophy, the presence of divine agency is not essential for the creation of the world as the world owes its creation and evolution more to the nature or Prakriti than to God.

- b. *Yoga* : The Yoga school founded by Patanjali, which presents a practical path for the realisation of the self based on the method of physical and mental discipline by releasing *Purusha* from *Prakriti*.
  - Practice of control over pleasure, senses and bodily organs is central theme of this school.
  - In order to attain salvation, physical exercises in various *asanas* (postures) and *pranayama* (breathing exercises) are prescribed. It is believed that through these exercises, the mind gets diverted from worldly matters and achieves concentration. Yoga describes energy flowing through energy channels and concentrated in *chakras*.
    - *Hatha Yoga*: Hatha Yoga is about creating a body which is not a hurdle in one's life. The body becomes a stepping stone—not a hurdle, not a roadblock—in one's progress.
    - *Raja Yoga*: Classical yoga and *Astanga yoga* is a form of meditation which enriches the mind, wherein it is trained to stay focused at one point. It aims at the calming of the mind using a succession of steps, ultimately culminating in *samadhi*.
  - Yoga does not require belief in God, although such a belief is accepted as help in initial stage of mental concentration and control of mind. It thus admits the existence of God as a teacher and guide.
- c. *Nyaya*: Also known as School of Analysis, which developed as a system of logic by Gautama. Its principles are mentioned in *Nyaya Sutras*.
  - Nyaya Philosophy believes in the supremacy of logic and

adopts a scientific approach as it holds that nothing is acceptable unless it is in accordance with reason and experience.

- Nyaya states that the world is real and the philosophy does not follow a monist view.
- This school advocates the theory of *pramanas* (proofs), which are the means of obtaining true knowledge. According to it, the *pradhan pramana* or principal means of obtaining knowledge is *pratyaksha pramana* (knowledge obtained through the five senses). There are also other pramanas like *anumana* (inference, through which we can obtain true knowledge) and *shabda pramana* (a statement of an expert).
- Many later philosophers claimed to belong to this school. For instance, Vatsyayan (who wrote *Nyaya Bhashya*), Udayan (who wrote *Kusumanjali*), and so on.
- d. *Vaisheshika*: This school propounded by Kannada gives importance to discussion of *dravya* or material elements.
  - This school propounded the atomic theory and can be marked as the beginning of the physics in ancient India. Earth, water, fire, air, and ether (sky) are the aggregates, which combined give rise to new objects.
  - It signifies a realistic and objective way of looking at the universe.
- e. *Mimansa*: Also called *Purva Mimamsa* which literally signifies the art of reasoning and interpretation.
  - According to Mimamsa, the Vedas contain the eternal truth. In order to attain salvation, it strongly recommends the performance of *yagya* (Vedic sacrifices), which needed the services of the priests and legitimised the social distance between the different varnas.
  - This philosophy relies on the *Brahmanas* and the *Samhitas* of the Vedas. It is often argued that the *Brahmanas* wanted to maintain their ritual authority and preserve social hierarchy through the propagation of Mimamsa.
- f. *Vedanta* : Also known as *Uttara Mimamsa*. Vedanta signifies

the end of the Veda. The *Brahmaputra* of Badarayana compiled in the 2nd century BCE formed its basic text.

- According to Vedanta, the world is *Maya* (illusion) and there is only one reality, *Brahman*. Therefore, it lays emphasis on *brahmagyan*, and relies on the Upanishads. While Purva Mimansa discusses the fire sacrifices of the Vedic rituals in the Samhitas and the Brahmanas, Vedanta throws light on the esoteric teachings of the Aranyakas (the forest scriptures) and the Upanishads.
- Vedanta has its roots in Samkhya Philosophy. The self or the *atman* (soul) is identical with *brahman*, and hence if a person acquires the knowledge of the self, he acquires the knowledge of brahman and thus attains salvation.
- Both *brahman* and *atman* are eternal and indestructible.
- The theory of *karma* is closely linked to Vedanta philosophy, which signifies that in his present birth a person has to bear the consequences of his actions performed in his previous birth.
- The core message of Vedanta is that every action must be governed by the discriminating faculty that is the intellect. The mind can make mistakes, but the intellect lets us know if the action is in our interest or not.
- There are three sub-branches for Vedanta:
  - Absolute Monism or Advaita/non-dualist Vedanta of Shankara: Shankara was a major proponent of Vedanta in the 9th century. He considers *brahman* to be without any attributes and considers knowledge or *jnana* to be the chief means of salvation. Shankara argues that the *atman* is completely identical with *brahman*. He believed in only one reality. According to Shankara, *the atman experiences a false sense of plurality and individuality under the influence of the delusive power of maya*. While maya has the ambiguous ontological status of being neither real nor unreal, the only true reality is *brahman* which is pure consciousness, eternal and unchanging.

According to him, God and the created world are one and differences arise due to ignorance. He identifies two levels of reality—conventional reality and absolute reality. For instance, *he explains that a person looks at a coiled rope and thinks that it is a snake*. The rope seems like a real snake but it is not. Thus, ignorance is the reason for this mistake of taking conventional reality for absolute reality. The way for salvation is devotion to God and understanding the oneness of the atman with the brahman.

- *Visistadvaita Advaita* or qualified monism/nondualism of Ramanuja: Ramanuja wrote a commentary on Vedanta in 12th century and combined Vaishnava *bhakti* with Upanishadic monism. He identifies the brahman with Vishnu, holding that *brahman* is *saguna* (possesses attributes), in contrast to Sankara's attributeless or *nirguna brahman*. The road to salvation lies in practising devotion or loving faith. Ramanuja asserts that the relationship between *brahman* and the *atman* is similar to relationship of a red rose and redness. *Just as the red rose cannot exist without redness, similarly brahman cannot exist without the atman.* Hence, according to Ramanuja, *atman* and *brahman* are distinct but inseparable.
- Dvaita of Madhva: The Dvaita or dualist school of Hindu Vedanta philosophy originated in 13th century South India with Sri Madhvacharya (Madhva). Madhva wrote commentaries on the Brahmasutra and Upanishads, and a work called the *Bharatatatparyanirnaya*, based on the *Puranas* and the epics. He considers God to be completely different from the individual soul and the world. He asserts that the individual soul has many defects, but it can attain near perfection by worshipping God.

According to him, the relationship between God and the soul can best be described as a relationship between the master and servant. Madhva and his followers call their system *tattvavada* (the realist viewpoint). Madhva maintains that *even though living beings and inert matter are dependent upon brahman, such dependence differentiates them from Him and makes them discrete entities* (*tattvas*). Thus, reality in Madhva's system consists of three basic elements: God, the souls (*jivasi*), and insentient matter (*jada*). He views Vishnu as preeminent above all other deities on the basis of his unique characteristics.

It is interesting to note that the first four classical schools are not entirely based on Vedas but the last two, the Mimansa and Vedanta, certainly rely on the Vedas.

### **Heterodox Schools of Indian Philosophy**

Heterodox schools or unorthodox (*nastika*) schools of Indian philosophy do not accept the authority of the Vedas. The following are the heterodox schools :

#### **Charvaka/Lokayata**

Its founder was Charvaka, the author of the *Barhaspatya Sutras* in the final centuries before the Common Era. It is characterised as a materialistic and atheistic school of thought. Lokayata refers to ideas derived from common people and it underlines the importance of intimate contact with the world (*loka*), while showing a lack of belief in the other world. It accepts direct perception as the surest method to prove the truth of anything. It thus recognises earth, water, fire, and air, but not ether, as it cannot be known by perception. Charvaka insists on joyful living and is opposed to the quest for spiritual salvation. He denies the existence of any divine or supernatural agency and accepts

the existence /reality of only those things which could be experienced by human senses and organs. Thus, there was a clear lack of faith in the existence of *brahman* and God. According to Charvaka, the *Brahmanas* manufactured rituals for acquiring *dakshina* (gifts).

## THE ISLAMIC CONQUEST OF NORTH INDIA AND THE GANGETIC PLAINS

### **Rise And Spread Of Islam**

In the 7th century CE, a new religion called Islam was founded in Arabia by Muhammad (c.570–632 CE), an Arab merchant from the city of Mecca who would later be known as the Prophet Muhammad. In a very short span of time, Islam carved out an empire extending from North Africa to the Iberian Peninsula, to Iran and India. This religion transformed the religious, political, and social life, not only of the people of Arabia but also of many other parts of the world. Islam lays an emphasis upon the belief in one God (Allah) and its holy book, the Quran, which is considered as the supreme authority in Islam as, according to Muslims, it was revealed by Allah to the Prophet Muhammad. Every Muslim is asked *to pray five times a day, to fast during the month of Ramzan (or Ramadhan), to distribute alms, and to make a pilgrimage to Mecca once in their lives*, if possible.

### **A Brief History of Islam**

In c. 613 CE, Muhammad found himself receiving messages from Allah, and learned that he was a prophet in the same line as Moses and Jesus Christ. At first, the pagan Arabs were tolerant, but gradually, when Muhammad began insulting the traditional Pagan deities and insisted that the pagan Arabs and their ancestors will burn in hell for eternity for

worshipping false gods, they began to regard Muhammad and his followers with disdain and placed a trade embargo on them. Muhammad was ridiculed in public. The slaves who followed him were beaten by their pagan masters. In order to escape this persecution, Muhammad and his followers fled from Mecca to Medina in c. 622 CE, where they were welcomed by the local pagan and Jewish tribes. From his new base in Medina, Muhammad sent his followers out to raid the merchant caravans of the pagan Arabs. In response, the pagans began guarding their caravans with armed soldiers. In c.624 CE, the Muslims attacked and defeated a heavily guarded merchant caravan and took many of the pagans captive. This incident is known as the Battle of Badr and was the first major battle in the Muslim conquest of Arabia. Till c. 628 CE, Muhammad expanded his territorial control over the area to the north of Medina and waged war with a number of both pagan and Jewish Arab tribes. Muhammad promised his followers eternal paradise in the afterlife if they fought for his cause. As Muhammad's power and influence grew, his relations with the three Jewish tribes of Medina began to deteriorate, and Muhammad expelled the first two tribes (namely, the Banu Qaynuqa in c.624 CE and the Banu Nadir in c.625 CE) from Medina and then massacred the final tribe (the Banu Qurayza in c.627 CE). In c. 630 CE, Muhammad conquered his hometown of Mecca and over the next two years he sent his armies all over Western Arabia to conquer the remaining Pagan tribes. Muhammad demolished the Pagan temples and accepted their surrender only when they agreed to convert to his new religion.

After the death of the Prophet in c. 632 CE, the task of providing religious and political leadership to the Muslims passed on to the Caliphs (Islamic leaders) known as the Rashidun (rightly guided). The word Caliph is derived from the Arabic word 'Khalifa', which means 'deputy', and was the title given to the rulers who succeeded Prophet Muhammad. Between c.632 and 661 CE, there were four pious Caliphs, all close companions of the Prophet. The policy of the Rashidun Caliphs was to continue Muhammad's aggressive territorial expansion. The first of these companions to be appointed Caliph was Abu Bakr, who was one of Muhammad's father-in-law and had been the first man after

Muhammad to convert to Islam. Abu Bakr's first task was to suppress a rebellion in Arabia (Wars of Apostasy) that had been started by various Arab tribes that had renounced their conversion to Islam after the death of Muhammad. Once these wars were completed, Abu-Bakr began the invasion of the two major super powers of the region, the Byzantine Empire of the Mediterranean, and the Sassanid Empire of Persia. Both of these empires were in a weak state, having been in almost continuous war with each other for an entire century and were unable to mount much effective resistance. Abu Bakr died in c. 634 CE and leadership passed to the next Caliph Umar, another early convert to Islam who had spent 17 years at Muhammad's side. During the Caliphate of Umar, Muslim armies conquered almost the entire Middle East, including the Levant, Egypt, and much of Persia. The rest of Persia was conquered under the reigns of the two subsequent Rashidun Caliphs, Uttman and Ali.

The Umayyad Caliphate (c.661–750 CE) succeeded the pious Caliphs. The Umayyad dynasty gave stability and prosperity to the Caliphate and was followed by the Abbasid Caliphate (c.750–1258 CE). During the time of later Abbasids, the Caliphs began to loose political control and independent Sultans (Muslim rulers) emerged in several regions.

### **The Age of conflict (c.1000–1200 CE)**

The period from c.1000 to 1200 CE witnessed many changes both in West and Central Asia, and in northern India as well. The continuous incursions of the Turkish tribesmen from central Asia, the mercenary character of the Turkish soldiers who switched loyalties often and the strife between the different Muslim sects and between the different regions made the period restless and gave it the tag of the 'age of conflict'. Towards the end of this period, there were a series of incursions of the Turks into northern India.

As a part of the expansion policy of the Umayyad Caliphate, the invasions started as early as the 8th century in India. Moreover, Arabs were also attracted by the wealth promised by India, since Arab

merchants and sailors boasted of the great wealth of the Indian territories that they had witnessed in their journeys. In c.712 CE, Arabs invaded India from the north-west region (Sindh) under Muhammad bin Qasim, who was a general of the Umayyad caliphate. However, the reason for the invasion of Sindh was to avenge the plunder of Arab Ships by the pirates of Debal. When King Dahir refused to punish the pirates, Hajjaj (the governor of Iraq) despatched an army under his nephew and son-in-law Muhammad bin Qasim. He arrived in Sind in c.712 CE, and besieged Debal, which was situated on the sea coast. Then he annexed Nerun (Hyderabad) and Siwistan (Sehwan), followed by a decisive victory over King Daher at the fort of Raor near his capital Alor. Susequently, Alor, Brahmanabad, and Multan (near Indus river and parts of lower Punjab) were taken. The invading Arabs also killed a large number of fleeing soldiers. This military conquest is mentioned in the *Chachnama*, which is an early 13th century Persian translation of an old Arabic history of bin Qasim. Though his rule lasted only for two years, yet it greatly disturbed the economic life of Sindh and a large number of people and merchants fled from Sindh. However, many Arabs settled down in Sindh and the Arab influence continued for a long period.

### **The Ghaznavids and Mahmud of Ghazni**

By the end of the 9th century CE, the Abbasid Caliphate was in decline and a large number of states under Islamised Turks were beginning to emerge. It is interesting to note that during the 9th century, the Turks had entered the Abbasid empire as palace guards and mercenary soldiers but they soon emerged as king-makers. These new rulers assumed title of *amir ul umra* (commander of commanders) at first, and later, Sultan. Towards the end of the 9th century, Trans Oxiana, Khorasan, and parts of Iran were being ruled by the Samanids, who were Iranians by descent. The Samanids had frequent battles with Turkish tribesmen on their northern and eastern frontiers. It was during this struggle that a new type of soldiers known as the Ghazi emerged, who were fighters as well as missionaries. They acted as auxiliaries of

the regular armies, and in lieu of regular salaries took recourse to plunder. The Ghazis took on the Turks in tough battles. In the course of time, many Turks became Muslims themselves, and these Islamised Turkish tribes emerged as the greatest defenders and crusaders of Islam. In the 9th and 10th centuries, most of Afghanistan was under the control of the Samanids. Among the Samanid governors was a Turkish slave, Alptagin, who started as the governor of Balkh and in course of time established an independent Turkish dynasty with its capital at Ghazni, Afghanistan. He was succeeded by his slave and son-in-law, Subuktagin, who established his own rule in Ghazni in 977 CE. The Samanid kingdom soon ended, and the Ghaznavids took over the task of defending the Islamic lands from the central Asian tribesmen. In these circumstances, Subuktagin's son Mahmud ascended the throne (c.998– 1030 CE) at Ghazni (the present day South Kabul). He was 27 years old then, and the first ruler to get the title of "Sultan". Due to his stout defence against the central Asian Turkish tribal invaders, he was considered a hero of the Islamic people by medieval Muslim historians. He was also closely associated with the renaissance of the Persian (Iranian) spirit. In fact, Persian renaissance writer Firdausi was the poet laureate at the court of Mahmud, who glorified the ancient Iranian heroes. The Persian language and culture now became the language and culture of the Ghaznavid empire. Even Mahmud himself claimed descent from the legendary Iranian king, Afrasiyab. Thus, the Turks became not only Islamised but Persianised too. However, while Mahmud played an important role in the defence of the Islamic states against the Turkish tribes and in the Persian cultural renaissance, he plundered and destroyed Indian territory during his invasions.

Muhammad bin Qasim (c. 712 CE)

– First Muslim invader who invaded Sindh.

The Ghaznavids

Subuktagin (c. 977–998 CE)

– Hindu Shahi king, Jayapala, who held territories extending from Punjab and modern Afghanistan, was first to realise the danger posed by the Ghaznanids. He thus invaded Ghazni in alliance with the son of the former governor of

Ghazni, but he had to suffer defeat and Subuktagin succeeded in forcing him into a humiliating treaty.

Mahmud of Ghazni (c.998–1030 CE)

- During the period between c.1000 – 1027 CE, he attacked India 17 times. He started his invasions in India during the period when the Rajput power had declined. The main reasons behind conquest of India by Mahmud Ghazni were:
  - Firstly, to accumulate the vast amount of wealth that existed in India. With the help of that wealth, he wanted to transform Ghazni, his capital city, into a region of formidable power in the entire central Asia. Also, with the help of his plundered wealth from India, he continued his struggle against his enemies in central Asia. As a matter of fact, his raids into India alternated with his battles in central Asia.
  - Secondly, to spread Islam and to destroy Hindu temples. In fact, he is also known as *shikan* or destroyer of images.
  - He also did not want to give time to the rulers in India to regroup and combine against him.
- It has been analysed that he always attacked India during the hot summer season. With the onset of monsoons, he would go back to Ghazni, probably to avoid the flooding rivers of Punjab so that his forces would not get trapped there.
- In c.1000 CE, he first invaded modern Afghanistan and Pakistan and defeated the Hindu Shahi ruler Jayapala in the Battle of Waihind. It is believed that Jayapala burnt himself in the funeral pyre, unable to bear his disgrace.
- In the years c. 1004–06 CE, Mahmud of Ghazni attacked the rulers of Multan.
- In c.1008 CE, the Second Battle of Waihind between Mahmud of Ghazni and Anandapala (son of Jayapala) was fought near Peshawar. Even though Anandapala was supported by the Sultan of Multan and many princes of

north-western India, like the rulers of Kannauj and Rajasthan and the *Khokhars* (a brave war tribe of Punjab), and despite his forces being numerically larger, he lost the war. One of the major reasons behind Mahmud's success was his fast moving cavalry, in comparison to the slow Indian troops, which were mainly driven by elephants. Strategically, he annexed Punjab to have easy access to India.

- In c.1014 CE, Mahmud took Thaneshwar (near Delhi) and burnt the temple of Mathura.
- In c.1018 CE, he sacked Kannauj by defeating its Chandella king, Vidhyadhara. In the same year he defeated and killed two more rulers, Hindu Shahi Trilochanapala and his son Bhimapala, thereby conquering Rahib and Lahore.
- In c.1025 CE (his 16th expedition), he plundered the Somnath temple dedicated to Shiva in Kathiawar, Saurashtra. Mahmud captured the city after grim struggle, in which more than 50,000 defenders lost their lives. It is pertinent to note that Mahmud left Somnath after a fortnight when he came to know that the Chalukayan ruler of Gujarat, Bhima I, had completed preparations to confront him. It was Bhima I who repaired the Somnath temple.
- In c.1026 CE, he returned and punished Jats for colluding against him.
- He patronised three important people:
  - Al Biruni – The scholar from central Asia, and the composer of the *Kitab-ul-Hind*
  - Firdausi – The Persian poet called the *Homer of the East*, writer of the *Shahnama*
- Utbi – The court historian of Mahmud of Ghazni, writer of the *Kitab-ud-Yamni*

In c.1030 CE, Mahmud died, and following his death a powerful empire called the Seljuk empire came into being. This empire included Syria, Iran, and Trans-Oxiaea, and contended with the Ghaznavids for the

control of Khorasan. In a famous battle, Masud, the son of Mahmud, was completely defeated and he had to flee to Lahore for refuge. The Ghaznavid empire was now confined to Ghazni and the Punjab. Although the Ghaznavids continued to make plundering raids into the Gangetic valley and Rajputana, they were no longer in a position to pose a serious threat to India. In the field of culture, a process of interaction between Islam and Hindu religion and society started. Lahore emerged as a centre of Arabic and Persian language. Muslim traders helped in augmenting the India's trade with the central and west Asian countries. Muslim religious preachers called the Sufis emerged during this era, who preached the message of love and humanity to all and were widely respected by both Hindus and Muslims.

Though the 17 invasions of India undertaken by Ghazni did not show any systematic effort to conquer the sub-continent, yet they proved very costly to Indian sub-continent. They not only exposed the inherent military weaknesses of Indian rulers but Ghazni's conquests, especially with the inclusion of Punjab and Afghanistan in his kingdom, made the Indian frontiers weak. His conquest opened the gates of India to be conquered from the north-west and this made it easier for other Afghan and Turkish rulers to enter India into the Gangetic valley at any time. One such ruler was Muhammad Ghori.

### **The Ghurid Dynasty and Muhammad Ghori**

Many historians assert that the actual founder of the Islamic Empire in India was Shahabuddin Muhammad (also known as Mui'zz ud-din Muhammad bin Sam), popularly called Muhammad Ghori, who was the Sultan of the Ghurid empire along with his brother Ghiyath ud-din from c.1173–1202 CE, and the supreme ruler of the Ghurid empire from c.1202–1206 CE. He was one of the greatest rulers of the Ghurid dynasty, and is credited with laying the foundation of Muslim rule in not only in India but also South Asia, that lasted for several centuries. His kingdom included parts of modern-day Afghanistan, Bangladesh,

Iran, India, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.

**Muhammad Ghori**

#### **Brief background of Ghurid Dynasty**

We had just discussed about the establishment of the Seljuk empire which eclipsed the Ghaznavids. However, towards the middle of the 12th century, another group of Turkish tribesmen who were partly Buddhist and partly pagan, shattered the power of the Seljuk Turks. In this vacuum, two new powers rose to prominence, the Khwarizmi empire based in Iran, and the Ghurid empire based in Ghur in northwest Afghanistan. The Ghurids had started as vassals of Ghazni but they soon overpowered them. The power of the Ghurids increased under Sultan Alauddin who earned the title of *jahan-soz* (the world burner) since he ravaged Ghazni and burnt it to ground in revenge for the treatment that had been meted out to his brothers at Ghazni. The rising power of the Khwarizmi empire severely limited the central Asian ambition of the Ghurids. Khorasan (in Western Asia), which was the bone of contention between the two, was soon conquered by Khwarizm

Shah. This left no option for the Ghurids but to look for the expansion towards India.

In c.1173 CE, Muhammad. Ghori ascended the throne at Ghazni while his elder brother was ruling at Ghur. Ghori, being a very ambitious ruler, was not satisfied with only Ghazni and wanted to expand his empire to get hold of more power and control. He was well aware of India's political, religious, social, and military weaknesses and also the enormous wealth that India had. He also had the desire to spread Islam in India Thus, for all these reasons, he carried out a number of invasions to establish his rule over India. It is pertinent to note that unlike Mahmud of Ghazni, Muhammad Ghori was very much interested in establishing a permanent empire in India and not merely looting its wealth. His campaigns were well organised and whenever he conquered any territory, he left a general behind to govern it in his absence. His invasions resulted in the permanent establishment of the Turkish Sultanate in the region lying north of the Vindhya Mountains. However, *as a warrior Mahmud of Ghazni was a more successful one, as he never suffered defeat in India or central Asia while Muhammad Ghori's political achievements in India were greater than that of Mahmud*. However, the political and military motives of the two were very different.

Mohd. Ghori (c.1173–1206 CE)

- Real founder of the Islamic empire in India. There were as many as seven major invasions of Muhammad Ghori against India, and mostly he emerged as the winner.
- Conquest of Multan and Upper Sindh (c.1175–1178 CE): In c. 1175 CE, he led his first expedition against Multan, which was largely successful. In the same campaign, he captured Uchch (in Upper Sindh) from the Bhatti Rajputs and established a fort there.
- Conquest of Gujarat (c. 1178 CE): Three years later, he again marched to conquer Gujarat but the Chalukya ruler of Gujarat, Solanki Bhima II, defeated him at the battle of Kayadara (near to Mount Abu, about forty miles to the north-east of Anhilwara, the capital of Gujarat). But this

defeat did not discourage Muhammad Ghori and he realised the necessity of creating a suitable base in Punjab before venturing on the further conquest of India.

- Conquest of Punjab and Lahore (c.1179–1186 CE): He thus launched a campaign against the Ghaznavid possessions in Punjab. As a result he conquered Peshawar c.1179, Sindh in c.1182 CE Punjab and Lahore in c.11. Thus by c. 1190 CE having secured Multan, Sindh and Punjab, Muhammad Ghori paved his way for a further thrust into the Gangetic Doab.
- First Battle of Tarain (c.1191 CE): Ghori's possession of Punjab and his attempt to advance into the Gangetic Doab brought him into direct conflict with the Rajput ruler, Prithivaraja Chauhan, who had already overrun many small states in Rajputana, captured Delhi and wanted to extend his control over Punjab and Ganga valley. The conflict started with claims of *Tabarhinda* (Bhatinda). In the first battle fought at Tarain (a place near Karnal in the present Haryana), Ghori's army was routed and he narrowly escaped death. Prithviraj conquered Bhatinda but he made no efforts to garrison it effectively. This gave Ghori an opportunity to re-assemble his forces and make preparations for another advance into India.
- Second Battle of Tarain (c.1192 CE): This battle is regarded as one of the turning points in Indian history, as Prithviraj Chauhan was defeated and Ghori emerged successful. Interestingly, the Indian forces were more in number but Turkish forces under Ghori were well organised with swiftmoving cavalry. The bulky Indian forces were no match against the superior organisation, skill, and speed of the Turkish cavalry. It is pertinent to note that the Turkish cavalry used two superior technologies, namely the use of horse shoes (which gave their horses a long life and protected their hooves) and the use of iron stirrups (which gave a good hold to the horse rider and a better striking

power in the battle). A large number of Indian soldiers were killed. Prithviraj escaped, but was captured near Saraswati. He was allowed to rule over Ajmer for some time as the coins pertaining to this period bear legend *"Prithvirajadeva*" on one side and the words *"Sri Muhammad Sam"* on the other. However, soon after, Prithviraj was executed on the charges of conspiracy.

- Capture of Delhi and Ajmer: The Turkish army captured the fortresses of Hansi, Saraswati, Samana, Delhi, and Ajmer.
- Battle of Chandwar (c.1194 CE): Ghori defeated Jaichandra (the ruler of Kannauj) of the Gahadavalas dynasty. Thus, the battles of Tarain and Chandwar laid the foundations of Turkish rule in Northern India. After this invasion, Qutabud-din Aibak was made the viceroy of Muhammad Ghori. After this, Ghori returned to Ghazni to carry out his conquests in the western frontiers, leaving the affairs of India in the hand of his trusted slave general Qutab-ud-din Aibak, who continued his conquests in India.
- Conquests of Gujarat, Bundelkhand, Bengal and Bihar (c.1195–1202 CE): In c. 1195 CE, Qutab-ud-din Aibak, captured Aligarh and Ranthambore. He also attacked Bhima II, the Solanki king of Gujarat who defeated Aibak. Aibak, however, prevailed in his next battle with Bhima II and thus conquered Gujarat. He next conquered Bundelkhand, ruled by the Chandella Rajputs.
- Simultaneously, Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khalji (another general of Muhammad Ghori) conquered Bihar in 1197 CE and Bengal in 1202 CE and destroyed the universities of Nalanda and Vikramshila. Khalji thus became the *viceroy of Bengal* and *Bihar*.
- Revolt of Khokhars (c.1205 CE): Ghori had to again come to India to crush the revolt of the Khokhars.
- However, in 1206 CE, Ghori was killed by someone near Dhamyak district of Jhelum (now in Pakistan) while going
