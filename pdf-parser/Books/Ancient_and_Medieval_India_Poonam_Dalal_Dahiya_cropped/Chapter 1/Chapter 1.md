# 1 ANCIENT INDIA

# PRE-HISTORY PHASE

The English word '**history**' comes from the Greek *historia*, meaning "inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation". It corresponds to the study of the past and throws light on various past events of significance which shaped and evolved human experiences. History is further divided into *pre-history, proto-history,* and *history*. Events occurring before the invention of writing are considered the domain of **prehistory,** which is generally represented by the three stone ages. Defining **proto-history** is rather difficult as it has different connotations. Generally, it refers to a period between prehistory and history, during which a culture or civilisation has not yet developed writing but are mentioned in the written records of a contemporary literate civilisation. For example, the script of the Harappan civilisation remains undeciphered; however, since its existence is noted in Mesopotamian writings, it is considered a part of proto-history. Similarly, the Vedic civilisation from c. 1500–600 BCE had an oral literary tradition, though they did not take to literary writing — they can thus be considered a part of proto-history as well. Archaeologists consider Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures to be a part of protohistory. The study of the past after the invention of writing and the study of literate societies based on the written and archaeological sources constitutes **history**.

The history and identity of human settlements in India go back to prehistoric times. The credit for doing an early extensive study of Indian pre-history go to Robert Bruce Foote, who discovered what was probably the first palaeolithic tool discovered in India — the Pallavaram handaxe. Later, he discovered a large number of pre-historic sites in South India. The contribution of Sir Mortimer Wheeler is equally significant, as his efforts greatly contributed towards our knowledge of

the pre-historical cultures of India and their sequence. On the basis of geological age, the type and technology of stone tools, and subsistence base, the Indian Stone Age is classified primarily into three types:

#### Indian Stone Age\*:

- <span id="page-2-1"></span>• Old stone Age, Palaeolithic Age (5,00,000–10,000 BCE)
- Late Stone Age, Mesolithic Age (10,000–6000 BCE)
- New Stone Age, Neolithic Age (6,000–1000 BCE)

<span id="page-2-0"></span>\*A general time range is specified as there is a great deal of variation in the dates for different sites.

### ▶ Palaeolithic Age (Hunters and Food **Gatherers**

The Palaeolithic Age is the earliest period of the Stone Age, which developed in the Pleistocene period or the Ice Age. It was spread in practically all parts of India **except** the alluvial plains of the Indus and *Ganga*. The Palaeolithic man of India are said to have belonged to the Negrito race and lived in caves and rock shelters. They were food gathering people who lived on hunting and gathering wild fruits and vegetables. They had no knowledge of agriculture, house building, pottery, or any metal. It was only in later stages that they attained the knowledge of fire. **Man**, during this period, used tools of unpolished, undressed rough stones — mainly hand axes, cleavers, choppers, blades, burin, and scrapers. Since the stone tools were made of a hard rock called 'quartzite', Palaeolithic men are therefore also called 'Quartzite men' in India.

**Palaeolithic Tools**

The Palaeolithic Age is divided into three phases according to the nature of stone tools used. They are:

| Early<br>or<br>lower<br>Palaeolithic | Middle<br>Palaeolithic | Late<br>or<br>Upper<br>Palaeolithic |

### **Mesolithic Age (Hunters and Herders)**

![](_page_4_Picture_3.jpeg)

**A Variety of Stone Tools**

The Mesolithic Age represents the intermediate stage in Stone Age Culture. Both Mesolithic and Neolithic Cultures belong to the Holocene era (which succeeded the Pleistocene era around 10,000 years ago). The Mesolithic man lived on hunting, fishing, food gathering, and in later stages, also domesticated animals. One of the key aspects of the Mesolithic Age was the reduction in size of well-established tool types. The characteristic tools of this age were **microliths** (miniature stone tools usually made of crypto-crystalline silica, chalcedony, or chert, both of geometrical and non-geometrical shapes). They were not only used as tools in themselves but also to make composite tools, spearheads, arrowheads, and sickles after hafting them on wooden or bone handles. Some of the other aspects of the Mesolithic Age are:

- Pottery is absent at most Mesolithic sites, but it is present at Langhnaj in Gujarat and in the Kaimur region of Mirzapur (UP).
- The last phase of this age saw the beginning of plant cultivation.
- The Mesolithic era initiated rock art in pre-history. In 1867, the first rock paintings in India were discovered at Sohagighat (Kaimur Hills, UP). Now, over 150 Mesolithic rock art sites have been discovered across India, with rich concentration in Central India such as the Bhimbetka Caves, Kharwar, Jaora, and Kathotia (M.P.), Sundargarh and Sambalpur (Orissa), Ezhuthu Guha (Kerala). Animals dominate the scenes at most Mesolithic rock art sites. However, no snakes are depicted in Mesolithic Paintings.

At some places in south and eastern India, it is as late as 1000 BCE. Its significance in pre-history can be gauged by the fact that V. Gordon Childe termed the Neolithic phase as **Neolithic Revolution**. It introduced a lot of innovations such as:

![](_page_7_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Neolithic Implements**

- (a) **Advent of food production:** The Neolithic man cultivated land and grew fruits & corn like *ragi* and horse gram (*kulathi*). He domesticated cattle, sheep, and goats.
- (b) **Innovations in technology:** The Neolithic man innovated in the production of stone tools, producing implements such as polished, pecked, and ground stone tools. They depended on polished stones other than quartzite for making tools. The use of celts was especially important for ground and polished handaxes. Based on the types of axes used, three important areas of Neolithic Settlements can be identified:
  - (i) North-Western: Rectangular axes with curved cutting edge.
  - (ii) North-Eastern: Polished stone axes with rectangular butt, has occasional shouldered hoes.
  - (iii) Southern: Axes with oval sides and pointed butt.
- (c) **Invention of pottery:** The Neolithic era communities first made pottery by hand and then with the help of the potter's wheel. Their pottery included black burnished ware, grey ware, and mat-impressed ware. It can therefore be said that pottery on a large-scale appeared in this phase.
- (d) **Emergence of self-sufficient village communities:** In the later phases of the Neolithic era, people led a more settled life. They lived in circular and rectangular houses made of mud and reed. They also knew how to make boats and could spin cotton and wool and weave cloth.
- (e) **Division of labour based on sex and age:** As society was progressing,the need for additional labour was recognised and thus labour was procured from other non kin groups too.

Some of the **important excavated Neolithic Sites** along with their **unique aspects** are as follows:

- **Burzahom** (unique rectangular chopper, domestic dogs buried with their masters in graves) and Gufkraal in Jammu and Kashmir (famous for pit dwelling, stone tools, and graveyards located within households)
- Maski, Brahmagiri, Piklihal (proof of cattle herding), Budihal (community food preparation and feasting), and Tekkalakota in

Karnataka

- Paiyampalli in Tamil Nadu and Utnur in Andhra Pradesh
- Garo Hills in Meghalaya, Chirand in Bihar (considerable use of bone implements, especially those made of antlers)
- Saraikhola, near Taxila on Potwar plateau, Amri, Kotdiji and **Mehrgarh** (the earliest Neolithic site known as the Breadbasket of Baluchistan, a province of Pakistan)
- **Koldihwa, in Belan valley** (unique in terms of the presence of a three-fold Neolithic, Chalcolithic and Iron Age settlements), Koldihwa and Mahagara, south of Allahabad (many strata of circular huts along with crude hand-made pottery; earliest evidence of rice cultivation in the world)
- Chopani – Mando, Belan valley (earliest evidence of use of pottery)
- Belan Valley, on the northern spurs of the Vindhyas, and the middle part of the Narmada valley (evidence of all the three phases of Paleolithic settlement, followed by Mesolithic and Neolithic settlements)

## **Chalcolithic Age / Copper-Stone Age (c. 3000−500 BCE)**

The Chalcolithic age marked the emergence of the use of metal along with stone tools. The first metal to be used was copper, though they also occasionally used bronze. Technologically, the Chalcolithic stage largely applies to the settlements of pre-Harappans, but in various parts of country, it appears after the end of the bronze Harappa culture. Some Chalcolithic cultures are contemporary of Harappan culture and some of pre-Harappan cultures, though it is possible to say that most Chalcolithic cultures are post-Harappan. Some prominent sites of pre-Harappan Chalcolithic culture are Ganeshwar, near the Khetri Mines of Rajasthan, Kalibangan in Rajasthan, Banawali in Haryana, Kot Diji in Sindh (Pakistan).

Chalcolithic people domesticated cows, sheep, goats, pigs and buffaloes, and hunted deer. They ate beef but did not like pork and were

also not acquainted with horses. It is rather interesting to note that *the domesticated animals were slaughtered for food and not milked for dairy products* (this practice still continues among the (*Gond people of Bastar*). The people of the Chalcolithic phase produced wheat and rice as their staple, *bajra*, several pulses such as lentil, black gram, green gram, and grass pea, while those living in eastern regions lived on fish and rice. They practiced more slash-burn or *jhum* cultivation. However, neither the plough nor the hoe has been found at any site of this period. They used different types of pottery, of which **black and red pottery** was the most popular. This was made using the potter's wheel and was painted with white line design. Equally interesting is the fact that female potters did not use the potter's wheel, only men did.

Other distinguishing features of people in the Chalcolithic age are as follows:

- They were not acquainted with burnt brick, and generally lived in thatched houses made of mud bricks. There economy was a village-based economy.
- Chalcolithic-era people did not know the use of writing.
- Their villages were small, with huts close to each other.
- Chalcolithic age people cooked their food.
- Small clay images of earth goddesses have been found from Chalcolithic sites. It is thus possible to say that they venerated the Mother Goddess.
- Chalcolithic people were fond of ornaments and decoration. The women wore ornaments of shell and bone and carried finely worked combs in their hair.
- The bull was probably the symbol of their religious cult (based on stylised bull terracottas of Malwa and Rajasthan).
- The Chalcolithic people were expert coppersmiths. They knew the art of copper-smelting and were good stone workers as well.
- They manufactured beads of semi-precious stones such as carnelian, steatite, and quartz crystal.
- They knew spinning and weaving.
- Chalcolithic settlements have been found in south-eastern Rajasthan, western M.P. western Maharashtra, as well as other

parts of southern and eastern India. There are definite regional differences in terms of cereals produced and consumed, pottery made, and so on. For instance, eastern India produced rice, whereas western India cultivated barley and wheat. In Maharashtra, the dead were buried in the north-south direction, whereas in southern India they were buried in the east-west direction. In eastern India, fractional burial was practiced.

- Infant mortality was very high among Chalcolithic people, as evident from the burial of a large number of children in western Maharashtra.
- One can note the beginnings of social inequalities in Chalcolithic societies, as chiefs who lived in rectangular houses dominated others who lived in round huts.

Some of the **important excavated Chalcolithic Sites** along with their **unique aspects** are as follows:

– Ahar (smelting and metallurgy, stone houses) and Gilund (occasional use of burnt bricks) in Banas Valley, Rajasthan

**Remains Found at Ahar Site Rajasthan (Chalcolithic)**

- Nevasa, Jorwe (non-Harappan culture), Navdatoli (cultivated almost all foodgrains), Daimabad (largest Jorwe culture site in the Godavari valley, famous for the recovery of bronze goods), Songaon, Inamgaon (large mud houses with ovens and circular pit houses) and Nasik, Maharashtra
- Chirand, Senuar, Sonpur in Bihar, Mahishdal in West Bengal
- Kayatha (mud-plastered floors, pre-Harappan elements in pottery), Malwa (richest Chalcolithic ceramics, spindle whorls, non-Harappan culture), Eran, M.P. (non- Harappan culture)

### **Questions from last year's Mains**

(1) Mesolithic rock cut architecture of India not only reflects the cultural life of the times but also a fine aesthetic sense comparable to modern painting. Critically evaluate this comment. (2015)
