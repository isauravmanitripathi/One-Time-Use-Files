THE LATER MUGHALS, THE MARATHAS AND OTHER PROVINCIAL KINGDOMS

As we have discussed earlier, even during the long and strong reign of Emperor Aurangzeb, the unity and stability of the Mughal Empire was shaken. However, in spite of these setbacks, the Mughal army and administration was still quite efficient at the time of his death in c.1707 CE. This year is generally referred as the differentiating year to separate the era of the great Mughals from that of the lesser Mughals, also known as the Later Mughals. The Mughal Empire declined rapidly after the death of Aurangzeb and it was in no position to militarily enforce its regulations on the other parts of the empire. As a result, many provincial governors started to assert their authority. Many kingdoms that were earlier subjugated by the Mughals also started proclaiming independence. In due course of time, they gained independent status. The period between c.1707 and 1761 CE (*the time of Aurangzeb's death to the period when the Third Battle of Panipat took place, wherein Ahmad Shah Abdali defeated the Maratha chiefs*) witnessed the resurgence of regional identities and highlighted a sorry state of affairs for the once mighty Mughals. The Mughal court became the scene of factions among the nobles.

In c.1707 CE, when Aurangzeb died, a war of succession broke out among his three surviving sons, Muazzam (the governor of Kabul), Muhammad Kam Bakhsh (the governor of Deccan), and Muhammad Azam Shah (the governor of Gujarat). Finally, Muazzam emerged victorious after defeating Muhammad Azam Shah in the Battle of Jajau, and ascended the throne with the title of Bahadur Shah I.

# THE LATER MUGHALS

Bahadur Shah I/Muazzam/Shah Alam I (c.1707–12 CE)

– Ascended the throne with the title of 'Bahadur Shah', at the age of 63 years.

- He followed a policy of compromise towards the nobles, granting them appropriate territories and postings, pardoning even those nobles who had supported his rivals. However, due to his reckless grants of *jagirs* and promotions, the position of the state finances worsened. Historians often believe that the real power was in the hands of his *Wazir*, Zulfiqar Khan.
- He adopted a more tolerant attitude towards Hindus. He never abolished the *jizya,* but the efforts to collect the tax were not that steadfast.
- He acknowledged the independence of Mewar and Marwar. However, the settlement did not restore them to becoming fully-committed warriors for the Mughal cause.
- The emperor's policy towards the Marathas was also that of halfhearted conciliation. He released Shahu, but did not recognise him as the rightful Maratha king. Similarly, he granted them *sardeshmukhi* of Deccan, but failed to grant them *chauth* and thus could not satisfy them fully. The Marathas thus continued to fight among themselves as well as against the Mughals in the Deccan.
- He was, however, successful in conciliating Chattrasal, the Bundela chief, and Churaman, the Jat chief, who also joined him in the campaign against the Sikhs. He gave a high *mansab* to Guru Govind Singh, but Banda Bahadur rebelled. During the course of his campaign against Banda Bahadur, he died in c.1712 CE.
- Mughal historians like Khafi Khan gave him the title of *'Shah-i- Bekhabar'.*

Jahandar Shah (c.1712–1713 CE)

- With the death of Bahadur Shah, a new element entered Mughal politics. Now, nobles became direct aspirants to the throne and they used the princes as mere pawns to capture authoritarian positions.
- Jahandar Shah was the first puppet ruler in Mughal India. He ascended the throne because of the support of the most

powerful Iranian Noble and his *Wazir*, Zulfiqar Khan, who had the reins of the executive in his hands.

- Zulfiqar Khan reversed many policies of Aurangzeb and also tried to establish friendly relations with the Rajputs, the Marathas, and different Hindu chieftains. He abolished the *jizya* and accorded *title* of Mirza Raj Sawai on Jai Singh of Ambar and gave the *title* of *Maharaja* to Ajit Singh. He also granted the *chauth* and *sardeshmukhi* of Deccan to Shahu, and also reconciled with Churaman Jat and Chhatrasal Bundela. It was only against Banda Bahadur and the Sikhs that he continued the old policy of suppression.
- Zulfiqar Khan made attempts to improve finances of the empire by checking the reckless grants of *jagirs* and offices. He tried to compel the *Mansabdars* to maintain the official quota of troops. But he is infamous in history for introducing the evil practice of *Ijarah* (revenue farming).
- Lal Kanwar (a dancing girl), Jahandar Shah's favourite lady, dominated the court.

Farrukh Siyar (c.1713–19 CE)

- Brother of Jahandar Shah, who defeated Jahandar Shah at Agra in c.1713 CE.
- He came to the throne with the help of Saiyyad brothers (the king makers), who promoted the policies initiated earlier by Zulfiqar Khan, but had him murdered and appointed themselves to key positions:
  - Saiyyad Abdullah Khan – *Wazir*
  - Hussain Ali Khan – *Mir Bakshi*
- The Saiyyad brothers tried to reconcile with the Rajputs, the Marathas, and the Jats, and were also able to suppress the Sikh revolt. It was during Farrukh Siyar's reign that Banda Bahadur, the Sikh leader, was executed.
- In c.1717 CE, the Emperor heedlessly granted to East India Company many trading privileges, including the exemption from custom duties for its trade through Bengal.

**Farrukh Siyar Granting Trading Privileges**

- Saiyyad brothers completely abolished *jaziya* and also abolished pilgrimage tax at a number of places.
- However, due to the overwhelming powers of Saiyyad brothers, friction arose between Farrukh Siyar and the Saiyyad brothers. The emperor thrice plotted against Saiyyad brothers, but failed to overpower them.
- Finally, in c.1719 CE, the Saiyyad brothers made a settlement with Balaji Vishwanath, by which many concessions were granted to the Marathas in return of their active armed assistance in the struggle for supremacy going on in Delhi. With the help of the Maratha troops, the Saiyyad brothers killed Farrukh Siyar.
- The murder of Farrukh Siyar created a wave of revulsion against the Saiyyads among the various factions of nobility, who were also jealous of their growing power.

#### Rafi-us-Darajat (c.1719 CE)

– Placed by Saiyyad brothers in place of Farrukh Siyar. In fact, the Saiyyad brothers raised to the throne three young princes in quick succession within a short span of eight

months in c.1719 CE.

- Died of consumption (tuberculosis) within four months.
- During his reign, Nikusiyar (grandson of Aurangzeb) revolted and set up himself as Emperor at Agra with the help of Mitrasen (a Nagar Brahmin).

Rafi-us-Daula (c.1719 CE)

- Hussain Ali Khan marched upon Agra and took Nikusiyar as prisoner.
- Given the title of Shah Jahan II.
- Shortest reign; died very quickly as he too suffered from consumption (tuberculosis).

Mohd. Shah Rangeela/ Roshan Akhtar (c.1719–48 CE)

- Son of Jahan Shah (brother of Jahandar Shah), who loved dancing and was himself an expert Kathak dancer.
- Under the leadership of the Nizam-ul-Mulk, Chin Qilich Khan, and his father's cousin Muhammad Amin Khan, he was successful in dislodging the Saiyyad brothers in c.1720 CE. Hussain Ali was murdered and Abdullah Khan was made a prisoner. He appointed Mohd. Amin Khan (who had killed Hussain Ali) as *wazir* under title of *Itmad-ud-Daula*.
- However, autonomous states emerged under his reign:
  - Nizam-ul-Mulk – Deccan
  - Saadat Khan – Awadh
  - Murshid Quli Khan – Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa
- The weakness of the empire was exposed when Nadir Shah not only invaded India but also imprisoned the Mughal Emperor and looted Delhi in c.1739 CE.
  - Nadir Shah Invasion (c.1739 CE): Nadir Shah was the Emperor of Iran who rose from being the son of poor shepherd to a national hero by driving the Afghans out of Iran.

**Nadir Shah**

- Reasons for invasion:
  - Mohd. Shah Rangeela suddenly withdrew his ambassador from the Persian court and snapped all diplomatic ties with that country after Nadir Shah came to power in c.1736 CE. He sent three envoys to the Mughal court and his third envoy was detained by Rangeela, which probably infuriated him.
  - Also, Rangeela gave shelter to some Afghan nobles who had escaped from Nadir Shah when he had invaded Afghanistan.
  - Nizam-ul-Mulk and Saadat Khan sent special messages to Nadir Shah inviting him to invade India.
- Course of Nadir Shah's Invasion:
  - He captured Jallalabad, Peshawar, and proceeded towards Lahore.
  - Zakariya Khan, the governor of Lahore, surrendered without much fight.

- Nadir struck a gold coin and read *khutba* in his name.
- Nadir and Mohd. Shah met at Karnal on c.1739 CE, but Mohd. Shah was defeated and he agreed to pay an indemnity of Rs. 25 crore, and trans-Indus provinces including Sindh, western Punjab, and Kabul were ceded to him. Nadir Shah's troops remained in the capital until the money was paid and indulged in a gruesome massacre of the general population, including women and children at Delhi.
- He also took away the famous Kohinoor Diamond.
- He was an able general and administrator, but an inhumane butcher in the course of war.
- Ahmad Shah Abdali raided the kingdom for the first time during his reign as well.

Ahmad Shah (c.1748–57 CE)

- Born to Mohd. Shah Rangeela (only son) through a dancing girl named Kudsiya Begam.
- Ahmad Shah Abdali invaded Delhi many times, and Punjab along with Multan was ceded to him.

**Ahmad Shah Abdali**

- The Marathas snatched Malwa and Bundelkhand.
- It is believed that his *Wazir*, Imad-ul-Mulk, had him blinded and imprisoned him at Salimgarh.

Alamgir II (c.1754–59 CE)

- Son of Jahandar Singh.
- Repeated invasions of Ahmad Shah Abdali.
- The famous Battle of Plassey (c.1757 CE) was fought during his tenure

![](_page_8_Picture_6.jpeg)

#### **Battle of Plassey**

– He was also murdered by his *Wazir* Imad-ul-Mulk.

Aligauhar/Shah Alam II (c.1759–1806 CE)

- His power was so depleted during his reign that it led to a saying in Persian, ''*Sultanat-e-Shah Alam, Az Dilli ta Palam'',* meaning, "*The kingdom of Shah Alam is from Delhi to Palam*", Palam being a suburb of Delhi.
- Due to the fear of his *Wazir*, he remained a refugee with Shuja-ud- Daula of Awadh from c.1761 CE until 1764 CE. He did not return to Delhi till c.1771 CE, when the Marathas re-established their hold and invited him to the capital.
- The Third Battle of Panipat (c.1761 CE) was fought during his reign (between the Marathas and Ahmad Shah Abdali).

– He also participated in the Battle of Buxar *(*c.1764 CE) along with the combined armies of Mir Qasim, the Nawab of Bengal, and Shuja-ud- Daula, the Nawab of Awadh, against the British East India Company. But he was defeated and was forced to sign the Treaty of Allahabad (c.1765 CE), under which the *Diwani (right to collect revenue) of Bengal (which included Bihar and Odisha) was granted to the British East India Company.*

Akbar II (c.1806–1837 CE)

- Remained only under British protection as in c.1803 CE, the British had captured Delhi.
- He conferred the title of 'Raja' on Ram Mohan Roy.
- He was a great poet and is credited with the introduction of the Hindu–Muslim unity festival *Phool Walon Ki Sair.*

Bahadur Shah II/Zafar (c.1837–57 CE)

– The last Mughal Emperor who was more a nominal head than anything else, as the Mughal Empire existed in name only and his authority was limited only to the city of Delhi (Shahjahanbad).

![](_page_10_Picture_0.jpeg)

**Bahadur Shah Zafar**

- He was an accomplished Urdu poet using 'Zafar' (meaning victory) as his pen name, and wrote many Urdu *ghazals*.
- Participated in the revolt of c.1857 CE; after the revolt, he was deported to Rangoon, where he died in c.1862 CE.

# DECLINE OF THE MUGHALS

The causes for the decline and the downfall of the Mughal Empire was the combination of varied political, social, and economic factors.

- a. Weak Successors: None of Aurangzeb's successors could give any stability to the empire. They were absolutely inefficient and most of them were puppets in the hands of powerful nobles who ran the administration on their behalf. None of them had the ability to overcome the centrifugal forces to unite the empire. The wars of succession that plagued Delhi from c.1707 to 1719 CE too weakened the empire.
- b. Role of Nobility: A major factor for the disintegration of the

Mughal Empire was the infighting between the nobles. They had assumed a lot of powers and the course of politics and state activities were guided by their individual interests. The Mughal court consisted of four groups of nobles: the *Turanis*, the *Iranis*, the *Afghans*, and the *Indian born Muslims*. The accession of weak rulers at the centre made them strong contenders for power. They fought amongst themselves for more *jagirs* and high offices, which were limited in number. They thus weakened the military by amassing income from the *jagirs* for themselves and cutting down the number of troops.

- c. Ineffective Mughal Army, Neglect of Naval Power, and Foreign invasions: The Mughal army gradually became inefficient and demotivated after losing many important battles. The neglect of naval power by the Mughals also cost them dearly. Further, the external invasions of Nadir Shah and Ahmad Shah Abdali not only took a heavy toll of the imperial treasury but also laid open the inefficiencies of the military and political administration.
- d. Lack of Strong finances: Due to the emergence of many autonomous states, the revenue sources depleted, and due to continuous wars the treasury was further emptied.
- e. Orthodox rule of Aurangzeb: To some extent, the religious and Deccan policies of Aurangzeb contributed to the empire's decline. He was ambitious and wanted to increase the geographical limits of his empire without taking into consideration the practicability of such moves. His hard-headed attitude towards the Marathas, Rajputs, and the Jats turned away the loyal warriors, and he went on making more enemies without having strong alliances. His religious policy too alienated the Hindus, which certainly had an adverse effect on the stability of the empire.

# RISE OF REGIONAL POLITICS AND STATES

The gradual weakening of the central Mughal authority resulted in the creation of different provincial kingdoms. The Mughal court also did not oppose the formation of these states as its chief concern at this point of time was to ensure the flow of the necessary revenue from the provinces and the maintenance of at least the semblance of imperial unity.

The states that arose in India during the phase of Mughal decline and the following century (between c.1700 and 1850 CE) varied greatly in terms of their essential character, state resources, and their life span. For instance, a state such as Hyderabad had been in a region where there had been an older regional tradition of provincial states in the immediate pre- Mughal period, whereas many of the other post-Mughal states were based on ethnic or sectarian groupings such as the Marathas, the Jats, and the Sikhs. Each of the contenders in the regions, in proportion to their strength, looked for and seized opportunities to establish their dominance over the others in the neighbourhood. Thus, the regional states of this period can be divided into three categories:

1. States formed by former Mughal Nobles: There were some states whose founders were important high *mansab* Mughal nobles, who, on the basis of their growing strength and administrative ability, established some of the formidable provincial kingdoms. Though, *they had declared independence from Mughal rule, yet they never broke formal ties from the Mughal state*. Some of the prominent states in this category were Awadh, Bengal, and Hyderabad. The founder of the Awadh state was Saadat Khan, whereas the founder of Bengal was Murshid Quli Khan and the founder of Hyderabad state was Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah. All three were former governors of these provinces and powerful members of the Mughal nobility.

An interesting aspect pertaining to administration of these states was that in these states, many reforms were undertaken in the field of revenue assessment and even the *zamindari* system. In these states, revenue was collected in cash with great strictness from all *zamindars*. As a result of this, many *zamindars* had to borrow money and thus there

was rise of the bankers and moneylenders or *mahajans*. Both the state and the landed class depended on them for loans. Gradually, there was a rise in the status of these bankers who not only became powerful but also started to influence the administration. This also resulted in development of a new system known as *Ijaradari* system, under which *the state auctioned its right to collect taxes to the highest bidders known as Ijaredars*, who were usually bankers and *mahajans*. In turn, the state was assured of a fixed income. This system was not promoted during Mughal rule as there were chances that those who collected the tax would collect much more than fixed settled amount, exploiting the peasants, while giving less to the state, thereby causing losses to the state revenue.

- 2. *Watan Jagirs* : The second category of regional states in the 18th century was those states that had already enjoyed a lot of independence during the Mughal rule as *watan jagirs* such as the Rajput states.
- 3. Rebellious States: The third category of regional states was those that had emerged after rebelling against the Mughal authority. The Sikhs, the Marathas, and the Jats belonged to this group, and out of them, the Marathas over the course of time emerged as a formidable power.

# THE MARATHAS

The single most important power that emerged in the fading shadow of the Mughal dynasty was the Marathas. Various factors contributed to the rise of the Marathas in the 16th and 17th centuries. The physical environment of the Maratha country, such as mountainous regions and dense forests, probably resulted in shaping certain peculiar qualities among the Marathas. For instance, this difficult terrain made the Maratha Soldiers expert in guerilla tactics. The Marathas held important positions in the administrative and military systems of Deccan Sultanates of Bijapur and Ahmadnagar, which offered them a first hand experience of administration, further facilitating in the emergence and

organisation of the Maratha state. Also, the spread of the Bhakti movement in Maharashtra under the influence of spiritual leaders like Tukaram, Ramdas, Vaman Pandit, and Eknath fostered social unity among them and the much-required political unity was conferred by Shahji Bhonsle and his son Shivaji. Seizing upon the opportunity of disintegration of the Mughal empire, the Marathas began their northward expansion and overran Malwa, Gujarat, and Bundelkhand, and in due course of time posed a formidable challenge to the authority of the Mughals.

## **Shivaji and Rise of Marathas**

#### Shivaji Raje Bhonsle (c.1674–1680 CE)

– Born in the hill fortress of Shivmer in Poona on February 19, 1630 CE.

![](_page_15_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Shivaji Bonsle**

- Belonged to the Bhonsle clan of Marathas.
- Father – Shahji Bhonsle (was an military commander under the Nizam Shahi ruler of Ahmadnagar, but after the fall of

Ahmadnagar, he had transferred his services to Bijapur).

- Mother- Jijabai.
- Named "Shiva" after the local goddess "Shivai"
- Shivaji was greatly influenced by Jijabai (his mother), Dadaji Kondev (his teacher), Sufi saint Pir Shaikh Yacub, Guru Ramdas, Tukaram (Bhakti Saint), Hazrat Baba of Ratnagiri, the *Ramayana*, and the *Mahabharata* on the development of his personality.
- He started his career as an independent young prince at Poona after inheriting the *jagir* of Poona from his father in c.1637 CE. After the death of his guardian, Dadaji Kondadev in c.1647 CE, Shivaji assumed full charge of his *jagir*.
- In c.1646 CE, he captured Torna *from* the ruler of Bijapur and with the booty he built the fort of Raigarh. He also captured Javli from a Maratha chief named Chanda Rao More. This made him the master of the Mavala region.
- By c.1654 CE, Shivaji had captured forts in the Western Ghats and along the Konkan coast. Shivaji and his elder brother defeated invading armies of Adil Shah and secured the release of their father.
- He also raided Portuguese settlement at Daman and received tribute from them.
- Battle of Pratapgarh (c.1659 CE): Fought between Afzal Khan (represented Adil Shah of Bijapur) and Shivaji, in which Shivaji killed Afzal Khan with his tiger claws and became a local hero. Shivaji's military conquests made him a legendary figure in the Maratha region, and many locals came forward to join his army.
- Battle of Kolhapur: Fought between General Rustemjaman (represented Adil Shah of Bijapur) and Shivaji. The victory of Shivaji alarmed Aurangzeb, but he still considered Shivaji nothing more than a mountain rat.
- Battle of Pavankhind (c.1660 CE): Fought between Siddi Johar (represented Adil Shah of Bijapur) and Shivaji. A

truce was made between Shivaji and Adil Shah through Shahji, thus acknowledging and formally recognising the independence of Shivaji's kingdom.

- In c.1660 CE, Aurangzeb sent the Mughal governor of the Deccan, Shaista Khan, against Shivaji. Shivaji suffered a defeat at the hands of the Mughal forces and lost Poona, but war continued till c.1663 CE. In c.1663 CE, Shivaji carried out a daring night attack on the camp of Shaista Khan, injuring Khan and killing his son. This daring attack affected the prestige of Khan and he was recalled by Aurangzeb and sent to Bengal as punishment.
- In c.1664 CE, Shivaji sacked the rich port of Surat. This plundering of Surat, an important Mughal trading city, enraged Aurangzeb and he sent Raja Jai Singh of Amber and Diler Khan to destroy the Maratha power. They made elaborate preparations and succeeded in besieging the Purander fort, where Shivaji had lodged his family and treasure. Shivaji opened negotiations with Jai Singh and the Treaty of Purander was signed in c.1665 CE. According to this treaty, *Shivaji had to surrender 23 forts to the Mughals out of the 35 forts held by him, and the remaining 12 forts were to be left to Shivaji on the condition of service and loyalty to the Mughal empire.* On the other hand, the Mughals recognised the right of Shivaji to hold certain parts of the Bijapur kingdom. As Shivaji declined from personal service of the Mughals, his minor son Sambhaji was granted a *mansab* of 5000.
- According to some legends, in c.1665 CE, Shivaji visited Agra with his son but were humiliated by Aurangzeb who put them under house arrest. It is believed that his plan was to send Shivaji to Qandahara, but Shivaji escaped along with his son while disguised as a palanquin bearer.
- Aurangzeb was exasperated and he gave him the title of Raja and Jagir of Berar.

- Between c.1667 and 69 CE, Shivaji adopted a low profile and built his army. In c.1670 CE, he recovered most of his lost forts and sacked Surat for the second time.
- He defeated Mughals in the Battle of Salher (c.1672 CE) and crowned himself at Raigarh and assumed the title Maharaja Chattrapati.
- Towards end of c.1676 CE, Shivaji launched a wave of conquests in southern India's Carnatic region and captured the forts of Vellore and Ginjee, which served as the Maratha's capital for nine years.
- He died due to fever in c.1680 CE, at the age of 53, after ruling for only six years. In this short time he founded the Maratha kingdom, which dominated western India for a century and a half.
- Shivaji promoted Sanskrit, but respected all religions and opposed forced conversion.

Sambhaji (c.1681–1689 CE)

- Many Maratha chiefs did not support Sambhaji and instead to Rajaram, the other son of Shivaji. This internal conflict weakened Maratha power.
- Was nicknamed as *'Kalusha'*, meaning Instigator of strife.
- Prince Akbar, the rebellious son of Aurangzeb, took shelter with him and in a pursuing battle at Sangmeshwar in c.1689 CE, he was defeated by the Mughal commander Muqqarrab Khan and was killed along with his personal counselor, Kavi Kalash.
- Widow of Sambhaji, Yesubai could not protect the fort of Raigarh, and she along with her son, Shahu were made prisoners.

Rajaram (c.1689–1707 CE)

- Younger brother of Sambhaji, who never sat on the throne as he claimed that he was ruling on behalf of Shahu.
- Shifted his headquarters to Ginjee. After the Mughals conquered Ginjee, he fled to Vishalgarh and then to Satara,

giving *Hukumat Panha* (King status) to Peshwa Ramchandra Pant.

- During his reign, devoted Maratha leaders like Ramchandra Pant, Prahlad Niraji, and Dhanaji Jadhav created havoc among Mughals.
- Died in c.1700 CE; his widow Tarabai assumed control in the name of her infant son Shivaji II.
- Around same time, Shahu was released by Zulfiqar Khan hoping for a civil war among Marathas. As expected, the Mughals succeeded in dividing the Marathas into two rival camps—one under Tara Bai and the other under Sambhaji's son, Shahu. Tarabai sent Dhanaji Jhadav to oust Shahu from Maharashtra, but Dhanaji was won over by Shahu. In c.1707 CE, with the help of a Chitpavan Brahman named Balaji Vishwanath, Shahu was successful in defeating Tarabai at the Battle of Khed and she went away to Kolhapur, establishing the Royal House of Kolhapur.

Shahu (c.1707–1749 CE)

- During his reign, the states of Satara and Kolhapur came into being. By c.1710 CE, two separate principalities had become an established fact, eventually confirmed by the Treaty of Warna in c.1731 CE.
- The period was also marked by the ascendancy of a lineage of Chitpavan Brahmin ministers, who held the title of *Peshwa* (chief minister) and virtually came to control central authority in the Maratha state, reducing the Bhonsles to mere figureheads. In fact, the first truly prominent figure of this line was Balaji Vishwanath, who had helped Shahu in his rise to power.
- In c.1719 CE, Shahu, under the advice of Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath, assisted the Saiyyad brothers in the execution of Farukkh Siyar and got his mother released. Soon after, he declared *Swaraja*/ the Independence of Maratha land.

Rajaram II/Ramraja (c.1749–1777 CE)

– Adopted son of Shahu, who was presented by Tarabai as the grandson of Rajaram and herself to grab power after Shahu's death. After being sidelined, she stated that he was only an imposter. However, Peshwa Baji Rao retained him as the titular Chattrapati.

The power of the Chhatrapati was almost totally overshadowed by that of the Peshwa.

## **Royal House of Kolhapur**

#### Shivaji II (c.1710–1714 CE)

– Son of Queen Tarabai and Rajaram, and was under the regency of Queen Tarabai.

#### Sambhaji II (c.1714–1760 CE)

- Son of Rajaram from his second wife Rajabai, who deposed Shivaji II and Tarabai.
- He signed the Treaty of Warna in c.1731 CE with his cousin Shahu to formalise the two separate seats of the Bhonsle family.

The British sent expeditions against Kolhapur in c.1765 CE and c. 1792 CE, and the state entered into treaty with the British after the collapse of the Maratha confederacy in c. 1812 CE.

## **The Office of the Peshwa (c.1640–1818 CE)**

The word *'Peshwa'* probably originated in Persian, meaning 'foremost', and was introduced in Deccan by the Muslim rulers. Duties of a Peshwa were equal to that of a Prime Minister.

Sonopant Dabir (c.1640–1652 CE)

– First unofficial Peshwa

Shyampant Kulkarni Ranzekar (c.1652–1657 CE)

– Was Peshwa under Shahji Bhonsle

Moropant Trimbak Pingle (c.1657–1683 CE)

– Was appointed Peshwa by Chhatrapati Shivaji. Moreshwar Pingale (c.1683–1689 CE)

– Was Peshwa under Sambhaji

Ramchandra Pant Amatya (c.1689–1708 CE)

- Peshwa under Rajaram, and when Rajaram had to escape to Ginjee in c.1689 CE, he gave *Hukumat Panha* (King status) to Pant before leaving.
- Was an able administrator as he managed the state under many challenges like the influx of Mughals, betrayal from Vatandars (local *satraps* under Marathas), and socioeconomic challenges like the scarcity of food.
- Acted as "shadow/proxy king", and got military help from great Maratha warriors Santaji Ghorpade and Dhanaji Jadhav.
- In c. 1698 CE, Rajaram offered the post of Peshwa to his wife Tarabai, and he happily stepped down. Tarabai gave him an important position in the senior administration of the Maratha state.
- Wrote *Adnyapatra*, in which he *explained different techniques of war, maintenance of forts, and administration.*
- Since he owed loyalty to Tarabai against Shahuji, he was sidelined after arrival of Shahuji in c.1707 CE.

Balaji Vishwanath Bhatt (c.1713–1719 CE)

- He belonged to the Bhatt family of Shri Vardhan in the Konkan region. He is known in history for making the post of the Peshwa hereditary, and for making the position as one of the most important and powerful ones in the Maratha administration.
- He played a crucial role in the civil war and helped Shahu become the Maratha ruler by seeking the support of all Maratha leaders for Shahu.
- In c.1719 CE, Balaji Vishwanath got certain rights from the then Mughal Emperor, Farrukh Siyar, such as the recognition of Shahu as the Maratha king and the permission to collect *chauth* and *sardeshmukhi* from the six

Mughal provinces of the Deccan, including the Carnatic and Mysore.

- The Chapekar brothers and Nana Sahib belonged to this family.
- Negotiated with Kanhoji Angre (admiral of the navy and an ally of Tarabai) and gradually succeeded in winning over Kanhoji to become the admiral (*Sarkhel*) of Shahu's navy.
- Assisted Saiyyad brothers in dethroning Farrukh Siyar from Delhi.
- Baji Rao I (c.1720–1740 CE)
  - Eldest Son of Balaji Vishwanath who succeeded him as Peshwa at the young age of twenty. He was the most famous of all nine Peshwas and also known as *"Thorale"*, meaning 'Elder' Baji Rao. He was the greatest exponent of guerrilla tactics after Shivaji.

**Balaji Baji Rao**

– During his lifetime, he never lost a battle and the Maratha power reached its zenith under him. He formulated the policy of Northward expansion so that the Maratha flag

would fly from Krishna to Attock.

- He preached and popularised the idea of *Hindu-padpadshahi* (Hindu Empire) to secure the support of the Hindu chiefs against the common enemy, the Mughals.
- His arch rival in Deccan was Nizam-ul-Mulk, who continuously plotted intrigues with the Raja of Kolhapur against Baji Rao and Shahu. Baji Rao, however, defeated the Nizam on both occasions when they fought at Palkhed and Bhopal, and compelled him to grant *chauth* and *sardeshmukhi* of the six provinces of Deccan.
- In c.1722 CE, he captured Salsette and Bassein from the Portuguese.
- He shifted the administrative capital from Satara to Pune in c.1728 CE.
- Two famous lines pertaining to him are:
  - Shahu (to Bajirao): "*You are a worthy son of worthy father*".
  - Bajirao (to Shahu): "*Let us strike at the root and the branches will fall apart themselves*".
- He initiated the system of confederacy among the Maratha chiefs. Under this system, each Maratha chief was assigned a territory that could be administered autonomously. As a result, many Maratha families became prominent and established their authority in different parts of India. They were the Gaekwads at Baroda, the Bhonsles at Nagpur, the Holkars at Indore, the Scindias at Gwalior, and the Peshwas at Poona.

Balaji Baji Rao I/ Nana Sahib I (c.1740–61 CE)

- Balaji Baji Rao succeeded his father as Peshwa at the young age of nineteen and was appointed as Peshwa by Shahuji.
- It was during his reign that the Maratha king Shahu died in c.1749 CE without an issue. His nominated successor, Ramraja, was imprisoned by the Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao at Satara, and the supreme power of Maratha confederacy

passed into the hands of Peshwa (by the Sangola Agreement of c.1750 CE).

- He defeated Bengal Nawab Alivardi Khan and one third of the Indian sub-continent was under the Marathas.
- The Peshwa entered into an agreement with the Mughal Emperor in c.1752 CE. According to this agreement, *the Peshwa gave assurance to the Mughal Emperor that he would protect the Mughal Empire from internal and external enemies for which the chauth of the north-west provinces and the total revenue of the Agra and Ajmer provinces would be collected by the Marathas*.
- Honouring this agreement, Marathas fought the Third Battle of Panipat (c.1761 CE) when Ahmad Shah Abdali invaded India, in which the Marathas were defeated. Many Maratha leaders and thousands of soldiers died in this battle. Balaji Baji Rao also died upon hearing the sad end of this battle.
- The defeat of Panipat checked the expansion of Marathas and fragmented the empire. After the battle, Marathas never fought again as one unit. Also, there were branches of the Bhonsle family that relocated to Kolhapur and Nagpur, while the main line remained in the Deccan heartland, at Satara.

Madhav Rao (c.1761–1772 CE)

- Was a remarkable Peshwa who within a short period of 11 years restored the lost fortunes of the Maratha Empire.
- He defeated the Nizam, compelled Haidar Ali of Mysore to pay tribute, and reasserted control over northern India by defeating the Rohillas and subjugating the Rajput state and Jat chiefs.
- In c. 1772 CE, he brought back Emperor Shah Alam to Delhi.
- Saw the division of Maratha kingdom into semiindependent states. Of these, the most important were the Gaikwads (Gaekwars), the Holkars, and the Scindias.

#### Raghunath Rao (c.1772–1773 CE)

– After Madhav Rao's death (c.1772 CE), struggle for power ensued between Raghunath Rao, the younger brother of Nana Sahib and Narayan Rao, the younger brother of Madhav Rao.

Narayan Rao (c.1772–1773 CE)

– He was killed on Raghunath Rao's orders in c.1773 CE.

Raghunath Rao (c.1773–1774 CE)

– Seized the throne but was not recognised by the Emperor and overthrown.

#### Sawai Madhav Rao (c.1774–1795 CE)

- Son of Narayan Rao, who was merely 40 days old when crowned as Peshwa. The empire was managed by Nana Phadnavis, an able administrator and warrior par excellence with the help of a twelve member regency council called the *Barbhai Council.*
- Out of frustration, Raghunath Rao went to British for help which resulted in the First Anglo–Maratha war (c.1775–82 CE). At the famous battle of Talegaon (c.1776 CE), Nana Phadnavis defeated the British and the famous treaty of Purandhar (c.1776 CE) and the treaty of Salbai (c.1782 CE) were signed. The treaty virtually restored the status quo except the fact that the English retained Salsette and dropped the cause of Raghunath Rao.
- It was after death of Nana Phadnavis in c. 1800 CE that the Marathas could not sustain against the British and could never regain their past glory.

Baji Rao II (c.1796–1818 CE)

- Son of Raghunath Rao and the last Peshwa.
- Weakest and most incompetent Peshwa who signed the humiliating Treaty of Bassein with the British (c. 1802 CE), which gave the British effective control of not only the Maratha region but also of Deccan and western India.
- He was defeated by the East India Company in the Third

Anglo– Maratha War in c.1818 CE after which the Peshwa's territory in central Maharashtra was annexed to the British East India Company's Bombay province and he was pensioned off.

– Nana Sahib (alias Dhondu Pant) was the adopted son of Baji Rao II and he participated in the famous Revolt of 1857.

Even the Marathas could not succeed in preventing the establishment of British power in India. One of the important reasons behind this was that there was lack of unity among the Maratha chiefs like Holkar, Scindia, and Bhonsle. Also, in comparison with British, their army was ill-equipped and still relied on old fighting methods.

## **Maratha Confederacy**

- Peshwas of Poona: Already discussed above.
- The Gaikwads of Baroda: The Gaikwads, who gathered prominence in c.1720 CE, were initially subordinate not only to the Bhonsles but also to the powerful Dabhade family. However, after the death of Shahu, when the power of the Peshwas was further enhanced, the position of the Gaikwads also improved. By the early 1750s, their rights on a large portion of the revenues of Gujarat were recognised by the Peshwa. The Gaikwads thus established their capital at Baroda.
  - In c.1752 CE, they expelled the Mughal governor of the Gujarat province from capital, Ahmedabad, causing realignment in the network of trade and consumption in the area.
  - One of the most prominent rulers was Damaji (c. 1768 CE), who was succeeded by Fateh Singh (c.1771– 89 CE). Fateh Singh broke out of the hold of the Peshwa in the late 1770s and early 1780s, and negotiated a settlement with the English East India Company, which eventually led to increased British interference in his

affairs. Thus, by c.1800 CE, the British instead of the Peshwa were the final arbiters in determining succession among the Gaikwads, who became subordinate rulers under them in the 19th century.

- Sayaji Rao belonging to this dynasty gave scholarship to Dr. Ambedkar.
- The Holkars of Indore: In the case of the Holkars, there was marked and rapid rise in their status and wealth. Though initially they had very little political power, by the c.1730s their prominent ruler, Malhar Rao Holkar, consolidated his position and succeeded in obtaining a large share of the *chauth* collection in Malwa, eastern Gujarat, and Khandesh. Within a short span of time, Malhar Rao consolidated his own principality at Indore, and later his successors controlled the important trade routes as well as the crucial trading centre of Burhanpur. After him, the control of the dynastic fortunes fell largely to his son's widow, Ahalya Bai, who ruled from c.1765 to 1794 CE and brought great glory to the Holkars.
- The Bhonsles of Nagpur: The Bhonsles of Nagpur were clearly subordinate to the Satara rulers. An important ruler from this line was Raghuji Bhonsle (c.1727–55 CE), who was responsible for the Maratha incursions on Bengal and Bihar in the 1740s and early 1750s. He occupied Orissa from Nawab Alivardi Khan.
- The Scindias of Gwalior: The Scindias carved a prominent place for themselves in North India in the decades following the Third Battle of Panipat (c.1761 CE). Like the Holkars, the Scindias were based largely in central India, first at Ujjain, and later (from the last quarter of the 18th century) in Gwalior.
  - During the long reign of Mahadaji Scindia (c.1761–94 CE), an effective and innovative military commander, the family's fortunes were consolidated.
  - Mahadaji organised a powerful European style army

consisting equally of Hindu and Muslim soldiers along with employing a large number of European officers, soldiers, and gunners. He also established his own ordinance factories near Agra.

- The Mughal king Shah Alam II made him the *Naib -i Munaib*, meaning deputy regent of his affairs in the mid-1780s and his influence was noticed not only across the provinces of Delhi and Agra but also on Rajasthan and Gujarat, making him the most formidable Maratha leader of the era. Even the officials of the East India Company were very cautious in dealing with him. But his relations with the acting Peshwa, Nana Phadnavis of Pune, and Holkar of Indore, were fraught with tensions.
- Eventually, the momentum generated by Mahadaji could not be maintained by his successor Daulat Rao Scindia (c.1794–1827 CE), who was defeated by the British and forced to surrender his territories both to the north and to the west.

An interesting point to note here is that Mughal symbols held a special significance even in the phase of Mughal decline. The Mughal system of honours and titles, as well as Mughal-derived administrative terminology and fiscal practices, continued despite the decline of imperial power. For instance, after recapturing Gwalior from the British, Mahadaji Scindia took care to have his control of the town sanctioned by the Mughal emperor. Equally, he zealously guarded the privileges and titles granted to him by Shah Alam, such as *amir* al-umara (head of the amirs) and *na'ib wakii-i mutlaq* (deputy regent). In this case, he was not alone, as instances of states that wholly threw off all pretences of allegiance to the Mughals are found rarely in the 18th century.

## **Shivaji's Administration**

**Administration**

Shivaji was a great administrator who laid the foundations of a sound system of administration. The administrative system of the Marathas was very much influenced by the administrative system of the Mughals and the Deccani states (adopted by Malik Amber of Ahmednagar and Mahmud Gawan of Bahmani Kingdom). The Maratha Kingdom was known as *Swarajya* or *Mulk-e-Kadim*.

(i) Central Administration

The king was the pivot of the government, who was assisted by a council of ministers called the *Ashtapradhan*. Each one was directly responsible to Shivaji and headed a department. Under Shivaji, these offices were neither hereditary nor permanent and were also frequently transferred.

- 1. *Peshwa* – *Pant Pradhan*, who looked after finance and general administration. Later, the office of Peshwa became more powerful and functioned more as the prime minister. There was great focus on Intelligence and a centralised intelligence department was created.
- 2. *Sar-i-Naubat or Senapati* – Military commander, a honorary post.
- 3. *Amatya/Majumdar* – Accountant General.
- 4. *Waqenavis* – Intelligence and police, posts, historical archives, and household affairs.
- 5. *Surnavis or Chitnis or Sachiv* – General Secretary who also overlooked official correspondence.
- 6. *Sumant/Dabir* – Master of ceremonies and Foreign Affairs.
- 7. *Nyayadish* – Justice.
- 8. *Pandit Rao* – Charities and ecclesiastical affairs.

Hierarchy of officers from top to bottom was:

• *Peshwa → Majumdar → Sachiv → Mantri*

It is pertinent to note that all the ministers except *Pandita Rao* and *Nyayadhish* participated in war. The *Ashtapradhan* was not a creation of Shivaji and many of these officers such as *Peshwa, Majumdar, Waqai navis, Dabir,* and *Surnavis* had existed earlier under the Deccani rulers

too. Each of the *Ashtapradhan* was assisted by eight assistants namely *Diwan*, Majumdar, Fadnis (used to respond to the letters of commanders of the forts), *Sabnis*, Karkhanis, Chitnis (dealt with all diplomatic correspondences and wrote all royal letters), *Jamadar*, and *Potnis* (looked after the income and expenditure of the royal treasury).

#### (ii) Provincial and Local Administration

The provincial administration was also patterned largely on the Deccani and Mughal system. Shivaji reorganised and renamed certain provinces. The provinces were known as *Prants*, which were under the charge of the *Subedar*. The *Sarsubedar* used to control and supervise the work of the *subedar*. After *Prants* came the *Tarfs*, which were headed by a *havaldar*. *Mauzas* or villages were the lowest unit of administration. The police officer in rural area was called *Faujdar* and in urban area was called *Kotwal*. Under the Marathas, performance-based Brahmin elites called *Kamvishdar* manned the central bureaucracy and the local administration and used to enjoy wide powers of tax assessment and collection. They kept records, adjudicated cases, and provided information about local conditions to the superior officials. Interestingly, the office of British District Collector was modelled on the *Kamvishdar*.

![](_page_30_Figure_3.jpeg)

Shivaji was a military genius and his army was very well organised. The Marathas were pioneers of commando actions. The regular standing army known as *Paga* consisted of about 30,000 to 40,000 cavalry supervised by the *havaldar*, who were given fixed salaries. The lowest head of the cavalry was called *Naik*. In fact, all the war horses belonged to the state. There were two divisions in the Maratha cavalry:

- 1. Bargirs: Equipped and paid by the state
- 2. *Silahdars*: Maintained by the nobles.

The Marathas were famous for guerrilla warfare, along with the use of an innovative weapon, the *Bagh naka*, meaning tiger claw. The infantry was highly mobile and light, and the Mavli foot soldiers played an important role in the infantry. Interestingly, at the time of exigencies, peasants also functioned as part time soldiers as they used to work for eight months in the field and performed war duty in four months. Shivaji also built a powerful navy. By the end of his reign, Shivaji had about 240 forts and the forts played an important role in the military operations of the Marathas. Each fort was put under the charge of three officers of equal rank (*Sabnis, Kardadar, Sar-i-naubat*) for mutual check and as a precaution against treachery.

#### **Revenue**

The revenue system of Shivaji was also largely based on that of the Mughals and Deccani states such as that of Malik Amber of Ahmadnagar. Land was measured by using the measuring rod called *lathi* and were classified into three categories – paddy fields, garden lands, and hilly tracts. Shivaji drastically reduced the powers of the existing *Deshmukhs* and *Kulkarnis* and appointed his own revenue officials called *karkuns*. Shivaji strongly discouraged revenue farming. The Marathas employed a special script known as the 'Modi script' in the documents of the revenue and administrative records.

*Chauth* and *sardeshmukhi* were two major sources of revenue and it is interesting to note that these taxes were collected not in the Maratha kingdom but in the neighbouring territories of the Mughal empire or Deccan sultanates.

*Chauth:* One fourth (1/4 th of the land revenue) paid to the

- 1. Marathas in order to avoid the Maratha raids.
- 2. *Sardeshmukhi* was an additional levy of ten percent, that is, 1/10 of standard land revenue on those lands on which the Marathas claimed hereditary rights.

With the increasing weakening of the central authority, Murshid Quli Khan, who started his career as the *Diwan* of Bengal (under Aurangzeb), became virtually independent but kept on sending tribute to the Mughal emperor. However, in c.1739 CE, Alivardi Khan deposed the family of Murshid Quli Khan and became the Nawab himself. These Nawabs brought stability and peace to Bengal and at the same time promoted agriculture, trade, and industry. During their reign, equal opportunities were given to both Hindus and Muslims. But the Nawabs could not foresee the long-term implications of the presence of the European trading companies. Their military preparedness was also not up to the mark. From c.1756 to 1757 CE, the successor of Alivardi Khan, Siraj-ud-daulah had to fight the English East India Company over the trading rights. His defeat at the Battle of Plassey in c.1757 CE paved the way for the subjugation of Bengal as well as India by the British.

![](_page_32_Picture_5.jpeg)

The weakened central control of the Mughals also resulted in the emergence of the provincial kingdom of Awadh under governor Saadat Khan Burhan ul Mulk. Saadat Khan not only disciplined the local *zamindars* but also maintained a well-paid, armed and well-trained army. Before his death in c.1739 CE, Saadat Khan made his position as hereditary. His successors, Safdar Jung and Asaf ud Daulah, not only played a very decisive role in the politics of northern India but also gave a long-term administrative stability to the Awadh province. Under the

Nawabs, firstly Faizabad, and then Lucknow emerged as centres of cultural excellence comparable to Delhi in the spheres of arts, literature, and crafts. Regional architecture too reflected itself in the form of Imambarahs and certain other buildings. In fact, the evolution of the dance form Kathak was the outcome of this cultural synthesis.

Even though the Mughal forces suppressed the Sikhs under Banda Bahadur and he was executed, yet the Sikh resistance against Mughal authority continued. In the 1720s and 1730s, Amritsar emerged as a prominent centre of Sikh activity, owing to its pre-eminence as a pilgrimage centre. Kapur Singh, one of the most important of the Sikh leaders of the time, operated from its vicinity. He gradually established a robust revenue and military system. Along with him, some other Sikh groups too started consolidating themselves as a political force. These activities raised the alarm for the Mughal governors of the Lahore *subah*. Abdus Samad Khan, and later his son, Zakariya Khan, attempted to control the sovereign power of Punjab. However, after the latter's demise in c.1745 CE, the balance shifted more further in favour of the Sikh warrior leaders, such as Jassa Singh Ahluwalia, who founded the kingdom of Kapurthala. In eastern Punjab and Bari Doab, during the next two decades, there was a mushrooming of different pockets under the authority of Sikh leaders preceding Ahmed Shah Abdali's invasion of the Punjab and they offered principal opposition to Abdali in his campaigns of the 1750s and 1760s. Eventually, by the mid-1760s, Sikh authority over Lahore was well-established, while the Afghans failed to consolidate their early gains. Under Ahmad Shah's successor, Timur Shah (c.1772–93 CE), some of the territories and towns that had been taken by the Sikhs (such as Multan) were recovered, and the descendants of Ahmad Shah continued to harbour ambitions for controlling the region. By 1770s, they had to deal with a confederation of about 60 Sikh chieftains, some of who later emerged as princely states under the British, such as Nabha and Patiala.

The Sikh chiefdoms continued many of the Mughals administrative practices and the Persianised culture of the Mughal bureaucracy continued for a long time. The premier subordinates of the chiefs were given *jagir* assignments. It was one such chief, Ranjit Singh, grandson of Charhat Singh Sukerchakia, who eventually welded these principalities into a larger entity, though it lasted for a brief time. Ranjit Singh's kingdom represented the culmination of nearly a century of Sikh rebellions against Mughal rule. His rise to power was based on superior military force, partly serviced by European mercenaries and by the strategic location of his territories. He applied the principles of statecraft intelligently. He captured Lahore in c.1799 CE and used the great trading city to his economic advantage. He controlled the different trade routes, and in order to enhance his revenues he imposed monopolies on the trade in salt, grain, and textiles from Kashmir. Using these earnings, he built up a huge modernised army of 40,000 cavalry and infantry. By c.1809 CE he was the undisputed master of the most of Punjab. His effective rule lasted four decades, from c.1799 to 1839 CE. However, within 10 years of his death, the British annexed Punjab.

# RAJPUTS

As we have discussed earlier, Rajputs had proved to be a great support to the Mughals, specially in controlling the peripheral areas. However, during the reign of Aurangzeb, the Mughal relations with Rajputs suffered, particularly over the issue of the Aurangzeb's interference in the succession dispute of Marwar. His support to the rival candidate antagonised the Rajputs and his occupation of Jodhpur further put a dent on the Mughal– Rajput relations, alienating the Rajputs totally from the Mughal rule. Most of the larger Rajput states were constantly involved in petty quarrels and civil wars. In fact, Ajit Singh of Marwar was killed by his own son.

One of the principalities that came into prominence in the early 18th century was that of Jaipur (earlier Amber), located in eastern Rajasthan. Its ruler, Sawai Jai Singh (after whom Jaipur came to be named), in

order to increase his power, took various steps such as arranging to have his *jagir* assignment in the vicinity of his home territories and taking on rights of land revenue through farming, which were gradually made permanent. By the time of his death in c.1743 CE, he clearly emerged as the single most important ruler in the region. But due to the series of crop failures in the 1750s and 60s, the already fragile agriculture of the region was adversely affected. The second half of the 18th century was thus marked by an economic depression, accompanied by a decline in the political power of Jaipur, and it became a vulnerable target for the ambitions of the Marathas, and of Mahadaji Scindia in particular.

# SOUTH INDIA

In the south, several states did make a determined effort during this period to consolidate their power by the use of access to sea and ports. Principal among these were Travancore in Kerala under Martanda Varma and Rama Varma, and Mysore under Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan. These states rose to prominence only in the latter half of the 18th century, or at least after c.1740 CE. There were three formidable powers in the south: the Marathas who were present both at Thanjavur and elsewhere, Sadullah Khan of Arcot (or Karnataka) who had ruled the Arcot principality around the 1700s, and the Nizam-ul- Mulk of Hyderabad who had consolidated his position at Hyderabad by the 1740s. It is pertinent to note that neither of these rulers, while establishing dynastic succession, claimed full sovereignty and continued to present themselves as representatives of Mughal authority.

However, in the second half of the 18th century, the power of all three of these declined. The succession struggle at Arcot in the 1740s and early 1750s emptied the state coffers and its rulers succumbed to financial manipulation by private British merchants, to whom they were increasingly in debt for war expenses. Similarly, in the c.1750s after the death of its founder, Nizam-ul-Mulk, the power of Hyderabad also declined. The control of the coastal districts was quickly lost, leaving the kingdom landlocked and relatively sparsely populated. This again

resulted in economic loss as the flourishing trade was lost due to this and the state was not able to maintain its affairs independently.

## **The State of Travancore**

Martanda Varma, ruled Travancore (southern Kerala state of Venad) from c.1729 to 1758 CE, initiated many measures to strengthen his authority, such as building a substantial standing army, reducing the power of the Nayar aristocracy upon which rulers of the area had earlier depended militarily, and fortifying the northern limits of his kingdom at the so-called "Travancore line." In order to limit European involvement in trade, he extended patronage to the Syrian Christians, a large trading community within his domains. In order to further keep the trade under his watch, he declared many goods as royal monopoly items, requiring a license for trade, such as pepper. These policies were also continued religiously by Martanda's successor, Rama Varma (c.1758–98 CE), who was able to defend his kingdom successfully against a new rival power —Mysore.

## **The Rise of Mysore**

Under the rulers of the Vadiyar (or Wodeyar) dynasty, such as Kanthirava Narasaraja and Chikka Devaraja, Mysore emerged as an important state. Mysore being a landlocked kingdom was dependent on trade and military supplies brought through the ports of the Indian east coast. As these ports came increasingly under European control, Mysore's vulnerability increased. In c.1761 CE, a cavalry commander of migrant origin, Haidar Ali, assumed effective power in the kingdom reducing the Vadiyars to figureheads and displacing the powerful Kalale family of ministers. Haidar, and later around c.1782 CE, his son, Tipu Sultan, made attempts to consolidate Mysore and make it a kingdom with access to not one but both coasts of peninsular India. In fact, they were relatively successful too against the Kodavas (the inhabitants of the upland kingdom of Kodagu, Coorg), Coastal Karnataka, and northern Kerala, enabling Tipu to open diplomatic and commercial relations on his own with the Middle East. However, both Haidar and Tipu were always resisted by the *Poligars*, the local chiefs, and they also faced a formidable military adversary in the form of the English East India Company.
