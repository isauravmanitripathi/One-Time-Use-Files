# THE VEDIC AGE (RIG VEDIC AND LATER VEDIC ) (c. 1500–500 BCE)

Harappan culture was followed by another great civilisation and culture known as Vedic culture. It is called Vedic Age as its reconstruction is primarily based on using Vedic texts as sources. However, archaeological sources have also supplemented the texts, though not comprehensively. Indo-Aryans are believed to be the composers of Vedic texts. The term 'Indo-Aryans' is basically a linguistic term and refers to speakers of a sub group of the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European family of languages. *Rig Veda* composers describe themselves as *Arya* (a cultural/ethnic term etymologically derived from '*ar*' meaning to cultivate, literally meaning kinsmen or companion, in Sanskrit it means favourably disposed new comers and later it implied men of good family 'noble'). There is still no consensus on the original home of Aryans and different theories are postulated which further continue the debate. The different theories are as follows:

| Theory   | Postulates                                                    | Supported<br>by    |

The dominant and mostly accepted view is that instead of an Aryan invasion, there was a series of Indo-Aryan Immigrations and they came to the sub-continent as immigrants. The archaeological evidence of the migrations comes from what is known as Andronovo culture situated in Southern Siberia. This culture flourished in the second millennium BCE. From here, people moved to the north of Hindukush (the area known as Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex) and from here they entered India. Evidences of horses, spoked wheels, fire cults, and cremation (which formed important parts of Aryan life in India) during the period between 1900 BCE and 1500 BCE, were found in these regions. Apart from these, the artifacts and ceramics also suggest movement of people from Central Asian region to South Asian region.

The earliest Aryans lived in the land of the (**Sapta Sindhu**) (Sindhu is the river par excellence of the Aryans) and probably because of their use of horse chariots and superior military technology, they could establish their political dominance in the region. The region was drained by the seven rivers, *viz*., the Indus (*Sindhu*), and its five tributaries, namely, the **Jhelum** (*Vatista*), **Beas** (*Vipasa*), **Chenab** (*Askini*), **Ravi** (*Purushni*), **Sutlej** (*Sutudri*), and the **Saraswati** (**modern Ghaggar Hakra**), which covered mostly the areas of eastern Afghanistan, Punjab, and fringes of western U.P. The rare mention of the river Yamuna (twice) and Ganga (only once) is pointer to the fact that Rig Vedic Aryans had not inhabited that region as yet.

RIG VEDIC CULTURE (C. 1500–1000 BCE) / EARLY

# VEDIC CIVILISATION

The Vedic corpus is generally divided into Early Vedic and Later Vedic texts. However, recently, on the basis of internal chronology, more complex classification has been adopted, which divides the Vedic literature as:

- a. Early Vedic Literature/Rig Vedic Culture (c. 1500–1000 BCE): Includes the Rig Veda Samhita and other texts of the family. They are called 'family books' as their composition is attributed to the families of certain seer poets, such as Vishvamitra, Atri, Gritsamada, Vasishtha, and Bharadvaja.
- b. Later Vedic Literature/Later Vedic Culture (c. 1000–500 BCE): Includes Books 1, 8, 9, and 10 of the *Rig Veda Samhita*, the Samhitas of the *Sama Veda*, the *Yajur* and the *Atharva Vedas* and the *Brahmanas*, *Aranyakas*, and *Upanishads* attached to all the four Vedas.

The word *Veda* has been derived from the root '*vid'*, which means to know/knowledge. They hold the status of *Shruti* (which has been heard) and have been transmitted orally for many centuries. Later, they were written down, and the earliest surviving manuscript belongs to the 11th century. There are four Vedas and every Veda generally has four parts: *Samhita*, *Brahmana*, *Aranyaka*, and *Upanishad*. The four Vedas are:

![](_page_6_Picture_0.jpeg)

**The Vedas**

- Rig Veda
- Sama Veda
- Yajur Veda
- Atharva Veda

![](_page_6_Picture_6.jpeg)

#### **Rig Veda**

The Rig Veda is a collection of 1,028 hymns, divided into 10 *Mandals* (books). They are the earliest compositions and hence, they depict the life of the Early Vedic people in India. Recently, the Rig Veda has been included by the UNESCO in the list of literature signifying World Human Heritage.

- Earliest Mandals, i.e., II to VII are called family books as they are ascribed to particular families of seers/*rishis*.
- Mandal VIII – Mostly relate to Kanva's family.
- Mandal IX – Compilation of Soma hymns.
- Mandal I and X – Are later additions and contains the

*Purusashukta* which explains the four *varnas*.

- The priests related to the Rig Veda are *Kotri* or *Motri*, and the *Upveda* of the Rig Veda is the Ayurveda.
- Only surviving recension of the Rig Veda is the *Shakala shakha*.

#### **Sama Veda**

The *Sama Veda* is the collection of verses mostly taken from the *Rig Veda*, but arranged in a poetic form to facilitate singing. It is a collection of 1,810 melodies, and also contains the famous Dhrupada raga, later sung by Tansen. The *Upveda* of the *Sama Veda* is the (Gandharva Veda). Recensions (*Shakhas*) of the Sama Veda are *Kauthuma*, *Jaiminiya* (*Talavakara*), and *Ranayaniya*.

#### **Yajur Veda**

The Yajur Veda deals with the procedure for the performance of sacrifices. The texts are further divided into:

- a. *Shukla* Yajur Veda/White Yajur Veda/*Vajasaneya* (contains only the *Mantras*) It contains the *Madhyandina* and *Kanva* recensions.
- b. *Krishna* Yajur Veda/Black Yajur Veda (contains both *mantras* and prose explanations/ commentary).

It contains the *Kathaka, Maitrayani, Taittiriya*, and *Kapishthala* recensions. The *Upveda* of the Yajur Veda is the Dhanur Veda.

#### **Atharva Veda**

The Atharva Veda is a collection of magic spells and charms to ward off the evil spirits and diseases.

It is the last Veda and is considered a non-Aryan work divided into 20 *kandas* (books), with 711 hymns. It contains the Gopatha Brahmana. The *Shaunaka* and *Paippalada* are the recensions of the Atharva Veda. The *Upveda* of the Atharva Veda is the Shilpa Veda.

#### **Brahmanas**

The Brahmanas describe the rules for the performance of sacrificial ceremonies. They, however, explain the hymns of the Vedas in an orthodox manner. Each Veda has several Brahmanas attached to it. The most important Brahmana is the *Satpatha Brahmana*, which is attached to the Yajur Veda and is the most exhaustive. It recommends 'one hundred sacred paths'.

#### **Aranyakas**

They are called the 'forest books' as they were written mainly by hermits living in the jungles for their pupils. They deal with mysticism and philosophy and oppose sacrifice. They emphasise meditation and are considered to be the concluding portion of the Brahmanas, and interpret rituals in a philosophical way.

#### **Upanishads**

The literal meaning of 'Upanishad' is 'to sit near someone'. There are 108 Upanishads, of which 13 are the most prominent. The Upanishads dwell on the '**Atman'** and '**Brahman'**, and focus a lot on the philosophy about life, universe, self, body, sacrifice, etc. They emphasise that the knowledge of the self or *atman* should be acquired and that the relation of the *atman* with the *Brahman* should be properly understood.

- The Mandukyopanishad "*Satyamev jayate* " is the largest of all Upanishads.
- The Chhandogya Upanishad – Clearly refers to the first three *ashrams* and discusses the types of marriage (mainly two).
  - *Anuloma* marriage – The marriage of a man in his own *varna* or below his *varna*. It is the most accepted and common form of marriage in the society.
  - *Pratiloma* marriage – The marriage of a girl/woman in a *varna* lower than her own, deemed rare and not sanctioned by the Vedas.

![](_page_9_Picture_0.jpeg)

#### **Vedanta**

*Vedanta* literally signifies the *'*end of the Vedas', as they reveal the final aim of the Vedas. They condemn sacrifices and ceremonies and denote the last phase of the Vedic period.

#### **Vedanga**

The word '*Vedanga*' means the 'limbs of the Vedas'. They are the supplementary texts that aid in the proper recitation and understanding of the Vedas. However, these do not qualify as *Shruti* as they are considered of human origin (not revealed by the gods) and are written in the form of *Sutras*. *Sutras* are very short condensed statements that are used to express varied ideas. There are six *Sutras*. They are:

- 1. *Shiksha* (Phonetics)
- 2. *Kalpa* (Ritualistic science).
- 3. *Jyotisha* (Astronomy)
- 4. *Vyakaran* (Grammar)
- 5. *Nirukta* (Etymology)
- 6. *Chhanda* (Metrics)

The *Kalpasutra* is further divided into:

- a. *Shrautasutra*: concerned with Vedic sacrifices that require three or more fires.
- b. *Grihyasutra*: concerned with comparatively simpler domestic sacrifices, which require only one fire. It includes rituals pertaining to crucial life stages (*Samskaras*) such as *Upanayana* (initiation), *Vivaha* (marriage), and *Antyeshti* (funerary practices).
- c. *Dharmasutra*: concerned with the rituals' Dharma.

#### **Puranas**

The word 'puranas' literally means 'old'. They *w*ere the religious sectarian literature of later times (around 4th 6th centuries), but have a well-defined perception of the past traditions. They reflect the Brahmanical social and religious values and also shed light on the emergence and development of Hindu religious practices. The Puranas generally discuss five topics in the time span of four ages/*yugas* (*Satya*, *Treta*, *Dvapara*, *and Kali*):

- 1. *Sarga* (Deals with the creation of the world)
- 2. *Pratisarga* (Recreation)
- 3. *Manvantaras* (Periods of the various Manus)
- 4. *Vamsha* (Genealogies of the gods and *rishis*)
- 5. *Vamshanucharita* (Texts relating to royal dynasties, both the Suryavanshis—who claimed their descent from the Sun—and Chandravanshis—who claimed their descent from the Moon).
- Traditionally, the Puranas are considered to be composed by Vyasa and it is commonly accepted that the four *yugas* make up a *mahayuga*, that 1000 *mahayugas* make a *kalpa*, that and every *kalpa* is further divided into 14 *manvantaras* which are presided over by a specific Manu. Each *Yuga* is periodically destroyed and again, the recreation of world occurs with the cyclical decline and revival of Dharma.
- The Puranas are further divided into 18 *Mahapuranas* (great *Puranas* such as *Brahma*, *Vishnu*, *Narada*, *Bhagavata*, *Padma*, *Garuda*, *Varaha*, *Matsya*, *Kurma*, *Linga*, *Shiva*, *Skanda*, *Agni*,

*Vamana*, etc.) and numerous *Upapuranas* (secondary Puranas).

• Some *Puranas* such as the *Brahma, Matsya, Harivamsha, Vishnu, Brahmanda*, and *Vayu* provide useful information on historical dynasties (of Haryankas, Shishunagas, Nandas, Mauryas, Shungas — till the Guptas). They also contain detailed accounts of historical geography such as mountains, rivers, etc.

#### **Dharamshastra**

They are the Sanskrit texts dealing specifically with Dharma (code of conduct that conceptually signifies 'a righteous moral law' which is in consonance with the universal natural law). Dharma also refers to the fulfillment of *Purusharthas* (life goals) such as Dharma (righteous conduct), Artha (material well-being), Kama (sensual pleasure), and Moksha (liberation from the cycle of life and death). The *Dharmashastras* are further subdivided into *Dharmasutras* (composed during c.600 300 BCE) and *Smritis* (composed during c.200 BCE 900 CE). They recognise three sources of Dharma, namely, the Vedas (*Shruti*)*, Smriti* (that which is remembered) texts, and *Shistachara* (good mannerisms and practices of decent cultured people). A person's Dharma was dependent on many factors such as gender, marital status, *varna,* and *ashram*. Out of the four *varnas*, three *varnas*, i.e., *Brahmanas*, *Kshatriyas*, and *Vaishyas* were considered *Dvija* (twice born, as they had the right to the sacred thread ceremony considered akin to second birth), while the *Shudras* were burdened with many civil disabilities.

The four ashrams dividing the life of a *dvija* male were:

- a. *Brahmacharya* (Celibate studenthood)
- b. *Grihastha* (Household caretaker)
- c. *Vanaprastha* (Partial renunciation)
- d. *Sanyasa* (Complete renunciation)

It should be noted that the different *ashram* stages were not followed rhetorically by all and it was not even applicable to women or *shudras*.

#### **Epics**

The two Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, are part of both oral and written traditional history .The link between the *Puranas* and the epics is that the heroes and clans who are the actors in the epics are the descendants of Manu's progeny. The two epics were clearly aware of each other as the Mahabharata has a section called *Ramopakhyana*, detailing the story of Rama, and the Ramayana mentions the *Kurus* and, Hastinapur but does not mention the Mahabharata war.

### **Social life of Rig Vedic Aryans**

Rig Vedic society was a tribal society and its people lived a seminomadic life. Aryan tribes were called *Jana*s. Their chief (*rajan*) was known as the *Gopati* or *Gopa* (protector of cows), and the chief queen was called the *Mahisi*. The *Janas* often had conflicts with the Panis, who used to hide the cattle of Aryans in the forest and were thus deemed the enemies of Aryans. In order to get their cattle back, the Vedic God 'Indra' was invoked and many battles known as *Gavisthi*, *Gaveshana*, *Goshu*, or *Gavyat* (to search for cows) were fought between the Aryans and the Panis.

The society's political structure was somewhat similar to the monarchial form, but the *Gopati*'s office was not hereditary and he was selected among the clan's men. The society was not divided on caste lines and even the *Rajans*, the *Purohits*, the artisans, etc., were part of the clan networks. Occupation was not based on birth. Members of a family could adopt different occupations. This is indicated by the following verse in the Rigveda: *"I am a poet, my father is a physician, and my*

*mother grinds grain upon the stone. Striving for wealth, with varied plans, we follow our desires like cattle."*

However, certain differences did exist during the period. *Varna* or colour was the basis of initial differentiation between the Vedic and non-Vedic people. The Vedic people were fair whereas the non-Vedic indigenous people were dark in complexion and spoke a different language. Authors of Rig Veda distinguished themselves from other groups whom they called "*dasyus*" or " *dasas*". The *dasas* were also referred as *a-vrata* (who do not obey the ordinances of the gods) and *akratu* (those who do not perform sacrifices).

Thus, even though a socially organised "*varna* system" was not prevalent and tribal elements were stronger in the society, yet Rig Vedic society can still not be considered a totally egalitarian society as social stratification was based on the division of labour and gender. The only mention of the four *varnas* was found in the *Purusashukta* of the tenth *mandal* of the Rig Veda, which makes one conclude that the *varna* system was probably introduced at the end of the Rig Vedic age and that there was social mobility and the absence of strict social hierarchy. However, the Rig Vedic people were familiar with slavery.

All the social units were based on brotherhood. *Kula* (Family) was the basic social unit and *Kulapa* was the head of the family. Largely, there were joint families in the Rig Vedic age, which followed the patrilineal system. The family was part of a larger grouping, called *vis* or clan. One or more than one clans made *jana* or tribe. The *jana* was the largest social unit.

In the Rig Veda, no desire is expressed for daughters, though the desire for children and cattle is a recurrent theme in the hymns. The society was patriarchal in nature, though the women had important positions in the society since they were educated and had access to the assembly. They composed hymns and received *Upanayana.* Women attended the meetings of the *Vidatha*. Girls were free to choose their life partners. There are no instances of child marriage, *sati*, or *purdah* in the Rig Veda. There were few instances of levirate (marrying the husband's younger brother on the death of husband) and widow remarriage. Marriage was usually monogamous, though some references to

polygyny and polyandry are also found in the Rig Veda.

There is no mention of any officer for administering justice, but Rig Vedic Society was not an ideal society as there were cases of theft and burglary. Military technique was much advanced as they possessed chariots driven by horses. The Aryans were engaged in two types of battles:

- 1. With pre-Aryans (probably referred to them as *Dasas/Dasyus*.)
- 2. Amongst themselves: There have been mentions of two such battles
  - a. A battle occurred between a Bharata King Divodasa (winner), and *Dasa* ruler Shambara.
  - b. The 'battle of ten kings'(*dasharajna*): This was fought between the Bharata chief Sudas, grandson of Divodasa (winner) on one side, and ten other tribes including the famous five tribes (*Panch-jana*), namely, the Yadu, Turvasha, Puru, Anu, and Druhyu. Later, the Bharatas joined hands with the Purus to form the Kuru tribe.

Some of the important functionaries of Rig Vedic Societies were –

- *Purohit* (priest)
- *Senani* (leader of an army)
- *Gramini* (leader of a village)

Some important tribal assemblies of this period were:

## **Rig Vedic Economy**

Since the Rig Vedic society was a pastoral society, cattle rearing was their dominant activity. The chief measure of wealth was cattle and a wealthy man was known as *Gomat*, that is to say, one who owned many cattle. A large number of words are derived from the word '*gau*', meaning cow.

Evidence of trade and commerce is meagre, and there was no concept of private property based on land ownership. The clan as a whole enjoyed rights over the resources. The unit of currency was *niskha*, which was made of gold. Barter was the model of exchange and the cow was an important unit of value. There was no regular revenue system and the kingdom was maintained by the voluntary tribute (*bali*) of subjects and bounty won in a battle.

Gift exchange and redistribution had an important economic role in the Rig Vedic society. Such exchanges, known as 'prestations', were done not on an individual level but at the group level. Apart from economic goods, this also included the exchange of other things such as women, courtesies, hospitality, and military assistance. The priests received *dana* (gifts) and *dakshina* (sacrificial offering) for their ritualistic services. Shifting agriculture was practiced and fire was used to burn down forest cover and the patch of land thus cleared was then sown. Apart from *yava* or barley, no other grain is mentioned. The Rig Vedic people used wooden plough (*phala*, *langala*, and '*sira'*). Vedic god Indra is also described as Urvarajit (winner of fertile fields), and there are also references to Kshetrapati (guardian deity of agricultural fields). They did not use iron technology, but were familiar with copper. Also, there have been very less references to metallurgical activities. A lot of other crafts such as cart-making, carpentry, tanning, sewing, and weaving, find mention, though the chariot-maker enjoyed a special status in Rig Vedic society. Chariot-racing and dice gambling were popular pastimes.

## **Rig Vedic Religion**

There was neither temple nor idol worship in the Early Vedic age. The Rig Veda reflects naturalistic polytheism (similar to primitive animism) as they venerated natural forces like the wind, rain, water, thunder, etc. Very few temple divinities were venerated. They generally worshipped in the open air through *yajnas*. Vedic texts refer to meat eating and also the sacrificial killing of animals except the cow, which was considered *aghnya* (not to be killed). A peculiar case of Henotheism or

Kathenotheism is found in Rig Vedic religion, wherein the deity being invoked in a particular hymn is considered the supreme god. Some of the deities worshipped by the Rig Vedic People were as follows:

#### **Indra**

- Greatest god of the Aryans
- 250 hymns are attributed to him
- Called Purandhar (Breaker of forts), Maghavan (bounteous), and Vritrahan (Slayer of Vritra, chaos)

#### **Agni**

- Second most important god; the god of fire
- 200 hymns are attributed to him
- The son of earth and heaven
- Intermediary between gods and men

#### **Varuna**

- Third most important god; the god of personified water
- Looked after *rita* or the cosmic order
- Ethically, the highest at all Rig Vedic Gods.

#### **Soma**

- *God of plants*/king of gods/special god of the Brahmanas
- All hymns of the 11 *mandal* assigned to him
- Aryans knew Himalaya (*Munjavat*) as the source of the *soma* plant
- Considered the wise god who inspires the poets to compose hymns

#### **Yama**

• Lord of death

#### **Rudra**

- Amoral archer god whose arrows brought diseases
- Lived in the mountains, and the guardian of healing herbs
- Resembled Greek God Apollo and identified as Protosiva

#### **Pushan**

- The god of jungle paths, herdsmen, and cattle
- Aided the transformation of day to night and vice versa

**Surya** – Son of Dyaus, who drives away darkness and spreads light

**Savitri** – Solar deity to whom the famous *Gayatri Mantra* is attributed to in the third *mandal*

of the Rig Veda

**Aditi** – Goddess of eternity and the mother of the gods, invoked to bestow freedom from evil, harm, and sickness

**Prithvi** – Earth goddess

**Vishnu** – Benevolent god, but mentioned very infrequently in the Rig Veda

**Marutas** – The son's of Rudra, who personified storms

**Vayu** – God of wind

**Ashvins** – The twin Gods of war and fertility

**Usha** – Goddess of dawn, and is mentioned around 300 times in the Rig Veda hymns

**Sinivali** – Bestows children

#### **Demi-gods**:

- 1. Gandharvas (Divine musicians)
- 2. Apasaras (Mistress of Gods)
- 3. Vishwadevas (Intermediate deities)
- 4. Aryaman (Guardian of compacts and marriages)

# LATER VEDIC CULTURE AND CIVILISATION (C. 1000- 500 BCE)

The Later Vedic Age is characterised by more complexities in social, political, and economic life. In terms of the political context, the tiny tribal settlements of the Vedic period were replaced by comparatively stronger kingdoms, while royal power increased. The core geographical area of the Rig Vedic texts corresponds to Eastern Afghanistan, Punjab, and western U.P., whereas the core geographical area of Later Vedic texts corresponds to the Kuru–Panchala Region, which comprised the Indo-Gangetic divide and the upper Ganga Valley.

The term '*Rashtra*' first appeared in this period. The wars were no longer fought for cows, but for territories. The predominantly pastoral society of Early Vedic times had become agricultural. Chiefs grew at the expense of the tribal peasantry and handsomely rewarded the priests who helped them in maintaining their authority. It should be noted that even in Later Vedic times, the king did not possess a standing army and tribal units were mustered in times of war. Traces of election of the chief or king appear in late Vedic texts, but hereditary kingship was emerging. The king's influence was further strengthened by ritual enactments such as the *Rajasuya* (which was royal consecration and conferred supreme power on the king), *Vajapeya* (literally meaning

drink of strength; it had a chariot race in which royal chariot was made to win against all kinsmen), and *Aswamedha* (unquestioned control over an area in which the royal horse ran uninterrupted). It was slowly turning in its later stages to an a*ge of the 'janapadas'* instead of *'janas'.* The king was usually a *kshatriya* and the office of the monarch was made almost hereditary. The king was addressed by different names across different regions.

### **Later Vedic Society**

One of the most important changes from the Rig Vedic society was the rise and growth of social differentiation in the form of the *varna* system. The Later Vedic society was clearly divided into four *varnas*: Brahmanas, Rajanyas or Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras. Another important institution that began to take shape was *ashrama* or the different stages of life. Together with *varna*, Later Vedic society came to be known as *Varna-ashrama-dharma* society. The upper three classes known as *Dvija* (twice born) discriminated against both *Shudras* and *Chandalas*. Caste exogamy was extensively practiced and a rigid social hierarchy developed, which restricted the social mobility of the earlier period. The increasing cult of sacrifices added enormously to the power of the Brahmanas. Education was largely confined to *dvija* castes and began with the investiture ceremony (*Upanayana*), although women

were also initiated at times. Assemblies were then dominated by nobles and affluent men and women were no longer permitted to attend assemblies. *Sabha* and *Samities* continued to hold ground, though not like the Rig Vedic Age, but the *vidatha* completely disappeared.

**Later Vedic Caste Image**

The Later Vedic family became large enough to be called a joint family, with three or four generations living together. The rows of hearths discovered at Atranjikhera and at Ahichchhtra (both in western Uttar Pradesh) show that these were meant for communal feeding or for cooking the food of large families. In the family, a patrimonial (authority of father) system developed and women were generally confined to household chores and subordinate positions. As compared to the Rig Vedic age, women lost importance in the society and there have been references to rare instances of *sati* and child marriage. In one text, women have been counted as a vice along with dice and wine. In another text, a daughter has been said to be the source of all sorrows.

The institution of *gotra* appeared in the Later Vedic culture. Literally it

means 'cow pen' or the place where cattle belonging to whole clan are kept, but in course of time it meant descent from a common ancestor. Marriage between persons of the same *gotra* was forbidden. There were legendary seers, such as, Kashyapa, Vashista, Bhrigu, Gautama, Bhardwaj, Attri, Vishwamitra, and Agastya, after whom the *gotras* were named. Kshatriyas and Vaishyas took the same *gotra* names of the families of Brahmans who traditionally performed their domestic rituals. There is mention of the *Chandrayana* Penance for men marrying women of the same *gotra*. *Ashrama* or the four stages of life were prescribed, but were not religiously followed.

The Later Vedic culture is also called as PGW–Iron Phase culture, as a particular kind of pottery (painted grey ware) was used during that phase. The main factor in the expansion of the Aryan culture during the Later Vedic period was the beginning of the use of iron, which was introduced around 1000 BCE and is mentioned as *Krishna Ayas*/*Shyama Ayas.* The Rig Vedic people knew of a metal, called *ayas*, which was either copper or bronze.

**Painted Grey Ware**

The society was largely rural. However, towards the end of the period, there are traces of the beginning of urbanism (as *nagar* in the sense of a town is mentioned in the *Taittiriya Aranyaka*). Agriculture emerged as the chief means of livelihood of the Later Vedic people. The forests were cleared by burning the trees, which is also mentioned in the *Satapatha Brahamana* (ruler Videha Madhava burned the forests between river Saraswati to river Sedanira or Gandak). Cultivation was done by the plough. Mixed farming (cultivation along with herding) was one of the prime occupations of the Later Vedic people. The land

was still communally owned over which the '*vish*' (clan) had many participatory rights, but it was recognised as property and the head of the household who owned the land was termed as '*Grahpati*'. Rice *(Vrihi)* and wheat *(Godhuma)* became the staple diet of the people and lentils were also grown. Also, with the beginning of food production, agricultural produce began to be offered in the rituals. The items of *dana* and *dakshina* included cooked rice. *Tila*, from which the first widely used vegetable food-oil was derived increasingly, came to be used in rituals.

Diverse arts and crafts were practiced in the Later Vedic period. Tin, lead, silver, Iron, gold, bronze, and copper were known to Later Vedic people. There were probably good smiths and smelters as a lot of copper objects have been found at PGW Sites. People had obtained knowledge of glass manufacturing too. *Shresthins* indicate the guilds or organisation of merchants. Exchange was still via barter, but *Niskha* was used as a convenient unit of value although not as a typical currency. Wagons drawn by oxen were probably the most used mode of transport.

The Later Vedic people were acquainted with four types of pottery:

- a. Painted Grey Ware
- b. Black and Red Ware
- c. Black-slipped Ware
- d. Red Ware

Unlike the Rig Vedic age where only voluntary offerings were taken and per se no revenue collection was done, in the Later Vedic age, collection of taxes and tributes was made mandatory and were done by *Sangrihitri*. It is equally interesting to note that the Vaishyas appear to be the only tribute payers in Later Vedic times.

## **Later Vedic Age Religion**

The Later Vedic culture was focused on the centrality of the cult of sacrifice. Sacrifice became more important and elaborate, and assumed both public and domestic character. There was an increase in the frequency and number of the *yajnas*, which generally involved the killing of animals on a large scale and the destruction of cattle wealth.

This was probably the result of the growing importance of a class of Brahmanas and their efforts to maintain their supremacy in the changing society. These *yajnas* brought to them a large amount of wealth in the form of *dana* and *dakshina*. Some of the important *yajnas* were − *Ashvamedha*, Vajapeya, Rajasuya, etc. The purpose of these *yajnas* was two-fold. Firstly, it established the authority of the chiefs over the people, and secondly, it reinforced the territorial aspect of the polity since people from all over the kingdom were invited to these sacrifices.

Changes in the material life naturally resulted in a change in their attitude towards gods and goddesses as well. The two most important Rig Vedic Gods, Indra and Agni, lost their importance and instead of them, Prajapati (the creator) became supreme. Some of the other minor gods became prominent, such as **Vishnu** (conceived as the preserver and protector of people) and **Rudra** (the god of animals). Idolatry appears in late Vedic phase and just as the society was divided in the later Vedic phase in terms of social classes, similarly some of the social orders too adopted their own deities. For example, **Pushan** (who was supposed to look after cattle) came to be regarded as the god of the Shudras.

However, towards the end of Later Vedic age, a strong reaction began to emerge against priestly domination, against cults and sacrifices, especially in the land of Panchala and Videha where, around 600 BCE, the Upanishads were compiled.
