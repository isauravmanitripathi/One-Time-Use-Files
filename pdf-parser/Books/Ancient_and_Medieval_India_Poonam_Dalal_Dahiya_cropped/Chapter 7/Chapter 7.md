## POLITICAL AND CULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS DURING c. 200 BCE–300 CE

The period between c.200 BCE-300 CE did not witness the emergence of a large empire like that of the Mauryas, but it is a period notable for many other historical, political, and cultural achievements. This period is marked by a shift in political focus from Magadha to north-western India. It saw a series of invasions and the rise of many regional kingdoms, as well as the emergence of new traditions of governance such as joint rule and subordinate rule. This is also a period where cities expanded, and urban culture gained a certain predominance. There was an increase in specialised crafts and a marked expansion of trade networks. The economy saw an increasing use of currency. This was, furthermore, a period defined by the intermingling and influence of new cultures, vibrant doctrinal debates, the rise in devotional worship of images and the institutionalisation of religious activity. The period also saw the emergence of sophisticated sculptural and architectural styles. The period, in short, contributed much to the rich and versatile heritage of the sub-continent as we know it today.

## POLITICAL HISTORY OF NORTH INDIA

As we have discussed earlier, the last Maurya king Brihadartha was murdered in 187 BCE by his own commander-in-chief, Pushyamitra Sunga, while he was inspecting his troops. The Maurya rule thus came to an end and the Sunga Dynasty was established as the rulers of Magadha. It is pertinent to note that Pushyamitra's empire extended over only part of the erstwhile Maurya empire, including Pataliputra, Ayodhya, Vidisha, and some parts of modern day Punjab (like Jalandhar and *Sakala*, or Sialkot as it is known now). The Sungas are considered *Brahmanas* in their caste origins, and they are referred to in both Buddhist and Brahminical texts such as the *Harshacharita*, the

*Brihadaranyaka Upanishad*, Panini's *Ashtadhyayi*, Kalidasa's *Malavikaagnimitram*, *Divyavadana* and Tarantha's (a Buddhist scholar) account. The ten Sunga kings ruled, in all likelihood, for a total of 112 years.

#### **Sunga Dynasty (185 BCE−148 BCE)**

Brihadratha (last Mauryan ruler)

Pushyamitra Sunga (killed Brihadratha, founder of the Sunga Dynasty)

- Formerly the commander-in-chief of the Mauryan Army.
- He performed two Ashvamedha sacrifices, as mentioned in the Ayodhya stone inscription of King Dhana.
- His dominions extended as far as the Narmada river to the south, and included cities such as Pataliputra, Ayodhya, and Vidisha. The drama *Malavikaagnimitram* mentions the conflict between Pushyamitra and Yajnasena, the king of Vidarbha (eastern Maharashtra), and the victory of the Sungas over them.
- He defeated the Bactrian Greek king, Demetrius. This encounter is mentioned in Patanjali's works (who refers to the *yavanas*, that is, foreigners from west coming up to Ayodhya and Chittor) as well as in Kaildasa's *Malavikaagnimitram* (which narrates the incident of the challenging of Pushyamitra's Ashvamedha horse by the *yavanas*, which led to a military encounter between prince Vasumitra, the son of Agnimitra, and the *yavana* army).
- Patanjali, the notable grammarian who wrote the *Mahabhasya* was a contemporary of Pushyamitra Sunga.
- The Divyavadana gives an account of Pushyamitra's cruelty towards Buddhists and his hatred towards Buddhism.

#### **Agnimitra**

– The hero of Kalidasa's *Malavikagnimitram*, described in this drama as the viceroy of Vidisha.

#### **Bhagabhadra**/**Bhagavata**

– Probably the fifth king Kasiputa Bhagabhadra, or the ninth king Bhagavata, as indicated by the notable Besnagar Pillar inscription of Heliodorus. Heliodorus was the Greek Ambassdor of the Indo-Greek ruler Amtalakita/Antialkidas of Taxila, who probably stayed at Sunga's court. In this inscription *he describes himself as a Bhagavata, that is, a worshipper of Lord Krishna and Garuda (Vishnu's vehicle), and declares that he had set up this pillar in honour of this god*.

**Heliodorus Pillar at Vidisha**

#### **Devabhuti**

- Also known as Devabhumi and was the last ruler of the Sunga Dynasty.
- According to the *Harschcharita*, he was killed by his

*Brahmana* minister Vasudeva Kanva, who founded the Kanva dynasty. In parts of the central India, remnants of the Sunga empire was replaced by the Satavahanas.

#### **Kanva Dynasty Vasudeva**

- Supposed to be a descendent of Rishi Kanva and ruled from Pataliputra.
- We know virtually nothing about the Kanvas except for the rather cursory references to them in later texts.
- Also described as the *Sungabhrityas* (literally meaning 'servants of the Sungas').
- They made way for the Mitras in c. 30 BCE, who were eventually dislodged by the Shakas in Magadha.

According to some scholars, the last Kanva ruler Susharman was overthrown by a successor of Simuka of the Satavahana dynasty. Around the same time, that is, 200 BCE, we witness invasions by various groups of people based in Central Asia and western China. These were *Indo-Greeks*, the *Scythians* or the *Shakas*, the *Parthians* or the *Pahlavas* and the *Kushanas*. These invasions not only changed the political structure of north-west India, but also aided in the transmission and transformation of cultural elements of both India and the central Asian region.

### **Indo–Greeks/ Bactrian Greeks**

After the death of Alexander in 323 BCE, many Greeks came to settle on the north-western borders of India with Bactria (presently northern part of Afghanistan, the area lying to the south of the Oxus river and to the north-west of the Hindu Kush mountains). The rulers of Bactria came to be called the Bactrian Greeks, because of their Hellenistic (Greek) ancestry as they were originally *satraps* (subordinate rulers) of the Seleucid Empire of West Asia. Around the 3rd century BCE, Diodotus I (the governor of Bactria) revolted against the Antiochus, the Seleucid king, and established an independent Bactrian Greek kingdom. Later, around c.145 BCE, on account of growing pressure from the Scythian

tribes, the Bactrian Greeks lost their hold over Bactria, but continued to rule for few decades over the north-western part of the sub-continent. These Bactrian Greeks who ruled over parts of north-west India between the 2nd century BCE and the early 1st century BCE are known as the Indo-Greeks.

As we have discussed in the earlier chapter, with the construction of Chinese Wall, the Scythians were pushed back from the China and they turned their attention towards the neighbouring Greeks and Parthians. Thus, in order to escape the wrath of the nomadic Scythian tribes, the Bactrian Greeks were forced to invade India. Since the successors of Ashoka were too weak to hold ground, a series of invasions on the north-western border of India started. In the beginning of the 2nd century BCE, the Indo-Greeks were the first to invade India. They occupied a large part of north-western India, much larger than that conquered by Alexander, and it is believed that they pushed forward to as far as Ayodhya and Pataliputra. They were the first to issue gold coins and much of their lineage is determined on the basis of excavated coins which include coins of sliver, copper, and nickel as well. It is rather interesting to note that out of the 42 Indo-Greek kings, as many as 34 are known only through their coins. The large number of kings within a short span of time suggests that some of them ruled concurrently, and thus it is probable that two Greek dynasties ruled the north-western India on parallel lines simultaneously.

**Demetrius** (King of Bactria)

- Invaded India around 190 BCE and probably also came into conflict with Pushyamitra Shunga.
- Conquered a considerable part of the Mauryan empire in north-western India and extended Bactrian rule to the south of the Hindu Kush.

**Menander** /**Milinda**/**Minedra** (165 BCE – 145 BCE)

- The most celebrated Indo-Greek ruler who not only stabilised Indo-Greek power, but also extended his empire's frontiers in India.
- His empire extended over parts of both Bactria and northwestern India and appears to have included southern

Afghanisthan and Gandhara, the region west of the River Indus.

- Had his capital at *Sakala* (modern Sialkot, Punjab), and it is believed that he also invaded and conquered the Ganga-Yamuna doab but failed to retain it for long.
- He was converted to Buddhism by Nagasena has been identified with the King Milinda mentioned in the famous Buddhist text *Milindapanho* (*Question of Milinda*), which contains philosophical questions that Milinda asked Nagasena (the Buddhist author of the text). The text claims that impressed by the answers, the king accepted Buddhism as his religion.
- He is also identified with King Minedra mentioned in a fragmented Kharosthi inscription found on a casket at Bajaur (presently in the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan), which refers to the enshrining of relics of the Buddha, probably in a *stupa*, during his reign.

**Hermaius** (Last ruler of this dynasty)

– He was defeated by the Parthians around the last quarter of the 2nd century BCE, which led to the end of Greek rule in Bactria and the area to the south of the Hindu Kush.

![](_page_6_Picture_6.jpeg)

However, it should be noted that Indo-Greek rule continued in northwestern India for some more time. There is mention of Queen Agathokleia (probably one of the queens of Menander I) and her son Strato, whose joint coins have been found. This north-west Gandhara region was also lost to Parthians and Shakas in due course of time. Later, in the late 1st century BCE or the early 1st century CE, the last remaining part of their territory, that is, the area to the east of the Jhelum was also ceded to the Kshatrapa ruler Rajuvula.

#### **Impact of Indo-Greek Rule**

a. The Indo-Greeks were the first rulers in India to issue coins (gold, silver, copper, and nickel) which can be definitely attributed to any dynasty and were also the first to issue gold coins in India (which increased in number under the Kushanas). Interestingly, the coins of the Shakas, Parthians and the Kshatrapas followed the basic features of Indo-Greek coinage, including the bilingual and bi-script legends. Indo-Greek coins were miniatures of aesthetic excellence, of precise economic value and also providing useful information on emerging religious sects and cults (specially *Shaiva* and *Bhagvata* sects) that were prominent in that area. Coinage was also adjusted to region and requirement. For instance:

symbols that were Indian rather than Greek in inspiration.

b. They introduced new features of Hellenistic art and literature such as Gandhara art in the north-west frontier of India, which was not purely Greek, but rather it was the outcome of the intermingling and influence of both Indian and central Asian contacts. A striking instance of this mingling is the Besnagar Pillar inscription of Heliodorus. New terms which had the influence of Greek terminology began to be used in the subcontinent. For instance, the term '*horshastra*' used for astrology in Sanskrit is derived from Greek word 'horoscope'.

**Gandhara Image of Buddha**

- c. The Hellenistic Greeks are also known for their monumental buildings and their small, finely-crafted objects. Excavation of the cities of Ai-Khanoum (located on the confluence of the Oxus and the Kokcha of modern Balkh), Antioch, and Sirkap at Taxila, reveal a great talent of urban planning.
- d. The Indo-Greeks also introduced practice of military governorship (the governors were called strategos/*satraps*).

**Indo Scythian Kingdom**

### **The Shakas/Scythians**

'Shaka' is the Indian term used for the people called the Scythians, who originally belonged to Central Asia. Interestingly, Patanjali in his Mahabhasya refers to the Shakas as 'Anirvasita (pure) Shudras'. The Greeks were followed by the Shakas to India, and they controlled a much larger area as compared to the Greeks. In the late 2nd century BCE, as we have discussed earlier, the decline of the Greek kingdoms

(Seleucid empire) in the north-west coincided with the attack on Bactria by nomadic tribal people from central Asia, that is, the Hsiungnu/Xiongnu, Wu-sun, and Yueh-chis (the tribal stock to which the Kushanas too belonged). It is believed that in the first century BCE, on account of excessive snow and continuous raids by their neighbours, the Hsiang-nu suffered famine. This led to their migration and the displacement of the Yueh-Chis, who were driven from their best lands and had to migrate to distant places. The Yueh-Chis were further split into two branches, the Little Yueh-chis (who settled in northern Tibet) and the Great Yueh-chis who went further west, to the shores of the Aral Sea and the plains of the Syr Darya (Jaxartes), displacing the original inhabitants of that area, that is, the Scythians/the Shakas. The Shakas advanced into Bactria, Parthia, and the Indus plains. There were five branches of the Shakas who finally settled with their seats of power in different parts of India and Afghanistan:

- a. One branch of the Shakas settled in Aghanistan. Prominent rulers of this branch were Vonones and Spalirises.
- b. The second branch settled in Punjab with Taxila as their capital. Maues was a prominent ruler.
- c. The third branch settled in Mathura, where it ruled for about two centuries. Azilises was a prominent ruler.
- d. The fourth branch established its hold over western India where they ruled until 4 century CE. They ruled for the maximum period on account of a flourishing economy based on the sea-borne trade in Gujarat and thus issued a large number of silver coins. One of the prominent ruler was Rudradaman I, belonging to the Shaka Kshatrapas of Western Indian lineage.
- e. The fifth branch of the Shakas established its power in the upper Deccan.

These complicated migrations and movements of people from central Asia had a ripple effect in the polity of the Indian sub-continent.

Hsiung-nu➝Yueh-Chis➝The Great Yueh-chis➝The Shakas➝The Parthians The history of Shaka rule is known largely through inscriptions and coins. On the basis of coins, certain kings who can be

identified are Vonones (the earliest independent Parthian ruler of eastern Iran), Spalirises, Azes I, Azilises, and Azes II. Some coins even suggest the practice of conjoined rule as well. For instance, Spalirises and Azes I were probably co-rulers, as were Azes I and Azilises. Some prominent Shaka kings are:

Maues/Moga/Moa (c. 80 BCE)

- Probably the first Shaka king in India who established power in Gandhara.
- Inscription found at Taxila mentions a Shaka king, Moga, and his *kshatrapa*/*satrap* (governor), Patika. His name also appeared on several copper and silver coins. His coins carried figures of typically Indian deities like *Abhisheka Laxmi*.

#### Azes

- Successfully annexed the territory in northern India of the last of the Indo-Greek king Hippostratos.
- He is also believed to be associated with the Vikram Samvat era of 58 BCE, which is used to mark Azes' accession. This era was earlier reckoned with the victory of an Ujjain king named Vikramaditya over the Shakas. It is believed that Vikramaditya effectively fought against the Shakas when all other Indian rulers surrendered in front of them and from that time onwards, '*Vikramaditya*' became a coveted title just like '*Caesar*' for Romans.

The Shakas and Scytho-Parthians ruled through *kshatrapas* (governors) or *mahakshatrapas* (subordinate rulers), who aided a lot in the expansion of the empire. For instance, during the reign of the Scytho-Parthian ruler Azilises, a *kshatrapa* Rajuvula aided a lot in the eastward expansion of his empire. Later, he took title of *mahakshatrapa* and functioned as an independent ruler of the Mathura region and was succeeded by his son Sodasha to the throne of Mathura. It is pertinent to note that these *kshatrapas* had a more independent status than was normal for an administrative governor, since they not only issued their own inscriptions in whatever era they wished to observe, but were also permitted to mint their own coins. Another official title, *meridarch*, was

used for an officer in charge of a designated area.

### **The Scytho-Parthians/***Shaka-Pahlavas*

In mid 1st century CE, the Shakas' domination in north-west India was followed by that of the Parthians, though in comparison with the Greeks and the Shakas they occupied a very small portion of north-western India. In many ancient Sanskrit texts, they are mentioned together as the *Shaka-Pahlavas*. Interestingly, for some time, both ruled concurrently. Generally, the term *Shaka-Pahlava*/Scytho-Parthians is used for different groups of invaders who came from Parthia into north-west India in the 1st century CE. Originally, the Parthians lived in Iran and invaded India at the beginning of the Christian era. Gondophernes/ Guduvhara (mentioned in an inscription dated 45 CE found at Takht-i-Bahi, recovered from Mardan near Peshawar) was the most famous and important Parthian king and it was during his reign that St. Thomas came to India to propagate Christianity. On his coins, there is also mention of his nephew Abdagases, his governors Sapadana and Satavastra, his military governors Aspavarman and Sasa. In due course of time, the Parthians, like the Shakas, became assimilated into the Indian society and became an integral part of it. The Kushanas ultimately ousted the successors of Gondophernes from north-western India.

### **The Kushanas**

The Kushanas were also referred as *Yueh–Chis* (Moon tribe) or *Tocharians*, who were one of the five clans (Kuei-shang) into which the *Yue-chi* tribe was divided. They were nomadic tribal people who were originally from the steppes of north Central Asia. The Kushanas first occupied Bactria (or north Afghanistan), where they displaced the Shakas, and gradually seized Gandhara, replacing the rule of the Greeks and the Parthians in these areas. Ultimately, they set up their authority over the lower Indus basin and the greater part of the Gangetic basin. Their empire extended from the river Oxus to the river Ganga, from

Khorasan in Central Asia to Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh (almost the area of nine modern countries).

Kujula Kadphises/Kadphises I (15 CE – 64 CE)

- He amalgamated the five clans of *Yue-chi* tribe and laid the foundations of a unified Kushana empire.
- He minted coins in copper and believed to have imitated the Roman '*aurei*' type coins to facilitate trade.
- His coins have been found south of the Hindu Kush, which suggests that during his reign the Kushanas probably started their movement towards Indian sub-continent.
- His coins also suggest an association with Buddhism.
- He adopted the epithet '*dharmathida*' and '*sachadharmathida*'.

Vima Kadphises/Wema Kadphises II (64CE – 78 CE)

- He was the son of Kadphises I and started as a co-ruler with his father for some time but later also ruled independently. He conquered Gandhara from the Parthians and further spread the kingdom to the east of the Indus till Mathura region. The political significance of Kanishka's rule lies in the fact that he integrated central Asia with north India as a part of a single empire. It resulted in the intermingling of different cultures and increase in inter-regional trading activities.
- He issued a large number of gold coins.
- He was a firm devotee of Shiva and proclaimed himself as 'Mahishvara' on his coins.
- All his coins (both gold and copper) have unmistakable sign of Shiva with his trident bull.

**Kanishka** (78CE – 101 CE)

– He was the son of Kadphises II and is perhaps the most famous Kushana king, under whose reign the Kushana empire reached its zenith. It expanded from Central Asia to Afghanistan and north-western India, to further east into the Ganga valley and southwards into the Malwa region, and included Varanasi, Kaushambi, and Shravasti in Uttar

Pradesh and Sanchi in Madhya Pradesh. The centre of this huge empire was Bactria, as evident in the use of the Bactrian language in Kanishka's coins and inscriptions.

- The famous Rabatak Inscription (in modern Baghran province, Afghanistan) presents valuable information on Kanishka.
- Adopted the title of 'Devputra', and has been shown wearing a 'peaked helmet' on some coins.

![](_page_15_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Kanishka Coin**

- Kanishka had two capitals:
  - Purushapura (present day Peshawar): He built a giant

*stupa* to house the Buddha's relics in the city of Purushpura. The building was still intact with all its magnificence when the Chinese pilgrim Fa-Hien visited the area later in the early fifth century CE.

- Mathura
- He is remembered for two major reasons:
  - Started the Shaka era (78 CE), which is accepted as the beginning of his reign, and which is now used by the Government of India for its calendar. The probable explanation as to why the name Shaka era and not Kushana era probably lies in the belief that either Kanishka was mistakenly considered a Shaka, or that the era was in continuous use throughout the reigns of the Shakas *kshatrapa*s of Western India, who acknowledged the overlordship of the Kushanas.
  - Held the fourth Buddhist council at Kundalavana (near Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir) under the presidency of Vasumitra. Kanishka was a great patron of Buddhism. It was in this council that Buddhism was split into two schools – the Hinayana and the Mahayana. According to legends, it was Passa, a Buddhist monk who advised Kanishka to commence the fourth Buddhist Council.
- He patronised great scholars and eminent personalities of that era such as:
  - a. **Ashvagosha**: A Buddhist scholar who wrote the hagiographic *Buddhacharita* (the sacred biography of the Buddha) and composed the *Saundarananda* (a Sanskrit *kavya*).
  - b. **Charaka**: He is known as the father of Ayurveda who wrote a book on medicine called *Charaksamhita* and also wrote the *Sasruta*.
  - c. **Vasumitra**:An eminent philosopher who authored the encyclopaedia of Buddhist philosophy called *Mahavibhasa*.

- d. **Nagarjuna**: He is often termed an Indian Einstein who proposed the Theory of Relativity in his time in the form of a *Sutra*, the *Prajna Parimata Sutra*. He was also a great exponent of the Mahayana doctrine and propounded the *Madhyamaka* (also known as *Sunyavada* School) which focuses on *sunyata* or *emptiness*
- e. **Mathara**: He was a minister who was noted for his unusual Intelligence.
- f. **Agesilaus**: A Greek engineer under whose guidance, it is believed, the great *stupa* of Purushapura was built.
- Kanishka also patronised the Gandhara and Mathura schools of sculpture. At Mathura, a headless statue of Kanishka depicting him as a warrior been found.
- He controlled the famous Silk Route in Central Asia.

**Kanishka Headless Image Mathura**

(China➝Central Asia➝Afghanistan➝Iran➝Western Asia (part of the Roman Empire)

– Another striking aspect of Kanishka's personality was his attitude of religious tolerance as the king's coinage depicts motifs drawn from a great variety of religious traditions: Indian (the motifs of the *Shiva* and the *Buddha*), Greek (motifs of Greek deities such as *Helios*, a sun god and *Selene*, moon goddess), and West Asian (such as motifs of Persian gods *Atash*, fire god, and *Mithra*, sun god).

– Towards the end of his long reign, it appears that he led an unsuccessful military expedition into Central Asia against the Chinese and was defeated by General Pan-chao and was forced to pay tribute to Chinese emperor Ho-ti.

Vasudeva II (last Kushana emperor)

– The immediate successors of Kanishka were Vasishka, Huvishka, Kanishka II (who adopted the title of 'Kaiser'), and Vasudeva I, who during his reign, around the mid 2nd century CE took the title *Shaono Shao Vasudevo Koshano*, which indicates that by this time the Kushanas were totally Indianised. Also, it was during his reign that the empire started declining. The names of these rulers and those of various *kshtatrapas* and *mahakshtrapas* are found on a number of Kharoshthi inscriptions on a massive rock at Hunza (located between the Karakoram highway and the Hunza river).

Kushana power gradually declined from the early third century CE. The Kushana empire in Afghanistan and in the area west of the Indus was supplanted by the Sassanian power (of Iran) in the mid 3rd century CE. However, some remnants of the Kushanas lingered on in the Kabul valley, Kapisa and Bactria till as late as the 4th century. The decline of the Kushanas led to the resurfacing of several polities of both monarchies and Ganas in different parts of north India (as evident from the coins, seals and inscriptions) which had been temporarily subdued by them such as:

- a. The Shaka Kshatrapas in western and central India.
- b. The Arjunayanas in Bharatpur and Alwar area.
- c. The Malavas in Punjab and some portions of adjacent Rajasthan, .
- d. The Yaudheya *Gana* in Eastern Punjab and the adjoining areas of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.
- e. The Naga Kings in and around Padmavati region (identified with Pawaya in modern Gwalior district, MP).

### **The Shaka Kshatrapas of Western India**

As discussed earlier, the Syctho-Parthians ruled through their *kshatrapas* (viceroys) and *mahakshatrapas* (subordinate rulers). In the early centuries CE, there were two important lines of *kshatrapa* rulers*the Kshaharatas* and *the Kardamakas* who continued to have a hold over parts of western India during and after the Kushana period.

#### **The Kshaharatas:**

The prominent rulers belonging to this dynasty included:

Bhumaka (around c.78 CE)

- Originally owed allegiance to Kanishka.
- His coins, with legends in Brahmi and Kharoshthi, have been found at Malwa, Ajmer area, and coastal Gujarat.

Nahapana (c.119−25 CE)

- Progressed in his career from *kshatrapa* to *mahakshatrapa* and ultimately to *rajan* (king).
- His kingdom probably had its capital at Minnagara (modern Doha located between Ujjain and Broach) and included Malwa, Gujarat, Saurashtra, northern Maharashtra, and parts of Rajasthan and lower Indus valley. An inscription of one of his *amatyas* named Aryaman has been found at Pune district.
- His coins have been found at Ajmer, Rajasthan and Nashik, Maharashtra. Some of his donative inscriptions have been found in Nashik and the Karle caves of Maharashtra.
- It is believed that the Shaka Kshatrapas were involved in continuous conflict with the Satavahanas over the suzerainty over the Deccan and control over the western seaport areas frequently changed hands. For instance, the Nashik and Pune areas seem to have been conquered by either Nahapana or his predecessors from the Satavahanas. Later, around 125 CE, Nahapana is believed to have been killed by the Satavahana ruler, Gautamiputra Satkarni, who

not only restruck Nahapana's coins but also *mentioned his victory over Nahapana in his inscriptions in the Nashik and Pune districts*. This victory is also mentioned in his mother, Gautami Balashri's, inscription.

– One inscription mentions that *a field for providing food was granted to Buddhist monks by Ushavadata* (*Nahapana's son in law*).

#### The Kardamakas

The Kardamakas are the another line of the Shaka *kshatrapa*s who ruled western India after the Kshaharatas dynasty came to an end. The prominent rulers belonging to this dynasty included:

Chashtana (around c.120 CE)

- Founder of the *Kardamaka* dynasty. Originally ruled in the Sind area as a subordinate of the Kushanas and was probably the *kshatrapa* of the South-western provinces of the Kushana empire at the time of Nahapana.
- The Kardamakas had the practice of senior (*mahakshatrapa*) and junior (*kshatrapas*) rulers. For instance, during the lifetime of Chashtana (the *mahakshatrapa*), his son Jayadaman and later his grandson Rudradaman I were *kshatrapas*.
- He was succeeded by the most famous ruler of his dynasty and his grandson Rudradaman I.

**Rudradaman I** (c.130 CE–152 CE)

- The most famous of all the Shaka *kshtarapa* rulers, who ruled in the middle of second century CE.
- His empire was spread over almost whole of western India which included Sindh, Gujarat, Konkan, Narmada Valley, Malwa and Kathiawar except the Nashik and Pune areas.
- He is famous in history because of the repairs he undertook to improve the Sudarshan Lake from Chandragupta Maurya's reign, located in the semi-arid zone of Kathiawar, and this task is described in the famous Junagarh or Girnar Inscription (dated in the Shaka year 72, i.e., 150– 151 CE). This inscription happens to be the first chaste Sanskrit royal

inscription of early India, when all others were generally composed in Prakrit.

- His other achievements are also described through this inscription. The inscription mentions that he defeated Gautamiputra Satkarni, the lord of the *Dakshinapatha*, twice, but did not destroy him as he was a close relative. Rudradaman's daughter was married to Gautamiputra Satakarni's son Vasishthiptra Pulumavi.
- Vishvasena (Last Kshatrapa ruler who ruled at the end of 3rd century BCE and belonged to the Chashtana lineage)

### **The Impact and Contribution of Contacts with Central Asia**

The *Shaka-Kushana* phase introduced various new elements to trade and agriculture, to administrative organisation, to art and literature, sculpture and pottery, science and technology, and to the Indian society

at large. In fact, Central Asian influence was felt in almost all spheres and aspects of social life. For instance:

- a. Pottery and Architecture: They introduced the use of burnt bricks for flooring and that of tiles for both flooring and roofing. The period is marked by the construction of brick walls. Red pottery techniques, which were widely used in Central Asia, were replicated in the Indian Subcontinent too. The typical pottery of this period was red ware, both plain and polished with medium to fine fabric. The distinctive pots of this period are sprinklers and spouted channels.
- b. Trade and Agriculture: Due to the establishment of intimate contacts between Central Asia and India, trade between the two regions also flourished. India imported a good deal of gold from the Altai mountains of Central Asia. Due to the extensive control of the Kushanas on the Silk Route, the economy of the Kushanas was replenished with the tolls levied from the traders and this income helped in building a large prosperous empire. It is rather pertinent to note that even though it was the Indo-Greeks who introduced gold coins in India, it was the Kushanas who were the first rulers in India to issue the gold coins on such a wide scale. The Kushanas also promoted agriculture. It is believed that the Kushanas were the pioneers in introducing and extending the areas under the large-scale irrigation.
- c. Military Knowledge and Equipments: Being excellent horsemen themselves, the Shakas and the Kushanas introduced better cavalry and popularised the use of riding horses on a large scale. They made common the use of reins, saddles and *toe-stirrups* made of rope, which facilitated the movement of the rider. They also brought in caps, helmets, and boots used by warriors. The Shakas and Kushanas introduced new dressing styles such as the turban, the tunic, trousers, heavy long coats and long boots, which were adopted not only by warrior classes but also by certain other sections of the society. The practice of making leather shoes began in India during this period in all likelihood.

- d. Administrative Organisation: The Central Asian conquerors introduced new styles in administration. For instance, the Indo-Greeks introduced the practice of military governorship wherein they appointed military governors called *strategos* while the Kushanas introduced the '*Satrap'* system of government, under which the empire was divided into numerous *satrapis* and each *satrapi* was placed under the rule of a *satrap*. These systems led to the development of a feudatory organisation wherein these Central Asian conquerors established their supremacy over numerous small princes who regularly paid tributes to them. The Shakas and the Kushanas strengthened the idea of the divine origin of kingship. They took the title of 'Deviputra', that is, the sons of god.
- e. Indian Society: One of the striking aspect about the Central Asians conquerors was that not only did they assimilate with the India society, but they also added new ingredients to Indian culture and enriched it immensely. They completely identified themselves with Indian culture. Since they did not have their own script, written language or any organised religion, they adopted these components of culture from India. It would be not wrong to state that in no other period of ancient history were foreigners assimilated in Indian society on such a large scale as they were in the post-Maurya period. Since most of them came as conquerors they were absorbed as *kshatriyas*. Even in the *Manusmriti*, the Shakas and Parthians are described by Manu as the *vratya-kshatriyas* (second class kshatriyas*)* who had deviated from their duties of sacrificial rituals and thus fallen in status.

The rulers not only adopted the Indian societal norms but also adopted the popular religions of that time. For instance, some of them converted to Vaishnavism (the worship of Vishnu), as in the case of Greek ambassador Heliodorus who set up a pillar in honour of Vasudeva. A few others adopted Buddhism, as in the case of the Greek ruler Menander who became a Buddhist. Similarly, the Kushana rulers worshipped both Shiva and the Buddha and the images of these two

gods appeared on the Kushana coins.

The origin of Mahayana Buddhism owes a lot to the Central Asian influence. The monks and nuns could not afford to lose the cash donations from the growing body of traders and artisans and thus now started accepting gold and silver, took to non-vegetarian food and wore elaborate robes (as substantiated by the discovery of large number of coins in the monastic areas of Nagarjunakonda in Andhra Pradesh). The disciplined life of the *sangha* was also deserted by a few to resume their householder's life and earlier the things associated with the Buddha which were worshipped as his symbols were replaced with his images. This new form of Buddhism which venerated and worshipped images of the Bodhisattvas came to be called Mahayana Buddhism and Kanishka was a great patron of this form of Buddhism who not only organised the fourth Buddhist Council but also set up many other *stupa*s to perpetuate the memory of the Buddha. The fundamental difference between Mahayana and Hinayana school can be seen in the following box.

- f. Art and Literature: Art in the post-Mauryan period was predominantly religious. Two most important features concerning art and architecture of this period are the construction of stupa*s* and development of regional schools of sculpture.
  - i. *Stupa*s: A *stupa* is a large *hemispherical dome* with a central chamber in which relics of the Buddha or some Buddhist monk is kept in a small casket. The base was surrounded by a path for *pradakshina* (clockwise circumambulation), enclosed by wooden railings which were later made in stone. Three prominent *stupas* of this period are at Bharhut (which dates to the middle of the second century BCE and is significant for its sculptures; its railings are made of red stone), Sanchi (three big *stupas* were constructed at Sanchi in this period; the biggest of the three, which was built originally by emperor Ashoka, was enlarged to twice its size sometime in the second century BCE), and Amravati and Nagarjunkonda (both in Andhra Pradesh). A number of *stupas* were also constructed in south India during this period but none has survived in its entirety.
  - ii. Schools of Sculptural Art: Idols of the Buddha were carved

out for the first time in this period. The Central Asian rulers became enthusiastic patrons of Indian art and literature and showcased great zeal in establishing new schools of art. There were three major schools of sculptural art which developed in this period. These were: Gandhara School of art, Mathura school of art, and Amravati school of art.

The Kushana empire brought together masons and artisans trained in different art forms and belonging to different nationalities, which further enriched the diverse cultures. There was a synthesis of both local (Indian) and Central Asian elements in the new images of Buddha. Indian craftsmen came into contact with the central Asians, Greeks and Romans, especially in the north-western frontier of India in Gandhara. This gave rise to a new kind of art form known as Gandhara school of art wherein the theme of sculptures is predominantly Buddhist but their style is Greek. Chief characteristics of the Gandhara school of art lies in its beautiful portrayal of human figures with distinguished muscles of the body. The Buddha is depicted with a garment draped in Graeco-Roman fashion, and with very curly hair. These beautiful images of the Buddha are ranked among the best pieces of sculptures to have been recovered. The stone used for making idols of Buddha and Bodhisattava was predominantly blue-grey schist.

The influence of Gandhara art also spread to Mathura (which was primarily a centre of an indigenous school of art). The Mathura artists used local red stone with black spots to make the images. Mathura has also yielded large numbers of sculptures of Jaina deities besides the *ayagapatas* or stone slabs to place objects of worship. The Brahmanical influence on the art school of Mathura is also evident. During the Kushana period, a number of sculptures of Brahmanical deities were carved, which included *Kartikeya*, *Vishnu*, *Kubera*. Mathura not only produced beautiful stone images of Buddha and Mahavira but it is also famous for the headless erect statue of Kanishka. A lot of stone sculpture belonging to both the Gandhara and Mathura schools of art were produced in the Kushana period and form a part of the great cultural heritage of India. Alongwith the stone sculptures, beautiful

Buddhist caves were also constructed out of rocks in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Numerous rock panels depicting different stories connected with Buddha are found at Nagarjunakonda, Gaya, Sanchi, Bharhut, and Amravati.

The Amravati school of art flourished in Andhra Pradesh between the lower valleys of the rivers Krishna and Godavari. The main patrons of this art form were the Satavahanas, but it carried on even later, patronised by their successor Ikshavaku rulers. This school of art is said to have flourished between 150 BCE and 350 CE. Sculptures of this school are mainly found on the railings, plinths, and other parts of *stupas*. The thematic representations include the stories from the life of the Buddha. An important characteristic of the Amravati school is the 'narrative art'. The medallions were carved in such a manner that they depict an incident in a natural way. For example, one medallion depicts a whole story of 'taming of an elephant by the Buddha'. Another important feature of Amravati art is the use of white marble-like stone to carve out the figures. There is a prominence of human figures in comparison to figures drawn from nature.

The Central Asian rulers also patronised and helped in the growth of Sanskrit literature. The earliest specimen of *kavya* style and that too in chaste Sanskrit is found in the Junagadh Inscription of Rudradaman I. Some of the great creative authors such as Ashvaghosha enjoyed the patronage of the Kushanas. Some of the important Buddhist texts such as *Mahavastu* and *Divyavadana* belonged to this period. The progress of Mahayana Buddhism led to the composition of numerous *avadanas* which were aimed to popularise the Mahayana sect and were composed in Buddhist hybrid Sanskrit. The Greeks contributed to the development of the Indian theatre by introducing the use of the curtain, which was called *yavanika*. One of the earliest erotic works on sex and love making, the *Kamasutra*, was composed during this time by Vatsyayana, which is also one of the best examples of secular literature of this period.

g. Science and Technology: Post-Mauryan Indian astronomy and astrology has a huge Greek influence. The term *'horashastra*' used for astrology in Sanskrit was derived from the Greek term

'horoscope'. The Greek coins, which were properly shaped and stamped, were a great improvement on punch marked coins. The largest number of copper coins were issued by the Kushanas. Working in glass-making during this period was especially influenced by foreign practices and in no other period in ancient India did glass-making make such progress as it did during this period.

### **The Satavahanas**

As we have discussed earlier, that the Maurya rule was succeeded by the Sungas and the Kanvas in the north. However, in Deccan and in central India, the Satavahanas succeeded the Mauryas though after a gap of almost 100 years. On the basis of unearthing of many local rulers' coins (such as coins of the Kura rulers found at Brahmapuri, other local rulers such as Gobhadra, Samigopa, Chimuka, Kamvaya and Narana coins found at different locations), it is generally accepted that after the decline of the Mauryas and before the advent of the Satavahanas, there must have been numerous small political principalities that were ruling in different parts of the Deccan. Probably, the *Rathikas* and *Bhojikas* mentioned in the Ashokan inscriptions gradually progressed into the *maharathis* and *mahabhojas* of pre-Satavahana times.

The Satavahanas are considered identical with the 'Andhras' of the *Puranas*. However, interestingly, neither the name *Andhra* appears in Satavahana inscriptions, nor do the *Puranas* speak of the Satavahanas (only refer to *Andhras*). According to some *Puranas*, the *Andhras* ruled for 300 years with their capital at Pratishthana (modern Paithan) on the Godavari in Aurangabad district. This is also the period designated to the Satavahana Dynasty. The earliest Satavahana inscriptions belong to the 1st century BCE, when they defeated the Kanvas and established their rule over parts of central India. It is also pertinent to note that the early Satavahana kings appeared not in Andhra but in north Maharashtra (the fertile basin of the upper Godavari valley), where their earliest coins and inscriptions have been found. Gradually, they

extended their power over Karnataka and Andhra. Their greatest competitors were the Shaka Kshatrapas of Western India, who had established themselves in the upper Deccan and western India. Control of the prominent seaports such as *Bhrigukachcha* (Broach), Kalyan, and *Suparaka* (Sopara) must have been a bone of contention between the two.

The Satavahanas claimed *Brahmana* descent and performed Vedic rituals and worshipped gods like Krishna, Vasudeva, as evident in the Naneghat cave inscription of Naganika (1st century BCE), which mentions the great sacrifices performed by Satkarni I. Another striking feature of the kings pertaining to this dynasty was that they used matronyms such as Gautamiputra and Vashishthiputra, although they were not matrilineal or matriarchal in any sense. The Satavahanas assumed the title of *Dakshinapathapati* (*Lord of the Dakshinapatha*). The Satavahanas are also known in history for starting the practice of giving royal grants of land to Brahmanas and Buddhist monks, including those associated with tax exemptions. It is mentioned in one of the inscriptions of Gautamiputra Satkarni that *the land gifted to the Brahmanas was not to be entered or disturbed by the royal troops, was not to be dug for salt, was* free from the control of state officials, and was to enjoy all sorts of pariharas (*immunities*). They also promoted Buddhism by granting land to the monks.

Simuka

- Founder of the Satavahana Dynasty and was immediately active after Ashoka's death.
- Built Jain and Buddhist temples.

Gautamiputra Satkarni (c.106–130 CE)

– It appears initially the Shaka Kshatrapas of Western India succeeded in dislodging the Satavahanas from the western and central region, but later the fortunes of the Satavahanas were revived by its most famous ruler, Gautamiputra Satkarni. He not only defeated the Shakas but also raised the power and prestige of the Satvahanas to greater heights. It was under his reign that the empire was at its peak.

– He claimed to have destroyed the Kshaharta lineage, to which his adversary Nahapana belonged, and restruck under his name more than 8000 silver coins of Nahapana. He also wrested Malwa and Kathiawar from the Shakas. His empire extended from Malwa in the north to Karnataka in the south, having general authority over the present day Andhra region.

- His achievements are described and eulogised after his death, during his son Pulumayi II's reign, in a Nashik Inscription of his mother Gautami Balashri (written in Prakrit). In this inscription, *he is described as the destroyer of the Shakas, Pahlavas, and the Yavanas, as the uprooter of the Kshaharatas and as the restorer of the glory of the Satvahanas*.
- In the Nashik inscription, he is also described as *ekabamhana* (a peerless Brahmana) and *khatiya-dapamanamada* (one who destroyed the high handedness and pride of the Kshatriyas).
- He donated land to the Buddhist monks, the *Mahasamghikas*, at Karle (the Karle Inscription mentions the grant of 'Karajika' village near modern Pune, Maharashtra) and at Nashik (as evident in the Nashik Inscription, dated in the 18th year of Gautamiputra's reign which mentions that this piece of land was earlier in the possession of Nahapana's son in law Ushavadata).
- He assumed title of *Rajaraja* and *Maharaja*.
- In the later period of his reign, he probably lost some of the conquered Kshaharata territories to the Kardamaka line of the Shaka Kshatrapas of Western India, as evident in the Junagadh Inscription of the Rudradaman I.

Vashishthiputra Pulumayi (c. 130–154 CE)

- His coins are found in the various parts of Andhra.
- The Shakas Kshatrapas of Western India probably recovered some of their territories due to his engagements in the east.
- According to the Junagadh Inscription, he married the

#### daughter of Rudradaman I.

**Ship on Lead Coin of Vasisthiputra Sri Pulamavi**

Yajna Sri Satakarni (c. 165–194 CE)

- One of the later kings who recovered north Konkan and Malwa from the Shaka rulers.
- Lover of trade and navigation, as evident from the motif of ship on his coins.

The successors of Yajnashri Satakarni included Gautamiputra Vijaya Satakarni, Chanda Satakarni, Vasisthiputra Vijaya Satkarni, Pulumavi, and Hala (probably the 17th king in the line, also a great poet who authored the *Gatha Sattasai*, which is a collection of 700 erotic poems

in the Maharashtri Prakrit dialect). In the mid 3rd century CE, the Satavahana dynasty came to an end and various forces came into power in their stead: the Vakatakas in the Deccan, the Kadambas in Mysore, the Abhiras in Maharashtra, and the Ikshvakus in Andhra emerged as the main rulers.

### **Important Aspects of the Satavahanas**

#### **Polity and Adminstration**

The Satavahana king was represented as the upholder of *dharma* and he generally strove for the royal and divine ideal set forth in the *dharmashastra*s. In order to attribute divinity to kingship, most kings were represented as possessors of supernatural powers and of qualities of mythical heroes such as Rama, Arjuna, Bhima, and so on. The Satavahanas retained some of the administrative units of Ashokan times. The kingdom was divided into subdivisions called *aharas* or *rashtras*, meaning districts. There were also officers called *amatyas*/mahamatras who were perhaps ministers or advisors of the king. But, unlike Mauryan times, certain military and feudal traits are found in the administration of the Satavahanas. For instance the *senapati* was appointed provincial governor. It was probably done to keep the tribal people who were not thoroughly Brahmanised under strong military control. The lowest level of administration was a *grama* (village), which was under the charge of a *gaulmika* (village headman), who was also the head of a military regiment consisting of nine chariots, nine elephants, 25 horses and 45 foot soldiers. The military character of the Satavahanas is also evident with the use of terms like *kataka* and *skandhavaras* in their inscriptions, which denote military camps and settlements attached to a particular king and also served as administrative centres. The Satavahana kingdom had three grades of feudatories:

- a. *Raja* (who had right to strike coins)
- b. *Mahabhoja*
- c. *Senapati*

Revenue was collected both in cash and kind. The Satavahana kings were the first in Indian history to make tax-free land grants to Buddhists and Brahmanas to gain religious merit. This practice became more prominent in succeeding periods.

#### **Material Culture**

As the Satavahanas acted as a bridge between North and South India, similarly their material culture was a fusion of both local Deccan elements as well as northern ingredients. Through contacts with the north, the people of Deccan learnt the use of coins, burnt bricks, ringwells, the art of writing, and so on. There was regular use of fire-baked bricks and the use of flat, perforated roof tiles which must have aided in the longevity of the construction. For instance, in Karimnagar, as many 22 brick walls have been discovered. The drains were covered and were also underground to lead waste water into soakage pits. They were also fairly acquainted with the use of iron and agriculture. They probably exploited the rich mineral resources of Deccan such as iron ores from Karimnagar and Warangal and gold from Kolar fields. Unlike the gold coins of the Kushanas, they mostly issued lead coins (which they probably imported from the Romans) apart from copper and bronze coins. The Deccan developed a very advanced rural economy. The people knew about the art of paddy transplantation and especially the area on the confluence of the rivers Krishna and

Godavari formed a great rice bowl. The Satavahanas also produced cotton and in different foreign accounts, Andhra was famous for its cotton products.

#### **Social Organisation**

Since the Andhras are identified with the early Satavahanas, they were probably a local Deccan tribe who were gradually Brahamnised. The Satavahana kings (such as Gautamiputra Satkarni) claimed to be Brahmans and considered it their primary duty to uphold the *varna* system, that is, the four-fold division of social structure determined by caste. Kings and queens performed Vedic sacrifices and worshipped

Vaishnava gods such as Krishna and Vasudeva. Though they made liberal sacrificial fees to the Brahmanas, they also promoted Buddhism by granting land to Buddhist monks, especially to Mahayana Buddhists. Nagarjunakonda and Amravati in Andhra Pradesh and Nashik and Junar areas of Maharashtra became important Buddhist sites under the Satavahanas and their successors, the Ikshvakus. Due to flourishing trade and commerce, merchants and artisans formed an important social strata. Merchants generally named themselves after the towns to which they belonged. Both artisans and merchants made generous donations to the Buddhist cause.

#### **Architecture**

During the Satavahana phase, many *chaityas* (sacred shrines) and *viharas* (monasteries) were cut out of the solid rock in the north-western Deccan or Maharashtra with great precision and skill. The Karle Chaitya in the western Deccan belongs to this era. The Nashik inscriptions of Nahapana and Gautamiputra Satakarni, which are on the walls of the three viharas , is another important architectural site belonging to this period. The official language of the Satavahanas was Prakrit, though the script was Brahmi. One famous Prakrit text, *Gathasattasai*, is attributed to a Satavahana king called Hala, which consisted of 700 verses all written in Prakrit.

#### **Early State of Kalinga**

It is well-known that the Deccan as well as eastern India were parts of Ashoka's empire. He had conquered Kalinga through a violent battle in which the loss of men and property was enormous. After Ashoka, Kalinga became prominent under the kings of Chedi dynasty. Unfortunately, not much information about the kings of the dynasty is available except Kharavela, who probably lived in the first century BCE. His achievements are recorded in an inscription, known as the Hathigumpha inscription, situated in the Udaigiri hills near Bhuvaneshvar in Orissa.

King Kharavela (c. 1st century BCE)

- Probabaly belonged to *The Mahameghavahanas* of Kalinga.
- Seems to have wrested Kalinga from Mauryans and founded an independent line of kings, the Chedis /Chetis of Kalinga.

- He is also known as Bhikshu-Raja, and he constructed a great palace known as the 'Palace of Victor'.
- Famous for the Hathigumpha Inscription, which is engraved on the Udaigiri hills near Bhuvaneshwar. It is the second inscription by Naganika after his Nanaghat inscription.
- Follower of Jainism and provided cave shelters for Jaina monks in Udaigiri Hills. The Hathigumpha Inscription proves that Jainism entered Orissa and probably became the state religion within 100 years of death of Mahavira. The inscription is so named because the image of an elephant is carved out of stone next to the boulder carrying the inscription. The inscription tells us that *he was a follower of Jainism and had fought many successful battles against his neighbours*.

### **Early historical period of South India: From Megalithic to the state polities of Chera, Cholas and Pandyas**

#### **The Megalithic background of South India**

As we know, the prehistoric age (the pre-writing phase) is generally followed by the historical period which is normally marked by the beginning of writing and written literature, more settled and stable community life, agriculture by means of iron ploughshare, the gradual rise of state system, the use of metal money and a flourishing economy, and so on. However, interestingly, all these phenomena do not emerge in a linear fashion in southern India, especially at the tip of the peninsula with the Kaveri delta as the nucleus zone, until about the 2nd century BCE. The Neolithic phase of south India, which was highlighted by the use of polished stone axe and blade tools, was succeeded by the Megalithic phase (around 1200 BCE–300 BCE). The upper portions of the peninsula were inhabited by people who were called the Megalith

builders. Quite strangely, these people are identified not from their actual settlements, which are rare, but from their graves. These graves are called Megaliths, as they were encircled with mega/big pieces of stones and were, in most cases, located outside the settlement area. These Megalith burial sites have yielded the first iron objects from south India (which include arrowheads, daggers, swords, spearheads, tridents, battle axe, hoes, ploughshares, sickles, etc.). Besides these, lot of black and red ware pottery has been found buried in these Megaliths. These artifacts, along with food grains such as wheat and rice found at various Megalithic sites, indicate that the Megalithic people followed agropastoral and hunting activities for their livelihood. They did not, in all likelihood, practice an advanced type of agriculture, since the number of agricultural tools found in the grave sites are lesser in number in comparison to tools meant for fighting and hunting. These Megaliths have been found in all upland areas of the peninsula, but their concentration is more in eastern Andhra and in Tamil Nadu. Prominent sites that have yielded Megalithic burials include Brahmagiri, Maski (Karnataka), Adichallanur (Tamilnadu), and Junapani near Nagpur (Maharashtra). It is highly likely that the Cholas, the Pandyas, and the Keralaputras (Cheras) mentioned in the Ashokan inscriptions probably belonged to the last phase of Megalithic culture. The Megalithic period in south India was followed by the Sangam age.

**Megalithic Burial**

#### **The Sangam Age and Literature** (3rd century BCE–3rd century CE)

By the 3rd century BCE, the Megalithic people moved from the uplands into the fertile river basins and reclaimed the marshy deltaic areas. On account of the influence of both material (iron technology, which promoted forest clearing and plough cultivation, distribution of punchmarked coins of the *janapada*s due to a flourishing north-south trade) and cultural contacts from north (as result of the interactions of traders, conquerors, Jaina, Buddhist, Ajivikas and Brahmana missionaries), these Megalithic communities came to practice wet paddy cultivation, founded numerous villages and towns and came to have social classes. In due time, the state system also developed in the southern India. Three early kingdoms, that of the Cholas, the Pandyas and the Cheras, emerged in the rice-growing areas of *Tamilakam* (the land between the Tirupati hills and the southernmost tip of peninsula). It is for this reason that the advent of the historical period in south India is generally dated to the 3rd century BCE, though with recent archaeological excavations at Kodumanal, the dates can be pushed backwards to at least the 4th century BCE.

The major sources of information on the political history of this time are the laudatory poems of the Sangam age literature, which is also referred to as early Classical Tamil literature. The Sangam age refers to that period in the early history of south India, when large numbers of poems in Tamil were composed by a number of authors. The term 'Sangam' refers to an assembly or 'meeting together' of Tamil poets. Traditionally, three Sangams or assemblies are believed to have been convened one after the other at different places under the patronage of the Pandya kings of Madurai. The poems were modeled on the bardic songs of older times, and were orally transmitted for an indefinite period before they were finally written down by poets who came from both cities and villages, had varied social and professional backgrounds which included both dignitaries of that time such as kings, ministers, merchants, astrologers as well as common folk such as teachers, soldiers, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, and carpenters. Sangam literature is primarily secular, and due to their varied themes and authorship,

Sangam poems offer rich, diverse vantage points of looking at everyday themes in a *Tamilakam* context.

The Sangam corpus includes six of the eight anthologies of poems included in the *Ettutokai* (The Eight Collections), and nine of the ten *pattus* (songs) of the *Pattuppattu* (The Ten Songs). The style and certain historical references in the poems suggest that this literature is most likely composed between 3rd Century BCE and 3rd century CE. Around mid-8th century, they were complied into anthologies, which were further collected into the superanthologies (the anthologies of anthologies) called the *Ettutokai* and the *Pattuppattu*. It is rather interesting to note that the anthologies include a total of 2381 poems ascribed to 473 poets, out of whom 30 poets were women. Apart from these poems, the first two books of the *Tolkappiyam* (a book on Tamil grammar and poetics written by Tolkappiyar) are also a part of the corpus of Sangam Literature. There is also mention of the *Agattiyam*, which was the first known book on Tamil grammar. It was supposedly written by the sage Agathiyar, and is believed to be lost beyond redemption. The sage Agathiyar, according to Hindu legends, brought the Tamil language and its syntax to the Tamil people from god Shiva. It is believed that Tolkappiyar, the author of *Tolkappiyam*, was the disciple of Agathiyar. Poems within Sangam literature were composed on two

broader themes of *akam* (love) and *puram* (mostly based on war but also included public poetry such as poems on good and evil, community and kingdom). A remarkable feature of Sangam literature is its vivid portrayal of the contemporary society and culture of *Tamilakam* and its peaceful and harmonious interactions with the northern (Aryan) culture. Sangam literature can be divided into two groups: narrative and didactic. The narrative texts are called Melkannakku (18 Major Works consisting of eight anthologies and ten idylls), and are considered works of heroic poetry in which heroes are glorified and perpetual wars and cattle raids are frequently mentioned. The didactic works are called Kilkanakku (18 Minor Works). A large number of Tamil didactic works such as Tiruvalluvar's *Tirukkural* (famous work on ethics, philosophy, polity, and love, and considered the fifth Veda of Tamil Nadu), Tamil epics such as *Silappadikaram* (considered the brightest gem of early Tamil literature which deals with love story of Kovalan, who prefers a courtesan Madhavi of Kaveripattnam to his noble wedded wife Kannagi) and *Manimekalai* (a sequel to *Silappaddikaram* and is considered the 'Odyssey of Tamil poetry', which deals with the adventures of the daughter born of the union of Kovalan and Madhavi and her subsequent conversion to Buddhism) were written in the period between the 5th and 6th centuries.

#### **The Three Early Kingdoms: The Pandays, the Cholas, and the Cheras**

The southern end of the Indian peninsula situated south of the Krishna river was divided amongst three early kingdoms and a large number of chieftains wherein the chieftainship was hereditary. The important *vendar* (crowned kings) who dominated the Tamilakam region during the Sangam Age were the Pandyas in the valleys of the Tamrapani (Sri Lanka) and Vaigai, the Cholas in the lower Krishna valley, and the Cheras on the Kerala coast. These kings had their own particular insignia of royalty such as the special umbrella, the drum and the staff. The Cholas, Pandyas, and Cheras had several subordinate chiefs known as *velir* (chieftains), who used to pay a regular tribute to the king. The kings and chieftains often formed alliances with one another and fought

each other. Internecine conflict was the norm of the day and this probably also gave large scope to the Sangam poets to compose poems on war.

#### **The Pandyas**

The Pandya territory occupied the southern-most and the south-eastern portion of the Indian peninsula. The Pandyas are first mentioned by Megasthenes in his *Indica*, wherein he refers to a Pandya Kingdom famous for pearls and ruled by a woman (which may suggest some matriarchal influence in the Pandya society). Even Sangam Literature mentions Pandya rulers and describes the Pandya kingdom as wealthy and prosperous. The Pandya kings profited from trade with Roman Empire and even sent embassies to the Roman emperor Augustus. They performed Vedic sacrifices and the Brahmanas in their territory enjoyed considerable influence. The early Pandya kings were Nediyon, Palshalai Mudukudumi, and other prominent Pandya kings were:

Nedunjeliyan I

– It is believed that he died of remorse due to his tragic role (as he ordered the execution) in the death of Kovalan, the hero and the husband of Kannagi of the *Silappadikaram.*

#### Nedunjeliyan II

- He is one of the most important Pandya kings and is credited with many major military victories and acquiring territories from other chieftains.
- It is believed that at a very young age, he defeated a confederacy of Cheras, Cholas and five other chieftains in the battle of *Talaiyalanganam*. In this battle, the Chera king was taken prisoner.
- Two Tamil Brahmi inscriptions from Mangulam pertaining to early 2nd century BCE mentions that a subordinate and relative of Nedunjeliyan presented gifts to Jaina monks.

A 1st century BCE inscription from Alagarmalai mentions about a person called Katumara Natan, who appears to be either a Pandyan prince or subordinate.

#### **The Cholas**

The Chola kingdom (which in early medieval times was also known as Cholamandalam/ Coromandel) was situated to the north-east of the territory of the Pandyas and between the Penner and the Velar rivers. Their chief centre of political power and capital Uraiyur was famous for cotton trade. They also maintained an efficient navy. It also appears that in the middle of 2nd century BCE, a Chola king named Elara conquered Sri Lanka and ruled it over for nearly 50 years. The Cholas were also rich and prosperous and the main source of their wealth was their trade in cotton cloth.

#### Karikala

- One of the greatest of all Chola kings, who founded its port city Puhar (modern Kaveripattanam which was a great centre of trade and commerce and had a large dock) and constructed 160 km of embankment along Kaveri river. It is mentioned that this was built with the labour of 12,000 slaves brought as captives from Sri Lanka.
- Credited with having defeated a confederacy of Pandyas, Cheras and their allies at the battle of Venni. It is mentioned

in Sangam texts that *11 rulers lost their drums in the field* (which is significant as the royal drum was an important insignia of royal power) *and the Chera king who suffered a wound in the back died of vattakirutal* (*ritual starvation*).

– He is also credited with another major victory at Vahaipparandalai in which, according to Sangam texts, several chieftains lost their umbrellas.

Tondaiman Ilandiraiyan

- Another important Chola ruler who ruled from Kanchi either as an independent ruler or as a subordinate ruler of Karikala.
- He was a gifted poet, and in one of his poems he has emphasised on the personal character of the king. He says that *in order to rule well a king should possess a strong personal character*.
- Under Karikala's successors (especially Nalangilli and Nedungilli who fought bitterly among themselves for the throne), the Chola power rapidly declined and it is believed that their neighbouring powers expanded their empire at their cost. Later, the Pallavas from north wrested a lot of their territories. From the 4th to 9th century CE, the Cholas played a marginal role in south Indian history.

#### **The Cheras**

The Cheras were situated to the west and north of the Pandyas. It was an important and prosperous kingdom owing to its trade with the Romans. It appears that the Romans had in fact set up two regiments at Muziris/Muchiri (near modern Kochi) to protect their interests and also built a temple of Augustus. The history of the Cheras was marked with continuous battles with the Cholas and the Pandyas.

#### Udiyanjeral

– Earliest known Chera king.

Nedunjeral Adan

– One of the prominent kings of Chera dynasty, who probably defeated seven crowned kings and won the coveted title of *adhiraja*.

- It is also claimed that he not only defeated an enemy on the Malabar coast but also captured several *yavana* traders and later released them after taking ransom.
- He is also believed to have fought a war against a Chola king. However, in this war unfortunately both the principal adversaries (that is to say the Chola king and Nedunjeral) lost their lives.
- Kuttuvan, the younger brother of Nedunjeral Adan, conquered Kongu and extended the power of the Cheras up to the eastern and western oceans.
- One of Adan's sons is also described as an *adhiraja* who claimed to wore a garland of seven crowns and was victorious against Anji (a chieftain of Tagadur).

#### Senguttuvan

- Was Nedunjeral Adan's son and according to Chera poets was their greatest king who is also known as the Red or Good Chera. He led many successful military expeditions. He won a battle against the Mokur chieftain.
- He has been mentioned in the post-Sangam text, *Silappadikaram*, which describes his military conquest against Viyalur in the land of Nannan and capture of the Kodukur fortress in Kongu country.
- He also successfully backed one of the claimants in a Chola succession conflict, killing the nine others.
- He also claimed to have invaded the north, and fought against an Aryan chieftain in order to obtain stone for an image of Kannagi (the heroine of the *Silappadikaram* and considered the goddess of chastity), and crossed the Ganga and had a bath in the Ganga before bringing the stone back to his country.

#### Kudakko Ilanjeral Irumporai

– One of the last Chera kings mentioned in the Sangam texts, who is also believed to have won wars against the Cholas

and Pandyas.

After the 2nd century CE, the Chera power declined and not much is known of their history till 8th century CE.

The Sangam poets also eulogise various chieftains such as Ay, Andiran, and Pari for their heroism and generosity.

### **The Administration and Social life in the Three Early Kingdoms**

#### **The Economy in Sangam Age**

The whole *Tamilakam* in this period was divided into five *tinais*, or ecozones based on their economic resources. These were: *kurinji* (hilly region); *palai* (arid zone); *mullai* (pastoral tracts); *marudam* (wet lands); and *neital* (seacoast). These zones were not clearly demarcated, and were scattered all around the region. Because of their different geographical contexts and ecological specialties, people in different *tinais* had their own modes of subsistence. For example, in *kurinji*, it was hunting and gathering; in *palai,* where people could not produce anything, they took to raiding and plundering; in *mullai* people practiced animal husbandry; in *marudam* it was plough agriculture; and in *neital* people took to fishing and salt making.

The people were engaged in various economic activities such as agriculture, crafts, and trade. Rice was the most important crop. It formed the main part of peoples' diet and also served as a medium of barter exchange for inland trade. The top of the peninsula and the adjacent regions were extremely fertile and produced paddy, ragi, sugarcane, fruit, pepper, and turmeric. Since the Tamil region does not have perennial rivers, the chiefs, wherever possible, encouraged agricultural activities by making tanks and dams. The Chola king Karikala of the Sangam age is credited with constructing a dam on the river Kaveri. It is considered to be the earliest dam in the country. Among the crafts, the most important one was spinning and weaving of textiles, cotton as well as silk. Salt manufacture was another important

activity.

The most important feature of the Sangam economy was flourishing trade with the Roman world. The best account of Indo-Roman trade is given in the book called the *Periplus of the Erythrean Sea*, which was written in the first century CE by an anonymous author. Another Roman writer, Pliny, complains in his account '*Natural History*' that Rome was drained of gold on account of her trade with India. Major items of export to the Romans were the Indian products such as spices (included *yavanapriya* or pepper), perfumes, jewels, ivory and fine textiles (muslin especially), several precious and semi-precious stones like diamond, carnelian, turquoise, agate, sapphire, and so on, besides pearls, indigo, sandalwood, iron and steel cutlery. Against this import, Romans exported gold and silver to India. It is confirmed by the recovery of a large number of Roman gold coins in south India. Other important items of export from the Roman empire included wine, which is indicated by wine amphorae and shards of Roman wares found in significant numbers at Arikamedu in south India. Besides these, the western traders also brought tin, lead, coral, and slave girls to the subcontinent.

After the discovery of the monsoons by Hippatus, a Greek navigator, in 45 CE, more and more sea voyages were used for trading purposes. The discovery of the monsoons and the use of a direct sea route between Indian coasts and the western world as well as south-east Asia was the main reason for the growth of trade. Important ports of India on the western coast were Bharukachchha (Broach), Sopara, Kalyana, and Muziris. Ships from these ports sailed to the Roman Empire through the Red Sea. Trade with south-east Asia was conducted through the sea. Prominent ports on the eastern coast of India were Tamralipti (West Bengal), Arikamedu (Tamil Nadu Coast), and so on. Sea trade was also conducted between Bharukachchha and the ports of south-east Asia.

The economy of all the three kingdoms flourished due to large-scale local and long distance trade. It led to rise of important towns and craft centres in the Tamil region. Vanji, the capital of the Cheras, was an important centre of trade and craft. Muziris/Muchiri on the south-west coast was the foremost port of the Cheras. It is believed that the Roman

ships laden with gold used to land here and took back large amounts of pepper. An interesting 2nd century document, the *Vienna Papyrus*, records *an agreement regarding transportation of goods between two merchants based in Alexandria and Muchiri*. Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas, was an important centre of fine textile and ivory working. Korkai, in the Tirunnelveli district of Tamil Nadu, was an important Pandya port which was famous for its pearls. Uraiyur (Tiruchirapalli in Tamil Nadu), the capital of the Cholas, was a grand city with magnificent buildings. Kaveripattinam or Puhar was the main Chola port. The Sangam poems refer to the busy markets guarded by soldiers who in order to ensure the safety of merchants and prevent smuggling, used to maintain constant vigil on the trade routes. Transit duties were collected from merchants who moved their goods from place to place. Tribute from subordinate chiefs along with plunder and spoils of the war were the main sources of revenue.

### **Social Structure and Organisation**

In the Tamil Brahmi inscriptions found at several places, kings are addressed as *ko* and chieftains as *ko* or *kon*. The *Brahmanas* first appeared in the Tamil land in the Sangam age. Many *Brahmanas* functioned as poets and were generously rewarded by the king. Though the concept of *varna* was known, social classes in the early Sangam period were not marked by acute caste distinctions (this phenomenon appeared in later stages). For instance, *Brahmanas* were present in the society and they performed Vedic ceremonies and sacrifices and also acted as advisers to the chief, but they enjoyed no special privileges and also took meat and wine. The *Kshatriyas* and *Vaishyas* appear as regular *varna* in the Sangam texts. The more relevant basis of stratification was *kuti* (clan-based descent groups) where there was no real restriction on inter-dining and social interaction among the *kuti* groups. The ruling class was called *arasar*, and its members had marriage relation with the *vellalas* (rich peasants), which formed the fourth caste of peasants. The *vellalas* held the bulk of land, and employed *kadaisiyan* (agricultural labour) to do the manual farm work. Some agricultural labourers known

as *pariyars* also worked in animal skins and used them as mats. People were known on the basis of their occupation they followed, such as artisans, salt merchants, textile merchants, etc. There were sharp social inequalities in the age of the Sangam. The rich lived in well-decorated brick houses and wore costly clothes whereas the poor lived in mud huts and had scanty clothes to wear.

The class of warriors was an important element in polity and society. Commanders of the army were credited with the title of *enadi* at a formal ceremony. The state maintained a rudimentary army which consisted of chariots drawn by oxen, elephants, cavalry, and infantry. Elephants played an important role in war while horses were imported by sea. War heroes occupied a special position in society, and memorial stones called *nadukal* or virukkal were raised in honour of those who died in fighting, and they were worshipped as god.

In the domain of religion, the Sangam period witnessed a close and peaceful interaction between north Indian and south Indian traditions. The *Brahmanas* who performed religious ceremonies popularised the worship of Indra, Vishnu, and Shiva in south India. The Sangam poems reflect the emergence of new bases of royal prestige and legitimacy by performing Brahmanical sacrifices. For instance, a Pandya ruler, Mudukudumi, took the title *Palshalai* (one who has many sacrificial halls). There are also references to the presence of Buddhists and Jainas in Tamil region. The local people, particularly those of the hills, worshipped a deity called *Murugan*, which was identified with Kartikeya,a war god in northern India and was later called Subramaniya in Medieval times. The Megalithic practice of providing for the dead continued in the Sangam Age too, as people offered rice to the dead. Cremation was also introduced. Sangam texts also reflect a belief in sacred or magical forces called *ananku*, that were supposed to inhabit different objects. The job of carrying out rites and rituals to correct the *ananku* was entrusted to lower castes of *pariyans, pananas*, and *velans* who were generally associated with ritualistic dancing, singing, with lighting the cremation fire and worshipping *natukal* (memorial stones). *Ananku* was also believed to cling to women and it was generally believed that if a women was chaste, her *ananku* would be under control

and had auspicious potential.

Women in the Sangam period appear to have been educated. This is testified by many poems contributed by women poets to the corpus of Sangam literature. Women are also described as engaged in various economic activities such as paddy plantation, cattle rearing, basketmaking, spinning, etc. However, the cruel practice of Sati was also prevalent in Tamil society, and it was known as *tippayadal*. But it was not obligatory as there are references to widows present in society. However, the position of widows was miserable as they were prohibited to decorate themselves or participate in any form of amusement. Sangam poems also mention of *chevilittai*, who were like foster mothers and seem to be closely associated with family members.

### **Crafts, Trade, and Towns in the Post Mauryan Age**

The period pertaining to the Shakas, the Kushanas, the Satavahanas and the three early kingdoms (that is, the period from 3rd century BCE to 2nd century CE) was the most flourishing period in the history of crafts and commerce in ancient India. Production of crafts started growing in this period with tremendous impetus, as trade and commerce, both internal and foreign, was dependent to a great extent on the craft activities. The *Digha Nikaya*, which belongs to pre-Maurya times, mentions nearly two dozen occupations but the *Mahavastu*, which belongs to this period catalogues 36 kinds of workers. Similarly, the *Milindapanho* mentions 75 occupations, of which 60 were associated with crafts. The level of specialisation was very high and as many as eight crafts were associated with the working of gold, silver, lead, tin, copper, brass, iron and precious stones or jewels, which employed separate artisans working in each craft. The technological advancement in iron is evident by the excavation of sophisticated iron artifacts, specially from the Karimnagar and Nalgonda districts of Telangana region. Indian iron and steel, including cutlery, were exported to as far as Abyssinian ports and were in high demand in western Asian countries.

The manufacturing in textiles, silk-weaving, arms, luxury articles,

handicrafts and terracotta figurines, made rapid progress during this period. The textile industry was a prominent industry. Mathura (famous for a special type of cloth called *shataka*) and Vanga (eastern Bengal) were famous for variety of cotton and silk textiles. The discovery of some dyeing vats at some sites in south India such as Uraiyur and Arikamendu indicates that dyeing was a thriving craft in the area during this period. Ujjain was a prominent bead-making centre. The shell industry was in a thriving state, and many shell products belonging to the Kushana period have been excavated. Coin-minting was an important craft, and this period is noted for numerous types of coins made of gold, silver, copper, bronze, potin, and lead. Interestingly, the craftsmen even made fake Roman coins. The beautiful pieces of terracotta found in profuse quantities in almost all Kushana and Satavahana sites, especially Yelleshwaram in Nalgonda district, are truly masterpieces. It is generally believed that terracotta was meant mostly for the use of upper classes in towns. The artisans in this period touched new heights of prosperity, and there are numerous inscriptions which refer to the donations made by artisans to monasteries.

The communities of merchants were organised in groups known as *shreni* or guilds under the head called *sreshthi*. Another type of mercantile group was called *sartha*, which signified mobile or caravan trading corporation of interregional traders. The leader of such a guild was called *sarthavaha*. Like merchants, almost all craft vocations were also organised into guilds, each under a headman called *jetthaka*/pamukkha. These included weavers, corn dealers, bamboo workers, oil manufacturers, potters, etc. The guilds were associations of merchants and craftsmen following the same profession or dealing in the same commodity. They elected their head and framed their own rules regarding prices and quality to regulate their business on the basis of mutual goodwill. They also served as banks and received deposits from the public on a fixed rate of interest. It is interesting to note that around the 2nd century CE, in Maharashtra, lay devotees of Buddhism deposited money with the guilds of potters, oil millers, and weavers for providing robes and other necessities to the monks. Similarly, at Mathura at the same time, there is mention of deposit of money with a

chief of flour guild for serving daily to the Brahmanas. The *Yajnavalkya Smriti* refers to the qualifications and powers of guild officers and also hints towards judicial role of guilds. The guilds heads used to have a good rapport with the king, and according to some Buddhist texts, they used to accompany the king as a part of the official entourage. Sometimes, they were also appointed as *mahamatta*. Certain officials known as the *bhandagarika* were appointed to keep a record of the transactions and conventions of guilds, as mentioned in the *Nigrodha Jataka*. These royal officers had some authority over the guilds. Some guilds also had a *shrenibala*, which was some sort of a corporate organisation of warriors maintained by these guilds. The importance of the guilds can be gauged by the fact that some guilds also issued coins and seals. Some coins found at Taxila have the legend *negama*, while two copper coins found at Kaushambi bear the legend *gadhikanam*. Some seals with the captions *nigama, nigamasya* have been found at the sites of Rajghat (seals with the legend of *gavayaka*, signifying guild of milkmen), Bhita (seals with the legend of *shulaphalayikanam*, signifying guild of makers of arrowheads), and Ahichchhatra (seals with the legend of *kumhakara*, signifying guild of potters).

One of the most important features of the post-Mauryan period was the growth of trade and commerce, both internally as well as externally. As we have discussed earlier, there were two major internal land routes in ancient India — Uttarapatha, which connected northern and eastern parts of India with the northwestern fringes, and Dakshinapatha, which connected peninsular India with the western and northern parts of India. The Dakshinapatha started from Kaushambi near Allahabad, ran through Ujjaiyini (modern Ujjain) extended further up to Bhrigukaccha or Broach, an important port on western coast. The Dakshinapatha was further connected with Pratishthana (modern Paithan), the capital of the Satavahanas. We have already discussed about the flourishing trade and the different items of import and export of the three early southern kingdoms with Rome and south-east Asia. Interestingly, in addition to the articles directly supplied by India, certain articles were brought to India from China and Central Asia and then sent to the eastern part of the Roman empire. For instance, earlier silk was directly sent from

China to the Roman empire through the famous Silk Route, but after the annexation of Iran by Parthians, silk was diverted to the western Indian ports through the north-western part of the subcontinent and sometimes it was also transported via the east coast to west coast of the subcontinent. Thus the period c.200 BCE−300 CE was marked by urban prosperity all over India. More is known about the urban centres than the villages of this period.
