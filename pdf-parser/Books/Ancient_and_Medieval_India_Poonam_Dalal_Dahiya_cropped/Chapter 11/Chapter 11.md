# 11 THE DELHI SULTANATE

As we have discussed in the last chapter, invasions by Mahmud of Ghazni and Mohd. Ghori into India ultimately resulted in the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate. Five different dynasties–the Slave, the Khalji, the Tughlaq, the Sayyids, and the Lodhi's are collectively referred to as the Delhi Sultanate. The rulers, termed as Sultans, were of Turkish and Afghan origin. Not only did they extend their rule over North India (i.e., Malwa and Gujarat), but they also penetrated into the Deccan and South India. The Sultanate's rule resulted in far-reaching changes in the Indian society, administration and cultural life.

The Slave dynasty was also called the Mameluk dynasty. *'Mameluk'* was the Arabic word meaning 'owned', used to distinguish the important Turkish slaves chiefly meant for military service from the lower slaves, who were used as domestic labour or artisans. In fact, three dynasties were established during this period. They were:

- 1. Qutbi dynasty (c.1206–1211 CE ) founded by Qutbuddin Aibak.
- 2. First Ilbari dynasty (c.1211–1266 CE) founded by Iltutmish.

3. Second Ilbari dynasty (c.1266–1290 CE) founded by Balban. Qutub-ud-din Aibak (c.1206–10 CE)

– Founder of the Slave dynasty; considered by many scholars as the real founder of Muslim rule in India.

**Qutub-ud-din Aibak**

- He was a Turkish slave of Muhammad Ghori, who played an important role in the expansion of the Turkish Sultanate in India after the Battle of Tarain and was made the governor of Ghori's Indian possessions. He raised a standing army and established his hold over north India even during the lifetime of Ghori.
- After the death of Ghori in c. 1206 CE, Tajuddin Yaldauz, the ruler of Ghazni, claimed his rule over Delhi and Nasiruddin Qabacha, the governor of Multan and Uchch aspired for independence. Along with this all, he also had to face many revolts from Rajputs and other Indian chiefs. The successor of Jaichand, Harishchandra, had driven out the Turks from Badayun and Farukhabad. However, Aibak was able to win over his enemies by conciliatory measures as well as a display of power. He defeated Yaldauz and severed all connections with Ghazni. Aibak also re-

conquered both Badayun and Farukhabad and thus founded the Slave dynasty as well as the Delhi Sultanate.

- He assumed the title of 'Sultan' and made Lahore his capital.
- He did not issue any coins and was formally recognised after three years.
- Known as *'Lakh Baksh'* or giver of lakhs for his magnanimity, as he gave a lot of liberal donations.
- Built the first mosque in India – *Quwwat-ul-Islam* (Delhi)
- Also built: *Arhai din ka jhonpara* (Ajmer)
- Patronised:
  - Great scholar Hasan Nizami – *Taj-ul-Massir*
  - Fakh-ul-din – *Tarikh-i-Mubarakshahi*
- Started construction of the Qutub Minar (only the first storey) in the memory of the famous Sufi saint, Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakthiyar Kaki (it was later completed by Iltutmish).
- Aibak died suddenly in c.1210 CE, while playing *Chaugan* (horse polo).

#### Aramshah (c.1210 CE)

- Son of Qutbuddin Aibak, who succeeded his father but was an incapable ruler, and a weak and worthless young man. The Turkish amirs opposed him. He ruled for a mere eight months.
- The Turkish chiefs of Delhi invited the governor of Badayun, Iltutmish (son-in-law of Qutbuddin Aibak), to come to Delhi. Iltutmish disposed of Aram Shah and became the Sultan with the name of Shamsuddin. The credit of consolidating the Delhi Sultanate lies largely with him.

#### Iltutmish (c.1210–1236 CE)

– The real consolidator of Turkish rule in India. He belonged to the Ilbari tribe and hence his dynasty also known as the Ilbari dynasty. Legends describe that his half-brothers sold him as a slave to Aibak, who made him his-son-in law by

giving his daughter in marriage to him. Later, Aibak appointed him as the Iqtadar of Gwalior. After becoming Sultan, he shifted his capital from Lahore to Delhi.

- During the first 10 years of his reign, he concentrated on securing his throne from his rivals. The commanders of Muhammad Ghori like Yaldauz, Qabacha (of Multan), and Ali Mardan (of Bihar and Bengal) rose in defiance again. The chief of Jalore and Ranthambore joined Gwalior and Kalinjar in declaring their independence. Apart from this, the rising power of the Mongols under Chenghiz Khan threatened the North-West Frontier of the Sultanate.
- Iltutmish took up the task of consolidating his position. He defeated Yaldauz in c.1215 CE in the Battle of Tarain. In c.1217 CE, he drove away Qabacha from Punjab.
- In c.1220 CE, Temujin, popularly known as Chengiz Khan, the leader of the Mongols, started invading Central Asia and destroyed the Khwarizm empire. Jalaluddin Mangbarani, the son of the Shah of Khwarizm, while escaping from the Mongols, sought shelter at Iltutmish's court, but Iltutmish refused to grant asylum to him. So with his diplomatic skills, he prevented Mongol attack and saved India from the wrath of Chengiz Khan.
- From c.1225 CE onwards, Iltutmish engaged his armies in suppressing the disturbances in the East. In c.1226–27 CE, Iltutmish sent a large army under his son Nasiruddin Mahmud, which defeated Iwaz Khan and brought Bengal and Bihar back into the Delhi Sultanate. Similarly, a campaign was also launched against the Rajput chiefs. Ranthambore was captured in c.1226CE and by c.1231 CE, Iltutmish had established his authority over Mandor, Jalore, Bayana, and Gwalior. He also attacked Nagda, the capital of Mewar, but had to retreat at the arrival of the Gujarat armies. As a revenge, he led an expedition against the Chalukyas of Gujarat but it was not successful.
- He divided his empire into *Iqtas* (assignment of land in lieu

of salary). Every Iqtadars had to maintain law and order and collect revenue. After deducting own salary and expenses, they had to send the surplus to central government. As a matter of fact, the *Iqtadars* were transferable.

- Organised *turkan-i-chahalgani*, a new class of ruling elite of forty powerful military leaders, the Forty. These were Turkish amirs (nobles) who advised and helped the Sultan in administering the Sultanate. After the death of Iltutmish, this group assumed great power in its hands. For a few years they decided on the selection of Sultans one after the other. The group was finally eliminated by Balban.
- His authority was recognised by the Abbasid Caliph of Baghdad in c.1229 CE as he received the *mansur* (the letter of recognition/ Investiture), by which he became the legal sovereign ruler of India.
- Issued purely Arabic coinage of silver *tanka* (first to do so) weighing 175 grams, which remains the basis of the modern rupee and copper *Jital.*

![](_page_6_Picture_4.jpeg)

#### **Silver Tanka of Ilutmish**

– Father of tomb building (Sultangarhi in Delhi); completed the construction of the Qutab Minar at Delhi, the tallest stone tower in India (238 ft.).

- Patronised Minhas-us-siraj (contemporary historian) who wrote *Tahaqqat-i-Nasuri.*
- Since he did not consider any of his sons worthy of the throne, he declared his daughter Razia as successor, deviating from normal practice. The nomination of a woman in preference to sons was a novel step.

Ruknuddin Firuz Shah (c.1236 CE)

- Eldest son of Iltutmish who was put on the throne by nobles.
- Took rides on elephants in Delhi distributing gold and the government was handled by Shah Turkan (originally Turkish Maid).
- When the governor of Multan revolted, Ruknuddin marched to suppress that revolt. Using this opportunity, Raziya, with the support of amirs of Delhi, seized the throne of the Delhi Sultanate. Both Firuz Shah and Shah Turkan were put to death.

### Razia Sultan (c.1236–1239 CE)

- First and only female Muslim ruler of medieval India.
- Discarded female apparel and *purdah*; she held court with her face unveiled. She began to adorn herself in male attire and rode out in public on an elephant, went for hunting, and led the army. This aroused resentment among the Turkish nobles.
- Her attempts to create a counter nobility of non-Turks invited the wrath of the Turkish *amirs*. They were particularly incensed over her decision to appoint an Abyssinian slave, Malik Jamaluddin Yaqut, to important office of the *Amir-i-akhur* (Superintendent of royal horses). The recruitment of a few other non-Turks to important posts further inflamed matters. The nobility realised that, though a woman, Raziya was not willing to be a puppet in their hands, therefore the nobles started revolting against her in the provinces. The governor of Lahore was first to create trouble but was defeated.

– In c.1240 CE, a serious rebellion broke out in Sirhind (Bhatinda) under Altuniya (governor). Raziya, alongside Yaqut, marched against Altuniya, but on the way Turkish followers of Altuniya murdered Yaqut and imprisoned Raziya. In the meantime, the Turkish nobles put Bahram, another son of Iltutmish, on the throne. However, Raziya won over her captor, Altuniya, and after marrying him proceeded to Delhi. But she was defeated and killed on the way by Bahram Shah.

Bahram Shah (c.1240–42 CE)

– The fall of Raziya paved the way for the ascendancy of 'the Forty'. In the next few years there ensued a struggle for supremacy between the Sultans and the nobles. Initially, the nobles helped Bahram to ascend the throne but gradually these nobles became disordered and constantly bickered among each other. It was during this period of unrest that he was murdered by his own army in c.1242 CE.

### Alauddin Masud Shah (c.1242–46 CE)

- Son of Ruknuddin Firuz Shah and nephew of Raziya Sultan. After his predecessor Bahram, was murdered by the army, the chiefs chose him to become the next ruler.
- However, he was more of a puppet for the chiefs, was considered incompetent and worthless and did not actually have much power or influence in the government. Instead, he became infamous for his fondness for entertainment and wine.
- By c.1246 CE, the chiefs became upset with his increasing hunger for more power in the government, and replaced him with Nasiruddin Mahmud.

Nasiruddin Mahmud (c.1246–65 CE)

– Grandson of Iltutmish who was inexperienced and young and had ascended to the throne with the aid of Ulugh Khan/Balban (member of the *Chahalgani*), who himself assumed the position of Naib (deputy or regent). To further strengthen his position, he married his daughter to

Nasiruddin. The real power during Mahmud reign lay in the hands of Balban.

- The growing authority of Balban alienated many of the Turkish chiefs and with a conspiracy in c.1250 CE, they ousted Balban from his position and replaced him with Imaduddin Raihan, who was an Indian Muslim, as they could not agree among themselves which Turkish noble should succeed Balban's post. Balban agreed to step aside but carefully build his own group, and within a short span of one and a half years, won over some of his opponents. In due course of time, Balban was reinstated with even more powers and he even assumed the royal insignia, the chhatr.
- Mahmud died in c.1265 CE. and according to some historians such as Ibn Battuta and Isami, Balban poisoned his master Nasiruddin and ascended the throne.

Balban (c.1266–1286 CE)

- Balban was undoubtedly one of the main architects of the Delhi Sultanate, particularly of its form of government and institutions. He asserted and enhanced the power of the monarchy. According to Balban, the Sultan was God's shadow on earth (*Zil-i-Ilahi*) and the recipient of divine grace (*Nibyabat-i-Khudai*). He ruled in an autocratic manner and worked hard to elevate the position of the Sultan.
- Balban's experience as the regent made him understand the problems of Delhi Sultanate. He knew that the real threat to the monarchy was from the nobles called the Forty. He was convinced that only by enhancing the power and authority of the monarchy he could solve this problem. He got every member of Iltutmish's family killed and gave a deadly blow to *Chahalgani*.
- Balban introduced rigorous court discipline and new customs such as *sijada* (prostration) and *paibos* (kissing the Sultan's feet) to prove his superiority over the nobles. In order to impress the people with the strength and awe of his

government, Balban maintained a magnificent court and also introduced the Persian festival of *Nauroz.* He refused to laugh and joke in the court, and even gave up drinking wine so that no one may see him in a non-serious mood.

- He spared only the most obedient nobles and eliminated all others by fair or foul means. Haybat Khan, the governor of Oudh, was punished for killing a man who was drunk. Sher Khan, the governor of Bhatinda, was poisoned.
- He was deeply racist and excluded non-Turks from administration. He stood forth as the champion of Turkish nobility. Indian Muslims were not given important posts in the government. He appointed spies to monitor the activities of the nobles.
- When Balban became the Sultan, his position was not secure. Many Turkish chiefs were hostile to him; the Mongols were looking forward for an opportunity to attack the Sultanate; the governors of the distant provinces were trying to become independent rulers while Indian rulers were also ready to revolt at the smallest opportunity. The law and order situation in the area around Delhi and in the Doab region had deteriorated. In the Ganga–Yamuna doab and Awadh, the roads were infested with the robbers and dacoits, because of which the communication with the eastern areas had become difficult. Some of the Rajput zamindars had set up forts in the area, and defied the government. The Mewatis had become so bold as to plunder people up to the outskirts of Delhi.
- To deal with these elements, Balban adopted a stern policy. He organised a strong centralised army, both to deal with internal disturbances, and to repel the Mongols who had entrenched themselves in the Punjab and posed a serious threat to the Delhi Sultanate.
- He separated the *Diwan-i-unzarat* (Finance Department) from the *Diwan-i-Arz* (Military Department). He reorganised the Diwan-i-arz and deployed the army in different parts of the country to put down rebellion. The

disturbances in Mewat, Doab, Awadh, and Katihar were ruthlessly suppressed. Balban also secured control over Ajmer and Nagaur in eastern Rajputana, but his attempts to capture Ranthambore and Gwalior failed. Instead of expanding his kingdom, Balban paid more attention to the restoration of law and order. Balban took severe action against the Mewatis and prevented such robberies. Robbers were mercilessly pursued and put to death. As a result, the roads became safe for travel.

- In c.1279 CE, encouraged by the Mongol threats and the old age of the Sultan, the governor of Bengal, Tughril Beg, revolted, assumed the title of Sultan and had the khutba read in his name. Balban sent his forces to Bengal and had Tughril beheaded. Subsequently he appointed his own son Bughra Khan as the governor of Bengal. By all these harsh methods, Balban controlled the situation. He called himself *Nasir- amir-ul-momin* (Caliph's right hand man) and instructed the ulemas to confine themselves to religious affairs and not to interfere in political activities.
- He administered justice with extreme impartiality. For instance, Malik Baqbaq, the governor of Badaun, was publicly flogged for his cruelty towards his servants.
- Followed the policy of Blood and Iron. Developed an efficient spy system and kept himself well-informed by appointing spies in every department.
- Strengthened frontiers against the Mongols but even he could not fully defend northern India against the attacks of the Mongols. Moreover, by excluding the non-Turkish from positions of power and authority and by trusting only a very narrow racial group, he made many people dissatisfied.
- Patron of men of letters and showered special favours on Amir Khusrau.
- However, in the north-west, the Mongols reappeared and Balban sent his son, Prince Mahmud, against them. But the prince (Khan-i-Shahid) was killed in the battle and his

death was a smashing blow to Balban. He died in c.1287 CE.

#### Kaiqubad (c.1287–90 CE)

– Grandson of Balban, who was raised to the throne by nobles after Balban's death. However, he was soon replaced by his son, Kaimurs, who remained on the throne for a little over three months. In c.1290 CE, Firoz, the *Ariz-i-Mumalik*, i.e., the Minister of War who later took the title of Jalaluddin Khalji, took a bold step by murdering Kaimurs and seized the throne. A group of Khalji nobles led by him established the Khalji dynasty. Some scholars call this event as the 'dynastic revolution' of c.1290 CE, as it brought to an end the so-called slave dynasty and bought to the forefront the Khaljis.

![](_page_12_Picture_3.jpeg)

# KHALJI DYNASTY (C. 1290- 1320 CE)

#### Jalauddin Khalji (c.1290–1296 CE)

- Jalaluddin Khalji (Firoz) laid the foundation of the Khalji dynasty. He was seventy years old when he came to power and ruled only for a short span of six years. During Balban's reign, Jalaluddin had been the warden of the marches in north-west and had fought many successful battles against the Mongols.
- Repelled the attack of the Mongols under Abdullah and the Mongols who settled near Delhi were called the '*New Musalmans*'.
- He was generous and also the first sultan of the Delhi Sultanate to have a benevolent attitude towards Hindus. He clearly put forward the view that the state should be based on the willing support of the governed, and that since the large majority of the people in India were Hindus, the state

in India could not be a truly Islamic state.

- He avoided harsh punishments, even to those who revolted against him. He not only forgave them but at times even rewarded them to win their support. However, his leniency was misunderstood as weakness by many people, including his supporters. When the *thugs* (robbers) looted the country, they were allowed to go after only a mere severe warning.
- Jalaluddin tried to win the goodwill of the nobility by adopting policy of tolerance. He retained the earlier nobility in his administration. For instance, Malik Chhajju, nephew of Balban, was allowed to remain the governor of Kara. When Chhajju revolted, it was suppressed, but he was pardoned. In c.1292 CE, when Malik Chhajju revolted for the second time, he was replaced by his nephew and son-in-law, Alauddin Khalji.
- Married his daughter to Ulugh Khan, a descendant of Chengiz Khan (to win the Mongols' goodwill).
- During his reign in c.1294 CE, Devagiri was invaded by Alauddin Khalji (Ali Gurshap) during the reception there in July c. 1296 CE, Alauddin Khalji treacherously murdered his father-in-law Jalaluddin Khalji near Kara and usurped the throne of Delhi. He proclaimed himself Sultan by winning over the nobles and soldiers to his side by lavish use of gold (accumulated from Devagiri).

![](_page_14_Picture_0.jpeg)

Alauddin Khalji (c.1296–1316 CE)

– Alauddin Khalji was Jalaluddin's ambitious nephew and son-in-law. He had helped his uncle in his struggle for power and was appointed as *Amir-i-Tuzuk* (Master of Ceremonies). He had two victorious expeditions during the reign of Jalaluddin. After the first expedition of Bhilsa (Vidisa) in c. 1292 CE, he was given the iqta of Awadh, in addition to that of Kara. He was also appointed *Arizi-i-Mumalik* (Minister of War). In c.1294 CE, he led the first

Turkish expedition to southern India and plundered Devagiri. The successful expedition proved that Alauddin was an able military commander and efficient organiser.

- Jalaluddin's policy of tolerance was reversed by Alauddin Khalji, who awarded drastic punishments to all those who dared to oppose him. He decided to revive Balban's policies of ruthless governance. He slaughtered the New Musalmans, and the old Balbani and Jalali nobles. He decided to curb the powers of the nobles and the interference of the *ulema* in the matters of the state. According to Barani, the author of *Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi*, Alauddin was convinced that the general prosperity of the nobles, inter-marriages between noble families, inefficient spy-system, and drinking liquor, were the basic reasons for the rebellions. Therefore, he passed four ordinances.
  - He confiscated the properties of the nobles.
  - The intelligence system was reorganised and all the secret activities of the nobles were immediately reported to the Sultan.
  - The use of liquor and intoxicants was prohibited.
  - Social gatherings and festivities without the permission of Sultan were forbidden. By such harsh measures, his reign was free from rebellions.
- Alauddin established a huge permanent standing army to satisfy his ambition of conquest and to protect the country from Mongol invasion. Alauddin Khalji sent his army six times against the Mongols. The first two was successful. But the third Mongol invader, Khwaja, came up to Delhi. However, he was prevented from entering into the capital city. The next three Mongol invasions were also dealt with severely. Thousands of Mongols were killed. The northwestern frontier was fortified and Ghazi Malik (Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq) was appointed to as the Warden of Marches to protect the frontier.
- The military conquests of Alauddin Khalji include his expedition against Gujarat, Rajputana, and the Deccan.

![](_page_16_Figure_0.jpeg)

– Conquest of Gujarat: Alauddin first began his territorial conquest with a campaign against Gujarat in c. 1299 CE, which was ruled by the Vaghela king Rai Karan. The vast riches of Gujarat allured him first and foremost, and furthermore, it was also a strategic decision since the Gujarat wealth could pay for his future conquests while her seaports could ensure a regular supply of Arab horses for his army. An army under two of Alauddin's noted generals, Ulugh Khan and Nusarat Khan, marched against Gujarat. Rai Karan, the ruler of Gujarat fled, and the temple of

Somnath was captured along with destroying it. An enormous booty was collected. Even the wealthy Muslim merchants were not spared. Alauddin married the Raja's wife Kamla Bai and acquired Malik Kafur (an eunuch and great military general who later led the Khalji dynasty invasions to South India).

- Conquest of Rajputana: After the annexation of Gujarat, Alauddin turned his attention towards Rajputana.
  - Ranthambore: It was reputed to be the strongest fort of Rajasthan and had earlier defied Jalaluddin Khalji. The capture of Ranthambore was necessary to break the power and morale of the Rajputs. Hence, it was his first target. The immediate cause of attack was that the ruler of Ranthambore, Hamirdeva, gave shelter to two rebellious Mongol soldiers and refused to hand over them to the Khalji ruler. Hence an offensive was launched against Ranthambore. To begin with, the Khalji forces suffered losses. Nusrat Khan even lost his life. Finally, Alauddin himself had to come on the battlefield. However, in c. 1301 CE, the fort fell to Alauddin. Women committed jauhar or self-immolation (described by Amir Khusrau).
  - Chittor: In c. 1303 CE, Alauddin besieged Chittor, another powerful state of Rajputana. According to some scholars, Alauddin attacked Chittor because he coveted Padmini, the beautiful queen of Raja Ratan Singh. The Rajput women including Rani Padmini performed jauhar. This Padmini episode was graphically mentioned in the book *Padmavath*, written by Jayasi. According to Amir Khusrau, the Sultan ordered a general massacre of the civil population. Chittor was renamed Khizrabad after the name of Sultan's son Khizr Khan. Alauddin, however, had to return back quickly to Delhi as the Mongol army was advancing towards Delhi.

Malwa and others: In c. 1305 CE, the Khalji army under Ain-ul- Mulk captured Malwa. Other states such as Ujjain, Mandu, Dhar, and Chanderi were also captured. After the conquest of Malwa, Alauddin sent Malik Kafur to the South and himself attacked Siwana. The ruler of Siwana, Raja Shital Deva, defended the fort bravely but was ultimately defeated. In c. 1311 CE, another Rajput kingdom, Jalore, was also captured. Thus by c. 1311 CE, Alauddin had completed the conquest of large parts of Rajputana and became the master of North India.

•

- Conquest of Deccan and South India: This region was ruled by four important dynasties – *Yadavas of Devagiri*, *Kakatiyas of Warangal*, *Hoysalas of Dwarasamudra*, and the *Pandyas of Madurai*. The expeditions to the south were sent under Malik Kafur, a trusted commander of Alauddin who held the office of the Naib.
  - His first target was Rai Karan (the earlier rule of Gujarat), who had now occupied Baglana, and defeated him.
  - The second expedition was against Rai Ramachandra, the ruler of Devagiri in c.1306–07 CE, who had earlier promised to pay tribute to Sultan but did not pay. Ramachandra surrendered after little resistance to Malik Kafur and was treated honourably. He was kept as a guest at Alauddin's court and was given a gift of one lakh tankas and the title of Rai Rayan. He was also given a district of Gujarat and one of his daughters was married to Alauddin. Alauddin showed generosity towards Ramachandra because he wanted to have Ramachandra as an ally for campaigns in the South.
  - In c.1309 CE, Malik Kafur launched his campaign against Warangal in the Telengana area. Its ruler Pratab Rudradeva was defeated and enormous booty was collected from him while he agreed to pay regular

tribute to the Sultan.

- Malik Kafur's next target was the Hoysala ruler Vira Ballala III in c.1310 CE. He was defeated and a vast quantity of booty was seized and sent to Delhi.
- Kafur next marched against the Pandyas in c.1311 CE. In the case of Pandyas, a direct decisive battle could not take place. Vira Pandya fled the capital Madurai and Kafur plundered as much as he could, including a number of wealthy temples such as that of Chidambaram. According to Amir Khusrau, Malik Kafur reached as far as Rameshwaram and built a mosque there and returned to Delhi with 512 elephants, 7000 horses, and 500 mans of precious stone. The Sultan honoured Malik Kafur by appointing him Naib Malik of the empire. Alauddin's forces under Malik Kafur continued to maintain a control over the Deccan kingdoms. Alauddin died in c.1316 CE.
- Although the Sultan was illiterate, he patronised poets like Amir Khusrau and Mir Hasan Dehlvi. He also built a famous gateway known as Alai Darwaza*,* Hauz Khas, Mahal Hazaar Satoon, Jamait Khana Mosque, Alai Minar, and constructed a new capital at Siri.
- Alauddin adopted the title of *Sikander-i-Azam* and gave Amir Khusrau the title of *Tuti-i-Hind* (Parrot of India).
- Included non-Turks in his service.
- First ruler to fix land revenue in cash.
- His theory of kinship was secular and he proclaimed "*Kingship knows no Kinship*" and "I do not know if this is lawful or unlawful, I do whatever I think to be good for the state."
- Refuted the suzerainty of the Caliph and did not allow any power independent of the state to guide his policy. According to Barni, Alauddin wanted to join a new religion.

Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah (c.1316–1320 CE)

- Following the death of Alauddin, the Delhi Sultanate was plunged into confusion. Malik Kafur sat on the throne for a few days, only to be deposed by Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah (one of the sons of Alauddin, who escaped the preying eyes of Malik Kafur).
- Declared himself Caliph and took title of *Al Wasiq Billah*.
- Cancelled all harsh regulations of his father.
- Although able to crush many revolts of his reign, he was not able to run the administration smoothly. For instance, during this period, rebellions broke out in Devagiri (Deogir) but were harshly suppressed.
- Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah was soon murdered and Khusrau ascended the throne.

Nasiruddin Khusrau Shah (c.1320 CE)

- Killed Mubarak Shah; however, did not last long on the throne as some dissatisfied officers, led by Ghazi Malik, the governor of Dipalpur, killed Khusru Shah and ascended the throne of Delhi under the title of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq in c.1320 CE.
- Only Hindu convert to sit on the throne of Delhi.

Thus, only four years after the death of Alauddin, the Khalji dynasty came to end and power passed into the hands of the Tughlaqs.

# **Administration of Alauddin Khalji**

- a. Military Reforms: Alauddin was the first Sultan to have a large permanent standing army and paid them in cash from the royal treasury. He imported horses and according to historian Ferishta, he recruited 4,75,000 cavalrymen. An innovative *Chehra and Dagh System* was introduced by him wherein the *Chehra* (detailed description of each soldier) and *Dagh* (branding of horses) was maintained. In order to ensure maximum efficiency, a strict review of the army from time to time was carried out.
- b. Market Reforms: Alauddin's measures to control the markets

and price regulations were one of the most important policy initiatives of his reign and he is noted in history for the same. Since Alauddin wanted to maintain a large army, he therefore lowered and fixed the price of the commodities of daily use. Alauddin Khalji established four separate markets in Delhi,

- i. Grain market (*Mandi*) for grain.
- ii. Cloth and groceries market (*Sarai Adl*) for cloth, sugar, dried fruits, butter, and oil.
- iii. Market for horses, slaves, cattle, etc.
- iv. Market for miscellaneous commodities.

To ensure implementation, each market was under the control of a superintendent called *Shahna-i- Mandi* who was assisted by an intelligence officer. Apart from Shahna-i-Mandi, Alauddin received daily reports of the market from two other independent sources, *barids* (intelligence officer) and *munhiyans* (secret spies). The Sultan also sent slave boys to buy various commodities to check prices. Any violation of the Sultan's orders (such as if any shop keeper charged a higher price, or tried to cheat by using false weights and measures) resulted in harsh punishment, including expulsion from the capital, imposition of fine, imprisonment, and mutilation. No hoarding was allowed and even during the famine the same price was maintained.

The supply of grain was ensured by holding stocks in government store houses. Regulations were issued to fix the price of all commodities. A separate department called *Diwani Riyasat* was created under an officer called *Naib-i-Riyasat*. Every merchant was registered under the Market Department. The sale of liquor and intoxicants was prohibited and gambling too was banned.

c. Land Revenue Administration: Alauddin Khalji was the first Sultan of Delhi who ordered for the measurement of land. Even the big landlords could not escape from paying land tax. Land revenue was collected in cash in order to enable the Sultan to pay the soldiers in cash. The state officials measured the cultivated land and fixed land revenue accordingly. *Biswa* was the standard unit of measurement. State demand was one fifth of the produce and along with it house tax (*Grahi*) and pasture

tax (*Chari*) were imposed, but *Kismat-i-Khuti* (Headman's cess) was abolished. His land revenue reforms provided a basis for the future reforms of Sher Shah and Akbar. He centralised administration and even confiscated religious endowments and free lands (*Inam and Wakt*).

# TUGHLAQ DYNASTY (C.1320–1414 CE)/DYNASTY OF QARAUNAH TURKS

The Tughlaqs were also known as the *Quaraunah Turks* as the father of Ghazi Malik was a Qaraunah Turk in origin.

![](_page_23_Figure_0.jpeg)

Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq (c.1320–25 CE)

- Founder of the Tughlaq dynasty and the first Sultan to take the title of *Ghazi*/ Slayer of Infidels.
- First sultan to start irrigation works.
- Built a strong fort called Tughlaqabad near Delhi.
- Dispatched his son, Jauna Khan /Mohammad Bin Tughlaq, to re-establish authority in Warangal (Kakatiyas) and Madurai (Pandayas).
- Had a troublesome relationship with the Sufi saint, Sheikh Nizamuddin Aulia.
- Died due to the collapse of a wooden structure; some scholars like Ibn Batuta believe that his death was an act of

sabotage orchestrated by his son Jauna Khan.

Mohammad Bin Tughlaq/ Jauna Khan (c.1325–51 CE)

- He is considered an ill-fated idealist owing to his ambitious schemes and novel experiments, which ended in miserable failures because they were all far ahead of their time.
- Ziauddin Barni mentions his five experiments / campaigns:
  - i. Transferred his capital from Delhi to Devagiri (Daulatabad) to have better administration, and forcibly moved the entire population to the new capital. But the capital shifted back to Delhi after two years because of the lack of water supply in Daulatabad. The distance between these two places was more than 1500 kilometres and many people died during the rigorous journey in the summer.

#### **Daultabad Fort**

ii. After repulsing an attack of Mongols, he planned to occupy Khurasan and Iraq. For this, he organised a huge army, but as conditions improved in Iraq, he abandoned the plan and disbanded the army (paid the

extra army for one full year).

- iii. In order to overcome financial difficulties, Muhammad bin Tughlaq increased the land revenue (half the produce) on the farmers of Doab (land between Ganges and Yamuna rivers). It was an excessive and arbitrary step on the farmers. This measure proved to be illtimed as the Doab was passing through famine, followed by plague.
- iv. Idea of token currency (using copper coins) modelled on the basis of Chinese example (Kublai Khan issued paper money in China). Tughlaq thus issued copper coins at par with the value of the silver tanka coins. Very few people exchanged gold/silver for copper and the tokens were easy to forge, which lead to heavy losses. Later on, he repealed his verdict, and all coins were redeemed in silver/gold, making the treasury empty.
- v. His Qarachill expedition (Kumaon Hills) met with several setbacks.
- He was the only Delhi Sultan who had received a comprehensive literary, religious, and philosophical education. He knew Arabic and Persian languages, was an expert in philosophy, astronomy, logic, and mathematics, and was also a good calligrapher.
- He was very tolerant in religious matters. He maintained diplomatic relations with far off countries like Egypt, China, and Iran. During his reign, the famous traveller Ibn Batuta (author of *Safarnama Rehla*) came to India in c.1334 CE and acted as a *Qazi* at Delhi for eight years.
- Set up a new department of Agriculture, *Diwan-i-amirkohi.* He launched a scheme by which *takkavi* loans (loans for cultivation) were given to the farmers to buy seed and to extend cultivation. A model farm under the state was created in an area of 64 square miles, for which the government spent seventy lakh tankas. This experiment

was further continued by Firoz Tughlaq.

- Built the fort of Adilabad and the city of Jahanpanah.
- During his last days, the whole of South India became independent and three major states emerged:
  - Vijaynagar kingdom – Harihara and Bukka (c.1336 CE)
  - Bahmani Kingdom (Deccan) – Hasan Gangu (c.1347 CE)
  - Sultanate of Madurai: The rebellion of Hasan Shah resulted in the establishment of the Madurai Sultanate.
- Along with Southern states, the governors of Oudh, Multan, and Sindh revolted against the authority of Muhammad bin Tughlaq. In Gujarat, Taghi rose in revolt against the Sultan who spent nearly three years in chasing him.
- Muhammad bin Tughlaq's health became worse and he died in c.1351 CE. According to Baduani, *the Sultan was freed from his people and the people from the Sultan*. According to Barani, Muhammad bin Tughlaq was a mixture of opposites. His reign marked the beginning of the process of its decline.

Firoz Shah Tughlaq (c.1351–1388 CE)

- He had the *unique* distinction of being chosen as Sultan by the nobles. So, his policy aimed to appease the nobles, the army, and theologicians.
- He appointed *Khan-i-Jahan* Maqbal, a Telugu Brahmin convert, as *Wazir* (prime minister). The Wazir helped the Sultan in his administration and maintained the prestige of the Sultanate during this period.
- After his accession, Firoz had to face the problem of preventing the disintegration of the Delhi Sultanate. Instead of reasserting his authority over the Deccan and south India, he tried to safeguard his authority over north India. He led two unsuccessful campaigns to Bengal, which, as a result, became free from the control of Delhi Sultanate.
- Firoz led a campaign against Jajnagar (modern Orissa). He

returned with rich booty acquired from temples such as the Puri Jagannath temple. He marched against Nagarkot and made its ruler pay him tributes. During this campaign, the Sultan collected 1300 Sanskrit manuscripts from the Jawalamukhi temple library and got them translated into Persian by Arizuddin Khan 'Dalail-i-Firuz Shahi'. Firoz next marched against Thatta in the Sindh region and crushed a rebellion there.

- He strictly followed the advice of the *ulemas* in running the administration. As per the Islamic law, he levied the taxes. *Jaziya* was strictly imposed on non-Muslims. He treated Hindus as second grade citizens and adopted a very harsh attitude towards them (for instance a Brahmin was burnt publicly for questioning the Quran). In this respect, he was the precursor of Sikandar Lodhi and Aurangazeb. The special tax on 28 items was abolished by him since they were against Islamic law. He also prohibited Muslim women from going to worship at the grave of saints and also persecuted a number of heretical Muslim sects (Shia Muslims and Sufis).
- Had great regard for Caliph of Egypt and styled himself as his deputy and twice received robes of honour from him.
- He not only revived the *Iqtadari* system was but also made it hereditary. Soldiers were given land assignments (jagir system), and even their recruitment was made hereditary.
- He was the first Sultan to impose *Sharb (*irrigation tax). But at the same time, he built number of canals and also set up a separate department of public works.
  - Sirsa to Hansi
  - Sutlej to Hansi: Longest canal (about 200 kilometres)
  - Yamuna to Hissar
- During his reign there were about 1200 fruit gardens in and around Delhi yielding good revenue:
  - *Kharaj* – 10% of produce
  - *Zakat* – alms for Muslims
  - *Khams* – 20% spoils of war

- Introduced 2 new coins: *Adha* (50% Jital) and *Bitch* (23% Jital)
- He also developed royal factories called *karkhanas* in which thousands of slaves were employed, organised under the *Diwan-i-Bandagan* (department of slaves). The officerin-charge was the *Wakil-i-dar*. He increased the number of slaves by capturing the defeated soldiers and young persons.
- About 300 new towns were built during his reign. The famous among them was Firozabad near Red Fort in Delhi, now called Firoz Shah Kotla, Hisar, Jaunpur (considered the Shiraz of the east).

#### **Tomb of Firuz Shah Tughlaq,Hauz khas**

– Old monuments like the Jama Masjid and the Qutab Minar (which was struck by lightning, and the fourth storey was subsequently replaced by two smaller ones) were repaired.

Ashokan pillars from Topara and Meerut were brought to Delhi.

- A new department called *Diwan-i-Khairat* (Department of Charity) was created to take care of orphans and widows. Free hospitals like *Dar-ul- Shafa* and marriage bureaus for poor Muslims were also established.
- Firoz patronised scholars like Barani (famous historian who wrote *Tarikh-i-Firoz Shah* and *Futwa-i-Jahandari*) and Khwajja Abdul Malik Islami (who wrote *Futah-Us-Sulatin*). He himself wrote the *Futuhat-e-firozshahi.*
- When Firoz Shah Tughlaz died in c.1388 CE, the struggle for power between the Sultan and the nobles started once again. His successors had to face the rebellion of the slaves created by Firoz.

Muhammad Khan

Ghiyaddin Tughlaq Shah II

Abu Bakr Shah

Nasiruddin Muhammad (c.1390–1398 CE)

- In the following years, the Delhi Sultanate had disintegrated further. Many provinces like Malwa and Gujarat declared their independence.
- Timur (Mongol leader of Central Asia, head of Chaghtai Turks, whose vast kingdom stretched from lower Volga to river Indus, incorporating modern Turkey, Iran, Transoxiana, Afghanistan, parts of Punjab, and who had already conquered Mesopotamia and Afghanistan) invaded India in c.1398 CE, which further worsened the situation.
- When Timur entered Delhi, there was no opposition and he sacked Delhi for three days murdering thousands of people and looting enormous wealth. He withdrew from India in c.1399 and his invasion delivered a death blow to the Tughlaq dynasty.

Daulat Khan

– Defeated by Khizr Khan who founded the Saiyyad Dynasty.

# SAIYYAD DYNASTY (C. 1414- 51) CE

#### Khizr Khan (c.1414–21 CE)

- Before his departure from India, Timur appointed Khizr Khan as the governor of Multan. He captured Delhi and founded the Sayyid dynasty in c.1414 CE. However, he did not assume the title of Sultan but was comfortable with *Rayat- i-Ala*. Coins were struck and khutba was read in name of Timur, and after his death, in the name of his successor Shahrukh.
- Khizr Khan was the most competent Sayyid ruler. He tried to consolidate the Delhi Sultanate but could not do much and died in c.1421 CE.

Mubarak Shah (c.1421–33 CE)

– Khizr Khan was succeeded by his son, Mubarak Shah.

Muhammad Shah (c.1434–43 CE)

- He was always busy acting against conspirators and gradually lost control over his nobles.
- All of these rulers tried to control rebellious regions like Katehar, Badaun, Etawah, Patiali, Gwalior, Kampil, Nagaur, and Mewat, but they failed due to the conspiracy of the nobles.
- Muhammad Shah died in 1445 and was succeeded by his son Alam Shah.

Alauddin Alam Shah (c.1443–51 CE)

- He proved to be an incompetent Sultan and the weakest of the Sayyid princes.
- Alam Shah's Wazir, Hamid Khan, invited Bahlol Lodhi to take charge of the army and after realising that it would be

difficult to continue as Sultan, Alam Shah left for Badaun.

# LODHI DYNASTY (C. 1451- 1526 CE)

The Lodhis were the last ruling family of the Sultanate period and the first to be headed by the Afghans who were ruling over Sirhind when the Sayyids were in India.

![](_page_31_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Lodi Dynasty Map**

#### Bahlol Lodhi (c.1451–89 CE)

- With the help of a few nobles, Bahlol Lodhi took charge of the army, and became the Sultan. Thus, he laid the foundation of Lodhi dynasty.
- Sultan Bahlol Lodhi was a capable general and was well aware of the fact that to establish his control over Sultanate, he would require help and support of Afghan nobles. The Afghan nobles wanted Sultan to treat them as an equal partner rather than an absolute monarch. To placate them, Bahlol publicly declared that he considered himself one of the Afghan peers and not the king. He did not sit on the throne, nor did he insist on his nobles standing in his court. This policy worked well throughout his long reign and he did not face any trouble from his powerful Afghan nobles.
- He successfully suppressed the revolts in Mewat and Doab. In c.1476 CE, he defeated the Sultan of Jaunpur and annexed it to Delhi Sultanate. He also brought the ruler of Kalpi and Dholpur under the suzerainty of Delhi. He annexed Sharqui dynasty and introduced Bahlol copper coins. However, he failed to re- occupy Bengal, Gujarat, and the Deccan.

Sikander Lodhi (c.1489–1517 CE)

- He was the greatest and noblest of the three Lodhi rulers.
- His mother was a Hindu and his real name was Nizam Khan.
- He brought the whole of Bihar under his control, and defeated many Rajput chiefs. He attacked Bengal and forced its ruler to conclude a treaty with him, and extended his empire from the Punjab to Bihar including Dholpur, Narwar, and some parts of the kingdom of Gwalior and Nagor.
- He was a good administrator. Roads were laid and many irrigational facilities were provided for the benefit of the peasantry. He laid great emphasis on justice. During his reign, prices of commodities were very cheap.

- Introduced a new measurement yardstick, the *Gazz-i-Sikandari*, and a system of auditing of accounts.
- Despite certain laudable qualities, he was a bigot and showed little tolerance towards the non-Muslims. He destroyed many Hindu temples and imposed many restrictions on the Hindus. He re-imposed *jaziya* on non-Muslims.
- He believed in the superior position of the Sultan vis-a-vis the nobles. He compelled nobles and amirs to show formal respect to the Sultan in darbar and outside and treated them harshly.
- Founded Agra in c.1504 CE and wrote Persian verses under the name 'Gulrakhi'.

Ibrahim Lodhi (c.1517–1526 CE)

– Eldest son of Sikander Lodhi, who was not only arrogant but a repressive ruler too.

He was defeated by Rana Sanga of Mewar

- He openly insulted and humiliated his nobles in court and put to death those nobles who revolted against him. Disaffection between king and courtiers became very common during his reign. His own uncle, Alauddin, revolted. Daulat Khan Lodhi, the governor of the Punjab, greatly displeased by the arrogance and insult of Ibrahim, invited Babur to invade India.
- Babur marched against Delhi and defeated and killed Ibrahim Lodhi in the first Battle of Panipat (c.1526 CE). The Afghan kingdom thus lasted for only seventy-five years. With him, the Sultanate period ended, and as a scholar states "The Sultanate of Delhi, which had its birth on the battlefield of Tarain in c. 1192 CE, breathed its last in c. 1526 CE, a few miles away on the battlefield of Panipat."

ADMINISTRATION UNDER

# SULTANATE PERIOD

The establishment and expansion of the Delhi Sultanate led to the evolution of a powerful and efficient administrative system. At its zenith, the Delhi Sultanate controlled almost the entire country as far south as Madurai. Even after its disintegration, the Delhi Sultanate and its administrative system made a powerful impact on the Indian provincial kingdoms, and later on the Mughal system of administration.

# **The Sultan**

The title of 'Sultan' was started by Turkish rulers and Mahmud of Ghazni was the first to assume the title of Sultan. The Delhi Sultanate was an Islamic state with its religion as Islam. The Sultans considered themselves as representatives of the Caliph. They included the name of the Caliph in the *khutba* or prayer and inscribed it on their coins. This practice was even continued by Balban, who called himself the shadow of God. Iltutmish, Muhammad bin Tughlaq, and Firoz Tughlaq obtained *mansur* (letter of investiture) from the Caliph. The office of the Sultan was the most important in the Sultanate and he was the ultimate authority for the military, legal, and political matters. The dispensation of justice was another important function performed by the Sultan and he acted as a court of appeal. For instance, Balban dispensed justice with extreme impartiality, not sparing even the high officers of state. Muhammad bin Tughlaq even gave harsh punishments to *ulemas*, who were previously exempted.

There was no clear law of succession during this period. All the sons had equal claim to the throne. Interestingly, the idea of primogeniture was fully acceptable neither to the Muslims nor to the Hindus. Iltutmish even nominated his daughter in preference to his sons. But such nominations or successions were to be mostly accepted by the nobles. Sometimes, ulemas also played crucial role in getting a favourable public opinion. However, military superiority remained the main factor in matters of succession.

![](_page_35_Picture_0.jpeg)

## **Central Administration**

The Sultan was assisted by a number of ministers who headed different departments and aided in administration. These ministers were chosen by Sultan and they remained in office at his pleasure. The post of *Naib* was the most powerful one. The Naib practically enjoyed all the powers of the Sultan and exercised general control over all the departments. Next to him, was the *Wazir*, who headed the finance department called *Diwan-i-Wizarat.* A separate Auditor General for scrutinising expenditure and an accountant general for inspecting income worked under the Wazir. The period of Wazir-ship of Firuz Tughlaq Khan -i-Jahan is generally considered as the high watermark period of the Wazir's influence.

The military department was called *Diwan-i-Arz*. It was headed by the *Ariz-i-mumalik* who was responsible for recruiting the soldiers and administering the military department. It should be noted that the Ariz was not the commander-in-chief of the army, since the Sultan himself was the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The military department was first set up by Balban and was further improved by Alauddin Khalji, who insisted on a regular muster of the armed forces. Alauddin introduced the Chehra and Dagh system, so that along with a descriptive roll of each soldier, a system of branding of the horses was also in place which would allow only good quality horses to be part of muster. He was also the first Sultan to pay his soldiers salary in cash. He also had the largest standing and efficient army of about three lakhs, which was definitely a main factor in containing the Mongol invasions along with his Deccan expansion. The Turks also maintained a large number of elephants properly trained for war purposes. However, there was predominance of the Cavalry which was considered more prestigious. At the time of Ghaznavids, Hindus were employed both in the infantry and cavalry but during the Sultanate period they were largely employed in the infantry.

*Diwan-i-Rasalat* was the department of religious affairs, which dealt with pious foundations and gave stipends to deserving scholars and man of piety. Grants were made by this department also for the construction

and maintenance of mosques, tombs, and madrasas. It was headed by chief *Sadr* who also functioned as Chief *Qazi*, as the head of the judicial department. Other judges or qazis were appointed in various parts of the Sultanate. Muslim personal law or *sharia* was followed in civil matters. The Hindus were governed by their own personal law and their cases were dispensed by the village panchayats. The criminal law was based on the rules and regulations made by the Sultans. The department of correspondence was called *Diwan-i-Insha.* All the correspondence between the ruler and the sovereigns of other states as well as with his subordinate officials was dealt with by this department.

### **Provincial government**

The provinces under the Delhi Sultanate were called *iqtas.* They were initially under the control of the nobles. But the governors of the provinces were called the *muqtis* or *walis.* They were to maintain law and order and collect the land revenue. The provinces were further divided into *shiqs,* which was under the control of the *shiqdar*, and the next division was *pargana*, comprising a number of villages and was headed by the *amil.* The villages were grouped into units of 100 or 84 (traditionally called *chaurasi*). The village remained the basic unit of the administration. The village headman was known as *muqaddam* or *chaudhri.* The village accountant was called *patwari.*

![](_page_37_Figure_0.jpeg)

After consolidating their position in India, the Delhi Sultans introduced reforms in the land revenue administration. The lands were classified into three categories:

- 1. *Iqta* land – Lands assigned to officials as iqtas instead of payment for their services.
- 2. *Khalisa* land – Land under the direct control of the Sultan and the revenues collected were spent for the maintenance of royal court and royal household.
- 3. *Inam* land – Land assigned or granted to religious leaders or religious institutions.

A class of *khuts* (smaller landlords) and Hindus *rais* (autonomous *rajas*) emerged, who not only enjoyed a higher standard of life but sometimes they misused their power and exploited the poor peasants. Stern actions taken against them by Alauddin Khalji. However, the general peasantry paid one third of their produce as land revenue, and sometimes even one

half of the produce. They also paid other taxes and always led a handto-mouth living. Frequent famines made their lives more miserable. However, Sultans like Muhammad bin Tughlaq and Firoz Tughlaq took efforts to enhance agricultural production by providing irrigational facilities and by providing *takkavi* loans. They also encouraged the farmers to cultivate superior crop like wheat instead of barley. Firoz encouraged the growth of horticulture. Muhammad bin Tughlaq created a separate agricultural department, *Diwan-i- Kohi.* The Sultan and his nobles took keen interest in improving the quality of fruits in India, especially melons and grapes. Ibn Batuta records in his texts that the soil was so fertile that it could produce two crops every year, rice being sown three times a year.

During the Sultanate period, the process of urbanisation gained momentum. A number of cities and towns had grown during this period. Lahore and Multan (in the north west), Broach, Cambay, and Anhilwara (in the west), Kara and Lakhnauti in the east, Daulatabad, Delhi, and Jaunpur were important among them. Delhi remained the largest city in the east. The growth of trade and commerce was described by contemporary writers. India exported a large number of commodities to the countries on the Persian Gulf and West Asia and also to South East Asian countries. Bengal (specially Sonargaon for muslin, i.e., fine cotton cloth) and the towns in Gujarat were famous for fine quality fabrics. Cambay in Gujarat was famous for textiles and for gold and silver work. India imported high grade textiles (satin, etc.), glassware, and horses from West Asia. From China, it imported raw silk and porcelain. Overseas trade was under the control of Multanis (mostly Hindus) and Khurasanis (Afghan Muslims). Inland trade was dominated by Gujarati, Marwari and Muslim Bohra merchants. The merchants were extremely wealthy and lived a luxurious life. The Gujarati and Marwari merchants were mostly Jains and they spent large sums for the construction of temples.

Construction of roads and their maintenance facilitated for smooth transport and communication. Particularly, the royal roads were kept in good shape. In addition to royal road from Peshawar to Sonargaon, Muhammad bin Tughlaq built road to Daulatabad. *Sarais* or rest houses

on the highways were maintained for the convenience of the travelers. There were also arrangements for posts to be carried very quickly from one part of the country to another with the help of relays of horses and runners who were posted every few kilometres.

Cotton textile and silk industry flourished in this period. Sericulture was introduced on a large scale, which made India less dependent on other countries for the import of raw silk. The paper industry had grown and there was an extensive use of paper from 14th and 15th centuries. Other crafts like leather-making, metal-crafts, and carpet-weaving flourished due to the increasing demand. The royal *karkhanas* supplied the goods needed to the Sultan and his household. They manufactured costly articles made of gold, silver and gold ware. The nobles also aped the lifestyle of the Sultans and indulged in luxurious living. They were well paid and accumulated enormous wealth.

The system of coinage had also developed during the Delhi Sultanate. Iltutmish issued several types of silver *tankas*. One silver tanka was divided into 48 jitals during the Khalji rule and 50 jitals during the Tughlaq rule. Gold coins or *dinar*s became popular during the reign of Alauddin Khalji after his South Indian conquests. Copper coins were less in number and dateless. Muhammad bin Tughlaq had not only experimented with token currency but also issued several types of gold and silver coins. They were minted at eight different places. At least twenty five varieties of gold coins were issued by him.

The Turks popularised a number of crafts and techniques such as:

- a. Use of iron stirrup
- b. Use of armour both for the horse and rider.
- c. Improvement of *rahat* (Persian wheel through which water could be lifted from a deeper level for irrigation)
- d. Paper-making, glass-making, the spinning wheel, and an improved loom for weaving.
- e. Use of superior mortar, which enabled the Turks to erect magnificent buildings based on the arch and dome.

# SOCIAL SYSTEM

There was little change in the structure of the Hindu society during this period. Traditional caste system with the Brahmins on the upper strata of the society was prevalent. The subservient position of women also continued and the practice of Sati was widely prevalent. Ibn Batuta had mentioned with horror the scene of a woman burning herself in the funeral pyre of her husband with great beating of drums. The Arabs and Turks brought the *purdah* system into India and the seclusion of women, and the wearing of purdah became widespread among the women in the upper Hindu classes of north India.

During the Sultanate period, the Muslim society remained divided into several ethnic and racial groups. The Turks, Iranians, Afghans, and Indian Muslims developed as exclusive groups and there were no intermarriages between them. Hindu converts from lower castes were also not given equal respect. The Muslim nobles occupied high offices and very rarely the Hindu nobles were given high position in the government. The Hindus were considered *zimmis* or protected people, for which they were forced to pay a tax called *jaziya.* In the beginning *jaziya* was collected as part of land tax. Firoz Tughlaq separated it from the land revenue and collected *jiziya* as a separate tax and levied it on Brahmans also.

Even though slavery had existed in India since ancient times, it flourished during the Sultanate period. There were slave markets for men and women and slaves were hired for varied jobs ranging from household chores to skilled professions. Firoz Shah Tughlaq had about 1,80,000 slaves.

# ART AND ARCHITECTURE

The art and architecture of the Delhi Sultanate period was distinct from the Indian style. The Turks introduced arches, domes, lofty towers, or minarets and decorations using the Arabic script. They used the skill of the Indian stone-cutters. They also added colour to their buildings by using marbles, red and yellow sand stones.

In the beginning, they converted a number of Hindu temples into

mosques. For instance, the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque near Qutub Minar in Delhi was formerly a Vishnu temple. But later, they began to construct new structures. Their policy towards temples and places of Hindu worship forbade new places of worship but allowed the repair of old temples. The most magnificent building of the 13th century was the Qutub Minar, which was founded by Aibak and completed by Iltutmish. This 71 m tower was dedicated to the Sufi saint, Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakthiyar Kaki. The balconies of this tower were projected from the main building and it was the proof of the architectural skills of that period. Later, Alauddin Khalji added an entrance to the Qutub Minar called Alai Darwaza. The dome of this arch was built on scientific lines.

**Quwaat Ul Islam Mosque**

![](_page_42_Picture_0.jpeg)

**Alai Darwaza**

The buildings of the Tughlaq period were constructed by combining arch and dome. They also used the cheaper and easily available grey colour stones. The palace complex called Tughlaqabad with its beautiful lake was built during the period of Ghyasuddin Tughlaq. Muhammad bin Tughlaq built the tomb of Ghyasuddin on a high platform. The Kotla fort at Delhi was the creation of Firoz Tughlaq. The Lodhi garden in Delhi is an example of the architecture of the Lodhis.

![](_page_43_Picture_1.jpeg)

New musical instruments such as the *sarangi* and the *rabab* were introduced during this period. Amir Khusrau introduced many new *ragas* such as Ghora and Sanam. He evolved a new style of light music known as *qawwalis* by blending the Hindu and Iranian systems. The invention of *sitar* is also attributed to him. The Indian classical work, *Ragadarpan*, was translated into Persian during the reign of Firoz Tughlaq. Pir Bhodan, a Sufi saint, was one of the great musicians of this period. Raja Man Singh of Gwalior was a great lover of music. He encouraged the composition of a great musical work called *Man Kautuhal.*

# LITERATURE

The Delhi Sultans patronised learning and literature. Many of them had great love for Arabic and Persian literature. Learned men came from Persia and Persian language got encouragement from the rulers. Besides theology and poetry, the writing of history was also encouraged. Some of the Sultans had their own court historians. The most famous historians of this period were Hasan Nizami, Minhaj-us-Siraj, Ziauddin Barani, and Shams Siraj Afif. Barani's *Tarikh-i-Firoz Shahi* contains the history of Tughlaq dynasty. Minhaj-us- Siraj wrote *Tabaqat-i-Nasari*, a general history of Muslim dynasties up to c.1260 CE.

Amir Khusrau (c.1252–1325 CE) was the most famous Persian writer of

this period. He wrote a number of poems. He experimented with several poetical forms and created a new style of Persian poetry called *Sabaq- i-Hind* or the Indian style. He also wrote some Hindi verses. Amir Khusrau's *Khazain-ul-Futuh* speaks about Alauddin's conquests. His famous work, the *Tughlaq Nama*, deals with the rise of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq.

Sanskrit and Persian functioned as link languages in the Delhi Sultanate. Zia Nakshabi was the first to translate Sanskrit stories into Persian. The book *Tutu Nama* or the Book of the Parrot became popular and was translated into Turkish and later into many European languages. The famous *Rajatarangini* written by Kalhana belonged to the period of Zain-ul- Abidin, the ruler of Kashmir. Many Sanskrit works on medicine and music were translated into Persian. In Arabic, Alberuni's *Kitab-ul-Hind* is the most famous work. Regional languages also developed during this period. Chand Bardai was the famous Hindi poet of this period. Bengali literature had also developed and Nusrat Shah patronised the translation of Mahabaratha into Bengali.
