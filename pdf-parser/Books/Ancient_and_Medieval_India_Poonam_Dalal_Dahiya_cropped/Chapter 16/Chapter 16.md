# 16 COMING OF EUROPEANS

`With the discovery of new sea route via the Cape of Good Hope by Vasco da Gama in c.1498 CE, many trading companies came to India and established their trading centres. At the outset, they entered India as traders but with the passage of time, in order to safeguard their commercial interests, they tried to dominate the politics of India. Thus, the commercial rivalry among the European powers led to political rivalry and this not only brought them in conflict with each other but with Indian rulers too.

### THE PORTUGUSE

Prince Henry of Portugal encouraged voyages for discovery of sea route to India. The first Portuguese who succeeded in reaching the Cape of Good Hope was Bartholomew Diaz in c.1487 CE. Later, following his foot steps, Vasco da Gama reached the port of Calicut on May 21, 1498 CE making it a landmark day in the history of India's maritime trade. He was warmly received by Zamorin, the Hindu ruler of Calicut and he returned to Portugal in the next year making huge profits from the Indian cargo that was worth sixty times the cost of the expedition. In c.1500 CE, another Portuguese Pedro Alvarez Cabral arrived in India and even Vasco da Gama too made a second trip in c.1502 CE. The Portuguese established trading stations at Calicut, Cannanore and Cochin.

**Vasco da Gama**

The first governor of the Portuguese in India was Francis de Almeida. Later in c.1510 CE, the second Governor Alfonso-da-Albuquerque captured Goa from the ruler of Bijapur (during reign of Sikander Lodhi) and thereafter, Goa became the capital of the Portuguese settlements in India. Albuquerque also captured Malacca and Ceylon and built a fort at Calicut. He also encouraged his countrymen to marry Indian women. At the time of his death in c.1515 CE, he left the Portuguese as the strongest naval power in India.

In c.1530 CE, Nino-da-cunha acquired Diu and Bassein from Bahadur Shah of Gujarat. Later, Portuguese settlements were also established at Daman, Salsette and Bombay on the west coast and at San Thome near Madras and Hugli in Bengal on the east coast. However, the Portuguese power declined in India by the end of the 16th century and they lost all their possessions in India except Goa, Diu and Daman. In c.1631 CE, Portuguese lost Hugli during the reign of Shahjahan. In c.1661 CE, Portuguese king gave Bombay as a gift to Charles II of England for marrying his sister. The Marathas captured Salsatte and Bassein in c.1739 CE.

Portuguese gifts to India

- (i) Cultivation of tobacco and potato
- (ii) Ist Printing press in India (c.1556 CE).

(iii) Ist scientific work on Indian medicinal plants.

Causes of Decline of Portuguese:

- 1. Religious Intolerance
- 2. Piracy
- 3. Clandestine Practices in Trade.

4. Discovery of Brazil.

# THE DUTCH

Ist Dutch Expedition which reached the East Indies was led by Cornelius Houtman in c.1596 CE. In March c.1602 CE, Dutch East India Company under the name. Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC) was formed. Interestingly, it is often considered to have been the first multinational corporation in the world and also was the first company to issue stock. Dutch set up their first factory at Masulipatnam in c.1605 CE. Other Dutch factories were at Pulicat, Chinsura, Kasimbazar, Patna, Balasore, Surat, Karaikal, Nagapattinam and Cochin. Infact, Pulicat emerged as headquarters of Dutch operations in India and from c.1617 CE, the Chief of Pulicat also functioned as Dutch Governor in India and the factory at Pulicat was known as Fort Geldria. However, Pulicat was later replaced by Nagapattinam.

The credit of dislodging the Portuguese from India's maritime trade and establishing Indian textiles as the premier export of India goes to Dutch. In c.1619 CE, the Dutch company conquered Java and by c.1623 CE effectively controlled the English Competition in the Malaya Archipelago (though by the infamous massacre of Englishman at Amboyna.) The Anglo-Dutch rivalry lasted for about seven decades during which period the Dutch lost their settlements to the British one by one and the final collapse of the Dutch came with their defeat by English in the Battle of Bedara in c.1759 CE.

# THE ENGLISH

The English East India Company was formed by a group at merchants known as 'The Merchant Adventures' in c.1599 CE. In c.1609 CE, Captain William Hawkins arrived at the court of Mughal Emperor Jahangir to seek permission to establish English trading centre at Surat. But, it was refused by the Mughal Emperor due to Portuguese pressure.

Later in c.1612 CE, Jahangir issued a *farman* (permission letter) to the English and they established a trading factory at Surat in c.1613 CE. Later in c.1615 CE, Sir Thomas Roe came to Mughal court as ambassador of James I, the King of England and obtained permission from Jahangir to establish English trading factories in different parts of India. Thus, by c.1619 CE, English established their factories at Agra, Ahmedabad, Baroda and Broach.

**Thomas Roe at the court of Jahangir**

In c.1639 CE, Francis Day obtained the site of Madras from Raja of Chandragiri which was named Fort St. George. Madras soon replaced Masulipatnam as the headquarter of English on the Coromandel coast. The English East India Company acquired Bombay from Charles II, the then King of England on lease at an annual sent of £10 in c.1668 CE and Bombay became the headquarters of the company on west coast. In c.1690 CE, an English factory was established at a place called *Sutanuti* by Job Charnock. The fortified settlement of Sutanati was named Fort William (Calcutta) which later became the capital of British India. In c.1701 CE, Emperor Aurangzeb ordered the general arrest of all the

Europeans in India due to their aggressiveness on Mughal ships and territory but English could be controlled only for a short time. In c.1715 CE, John Serman (the Governor of Calcutta) and William Hamilton cured Mughal Emperor Farukkhsiyar of a disease and gained farman (order which was also called the Magna Carta of the company) in c.1717 CE to establish offices at Bengal, Gujarat and Hyderabad.

Danes formed an East India Company in c.1616 CE. They established settlement at Tranquebar (Tamil Nadu) in c.1620 CE and at Serampore (Bengal) in c.1676 CE. Serampore was their headquarters in India. However, they failed to strengthen themselves in India and were forced to sell all their settlements in India to the British in c.1845 CE.

## THE FRENCH

The French East India Company, '*Les compangnile des Indes Orientales*', was formed in c.1664 CE by Colbert, a minister under Louis XIV. In c.1668 CE, Francis Caron established the first French factory in India at Surat. Later, Maracara set up a factory at Masulipatinam in c.1669 CE. Later, in c.1673 CE Francois Martin founded Pondicherry (Fort Louis), the headquarters of the French possessions in India and became its Ist governor too. In c.1690 CE, Chandranagore in Bengal was acquired from Shaista Khan then Mughal governor. Other French factories in India were Mahe, Balasore, Qasim Bazar and Karaikal. The arrival of Joseph Français Dupleix as French governor in India in c.1742 CE saw the beginning of Anglo-French conflict which resulted in famous Carnatic Wars.

## ANGLO-FRENCH RIVALRY

![](_page_8_Picture_0.jpeg)

### **Cause of Ist Carnatic War**

In c.1742 CE, war broke out between France and Britain in Europe over Austrian war of Succession and in c.1746 CE English started the war in India.

### **Important Battles and treaty pertaining to Ist War.**

- 1. a Battle of Adyar (c.1746 CE) (Exposed indiscipline of Indian Army)
- i. Fought between French and Mehfuz Khan (representative of Nawab Anwar-ud-din) to capture/restore Madras in which a small army of French *defeated* a huge Indian army.

(Austrian war or succession ended in Europe so battle also stopped in India)

### **Cause of IInd Carnatic War**

Nizam of Hyderabad died in c.1748 CE and this resulted in a war of succession and both English and French supported opposite camps.

### **Important Battles and Treaty pertaining to IInd War**

### (a) Battle of Ambur (c.1749 CE)

French side defeated Anwar-ud-din at Ambur and his son Mohammed Ali escaped to Tiruchirapalli for safety and surrendered to English.

Meanwhile, Chanda Sahib, the Nawab of Carnatic rewarded Dupleix by given Valudanoor, Villianoor and Bahur, near Pondicherry and marched towards Tiruchirapalli to capture Muhammed Ali.

(b) Battle of Arcot (c.1751 CE)

Robert Clive (an English officer) suggested a plan to attack Arcot (capital of Carnatic) which was approved by Governor Saunders and an army with Robert Clive and Major Lawrence. Clive captured Arcot and earned the tag of Hero of Arcot. Meanwhile, French forces and Chanda Sahib were defeated at Arni and Kaveripakkam. Chanda Sahib was beheaded in c.1752 CE. Since Dupleix failed to capture Tiruchirapalli, he was recalled to France in c.1754 CE.

(c) Treaty of Pondicherry

- (i) French possessions were given back to the France.
- (ii) English emerged as winner in Carnatic.

Since Nazir Jung (British ally), lost his life in an encounter in c.1750 CE, so Muzaffar Jung became Nizam and he amply rewarded French.

### **Cause of IIIrd Carnatic War**

The Third Carnatic War broke out due to the outbreak of the Seven Year War (c.1756–1763 CE) in Europe.

### **Important Battles and treaty pertaining to IIIrd War**

- 3. (a) Battle of Wandiwash (c.1760 CE)
  - i. English general Eyre Coot *defeated* Count de Lally.
  - ii. Count de Lally even surrendered Pondicherry
- (b) Treaty of Paris
  - Pondicherry, Karaikal and other French possessions were returned to the French on condition that they should not fortify them.
  - Ended the French ambition in India.

The different causes for the French failure in Anglo-French rivalry can be summed up as follows:

- 1. Commercial and naval superiority of the English.
- 2. Lack of support from the French government.
- 3. French had support only in the Deccan but the English had a strong base in Bengal.
- 4. English had three important ports – Calcutta, Bombay and Madras but French had only one Pondicherry.
- 5. Difference of opinion between the French Generals.
- 6. England's victory in the European wars decided the destiny of the French in India.

# BRITISH CONQUEST IN INDIA

In c.1705 CE, Aurangzeb appointed Murshid Quli Khan as Governor of Bengal and later placed Orissa under his authority. Murshid Quli Khan shifted capital from Dacca to Murshidabad and after death of Aurangzeb, founded an independent state.

- This dual government was ended by Warren Hastings.

### Mir Jafar

Mir Qasim (His son-in-law)

- As Mir Jafar was not able to satisfy the demands of the English, he was forced to resign in c.1760 CE and Mir Qasim was put on throne who proved to be an efficient and strong ruler.
- He checked the misuse of the farman of c.1717 CE (granted by Emperor Farrukhsiyar) by the company officials as they used to evade customs duty.

Hyder Ali was an able general and he strengthened his army by including French soldiers.

![](_page_17_Picture_0.jpeg)

![](_page_18_Figure_0.jpeg)

#### Cause of IInd Mysore War

- Mysore was attacked by Marathas in c.1771 CE. As per treaty of Madras, English (Under Verelst) did not help Hyder Ali. So Hyder Ali wanted an opportunity to strike at English.
- When Mahe, a French possession in the dominion of Hyder Ali was attacked by the English, Hyder Ali declared war on

1. Ist Maratha War (c.1775 – 1782 CE): During the reign of Warren Hastings

### **Background**

In c.1772 CE, Madhava Rao (Maratha Peshwa) died who had no issue

Narayan Rao, younger brother of Madhava Rao succeeded to the throne but his Uncle Raghunath Rao alias Raghoba murdered him

and announced himself next Peshwa, but Maratha leaders disregarded authority of Raghoba and under able leadership of Nana Phadnavis appointed Madhava Rao Narayana, the infant son of Narayan Rao.

![](_page_22_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Nana Phadnavis**

– Madhava Rao Narayana (Son of Narayan Rao) Infuriated by this harsh treatment, Raghoba went to British to seek their help for obtaining Peshwaship. To fructify their agreement, Treaty of Surat was signed between Raghoba and Bombay Governor, without the knowledge of Warren Hastings. Raghoba agreed to hand over islands of Salsette and Bassein to British.

– Battle at Talegaon (c.1776 CE) was fought in which Marathas defeated British and Treaty of Purandhar (c.1776 CE), was signed much to the advantage of Marathas and Nana Phadnavis position was raised among Marathas .

Later, Treaty of Salbai (c.1782 CE) was signed between Marathas and British

- It gave British 20 years of respite from Maratha's menace
- English returned all the Maratha territories except Salsette.
- Raghoba was granted pension of 3 lakh a year.

![](_page_23_Figure_6.jpeg)

#### Cause of IInd Maratha War

Great Maratha statesman Nana Phadnavis died in c.1800 CE and after his death, war broke out between Bhonsle and Sindhia. Peshwa Baji Rao II (weak ruller) approached English for protection.

2. a) Treaty of Bassein (c.1802 CE)

English defeated combined armies of Sindhia and Bhonsle under Wellesley and forced them Subsidiary Alliance. But, British failed to defeat Holkar. So, Treaty of Rajpurghat (c.1806 CE) was signed and Wellesley was recalled from India.

#### Pindari War (c.1817-18 CE)

Hastings assembled a large force to round up and exterminate seemingly lawless Pindaris and their chiefs.

![](_page_24_Figure_0.jpeg)

- To satisfy Maratha pride, a small state of Satara was created under Pratab Singh, a descendent of Shivaji.
- Baji Rao II was given annual pension of 8 lakh rupees.
- Bombay Presidency was formed in this region.
- In c.1818 CE, British become supreme rulers in India.

## ANGLO-SIKH WARS

Death of Ranjit Singh in c.1839 CE was followed by political instability. Next three rulers Khanak Singh, Nao Nihal Singh and Sher Singh were murdered within next 6 years (c.1839-45 CE). In such unstable environment, without much effective control over army Dalip Singh, 5 year old son of Ranjit singh, ascended the throne in c.1845 CE. However, British encirclement of Punjab had started from c.1833 CE, when they appointed British Residents at Ludhiana and Sindh.

## ANNEXATION OF SINDH

![](_page_25_Picture_0.jpeg)

# (C.1843 CE)

### **Causes for Annexation:**

- (i) Commercial possibilities of the Indus.
- (ii) British fear of expansion of Russian Empire towards east.
- (iii) British desire to increase influence in Persia and Afghanistan through control over Sindh.

Earlier Background according to time line:

*c.1809 CE*: Lord Minto sent an ambassador to the Amirs and concluded a friendship treaty with them.

*c.1831 CE*: Journey of Alexander Burnes up the Indus on his way to Lahore.

*c.1832 CE*: Treaty by Lord Bentinck by which roads and rivers of Sindh were opened to English trade.

*c.1839 CE*: Lord Auckland forced the Amirs to sign Subsidiary Alliance and Lord Ellenborough unnecessarily provoked the Armies and people of Sindh into a war.

*c.1842 CE*: Appointment of Sir Charles Napier as British Resident in place of Major James Outram.

*c.1843 CE*: Charles Napier, destructed *Imamgarh*, the famous desert fortress. In retaliation of this, Baluchis attacked the British Resident and declared war on British. The Battle of Miani ensued in which Baluchi army was defeated by Napier and some amirs had to surrender. Later, Battle of Dabo happened in which Napier defeated Sher Muhammad (Amir of Mirpur)and thus Sher Muhammad was expelled from Sindh resulting in formal annexation of Sindh (c.1843 CE). Napier was appointed as Ist Governor of Sindh and interestingly he sent a telegram to the British headquarters exclaiming, *I have Sin (ne)d*.

After the annexation of Sindh a series of battle happened between British and Sikh Rulers which form part of Ist Anglo Sikh War (c.1845-

#### 1846 CE):

- a. Battle of Muduks (c.1845 CE) was fought between Lal Singh (Prime Minister of Sikhs) and Sir Hugh Gough in which Sikh Army was defeated
- b. Battle of Ferozepur (c.1845 CE) was fought between Sikh Army under Tej Singh (got defeated) and British.
- c. Battle of Buddewal (c.1846 CE) was fought between Ranjeet Singh Maihithia (got defeated) and Harry Smith.
- d. Battle of Guns/Battle of Sabraon (c.1846 CE): One of the decisive battle fought between British (Harry Smith) and Sikhs. The British emerged victorious and they not only crossed Sutlej but occupied Lahore too. This resulted in signing of Treaty of Lahore (c.1846 CE) according to which:
  - Jalandhar Daob was given to British along with a demand for payment of 1 ½ crore to be paid to British. Sikhs paid only half of this amount and for settling the rest they sold Kashmir to British who sold it further to Gulab Singh.
  - Appointment of British Resident at Lahore (Sir Henry Lawrence)
  - Recognition of Dalip Singh and Rani Jind Kaur by British.

Maharani Jind Kaur, who was acting as regent of her son, Dalip Singh, had believed that, as stipulated in the treaty of Lahore, the British force would leave Lahore. But the British, instead of quitting, started strengthening their authority over Lahore administration. This led to the signing of the Treaty of Bhairowal (c.1846 CE) also known as IInd Treaty of Lahore through which Rani Jind Kaur was removed and a regency council for Punjab was set up (consisting of 8 sikh sardars) and presided over by Sir Henry Lawrence and British force was stationed at Lahore for which Sikhs also needed to pay 22 lacs. The treaty of Bhairowal transformed the Sikh kingdom into a virtual British protectorate. Thus, ground for another confrontation was set.

Thus, in order to avenge humiliation of Ist war and also bad treatment accorded to Rani Jind Kaur, IInd Anglo Sikh war (c.1848-49 CE) occured. The IInd War resulted in annexation of Punjab by Lord

Dalhousie in c.1849 CE and Dalip Singh and Rani Jind Kaur were transported to England. A board of 3 commissioners was established consisting of:
