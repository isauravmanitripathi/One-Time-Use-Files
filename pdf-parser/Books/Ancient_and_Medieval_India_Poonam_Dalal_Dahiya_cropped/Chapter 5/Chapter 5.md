## 5 BUDDHISM AND JAINISM

Sixth century BCE was a period of great religious upheaval. Great teachers like Confucius in China, Zoroaster in Iran, and Parmenides in Greece questioned the established socioreligious norms and focused more on ethical and moral values. In India, the scenario was no different. India witnessed the growth of two great alternative religions: Buddhism and Jainism. These religions emphasised that true happiness does not lie in material prosperity or performance of rituals, but in nonviolence, charity, frugality, and good social conduct. Various reasons are attributed to the origin and popularity of these two important and potent religious reform movements.

## CAUSES OF ORIGIN

- a. The Kshatriyas' reaction against domination of the Brahmanas: The post Vedic society was clearly divided into four *varnas*: Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras. Kshatriyas (who functioned as rulers and warriors) were ranked second in the *varna* hierarchy. They reacted strongly against the ritualistic domination of the Brahmanas and the various privileges enjoyed by the priestly class (such as receiving gifts and exemption from taxation and punishment). It is rather unsurprising that both Buddha and Mahavira (key leaders of Buddhism and Jainism), who strongly disputed the authority of the Brahmanas, belonged to the Kshatriya *varna*. Equally interesting is the fact that Buddhist Pali texts frequently reject the Brahmanical claim to innate superiority and reverses the Brahmanical order of rank, thus placing Kshatriyas higher than the Brahmanas.
- b. Rise of new agricultural economy which demanded animal husbandry: In the sixth century BCE, as we have noted earlier,

the centre of economic and political activity shifted from Haryana and Western UP to Eastern UP and Bihar, which had more rainfall and more fertile land. Since it was now easier to exploit the iron ore resources of Bihar and adjoining regions, people started using more and more iron tools and ploughshare to clear the thick forest cover and cultivate the hitherto unexplored areas. The agricultural economy based on iron ploughshare required the use of bullocks, and thus could only flourish with animal husbandry. But the Vedic practice of animal sacrifice resulted in killing of cattle indiscriminately and stood in the way of the progress of the new agricultural economy. Thus, for the stability and prosperity of the new agrarian economy, this slaughtering of animals had to be stopped. Since both Buddhism and Jainism advocated nonviolence and were strongly against any form of sacrifices, they were found promising to the peasant masses.

c. Patronising of Buddhism and Jainism by Vaishyas and other mercantile groups who wanted better social status and a reign of peace: As we are well aware, the sixth century BCE is known as the era of second urbanisation in the Indian sub-continent. Expansion of agriculture resulted in improved food supply and helped in the development of craft production, trade, and urban centres. The development of trade is reflected in discovery of thousands of silver and copper **Punch-Marked Coins** (**PMC**) by the numismatists. More than sixty towns and cities such as Patliputra, Rajagriha, Shravasti, Varanasi, Vaishali, Champa, Kaushambi, and Ujjaini developed between 600 and 300 BCE. These cities became centres of craft production and trade, and were inhabited by a large number of artisans and merchants. This general economic progress had led to the rise of the Vaishyas and other mercantile groups, who wanted better social position than what the Brahmanas gave them. Since Buddhism and Jainism did not attach any importance to the existing *varna* system, preferred to patronise non-Vedic religions like Buddhism and Jainism through substantial donations. Also,

both Buddhism and Jainism preached the gospel of nonviolence, which could put an end to wars between different kingdoms, and consequently promote further trade and commerce, which was beneficial for this economic class.

d. Ready acceptance of simple, ascetic, peace-centred principles of Buddhism and Jainism by general folk (laity): The improvement in agriculture and development of trade, money, and urbanisation had an impact on the society as well. Due to these changes, traditional equality and brotherhood gave way to inequality and social conflict. People wanted some kind of reprieve from the increasing social problems like violence, cruelty, theft, hatred, and falsehood. Common people yearned to return to simple, primitive, and uncorrupt life. Therefore, when new religions such as Buddhism and Jainism preached the concept of peace and social equality, simple and puritan ascetic living, people welcomed it.

## GAUTAMA BUDDHA AND BUDDHISM

## **Early Buddhist Literature**

Our understanding of Gautama Buddha and various other facets of Buddhism is derived mostly from early Buddhist literature. Early Buddhist literature is generally divided into canonical and noncanonical texts. Canonical texts are those texts that are directly linked to Gautama Buddha in one way or another. However, differences exist among various Buddhist schools as to which texts are canonical. They can simply be understood as books which lay down the basic tenets and principles of Buddhism, such as, the *Tipitakas* (Three *Pitakas*, also known as the Pali canon). Non-canonical texts or semi canonical texts are texts that are not the sayings of the Buddha, but commentaries and observations on canonical texts, treatise on the Dharma/*Dhammapada*,

historical information, quotes, definitions, grammars, and other writings in Pali, Tibetan, Chinese, and other East Asian languages. Some important non-canonical texts are *Milindapanho* (written in Pali, it consists of a dialogue on various philosophical issues between the Indo-Greek king Milinda/Menander and the monk Nagasena), *Nettipakarana* (The Book of Guidance, which gives a connected account of the Buddha's teachings), *Visuddhimagga* (The Path to Purity, written by Buddhaghosa, deals with development from purity of discipline to *nibanna*/enlightenment), *Nidanakatha* (first connected life story of Buddha), the *Dipavamsa* and the *Mahavamsa* (written in Pali, both contain historical cum mythical account of the Buddha's life, Buddhist councils, Ashoka, and arrival of Buddhism to Sri Lanka), and *Mahavastu* (written in mixed Sanskrit–Prakrit, it lays down the sacred biography, i.e., hagiography of the Buddha.)

The *Tipitaka* (in Pali) and *Tripitaka* (in Sanskrit) meaning 'The Three Baskets/Collections' is one of the earliest compilations of Buddhist teachings written (originally) on long, narrow leaves. The Buddhist monks transcribed and categorised the Buddha's teachings in three baskets, which is how the name 'Three Baskets' originated. All branches of Buddhism have the *Tripitaka* as part of their core scriptures, which comprises three books — the *Sutta* (conventional teaching), the *Vinaya* (disciplinary code), and the *Abhidhamma* (moral psychology).

- a. The *Sutta Pitaka* (*Sutra*/Basket of Discourses): This contains the Buddha's discourses on various doctrinal issues in dialogue form. These texts are also known as '*Buddhavacana*' or 'the word of the Buddha', as it refers to texts that are supposed to contain *what the Buddha himself said*. With the exception of few *sutras*, the authority of this text is accepted by all Buddhist schools. These discourses were arranged on the basis of the manner in which they were delivered.
- b. The *Vinaya Pitaka* (Discipline Basket): This contains rules for monks and nuns of the monastic order (*Sangha*). It includes the *Patimokka* – a list of transgressions against monastic discipline and atonements for these. Apart from monastic rules, the *Vinaya* texts also include doctrinal expositions, ritual texts,

biographical stories, and some elements of the '*Jatakas*' or 'birth stories'.

c. The *Abhidhamma Pitaka* (Basket of Higher Teachings): This contains a thorough study and systemisation of the teachings of the *Sutta Pitaka* through summaries, questions and answers, lists, etc.

The three *Pitakas* are divided into *Nikayas* (books). For instance, the *Sutta Pitaka* consists of five *Nikayas*: *Digha Nikaya* (collection of long discourses), *Majjhima Nikaya* (collection of medium-length discourses), *Samyutta Nikaya* (collection of kindred sayings), *Anguttara Nikaya* (collection of discourses arranged in accordance with number), and *Khuddaka Nikaya* (smaller collection). The *Khuddaka Nikaya* is further subdivided into fifteen books, the prominent among them being the *Jatakas* (stories of the previous births of the Buddha), *Dhammapada* (verses dealing with ethical sayings), *Niddesa* (expositions), *Buddhavamsa* (the history of Buddha), *Patisambhida* (analytical knowledge), the *Theragatha* and *Therigatha* (songs of Buddhist monks and nuns).

### **Life of the Buddha**

The *hagiography* (sacred biography) of Buddha is briefed in the *Sutta* and *Vinaya Pitakas*, which is further explained in a more detailed and connected way in later texts of *Buddhacharita, Mahavastu*, and *Nidanakatha.* According to tradition, Gautama Buddha (also known as Sakyamuni / Tathagata) was born as Siddhartha in 563 BCE on Vaishakha Poornima Day at Lumbini (near Kapilavastu, Nepal) to Suddhodana (chief of republican Sakya clan, who ruled from Kapilavastu in the Kosala Kingdom). His mother Mahamaya (princess of the Kosala dynasty), gave birth and died seven days after his birth. Siddhartha was thus raised by his step-mother Gautami. It is believed that soon after he was born, certain Brahmanas saw the 32 marks of a *Mahapurusha* (great man) on his body and predicted that either he would be a world conqueror or a world renouncer. His father wanted to keep him away from the path of renunciation, hence he shielded him from all sorrows, and brought him up in luxury and comfort.

**The Buddha**

At the early age of 16 years, he was married to Yashodhara and had a son named Rahula. However, at the age of 29, after seeing an old man, a sick man, a corpse, and an ascetic, he decided to become a wanderer and left his palace with Channa, the charioteer, and his favourite horse,

Kanthaka, in search of truth (*Mahabhinishkramana*/Great Renunciation) and wandered for six years. He meditated with established teachers of that era – firstly with Alara Kalama and then with Uddaka Ramaputta – but was not convinced with their instructions that man could obtain liberation from sorrow by mental discipline and knowledge only. Later on, accompanied by five wandering ascetics – Kondanna, Bhaddiya, Vappa, Mahanama, and Assaji – he practiced severe austerities until his body was almost emaciated. Realising that austerities could not lead to realisation, he abandoned them. His five ascetic companions, disgusted at his seeming failure, deserted him and left for Sarnath. He then moved towards the village of Senani, where he was offered a bowl of milk-rice by a low-caste village girl, Sujata. Accepting from a grass-cutter a gift of *kusa* grass for a mat, he took a seat under a *Peepal* tree facing east. Here he resolved not to rise again until enlightenment was attained.

"Here on this seat my body may shrivel up,

my skin, my bones, my flesh may dissolve,

but my body will not move from this seat

until I have attained Enlightenment,

so difficult to obtain in the course of many *kalpas*".

As Gautama sat in deep meditation, Mara, the Lord of Illusions, perceiving that his power was about to be broken, rushed to distract him from his purpose. Gautama touched the earth, calling it to bear witness the countless lifetimes of virtue that had led him to this place of enlightenment. When the earth shook, confirming the truth of Gautama's words, Mara unleashed his army of demons. In the epic battle that ensued, Gautama's wisdom broke through the illusions and the power of his compassion transformed the demons' weapons into flowers. Mara and all his forces fled in disarray. Thus, at the age of 35, he ultimately attained Nirvana/Enlightenment at Gaya, Magadha (Bihar) under a Peepal tree at Uruvela, on the banks of river Niranjana, and came to be known as the Buddha, the Enlightened One. The Peepal tree was known as the famous Bodhi tree. It is believed that Asoka's queen Tissarakkha was jealous of the tree, and three years after she became queen (i.e., in the nineteenth year of Ashoka's reign) she caused the tree to be killed by means of *mandu* thorns. The tree, however, grew again.

The tree was again cut down by King Pushyamitra Shunga in the second century BCE, and by King Shashanka in 600 CE. Every time the tree was destroyed, a new tree was planted at the same place; and this tree at Bodh Gaya is still revered by Buddhists.

The Buddha delivered his first Sermon on deliverance from suffering to his five former companions in a deer park at Sarnath. This event is known as '*DhammaChakka-Pavattana'* meaning *'turning the wheel of dharma'.* His five disciples soon realised the truth themselves and became *Arhats.* The Buddha wandered about, teaching his doctrine for over four decades, and established an order of monks and nuns known as the *Sangha.* He finally attained *Parinibbana* at the age of 80 at Kusinara (lying in Mallas). It is believed that his last words were, "All composite things decay, strive diligently".

Buddha is represented in five forms:

- Lotus and Bull – Birth
- Horse – Renunciation
- Bodhi Tree – Mahabodhi
- *Dhammachakra Pravartana* – First Sermon
- Footprints – Nirvana

## **Doctrines of Buddhism**

The core of Buddha's doctrine is expressed in the *Ariya-Sachchani* (Four Noble Truths)*, Ashtangika-Marga* (Eight-Fold Path), Middle Path, Social Code of Conduct, and Attainment of *Nibbana*/*Nirvana*. Buddha explains that his teachings are just like a raft, which helps one to cross over the turbulent river of Life and Suffering. Once across, we do not need to cart the raft around with us. In other words, Buddha urges that one should not cling to anything, including his teachings. The teachings are only *Upaya* (skillful means or expedient tools) and are thus not dogma: "*It is fingers pointing at the moon and one should not confuse the finger for the moon."*

His teachings contain three important pillars:

- Buddha – Founder/ Teacher
- *Dhamma* – Teachings

• *Sangha* – Order of Buddhist monks/nuns (who act as torch bearers of *Dhamma* worshippers or *Upasakas* and are a major factor in the dissemination of the Buddha's doctrine)

While struggling for Enlightenment, Buddha had discovered Dhamma/Four Noble Truths which form the central teachings of Buddhism. The Four Noble Truths are:

![](_page_9_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Buddha's four Noble Truths**

- a. *The Truth of Suffering* (*Dukkha*): Buddha taught that everything is suffering (*sabbam dukkham*). It refers not only to the actual pain and sorrow experienced by an individual, but also to the potential to experience these things.
- b. *The Truth of the Cause of Suffering* (*Samudaya*)*:* Suffering is part of living and there is a reason behind it. Desire (*Trishna*) is main cause of suffering.
- c. *The Truth of the End of Suffering* (*Nirodha*)*:* This suffering can be ended by attaining Nirvana*/Nibbana.*
- d. *The Truth of the Path Leading to the End of Suffering* (*Astangika-Marga*): There is a path that leads to the end of suffering.

Buddha urged people to study, meditate, think, and act in ways that can help them come to a full understanding of each of these Four Noble Truths and to stay on the path that will lead them to peace and happiness. Paradoxically, the Eight-Fold Path is more about unlearning rather than learning, i.e., to learn in order to unlearn and uncover. This path consists of eight interconnected activities and is a process that

helps one to move beyond the conditioned responses that obscure his/her true nature. The *Astangika-Marga* comprises the following:

![](_page_10_Figure_1.jpeg)

- 1. Right Vision or understanding (*Samma-Ditthi*): It signifies perfect view or understanding of the nature of reality and the path of transformation.
- 2. Right Thought or Attitude (*Samma-Sankappa*): It signifies having an emotional intelligence and acting from love and compassion.
- 3. Right or Whole Speech (*Samma-Vaca*): It signifies clear, truthful, uplifting, and non-harmful communication.
- 4. Right or Integral Action (*Samma-Kammanta*): It signifies an ethical foundation of life, based on the principle of nonexploitation of oneself and others. It includes The Five Precepts (training rules), which are like an ethical code of conduct governing the behaviour of members of the monastic order and the laity. Following are the Five Precepts:
  - a. Do not commit violence (to undertake the training to avoid taking the life of beings): This precept applies to all living beings and not just humans, as all beings have a right to their lives and that right should be respected.
  - b. Do not covet the property of others (to undertake the training to avoid taking things not given): This precept

goes further than mere stealing, as it preaches that one should avoid taking anything unless one is totally sure that it is intended for him only.

- c. Do not indulge in corrupt practices or sensual behaviour (to undertake the training to avoid sensual misconduct): This precept covers overindulgence in any sensual pleasure, such as gluttony, or misconduct of a sexual nature. For laity, celibacy was replaced by chastity.
- d. Do not speak a lie (to undertake the training to refrain from false speech): This precept covers slander, lying, deceiving, and speech that is not beneficial to the welfare of others.
- e. Do not use intoxicants (to undertake the training to abstain from substances which cause intoxication and heedlessness): This precept is in a special category as it does not infer any intrinsic evil in, say, alcohol itself, but believes that indulgence in such a substance could be the cause of breaking the other four precepts.

In addition to these, monks and nuns were supposed to strictly observe three additional precepts, which are:

- i. To avoid eating after mid-day
- ii. To abstain from dancing, singing, music, and other entertainment, as well as to refrain from using perfumes, ornaments, and other items used to adorn or beautify a person
- iii. To abstain from using high or luxurious beds, and from handling gold and silver (including money)
- 5. Right Livelihood or Proper Livelihood (*Samma-Ajiva*): It signifies a livelihood based on correct action and on the ethical principal of non-exploitation. According to Buddha, it formed the basis of an ideal society.
- 6. Right Effort or Energy/ Vitality (*Samma-Vayama*): It signifies consciously directing our life energy to the transformative path of creative and healing action that fosters wholeness, thus moving towards conscious evolution.

Right Mindfulness or Complete/Thorough Awareness (*Samma-*

- 7. *Sati*)*:* It signifies developing awareness about oneself and keenly watching self behaviour. Buddha says that "if you hold yourself dear, watch yourself well".
- 8. Right Concentration or Meditation (*Samma-Samadhi*): It signifies '*Samadhi*' in the sense of enlightenment or Buddhahood. *Samadhi* literally means to be fixed, absorbed in or established at one point, thus the first level of meaning is concentration, when the mind is fixed on a single object. The second level of meaning goes further and represents the establishment, not just of the mind, but also of the whole being in various levels or modes of consciousness and awareness.

The path taught by the Buddha is often referred to as the Middle Path (the one between extreme indulgence and extreme asceticism.) It should be noted that 'Right' here signifies 'proper', 'whole', 'thorough', 'integral', 'complete', and 'perfect'. It does not necessarily mean 'right', as opposed to 'wrong'. For instance, the opposite of 'Right Awareness' is not necessarily 'Wrong Awareness'. It may simply be 'incomplete'. Buddha had emphasised that if a person follows this Eight-Fold Path, then he will reach his destination of attaining *Nibbana*/Nirvana without the machinations of the priests.

*Nibbana*/Nirvana is the ultimate goal of Buddha's teachings. The Pali word *Nibbana* is formed of '*Ni'* and '*Vana'*. '*Ni*' is a negative particle and '*Vana*' means lusting or craving. It is called *Nibbana*, as it is a departure from the craving or lusting. Literally, *Nibbana* means nonattachment. It does not mean physical death; rather, it signifies dying out or extinction of desire, attachment, greed, ignorance, hatred, and even the sense of ego. *Nibbana* for the Buddhists is neither a mere nothingness, nor a state of annihilation; but what it is, no words can adequately express. *Nibbana* is a *Dhamma* which is 'unborn, unoriginated, uncreated, and unformed'. Hence, it is eternal (*dhuva*), desirable (*subha*), and happy (*sukha*). In *Nibbana,* nothing is 'eternalised', nor is anything 'annihilated', besides suffering. *Nibbana* is not situated in any place, nor is it a sort of heaven where a transcendental ego resides. It is a supramundane state and an attainment

(*dhamma*) which is within the reach of all, even in this present life. Buddhism does not state that this ultimate goal can be reached only in a life beyond. Here, lies the **chief difference** between the Buddhist conception of *Nibbana* and the non-Buddhist conception of an eternal heaven, attainable only after death or a union with a God or Divine Essence in an after-life. When *Nibbana* is realised in this life with the body remaining, it is called *sopadisesa nibbana-dhatu.* When an *Arhat* attains *parinibbana* (complete or final dying out, only used for death of enlightened beings such as Buddha), after the dissolution of his body, without any remainder of physical existence, it is called *anupadisesa nibbana-dhatu.*

It should be noted that **Buddhism accepts** the **transmigration** and **impermanence**, but **rejects** the **idea of God** and **soul** (*atman*). According to Buddha, the soul is a myth. In the Buddhist universe, there are many realms (worlds) and many different kinds of beings; one can be born as any one of them. Traditionally, Buddhism teaches the existence of the ten realms of being. At the top is Buddha and the scale descends as follows: *Bodhisattva* (an enlightened being destined to be a Buddha, but purposely remaining on earth to teach others), *Pratyeka Buddha* (a Buddha on their own), *Sravaka* (direct disciple of Buddha), heavenly beings (superhuman angels), human beings, *Asura* (fighting spirits), beasts, *Preta* (hungry ghosts), and depraved men (hellish beings). These ten realms are 'mutually immanent and mutually inclusive, each one having in it the remaining nine realms'. For example, the realm of human beings has all the other nine states (from hell to Buddhahood). Man is at the same time capable of real selfishness, creating his own hell, or is truly compassionate, reflecting the compassion of Buddha. Buddhism states that man is characteristically placed at the midpoint of the ten stages; he can either lower himself abruptly or gradually into hell, or rise to the enlightened state of the Buddha through discipline, cultivation and the awakening of faith. The connection between different lives is established by *Karma.* As *o*pposed to ritual action of Brahmanical tradition, *Karma* in Buddhist tradition is result of an action depending on the intention more than the action itself. Buddhism entails less feelings of guilt and puts

great emphasis on 'mind'. Buddha stresses that it is mental anguish, such as remorse, anxiety, guilt, etc., which is to be avoided in order to cultivate a calm and peaceful mind. Rebirth is governed by the cumulative results of the *Karma* of a particular life. It is rather interesting to note that even though Buddhism emphasises on nonviolence (*ahimsa*), yet it does not necessarily entail vegetarianism; and monks were not forbidden from eating meat.

## **Buddhism and Brahmanism**

The Buddhist monks considered *varna* based on action, unlike the Brahmanas, who conferred on it a divine sanction, dividing people based on birth. In *Anguttara Nikaya*, it is mentioned that when a person joins the *Sangha*, he becomes *vevanniyanti* (without *varna*). The *Sangha* had members from all castes, such as Mahakassapa, Sariputta, Mahamoggallana (prominent Brahmana monks), the Buddha, Ananda, Aniruddha (prominent Kshatriya monks), Upali (a barber), Chunda (blacksmith who fed the Buddha his last meal). The Pali canon also reverses the order of rank and places the Kshatriya *varna* higher than the Brahmana.

Even though Buddhism was certainly more inclusive than the Brahmanical tradition, yet it supported social order based on classes and did not aim at abolishing social differences. Certain Buddhist tradition rules tried to maintain the status quo. For instance, there were a number of conditions for entry, such as the ban on the entry of debtors, slaves, and soldiers without permission from their respective masters. This was naturally biased against these social dropouts. Similarly, both Brahmanism and Buddhism emphasised on the virtues of carrying out familial obligations, protecting private property and respecting political authority. Both also did not participate directly in production and lived on alms given by society.

## **Reasons for Spread and Popularity of Buddhism**

Buddhism left an abiding mark on the history of India and it gradually became popular in Magadha and other parts of the country. With the support of Emperor Ashoka, it further spread its wings to Central Asia, West Asia and Sri Lanka, gradually transforming into a world religion. Various reasons are attributed to its spread:

- a. Buddhism appealed to the common man as, unlike Brahmanism, it was far more liberal and democratic. Since it attacked the *varna* system, it particularly won the support of the lower classes. It was open to people of all castes, and even women were admitted to the Sangha. This section of the society was neither given sacred threads nor was allowed to read Vedas, so conversion to Buddhism freed them from marks of inferiority. Buddhism also found a virgin soil for conversion in terms of the non-Vedic people. The people of Magadha readily accepted Buddhism as they were earlier looked down upon by the orthodox Brahmanas, who considered Magadha to be out of the holy *Aryavarta*.
- b. The Buddha's personality and his rationale doctrine helped immensely in the popularity of Buddhism. He tried to win over opponents by his wit and presence of mind, and by maintaining poise and calm under difficult situations.
- c. Unlike Brahmanism, whose texts were in Sanskrit and hence accessible only to a few Brahmanas. The Buddha's teachings were in Pali (the language of the common man), which further aided in the spread of Buddhism.
- d. The patronisation by monarchies of Magadha, Kosala, Kaushambhi, and several other *Gana-Sanghas* and their people contributed to its further popularity.
- e. Buddhism tried to mitigate the evils resulting from the new material life of the sixth century BCE. Since the Buddhists had a keen awareness of the problems (social and economic disparities), they presented innovative solutions to these concerns. Buddhism asked people not to accumulate wealth, indulge in cruelty or violence – ideas that were welcomed by the people.

## **Reasons for the Decline of Buddhism**

It is rather ironical that from early 12th century, Buddhism began to disappear from the land of its birth. Various reasons are responsible for this:

- a. Buddhism succumbed to the same rituals and dogmas which it had originally denounced. In the beginning, it was inspired by the spirit of reform. But, gradually it became victim to the same evils of Brahmanism which it had earlier fought. It changed for worse over period of time. The Buddhist monks gave up Pali, the language of the people, and took to Sanskrit, the language of a few intellectuals.
- b. Later, from first century CE, they also practised large scale idol worship and received numerous offerings from the devotees. This resulted in corruption of the ascetic life of Buddhist monks. The principles prescribed by Buddha were conveniently forgotten, and thus started the degradation of the Buddhist monks and their preaching.
- c. Some Brahmana rulers, such as Pushyamitra Shunga, the Huna King Mihirakula (worshipper of Shiva), and Shaivite Shashank of Gauda, persecuted the Buddhists on a large scale. The liberal donations to the monasteries gradually declined. Also, some rich monasteries were specially targeted by the Turkish and other invaders.

#### **Important Buddhist Writers**

a) Asvaghosha: Author of the '*Buddhacharita*' in Sanskrit. Contemporary of Kanishka. He was a poet, dramatist, musician, scholar, and debater.

b) Nagarjuna: He is considered to be the founder of the *Madhyamaka* school of Mahayana Buddhism. He was a friend and contemporary of

Satvahana King Gautamiputra of Andhra.

c) Asanga and Vasubandhu: Two brothers who flourished in the Punjab region in the fourth century CE. Asanga was the most important teacher of *Yogachara* or *Vijnanavada* school founded by his guru, Maitreyanatha. Vasubandhu's greatest work, *Abhidharmakosa*, is still considered an important encyclopaedia of Buddhism.

d) Buddhaghosa: He lived in the fifth century and was a great Pali scholar. His best-known work is the *Visuddhimagga* 'Path of Purification', a comprehensive summary and analysis of the *Theravada* understanding of the Buddha's path to liberation.

d) A School of Buddhism which treats Buddha as nothing more than a human being. Does not believe in idol worship and tries to attain individual salvation through self discipline and meditation. Ultimate aim of Hinayana is thus nirvana.

A school of Buddhism which treats Buddha as god and worships idols of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas embodying Buddha Nature. Mahayana believes in universal liberation from suffering for all beings (hence the '*Great Vehicle*'). Ultimate aim of Mahayana is 'spiritual upliftment'. It allows salvation to be alternatively obtained through the grace of the Amitabh Buddha by means of faith and devotion to mindfulness of the Buddha. It believes in

It is an esoteric extension of Buddhist thought and practice which sees itself as a quicker, more effective path to enlightenment. Its followers believed that salvation can be best attained by acquiring the magical power, which they called *Vajra*. As with Mahayana Buddhism, the Vajrayana emphasises the role of the Bodhisattva, but the tradition tends to favour fierce deities known as the Taras. Vajrayana ritual and devotion employs *mantras* (esoteric verbal formulas), *mandalas* (diagrams and paintings used in visualisation practices), and a complex array of other rituals. Great emphasis is placed on the role of the *guru* in the Vajrayana; these are religious teachers who have mastered the philosophical and ritual tradition. The Tibet translation of guru is '*lama*', and the various Tibetan schools of the Vajrayana trace long lineages of *gurus* who serve both as religious and political leaders (the Dalai Lama is the most well known of Tibet's Lamas).

## VARDHAMAN MAHAVIRA AND JAINISM

## **Early Jain Literature**

Jaina teachings were first preserved as an oral tradition, but later they were collated and recorded. In olden times, monks strictly followed the five great vows of Jainism. Even religious scriptures were considered possessions and therefore knowledge of the religion was never documented. Later Jaina teachers realised that it was extremely difficult to keep memorising the entire Jain literature compiled by the many scholars of the past and present. In fact, significant knowledge was already lost and the rest was polluted with modifications and errors.

Hence, they decided to document the Jaina literature as known to them. The word 'canon' for the Jaina holy writings is increasingly felt to be inadequate, for it implies an unchanging body of texts sanctioned by a central authority. The sacred books of the Jainas are known as *Siddhanta* or *Agama* ('what has come down to us' or tradition) and these earliest texts are in an eastern dialect of Prakrit known as *Ardh-Magadhi*. To a large extent, the concepts of *Siddhanta* and *Agama* denote fluid groupings that are open to change. The complication of the entire canon is traditionally believed to have taken place in the fifth or sixth century CE at a council presided over by Devarddhi Kshamashramana held in Vallabhi in Gujarat. Compilations such as *Acharanga Sutra*, Sutrakritanga, *and the Kalpasutra* are regarded as the early texts. Jainism around third century CE split into two major sects, the *Digambara*/Sky-clad or naked, and the *Shvetambara*/Clad in White*.* Lord Mahavira's immediate disciples were known as *Ganadharas* (these disciples were mendicants, as the *Jina* is, and have followed him since before his enlightenment)*.* All *Ganadharas* possessed perfect knowledge (*keval-gyan*). They orally compiled the direct preaching of Lord Mahavira into 12 main texts (*sutras*). These texts are known as *Angas* (limbs or main texts) and are the oldest religious scriptures and the backbone of Jaina literature. Monks who had knowledge of a minimum of ten *Purvas* (means 'early' or 'previous texts' which are considered original teachings of the *Jinas*) were known as *Srut-kevlis*. The *Srut-kevlis* wrote many texts (*sutras*) expanding the subject matter defined in the *Angas*. Collectively, these texts are called *Angbahyas* (meaning outside of *Angas*). The *Shvetambara* canon includes the 12 *Angas*; 12 *Upangas* (scriptures which provide further explanation of *Angas*); 10 *Prakirnas* (scriptures which describe independent or miscellaneous subjects of the Jaina religion); six *Cheda Sutras* (subject matter described in these is only for monks and nuns and not for lay people; it relates to the conduct and behaviour of monks and nuns and also explains how they can repent for their sins and mistakes); four *Mula Sutras* (scriptures which are essential for monks and nuns to study in the earlier stages of their monkhood); and a number of individual texts such as the *Nandi Sutra* and *Anuyogadvara*. Believing that all the

original *Angas* have been lost for centuries, the *Digambaras* have a different canon (known as *Siddhanta*). It should be noted that *The Tattvartha-Sutra* contains the main doctrines of Jaina faith, though the two main sects have slightly different versions and composition dates.

Jainas believe that each *Jina* reveals the same essential truths, according to the needs of the society and in the era in which he is born. When he reaches omniscience, he can make the *divya-dhvani* (divine sound), through which he transmits his teachings to all sentient beings (*samavasarana*). The *Digamabara* and *Shvetambara* sects interpret the notion of the divine sound differently. *Digamabara*s consider it to be an unarticulated sound, which is monotone and can be compared to the sound of 'OM'. Whereas, *Shvetambaras* call it 'divine' because all beings can hear it, including five-sensed animals with understanding and spiritual abilities. It is considered to be a human language that takes the form of Ardha-Magadhi Prakrit.

The non-canonical (commentaries on the canonical) Jaina works are partly in Prakrit dialects (such as Maharashtri) and partly in Sanskrit. The Jaina *Puranas* (called *Charitas* by *Shvetambaras*) are the hagiographies of the Jaina saints/*Tirthankaras* (literally meaning 'ford makers', who build fords that help people across the ocean of suffering). The *Adi Purana* compiled in 9th century is the hagiography of Jaina founder Rishabha (Adinatha). The 8th century *Harivamsha Purana* gives a Jaina version of the stories of Krishna, Balarama, Pandavas, and Kauravas, among others. The 9th century Jinasena and Gunabhadra authored *Trishashtilakshana Mahapurana* contains not only life stories of various Jaina saints, kings, and heroes, but also contains discussions on topics like interpretation of dreams, life-cycle rituals, duties of a king and warrior, etc. The 12th century *Parishishtaparvan* by Hemachandra gives details about political history and provides the earliest account of Jaina teachers. Jaina texts include vast collection of lyrical poetry, hymns, and *katha* (didactic story) in different languages like Prakrit, Sanskrit, Apabhramsha, and Kannada. These texts not only offer glimpses of cultural history of that era, but also tell us a great deal about the history and doctrines of Jainism, its rival schools, the *Sangha*'s life, etc. It is rather unfortunate that Jaina texts have not been studied as

extensively as Buddhist texts.

## **Life of Vardhamana Mahavira**

Vardhamana is considered the 24th and last *Tirthankara or Jina* (meaning victor, one who has attained infinite knowledge and now can help others to attain liberation from the cycle of rebirth, i.e., '*Moksha'*). He came to be known as *Mahavira* (great hero). He was also known by the names of Jitendriya (one who has conquered his inner desires) and Arihant (worthy). He possessed *avadhijnana* (superhuman insight and cognition).

**Mahavira**

According to tradition, he was a contemporary of the Buddha and was born in c. 599 BCE at a village named Kundagrama near Vaishali (capital of Videha). Like the Buddha, he was born in a Kshatriya clan. His father

Siddhartha was the chief of the Jnatjriya clan and his mother Trishala was Lichchavi's King Chetaka's sister. His family was connected with the royal family of Magadha, as Chetaka's daughter was married to Bimbisara (Haryanka Dynasty of Magadha). Initially, he led a householder's life, married Yashoda, and had a daughter named Priyadarshana. But, he renounced the world in search of truth at the age of 30 and became an ascetic. He wandered for 12 years, practising severe austerities, fasting, and meditation. At the age of 42, it is believed that on the banks of Rijupalika river, outside the town of Jrimbhikagrama, and in the fields of a householder named Samaga, he attained *kevalajnana* (omniscience or infinite knowledge). He passed away and became a *siddha* (fully liberated) at the age of 72 years in c. 527 BCE at Pavapuri near Patna.

## **Doctrines of Jainism**

The Jaina doctrine is much older than Buddhism and it is accepted that in each half cycle of time there are total 24 Tirthankaras. It is rather interesting to note that the Jaina conception of time is divided into endless sequence of progressive (*utsarpinis*) and regressive half cycles (*avasarpinis*) in terms of degree of happiness. These vast spans of time are further divided into 6 kalas (stages). The first founder Tirthankara Rishabhadeva (symbol – bull), whose reference is also found in Rig Veda and Vayu Purana, belongs to our current half cycle of *avasarpini* (i.e., a period of regressive happiness). The historicity of all the Tirthankaras is not easy to establish. Neminatha belonging to Saurashtra (Gujarat) is believed to be the 22nd Tirthankara, and the 23nd Tirthankara is believed to be Parshvanatha (of Benaras) having the emblem of the snake. The 24th Tirthankara was Mahavira, who had the emblem of the lion.

The core of Jaina doctrine is expressed in the principle of *Anekantavada* (doctrine of manifold nature of reality), *Syadavada* (the theory of conditioned predication), *Nayavada* (theory of partial standpoints), *Triratna* (three gems), *Pancha Mahavrata* (five great vows), and *Ahimsa* (doctrine of non-violence). Opposed to the philosophy of *ekanta* (one-sidedness or solitary attribute), Jaina doctrine of *Anekantavada* is literally the doctrine of 'non-onesidedness' or 'manifoldness' or 'nonabsolutism'. It is one of the basic principles of Jainism that encourages acceptance of relativism and pluralism. According to this doctrine, *truth and reality are perceived differently from different points of view, and no single point of view is the complete truth*. Jainas compare all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with *adhgajanyayah* (the '*maxim of the blind men and elephant*'). In this story, one man felt the trunk, another felt the ears, while the third felt the tail. All the blind men claimed to explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed, due to their narrow perspectives. Jaina doctrine states that objects have infinite modes of existence and qualities, so they cannot be completely grasped in all aspects and manifestations by finite human perception. Only the *Kevalins* — the omniscient beings — can comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations, while all others are capable of only partial knowledge. The doctrine of Syadavada (doctrine of 'may be') emphasises on the relativity of all knowledge. According to this doctrine, all judgments are conditional, holding good only in certain conditions, circumstances, or senses. All that is possible is a number of partially true statements about any reality but the whole reality cannot be determined for certain. Every statement about reality should be prefixed with *syat* (meaning 'may be'). The doctrine of *Nayavada* signifies the system of describing reality from different points of view. '*Naya'* can be understood as partially true statements but they cannot lay claim to absolute validity. '*Naya'* can also be defined as a particular opinion framed with a view-point, a view-point which does not rule out other different view-points, and is, therefore, expressive of a partial truth about an object, as entertained by a knowing agent.

To achieve liberation of the soul, a Jaina must follow the three jewels of Jaina ethics, popularly called *Triratna*. They are:

- a. Right faith (*Samyag darshana*): This does not mean believing what you are told, but means seeing (hearing, feeling, etc.) things properly, and avoiding preconceptions and superstitions that get in the way of seeing clearly.
- b. Right knowledge (*Samyag jnana*): This means having an

accurate and sufficient knowledge of the real universe – this requires a true knowledge of the five (or six) substances and nine truths of the universe – and having that knowledge with the right mental attitude.

c. Right conduct (*Samyag charitra*): This means living one's life according to Jaina ethical rules; to avoid doing harm to living things; and freeing oneself from attachment and other impure attitudes and thoughts.

In order to help attain *Triratna* one must observe *Pancha Mahavrata* (five great vows):

i. Non-violence (*Ahimsa*): Among these five vows, non-violence (*ahimsa*) is the cardinal principle of Jainism, and hence it is known as the cornerstone of Jainism. Non-violence is the supreme religion (*Ahimsa parmo dharma*). According to Jainism, all living beings, irrespective of their size, shape, or different spiritual developments, are equal. No living being has the right to harm, injure, or kill any other living being, including animals, insects, and plants. Jainism recognises four forms of existence – that of gods (*deva*), humans (*manushya*), hell beings (*naraki*), and animals and plants (*tiryancha* who are further divided on the basis of the faculty of sense into smaller sub-categories: *ekendriyas* (single-sense bodies); and *nigodas* (lowest of *ekendriya* having sense of only touch, who are born in clusters and whose lives last only a fraction of a second). The general laity following Jainism is supposed to avoid harming beings with two or more senses, but the monks/renunciants are supposed to refrain from harming even *ekendriyas* and element bodies (*sthavara –* which are slightly higher than *nigodas*). It is more painful if a life of the higher forms (with more than one sense) is killed. Since all nonvegetarian food is made by killing a living being with two or more senses, Jainism preaches strict vegetarianism, and prohibits non-vegetarian foods. In Jainism, it is the intention to harm, the absence of compassion, unawareness, and ignorance that makes an action violent. Violence is not defined by actual

harm, for this may be unintentional. Without violent thought there can be no violent action. Non-violence is to be observed in action, speech, and thought. One should not be violent, ask others to do so, or approve of such an activity. Jainism prohibited the practice of war, and even agriculture for its followers. Eventually Jainas, confined themselves to trade and mercantile activities.

- ii. Truth (*Satya*): Jainism insists that one should not only refrain from falsehood, but should always speak the truth, which should be wholesome and pleasant. One should remain silent if the truth causes pain, hurt, anger, or death of any living being. Anger, greed, fear, and jokes are the breeding grounds of untruth. To speak the truth requires moral courage. Only those who have conquered greed, fear, anger, jealousy, ego, and frivolity can speak the truth. Truth is to be observed in speech, mind, and deed.
- iii. Non-stealing (*Achaurya or Asteya*): Stealing consists of taking another's property without his consent, or by unjust or immoral methods. It does not entitle one to take away a thing, which may be lying unattended or unclaimed. One should observe this vow very strictly, and should not touch even a worthless thing, which does not belong to him. When accepting alms, help, or aid, one should not take more than what is the minimum requirement. To take more than one's need is also considered theft in Jainism.
- iv. Celibacy/Chastity (*Brahmacharya*, added by Mahavira): Total abstinence from sensual pleasure and the pleasure of all five senses is called celibacy. Sensual pleasure is an infatuating force, which sets aside all virtues and reason at the time of indulgence. This vow of controlling sensuality is very difficult to observe in its subtle form. One may refrain from physical indulgence, but may still think of sensual pleasures, which is prohibited in Jainism. Monks are required to observe this vow strictly and completely. They should not enjoy sensual pleasures and pleasure of all five senses. There are several

rules laid down for observing this vow for householders. They should not indulge in any physical relationship other than with one's own spouse, and that too of limited nature.

v. Non-attachment/Non-possession (*Aparigraha*): An attachment to worldly objects results in the bondage to the cycle of birth and death. Therefore, one who desires spiritual liberation should withdraw from all attachments to objects that please any of the five senses. Jainism believes that the more worldly wealth a person possesses, the more he is likely to commit sin to acquire and maintain the possession, and in the long run he may be unhappy. Worldly wealth creates attachment, which will continuously result in greed, jealousy, selfishness, ego, hatred, violence, etc. Mahavira has said that 'wants and desires have no end, and only the sky is the limit for them'.

It should be noted that if these *vratas* or vows are very strictly observed, they are known as *'Mahavratas'*, i.e., great or full vows; and normally these are meant for the ascetics. Laymen, however, cannot observe the vows so strictly and therefore, they are allowed to practice them as far as their conditions permit. The same *vratas* or vows — when partially observed — are termed as *'Anuvratas'*, i.e., small or partial vows. The highest form of death achieved by a person, whether a monk or a layman, involved death by meditating and fasting.

### **Buddhism and Jainism**

Both Buddhism and Jainism had some similarities in their teachings. For instance, both rejected the authority of Vedas, emphasised on renunciation and human effort as the means of obtaining salvation, and established a monastic order for both men and women. Like Buddhism, Jainism is fundamentally atheistic; though it recognises the existence of gods, yet it refuses to give them importance in the universal scheme of themes and places the gods lower than Jina (the conqueror). Like Buddhist texts, Jaina texts criticise the Brahmanas, their practice of animal sacrifices, and ritual authority giving preference to Brahmanas. Both Jainism and Buddhism focus on the superiority of the Kshatriya

*varna* over all other *varnas* including Brahmanas. They both attempted to give a new connotation to the meaning of Brahmana, shifting the emphasis from an ascribed status to one achieved by good deeds. They use the word '*Brahmana*' in the sense of acknowledging a wise person who possesses true knowledge and lives an exemplary life. Like Buddhism monastic order, people of all castes and social backgrounds were welcomed in Jainism. There are frequent mentions of a learned Jaina monk named Harikeshiya who belonged to a *Chandala* family. Brahmana *varna* was represented by Bhadrabahu, Divakara, Jinasena, and Haribhadra. Similarly, Jainism opened its doors to women mendicants who were addressed as *aryika* or *sadhvi*.

### **Spread and Influence of Jainism**

Jainism gradually spread to western India where the Brahmanical religion was weak. The early Jainas adopted Prakrit language of the common people to preach their doctrines and discarded Sanskrit language (which was mainly patronised by the Brahmanas). This greatly helped in widening the follower base of Jainism. And, with the support of kings who greatly patronised Jainism, like Chandragupta Maurya (he himself became a Jaina ascetic and spent his last years in Karnataka), it became popular in southern India too. The great famine that occurred in Magadha after 200 years of the death of Mahavira also contributed to its spread in southern India. According to tradition, the famine lasted for about 12 years; and in order to protect themselves, many Jaina followers under the leadership of Bhadrabahu (who later came to be known as *Digambaras*) went South and spread Jainism there. Around 4th century BCE, it also spread to Kalinga and was greatly popularised by its king Kharavela. In about 2nd and 1st centuries BCE, it reached as far as the southern districts of Tamil Nadu. Later, it penetrated Malwa, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. It is rather interesting to note that even though Jainism did not win as much state patronage as Buddhism, and was not as fast to spread as Buddhism in early times, it still retain its hold in many areas of the Indian sub-continent, whereas Buddhism has practically disappeared from the land of its birth.

AJIVIKAS

Buddhism and Jainism were not the only religions, which challenged Brahmanical dominance. According to the Buddhist sources, more than 62 sects and philosophies flourished in this period. One of these sects,

known as the Ajivikas or 'Followers of the way of life,' were an ascetic order that started at the time of Buddha and Mahavira, and lasted until the 14th century.

Ajivika was founded by Makkhali Gosala. Ajivikas were very popular in Magadha in the third century BCE and Mauryan kings donated several caves in the honour of Ajivika monks. According to tradition, it is believed that for some six years, Mahavira's hardship was shared by Gosala, but ultimately the two quarreled and Gosala left Mahavira to found the sect of the *Ajivikas* (pre-determinism or '*niyati'*). His doctrines and those of his followers are known only from Buddhist and Jaina sources, which state that he was lowborn and died after a quarrel with Mahavira shortly before the Buddha died.

The Ajivikas, who were rigid fatalists and determinists, supposedly held that the affairs of the entire universe were ordered by a cosmic force called *niyati* (meaning 'rule' or 'destiny' in Sanskrit) that determined all events, including an individual's fate, to the last detail and that barred personal efforts to change or accelerate improvement toward one's spiritual destiny. No human effort could have any effect against *niyati*, and therefore *karma* is a fallacy. Nirvana was only reached after living through an immense number of lives, which proceeded automatically like the unwinding of a ball of thread, the last life being as an Ajivika monk. As a result of this static and melancholy view of the human condition, the Ajivikas practiced austerities rather than pursue any purposeful goal. Some later Ajivikas worshipped Gosala as a divinity, and the tenet of *niyati* developed into the doctrine that all change was illusory and that everything was eternally immobile.
