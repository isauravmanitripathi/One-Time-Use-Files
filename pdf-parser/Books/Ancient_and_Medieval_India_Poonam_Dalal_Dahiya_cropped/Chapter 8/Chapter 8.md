# THE GUPTAS AND THE VAKATAKAS (c. 300-600 CE)

As we have discussed earlier, after the fall of the Maurya empire, the Kushans in the North and the Satavahanas in the Deccan emerged as the two major political powers. They not only brought political unity and economic prosperity to these regions, but were also great stabilizing forces in their respective areas. Around c. 230 CE, the Kushans' reign ultimately came to an end in northern India, and a considerable part of its empire came under the suzerainty of the Murundas (possibly kinsmen of the Kushans). The Murundas ruled for a short time span of about 25−30 years. Around the last decades of the 3rd century CE (around 275 CE), a new empire arose on the ruins of the Kushan empire and established its sway over a good part of the former dominions of both the Kushans and the Satavahanas. This was the Gupta empire, which kept northern India politically united for more than a century. The Guptas are believed to be feudatories of the Kushans. They are most likely Vaishyas in origin, and they ruled over fertile parts of the *madhyadesha*, that is, *anuganga* (the middle Gangetic basin), *saketa* (modern Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh), and *magadha* (mostly Bihar). Prayag (modern Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh) was probably their important centre of power, which, due to its strategic location, further aided in the expansion of the empire. The Guptas could easily exploit the iron ore deposits of central India and southern Bihar, and also took advantage of their proximity to the areas of north India which carried on silk trade with the Byzantine empire (Eastern Roman empire). 'Garuda' was probably their state seal. Historians often consider the Gupta period as the 'golden age' of India's past as it is often remembered for certain key classical features, such as the political unification of a large part of the subcontinent under a mostly centralised government, the production of exceptional Sanskrit literary works, sophisticated stone sculpture and architecture, and innovative developments in the field of science and technology. The political history of the Guptas is largely reconstructed on the basis of certain excavated inscriptions and coins.

Gupta Dynasty

Maharaja Gupta/Sri Gupta (Founder of Gupta Dynasty)

Maharaja Ghatotkacha

### Chandragupta – I ( c. 319–335/336 CE)

- First important king of the Gupta Dynasty; laid the foundations of the Gupta empire and claimed the title of *maharajadhiraja* (king of kings).
- Started Gupta era in 319−20 CE, which presumably marks his accession date.
- His empire included parts of modern Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Bengal; with its capital was at Pataliputra.
- Enhanced his power and prestige by marrying Kumaradevi, princess of Lichchhavi clan of Nepal (since the Guptas were probably Vaishyas by caste, marriage into a Kshatriya clan granted legitimacy, prestige, and strength to the Guptas). Coins were struck in the joint names of the Emperor, his queen, and the Lichchhavi nation, thereby acknowledging this marital alliance. In fact, Samudragupta was referred to as *Lichchhavi-dauhitra* (grandson of the Lichchhavis) in the famous *Allahabad prashasti*.

Samudragupta (c.335/336–375 CE)

- Son of Chandragupta I, who followed a policy of war and conquest and enormously enlarged his kingdom. His rule was one of expansion marked first by the conquest of his immediate neighbours and then by campaigns to the east and the south, where chiefdoms and kingdoms were subdued and forced to pay tribute to him. Due to this policy of his, the historian V. A. Smith has called him the 'Napoleon' of India.
- Had a disputed accession to the throne. It is generally

believed that his father had chosen him successor even though he had several elder brothers, which led to a struggle for succession after his father's death. It is presumed that Samudragupta prevailed after subduing his rival, Kachagupta, an obscure prince of the dynasty who was also his brother.

- His achievements are recorded in a long inscription (an eulogy) engraved on the Allahabad pillar (Prayagaprashasti), whose surface also contains inscriptions of Ashoka and later, the Mughal emperor Jahangir. Unlike the Ashokan inscription which stresses on peace and nonviolence, Samudragupta's inscription extolling his deeds and virtues stresses on violence and military conquest, and gives us information about his different conquests. It was composed in pure Sanskrit by Harisena, who was not only his court poet but was also a *kumaramatya*, that is, a high ranking official who described himself by different titles such as *sandhivigrahika* (minister for peace and war) and *mahadandanayaka* (judicial/military officer).
- According to the inscription, *Samudragupta exerted direct or indirect control over much of the Indian subcontinent, stretching from kingdoms in Nepal and the Punjab in the north to the Pallava kingdom at Kanchipuram in the southeast*. The last vestiges of Kushan rule, like the Shakas, the Murundas, and even the faraway independent territory of *Simhala* (present day Sri lanka), accepted his suzerainty as well.
- The *prashasti* divides Samudragupta's opponents into four categories: rulers slain, whose dominions Samudragupta annexed outright; 'frontier' kings, who were forced to pay homage; rulers defeated, but reinstated as tributaries; and 'distant' kings, who acknowledged Samudragupta as an emperor by sending him embassies. He adopted a different policy for each category. In the first category, located in the Ganga-Yamuna doab, he followed a policy of annexation. He defeated nine Naga rulers and incorporated their

kingdoms in the Gupta empire. In the second category, consisting of neighbouring frontier kingdoms and nine republican states of Punjab and western India, Samudragupta's conquests awed the frontier kings into submission and they agreed to pay tribute and taxes to him and obey his orders without any fight. He conquered the *atavika rajyas*, that is, forest kingdoms of central India and forced their rulers into servitude.

- The Vindyan forest kingdoms had a strategic value as they held the key of the route to south India. This enabled him to proceed to the south along the eastern coast, conquering twelve kings on the way and reached as far as Kanchi near present day Chennai. The Prayag *prashasti* mentions the defeat of the twelve south Indian rulers (together) by Samudragupta (including Vishnugopa of Kanchi). It is pertinent to note that Virasena was the commander of Samudragupta during his southern campaign. However, instead of annexing the southern kingdoms, he adopted the policy of political conciliation and reinstated the defeated kings on their thrones. It is generally presumed that this policy was adopted since he knew the limitation of not being able to keep them under control and subservience after returning to his capital in the north. Therefore, it was enough for him that these states recognized his suzerainty and paid him tributes and presents. Lastly, the Shaka satraps of western India and Kushan rulers of northwest India and Afghanistan seem to have paid him homage. The ruler of Ceylon sent an embassy to secure privileges for Sinhalese monks at Bodh Gaya. The inscription adds that *Samudragupta also received tributes from many kings of south-east Asia*. It is generally believed that though he had spread his influence over a vast area, Samudragupta exercised direct administrative control mainly over Indo-Gangetic basin.
- He celebrated his conquests by performing an *ashvamedha* (horse sacrifice) and by issuing *ashvamedha* coins

(portraying the scene of the sacrifice) marking the occasion.

- He was called *Anukampavan* (full of compassion) as he granted permission to the Buddhist king of Ceylon, Meghavarman, to build a monastery and rest house for pilgrims from Ceylon at Bodh Gaya. The magnificence of this monastery was described in the 7th century works of Hieun Tsang/Xuanzang.
- He is depicted on his coins both as a muscular warrior (flaunting his victories on a hundreds battlefields) as well as a poet, a musician, and a patron of learning. He was a great patron of art and adopted the title of Kaviraja (king among poets).
- His love for music is attested by his coins that represent him playing on the veena (lyre) on occasion.
- Legends on his coins include epithets such as *parakramah* (brave), *apratirathah* (invincible), *vyaghra-parakramah* (brave as a tiger), and *ashvamedha-parakramah* (powerful enough to perform the *ashvamedha*).
- Though Hindu by practice, he extended his patronage to other religions, and one of his ministers was the great Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu. Samudragupta is remembered for his patronage of art and literature.

Chandragupta II (c. 376 – 413/15 CE )

- According to some legends, Samudragupta was succeeded by his elder son Ramagupta, but Chandragupta II killed him. It is also believed that during Ramagupta's tenure, the Gupta empire was invaded by a powerful Shaka king. Ramagupta lost the battle and signed a humiliating treaty that allowed his wife to be sent to the enemy camp. It is said that Chandragupta II had to kill his brother and marry his wife, Dhruvadevi, to safeguard the honour of the Gupta dynasty.
- The peak of the territorial expansion of the Gupta empire was reached during Chandragupta II's reign (also known as

Chandragupta Vikramaditya), who extended the limits of his empire by conquests and marital alliances with other royal dynasties of the period. He married Kuberanaga, the Naga princess, and had a daughter, Prabhavati, with her. Prabhavati was married to Rudrasena II of the ruling Vakataka dynasty in Deccan. After the death of her husband, Prabhavati ruled the territory as regent to her minor sons with the help of her father. During this twenty year period, the Vakataka realm was practically a part of the Gupta empire.

- Chandragupta thus exercised indirect control over the Vakataka kingdom, which proved very beneficial to him. With his great influence in this central Indian region, he was able to target his other enemies better. Thus, he conquered western Malwa and Gujarat from the Shaka satraps (one of them was Rudrasimha III) who had been in command in western India for about the past four centuries. This conquest took the expanse of the Gupta empire to the western sea coast, which was an important region for trade and commerce. This contributed to the prosperity of Malwa and its chief city Ujjain, which was also Chandragupta II's second capital.
- An iron pillar inscription at Mehrauli in Delhi indicates that his empire included even north-western India and Bengal. He took the title of *Vikramaditya*, that is, the one who is as powerful as the sun, and *Simhavikrama*.

**Iron Pillar, Mehrauli built during the Gupta age**

– He was the first ruler to issue silver coins. He also issued copper coins and is referred to as *Chandra* on his coins. He also issued gold coins called *dinara*.

![](_page_9_Picture_0.jpeg)

**A Gold Dinar of Chandragupta II**

- The Udaigiri cave inscriptions refer to his *digvijaya*, that is, his conquest of the whole world.
- Fa Hien/Faxian, the famous Chinese traveler, visited India during his reign.
- His court at Ujjain was adorned by nine famous scholars known as the *Navaratnas* ('nine gems'):
  - Kalidasa: Renowned classical Sanskrit poet and playwright of India and a peerless genius whose works such as *Abhijananashakuntalam*, *Malavikagnimitram*, *Vikramorvasiyam* became famous worldwide.
  - Amarasimha: Sanskrit lexicographer and poet, and his 'Amarakosha' is a vocabulary of Sanskrit roots, homonyms, and synonyms. It is also called *Trikanda*, as it has three parts containing around ten thousand words.
  - Varahamihira: Renowned mathematician and astrologer who wrote three important books, the *Panchasiddhantika* (a treatise on mathematical astronomy which is a compendium of *Vedanga Jyotisha* as well as Hellenistic astronomy and summarises five earlier astronomical treatises, namely the *Surya Siddhanta, Romaka Siddhanta, Paulisa Siddhanta,*

*Vasishtha Siddhanta, and Paitamaha Siddhanta*), the *Brihat Samhita* (compilation of wide-ranging topics such as astrology, planetary movements, eclipses, rainfall, clouds, architecture, growth of crops, manufacture of perfume, matrimony, domestic relations, gems, pearls, and rituals, which also provides interesting details of the beliefs of those times), and the *Brihat Jataka* (considered the standard textbook on Vedic astrology).

- Dhanvantri: Physician who is considered the father of Ayurveda (literally meaning 'knowledge for longevity').
- Ghatakarapara : An expert in sculpture and architecture.
- Shanku: An architect who wrote the *Shilpashastra*.
- Kahapanaka: An astrologer who wrote the *Jyothisyashastra*.
- Vararuchi: Grammarian and Sanskrit scholar and the author of the *Prakrit Prakasha*, which is first grammar of the Prakrit language.
- Vetala Bhatta: A magician who wrote the *Mantrashastr*a.

Kumaragupta I (c.415 – 455 CE)

- Adopted the title of *Shakraditya* and *Mahendraditya* and performed ashavmedha sacrifice.
- Founded the Nalanda University (near present day Patna).
- Worshipper of lord *Karttikeya* (son of Lord Shiva).
- During the last years of his reign, peace was disturbed on the north-west frontier due to the invasion of the Huns of Central Asia. In the mid-5th century, the *ye-tha*, known as White Huns (Hepthalites), became powerful in the Oxus valley. After occupying Bactria, the Huns crossed the Hindukush mountains and entered India by occupying Gandhara. Their first attack during his reign was repulsed by prince Skandagupta. The Guptas however could not protect their empire for long and the successive waves of

Hun invasion made the Guptas very weak. This was one of the main factors which accelerated the disintegration of the Gupta empire.

– The Bilsad inscription is the oldest record of his reign and dates to Gupta year 96, which corresponds to 415 CE. Other inscriptions of Kumaragupta's reign are the Karandanda, Mandsor, and Damodar Copper plate inscriptions (the latter mentions that *trade guilds served as banks for advancing loans and receiving deposits in Kumaragupta's reign*).

### Skandagupta (c. 455 – 467 CE)

- Faced and repulsed the Huns successfully.
- Junagarh/Girnar inscription of his reign tells that *his governor Parnadatta got the* Sudarshan lake *repaired*.
- Adopted the title *Vikramaditya*.
- The Gupta empire continued to exist but central control weakened and local governors became feudatory kings with hereditary rights.
- Later Gupta kings included Purugupta, Kumaragupta II, Budhagupta, Narasimhagupta, Kumaragupta III, and Vishnugupta. The Gupta empire declined due to a variety of factors.

# DECLINE OF THE GUPTAS

a. **Hun Invasions**: As we have discussed earlier in this chapter, the Huns' further movement into the Indian territories was successfully repulsed by Skandagupta in the early 5th century. In the latter half of the 5th century, weak successors of Skandagupta could not check growing Hun power and the Hun chief Toramana was able to conquer large parts of western India, stretching up to Eran near Bhopal in central India. Banabhatta in his *Harshcharitra* refers to the Huns invasion. The inscriptions issued by the Huns and numismatic evidence shows that by 485 CE, they had occupied what is present day

Punjab, Rajasthan, Kashmir, eastern Malwa, and a large part of central India. In 515 CE, Toramana was succeeded by his son Mihirkula, who was a tyrant and an iconoclast (Kalhana's *Rajataringini* mentions his cruelty; even Hieun Tsang mentions him as a fierce persecutor of Buddhists) who finally suffered defeat at the hands of Yashodharman of Malwa, Narasimhagupta Baladitya of the Gupta dynasty, and the Maukharis. However, this victory over the Huns could not revive the Gupta Empire.

- b. **Rise of Feudatories:** The Guptas' power was severely curbed by the rise of feudatories. Yashodharman of Malwa, who belonged to Aulikara feudatory family, successfully challenged the authority of the Guptas after defeating Mihirkula, and set up 532 pillars of victory commemorating his conquest of almost the whole of northern India. Even though Yashodharman's rule was short-lived, it did caused a severe damage to the Gupta empire's reputation and image. Motivated and encouraged by these scheme of events, other feudatories too rose in rebellion against the Guptas and gradually declared themselves independent in Bihar, Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Vallabhi, Gujarat, western Malwa, and so on. It is noteworthy that after the reign of Skandagupta, hardly any Gupta coin or inscription is found in western Malwa and Saurashtra.
- c. **Gradual Decline in Economic Prosperity:** The gradual economic decline of the Gupta empire is indicated by the gold coins of later Gupta rulers, which have less of gold content and more of alloy. We also notice a gradual disappearance of coins in the post-Gupta period. It led the kings to make payments in form of land rather than cash. It is evident by the discovery of large scale land grant charters donating land to *brahmana*s and officers. This further aggravated the feudal tendencies of the empire and indicated lesser control on the part of the central government. Also, due to the loss of western India, the rich revenues from foreign trade and commerce also dropped and this further crippled the Guptas. *The migration of a guild of silk*

*weavers from Gujarat to Malwa in 473 CE and their adoption of non- productive professions show that there was probably not much demand of cloth produced by them* (as stated in Mandasor inscription).

The decline of the Gupta empire resulted in the emergence of numerous ruling dynasties in different parts of northern India. Prominent among them were the Pushyabhutis of Thanesar, Maukharies of Kanauj, and the Maitrakas of Valabhi. The political scene in the Peninsular India was no different. The Chalukyas and the Pallavas emerged as strong regional powers in Deccan and northern Tamil Nadu respectively.

## **The Vakatakas of the Deccan**

In peninsular India, especially in northern Maharashtra and Vidarbha, the Satavahanas were succeeded by a local power known as the Vakatakas, who played an effective role in the political game of the Deccan for more than two and a half centuries. The Vakatakas were contemporaneous of the Guptas in northern India. The *Puranas* refer to the dynasty as the *Vindhyakas*. The Vakatakas, who were Brahmin themselves (belonging to the, Vishnuvriddha gotra) were great champions of the Brahmanical religion and performed numerous Vedic sacrifices. Their history can be reconstructed on the basis of a large number of copper-plate land grant charters issued to the *brahmana*s. Even though they promoted Brahminism, they were liberal in outlook and patronised Buddhism as well.

The Vakatakas had matrimonial ties with the imperial Guptas (Rudrasena II of the royal Vakataka family was married to Prabhavatigupta, the daughter of Chandragupta II of the imperial Gupta family), the Nagas of Padmavati, the Kadambas of Karnataka, and the Vishnukundins of Andhra. Culturally, the Vakataka kingdom is important because it became a channel to spread Brahminical culture to southern India. The Vakatakas are noted for having been patrons of the arts, architecture, and literature. Their legacy in terms of public works and monuments has made significant contributions to Indian culture. The rock-cut Buddhist *vihara*s and *chaitya*s of the Ajanta Caves (a

UNESCO World Heritage Site) were built under the patronage of the Vakataka king, Harisena. They are also credited with having built a few temples in Tigwa and Nachanakuthara. They made a remarkable contribution in the field of painting. Ajanta cave numbers XVI, XVII and XIX are the best examples of Vakataka excellence in the field of painting, in particular the painting titled *Mahabhinishkramana*. Not only the Vakataka rulers, but their ministers or governors like Hastibhoja and Varahadeva also extended their benevolent patronage to the Ajanta cave painters. Kings like Pravarasena II (celebrated author of the *Setubandhakavya*) and Sarvasena (author of the *Harivijaya*) were themselves poets of great repute in Prakrit. A style by name *Vaidharbhariti* was developed in Sanskrit during their rule, which was praised by the poets of the likes of Kalidasa, Banabhatta, and Dandin. The Vakatakas had a stamp of their own in their rulership, which is truly unmatched.

### **Vakataka Dynasty**

Vindhyashakti I (last quarter of the 3rd century, around c. 250 – 270 CE)

- Founder of the Vakataka dynasty, who probably ruled from Purika.
- He is credited to have performed a number of Vedic sacrifices and thus revived Brahminical rituals, which were in abeyance during the rule of the later Satavahanas.
- The Ajanta Inscriptions of the time of Harisena describes him as a *dvija* and praises him for his military achievements. It is claimed that *the sun was obscured by the masses of dust raised by his horses' hooves, and he is compared with the gods Puramdara (Indra) and Upendra* (*Vishnu*).

Pravarasena ( c. 270 – 330 CE)

– Vindhayasakti's son and successor, who is considered the founder of the real power and greatness of the Vakatakas. He extended the empire southwards into Vidarbha and adjoining areas of the Deccan, with his capital at Kanchanaka (modern Nachna).

- His son Gautamiputra married the daughter of the Naga king Bhavanaga, which cemented an important political alliance.
- By military exploits and matrimonial alliances, he extended his kingdom from Bundelkhand in the north to Hyderabad in the south, and to commemorate his victories, he performed an *asvamedha* sacrifice and a *vajapeya* sacrifice. He was the only Vakataka king who took the title of *samrat*, while all other kings took the modest title of maharaja.
- After the death of Pravarasena, his four sons divided the empire and ruled independently in separate provinces. Gautamiputra in all likelihood died during the lifetime of his father and hence, his son Rudrasena I succeeded his grandfather Pravarsena to the throne and ruled from Nandivardhana, near modern Nagpur. Sarvasena, another son of Pravarasena, started ruling independently from Vastugulma as his capital, which is identified as modern Bassien in Vidarbha. We do not have adequate knowledge of the two other sons of Pravarasena. By 340 CE, the Vakatakas were divided into two lines, one ruling from Nandivardhana and the other ruling from Vatsagulma.

It is rather interesting to note that in spite of these divisions in the Vakataka kingdom, the contemporary Gupta rulers never attacked the Vakatakas. This may be due to the Guptas' belief that the Vakatakas could be useful to them in defeating the Western Kashtrapas.

### **Nandivardhana Branch**/**Line**

Rudrasena I (c. 340 – 365 CE)

- Founder of the Vakataka Nandivardhana branch, which ruled from Nandivardhana (near Nagpur).
- Since no inscription belonging to his reign is available, not much is known about the events that took place during his reign. He is known to have been a worshipper of Lord *Mahabhairava*, the fierce form of Shiva.

Prithvisena I (c. 365–390 CE)

- Described in later Vakataka inscriptions as a righteous conqueror, he was compared to the epic hero Yudhishthira due to his comparable qualities of truthfulness, transparency, compassion, and humility.
- Padmapura seems to have been an important administrative centre during his time.
- Spent most his time in consolidating his kingdom. The chief feature of his reign is a political alliance between Chandragupta II and himself, and together they defeated the Shaka *satraps* of Malwa and Kathiawar.
- During the later parts of his reign, the Guptas and the Vakatakas entered into a matrimonial alliance since Prithvisena's son Rudrasena II, the crown prince, was married to Prabhavatigupta, the daughter of Chandragupta II.
- Prithivisena also was a Shaiva like his father.

Rudrasena II (c. 390–395 CE)

– Ruled only for a period of five years as he died prematurely, leaving behind three minor sons Divakarasena, Damodarasena, and Pravarasena. His wife Prabhavatigupta ruled as the regent until 410 CE. *Unfortunately*, Divakarasena also died prematurely and did not live long enough to ascend the throne but his younger brothers Damodarasena and Pravavarasena II did. In fact, the seal of Prabhavatigupta's Maregaon plates describes her as the '*mother of two kings*'.

Pravarasena II (c. 395 – 440 CE)

- Largest number of Vakataka inscriptions belong to his reign. A dozen copper-plate grants of his were discovered in different parts of Vidarbha, though Prabhavatigupta continued to issue inscriptions in her own right and died during the later part of her son's reign.
- He is credited with the founding of a new capital at Pravarapura, which is identified as Paunar in the presentday Wardha district.

- Even though he was a devotee of Shiva, he composed a Prakrit *kavya* glorifying Rama, the *Setubandha*/*Ravanavaha*, which is about Rama's journey to Lanka and his victory over Ravana.
- He entered into a matrimonial alliance with the contemporary Kadambas (near Mysore). His son Narendrasena was married to a princess of Kuntala, Ajihata Bhattarika, the daughter of Kakutsavarman of the Kadamba dynasty.

Narendrasena (c. 440 – 460 CE)

- It is believed that after the death of Pravarsena II, a struggle for succession happened in which Narendrasena emerged successful.
- He had to face the invasion of the Nala king, Bhavadottavarman, both in the beginning and at the end of his reign. In between, he made some conquests, and had to face the stiff opposition of the Nalas all along.

Prithivisena II (c. 460 – 480 CE)

- Last known ruler of Nandivardhana branch of the Vakataka dynasty, who is credited with the revival the fallen fortunes of the Vakatakas. His inscriptions refer to his *having twice rescued the sunken fortunes of Vakatakas*.
- He had to face the invasion of Harisena of Vatsagulma line thrice, and the invasion of Bhavadottavarman of the Nala dynasty. He also appears to have fought with the Traikutaka king, Dahrasena of southern Gujarat.
- After Prithivisena II's death, it is presumed that Harisena of the Vatsagulma line of the Vakatakas conquered his successors and united the Nandivardhana line with his own.

### **Vatsagulma Branch**/**Line**

– The second major Vakataka line was the Vatsagulma branch, which had its capital at Vatsagulma (modern Washim in Akola district, Maharashtra). The founder *of the* Vatsagulma line *of the* Vakatakas was Sarvasena, the son of Pravarasena I.

### Sarvasena (c. 330 – 355 CE)

- Adopted the title *dharma-maharaja*.
- Was believed to be a renowned Prakrit poet, and his lost work, the *Harivijaya*, was lauded by later writers. Some of his verses were incorporated into the *Gathasattasai*.

Vindhyashakti II/ Vindhyasena (c. 355 – 400 CE)

- He ruled for almost four decades and his kingdom seems to have included the Marathwada region comprising of the southern part of Vidarbha, the northern part of Hyderabad state, and some other adjoining territories.
- He is believed to have defeated the Kadambas of Banavasi, who ruled over Kuntala (north Karnataka).
- His son and successor Pravarasena II appears to have ruled for a period of fifteen years. Pravarasena II was followed by Devasena, who was a pleasure-seeking ruler, but luckily had the services of a very capable minister, Hasthibhoja. His successor Harisena was the ablest and the greatest ruler of this line.

Harisena (c.475 – 500 CE)

- Last known king of the Vatsagulma line, who not only united the two Vakataka branches but also extended his territories by conquering Kuntala, Avanti, Kalinga, Kosala, Konkan, and Andhra. His kingdom extended from Malwa in the north to southern Maharashtra in the south, and from the Bay of Bengal in the east to the Arabian Sea in the west.
- Dandin, a poet of the 6th century CE, described Harisena as "*powerful, truthful and bountiful, glorious, lofty, and a penetrating critic of ethical and economic compendia*".
- The Thalner copper plates (which record the gifts of villages of bronze workers and goldsmiths) belong to his rein and many of the Ajanta caves were executed during his reign. In one of the inscriptions at cave XVI and the Ghatotkacha cave, there is mention of his minister Varahadeva.

With the death of Harisena II, the glory of the Vakatakas ended and the Nalas, the Kadambas, the Kalachuris, and Yasodharman of Malwa occupied their territory.

# **Various Facets of Life under the Guptas and the Vakatakas**

#### a. **Administrative Organisation**

The king was the focus of administration and Gupta kings adopted pompous titles like *parameshwara*, *maharajadhiraja*, *paramabhattaraka*, *parama-daivata* (the foremost worshipper of gods), and *paramabhagavata* (foremost worshipper of Vasudeva Krishna). The Gupta kings also tried to exalt their status by comparing them with gods. The *Allahabad prashasti* thus which describes Samudragupta as a god dwelling on earth, equal to the gods *Dhanada* (Kuber), *Varuna* (god of the waters), *Indra*, and *Antaka* (Yama), who had no antagonist of equal power in the world.

Unlike the Mauryan period, where the political authority was concentrated in the hands of the king, the Gupta administration was decentralized in nature and contained many feudatories like local kings and smaller chiefs, who ruled over large parts of their empire. These lesser rulers adorned their names with titles like *raja* and *maharaja*. The kingship was normally hereditary but there was an absence of the practice of primogeniture (that is, throne always going to the eldest son). The Gupta bureaucracy was less elaborate as compared to that of the Mauryas. The most important officers under the Guptas were called the *kumaramatyas*, with an office of their own called the *adhikarana*. They were appointed by the king and were possibly paid in cash. All important functionaries like the *mantri* and the *senapati* were recruited from this cadre. Administrative posts were not only hereditary, but often several offices were combined in the hands of the same person. For instance, Harisena, the composer of the *Allahabad pillar inscription* of Samudragupta, was a *mahadandanayaka* (chief judicial officer) as well as a *mahasandhivigrahika* (minister for war and peace), and also the son

of *mahadandanayaka* Dhruvabhuti. Similarly, in the Vakataka empire, both father Hasthibhoja and his son Varahadeva served as ministers under Devasena and Harisena respectively. The hereditary nature of the post naturally weakened the royal control over the administration.

The Gupta empire was divided into provinces known as *deshas*, *rashtra*, or *bhuktis* and their head was called *uparika*. Sometimes, crown princes were also made the viceroys of the provinces. The uparika was appointed directly by the king and he had the authority to appoint the head of the district administration and district town board. The provinces were further divided into a number of districts called *pradeshas* or *vishayas*, which were placed under the charge of *vishayapati*. In eastern India, the vishayas were divided into *vithi*s, which were further divided into villages. The village headman called *gramadhyaksha*/ *gramika* looked after the affairs of the village with the help of village elders. The position of village headman strengthened during Gupta times as no land transactions could be effected without his consent. In the case of the Vakatakas, less information is available about their administrative structure. However, it was very similar to the Guptas. Their empire was also divided into provinces called *rashtras* or *rajyas*, which were administered by governors known as *rajyadhikritas*. The provinces were further divided into *vishayas*, which were again divided into *aharas* and *bhogas*/*bhuktis*. An officer called *sarvadhyaksha* presumably appointed and directed subordinate officers known as *kulaputras*.

Empire Division Structure:

The urban administration included the additional feature of organised professional bodies. For instance, the Damodarpur copper-plates of the reign of Kumaragupta indicates that in the district of Kotivarsha (north Bengal), the *uparika* was assisted in his administrative duties by a corporate council including prominent members of the town — an *adhishthana adhikarana* (a board of five members). These members were: the *uparika*, the *nagara- sreshthin* (chief merchant), *sarthavaha* (chief caravan trader), *prathama-kulika* (chief artisan or merchant) and *prathama-kayastha* (chief in-charge of revenue collection).

The judicial system was far more developed under the Gupta rulers than in earlier times. For the first time, civil and criminal laws were clearly demarcated. Theft and adultery were subjects treated under criminal law. Disputes regarding various types of property formed the body of civil law. Elaborate laws were laid down about inheritance. However, like earlier periods, laws were based on the *varna* hierarchy. The supreme judicial power rested with king and he tried cases with the help

of the *brahmana* priests. There was the office of *mahanadanyaka*, who probably functioned as chief justice. *Uparikas* and *Vishyapatis* in their respective territorial jurisdiction dispensed the judicial function. Interestingly, *the guilds of merchants and artisans were governed by their own laws and capital punishment was not at all given* (as reported by Fa-Hien).

The numerical strength of the Gupta army is not known, but it is accepted that the emperor had a standing army which must have been supplemented by the feudatories' forces in times of need. Thus, military organisation was feudal in character. Suprisingly, the standard term of *senapati* is not found in the Gupta inscriptions though it is mentioned in some Vakataka epigraphs. The commander in chief of the army was known as *mahabaladhikrita*. Horse chariots receded into the background and cavalry came to the forefront in this period. There is mention of the *bhatashvapati* (commander of infantry and cavalry). In case of the Vakatakas, *chhatras* denoted irregular troops while *batas* referred to regular troops who were not only responsible for maintaining

law and order but also extracted revenue due to the state.

#### b. **The Economy**

The Gupta period witnessed an increase in land taxes but a decrease in trade and commerce taxes (such as *shulka* or tolls). The period from c. 4th century to 8th century was a period of agricultural expansion. Due to the practice of granting lands to brahmanas (*brahmadeyas*, *agraharas* or *shasanas*) and to some other officers, vast areas of virgin land were brought under cultivation and major improvements were made in the

existing methods of production (such as use of iron plough shear, irrigation and preservation of cattle wealth) to attain higher yield. The king collected taxes varying from one-fourth to one-sixth of the produce. Two new agricultural taxes that appear in Gupta inscriptions are *uparikara* (probably a tax imposed on temporary tenants) and *udranga* (its exact nature is not clear, but might be water tax or a sort of police tax). There is also mention of *vata-bhuta* tax, which probably refers to cesses for the maintenance of rites performed for the winds and spirits, and *halirakara*, probably plough tax. In addition to these taxes, peasants were also subjected to *vishti* (forced labour) for serving the royal army and officials. Villagers were obliged to provide the royal officials on tour with food grains, items of daily maintenance such as grass for animals, hide for seats, charcoal for cooking, etc. Since most of the administration was managed by the feudatories and beneficiaries, so unlike the Mauryas, the Guptas did not regulate economic activities on a big scale. Vakataka inscriptions mention of *klipta* (purchase tax or sales tax) and *upaklipta* (additional minor tax).

The Gupta and post-Gupta period witnessed a comparative decline in the country's trade and commerce. Till 550 CE, India continued to have some trade with the Eastern Roman empire, to which it exported silk, and spices. Around the sixth century, the Romans learnt the art of rearing silk worms, which adversely affected India's export foreign trade. The Mandasor inscription is testimony to the fact that a guild of silk weavers left their original home at Lata in western Gujarat and migrated to Mandasor, where they gave up their original occupation and took to other professions. The disruption of the north-western trade route by the Huns was another factor for this decline. India tried to make up for the loss by carrying on trade with South-East Asian countries, but it did not help revive the economy substantially. The loss in trade lessened the inflow of gold and silver into the country. It is confirmed by a general scarcity of gold coins after the Guptas. In ancient India, the Guptas issued a large number of gold coins called *dinaras* though the gold content is not as pure as Kushan ones. However, the gold coins of each successive Gupta ruler, after Chandragupta II, contain less gold and more alloy. After the conquest of

the western *satraps* of Gujarat, they issued a large number of silver coins (*rupyaka*s) mainly for local exchange and very few copper coins.

There is frequent mention of artisans, merchants, and guilds in different inscriptions and seals of both Guptas and Vakatakas, which point towards thriving urban crafts and trade. There is also mention of the flourishing conditions and philanthropic activities of guilds. For instance, the Indore plates of the Vakataka king Pravarasena mention of a *vanijaka* (merchant) named *Chandra who bought half of the village that was gifted by the king to the brahmanas*. Other inscriptions mention the construction of temples, shelter homes, assembly houses, and gardens by merchants. In fact, they also took an active part in the town administration during the Gupta period.

c. **Society**

The structure of the society underwent change in the Gupta period. The *brahmana* supremacy not only continued but rather increased in Gupta times, as evident from the large number of land grants to the *brahmanas* not only from the rulers (*brahmadeya*) but from certain categories of other people too. In return of this favour and support, *brahmanas* presented the Gupta kings as possessing attributes of gods and tried to legitimise the position of the Guptas. The Guptas, who were originally *vaishyas*, came to be looked upon as *kshatriyas* by the *brahmanas*. Since the *brahmadeya* land was given along with administrative rights and tax exemptions, it resulted in creation of a new class of *brahmana* landlords. The castes proliferated into numerous sub-castes in this period due to primarily two reasons:

- i. Assimilation of Large Number of Foreigners: A large number of foreigners had been assimilated into the Indian society and each foreigner was assigned a sub-caste.For instance, the various foreign ruling families of pre-Gupta period (of Greek/Scythian origins) were given semi-kshatriya status. Similarly, the Huns who invaded India during the early 5th century were also assimilated in Indian society as one of the 36 Rajput clans.
- ii. Absorption of Tribal Communities into Brahminical Society: With the extension of Brahminical culture in distant and

different areas, a large number of tribal communities were assimilated in the Brahminical social structure of the *varna* system. It is rather interesting to note that *while the foreigners and tribal heads were included as kshatriyas, the ordinary tribals were given the status of shudras*.

The social and economic status of *shudra*s improved during this period. They were now allowed to listen to the *Ramayana*, the *Mahabharata*, and the *Puranas*. They could also perform some domestic rituals that were earlier prohibited for them and could now even worship a new god called Krishna. From the 7th century onwards they were generally represented as agriculturists. Now a distinction was made between shudras and untouchables, the latter being treated lower in status than the *shudras*. The practice of untouchability intensified (especially hatred for *chandalas*). The Chinese traveler Fa-Hien mentions in his memoirs that *the chandalas lived outside the village and had to maintain distance from the upper castes. The chandalas suffered such glaring lack of privilege that whenever they entered towns or market places they would strike a piece of wood to announce their arrival, so that the others might not touch them and get polluted*. In south India, the notion of untouchability seems to have arrived in the late Sangam age. For instance, in a famous text *Acharakkovai*, water touched by a *pulaiya* (untouchable) is seen as unfit for consumption by higher caste people, and even glancing at a *pulaiya* pollutes the upper caste people.

The status of women deteriorated further in the Gupta period. The main reason for the subordination of women was their complete dependence on men for their livelihood. It is rather ironical that the women from two lower *varna*s were free to earn their livelihood, which probably gave them some freedom, but the women from the two upper varnas were even denied this liberty too. The women lacked porperty rights. However, they had full right of their *stridhana* (the presents received by the bride at the time of her marriage). The free representation of females in art suggest that there was no *purdah* system in the society. However, the first evidence of *sati* (immolation of a widow) around c. 510 CE is found in an inscription at Eran in Madhya Pradesh. In the *Harshacharita* of Banabhata, the queen performs *sati* on the death of

her husband, king Prabhakaravardhana. *Dharamshastra* (law books) texts belonging to the period reflect a tendency towards lowering the age of marriage for girls and advocating a celibate and austere life for widows. The Sanskrit *kavya* literature refers to the courtesans as *ganikas*, who were admired for their beauty but could never attain social respectability.

References to slaves are found in the *dharamashastra* texts as well as the *Narada* Smriti, which mentions fifteen types of slaves. These include mainly the prisoners of war reduced to slavery, debt bondsmen, and voluntary enslavement. Slaves are generally referred to as domestic servants or personal attendants.

#### d. **Religion**

The period c. 300–600 CE is often considered as the phase of consolidation of Brahmanical ideology as temple-based sectarian cults became popular and Sanskrit was firmly established as the language of royal inscriptions. In the Gupta period, *smarta* religious practices (practice based on the Smritis) became popular. Sectarian symbols such as the *linga*, *trishula*, *bull*, *Gaja-lakshmi*, *chakra*, and *shankha* (conch shell) appeared on the royal *prashastis*, coins, and seals. Hinduism acquired its present shape Gupta age only.

The Gupta rulers gave patronage to Bhagvatism, which was centred around the worship of Bhagvat or Vishnu and his incarnations. Later, Vishnu came to be identified with Krishna Vasudeva, a legendary hero of the Vrishni tribe who gave the historic sermon of *Bhagvat Gita* in the epic of *Mahabharata*. So Bhagvatism was also identified with Vaishnavism. It put emphasis on *bhakti* (loving devotion) and *ahimsa* (non-killing of animals, which is why it stresses more on vegetarianism) rather than Vedic rituals and sacrifices. The new religion was quite liberal, and assimilated the lower classes in its fold. According to the *Bhagvat Gita*, the chief text of Bhagvatism, whenever there was a social crisis, Vishnu would appear in a human form and save the people. Thus, ten incarnations of Vishnu were envisioned. The *Puranas* were written to popularise the virtues of each one of these incarnations. Thus, by the end of the Gupta period, Mahayana Buddhism was overshadowed by Bhagavatism and Vishnu became a member of the trinity of gods along

with Shiva and Brahma. Idol worship became a common feature and the idols of different incarnations of Vishnu were housed in the temples constructed in the Gupta period. Many festivals also came to be celebrated. Interestingly, some of the Gupta kings proclaimed themselves as *Bhagavatas* (worshippers of Lord Krishna) and Garuda was their emblem, while most of the Vakatakas claimed to be devotees of Shiva and adopted the boar as their emblem. However, both Guptas and Vakatakas claimed to be devotees of Vishnu. There was also an emergence of worship of composite deities such as *Hari-hara*, who is a part Vishnu and part Shiva, and religious syncretism (for instance, the *incorporation of the Buddha as one of the ten Vishnu avatars*). This phase also saw the competitive relationship between various cults, as expressed graphically in the representations of the Devi trampling on the other Hindu gods, or Buddhist deities trampling Hindu ones, mostly Shiva.

![](_page_29_Picture_0.jpeg)

**Hari Hara Badami Caves**

This period also saw a myriad of local cults, beliefs, and practices. The popular devotional worship included worship of stone and terracotta images of various demi-gods and demigoddesses such as *yakshas*, *yakshini*, *nagas*, *gandharvas*, and *apsaras*, but with one major difference. Even though the independent worship of *yakshas* and *nagas* continued (as evident by a *yaksha* temple at Padmavati, Madhya Pradesh, and a *naga* shrine at Cave XVI, Ajanta), the colossal sculptures of these *yakshas* and *nagas* as found in earlier times disappeared and they now appeared more often as subsidiary figures and more as *dvarapalas* (gate keepers of the great gods). This

phenomenon clearly establishes the attempts of the dominant religious traditions to not only establish links with the popular cults but also points towards their efforts to subordinate them.

The Gupta kings were devout Hindus, but they followed a policy of tolerance towards other religious sects. The Chinese pilgrims Fa-Hien and Hiuen Tsang, who came to India during the reign of Chandragupta II and Harsha respectively, clearly give the impression that Buddhism was also flourishing. Though it is also true that Buddhism no longer received royal patronage, and its glory as in the days of Ashoka and Kanishka was nowhere to be found. However, some *stupas* and *viharas* were constructed and Nalanda developed as a great centre of education for Mahayana Buddhism during his time. Students from other countries also came to study in this university. According to Hiuen Tsang, *the revenues of one hundred villages supported it*.

There was also spread of Tantrism in India in this period. As we have discussed earlier, from the 5th century, the *brahmanas* had started receiving land in the tribal areas of Nepal, Assam, Bengal, Orissa, central India, and Deccan. As a consequence, both tribal and Brahminical culture influenced each other. The tribals were assimilated in the Brahminical fold as *shudras*, and simultaneously, the tribal elements came to be assimilated in the *Brahminical* society. The *brahmanas* also adopted their rituals, gods, and goddesses. It is this assimilation of Brahminical religion and tribal practices which resulted in the development of Tantrism. Some general features of Tantrism include the *importance attached to* rituals, yogic practices, terrifying deities, sexual rites, and an emphasis on '*shakti*' (energy), which was conceived to be feminine. The Tantric path was supposed to be a secret one, which was divulged by preceptors to select initiates only, and involved the attainment of supernatural powers and a state of liberation. Certain diagrams known as *yantras*, *mandalas* or *chakras*, and *mudras* (symbolic gestures) play an important role in Tantric rituals. It did not believe in any caste or gender bias and admitted both women and *shudras* in its ranks. The Tantric concepts affected Shaivism and Vaishnavism as well as Buddhism and Jainism. It resulted in the introduction of the worship of female deities in these religions.

#### e. **Literature**

The Gupta period is considered as the Golden Age of art and literature in ancient India. The literature in this period was written in Sanskrit. A huge body of religious and secular literature was compiled in this period. The two great epics, the *Ramayana* and the *Mahabharata*, were finally compiled in the 4th century CE. The stories of both the epics symbolize the victory of good over evil. Both Rama and Krishna came to be considered incarnations of Vishnu. It also marks the beginning of the writing of the *Puranas*. The major Puranas written in this period are the *Vishnu Purana*, *Vayu Purana*, and the *Matsya Purana*. For the worship of Shiva, Shiv Purana was composed, whereas the various incarnations of Vishnu are glorified in the *Varaha Purana*, *Vamana Purana*, and the *Narasimha Purana*. Some Smritis or law books were also compiled in the Gupta period. One of these, the *Narada Smriti* throws light on the general social and economic rules and regulations of the period. Several *dharamashastras* such as *Yajnavalkya*, *Narada*, *Katyayana* and *Brihaspati Smritis* were composed in this period. Kamandaka's *Nitisara*, which is a book on statecraft, and Vatsayayana's *Kamasutra*, which is a treatise on sensual pleasure, belong to this period.

The secular literature gems of this period have greater emphasis on verse as opposed to prose, and the include classic works of the following:

- i. **Kalidasa**: Kalidasa was one of the *navratna*s of Chandragupta II. His works are very famous and have been translated in many European languages. The notable feature of his works include the display of an element of humour, with the characters of higher caste speaking in Sanskrit while those of lower caste and women speaking in Prakrit. Kalidasa invokes Shiva in the beginning of his works and names him Triloknath. Some of his works are:
  - *Meghaduta*
  - *Abhijyanashakuntalam*: Considered a classic and one of the best hundred literary works in the world. It was first translated in English by Charles Wilkins and is one of the

most widely translated works.

- Kumarasambhavam: Story about the birth of Shiva and Parvati's son and also contains references of Sati system
- *Raghuvamsha*: Depicts Vishnu as the origin and the end of the universe.
- *Ritusamhara*: Poem describing the cycle of seasons.
- *Malvikagnimitram*: First Dramatic work of Kalidasa, for the celebration of Vasantutsava (spring festival).
- ii. Shudraka: Writer of the play *Mrichchhkatikam* (Little Clay Cart), which deals with the love affair of a poor brahmana with the beautiful daughter of a courtesan.
- iii. Vishakhadatta: Author of *Mudrarakshasa* and *Devichandraguptam*.
- iv. Bharavi: Writer of a Sanskrit kavya in the 6th century, *Kiratarjuniya*, which describes the combat between Arjuna and Lord Shiva in the guise of a kirata or a mountain-dwelling hunter.
- v. Dandin: Writer of *Kavyadarshana* and *Dasakumaracharita*.
- vi. Amarshima: Author of the Sanskrit lexicon *Amarakosha*.
- vii. Bhasa: Celebrated writer of 13 plays, including *Madhyamavyayoga*, *Duta- Ghatotkacha*, *Dutavakya*, *Balacharita*, and *Charudatta*.
- viii. Bhatti: Author of *Ravanavadha*, which illustrates the rules of grammar while telling the story of Rama's life.
- ix. Vishnusharman: Author of the *Panchatantra*, which is a fine illustration of *nidarshana* (which tells what should and should not be done). It has an elegant prose style and is interspersed witty verses. It was possibly composed in the Vakataka empire and contains satirical tales in which animals play an important role.
- x. Mentha: Author of the *Hayagrivavadha*.

It is rather interesting to note that Sanskrit literature has produced five mahakavyas, all of which belong to Gupta Empire:

- *Raghuvamsham*
- *Kumarasambhavam* by Kalidasa
- *Kiratarjuniyam* by Bharavi
- *Shishupal-vadha* by Magha: Describes the slaying of Shishupala by Krishna.
- *Naisadhiyacharitam* by Sri Harsa: On the life of King Nala and Queen Damayanti.
- f. **Art and Architecture**

Ancient Indian art was mainly inspired by religion. As in earlier times, Buddhism gave a great impetus to art in Gupta period as well. A lifesized bronze image of the Buddha (around 2 metres in height) belonging to the Mathura school has been found from Sultanganj in Bihar. Beautiful images of the Buddha were also created at Mathura and Sarnath. The finest examples of Buddhist art during Gupta period are the paintings of Ajanta caves, which are now included in the list of the World Heritage Sites by the UNESCO. Out of the 28 caves at Ajanta, 23 belong to the Vakataka period, while five caves were excavated during the Satavahana period. Apart from narrative scenes connected with the Buddha, the *bodhisattvas*, and the *Jatakas*, the Ajanta frescos depict religious scenes of *yakshas*, *gandharvas*, *apasaras*, and include scenes from everyday life as well. Surprisingly, these paintings with lustrous colors have not faded even after fourteen centuries. The Bagh cave paintings near Gwalior can be termed Buddhist art as well, and as compared with Ajanta, are more simple and plain.

**Ajanta Caves**

The Gupta period marks beginning of Indian temple architecture, as temples in the form of concrete structures were constructed in northern India for the first time. These temples were made in the architectural style known as *Nagara*, in which generally flat-roofed square temples were built. Two of these temples, in which the images of Vishnu are placed in the centre as a chief deity, are found at Bhitargaon in Kanpur (made of bricks), and the stone sculpture of *Nara Narayana* from the Dashavatara temple at Deogarh in Jhansi. Most of the other surviving stone temples belonging to this era are in a ruined state and are located in the hilly areas of Madhya Pradesh, such as the Vishnu temple of Tigawa and the Parvati temple of Nachna-Kuthara.

**Dashavatara Temple Deogarh**

The sculptures pertaining to period of c. 300 – 600 CE not only show a continuation of earlier styles and trends derived from Mathura and Gandhara schools, but also show introduction of new styles. The inspiration of the themes for sculpture was drawn from Hindu, Buddhist, and Jaina traditions. Many Vaishnava sculptures, which include images of the avatars such as boar, man-lion, dwarf, and Vasudeva-Krishna, have been found at Mathura. One of the largest known free standing stone image belonging to this period is a colossal figure of Krishna effortlessly lifting up Govardhana mountain, found at Varanasi. A stone sculpture of a larger than life figure of a horse (probably representing an *ashavmedha* horse) carved out of beige sandstone found at Khairigarh in Uttar Pradesh too belongs to this period. The cave architecture of this period is almost entirely Buddhist, but there are a few exceptions such as the caves at Udaigiri, near Vidisha, which has the famous relief scene of Vishnu rescuing the earth from the waters in the form of *Nri-Varaha* (body of a man and head of a boar), and Elephanta caves, the largest one of which is dedicated to Shiva. The Buddha images of this period displayed a greater variety of *mudra*s than before. For instance, the Buddha images from Sarnath differed in several ways (as robes have no folds) from those of Mathura. The spectacular Bamiyan Buddha sculptures which were tragically

destroyed by the Taliban too belonged to this period. A dated stone image of a seated *tirthankara* belonging to 432 CE was excavated at Mathura, which was different from the seated figurines of preceding centuries.

#### g. **Science and Technology**

The Gupta period is unparalleled for its achievements in mathematics and astronomy. The roots of Indian mathematics can be traced to the *Shulvasutras*, which were the appendices to the *Shrautasutras*. The *Shulvasutra*s were the manuals for the preparation of the site where Vedic sacrificial rituals were to be performed and they laid the foundations of geometry. The four major *Shulvasutras*, which are mathematically the most significant, are those composed by Baudhayana, Manava, Apastamba, and Katyayana. The Pythagoras theorem and Pythagorean triples' earliest expression can be found in

Baudhayana, which was composed around 600 BCE. The *ganita shastra* (mathematics) was far more advanced as the oldest datable evidence of the decimal place value system can be found in a 3rd century work on astrology called the *Yavanajataka* by Sphujidhvaja (which however, does not mention zero). But an even earlier work, the *Chhandasutra* of *Pingala*, mentions the zero symbol as a dot used in metrics. Varahamihira's *Panchsiddhanta*, which belonged to the Gupta period, is the earliest dateable text to use zero both as a symbol and a number. Some of the notable and eminent personalities belonging to this era are:

- a. **Aryabhatta** I: Father of Algebra and the earliest known astronomer of India, who probably resided at Pataliputra and wrote two astronomical texts called the *Aryabhatiya* (a text which deals with astronomy and mathematics) and *Aryabhatasiddhanta* (which has not survived and is known only through references in later works). For instance, the 7th century commentator, Bhaskara I, who wrote a commentary on Aryabhatiya, calls the Aryabhatiya the *Ashmaka-tantra* and *Ashmakiya*, and the followers of Aryabhatta as *Ashmakiyas*. The *Suryasiddhanta*, which contains sine tables, was also written by *Aryabhatta*. His method of extracting the square root and cube root presupposes the decimal place value of numbers, which certainly shows that Indian mathematicians (started using the decimal system in the 5th century CE) were much ahead of Arabs and Europeans who started using the same in the 12th century after learning from Arabs. Even Arab writers like Ibn Washiya, Al-Masudi, and Al-Biruni give credit for the discovery of the system to the Hindus. Aryabhatta I is noted for:
- i. He was first to discover that the earth rotates on its axis and also worked out the correct equation for calculating the orbit of a planet and gave extremely accurate estimate of the length of a year to 365.2586805 days.
- ii. First astronomer to give a scientific explanation of eclipses as he established that they are not caused by some demons but by

the moon coming between the earth and the sun. He also worked out how to ascertain which part of moon would be obscured during an eclipse.

- iii. He found out the sine functions and used them in astronomy and laid foundations of trigonometry. He also made tables for the trigonometric ratio sine, for angles from 0 to 90 degrees.
- iv. He was the first to invent zero and to recommend the use of the decimal system.
- v. He described the various properties of a circle and gave a very accurate value of pi (π), correct to 4 decimal places at 3.1416.
- vi. He also perfected the methods of solving indeterminate equations in integers problems.
- b. **Varahamihira**: A 6th century astronomer, astrologer, mathematician, and scholar, who was one of the *navratnas* of Chandragupta II and belonged to Avanti. As we have already discussed, his famous work *Panchasiddhantika* summarized five astronomical schools. *Brihatsamhita* is an encyclopaedic work dealing with diverse topics such as how to ascertain the value of precious metals and stones, how to sharpen swords, how to make trees bear fruit out of season, how to distinguish the good breeds of animals, how to foresee the location of water, explanation of seasons, and meteorological issues such as the correlation between the clouds, winds, and amount of rainfall.
- c. **Brahmagupta**: Late 6th/7th century astronomer and wellknown mathematician who made important contributions to geometry. He was the first mathematician to discuss the method of obtaining a cyclic quadrilateral having rational sides and determined the formulae to find the area of a cyclic quadrilateral, the circum diameter of a triangle, and the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral in terms of its sides. He also wrote the *Brahmasputasiddhanta* (628 CE), in which he hinted at the Law of Gravitation, and *Khandakhadyaka* (665 CE), covering such topics as the longitudes of the planets, diurnal

rotation, lunar and solar eclipses, rising and setting of the sun, the moon's crescent, and conjunctions of the planets. He also referred to *svayamvaha yantras* signifying complex automatic devices, which reflects an awareness of the idea of perpetual motion too.

- d. **Mahavira**: A famous 9th century mathematician of Karnataka who lived in the court of the Rashtrakuta king Amoghvarsha, and wrote a book called the *Ganitasarasangraha*, which deals with various mathematical problems. He produced formulae for the area and circumference of an eclipse, though these formulae were later discarded as incorrect.
- e. **Bhaskara II**: Author of the *Lilavati* written in the 12th century, which contains important ideas of calculus.
- f. **Vagbhata:** A disciple of Charaka and distinguished physician of Ayurvedic system of medicine from c. 600 CE. He wrote the *Ashtangahridaya* (meaning 'Heart of Medicine') and the *Ashtangasamgraha* (meaning 'Tome on Medicine').
- g. **Maharishi Palakapya**: He wrote the *Hastyayurveda*, a treatise dealing with the diagnosis and treatment of the major diseases of elephants through medication and surgery.
- h. **Dhanvantri:** He was famous for his knowledge of Ayurveda.
- i. **Kashyapa**: A 7th century physician who compiled his Ayurvedic knowledge in a compendium which dealt with the diseases of women and children.
- j. **Sushruta:** The famous author of the *Sushruta Samhita*, which deals with surgery. It contains six sections, mainly focusing on the treatment of wounds, extraction of splinters and arrows, suturing, embryology, anatomy, poisons, removal of cataracts, removal of stones in the bladder, etc. The text also refers to plastic surgery, with detailed references to rhinoplasty wherein a flap of skin is grafted to repair a severed nose and the repair of torn ear lobes. It also mentions of study of human anatomy by dissecting corpses.

Metallurgy also saw technological advancement in Gupta times. The bronze images of Buddha produced on a considerable scale during this

period are an example of advanced technology. The iron pillar at Mehrauli, Delhi, standing in the open, which has surprisingly not gathered rust even after fifteen centuries, speaks volumes of the iron technology prevailing in the Gupta period. The wonderful paintings of Ajanta, still intact, indicate that the art of making colours was unmatched in this period.
