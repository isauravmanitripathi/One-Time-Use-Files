## THE MUGHALS (c.1526–1857 CE)

The Mughal Empire was founded by Babur, a Central Asian ruler who claimed lineage from Timur (the founder of the Timurid Empire) on his father's side and from Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Chengiz Khan, on his mother's side. It is noteworthy to add that due to the lineage of Timur, the Mughals are also referred as Timurids. In c.1494 CE, Babur, at the meagre age of twelve ascended the throne at Farghana, a small principality in Transoxiana, after the death of his father. The situation in Central Asia was not stable and Babur lost both Farghana and Samarkand to the Uzbeks. Ousted from his ancestral domains in Central Asia, Babur was forced to move towards India. Like countless earlier invaders from Central Asia, Babur too was drawn towards India by the lure of its fabulous wealth.

Babur (c.1526–30 CE)

- Founder of Mughal Empire (descendants of Mongols).
- Worthy descendant of Timur, the Turk (father's side), and Chengiz Khan (mother's side)
- He became the Sultan of Farghana (Afghanistan) at an early age of 12, when his father Sultan Umar Shaikh Mirza died, but he was soon deprived of his kingdom by a distant relative with the aid of Uzbek chief Shibani Khan.
- He established himself first in Kabul (c.1504 CE) and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. He was successful in capturing Bhira (c.1519–1520 CE), Sialkot (c.1520 CE), and Lahore (c.1524 CE) in Punjab. Another reason for Babur coveting the Punjab *pargana*s was the meagre income of Kabul, which was not sufficient to maintain an empire, and his apprehension of an Uzbek attack on Kabul. Thus, he considered India to be a good place to find refuge and develop a suitable base for operations against the Uzbeks. The unstable political situation in India after Sikandar

Lodhi's death further aided in his entry.

- It is believed that he was invited to fight against Ibrahim Lodhi by Daulat Khan Lodhi (Governor of Punjab), Alam Khan (uncle of Ibrahim Lodhi), and Rana Sanga of Mewar.
- The First Battle of Panipat (c.1526 CE): This was one of the decisive battles of Indian history, fought between Ibrahim Lodhi and Babur. Ibrahim Lodhi was defeated and Babur was not only able to take control of Delhi and Agra but also got the rich treasure of Lodhis. Some key aspects of this battle were:
  - Babur's soldiers were less in number (only 12,000 soldiers against Lodhi's troops of 100,000 soldiers) but the organisation of his army was far superior.
  - Great achievement of Babur's military tactics. He effectively applied the Rumi (Ottoman) method of warfare, also known as Tulguma system of warfare, wherein he encircled Ibrahim Lodhi's army from both flanks. From the centre, his cavalry mounted attack with arrows and gun-fires under expert Ottoman gunners Ustad Ali and Mustafa, whereas the trenches and barricades provided adequate defence against the march of the enemy.
  - Babur occupied Delhi and sent his son Humayun to seize Agra. Babur proclaimed himself as the "*Emperor of Hindustan*".
- Victory at Panipat provided Babur a firm ground to consolidate his conquests but at the same time he was faced with new problems:
  - His nobles and commanders were eager to return to Central Asia because they did not like the climate of India. They also felt alienated culturally.
  - The Rajputs were rallying around under the leadership of Rana Sanga, the king of Mewar, and wanted to expel the Mughal forces.
  - The Afghans, though defeated at Panipat, were still a

formidable force in eastern parts of UP, Bihar, and Bengal. They were re-grouping to reclaim their lost powers.

Babur thus convinced his companions and nobles to stay back and help in consolidating the conquered territories. The nobles who were not inclined towards staying back were allowed to go back to Kabul. Even as he succeeded in this difficult task, he found himself inviting the hostilities of Rana Sanga. The Rana had expected Babur to return to Kabul, and his decision to remain in India was a big jolt to Rana Sanga's territorial ambitions. Thus, battle between the two became inevitable.

- Battle of Khanwa (c.1527 CE, near Fatehpur Sikri): One of the most fiercely contested battles in Indian history, fought between Babur and Rana Sanga of Mewar and his allies. Rana Sanga was defeated and Babur's position in the Delhi–Agra region was secured. Some key aspects of this battle were:
  - Rana Sanga of Mewar enjoyed the support of a large number of Rajput chiefs, of which the prominent ones were of Jalore, Sirohi, Dungarpur, and Amber, along with Raja Medini Rai of Chanderi in Malwa, Hasan Khan of Mewat, and Mahmud Lodhi, the younger son of Sikander Lodhi.
  - Babur declared the war against Rana Sanga to be a *jihad* and adopted the tittle of Ghazi after the victory.
- Babur strengthened his position further by conquering the chain of forts in Gwalior, Dholpur, east of Agra, and large parts of Alwar from Hasan Khan Mewati.
- Battle of Chanderi (c.1528 CE): This battle was fought between Babur and Medini Rai, the Rajput ruler of Malwa. In spite of the great valour with which the Rajputs fought, Babur faced little difficulty in overcoming Medini Rai. With his defeat, resistance across Rajputana was completely shattered. Babur had to, however, cut short his plan of further campaigns in the area due to growing

disturbances of the Afghans in eastern Uttar Pradesh.

- Battle of Ghagra (near Bihar, c.1529 CE): This battle was fought between Babur and Mahmud Lodhi (brother of Ibrahim Lodhi, head of the Afghan chiefs, with the support of Nusrat Shah of Bengal). The Afghans had surrendered Delhi, but they were still powerful in the east (Bihar and parts of Jaunpur). Although Babur compelled the Bengal and the Afghan armies to retreat, he could not win a decisive victory. Shortly afterwards, Babur died in c.1530 CE in Agra, while on his way to Kabul. He was buried in Arambagh in Agra, and later his body was taken to Kabul.
- Significance of Babur's Advent into India:
  - Security from External Invasions from North-West Frontier: For the first time after the downfall of the Kushana Empire, Kabul and Gandhar became integral parts of the Mughal Empire. This not only strengthened trans-Asian foreign trade (as these two cities were the starting points for caravans meant for China in the east and the Mediterranean seaports in the west) but also secured the North- West Frontier as they were the staging places for invasions.
  - Established an all-India Empire by breaking the power of the Rajput Confederacy.
  - Introduced new mode of warfare and led to the popularisation of gun powder, cavalry, and artillery in India. Although gunpowder was used earlier too in India, it is Babur who popularised its use.
  - Re-established the authority of the king in Delhi, which had been eroded since the death of Firoz Shah Tughlaq.
- He led by example and was always prepared to share the hardships of his soldiers.
- Though an orthodox Sunni, he was neither bigoted and nor led by religious divines. He was a devoted follower of Naqshbandiya Sufi Khwaja Ubaidullah Ahrar.
- He was deeply learned in Persian and Arabic, and is

regarded as one of the two most famous writers of his mother tongue, Turkish. Indeed he wrote his memoir in Turki called *Tuzuk-i-Babri*/*Babarnama* (translated into Persian by Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khana) and also wrote *Masnavi*.

- He was a keen lover and observer of nature and has described the flora and fauna of India in considerable detail.
- Introduced Char-Baghs and symmetrically laid out gardens with running waters and fountains.
- Built two mosques, one at Panipat and another at Sambhat in Rohilkhand.

Humayun (c.1530–1556 CE)

- Humayun was born to Mahim Begam and Babur and was the eldest son of Babur. 'Humayun' means 'fortune', but he remained the most unfortunate ruler of the Mughal Empire.
- He succeeded Babur at the young age of 23 and had to cope up with number of problems left behind by Babur. The main problems faced by Humayun were:
  - The newly conquered territories and administration was not consolidated and the finances were precarious.
  - Unlike Babur, Humayun did not command the respect and esteem of Mughal nobility. The Chaghatai nobles were not favourably inclined towards him and the Indian nobles, who had joined Babur's service, deserted the Mughals at Humayun's accession.
  - He also had to confront the hostility of the Afghans and other prominent provincial rulers as they were not fully subdued. This included Sher Khan, a powerful Afghan of Bihar, and the provincial ruler of Gujarat, Bahadur Shah.
  - As per the Timurid tradition, Humayun had to share power with his brothers which created multiple centres of power.
    - Kamran – Kabul, Qandahar and Punjab

- Hindal – Alwar and Mewat
- Mirza Aksari – Sambhal
- In c.1532 CE at Daurah, he defeated the Afghan forces which had conquered Bihar and Jaunpur. Then, he besieged the powerful fort of Chunar from the Afghan *sardar* Sher Khan, which commanded the land and the river route between Agra and the east and was thus known as the gateway of eastern India. But in spite of the position of superiority, he made a treaty with rising Afghan leader Sher Khan, *leaving him in full control of area east of Banaras and also the possession of the fort in lieu of his loyalty, a mistake which cost him his empire later*. A probable reason for his this hastiness was the advance of Bahadur Shah of Gujarat towards the Mughal frontiers, specially towards Malwa and Rajputana. In such a situation, Humayun was forced to rush back to Agra (c.1532–33 CE).
- Marching towards Malwa, Humanyun seized Mandu and then stormed Champaner and Ahmedabad. He appointed his younger brother Askari as viceroy of Gujarat and returned to Mandu. However, both Gujarat and Malwa were lost as quickly as they had been gained. Askari lacked experience and when Bahadur Shah moved towards Ahmedabad, he fled to Agra. The only advantage from the Gujarat campaign was that it destroyed forever the threat posed to the Mughals by Bahadur Shah and Humayun could concentrate all his resources against Sher Khan and the Afghans.
- Meanwhile, Sher Khan became the unquestioned master of Bihar. After equipping a new army, Humayun marched against Sher Khan and despite the best efforts by the master gunner, Rumi Khan, it took Humayun 6 months to besiege Chunar. Sher Khan captured the powerful fort of Rohtas by treachery, where he left his family safely and invaded Bengal and captured Gaur, its capital. He then made an offer to Humayun *that he would surrender Bihar and pay*

*an annual tribute of 10 lakh dinars if he was allowed to retain Bengal.* But Humayun declined the offer as he did not want to lose Bengal, which was not only rich but was also a significant foreign trade centre.

- Battle of Chausa (near Buxar, c.1539 CE): Humayun was defeated and Sher Khan adopted the title of Sher Shah. Humayun barely escaped with his life from the battle field, swimming across the river with the help of a water carrier.
- Battle of Bilgrama/Battle of Kannauj (c.1540 CE): After the defeat at Chausa, only the fullest unity among the Timurid princes and the nobles could have saved the Mughals. Humayun reached Agra to negotiate with his brothers. But they were not cooperative, and Humayun could not get support of Kamran who moved out of Agra towards Lahore, leaving Humayun with small force. He thus was not able to prepare properly against Sher Khan. The battle of Kannauj was bitterly contested. Both the younger brothers of Humayun, Askari and Hindal, fought valiantly, but Humayun was still thoroughly defeated by Sher Shah. This battle decided the issue between Sher Shah and the Mughals. Humayun now became a prince without a kingdom and he had to flee from Delhi, becoming an exile for the next fifteen years (c.1540–1555 CE).
- He wandered about in Sindh (c.1540 CE) and its neighbouring regions for next two and half years, trying different schemes to regain his kingdom. He married Hamida Banu Begum (daughter of Hindal's teacher) on his way to Sind. While they stayed at Amarkot, a Hindu kingdom ruled by Rana Prasad, Akbar was born in c.1542 CE. Ultimately, Humayun sought shelter at the court of the Iranian king who forced him to convert to Shia faith (Mughals were otherwise Sunni), and recaptured Gandhar and Kabul with his help in c. 1545 CE.
- In c.1555 CE, following the break-up of the Sur empire, Humayun defeated the Afghans and recovered the Mughal

throne. But before he could consolidate his position, only after six months, he died from a fall from the staircase of his library at Sher Mandal at Delhi in c.1556 CE. For him, it is said that "*he jumbled throughout life and was tumbled out of life*".

- Bairam Khan, one of his faithful officers, helped him come back to India.
- His half-sister, Gulbadan Begum, wrote *Humayun-nama*.
- Humayun built a new city at Delhi which he named Dinapanah, and constructed the Jamali mosque and mosque of Isa Khan at Delhi.
- Humayun's tomb is called the prototype of the Taj Mahal, and was built by his widow Haji Begum.

– Humayun invited two Persian painters, Mir Sayyid Ali and Abdus Samad, and made them his court painters.

# INTERLUDE/SUR INTERREGNUM (c. 1540-1555 CE)

### Sher Shah Suri (c.1486–1545 CE)

- Founder of the Sur dynasty and also the second Afghan Empire (after the Lodhis) whose original name was Farid. He was the son of Hasan Khan, a *jagirdar* of Sasaram in South Bihar (Jaunpur). Later, Farid served under the Afghan governor of Bihar, Bahar Khan Lohani, who gave him the title *Sher Khan* for his bravery (as he killed a tiger).
- He very effectively managed the *jagir* of his father and also acquired great military and administrative skills. He gradually increased his influence and defeated Sultan Mahmud Shah of Bengal (Battle of Surajgarh) and emerged as the most powerful Afghan military commander in the eastern provinces.
- As we have discussed earlier, this brought him in conflict with Mughal emperor Humayun and he adopted the title of Sher Shah after defeating Humayun in the Battle of Chausa, thus declaring himself as an independent king. He defeated Humayun again in the Battle of Kannauj and proclaimed himself as *Emperor of Hindustan* at the age of 54.
- Sher Shah followed Humayun on his flight till Sindh in the north-west. After expelling Humayun, he started consolidating his position in northern and eastern India. He defeated and conquered Malwa in c.1542 CE, which was followed by Chanderi. In Rajasthan he led campaigns against Marwar, Ranthambhore, Nagor, Ajmer, Jodhpur, and Bikaner. He defeated Maldeo in the famous Battle of Samel around Ajmer (c.1544 CE). He defeated rebellious Afghans in Bengal and by c.1545 CE, he had established

himself as the supreme ruler from Sindh and Punjab to the whole of Rajputana in the west and Bengal in the east.

- His last campaign was against Kalinjar (Bundelkhand), in which he succeeded but died from an accidental explosion of gun powder in c.1545 CE.
- Sher Shah, even though a pious Muslim, adopted a tolerant attitude towards other religions. He employed Hindus in important offices.
- He was also a patron of art and architecture and built a new city on the banks of the river Yamuna near Delhi. He built the Purana Qila (Old Fort), Sher Mandal, an octagonal building inside the Purana Qila complex, which later served as the library of Humayun, and his own mausoleum at Sasaram, which is considered as one of the master pieces of Indian architecture. He also built the Rohtas Fort (now a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Pakistan), many structures in the Rohtasgarh Fort in Bihar, and the Sher Shah Suri Masjid, in Patna. He built a new city, Bhera of modern day Pakistan, in c.1545 CE and inside the city built the historical grand Sher Shah Suri Masjid.
- Sher Shah also patronised learned men. Malik Mohammad Jaysi completed his *Padmavat* during his reign. Famous historian, Abbas Khan Sarwani, wrote the *Tarikh-i-Shershahi* during his reign.

He was succeeded by his son Islam Shah (Jalal Khan), who had to face a number of conflicts with his brother Adil Khan, and many Afghan nobles. He died in c.1553 CE and the Afghan empire was substantially weakened. The Sur domains were partitioned among relatives of Sher Shah (Punjab, Agra, Delhi, Bihar and eastern region). For instance, Punjab was taken by Sikander Sur who was later defeated by Humayun. Humayun thus gradually captured his lost kingdom.

Sher Shah's Administration (c.1540–1545 CE)

Although his rule lasted for only five years, he organised a brilliant administrative system which served as inspiration to not only the Mughal administration but to the British too. The empire was divided

into forty seven *sarkars*. Chief *Shiqdar* (law and order) and Chief *Munsif* (judge) were the two officers in charge of the administration in each *sarkar*. Each *sarkar* was divided into several *parganas*. *Shiqdar* (military officer), *Amil* (land revenue), *Fotedar* (treasurer), and *Karkuns* (accountants) were in charge of the administration of each *pargana*. *Mauza* (village) was lowest level of administration.

There were also many administrative units called *iqtas*. The government was highly centralised and consisted of several departments. The king was assisted by four important ministers:

- 1. Diwan-i- Wizarat – Also called Wazir, in charge of Revenue and Finance.
- 2. Diwan-i-Ariz – In charge of the Army.
- 3. Diwan-i-Rasalat – Foreign Minister
- 4. Diwan-i-Insha – Minister for Communications.

The land revenue administration was very well organised and revenue officers were called *Amils* while *Qanungo* were the officials in charge of maintaining revenue records. She Shah for the first time introduced a schedule of crop rates (*ray*). He improved land revenue system by adopting *Zabti-i-har-sal* (land assessment every year) and classified all cultivable lands into three heads (good, middle, bad). *Amils* used to oversee the measurement of land under cultivation for determining state share. The state's share was one third of the average produce and it was paid in cash or crop. Land was measured using Sikandari *gaz* (32 points). Sher Shah introduced two documents:

- a. *Patta* (amount each peasant had to pay)
- b. *Qabuliyat* (Deed of agreement).

Sher Shah also introduced new copper coins called *Dam* and it is interesting to note that they were in circulation till c.1835 CE. He was also the first ruler to introduce silver *Rupayia* (1 *Rupayia* = 64 *dams*) and gold coin (*Ashrafi*/*Mohur*). It is pertinent to note that while the term *Rupayia* had previously been used as a generic term for any silver coin, during his rule the term '*Rupayia*' came to be used as the name for a silver coin of a standard weight of 178 grains, which was the precursor of the modern rupee. Similarly, gold coins weighed 169 grains.

Sher Shah also improved the communications by building roads, called

arteries of the empire. He laid four important highways. They were:

- 1. Sonargaon to Sind: He restored the old imperial road (the Grant Trunk road by Ashoka) and also restored the *Uttarapatha* which connected Tamralipti (Bengal) to Purushpur (Peshawar).
- 2. Agra to Burhampur.
- 3. Jodhpur to Chittor.
- 4. Lahore to Multan.

He built *sarais* (rest houses) at the distance of every two *kos*, i.e., eight kms on the highways for the convenience of the travellers. These *sarais* were fortified lodging or inns where travellers could pass the night and also keep their goods in safe custody. Every *Sarai* had several watchmen under the control of a *shahna* (custodian). One of the foremost contributions of Sher Shah was his re-establishment of law and order across the empire. Police was efficiently reorganised and crime was less during his regime. He dealt sternly with robbers and *dacoits*, and with *zamindars* who refused to pay land revenue or disobeyed the orders of the government. Many of the *sarais* developed into market towns (*qasbas*) to which peasants flocked to sell their produce and these *sarais* were also used as stages for the news service or *dak-chowki*.

Sher Shah also introduced other reforms to promote growth of trade and commerce. For instance, in his entire empire, goods paid customs duty only at two places: goods produced in Bengal or imported from outside paid customs duty at the border of Bengal and Bihar at Sikrigali, and goods coming from West and Central Asia paid customs duty at the Indus. It is noteworthy to add that no one was allowed to levy customs at roads, ferries, or towns, or anywhere else. The duty was paid a second time at the time of sale. He directed his *amirs* to compel the people to treat merchants and travellers well in every way, and not to harm them at all. If a merchant died, they were not to seize his goods as if they were unowned. In fact, he made the local village headmen (*muqaddams*) and *zamindars* responsible for any loss that the merchant suffered on the roads.

The military administration was also efficiently reorganised and Sher Shah revived Alauddin's *Chehra* and *Dagh* system. He personally

supervised recruitment of soldiers and paid them directly. He divided the army into *sawars* (serving as linchpin of entire organisation), elephants and frontmen. He maintained his personal royal force called *Khasa Kail*.

He placed considerable emphasis on justice and considered *justice to be the most excellent of the religious rites*. He did not spare oppressors, whether they were high nobles, men of his own tribe or near relatives. *Qazis* were appointed at different places for justice and village *panchayats* and *zamindars* dealt with civil and criminal cases at the local level. In fact, his son Islam Shah took a big step towards dispensation of justice as he codified the laws.

Akbar (c.1556–1605 CE)

- One of the greatest monarchs of the Mughal dynasty, who was the son of Humayun and Hamida Banu Begam, born at Amarkot in c.1542 CE. When Humayun fled to Iran, young Akbar was captured by his uncle Kamran, but he treated him well. Akbar was re-united with his parents after the capture of Qandahar. When Humayun died, Akbar was at Kalanaur in the Punjab, commanding operations against the Afghan rebels there. He was thus crowned at Kalanaur (Punjab) in c.1556 CE, at the age of 13 years by Bairam Khan.
- Regency period of Bairam Khan (c. 1556–60 CE): Bairam Khan was Humayun's favourite officer and confidante, who served as Akbar's tutor as well as regent (*wazir*) of the kingdom with the title of *Khan-i- Khanan*, remaining at the helm of affairs of the Mughal Empire.
  - Bairam Khan represented Akbar in the Second battle of Panipat (c.1556 CE) with Hemu Vikramaditya (Wazir of Mohd. Shah Adil of Bengal) who led the Afghan forces who were posing a serious threat to the Mughal Empire.
  - Under guidance of Bairam Khan, the Mughals won a series of battles in quick succession and warded off other Afghan contenders like Sikander Sur. They captured Lahore, Multan, Ajmer, vanquished Ibrahim

Sur and annexed Jaunpur, besides laying a successful siege to Gwalior fort, also under Afghan control.

- During this phase, Bairam Khan emerged as the most powerful noble and started appointing his own supporters on important positions neglecting the old nobles. This caused resentment among other nobles who managed to influence Akbar as well. The problem was further aggravated by the growing arrogance of Bairam Khan. By now, weary of Bairam Khan's tutelage, Akbar also wanted to assume full control. He thus removed Bairam Khan, who revolted but was forced to submit. Akbar received him cordially, and gave him the option of serving at the court or anywhere outside it, or retiring to Mecca. He decided to go to Mecca but was assassinated at Patan near Ahmedabad by an Afghan who bore him a personal grudge. Bairam's wife and his son were brought to Agra. Akbar married his widow and took his infant son under his protection. His son later on became famous as the noted Hindi poet Abdur Rahim Khan-i- Khana, an influential noble under Akbar.
- Rebellion from Nobility: During Bairam Khan's rebellion, groups and individuals in the nobility had become politically active. They included Akbar's foster mother, Maham Anaga, and her relatives, especially her son, Adham Khan. In c.1561 CE, Adham Khan was victorious at Malwa by defeating Baz Bahadur (an accomplished magicion and poet). The Malwa queen Rupamati preferred to take her life than become a Mughal captive. Adham Khan followed his victory at Malwa with almost total massacre of the defending army, women, and children, and sent only parts of the booty to Akbar. Removed from the command, he laid claim to the post of *wazir*, and when this was not conceded, he stabbed the acting *wazir* in his office. Furious at his impropriety, Akbar had him thrown down

from the Agra fort.

- Similarly, between c.1561 and 1567 CE, Akbar was engulfed by serious challenge from his Uzbek (central Asian) nobles who broke out in rebellion several times. Many of them traced their descent from Uzbek chief who had driven Babur out of Samarkand and had come to India with Humayun. Uzbeks declared Mirza Hakim, governor of Kabul (his half brother), as the emperor of Hindustan. A group of Timurid nobles, called *Mirzas*, also turned against the emperor. This was perhaps the most serious crisis Akbar had to face since Hemu's capture of Delhi. However, by sheer grit and determination along with a certain amount of luck, Akbar was able to overcome these multiple threats. Mirza Hakim was forced to withdraw to Kabul and the Mirzas were duly suppressed, while the Uzbeks were completely routed by c.1567 CE.
- Early Expansion of Empire (c.1560–1576 CE): He conquered northern India from Agra to Gujarat and then from Agra to Bengal. He strengthened the North-West Frontier. Later, he went to the Deccan.
- Conquest of Gwalior, Malwa, and Gondwana: Akbar started his policy of expansion with central India. In c.1559–60 CE, the first expedition was sent to capture Gwalior before moving towards Malwa. As we have discussed above, in c.1561 CE the Malwa ruler Baz Bahadur was defeated by Adham Khan, who fled towards Burhanpur. However, due to senseless cruelties of Adham Khan and his successor, there was a reaction against the Mughals which enabled Baz Bahadur to recover Malwa. After dealing with Bairam Khan's rebellion, Akbar sent another expedition to Malwa. Baz Bahadur had to flee, and for some time he took shelter with the Rana of Mewar. After wandering about from one area to another, he finally surrendered at Akbar's court and was enrolled as a Mughal

*mansabdar*. Thus, Malwa came under Mughal authority.

- The kingdom of Gondwana (Garh-Katanga) included the Narmada valley and the northern portions of Madhya Pradesh and a number of Gond and Rajput principalities. It was an independent state in Central India ruled by Rani Durgavati, the Chandella princess from Mahoba, and the widow of Dalpat Shah, son of Sangram Shah. In c.1564 CE, Asaf Khan, the Mughal governor of Allahabad, aroused by the stories of the fabulous wealth and beauty of the Rani attacked Gondwana. The Rani fought gallantly but lost the battle. She stabbed herself to death and Gondwana was annexed to the Mughal empire. Akbar later restored the kingdom to Chandra Shah, the younger son of Sangram Shah.
- Conquest of Rajasthan: It seems that Akbar was fully aware of the importance of Rajput kingdoms and wanted them as allies in his ambition of establishing a large empire. He tried to win over the Rajputs wherever possible and inducted them into Mughal service. He also entered into matrimonial alliances with the Rajput rulers. For instance, *Raja Bharmal of Amber married his eldest daughter Jodha Bai to Akbar and Raja Bhar Mal himself, his son Bhagwan Das, and grandson Man Singh joined the imperial Mughal service*. Akbar's military conquests were extensive.
  - The Rajput kingdoms like Merta and Jodhpur were occupied without much resistance.
  - Siege of Chittor (Mewar): A major step in his campaign against the Rajput states was the siege of Chittor, which held not only key to central Rajasthan but above all, it was a symbol of the Rajput spirit of resistance. In c.1568 CE, Chittor fell after a gallant siege of six months. At the advice of his nobles, Rana Udai Singh retired to the hills, leaving the famous warriors, Jaimal and Patta, in charge of the fort. A large number of

Rajput soldiers were killed in the war. However, it could not be fully subdued and some resistance from Mewar side continued for a long time. Later, Maharana Pratap, the ruler of Mewar, posed the most serious challenge to the Mughal emperor and did not submit before Akbar. In the famous Battle of Haldighati (c.1576 CE), Rana Pratap was defeated by the Mughal army led by Man Singh.

- Following the defeat of Mewar, most of the leading Rajput rulers accepted Akbar's suzerainty. After the fall of Chittor, Ranthambhor (c.1569 CE) and Kalinjar were captured. In c.1570 CE, Marwar, Bikaner, and Jaisalmer also submitted to Akbar. Thus by c.1570 CE, Akbar had captured almost the whole of Rajasthan.
- One of most notable achievements of Akbar was that, in spite of the subjugation of the whole of Rajasthan, there was no hostility between the Rajputs and the Mughals. Akbar's Rajput policy was combined with a broad religious tolerance. He abolished the pilgrim tax (c.1563 CE) and later the *jiziya* (c.1564 CE). He also prohibited forcible conversion of prisoners of war. It is noteworthy to add that the Rajput policy of Akbar proved to be beneficial to the Mughal state as well as to the Rajputs. The alliance on one hand secured the services of the bravest warriors to the Mughals whereas on the other hand, it ensured peace in Rajasthan and many Rajput *mansabdars* were assigned their own territories as *Watan Jagir*, which was hereditary and non-transferable. They also rose to important positions in Mughal services.
- Conquest of Gujarat, Bihar and Bengal: Gujarat had been in a sorry state of affairs since the death of Bahadur Shah. Moreover, the Mirzas who had failed in their rebellion near Delhi had taken shelter in Gujarat. Akbar was not prepared for such a rich province to become a rival centre of power.

In c.1572 CE, Akbar advanced on Ahmedabad via Ajmer and defeated the Gujarat ruler Muzaffar Shah without any serious resistance. It was in order to commemorate the victory of Gujarat that Akbar built the Buland Darwaza at Fatehpur Sikri. Surat, with a strong fortress, offered some resistance but was also captured. In a short time, most of the principalities of Gujarat were brought under his control. Akbar organised Gujarat into a province and placed it under Mirza Aziz Koka and returned to capital. However, just within six months various rebellious groups came together under Ikhitiyar ul Mulk and Mohammad Hussain Mirza and revolted against the Mughal rule. As a result, the Mughal governor had to cede a number of territories. Hearing the news, Akbar marched out of Agra at a rapid pace along with a few soldiers and managed to reach Ahmedabad in just 10 days. He quickly suppressed the rebellion in c.1573 CE. After this, Akbar turned his attention to Bengal.

- Bihar and Bengal: The Afghans continued to dominate Bihar and Bengal. They had also overrun Orissa and killed its ruler. Internal fights among the Afghans, and the declaration of independence by the new ruler Daud Khan, gave Akbar the opportunity he was seeking. In c.1574 CE, Akbar along with Khan-i-Khanan Munaim Khan, marched towards Bihar. In a short time, he captured Hajipur, Patna, and Gaur (Bengal). Daud was forced to sue for peace but he soon rose in rebellion again. In a stiff battle in Bihar in c.1576 CE, Daud Khan was defeated and executed on the spot. With this, the independent rule of Bengal was ended.
- Rebellions and Further Expansion of the Mughal Empire: Around c.1580–1581 CE, a series of conflicts arose in some regions of the Mughal empire particularly in Bengal, Bihar, Gujarat and the northwest. The Afghans were at the root of these problems since they were overthrown everywhere by the Mughals. Apart from this, Akbar's policy of strict

administration of *jagirs* including *strict enforcement of the dagh system or branding of horses and strict accounting of their income was also responsible for this*. This created dissatisfaction, and this discontentment was further fanned by some religious divines too who were unhappy at Akbar's liberal views, and at his policy of resuming the large revenue-free grants of lands which had been obtained by them, sometimes illegally.

- Due to the mishandling of the situation by local officers, Bengal and almost the whole of Bihar passed into the hands of the rebels. The rebels under leadership of Masum Khan Kabuli, Roshan Beg, Mirza Sharfuddin, and Arab Bahadur declared Akbar's brother Mirza Hakim, who was in Kabul, as their king. Akbar immediately sent a large force under Raja Todar Mal and Shaikh Farid Bakshi and soon the Mughal forces were able to successfully crush the rebellion in Bihar, Bengal, and adjoining regions. Raja Man Singh and Bhagwan Das offered stout defence to Mirza Hakim's attack on Lahore. Akbar crowned his success by marching to Kabul (c.1581 CE), the first time an Indian ruler had entered this historic town. Akbar gave the charge of Kabul to his sister Bakhtunnisa Begum and later on, Raja Man Singh was appointed governor of Kabul and Kabul was handed given to him as *jagir*.
- Punjab and North West: In c.1584 CE, the hereditary enemy of the Mughals, Abdullah Khan Uzbek overran Badakhshan which was being ruled by Timurid princes and it posed danger to Kabul too. Both Mirza Hakim and the Timurid princes ousted from Badakhshan now appealed to Akbar for help. Akbar immediately ordered Man Singh to march to Kabul, and he himself moved to Attok on the river Indus. In order to block all roads to the Uzbeks, he sent expeditions against Kashmir (c.1586 CE) and against Baluchistan. The whole of

Kashmir, including Ladakh and Baltistan (including Tibet Khurd and Buzurg), came under Mughal domination.

- Expeditions were also sent to clear the Khyber Pass, which had been blocked by rebellious tribesmen of *Roshanai*. *Roshanai* was a sect having a large following, which was established by a soldier called Pir Roshanai. His son Jalala was the head of the sect. Akbar gave the duty of suppressing the *Roshanais* to Zain Khan along with Sayid Khan Gakhar and Raja Birbal. In one of these expeditions, Akbar's favourite, Birbal, lost his life. Akbar deputed Raja Todar Mal and Raja Man Singh to suppress the rebellion and they forced the Roshanais to submit.
- In c.1590 CE, Akbar appointed Khan-i-Khanan as the governor of Multan, giving him the responsibility of subduing Bilochis, a tribe in the Sindh region, and to conquer the whole territory. Finally, by c.1595 CE, Mughal supremacy was established over the northwest region. In fact, Akbar stayed at Lahore till c.1598 CE when the death of Abdullah Uzbek finally removed the threat of Uzbeks. The consolidation of the north-west and fixing a frontier of the empire were two of the major contributions of Akbar.
- Eastern, Western India and Deccan: After settling the affairs of the north-west, Akbar turned his attention towards the affairs of eastern and western India and the Deccan. In c.1592 CE, the Mughal *mansabdar* Raja Man Singh brought the whole of Orissa, Cooch Bihar, and parts of east Bengal, including Dacca, under the Mughal rule. Mirza Aziz Koka, the foster brother of Akbar, conquered Kathiawar in the west. In c.1591 CE, Akbar adopted a policy of aggression towards Deccan and dispatched an expedition to Ahmednagar under the command of Prince Murad and Abdul Rahim Khan

Khanan. In c.1595 CE, the Mughal forces invaded Ahmednagar and Chand Bibi (the deceased Sultan's sister) was defeated. After heavy losses on both sides, a treaty was worked out and Chand Bibi ceded Berar to Mughals. After some time, Chand Bibi attacked Berar to take it back with support from Adilshahi and Qutabshahi. The Mughals suffered heavy losses but could retain their position. Meanwhile, serious differences between Murad and Abdul Rahim Khan Khanan weakened the Mughal position. Akbar, therefore, recalled Khan Khanan and deputed Abul Fazl to Deccan. After Prince Murad's death in c.1598 CE, Prince Daniyal and Khan Khanan were sent to Deccan and Ahmednagar was again captured. Soon, Mughals also conquered Asirgarh and adjoining regions bringing them into direct conflict with the Marathas.

- In c.1605 CE, Akbar died of dysentery and was buried at Sikandra.
- Akbar was not liked for his political ideology by Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi (Sufi leader).
- Art and Architecture: During the reign of Akbar, many indigenous art styles were encouraged leading to the common use of sandstone, the use of arches (mainly in a decorative form) and the decoration that comprised mainly of boldly carved or inlaid patterns complemented by brightly coloured patterns on the interiors. He built the Agra fort in red sandstone. His other forts are at Lahore and Allahabad.
  - He built Fatehpur Sikri (city of victory) near Agra, and a palace-cum-fort complex in it. Many buildings in Gujarati and Bengali styles are found in this complex. The most magnificent building in it is the Jama Masjid and the gateway to it called Buland Darwaza (the Lofty Gate), the height of which is 176 ft. It was built in c.1572 CE to commemorate Akbar's victory over Gujarat. Other important buildings at Fatehpur Sikri are Jodha Bai's palace, the Panch Mahal with

five storeys built in the plan of a Buddhist Vihara, the *Diwani-Khas*, the *Diwan-i-Aam*, and Sheikh Salim Chisti's tomb.

- Built his own tomb at Sikandra (near Agra), which was completed by Jahangir.
- Built the temple of Govindadeva at Vrindavan.
- Built the Jahangiri Mahal in Agra fort, according to Hindu design based on Man Mandir.

**Agra Fort**

- Akbar commissioned the illustrations of several literary and religious texts. Illustrations of Persian versions of *Mahabharata* and *Ramayana* were produced in miniature form. Many other Indian fables became the miniature paintings in the art studio established by Akbar. Historical works such as the *Akbar Nama* also remained the main themes of Mughal paintings. One of the most important works, *Hamznama*, which consisted of 1200 paintings, belonged to his reign.
- He organised painting in imperial *karkhanas* and also introduced European style. Indian colours such as peacock blue, Indian red began to be used. He invited a large number of painters from different parts of the country to his court. Both Hindus and Muslims joined in this work. Mir Sayyid Ali, Abdal Samad, Farukh Beg, Bhusrau Kuli, Miskina, Jamshed Basawan, and Daswant (painted *Razim Namah*, the Persian *Mahabharata*) were the prominent painters.
- Persian language became widespread in the Mughal Empire by the time of Akbar's reign. Apart from Abul Fazl and his brother Abul Faizi, Abdul Qadir Badauni (who wrote *Kitabul-Tawarikh*), Khwaja Nizamuddin Ahmad Harami (who

wrote *Tabaquat-i-Akbari Tarikh Alfi*), Muntakhab ul-Akbari, Utbi, and Naziri (leading Persian poets) were present at Akbar's court. From the time of Akbar, Hindi poets were attached to the Mughal court. The most influential Hindi poet was Tulsidas, who wrote the Hindi version of the Ramayana, the *Ramcharitmanas*.

## ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM UNDER THE AKBAR

## **Organisation of Government**

The Mughals retained many features of the administrative system of the Sultanate and Sher Shah Suri's administration. The administration was highly centralised and the territories of the empire were divided into *Jagir*, *Khalisa* (income went directly to the royal exchequer), and *Inam* (lands allowed to learned and religious men).

## **Central Administration**

### (i) The Emperor

The Emperor was the supreme head of the administration and controlled all military and judicial powers. All officers in Mughal administration owed their power and position to the Emperor. The Emperor had authority to appoint, promote, and remove officials at his pleasure.

### (ii) Wazir

The position of the *wazir* was revived under the Mughals under whom various heads of departments functioned. He was the principal link between the ruler and the administration. Babur's and Humayun's *wazir*

enjoyed great powers. The period during which Bairam Khan (c.1556– 60 CE) was regent of Akbar, saw the rise of the *wakil-wazir* with unlimited powers. Akbar reorganised the central machinery of administration on the basis of the division of power between various departments, and of checks and balances. In his determination to curb the powers of the *wazir*, he took away the financial powers from him, which was a big jolt to the *wazir*'s power. While the post of *wakil* was not abolished, it was stripped of all power and became largely decorative. This post was given to important nobles from time to time, but they played little part in administration. Thus, the head of the revenue department continued to be *wazir*, but he was no longer the principal adviser to the ruler, but an expert in revenue affairs having title of *diwan* or diwan-i-ala. The *diwan* used to inspect all transaction and payments in all departments and supervised the provincial *diwans*.

### (iii) Mir Bakshi

The head of the military administration was Mir Bakshi who was also considered as head of the nobility. Recommendations for appointment to *mansabs* or for promotions were made to the emperor after duly endorsed by him only. Once the emperor accepted the recommendation, it was sent to the *diwan* for confirmation and for assigning a *jagir* to the appointee.

The Mir Bakshi was also the head of the intelligence and information agencies of the empire. *Barids* (intelligence officers) and *Waqia-navis* (news reporters) were posted to all the parts of the empire. Their reports were presented to the emperor at the court through Mir Bakshi. He kept a strict watch over proper maintenance of the sanctioned size of armed contingents and war equipage by the *mansabdars*.

#### (iv) Mir Saman

The Mir Saman was the officer in-charge of the royal household and royal *karkhanas*. He was responsible for all kinds of purchases, manufacturing of different articles for the use, and their storage for the royal household. Only nobles who enjoyed the complete confidence of the emperor were appointed to this office. The maintenance of etiquette at the court, the control of the royal body guard, etc., were all under his supervision.

### (v) Chief Qazi/Sadr-us Sudur

The judicial department was headed by the chief *qazi*. This post was sometimes combined with that of the *Sadr-us Sudur* (Chief *Sadar*) was the head of the ecclesiastical department. His chief duty was to protect the laws of the Shariat and he was also responsible for all charitable and religious endowments. Interestingly, the chief *qazi* during Akbar's reign Abdun Nabi was accused of corruption. However, the promulgation of *Mahzar* in c.1580 CE severely restricted his authority as according to *Mahzar*, *Akbar's view was to prevail in case of conflicting views among religious scholars*. Later, several restrictions were placed on the authority of the *Sadar* for award of revenue free grants also. Two striking features of *Inam* grants were:

a) Akbar granted *inam* lands to all persons, irrespective of their religious faith and beliefs. As a matter of fact, *Sanads* of grant to various Hindu *maths* made by Akbar are still preserved.

b) Akbar made it a rule that half of the *inam* land should consist of cultivable wasteland. Thus, the *inam* holders were encouraged to extend cultivation.

*Muhtasibs* (censors of public morals) were also appointed to ensure the general observance of the rules of morality. He also used to examine weights and measures and enforce fair prices, etc. It is pertinent to note that the doors of the nobility were open to everyone, whether Turks, Afghans, Persians, Hindustani, or Shaikhzadas (Indian Muslims), or Hindu Rajputs, and due to extremely high salaries of Mughal nobles, there was a brain drain in reverse as India attracted many talented persons from foreign lands to the Mughal court.

### **Provincial Administration**

The Mughal empire was divided into twelve *subas* or provinces by Akbar. These were Allahabad, Agra, Awadh, Ajmer, Ahmedabad, Bihar, Bengal, Delhi, Kabul, Lahore, Malwa, and Multan. Later on Ahmednagar, Berar, and Khandesh were added. With the expansion of Mughal empire, the number of provinces increased to twenty. The empire was divided into:

#### **Suba**

Each *suba* was placed under a *Subedar* (provincial governor) who was directly appointed by the Emperor. The *subedar* was the head of the province and responsible for maintenance of general law and order. He was to encourage agriculture, trade and commerce, and take steps to enhance the revenue of the state. He was also to suppress rebellions and provide army for expeditions.

The head of the revenue department in the suba was the *Diwan*. He was appointed by the Emperor and was an independent officer. He was to supervise the revenue collection in the *suba* and maintain accounts of all expenditures. He was also expected to increase the area under cultivation. In many cases, *taccavi* (advance loans) were given to peasants through his office.

The *Bakshi* in the province performed the same functions as were performed by Mir Bakshi at the centre. He was appointed by the imperial court at the recommendation of the Mir Bakshi. He was responsible for checking and inspecting the horses and soldiers maintained by the *mansabdars* in the *suba*. He issued the pay bills of both the *mansabdars* and the soldiers. Often, his office was combined with *Waqia-navis* as his duty was also to inform the centre about the

happenings in his province.

The representative of the central *Sadar* at the provincial level was called *Sadar*. He was responsible for the welfare of those who were engaged in religious activities and learning. He also looked after the judicial department and in that capacity supervised the works of the *Qazis*.

There were some other officers also who were appointed at the provincial level. *Darogai-i- Dak* was responsible for maintaining the communication channel. He used to pass on letters to the court through the *Merwars* (postal runners).

### **Sarkar**

At the level of *Sarkar*, there were two important functionaries, the *Faujdar* and the *Amalguzar*. It should be noted that the *Faujdari* was an administrative division whereas *Sarkar* was a territorial and revenue division. The primary duty of the *Faujdar* was to maintain law and order and safeguard the life and property of the residents of the areas under his jurisdiction. He also assisted in the timely collection of revenue whenever force was required.

The *Amalguzar* or *Amil* was the revenue collector. His duty was to assess and supervise the revenue collection. He was expected to increase the land under cultivation and induce the peasants to pay revenue willingly. He used to maintain all accounts and send the daily receipt and expenditure report to the provincial *Diwan*.

#### **Pargana**

At the level of *Pargana*, the *Shiqdar* was the executive officer. He assisted the *Amil* in the task of revenue collection. The *Quanungo* kept all the records of land in the *Pargana*. The *Kotwals* were appointed mainly in towns by the imperial government and were in charge of law and order.

### **Village**

The *Muqaddam* was the village headman and the *Patwari* looked after

the village revenue records. The services of the *zamindars* were utilised for the maintenance of law and order in their areas as well as in the collection of revenue.

The forts were placed under an officer called *Qiladar*. He was in charge of the general administration of the fort and the areas assigned in *jagir* to him.

The port administration was independent of the provincial authority. The governor of the port was called *Mutasaddi* who was directly appointed by the Emperor. The *Mutasaddi* collected taxes on merchandise and maintained a customs house. He also supervised the mint house at the port.

### **Land Revenue Administration**

The land revenue system adopted by Akbar was largely based on Sher Shah's system but with slight modifications and was called *Zabti* or *Bandobast* system, which was further improved by Raja Todar Mal. Under this system, Todar Mal introduced a uniform system of land measurement, classification of land, and fixation of rates. The revenue was one third of the average produce and was paid mostly in cash. In c.1580 CE, Akbar introduced the *Dahsala System* under which revenue was fixed on the average yield of land assessed on the basis of past ten years (dah years). Later, a further improvement was made as not only local prices were taken into account, but *parganas* having the same type of productivity were grouped into separate assessment circles. A number of other assessment systems were also followed under Akbar. The most common, and perhaps, the oldest was called *batais or ghallabakhshi* wherein the produce was divided between the peasants and the state in fixed proportion. Another system was *nasaq or kankut* under which a rough appraisement on the basis of the inspection of the crops and past payments made by the village as a whole.

The land was divided into four categories –

- a. *Polaj* (cultivated every year)
- b. *Parati* (fallow, once in two years): *Parati* land paid at the full *polaj* rate when it was cultivated.

- c. *Chachar* (once in three or four years)
- d. *Banjar* (once in five or more years).

Both *chachar* and *banjar* were assessed at concessional rates. Officials called *Karoris* were appointed all over India who were responsible for the collection of a crore of *dams* (Rs 2,50,000) and also audited the facts and figures supplied by the *Qanungos* (local hereditary officials of land record keeping). Akbar was deeply interested in the improvement and extension of cultivation. He asked the *Amil* (revenue officers) to act like a father to the peasants and to advance *taccavi* loans to the peasants for seeds, implements, animals, etc., in times of need and to recover them in easy instalments.

During the 17th century, two new crops, tobacco and maize were added. Potato and red chillies came later in the 18th century. But, no new agricultural technique was introduced during this period. The peasants who owned the land they tilled were called *Khudkasht* who paid land revenue at customary rates.

## **Mansabdari System**

Akbar introduced the *Mansabdari* system in his administration. Under this system, every officer (*Mansabdar*) was assigned a rank (*mansab*). The lowest rank was 10 and the highest was 5,000 for the nobles. Princes of royal blood received even higher ranks. For instance, Raja Man Singh and Mirza Aziz Koka were honoured with the rank of 7,000 each. The *mansab* rank was not hereditary. All appointments and promotions as well as dismissals were directly made by the emperor.

The ranks were further divided into two – *zat* and *sawar*. *Zat* means personal and apart from fixing the personal status of a person in the administration hierarchy, it also decided salary due to him. *Sawar* rank indicated the number of cavalrymen (*sawars*) a person was required to maintain. There were further three categories in every *mansab* (rank):

- a. First category: A person who was required to maintain as many *sawars* as his *zat* rank. For example, in the first category, *zat* and *sawar* ranks were equal (7000/7000)
- b. Second category: If the person maintained half or more *sawars*

as his *zat* rank. For example, in the second category, *sawar* rank was lower than the *zat* but stopped at half, or fifty percent, of the *zat* rank (7000/4000)

c. Third category: If the person maintained less than half as his *zat* rank. For example, in the third category, *sawar* rank was lower than fifty percent of the *zat* rank (7000/3000).

Thus, the *sawar* rank was either equal or less than the *zat*. Even if the *sawar* rank was higher, the *mansabdar*'s position in the official hierarchy would not be affected. It would be decided by the *zat* rank. For example, a *mansabdar* with 4000 *zat* and 2000 *sawar* was higher in rank than a *mansabdar* of 3000 *zat* and 3000 *sawar*. Also, different terminologies were used for persons holding different ranks. For instance, persons holding 500 *zat* were called *mansabdars*, those from 500 to 2500 were called *amirs*, and those holding ranks of 2500 and above were called *amirl-i-umda* or *umda-i-azam*. Interestingly, an *amir* or an *amirl-i-umda* could have another *amir* or *mansabdar* serve under him but not so a *mansabdar*.

The *chehra* (descriptive roll of every soldier) and *dagh* system (branding of horses) was followed. Every noble had to bring his contingent for periodic inspection before persons appointed by the emperor for the purpose. Ideally, 10–20 rule was followed which meant that, for every 10 cavalrymen, the *Mansabdar* had to maintain 20 horses. Interestingly, a *sawar* with only one horse was considered to be only half a *sawar*.

In order to weaken the forces of tribalism and parochialism, adequate care was taken to draw mixed contingents of nobles from all the groups: Mughal, Pathan, Hindustani, and Rajput. Apart from cavalrymen, bowmen, musketeers, sappers, and miners were also recruited in the contingents. Guns and siege guns for breaching forts were also maintained. The salary due to the soldiers was added to the personal salary of the *Mansabdar*, who was paid by assigning to him a *jagir* and sometimes in cash. The *Mansabdar* were paid handsomely. As a matter of fact, the Mughal *Mansabdars* formed the highest paid service in the world. In addition of meeting his personal expenses, the *Mansabdar* had to maintain a stipulated quota of horses, elephants, camels, mules, and

carts. However, later these were maintained centrally, but the *Mansabdar* had to pay for them out of his salary. The only drawback of Mughals was lack of a strong and effective navy.

## **The Jagirdari System**

*Iqta* of the Sultanate period in a modified form became *Jagir* under the Mughals. The *Jagirdari* system, that is to say the system of assignment of revenue of a particular territory to the nobles for their services to the state was an integral part of the *Mansabdari* system. In case the payment was made through the assignment of a *jagir*, the office of the central *Diwan* would identify *parganas* the sum total of whose *Jama* was equal to the salary claim of the *Mansabdars*. *In case, the recorded Jama was in excess of salary claim the assignee was required to deposit the balance with the central treasury*. On the other hand, *if it was less than the salary claim the short fall was paid from the treasury*. There were various types of *jagirs*:

- a. *Tankha Jagirs*: Which were given in lieu of salaries and they were transferable every three to four years.
- b. *Mashrut Jagirs*: Which were given on certain conditions
- c. *Watan Jagirs*: Which were assigned to *zamindar* or *rajas* in their local dominions. *Watan Jagirs* were hereditary and nontransferable. When a *zamindar* was made a *Mansabdar*, he was given *Tankha Jagir* apart from his *Watan Jagir* at another place, if the salary of his rank was more than the income from his *Watan Jagir*.
- d. *Altamgha Jagirs*: Which were given to Muslim nobles in their family towns or place of birth.

Along with *Jagirdars*, there were *zamindars* who were the people who had hereditary rights over the produce of the land and claimed a direct share in the peasants produce which varied from 10% to 25% in different parts of the country. *Zamindars* also assisted the state and the *jagirdar* in the collection of land revenue. They had their own armed forces, and generally lived in forts or *grahis*, which was both a place of refuge and a status symbol. It should be noted that the *zamindar* was *not*

*the* '*owner*' *of all the lands comprising his zamindari*. The peasants who actually cultivated the land could not be dispossessed as long as they paid the land revenue. Thus, the *zamindars* and the peasants had their own hereditary rights in land.

## **Religious Policy**

Akbar rose to fame in the pages of history due to his religious policy. Various factors were responsible for his religious ideas. The most important among them were his early contacts with the Sufi saints, the teachings of his tutor Abdul Latif, his marriage with Rajput women, his association with intellectual giants like Shaikh Mubarak and his two illustrious sons – Abul Faizi and Abul Fazl – and his ambition to establish an empire in Hindustan.

In the beginning of his life, Akbar was a pious Muslim. He regularly visited the shrine of Sheikh Muinuddin Chisti at Ajmer. Later, he became a sceptical Muslim. Soon after marrying Jodha Bai of Amber, he abolished the pilgrim tax and in c.1562 CE, he abolished *jiziya*. He allowed his Hindu wives to worship their own gods. In c.1575 CE, he constructed the *Ibadat Khana* (Hall of prayers) at his new capital Fatehpur Sikri wherein Akbar invited learned scholars from all religions like Hinduism, Jainism, Christianity, and Zoroastrianism and used to conduct religious discussions with them. Some of the scholars were:

- Pursottam Das – Hindu
- Dastur Maharji Rana – Parsi (of Navsari)
- Hira Vijaya Suri – Jain saint of Kathiawar
- Aquaviva and Monserrate – Christian (sent by the Portuguese on Akbar's request)

He disliked the interference of the Muslim *ulemas* in political matters. In c.1579 CE, he issued the "Infallibility Decree" by which he asserted his religious powers.

In c.1582 CE, he promulgated a new religion called *Din-i-Ilahi*/*Tauhindi-Ilahi* (Divine Monotheism), which believes in one God and in *Sul-i-Kul*/peace to all. It contained the good points of all religions and the basics were rational. However, his new faith proved to be a failure. It fizzled out after his death. Even during his lifetime, it had only followers including Birbal, Abul Fazl, and Abul Faizi.

## **Akbar's Navratnas**

Akbar, despite his illiteracy, was a great lover of the artists and intellectuals. His passion for knowledge and interest in learning from great minds attracted him to men of genius to his court. Nine of these courtiers were known as Akbar's *Navratnas* (or *nine jewels*):

## **Mughal Dynasty after akbar**

Jahangir/ Salim (c.1605–1627 CE)

- Jodha Bai and Akbar's eldest son, was named Salim after blessings of Sheikh Salim Chisti.
- Revolted against Akbar in c.1599 CE. After Akbar's death, he was crowned at Agra in c.1605 CE, and assumed the title of Nur-ud-din Muhammad Jahangir (Conqueror of the World).
- In c.1611 CE, he married Mehrunnisa (widow of Sher Afghani). He gave her title of Nur Jahan (Light of the World) and her father Gyas Beg was given title of *Itmaduddaulah*.
- Nur Jahan had great influence on Jahangir's life and dominated the royal household and set new fashions based on Persian traditions. She encouraged Persian art and culture in the court. She was given the status of *Padshah Begum* and was the only woman in Mughal Darbar. The

coins were struck in her name and all royal *farmans* also had her name. She was a constant companion of Jahangir and even joined him in his hunting.

- A lot of members of her family benefited from this alliance. She got high positions for her father (chief *diwan*) and brother Asaf Khan (was appointed as *Khan-i-Saman*). In c.1612 CE, Asaf Khan's daughter, Arjumand Banu Begum (later known as Mumtaz), married Jahangir's third son, prince Khurram (later Shah Jahan).
- Rebellions: Jahangir's rule witnessed a spate of rebellions. His eldest son Khusrau (son of Jahangir and Man Bai, daughter of Bhagwan Das) revolted but was defeated and imprisoned. The fifth Sikh *guru*, Arjun Dev, was beheaded for supporting the rebel prince Khusrau.
  - For the first 10 years, after Khurram's marriage to Mumtaz Mahal, there was practically a rule of alliance of Noor Jahan, her father, her brother Asaf Khan, and Khurram. But problems arose when Noor Jahan married her daughter Ladli Begum (by Sher Afghani) to Jahangir's youngest son Shahryar, and now she supported him as the heir apparent. So this drove Khurram (Shah Jahan) into rebellion against his father in c.1622 CE, since he felt that Jahangir was completely under Nur Jahan's influence. However, some historians believe that Shah Jahan revolted against his father due to his personal ambitions. Jahangir had ordered Shah Jahan to go to Qandahar, which was besieged by the Persians but Shah Jahan was afraid that the campaign would be a long and difficult one and intrigues would be hatched against him during his absence from the court. Hence, he put forward a number of unreasonable demands such as full command of the army, which included the veterans of the Deccan, complete sway over the Punjab, and a number of other forts, etc. He was defeated by the forces led by Mahabat Khan.

However, this rebellion kept the empire distracted for four years, i.e., till c.1626 CE and resulted in the loss of Qandahar, and emboldened the Deccanis to recover all the territories surrendered to the Mughals.

- Mughal expansion under Jahangir: In c.1615 CE, Amar Singh of Mewar (son of Maharana Pratap) submitted before him. Rana's son Karan Singh was made *Mansabdar* in the Mughal court.
  - In c.1616 CE, with the help of Maratha *sardars* , Khan-i-Khanan inflicted a crushing defeat on the combined forces of Ahmadnagar, Bijapur, and Golconda.
  - In c.1620 CE, Jahangir annexed Kangra.He was the first muslim ruler to do so.
  - In c.1622 CE, Qandahara was occupied by Shah Abbas of Persia.
  - Conquest of Deccan: Jahangir decided to follow Akbar's expansionist policy in the Deccan. But Jahangir could achieve little success in it due to certain problems:
    - He could not devote much attention in the crucial phase due to Khurram's revolt.
    - The Mughal nobles were also involved in a number of intrigues and conflicts in Deccan.
    - Due to the rise of Malik Ambar in Deccan: Malik Ambar, with the help of Marathas and the ruler of Bijapur Ibrahim Adil Shah, made it difficult for the Mughals to consolidate their position in Berar, Ahmadnagar, and Balaghat.
- After Jahangir's death in c.1627 CE, Shah Jahan reached Agra and with the support of the nobles, chief *diwan* Asaf Khan and the army, Shah Jahan ascended the throne. Nur Jahan was given a pension and she lived a retired life till her death 18 years later.
- The British visited Machlipatnam during Jahangir's reign. Captain Hawkins (c.1608–11 CE) and Thomas Roe (c.1615–

19 CE) visited his court. Thomas Roe got the *farman* for setting up an English factory at Surat.

- Jahangir had a chain of justice hung outside his palace.
- Jahangir mostly lived in Lahore and he forbade the killings of animals for food on Tuesday and Friday.
- Wrote the *Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri* (autobiography) in Persian, in which he described his drinking habit. He also patronised valuable dictionary *Farhang-i-Jahangiri*. During his reign, Abdul Hamid Lahori wrote *Padshah Namah* and Khafi Khan wrote *Muntakhab-i-Lubab*. He also patronised many scholars like Ghiyas Beg, Naqib Khan, and Niamatullah.
- Art and Architecture during Jahangir's reign: The practice of putting up buildings in marble and decorating the walls with floral designs made of semi-precious stones (known as Pietra Durra) started during his reign.

**Itmad-ud-dulah Tomb Agra**

- Noor Jahan built the tomb of her father Itmad-ud-dulah at Agra.
- Jahangir built Moti Masjid at Lahore and his own mausoleum at Lahore. He laid a number of gardens such as the Shalimar and Nishant gardens in Kashmir.
- Mughal painting reached its zenith under Jahangir. He employed a number of painters like Abul Hasan, Bishan Das (regarded as master of portraits), Madhu, Anant, Manohar, Govardhan and Ustad Mansur (specialist in animal painting). The use of 'Halo' or 'Divine lights' behind king's head started under him. Apart from painting the scenes of hunting, battles and royal courts, progress was made in portrait painting and paintings of animals.

Shah Jahan (c.1628–58 CE)

– Also known as Khurram, whose mother was the Hindu Jagat Gosain, and was married to Arjumand Banu Begum (Mumtaz Mahal).

- He was crowned in Agra in c.1628 CE; had to face instant revolt by Bundelas under Jujhar Singh and Khan Jahan Lodhi, the Mughal governor of the Deccan. Khan Jahan Lodhi, with the intention of securing help in times of necessity, gave away Balaghat to the Nizam Shah, to which Shah Jahan objected and ordered Khan Jahan Lodi to recover it. As the latter failed, Shah Jahan recalled him to court. Khan Jahan, however, turned hostile and took shelter with Nizam Shah. This infuriated Shah Jahan and he decided to follow an aggressive policy to recover the lost territories of the Deccan.
- Shah Jahan's Deccan policy was more successful. Ascertaining the fact that there could be no peace for the Mughals in the Deccan as long as Ahmadnagar continued as an independent state, he successfully isolated Ahmadnagar by winning over Bijapur and the Marathas. Fath Khan, son of Malik Ambar, also made peace with the Mughals, and Mahabat Khan was appointed governor of Deccan. But the conflict with Deccan states continued. Finally in c.1636 CE, *ahdnama* (treaties) were signed with Bijapur and Golconda. The main points of agreement with Bijapur were:
  - i. Adil Shah accepted the Mughal suzerainty
  - ii. He was to pay 20 lakh rupees as indemnity
  - iii. He was not to interfere in the affairs of Golconda
  - iv. Mughal emperor was to arbitrate in case of any future dispute between Bijapur and Golconda
  - v. Adil Shah was to help Mughals in conflict against Shahji Bhonsle (father of Shivaji)

In return for these, territory worth about 20 lakh *huns* annually belonging to Ahmadnagar was ceded to Bijapur. Shah Jahan completed the settlement of the Deccan by entering into a treaty with Golconda as well. According to this treaty:

> i. Golconda took oath of loyalty towards Mughal emperor.

He agreed to include the name of the Mughal emperor in the *Khutba* and exclude the name of the Shah of Iran.

ii. Golconda agreed to pay two lakh *huns* per year to the Mughals.

These treaties ended the conflicts in the Deccan. The Mughals could have large parts of Southern India under their domination, and peace with the Mughals enabled the Deccani states to expand their territories towards the south. However, rapid expansion weakened the internal cohesion of the Deccan states and ambitious nobles like Shahji and his son Shivaji in Bijapur, Mir Jumla in Golconda, started carving out spheres of influence for themselves and this again created a conflicting atmosphere in Deccan. In c.1656 CE, following the death of Muhammad Adil Shah, a distinct change came in Mughal policy and the treaties were ignored. The justification provided by Mughals was that both these states had made extensive conquests in Karnataka and that "compensation" was due to the Mughals on the ground that the two states were Mughal vassals, and their conquests had been made possible due to the benevolent neutrality on the part of the Mughals. Now, Shah Jahan asked his son Aurangzeb to conquer and annex the territories of Deccan kingdoms. However, this change did not benefit the Mughal empire in any substantial way, in fact it created more problems for future.

- In c.1632 CE, Shah Jahan defeated the Portuguese near Hughli due to the regular abuse of trading privilege by them.
- In c.1639 CE, Shah Jahan secured Qandahara and immediately fortified it, but Persia wrested Qandahara from Mughals. In c.1649 CE. Shah Jahan launched a prolonged campaign in the North-West Frontier to recover Qandahara and other ancestral lands, but all the campaigns failed. Gradually Shah Jahan realised the futility of his ambition and stopped fighting. Thus, there was the permanent loss of Qandahara.
- Shah Jahan's reign is considered the 'The Golden age' of the Mughal Empire. He built:

• Taj Mahal: Counted among seven wonders of the world and considered a jewel of the builder's art. The construction was commissioned in c.1631 CE and was constructed in 22 years. The architectural design was prepared by Ustad Isa and Isa Muhammad Effendi, while the main dome was designed by Ismail Khan.

**Taj Mahal, Agra**

- Mosque-building reached its peak during Shah Jahan's reign. He built the Moti Masjid at Agra (built entirely in white marble), the Sheesh Mahal and Mussaman Burj at Agra (where he spent his last years in captivity), while the Jama Masjid at Delhi was built in red stone.
- The climax of fort-building reached during the reign of Shah Jahan. The famous Red Fort at Delhi with its

Rang Mahal, Diwan-i-Am, and Diwan-i-Khas was his creation. He also built the Jama Masjid in Delhi, Shalimar Bagh in Lahore, and the city of Shahjahanabad. He also got Bebadal Khan to build the Peacock Throne, on which is inscribed the Amir Khusrao couplet: *"If there is a paradise on earth*, *it is here"*.

#### **Red Fort**

- Shah Jahan also patronised many writers and historians like Inayat Khan, who wrote *Shah Jahan Nama*. His son Dara Shikoh translated the Bhagavat Gita and Upanishads into the Persian language.
- His reign is described by:
  - French travellers – Bernier and Tavernier
  - Italian traveller – Manucci
  - Peter Mundy described famine during Shah Jahan's time.
- Shah Jahan's sudden illness in c.1657 CE plunged the empire into a civil war (c.1657–59 CE) among his four sons, who were located in the following places:
  - Dara Shikoh (eldest and crown prince), based in Delhi,

supported by Jahanara, the daughter of Jahangir.

- Shuja, the governor of Bengal.
- Aurangzeb, the governor of Deccan, supported by Roshanara.
- Murad Baksh, the governor of Malwa and Gujarat
- At first, Shuja declared himself the emperor, but he was defeated by Sulaiman Sheikh, son of Dara Shikoh with the aid of Mirza Raja Jai Singh. Aurangzeb and Murad agreed to partition the empire and both defeated Raja Jaswant Singh (ruler of Jodhpur) and Qasim Khan at the Battle of Dharmat (in c.1658 CE).
- Later, just after a month, the Battle of Samugarh (c.1658 CE) was fought between Aurangzeb and Dara in which, due to divided counsel and underestimation of Aurangzeb by Dara, Dara Shikoh lost the battle. This practically decided the issue of succession. Aurangzeb also treacherously imprisoned Murad and sent him to Gwalior jail, where he was killed two years later. Aurangzeb soon crowned himself with the title of '*Alamgir'*(conqueror of the world), but the civil war continued for more than two years.
- In c.1658 CE the Battle of Khajwah (near Allahabad) was fought between Aurangzeb and Shuja in which again Aurangzeb emerged victorious.
- The Battle of Deorai (c.1659 CE) was the last major battle Dara fought against Aurangzeb, in which he was again defeated and he had to flee to Afghanistan. On his way in the Bolan Pass, a treacherous chief imprisoned him and handed him over to Aurangzeb who had him executed, and later, his son Sulaiman Sheikh too. Interestingly, after the Battle of Deorai, the second coronation of Aurangzeb happened.
- Aurangzeb made Shah Jahan prisoner in Agra Fort, where he was looked after by his daughter Jahanara till his death in c.1666 CE.
- Aurangazeb emerged victorious in this struggle. He entered

the Agra Fort after defeating Dara and forced Shah Jahan to surrender. Shah Jahan was confined to the Agra fort and put under vigil. But, he was not ill-treated. Shah Jahan lived for eight long years lovingly nursed by his daughter Jahanara. He died in c.1666 CE and was buried beside his wife's grave in the Taj Mahal.

– The *financial bickering between father and son* form a large part of Aurangzeb's correspondence, known as *Adabi-Alamgiri*.

Aurangzeb (c.1658–1707 CE)

- Was one of the ablest of the Mughal emperors under whom the Mughal empire reached its greatest territorial limits and emerged as the largest single state ever known in India from the dawn of history to the rise of British power.
- Reign:
  - First 25 years in north India, when Maratha power under Shivaji emerged.
  - Last 25 years in Deccan.
- Northern Conquest: Aurangzeb could expand Mughal power in Assam in the north-east region. In c.1662 CE, Mir Jumla, Aurangzeb's ablest general and the governor of Bengal, led the expedition against the Ahoms. Despite concluding a favourable treaty, Mughals suffered heavy losses and Jumla died in c.1663 on his way back to Dacca. Another notable achievement in north-east was capture of island of Sondip and Chittagong in c.1664 CE under Shaista Khan, the new governor of Bengal, who also chastised the Arakanese pirates. However, the Ahom kingdom could not be controlled for long and the Mughal *faujdars* had to face resistance and regular conflicts. Thus, by c.1680 CE, the Ahoms succeeded in capturing Kamrupa and Mughal control over the territory ended.
- Conquest of Deccan: Prof. Satish Chandra identifies four distinct phases in Aurangzeb's policy towards the Deccan states:

### A.Phase I (c.1658–68 CE)

- The main attempt was to recover from Bijapur the territories belonging to the Ahmadnagar state, surrendered to it by the treaty of c.1636 CE.
- Led by Jai Singh, the governor of Deccan. The focus was to get hold of the territories of Kalyani, Bidar, and Parenda from Bijapur.
- The Mughals failed to lay siege on Bijapur in c.1665 CE and Jai Singh died in c.1667 CE.
- However, Sholapur was secured by bribery in c. 1668 CE.

### B.Phase II (c.1668–84 CE)

- The Marathas were considered as the major danger in the Deccan and efforts were made to pressurise Bijapur and Golconda into joining hands with the Mughals against Shivaji and then against his son Sambhaji. Thus, during this phase, attempts were made to secure the help of the Deccan states against Marathas.
- This shift in Mughal policy was due to the death of Adil Shah of Bijapur, the growing power of Shivaji, and the increasing influence of the brothers Akhanna and Madanna in Golconda administration, but Aurangzeb's efforts to contain the Marathas were not very successful as the tripartite alliance between Golcanda, Shivaji, and Bijapur did not allow Aurangzeb to have his way.
- In c. 1679–80 CE, desperate effort by Mughal viceroy Diler Khan to capture Bijapur failed due to this tripartite alliance.

### C.Phase III (c.1686–87 CE)

• Aurangzeb followed the policy of outright annexation of the Deccan states. He personally supervised the siege of Bijapur (c.1686 CE) and Golconda (c.1687 CE), along with the territory of Karnataka. Aurangzeb made Khirki, founded by Malik Ambar, the capital of Mughal

Deccan and named it Aurangabad.

#### D.Phase IV (c.1687–1707 CE)

- Aurangzeb spent most of his time in Deccan and despite of the conflict with Marathas, he managed to keep the region under Mughal control. It was during this period that Sambhaji (Shivaji's son) was captured and executed at Sangameshwar. But after his death in c.1707 CE (at Aurangabad in Deccan), the Marathas reasserted their independence and succeeded within a short span of time.
- In fact, the destruction of the Deccan kingdoms was a political blunder on the part of Aurangzeb as with the fall of the Deccan Sultanate, the barrier between the Mughals and the Marathas was removed and there ensued a direct confrontation between them. Also, his Deccan campaigns exhausted the Mughal treasury. According to J.N. Sarkar, *the Deccan ulcer ruined Aurangzeb*.
- Religious Policy and rebelions: Various rebellions took place during his reign due to his harsh religious policy. This included the rebellions of the Jat peasantry at Mathura (under their leader Gokla in c.1669 CE, under Rajaram in c.1685 CE, and under Churaman in c.1691 CE), the Satnami peasantry in Punjab, and the Bundelas in Bundelkhand (under king Chatrasaal) in c.1672 CE.
  - Aurangzeb was a staunch and orthodox Muslim in his personal life and his ideal was to transform India into an Islamic state. Initially, Aurangzeb banned the construction of new Hindu temples and the repair of old temples, but later he gradually started destroying Hindu temples. The celebrated temples of Keshava Rai at Mathura (built by Bir Singh Deo Bundela in the reign of Jahangir) and the Vishwanath temple at Banaras were reduced to ruins and mosques erected in their place. In c.1679 CE, he reimposed *jiziya* and pilgrim tax.

- He was also not tolerant of other Muslim sects. The celebration of Muharram was stopped. In fact, his invasions against the Deccan sultanates were partly due to his hatred of the Shia faith. In c. 1675 CE, he executed the ninth Sikh Guru, Tegh Bahadur, which resulted in the rebellion of the Sikh community against him.
- He gave excessive powers to the office of *Muhtasib*, the officer entrusted to enforce moral codes and *shara*. Throughout his kingdom, drinking was prohibited and cultivation and the use of *bhang* and other drugs were banned. He also forbade music in the Mughal court and discontinued the practice of *Jharokha darshan* (as he considered it a superstitious practice and against Islam) and the system of weighing the emperor in gold, the celebration of *Dasarah*, forbade astrologers from preparing *almanacs*, forbade the use of Kalma inscribed on his coins, abolished Nauroz (as it was a Zoroastrian practice favoured by the Safavid rulers of Iran), and also forbade Sati.
- However, it is also believed that he also issued secular decrees, called *zawabit* which sometimes along with supplementing the *shara*, often modified it in view of the conditions prevalent in India. Another interesting and notable point is that the largest number of Persian works on classical Indian music were written in Aurangzeb's reign and that Aurangzeb himself was proficient in playing the *veena*.
- Aurangzeb's Rajput policy also alienated the Rajputs and they gradually lost their position in the administrative set up. Aurangzeb's policy towards Marwar and Mewar was clumsy and blundering and brought no advantage of any kind to the Mughals. He wanted to divide the Marwar state between the two principal claimants, and in the process alienated both, as also the ruler of Mewar who considered

Mughal interference in such matters to be a dangerous precedent. The breach with Mewar and the long drawn-out war which followed damaged the moral standing of the Mughal state.

- On the death of Raja Jaswant Singh of Marwar in c.1678 CE, Aurangzeb gave the *tika* of Jodhpur to his nephew, Inder Singh, instead of his son Ajit Singh. The dispute escalated when Ajit Singh's younger brother died. Aurangzeb sent a force to capture the two queens and Ajit from the Rathor mansion in Shahjahanabad, but his attempt was rebuffed by Durgadas Rathor, a senior officer of the former ruler who initially used gunfire in retaliation and eventually escaped from the city to Jodhpur along with Ajit and the two queens, who were disguised as men. A loyal nanny of Ajit Singh left behind her own son at the mansion as Ajit Singh.
- Rana Raj Singh of Mewar sided with Rani Hadi and the young prince Ajit Singh. In c.1679 CE, Aurangzeb attacked Mewar and the Rajputs had to retire to the hills, from where they engaged in sporadic guerrilla warfare. Finally, in c.1698 CE, Ajit Singh was recognised as the ruler of Marwar.
- Personality and Character of Aurangzeb: In his private life, Aurangzeb was industrious, disciplined, was very simple in food, dressing, and did not at all consume wine.
  - He was learned and proficient in Arabic and Persian languages and was a great lover of books. He patronised the greatest digest of Muslim law in India, *Fatwa-i-Alamgiri*.
  - He was highly devoted to his religion and conducted prayers five times a day, strictly observing the Ramzan fasting. In fact, he earned money for his personal expenses by copying the *Quran* and selling those copies. Due to all these qualities, he was called *Darvesh*/ *Zindapir* (a living saint).

## **Art and Architecture during his reign:**

- Constructed the Moti Masjid at Delhi and the Badshahi Mosque at Lahore.
- Aurangzeb adopted an effective revenue system at Bengal and appointed Murshid Quli Khan as Diwan of Bengal.
- Dara
  - Was a great scholar, wrote *Majma-ul-Bahrain*
  - Translated the Upanishads and Bhagvat Gita
  - Also wrote *Safinat-ul-auliya*, *Sainat-ul-Auliya*, *Hasanat-ul-Arifin*.
- Mirza Mohd. Qasim: wrote *Alamgirnama*
- Ishwar Das Nagar: wrote *Fatuhat-i-alamgiri*
- Nimat Khan Ali: wrote *Wakai-i-Hyderabad*, the conquest of Golconda by Aurangzeb.

## ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LIFE UNDER THE MUHALS

The Mughal period saw important social and economic developments. During this period, many European travellers and traders came to India and their accounts contain a lot of information about the socioeconomic conditions of India. In general, they described the wealth and prosperity of India and also the luxurious life of the aristocratic classes. On the other side, they also mentioned the poverty and sufferings of the ordinary people such as peasants and artisans. Nikitin observed *that the people of Deccan were bare-footed and it might be due to high cost of leather*.

## **Growth of Trade**

The Indian trading classes were large in numbers, well-spread throughout the country and were well organised and highly

professional. *Seth*, *bohra* traders specialised in long distance trade while local traders were called *banik*. Another class of traders known as *banjaras*, were specialised in carrying bulk goods and used to move to long distances with their goods on the back of oxen. Interestingly, the trading community did not belong to one caste or religion. For instance, the Gujarati merchants included Hindus, Jains, and Muslims, in Rajasthan Oswals, Maheshwaris, and Agarwals came to be called the Marwaris, while in south India, the Chettis on the Coramandal coast and the Muslim merchants of Malabar formed important trading communities.

Just like communities, different regions emerged as prominent trading stations. For instance:

- Bengal exported sugar, rice, as well as delicate muslin and silk.
- The Coromandal coast became a centre of textile production.
- Gujarat was an entry point of foreign goods. From there, fine textiles and silk were taken to north India. Indigo and food grains were exported from north India through Gujarat. It was also the distribution centre for the luxury products of Kashmir such as shawls and carpets.

India, during the Mughal period, witnessed further intensification of her foreign trade owing to the advent of the European trading companies and their direct participation in the Euro- Asian and Intra-Asian trade. India had trade relations with central Asia, Persia, and Europe. Her major export included textiles, saltpetre, sugar, opium and spices. In comparison to her export, her imports were limited to select commodities like war horses, luxury items such as ivory, silver, silk, porcelain, good quality wine, carpets, perfume, glass, watches, silver utensils, tin and copper, etc. The movement of goods occurred through a complex network, linking wholesalers with merchants down to the regional and local levels through agents (*gumashtas*) and commission agents (*dalals*). The movement of goods was also facilitated by the growth of a financial system which permitted easy transmission of money from one part of the country to another. This was done through the use of *hundis*, a paper document promising payment of money after a fixed period of time at a discount and certain place. The *hundis* often

included insurance which was charged at different rates on the basis of value of the goods, destination, means of transport (land, river, or sea), etc. The *sarrafs* (*shroffs*) who specialised in changing money, also specialised in dealing with *hundis*. In the process, they also acted as private banks as they lent money to nobles and kept their money too. By means of *hundis*, they created credit which supplemented the money in circulation.

The trading community in India, especially in the port towns, included some of the richest merchants who were comparable to merchant princes of Europe such as Virji Vohra, Abdul Ghafur Bohra, Malay Chetti of the Coromandel coast, Kashi Viranna and Sunca Rama Chetti. Each community of merchants had its leader known as *nagarseth*, who could intercede with the local officials on their behalf. In fact there were instances of strikes by merchants in Ahmedabad to stress their points of view.

## **Growth of Administration:** *Mansabdari* **System and the Mughal army.**

The *mansab* and *jagir* systems under the Mughals evolved through the time. As we have discussed earlier, the mansabdari system, evolved by Akbar, was the basis of civil and military administrations under the Mughals. Jahangir introduced a new provision in the *sawar* rank. According to it, a part of *sawar* rank was termed *du-aspa sih-aspa* in case of select *mansabdars*. He probably introduced this provision to promote nobles of his confidence and strengthen them militarily. By this provision, he could increase the military strength of his nobles without effecting any change in their *zat* rank and for this part, additional payment at the same rate of 8,000 *dams* per *sawar* was sanctioned. Thus, if the *sawar* rank was 4000 out of which 1000 was *du-aspa sihaspa*, the salary for this *sawar* was calculated as 3,000 × 8,000 + (1,000 × 8,000 × 2) = 40,000,000 *dams*. Without *du-aspa sih-aspa*, salary for the 4,000 *sawar* would have stood at (4,000 × 8,000) = 32,000,000 *dams*. Thus, the *mansabdar* was to maintain double the number of *sawars* for the *du-aspa sih-aspa* category and was paid for it.

Shah Jahan introduced the month-scale in the *mansabdari* system to compensate the gap between *Jama* (estimated income) and *hasil* (actual realisation). As we know, the *mansabaars* were generally paid through revenue assignments, i.e., *jagirs*. The biggest problem was that calculation was made on the basis of the expected income (*Jama*) from the *jagir* during one year. It was noticed that the actual revenue collection (*hasil*) always fell short of the estimated income. In such a situation, the *mansabdar*'s salary were fixed by a method called monthscale. Thus, if a *jagir* yielded only half of the *Jama*, it was called *Shashmaha* (six monthly), and if it yielded only one fourth, it was called *Sihmaha* (three monthly). The month scale was applied to cash salaries also. There were deductions from the sanctioned pay also. During the reign of Shah Jahan, the *mansabdars* were allowed to maintain 1/5 to 1/3 of the sanctioned strength of the *sawar* rank without any accompanying reduction in their claim on the maintenance amount for the *sawar* rank.

Later, Aurangzeb continued with all these changes and created an additional rank called *Mashrut* (conditional). This was an attempt to increase the *sawar* rank of the *mansabdar* temporarily. Aurangzeb added one another deduction called *Khurak-i- dawwab*, towards meeting the cost for feed of animals in the imperial stables.
