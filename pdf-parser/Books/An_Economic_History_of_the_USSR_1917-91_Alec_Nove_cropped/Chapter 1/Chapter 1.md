# Industrial Growth

In the last years before it was engulfed by war and revolution, the Russian Empire had reached a level of development which, though leaving it well behind the major industrialized Western powers, was none the less appreciable. It would be quite misleading to assume that the communists took over a wholly undeveloped and illiterate country with a stagnant economy. So our first task must be to take a brief look at the progress of the empire, and at least by implication to consider whether she was well on the road to a modern economy when the process was interrupted **in 1914.** 

Russia in 1854 faced the Western powers with an obsolete social organization and obsolete weapons. Society was still dominated by an inflexible caste system, and most of the peasants were serfs owned by the landed proprietors, the State or the Crown. Industry had languished since 1800. At this date Russian output of metal had been equal to Britain's; by 1854 she had fallen very far behind. The only railway of importance that had been completed ran from St Petersburg to Moscow, with a line to Warsaw under construction. The Russian army in the Crimea had to be supplied by horse and cart on dirt tracks; this army consisted of serfs serving virtually for life, and was poorly armed and equipped. The fleet had no steamboats and could only be sunk to block the entrance to Sevastopol. The military failure in the Crimea was a great shock to Tsar and society alike. The empire as a military power had failed to keep pace with the changing world; it had to be modernized. No doubt all this helped to precipitate the abolition of serfdom. At first the government remained strongly influenced by conservative and traditional views, as may be seen from the limitations on the mobility and enterprise of peasants which formed part of the emancipation provisions of 1861. It was only gradually that the conscious pursuit of industrialization became a major motivation of policy. However, the need for railway building was clearly understood after the terrible lessons of the Crimea, and the building of them vitally influenced the development of the Russian economy in the second half of the nineteenth century. No one doubts that in the fifty-three years which separated the abolition of serfdom from the outbreak of the First World War there had been rapid economic growth and major social change, and it is certainly of interest to compare Russia's growth at this period with that of other countries and with the subsequent achievements of the communists. This is an extremely difficult task, especially as the statistics are often confusing and defective. In pre-revolutionary times systematic figures tend to be available only for large- and medium-scale industry, whereas handicrafts and small workshops were still extremely important. It is a task beyond the scope of the present study to attempt any recalculation of statistics and growth rates under the empire. So far as industry is concerned, Goldsmith's admirably thorough reconstructions (which also cite and develop indices calculated by the eminent Russian economist Kondratiev) give a number of different index series, depending on the weights used. For simplicity I will cite here his value-added 'imputed' weights with 1900 prices.<sup>1</sup>

For the period 1888-1913 this index gives one a growth rate of

just about s per cent per annum. This was fairly high - higher on a *per capita* basis than in either the United States or Germany. However, the much slower rate of increase in agriculture, and the high share of agriculture in Russia's employment and national income, made the overall performance appear much more modest. Rough national income estimates, made by Goldsmith, show Russian growth rates well below those of the United States and Japan, a little below that of Germany, though above Britain and France. With Russia's very rapid increase in population, the *per capita* figures were less favourable still. Goldsmith considers that Russia's real income per head was *relatively* higher in i860, in comparison with the United States and Japan, than in 1913; in other words their growth was more rapid than Russia's. Growth, though very rapid in certain years, was exceedingly uneven. For example, in the decade 1891-1900 industrial production more than doubled, and, in particular, there was a very marked advance in heavy industry. This was the consequence of the protective tariffs introduced in 1891, and of the deliberate policy followed in subsequent years by Count Witte, who became Minister of Finance. The output of pig iron in Russia trebled during the decade, while production in Germany increased in these same years by only 1.6. Output of oil during this decade kept pace with that of the United States, and in fact in 1900 Russia's oil production was the highest in the world, being slightly ahead of America's. The same decade saw a great railway boom, with the total track mileage increasing by 73.5 per cent. However, an economic crisis led to a slowdown of growth in the years 1900- 1905 and again in the period 1907-9. This particularly affected manufacture of iron and steel, and it was not until 1910 that the output of pig iron surpassed the 1900 level. From then until the outbreak of war there was another sharp upswing in industrial production. A Soviet textbook, which is not likely to overstate the achievements of Tsarism, has put forward the following estimates: during the period 1860-1910 the world's industrial production increased by six, Great Britain's by 2.5, Germany's by six and Russia's by 10.5.<sup>2</sup>

The argument was advanced by Soviet historians that the economic growth of the empire was none the less much too slow

#### **Russian Empire in 1913**

**and that** Russia remained very far behind the more advanced countries. In percentage terms Russia's growth compared favourably with her rivals, but it was still inadequate in relation to her rich natural resources and to the great gap which separated her from Western Europe and the United States. The following figures given by a present-day Soviet source, and relating to the post-war boundaries of the USSR, compare Russia's production figures with those of the USA and the United Kingdom:

It is interesting to note that the oil industry failed to maintain its rate of progress and in fact fell back in the first decade of the century.

An original and skilful attempt to measure the relative progress of the powers was made by P. Bairoch.<sup>3</sup> The result strongly supports the view that Russia, despite her very considerable growth, was not making much headway in catching up with the more advanced countries. Bairoch's calculations are based on a combination of the following: consumption of raw cotton and coal, production of pig iron, the railway network, and power generation. For Russia he uses mainly data taken from Goldsmith's study. All figures are expressed *per capita.* Given the statistical inadequacies of the nineteenth century, this method has much to commend it, though the author would be the last to claim its accuracy. Russia's industrial performance is shown in the table on page 7. This table shows that, far from overtaking even Spain, Russia in these fifty years fell behind Italy. The author comments: *'Des la fin du XIX""" siecle, c'est la Russie qui se place au dernier rang des pays europeens etudies ici'* 

Similar conclusions follow for the calculations of S. N. Prokopovich:<sup>4</sup>

#### National income

The Russian engineer-economist, Professor Grinevetsky, came to the same conclusion. Quoting Russia's backwardness in metalgoods industries, he wrote:

These comparisons eloquently speak of the fact that Russia in her prewar economic growth was not merely not catching up the younger countries with powerful capitalist development, but was in fact falling behind. This conclusion would be very sad for our social-political vanity, but it must be considered as an indubitable fact.<sup>5</sup>

As might be expected, given the many statistical gaps, there exist some alternative estimates which show a somewhat better performance for the Tsarist economy in the period up to 1913. Those interested may be referred to the works of Paul R. Gregory and M. E. Falkus.<sup>6</sup> Even these higher estimates do not show the Russian Empire catching up such countries as Germany, at least not on a *per capita* basis. None the less, one must note that they do modify the gloomy picture presented by Prokopovich and Goldsmith.

Russia was thus the least developed European power, but a European power none the less. She was capable of overwhelming militarily and competing economically with a partly developed European state such as Austria-Hungary. But her development was exceedingly uneven both industrially and geographically. Her modern industry was very modern indeed, with a marked tendency to large and well-equipped factories using the most up-todate Western models. These were principally in the areas of St Petersburg and Moscow, in Russian Poland and in the Ukraine. The main metallurgical centre was now in the south, using

Donets Basin coal. The older Urals metallurgical centre was declining. Most of the rest of the country had very little industry other than handicrafts. Apart from the oil of Baku, the southern and eastern territories were particularly primitive.

A disproportionate share of some industries was concentrated in areas lost to Russia after the First World War and the civil war (the Baltic states, and territories which became part of Poland and Romania). The following table illustrates this:

The relative importance of small-scale (workshop and artisan) industry at this period may be illustrated by the following figures: in 1915 it employed about 67 per cent of those engaged in industry of 5.2 million persons. It produced 33 per cent of industrial output, $^{7}$  i.e. the output per head was only a quarter of that of workers engaged in large-scale industry. This shows the contrast between the modern and the old, between great industrial plant and tiny cottage-industry or workshop, which, of course, was and is to be found in other developing countries.

A similar unevenness characterized the growth of different sections of industry. Thus while there was impressive growth in the metallurgical, textile, fuel and food-processing industries, engineering lagged far behind. Most industrial equipment continued to come from abroad. This weakness was to be a principal

## Capital, Domestic and Foreign

**The progress of Russian industrialization suffered from relative shortage of capital, as well as from a poorly developed banking system and a generally low standard of commercial morality. The traditional Muscovite merchants, rich and uneducated, were far from being the prototypes of a modern commercial capitalism. The situation changed towards the end of the nineteenth century, and particularly during the rapid industrialization which characterized the nineties. There was a marked growth of both Russian and foreign capital, and an equal improvement in the banking system. Russian entrepreneurs of a modern type began more and more to emerge. Under cover of the protective tariff of 1891, and with the establishment of a stabilized rouble based on the gold standard, foreign capital received every encouragement. This was particularly the work of Count Witte, who exercised a dominant influence over Russian financial and commercial policy at this time. His public statements and papers make it abundantly clear that he was pursuing deliberately a policy of industrialization, and that the dominant motive was the traditional one that a relatively backward Russia must catch up with the more developed powers, particularly in her potential to produce the means of national power, above all armaments. While anxious to obtain foreign financial help in the form of loans and investments, Witte was frankly surprised that such help should be forthcoming. When an economic conflict broke out with Germany, and Bismarck placed a ban on German credits to the Russian Empire, Witte sent the following memorandum to the Tsar:** 

**True enough, what sense is there for foreign states to give us capital? . . . Why create with their own hands an even more terrible rival? For me it is evident that, in giving us capital, foreign countries commit a**  political error, and my only desire is that their blindness should continue for as long as possible.<sup>8</sup>

A number of Russian authors have made calculations concerning the role of foreign capital in Russia's development. According to figures cited by Lyashchenko, in 1900 about 28J per cent of the capital of private companies was foreign-owned, in 1913 about 33 per cent. During these years foreign capital invested in Russia increased by 85 per cent, while Russian capital increased by 60 per cent. While the growth of foreign investments thus somewhat exceeded that of native investments, the latter were none the less rising by a very substantial percentage at this time. Foreign capital was invested in varying degrees in the different industries; it was above all in the oil industry that the foreigners were dominant. However, according to Lyashchenko, they also provided about 42 per cent of the capital in the metal goods industries, 28 per cent in textiles, 50 per cent in chemicals, 37 per cent in woodworking. Russian banks formed close links with foreign banks, and were effective in the cartelization of Russian industry, through the creation of so-called Syndicates, which followed the depression of 1900-1903.

The investment of foreign capital in railway building and industry, and also successive loans, especially from France, to the Russian government, created a major problem for the Ministry of Finance to ensure a large enough surplus in visible trade to enable the necessary repayments, profit remittances and interest charges to be met. One consequence was the constant concern of the government to increase the export surplus of agricultural produce; this led to an effort to restrict consumption by the peasants and to increase sales by levying taxes on the peasants. Yet Russian industry, particularly in consumer goods, depended to a considerable extent on the purchasing power of the peasants for its market. This dilemma is by no means peculiar to Russia, and raises an issue of great interest in the economics of development. Russian economists brought up on the principles of the Manchester school used to assert, in their discussions after the abolition of serfdom in 1861, that the poverty of the peasants and the lack of a sufficient peasant market held back the development

of Russian industry, since it made industrial investment unprofitable. Yet Witte's policy of deliberately encouraging and sponsoring industrialization involved a reduction in peasant purchasing power as part of the means of compelling them to sell foodstuffs which they would rather themselves consume, in order to meet the material and financial requirements of industrialization. In the words of Gerschenkron: 'The problem of peasant demand lost its previous significance, and its relation to industrialization was thoroughly reversed .. . To reduce peasant consumption meant increasing the share of national output available for investment. It meant increased exports ... " There is more than a purely superficial similarity between the policy then pursued and that adopted by Stalin over thirty years later.

The government experienced great difficulty in raising sufficient revenue, particularly in years of war or of international tension. Despite its inadequate equipment, the Russian army was a particularly heavy drain on financial resources. It is therefore understandable that it was Witte who persuaded Tsar Nicholas II to call the first disarmament conference ever held, at The Hague in 1899.

Statistically speaking, industrial development was now proceeding at a satisfactory rate. However, the Russian Empire at the beginning of the twentieth century was beset by many dangers and was in a state of social and political disequilibrium. This arose in part out of the very fact of a rapid transformation of a formerly semi-feudal and agrarian society. Much of this instability arose from peasant attitudes, which we must now briefly examine.

# Agriculture and the Peasants

Th& abolition of serfdom in and after 1861 opened a new era in Russian social relations. Yet the settlement of that year caused a deep dissatisfaction. Rural unrest was still serious and contributed greatly to the revolutionary waves of the twentieth century. There were several reasons for this.

Firstly, under the settlement of 1861 the land was divided

between the landlords and the peasants. This offended the peasants' age-long sense of fairness. Serfdom had been imposed largely for state reasons, to provide an economic basis for the service gentry to enable them to serve the Tsar in civil and military capacities. They were in effect paid by the Tsar with land, and peasants had an obligation to maintain the gentry in the service of the Tsar. When in 1762 this duty of service was finally abandoned, this removed the only possible justification for the peasants' attachment to the land, as the peasants understood it. Let me illustrate the original *raison d'etre* of serfdom with a historical example. In 1571 a Tartar invasion from the Crimea caused many thousands of peasants and their families to be led away into slavery. To prevent a recurrence of these events a standing army was necessary, and a strong monarchy. Many peasants understood this. They were in a position to evade their obligations by moving eastwards and southwards across an open frontier, and in fact did so on a large scale during the wars of Ivan the Terrible, which reduced revenue, numbers of recruits and the value of land grants to the gentry. The peasants' attachment to the soil thus had a rational purpose. However, by the late eighteenth century the gentry had the right to become merely parasitic landlords (though in fact many of them did continue to serve the state in various capacities), while the majority of the peasants were reduced to a state of slavery. The belief survived among them that 'they were the lord's but the land was God's'. They disputed the legitimacy of the ownership of the land by the lords, and considered that those who cultivated the land should have the full use of it. They therefore saw the 1861 settlement as depriving them of land to which they had a legitimate right.

Secondly - adding insult to injury - they were obliged to purchase their share of the land in instalments (redemption dues).

Thirdly, the peasants did not achieve equality before the law, or real personal freedom. Their land was held not by them but by the village community. This institution was often known as the *mir* or the *obshchina.* The heads of families in the village controlled land utilization. In most parts of European Russia they periodically redistributed strips within a three-field system familiar to

students of medieval farming. The peasant was not allowed to leave his village without the authority of the community, and all the households of the village were jointly liable for taxes and for redemption dues.

Fourthly, a rapid increase in population pressed upon the means of subsistence. Towns were growing, but not at a rate sufficient to prevent a rapid growth in numbers of rural inhabitants, as the following figures demonstrate:

| European Russia |            |       |  |  |  |  |
|-----------------|------------|-------|--|--|--|--|
|                 | Urban      | Rural |  |  |  |  |
|                 | (millions) |       |  |  |  |  |
| 1863            | 6.1        | 55.3  |  |  |  |  |
| 1897            | 12.1       | 82.1  |  |  |  |  |

This trend continued after the turn of the century; it has been estimated that there was a 20 per cent increase in the rural population between 1900 and 1914. The size of peasant holdings and the traditional methods of cultivation made it increasingly difficult to feed the larger numbers, and there were insufficient incentives to use new methods. The situation was made worse by the imposition of taxes which were part of Witte's policy, mentioned above. It is true that there were lands available east of the Urals to which some of the surplus peasants could go, but resettlement was impeded by the joint responsibility of the village for taxes and redemption dues, which naturally led to fellow villagers refusing to allow individuals to leave.

Needless to say, the above are only broad generalizations, which did not have universal application. Thus in Siberia and in parts of northern Russia there had never been serfdom at all, and a self-reliant class of peasants developed there long before 1861 and continued thereafter. Many succeeded in leaving the villages despite legal restrictions on their movement. Some peasants made a lot of money. Readers of Chekhov will not need reminding that the man who bought the cherry orchard was a *nouveau riche* son of a serf. None the less the generalizations do broadly hold good, and the land problem was never far from the preoccupations of

**the** Tsar's ministers. Various proposals were made and postponed. It needed the shock of the 1905 revolution, with its widespread peasant Hots and land seizures, to force the government to realize that further delay was out of the question.

The reform was carried out by the Tsar's last efficient and intelligent minister, P. A. Stolypin, and a series of measures effecting these reforms were promulgated in the years 1906-11. Outstanding redemption dues, which had been reduced, were finally abolished. Peasants were now free to leave their communities, to consolidate their holdings as their property, to buy land or to sell it, to move to town or to migrate. Stolypin's object was to encourage the emergence of a class of peasant proprietors who would be prosperous, efficient and politically loyal. This was the so-called 'wager on the strong'. Many go-ahead peasants took advantage of the new opportunities. By 1916 about 2 million households had left the communities and set up private farms, out of 2.7 million who had expressed their desire to do so. This represented some 24 per cent of the households in forty affected provinces of European Russia. Some remained in the villages, others erected farm houses, so-called *khutora,* outside. The process of change was slowed down and then halted by the outbreak of war in 1914. Stolypin himself had been assassinated in 1911. He held the view that his reform, given time, would have provided the empire with a solid social base. We will never know whether he would have been proved right.

Commercial agriculture, conducted both by the progressive landlords and by the more prosperous peasants, was already developing in some areas even before this reform. It naturally speeded up thereafter. It is not surprising that the greatest number of peasants opted to leave the community in the southwest (i.e. principally in the Ukraine) and in the North Caucasus, where grain was produced for the market. It was in these areas that resistance to Stalinist collectivization was most fierce twenty years later.

The Stolypin reform made possible a major rearrangement of traditional peasant agriculture, and would certainly have led to greater efficiency and to a substantial strengthening of a prosperous peasant class. In fact this development was already in

progress. However, its political and social impact was conditioned by two other significant factors. The first was that the reform did not affect the assets of the landlords and the church. It is true that the richer peasants were purchasing some land from the poorer landlords, but it was no part of the object of this reform to redistribute the landlords' land. Consequently the grievances of the peasants as a whole, and their land hunger, were not assuaged. In fact half of the 89 million hectares of land allocated to the landlords in 1861 had passed into peasant hands by 1916; they owned by then 80 per cent of the land and rented part of the remainder,<sup>10</sup> but resentment against big landlords remained strong. Secondly, the poorer peasants received little benefit from the reform, except perhaps that they were now finding it easier to sell their smallholdings if they wished to leave. The effect was to increase the number of landless peasants and migration to the towns. It also stimulated hostility towards the better-off peasants, which was to be an important factor in the revolutionary period.

Agricultural production rose rapidly in the first years of the century, due partly to favourable weather conditions and partly to the effects of the reform and of better methods. While most peasants were still using outdated methods, including large numbers of wooden ploughs, the more progressive sectors were now beginning to use modern equipment. This process was greatly assisted by a sharp rise in agricultural prices, due in part to a rise in world prices. According to Lyashchenko the net income of agriculture increased by 88.6 per cent in the period 1900-13, representing an increased output in constant prices of 33.8 per cent. The spread of commercialism and of capitalist relations was speeding up. Exports of grain rose very sharply. Thus in the years 1911-13 they were 50 per cent higher than in the years 1901-5, on average. Exports of butter, eggs, flax and other agricultural products were also increasing. A protective tariff encouraged the development of cotton-growing in Central Asia.

But over the long period progress was not great. According to the invaluable Bairoch, productivity per head grew as follows, based on a calculation of millions of calories produced per male agricultural worker:

|                | i860    | 1910   |
|----------------|---------|--------|
| Germany        | 10.5    | 25.0   |
| Belgium        | 11.0    | 18.0   |
| Spain          | 11.0    | $8-5$  |
| $\mathbf{USA}$ | 225     | 42.0   |
| France         | $14-5$  | 17.0   |
| Italy          | $5 - 0$ | 65     |
| Japan          | 9       | 2.6    |
| UK             | 20.0    | $*3.5$ |
| Russia         | $7-5$   | 11.0   |
| Sweden         | 10.5    | 16.0   |
| Switzerland    | 9.0     | 17.0   |
|                |         |        |

Thus Russia moved one up on the ranking list, overtaking Spain, though only because Spain, so to speak, marched backwards. She fell farther behind the USA and Germany, but grew faster than either Great Britain or France

A similar picture emerges from the Goldsmith study already cited. His index for 'all crops'  $(1896-1900 = 100)$  shows an increase from an index of  $5\hat{1}$  in 1861 to an average of 140 in 1911-13 (fifty provinces of European Russia, i.e. excluding not only Siberia and Central Asia but also Finland, Poland and the Caucasus). Allowing for margins of error and misreporting of data, he obtains 'an average rate of growth of very close to 2 per cent' per annum for the whole period (though one cannot exclude if per cent or  $z$  per cent, depending on interpretation of the data). Livestock production, on which statistics for these years are totally inadequate, went up much more slowly; Goldsmith's estimate is only 1 per cent per annum, making an overall growth rate for agriculture of approximately 1.7 per cent per annum for the period 1860-1914. But such a figure is only a fraction above the rate of population increase. Food consumption per head could hardly have increased at all, if one takes into account the relative increase in the area sown with industrial crops, and also exports of food. Total farm output per head of the whole population rose perhaps \ per cent per annum. Goldsmith does not attempt to calculate output per head of population engaged in agriculture, but it is clear that his figures are broadly consistent with the picture derived from Bairoch's study.

This slow progress of agriculture, in which so high a proportion of the people was engaged, helps to explain the modest growth of the national income, already referred to. It is true, however, that food production was beginning to increase rather more rapidly towards the end of the period.

Progress in agricultural education was impressive in the last years of the regime. Thus there were only seventy-five students studying agronomy to degree level in 1895, but by 1912 the number had risen to 3,922;" not enough, of course, but evidence of a very big growth rate, which could well have paid off in time. Similarly, there was a most impressive rise in the various forms of agricultural cooperation, showing that, with the break-up of the *mir,* new and better ways of expanding peasant commercial activities were being devised. The membership of rural credit cooperatives rose from 181,000 in 1905 to 7 million in 1914. The number of rural consumer cooperatives rose in the same period from 348 to 8,877." Marketing cooperatives grew rapidly. One of these, which organized peasant butter producers in Siberia, maintained an agency in London and made great progress with exports. Thus the last decade of Tsardom may have been the harbinger of an agricultural leap forward. Needless to say, here too improvement was exceedingly uneven, affecting some parts of the country much more than others. Yet there was evidence here to support the pleas of those who, like Chayanov, believed in the productive potential of peasant agriculture.

# Social and Political Instability

The freeing of the peasants caused an ever-growing flow into the towns, and this was naturally speeded up by the Stolypin reform, since now peasants with little land could sell their holdings to their better-off neighbours. Most of the urban labour force was of extremely recent rural origin, and maintained close links with the villages, where many of their relatives still lived. Many went home annually to help bring in the harvest. The industrial labour force was thus not of high quality; skilled labour accustomed to factory work was relatively very scarce. Drunkenness was common, living conditions exceedingly primitive. This rootless and disorientated labour force found itself concentrated in the very large units of which the modern sector of Russian industry was composed, and provided good material for revolutionary propaganda in the cities.

It has often been stated that the Russians were almost all illiterate before the revolution. This statement is greatly exaggerated. In the 1897 census, it was found that, in European Russia, 35.8 per cent of the men and 12.4 per cent of women were literate. A good measure of progress is the record of literacy among army recruits:

*(per cent)*  **1875 — 21 1890 — 31 1905 — 58 1913 — 73**  *(Source: Bo? shay a Son Entsiklopediya,*  **2nd** edn, Vol. 12, p. **434.)** 

There was a rapid development of schools and of universities and the standards of science were high indeed. Here too the situation was characterized by extreme regional unevenness. Such medical services as existed were of excellent quality, but there were too few doctors. The death-rate in villages was appallingly high.

Thus it may be said that the Russian Empire in 1913 was in the process of rapid change, that industrialization was making good progress, that agriculture was also changing and growing, but progress was uneven and gave rise to social and political stress, which in turn caused unrest in the cities together with land-hunger and rioting in the villages. A Russian middle class was emerging, but it lacked authority and self-confidence. With rare exceptions, the servants of the autocracy were men of mediocre ability overwhelmed by ever-growing problems and unable to cope with a growing and changing empire. The intelligentsia, given to endless arguing and theorizing, was almost wholly opposed not only to the autocracy but also to the spirit of

capitalist enterprise. This was an explosive mixture. It is not only with the help of the evidence of hindsight that we can say that the society and the polity were in the process of breaking down. The following is an extract from a book by an Austrian observer, Hugo Ganz, published in 1904 and entitled *The Downfall of Russia.* It is said to be a conversation between Ganz himself and a senior official who asked to remain anonymous:

'What will be the end, then?'

'The end will be diat the terror from above will awaken the terror from below, that peasant revolts will break out and assassination will increase.'

'And is there no possibility of organizing the revolution so that it shall not rage senselessly?'

'Impossible...'

'There is no one with whom I have spoken who would fail to paint the future of this country in the darkest colours. Can there be no change of the fatal policy which is ruining the country?'

'Not before a great general catastrophe. When we shall be compelled for the first time partly to repudiate our debts - and that may happen sooner than we now believe - on that day, being no longer able to pay our old debts with new ones - for we shall no longer be able to conceal our internal bankruptcy from foreign countries and from the Emperor steps will be taken, perhaps ... '

'Is there no mistake possible here in what you are saying?'

'Whoever, like myself, has known the state kitchen for the last twenty-five years has no longer any doubts. The autocracy is not equal to the problems of a modern great power, and it would be against all historical precedent to assume that it would voluntarily yield without external pressure to a constitutional form of government.'

'We must wish then, for Russia's sake, that the catastrophe comes as quickly as possible.'

'I repeat to you that it is perhaps nearer than we all think or are willing to admit. That is the hope; that is our secret consolation .. . We are near to collapse, like an athlete with great muscles and perhaps incurable heart weakness. We still maintain ourselves upright by stimulants, by loans, which like all stimulants only help to ruin the system more quickly. With that we are a rich country with all conceivable natural resources, simply ill-governed and prevented from unlocking our resources. But is this the first time that quacks have ruined a Hercules that has fallen into their hands?'

I am far from suggesting that one can find ultimate wisdom in the words of a relatively unknown Austrian writer, or that such alarm and pessimism were universal at the time. The above quotation is merely an attempt to dispel the idea that the sense of doom was, so to speak, superimposed on the period by postrevolutionary analysts. Nor is it intended to deny that it was the outbreak of war in 1914 and its consequences that finally made the peaceful evolution of the empire totally impossible. Who knows, Nicholas II might have been succeeded by an ambitious and dominating Emperor, a kind of new Peter the Great, capable of enforcing the necessary adjustments. The 1905 revolution was apparently surmounted by the autocracy, with little loss of executive power. It is true that they found it necessary to concede the existence of an elective legislature, but in 1907 the franchise was so restricted as to ensure a loyal conservative majority. By 1914 a wave of strikes grew threateningly, and in the short run it was the outbreak of war that relieved the authorities of many of their worries by turning the mobs from subversion into patriotic demonstrations.

Thus the question of whether Russia would have become a modern industrial state but for the war and the revolution is in essence a meaningless one. One may say that statistically the answer is in the affirmative. If the growth rates characteristic of the period 1890-1913 for industry and agriculture were simply projected over the succeeding fifty years, no doubt citizens would be leading a reasonably comfortable existence and would have been spared many dreadful convulsions. However, this assumes not only that the tendencies towards military conflict which existed in Europe had been conjured out of existence, but also that the Imperial authorities would have successfully made the adjustment necessary to govern in an orderly manner a rapidly developing and changing society. There is no need to assume that everything that happened was inevitable because it happened. But there must surely be a limit to the game of what-might-have-

**been. One** can end this chapter with another quotation from Gerschenkron: 'Industrialization, the cost of which was largely defrayed by the peasantry, was itself a threat to political stability and hence to the continuation of the policy of industrialization.'"
