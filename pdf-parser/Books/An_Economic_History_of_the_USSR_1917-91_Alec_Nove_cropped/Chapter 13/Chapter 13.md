Brezhnev and Kosygin succeeded Khrushchev. They undid what they considered (not without reason) to be his wrong-headed reforms: the agricultural TPAs were eliminated, the normal raion administrative organs were reconstituted, the Ministry of Agriculture reappeared with its former powers, the division of the party between industrial and agricultural parts was abandoned, its unity restored. In September 1965 the *sovnarkhozy* were finally abolished, and the industrial ministries reappeared; Gosplan again became the key planning organ, covering both long-term and short-term planning. However, regional supply depots remained, under the authority of the State Committee on Material Supplies *(Gossnab).* The country was promised an end to 'hare-brained schemes' and constant reorganizations.

## Agriculture a Priority

The policies of the new leadership towards agriculture emerged in the March 1965 plenum of the central committee. There was severe criticism of past errors: excessive 'campaigning', neglect of the non-black-earth regions, restrictions on private livestock, inadequate supply of machinery, the unprofitability of the livestock sector. It was decided to increase procurement prices substantially, especially for livestock. In subsequent years there were further increases in prices, without any consequential rise in retail prices. As a result, there was a fundamental change in the role of agriculture in the economy. From being a source of accumulation of capital for investment in industry, agriculture became a net burden on the rest of the economy. The subsidy to cover losses in the livestock sector (i.e. the difference between the price paid to farms plus handling costs and receipts from retail sales) grew and grew. Investment in agriculture, both state and collective, rose substantially, both relatively and absolutely:

\* Productive and unproductive investments, including expenditure on repair workshops of SeFkhozlekhnika, research, establishments for processing farm products, irrigation works, etc. (Source: Nar. khoz, 1975, pp. 502, 510.)

Brezhnev affirmed and reaffirmed the high priority to be accorded to agriculture, and to industries serving the needs of agriculture. While scaling down Khrushchev's unrealistically overambitious targets for fertilizer production, he continued the policy of pressing ahead with the expansion of this and other sectors of the chemical industry.

With what result? One must try to eliminate the variations due to weather, which continue to have a large influence on the size of the harvest. Thus 1965, 1967, 1972, 1975 and 1979 were **poor** years, for reasons quite unconnected with plans and policies. The basic trend was upwards:

It may be said that, despite some recent slowdown, Soviet agricultural output had in fact risen faster than that of most other countries, especially Western countries. However, the situation was in fact deeply unsatisfactory, and this for the following reasons.

(1) The increases were from very low levels, of yields and productivity, and measured by international standards they were still very low.

(2) The increases were achieved at disproportionate cost. No major country devotes so high a proportion of its total investment to agriculture. Yet it still appears to be undercapitalized, due partly to unbalanced *(nekompleksnyt)* mechanization, partly to low quality of machines, and also to poor maintenance, so that equipment and vehicles wear out quickly.<sup>1</sup>

(3) The reduction of the labour force was slow, while pay both in *kolkhozy* and *sovkhozy* increased substantially. This led to a sharp rise in costs of production, which added to the burdens on the state budget through the ever-increasing subsidies which had to be paid. There was still a shortage of labour at peak periods, and millions of urban citizens and soldiers were drafted in to help bring in the harvest.

(4) Agriculture proved incapable of supplying enough food to cover rapidly growing demands from the now better-paid citizens, especially as the peasants themselves were eating better. Demand was artificially stimulated by the policy of low prices for food. Thus meat prices had been last increased in 1962, and since then average wages had than doubled. So even though production had gone up, shortages became more acute.

(5) The gap between supply and demand (especially of fodder grains, to sustain a larger livestock population) led to increased dependence on imports from the capitalist world. Thus in 1973, following the poor harvest of the previous year, imports of grain reached 23 million tons. They subsequently exceeded 40 million tons, since harvests in 1981-5 were poor. The average for grain (181 million tons) was well below the 1976-80 figure of 205, despite very large investments, including huge expenditures on land improvements, most of which seem to have been wasted.

It was often the case that successes in one sector were negatived

by failure to provide complementary resources. For example, fertilizer deliveries did rise rapidly, and this, together with increased expenditure on liming and land improvement, did contribute to the rise in the average harvests. However, as many sources showed, there were shortages of bags, means of transport, storage facilities and spreading machines. Also, the type of fertilizer delivered often did not accord with local requirements, and under these conditions it piled up at railway yards and much of it was wasted.

Economically, the Brezhnev period has to be seen as a disaster. *Net* output barely rose, despite record investments in machinery, livestock complexes and land 'melioration', while it proved necessary to mobilize millions of townspeople and soldiers every year to help with the harvest, owing to lopsided mechanization and the unwillingness of the peasants to put in the needed effort. According to E. Manevich, the number so mobilized doubled between 1970 and 1980, and reached the extraordinarily high figure of 15 million persons.<sup>2</sup> And this despite the fact that, by the standard of industrialized countries, the proportion of the working population engaged in agriculture was very high.

In the period 1970-85 there was an outflow of labour from some rural areas, especially in the 'non-black-earth' regions of central and north Russia. This was unintentionally stimulated by a policy of abandoning (or forcing the abandonment of) so-called *neperspektivnye* ('futureless') villages and hamlets. This was a sort of replay of Khrushchev's vision of 'agro-towns' referred to earlier (p. 312): peasants were to be moved into modern central urban-type settlements. However, the absence of hard-surface roads, and peasants' attachment to their surroundings, made this both inefficient and unpopular. Its scale can be judged by the fact that, as was reported by E. Yasin in *Kommunist* No. 12, 1987, p. 45, in the Kostroma province alone no less than a thousand villages and hamlets (!) were declared to be *neperspektivnye.* The availability to peasants of elementary amenities, adequate shops, health services and schooling were all the subject of severe criticisms, and efforts were being made to put things right.

In the late Brezhnev years there was a drastic overhaul of agricultural administration. Conscious of poor results, and of

wasteful use of resources by so-called service organizations (who fulfilled plans in millions of roubles instead of doing what the farms needed), it was decided to create a new hierarchy covering the entire 'agro-industrial complex'; its local organs became known as RAPO *{Rayonnoye agro-promyshlennoye obyedineniye).*  Its creation was a feature of a much-publicized food programme, adopted in May 1982. In its original form it failed to achieve the necessary coordination, and there was a further reorganization in 1985. It is now universally agreed that this bureaucratic solution was a serious error (a contemporary joke blames the creation of the RAPO on the CIA!). The net effect was the creation of another layer of controlling officials and a weakening of the position of farm management, which ought to have been free to hire (or not to hire) service agencies as sub-contractors.

The urgent and vital problem of motivating peasants to work was to be tackled by the creation of small work-groups working autonomously on contract and paid by results. In fact some experiments on these lines had been conducted in the late fifties and early sixties. An enterprising state-farm manager, Khudenko, made a brilliant success of such a scheme. However, he fell foul of the regulations and of the bureaucracy, was arrested and died in prison. (The story is told, with indignation, by V. Belkin and V. Perevedentsev in *Literaturnaya gazeta, 1* April 1987.) The final blessing of the politbureau for small-group contracts was announced by Gorbachev, at that time in charge of agriculture, in a speech in Belgorod in March 1983. This, however, made little headway. The later development of family leasing will be discussed in the next chapter.

# 'Reform' of Industrial Planning

A seemingly important reform was adopted in 1965 — a decree which had the declared intention of increasing managerial powers, reducing considerably the number of compulsory indicators 'passed down' from the centre. Prices were recalculated on the basis of cost plus a percentage of the value of capital assets, thus supposedly corresponding to Marx's 'price of production'. A major adjustment in prices was to eliminate losses in such sectors as coal and timber. A capital charge, averaging 6 per cent, was to be levied. This same decree finally eliminated the *sovnarkhozy*  and restored the industrial ministries with almost the pre*sovnarkhoz* powers, one important difference being the attempt to concentrate in *Gossnab* (the state material-technical supply committee) the function of disposal which departments of ministries formerly exercised. There was to be 'trade in means of production', i.e. a gradual scrapping of the administered system of material allocation (this was again proposed in 1987). Most of the ministries were all-union rather than union-republican; in other words, although there was a move towards greater devolution to management, the clear intention was to centralize planning and ministerial powers in Moscow. Republican and other regional planning organs lost powers.

It soon became evident that the reforms of 1965 were internally inconsistent. Ministerial powers over 'their' enterprises were those of superiors *vis-a-vis* subordinates, and orders could be, and were, issued on a wide variety of topics supposedly within the competence of management. Elaborate schemes intended to relate managerial bonuses, and payments into various incentive funds, to profitability and sales (disposals) were ineffective, for a variety of reasons. Thus plans were anything but stable, repeatedly altered within the period of their currency. The rules governing bonuses were changed arbitrarily and frequently. While management was supposed to be encouraged to aim high, success and bonuses still depended primarily on plan *fulfilment,* which meant that it always 'paid' to try to have a modest, 'fulfillable' plan. Persistent shortages of many inputs led to a number of negative phenomena: hoarding, over-application for material allocations, production and construction delays. It also meant that ministries and enterprises made their own supply and procurement arrangements, and unofficial 'expeditors' *(tolkachi)* supplemented the supply system by semi-legal deals. The stress on the profit motive, which seemed to be a feature of the 1965 reform, was also negatived by several factors: the fact that any additional profits were likely to be transferred to the budget (the 'free remainder', *svobodnyi ostatok pribyli),* the much greater stress on the fulfilment

of quantitative targets, and, finally, the inherent illogicality of using profits as a guideline when prices were uninfluenced by demand or need.

By 1970 not much was left of the additional managerial powers ostensibly granted by the 1965 reform. So the plans and policies of the decade of the seventies were applied within the traditional system of centralized planning, with multiple obligatory targets imposed on management, and administrative allocation of inputs; a task divided three ways: between Gosplan, Gossnab and ministries. As will be argued later in detail, the inherent impossibility of efficient and effective centralization underlay many if not most of the problems faced by the economy.

A so-called reform was promulgated in 1974, but this in no way tackled the fundamental issues. It was, on balance, a centralizing measure, with a multiplicity of compulsory plan-indicators imposed from above. One of them was to be 'normed value added', but this proved unworkable, and the much-criticized *val*  (gross value of output) survived along with targets in quantitative terms (tons, square metres, etc.). There was greater emphasis on the fulfilment of delivery obligations, but judging from subsequent criticisms it made little difference. Also during the seventies there was a move to merge enterprises into larger corporations or associations *(pbyedineniyd)* within the economic ministries. However, these associations were not endowed with any additional powers, and the concentration of responsibility for specific products within *obyedineniya* was impeded by the fact that many if not most goods were made in enterprises under several different ministries.

# Industrial Growth Slows Down

The targets of the eighth five-year plan (1966-70) may be seen in the table on page 386, together with those of the next two quinquennia. While ambitious, it avoided extremes. The outcome seemed satisfactory in aggregate. Aggregate growth rates were similar to those achieved in the previous quinquennium (50 per cent in 1966-^70, 51 per cent in 1961-5), with a relative improve-

ment in the growth of the output of consumers' goods (by 49 per cent, against 36 per cent in 1961—5)/ Some industries did notably well. Oil output rose by 45 per cent, with a large contribution from the newly-operational wells in north-west Siberia, fertilizer by over 100 per cent (though the plan target was even higher). Of course, this was due in large part to the investments made in earlier periods, but industry as well as agriculture benefited from greater stability, the restoration of habitual lines of command, the end of extremes of 'campaigning' so characteristic of the Khrushchev period.

On closer examination, the table gives grounds for some perplexity. How could the overall plan for national income and for industry have been over-fulfilled, when there were serious shortfalls in energy (except oil), steel, and indeed virtually every other product except footwear (agriculture was also short of its plan targets)? Of course, the usual warning is necessary: aggregate indices tend to exaggerate growth rates. But why should this factor be especially important in *this* quinquennium? One reason suggests itself: this was a period of a particularly rapid rise in military hardware production, which is included in the aggregate index of industrial production, but not in the physical-output statistics, which are confined to civilian production.

The same table shows a significant degree of under-fulfilment, even in terms of aggregate indices, as well as in key industrial sectors, in the period after 1970. The ninth five-year plan (1971- 5) envisaged an industrial growth rate almost as high as that previously claimed (47 per cent in the five years), with consumers' goods output slightly outpacing that of producers' goods. But this was not to be; the consumers' goods target proved far beyond reach, due partly to the shortfalls in agriculture (and so in the food industry), and partly to increasing delays in construction; the latter factor has become of great importance, with a persistent rise in the volume of uncompleted investments and in the time taken to bring new productive capacity into operation. The official index for national income showed an unusually large gap between plan ( + 38.6 per cent) and actual ( + 28 per cent). Since personal incomes rose faster than planned, shortages of consumers' goods grew gradually more acute.

These tendencies were even more noticeable in the tenth quinquennium (1976-80): a bigger gap still between the (already more modest) plan and its fulfilment, in aggregate and for almost every product of factory and mine. In 1980 only gas and passenger cars reached their five-year targets. Other sources of energy, and also steel, fertilizer, tractors, many other items of civilian machinery, locomotives, building materials, and virtually all consumers' goods, were far behind expectations.

#### A Pre-crisis Situation

All these unfavourable tendencies continued into the next quinquennium, which covered the last Brezhnev years and the brief reign of his two successors. The 1981-5 plan, the tenth, was significantly underfulfilled, even in terms of the (inflated) official indices, as the following table shows:

A substantial decline in the rate of growth of civilian machinery and equipment, and in investment, was partially concealed by the under-recording of price increases (for evidence and further analysis, see Appendix on growth rates). Obsolete machinery in urgent need of replacement continued in use, necessitating large expenditures on repairs. Technological progress slowed, imbalances multiplied. Speeches and articles, especially by Gorbachev himself, referred repeatedly to the spread of corruption, alcoholism, crime. The words 'pre-crisis situation' were his, and so were 'vears of stagnation'.

Living standards also stagnated, especially if one makes allowance for the understatement of price increases in the official index. Increases in money incomes were not matched by the rise in supplies in goods and services, which was reflected by the growing gap between official and free-market prices of foodstuffs, and by the very large rise in savings bank deposits, which Soviet sources treat as evidence of frustrated purchasing-power and suppressed inflation (though, oddly enough, some Western observers dispute this). The figures are clear enough.

A typical Soviet comment may be cited, by Academician O. Bogomolov. He wrote of'inflation... manifesting itself in growing shortages in retail trade and the growth of excessive frustrated purchasing-power. In the hope of acquiring the goods they needed the population accumulated money in savings banks or in moneyboxes.' In his view, prices rose not only in the free market but also, despite the official index, in state trade too. The urban consumers' basket more than doubled its price since the end of the fifties<sup>4</sup> (note that the official index showed a rise by only 7 per cent!).

Imbalances and shortages give rise to many undesirable sideeffects: corruption, bribery, under-the-counter sales, hoarding,

disregard for customer requirements. Several Soviet sources have pointed to the fact that stocks (inventories) held by enterprises rose much faster than output, immobilizing resources on a huge scale. So did the notorious *dolgostroi* ('longbuild'), the long delays in completing construction of all but the topmost priority projects. All these deficiencies grew worse in the last 'Brezhnev' years.

These difficulties were growing despite a very substantial bonus in the form of improved terms of trade. In the last Brezhnev years recourse was had (in secret) to the printing-press to cover a concealed budget deficit, the existence of which was first pointed to by Igor Birman.<sup>5</sup> Subsidies increased, as did (hidden) military expenditure. So did bank credits, which were part of what Kornai has called the 'soft budget constraint', i.e., management knew that any losses would be covered.

This was evidence of a developing crisis in the Soviet planning system. The following appear to be key elements of any explanation.

One element is demographic. Because of low birth-rates, the working population had virtually stopped increasing. Shortages of labour were serious, even though there was overmanning and waste in some sectors. The high birth-rate in Central Asia was of little help, since the native peoples tend to be immobile and to remain in their villages. Increased output now depended almost wholly on increased productivity per head.

This has been characterized by many in East and West as the need to shift from extensive to intensive growth. Technical progress, more and better mechanization and greater efficiency in the use of resources, become more and more vital.

The efforts to achieve parity in the military field added to the strain on resources. The military sector absorbed a large segment of the output of the Soviet machinery, engineering and electronic industries. In and after 1989 it was admitted that the published defence expenditures were far below the true ones, that the real figure was four times higher. But some Soviet critics maintain that the real figure was higher still,<sup>6</sup> and 'blame' the high level of military spending for the neglect of the modernization of civilian industry. The military burden certainly made an appreciable contribution to the troubles of the economy.

A further drain on resources had been the big investment effort in agriculture, already referred to. Of perhaps even greater importance were the magnitude and cost of investments in Siberia. These investments were undoubtedly necessary: vast resources of energy and many valuable minerals lie in the largely empty and climatically unpleasant areas north of the Trans-Siberian railway. It has been repeatedly pointed out that while 90 per cent of energy utilization is west of the Urals, 90 per cent of energy resources are east of the Urals. With the exhaustion of oil wells in European areas, it is essential to rely increasingly on Siberian sources, and the richest sources of natural gas lie in the frozen north-west of Siberia. But these investments are very costly, even while in the longer run their importance will be very great.

All this presented a challenge to the 'traditional' centralized planning system, much more attuned to quantity than to quality, poor at relating production to user demand, and, above all, increasingly overwhelmed by its own complexity. Inefficiency and waste, the slow diffusion of technical progress, imbalances and bottlenecks, plagued the economy. The party leadership continued to adopt resolutions demanding greater attention to the requirements of the customer, whether the customer be industry itself or the citizen. However, production continued to adapt itself not to user demand but to the 'success indicators', i.e. to plan-fulfilment statistics in roubles, tons, square metres. It has proved extremely difficult to incorporate desirable forms of technical progress into 'directive' plan-orders. New products or new machines required to be approved by numerous bureaucratic instances, and then fitted into plan target figures, and the allocated material inputs frequently failed to match requirements. Information flows were distorted by the interest of informationproviders in being given a plan that was easy to fulfil. Unreliability of supplies encouraged hoarding and over-application for input allocations; frequent changes of plan encouraged the hoarding of labour too. Brezhnev complained of the strength of what he called *vedomstvennost'* and *mestnichestvo,* 'departmentalism' and 'localism': ministries, and regional state and party organs, diverted resources in the light of their sectional interests, made their own components (often in ill-equipped backyard workshops), and

proved too strong for the overworked coordinating organs. Far too many investment projects were begun, despite repeated orders to stop this practice. Plans were too often unbalanced, in that the necessary inputs could not be provided or did not arrive, and in the most recent years a serious bottleneck has been rajl transport. The many calls on resources greatly reduced the rate of growth of investment; in 1979, a particularly difficult year, it was only 1 per cent. In fact the volume of investment declined, owing to increased costs and prices.

As Brezhnev himself grew older, so did his increasingly geriatric colleagues in the leadership. One had an increasing sense of paralysis in the face of the need for action. His death brought the reform-minded Andropov to power, but his health collapsed before he could make an impact. The brief period during which Chernenko was general secretary represented the last futile attempt of the older generation, which came politically of age under Stalin, to cling to the old ways. Gorbachev was already waiting in the wings.

# Foreign Trade, Comecon and Detente

A feature of the Brezhnev period was a substantial expansion of Soviet foreign trade, particularly with the capitalist world. This was facilitated by an improved political atmosphere ('detente'), which encouraged Western firms and banks to grant long-term credits on a large scale, and, from 1973, also by the rise in prices of oil (by far the largest Soviet export to the West) and some other commodities, as well as of gold. Soviet purchases of Western (and Japanese) technology increased very sharply, and there were also large purchases of grain. Soviet aid programmes for developing countries did not expand, but trade grew, especially Soviet sales of arms to third-world countries.

Efforts were also made to enlarge the functions of Comecon. In 1971 an ambitious programme of integration was formally adopted, but, while the volume of trade expanded, it remained predominantly bilateral, with only slow progress in joint planning of investments. Though there was formal provision for convertibil-

fry, in practice the currencies remained non-convertible, and the so-called transferable rouble was a unit of account and not in fact transferable. In the most recent years the USSR, as the major supplier of fuel and material to the industrialized members of Comecon, faced a dilemma: with the slowdown of growth of output, it has not been possible to supply the needs of the Comecon partners - for instance for oil - without adversely affecting earnings from sales to Western markets and/or failing to cope with rising domestic demand. Comecon countries then had to buy more oil and other commodities (for instance, grain) for hard currency in the capitalist world, and therefore to export more to the West, which acted against closer integration with the USSR and the other Comecon partners.

The table opposite shows the scale on which trade had increased, with all categories of countries. The figures given are in current prices, and of course were greatly influenced by the rise in the price of oil, by far the largest item in Soviet exports. The agreement on prices with Comecon countries (that prices be a sliding average of the previous five years) meant that for a number of years they were able to buy Soviet oil and gas at prices well below the rapidly rising world prices, which led some commentators to assert that the USSR was subsidizing its Comecon partners on a large scale. However, the same rules led to a reverse situation in 1986, when world prices fell.

It was sometimes said that Brezhnev embarked on a policy of detente in order to secure economic advantages. This is a political and an economic misinterpretation. Soviet gains from trade were due decisively to the fortuitous combination of a large rise in domestic output in oil (and gas) and an even larger increase in the world price. These gains continued into the eighties, but were partially reversed. Oil output began to stagnate, and world prices fell. This led to a sharp drop in Soviet hard-currency earnings, in 1985 and 1986, and to some fall in Soviet purchases.
