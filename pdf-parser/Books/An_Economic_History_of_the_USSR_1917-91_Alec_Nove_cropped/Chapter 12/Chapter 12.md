# **12 The Khrushchev Era**

The Malenkov Interregnum

Malenkov had presented the principal report at the nineteenth party congress, in October 1952. He, with Molotov and the security chief, Beria, formed a triumvirate when Stalin died. The means by which Malenkov, who seemed to be the appointed heir, was manoeuvred out of this position belong strictly to the realm of politics. Khrushchev had already become in March 1953 the senior of the party secretaries. This, plus the fact that Khrushchev's experience inclined him to work in and through the party machine, undoubtedly affected economic administration, and the relation between governmental and party organs at all levels in the years that followed.

Malenkov held on to the chairmanship of the Council of Ministers, and at first exercised a leading role in economic policy, except perhaps for agriculture, where his particular contribution to the reforms of 1953 is still obscure, for reasons to be noted.

Before discussing Malenkov's policies, we must note briefly a sudden but short-term change in the ministerial structure, affecting the economy and all other branches of administration. It seems that, in the aftermath of the dictator's death, the politbureau members decided to appoint key party leaders to head ministries, and for this purpose amalgamated the ministries. Thus the Ministries of Agriculture, State Farms, Cotton-growing (such a ministry was set up in 1950), Procurements and Forestry were combined. So were the Ministries of Light, Fish, Food and Meat and Dairy Industries. So were those responsible for Ferrous and Non-ferrous Metals. The many ministries in the machinery and engineering sector (other than arms) were combined into only two, and so on.<sup>1</sup> This arrangement did not last long. The number of economic ministries began to grow again within six months, probably under the combined pressure of business and of Khrushchev's interest in weakening decision-making through ministries, though their exact number and coverage changed in the course of their disaggregation. One change proved more durable: the transfer back to Gosplan of the material-supply function (carried out since the end of 1947 by Gossnab for industrial materials, and since 1951 by Gosprodsnab in respect of consumers' goods). We shall see that Gosplan's key role involved so great a burden of responsibility that it was later again divided and re-divided, but not until 1965 was something very like Gossnab re-created, under very different conditions.

On 11 April 1953 a decree of the Council of Ministers increased the power of decision-making of ministries (and of glavki heads). They could, within stated limits, alter staff establishment of their own enterprises, redistribute equipment, materials and resources, approve plans for small- and medium-scale investment, and so on. Readers of the decree were perhaps surprised how few of such decisions were within the competence of ministries before this date. No doubt the decree was partly due to the fact that senior party leaders were now ministers, and many ex-ministers were now heads of glavki. However, these powers were somewhat enlarged after 1954, and it may be that this caused a weakness in coordination which led to the drastic reforms of 1957.

The collective leadership quickly came to the conclusion that the quality and quantity of consumers' goods, of housing, of services, the depressed state of the villages and of agriculture, insistently called for remedy. Furthermore, it was essential to show the people that this was indeed their intention. Politicalstruggle considerations played their role. Thus Malenkov came to be identified in the public mind with a consumer-orientated policy, no doubt deliberately. However, even Beria, the grim police chief, was said to have advocated a 'consumer' policy, in the few months before his comrades had him arrested and shot (for quite other reasons). The wind of change was blowing powerfully.

But material concessions require material means to implement

them. One cannot increase consumption without providing more goods and services. The first steps of Malenkov suggested that he was willing to ignore this simple truth. Retail price cuts were announced on 1 April 1953, and they far exceeded the justifiable. On average, retail prices fell by 10 per cent, but many items were reduced by much more than this, without good reason. A 15 per cent cut in meat prices, for instance, made no sense when meat was short. Even more absurd was a 50 per cent reduction in prices of potatoes and vegetables. The result, as might have been foreseen, was queues for many goods, and an increasing gap between official and free-market prices, a disparity which reached 34 per cent on average in  $1954$ ,<sup>2</sup> and which was 100-150 per cent for potatoes and vegetables (in 1955 their prices were increased to more reasonable dimensions). A retail price policy which, in the interests of publicity, ignored supply-and-demand considerations so completely was bound to increase the already great deficiencies of the trade network.

Another 'popular' act of Malenkov made matters worse. The 'compulsory-voluntary' bond sales were sharply reduced, from 35.7 milliards in 1952 to 15.3 milliards in 1953. This, together with a 3 per cent rise in average wages in that year, led to an increase in take-home pay of no less than 8 per cent and so contributed to the gap between purchasing power and goods available at established prices. $^{3}$ 

The budget for 1953 was adopted unusually late, on 8 August. Its oddities must be briefly noted. It included an item of *expenditure*, 43.2 milliards, being the 'cost' of retail price cuts, and another 13.6 milliards representing the 'cost' of higher agricultural procurement prices and of agricultural tax cuts, about to be announced. Never before had decisions leading to loss of revenue - for all the above items represent revenue foregone - appeared in the budget as items of expenditure. Similar items appeared in the 1954 budget, but never again after Malenkov's fall.

Malenkov it was who announced, in his speech to the budget session of the Supreme Soviet in August, not only a reduction in agricultural tax but also the decision to raise procurement prices and to make sweeping changes in agricultural policy, details of which were to be announced by Khrushchev at the plenum of the central committee of the party in the following month (and which will be analysed at length when we discuss agriculture). When Malenkov resigned, it was stated that he was not the initiator of agricultural reforms, indeed that he had responsibility for the bad policies of the past. But by then he was in no position to defend himself, so we cannot know the truth. His views during Stalin's lifetime may simply have been a reflection of his superior's. What is one to make of Malenkov's announcement, in October 1952, that the grain problem was finally solved with a harvest of 130 million tons, when in August 1953 he stated that harvests had been greatly exaggerated by the 'biological yield' statistics? Did he not know in 1952 that his figures were quite misleading?

Malenkov propounded a new industrial policy. He held that, based on the successful creation of a powerful heavy industry, it now was both possible and desirable to speed the growth in the output of consumers' goods. It was to expand even faster than that of producers' goods. On 28 October 1953 *Pravda* announced new accelerated plans for expanding the output of the consumers' goods industries, over and above the provisions of the five-year plan, and ambitious targets were announced for 1954 and 1955, covering a wide range of goods. The table opposite illustrates the scale of the proposed increases, and the extent to which they exceeded reality.

Investments in industrial consumers' goods production in 1954 were planned at 5.85 milliard roubles, against only 3.14 milliard in 1953-

To meet the increased demand, every effort was made to achieve an immediate rise in consumable output. In 1953 consumers' goods production increased faster than that of producers' goods (13 per cent against 12 per cent, according to the official statistics). Total investment rose very little, by only 4 per cent, as the economy adjusted itself to new policies. In April 1954 there was a further reduction in retail prices. However, following the mediocre harvest of 1953, the reductions were almost wholly confined to manufactured goods (e.g. cotton fabrics by almost 15 per cent). The one significant cut in foodstuffs affected bread, which, at 1.12 roubles, was now a third of the price-ruling in 1947. This further over-stimulated demand for all goods.

The increased plans for consumers' goods were over-ambitious and were abandoned quickly after Malenkov's fall.

One simple but popular reform was announced on 29 August 1953. It laid down normal working hours in all offices, especially government offices. Stalin worked at night, and in consequence officials had to adjust their hours, so that many hardly ever saw their families, since they had to stay at their desks in case the boss or one of his underlings made an inquiry. At long last, this distortion was over.

Stalin's successors also declared an amnesty. The big releases of political prisoners did not occur until 1955, but the dismissal and death of Beria was followed by a drastic curtailment of police powers and the liquidation of the security authorities' economic empire.

Before attempting any assessment of the Malenkov period, we must look at the far-reaching agricultural reforms launched in 1953-4, the first instalment of a series of changes.

## Agriculture 1953-4: Khrushchev's Emergence

The changes foreshadowed by Malenkov's speech at the Supreme Soviet were announced by Khrushchev in a speech which showed him to be a key figure in the post-Stalin political arena. The central committee which heard him and approved his proposals also gave him the formal rank of first secretary (later First secretary, the capital letter being, as they say, 'not accidental').

He began by making the first frank statement since collectivization concerning the state of Soviet farming. Productivity (per hectare, per cow, per peasant) was much too low. Livestock herds compared very unfavourably with 1928 and even 1916. The truth was hidden by statistical distortions, such as biological yield (though corrected figures were not then published; in the period 1953 to 1959 grain statistics were kept secret). Peasants were paid too little, and investments by farms were inadequate. This was due to the fact that procurement prices were far too low. Taxes on private plots were having the effect of discouraging production and harming peasant interests. Agricultural planning was defective and bureaucratic, procurement quotas were arbitrarily altered by local officials. These and other defects were to be put right 'in the next 2-3 years' (Khrushchev was always to be in a **hurry).** 

There followed a stream of measures designed to transform the situation. These can be classified under the following heads:

#### (a) *Prices*

There were very marked increases in compulsory-procurement prices and over-quota delivery prices for grain, potatoes and vegetables, meat, dairy produce, sunflower seed; smaller increases affected eggs and 'contract' prices for flax. At the same time the procurement quotas were reduced in a number of cases, so that a larger proportion of sales to the state took place at the higher over-quota delivery prices. In the full year 1954 the average prices paid by the state for produce were as follows:

| (1952 = 100)                             | 1954 |
|------------------------------------------|------|
| All grains (average)                     | 739  |
| Flax<br>fibre                            | 166  |
| Sunflower                                | 626  |
| Potatoes                                 | 369  |
| Meat, all types (average)                | 579  |
| Dairy produce (average, milk equivalent) | 289  |
| Raw cotton                               | 102  |

*(Source:* **Malafeyev,** *Istoriya tsenoobrazovaniya v SSSR* **(Moscow, 1964), pp. 412-13.)** 

The effect of all this on the net revenue of kolkhozes requires careful assessment. Thus at least half of all grain deliveries were in payment for MTS services and so had no price at all. Increases in *total* state purchases, albeit at higher prices, sometimes cut down the amount available for sale in the free market at still higher prices. None the less, it is quite undeniable that the net effect was positive and appreciable.

It will be noted that commodities previously well treated, such as cotton, did not benefit from price increases. So heavy was their 'weight' in total procurements that the average price paid for *all*  products in 1954 was only just over double that of 1952.

These prices were somewhat modified in 1955-6, the average being reduced somewhat for grain, greatly increased for potatoes, vegetables, sugar-beet. The average procurement prices for all products rose from 207 in 1954 (1952 = 100) to 251 in 1956.<sup>4</sup>

#### *(b) Other material concessions to kolkhozes*

The state was now to pay most or all of the transport costs involved in delivering produce to collecting points. Market charges were reduced. Past debts in cash or produce of kolkhozes to the state were written off. Payments for the work of the MTS were to be based on regionally differentiated fixed amounts, and no longer on percentages of the (usually exaggerated) harvest. Kolkhozes were, by the decree of 25 August 1953, to be increasingly linked with the public electricity generation system.

#### **338 The Khrushchev Era**

#### *(c*) *New policy towards private plots*

Tax was not only reduced substantially, so that its yield in 1954 was 60 per cent below the level of 1952, but its basis was altered. No longer did possession of an animal or the sowing of a particular crop attract tax on the theoretical income deemed to arise from them. The tax was levied henceforth on the area of the plot, differentiated by region. (It is noteworthy that the rate was lower, usually half of the usual rate, in the case of all territories annexed by the USSR in 1939-40, in which collectivization was completed in 1950.) Peasants were encouraged to acquire livestock, promised better pasture facilities. Peasant families without livestock were freed from compulsory deliveries of meat, and all such deliveries by peasants were reduced. Of course, the peasants benefited along with kolkhozes from the higher prices paid by the state, but more important was their freedom to eat more of their own produce or to take it to market (in which market dues were cut).

#### *(d) Increased inputs and investments*

A large increase was announced in the planned output of tractors and other farm machinery, also in fertilizer. It would be necessary to provide more building materials to make a reality of an expanded investment programme on the farms.

#### *(e) Discipline*

So as to have the necessary labour available for higher output and investment, despite the counter-attraction of the private plot, the power of farms to compel their members to perform their duties was enhanced, until in March 1956 the principle of centrally determined compulsory minima of collective work was dropped altogether, and kolkhoz managements were empowered to fix the work minima required to fulfil plans for collective production. Penalties could include a reduction in the area of the private plot.

### *(f) Planning, personnel and the role of the MTS*

There were injunctions to officials to take local conditions into account, to consult the kolkhoz management. Many qualified agronomists, administrators and other specialists were encouraged or directed into agriculture. The MTS permanent staff was greatly strengthened in quality and numbers, and many of the part-time employees hitherto borrowed for particular tasks from kolkhozes were to be employed permanently. The MTS dvCQ&K was to have important (but unfortunately ill-defined) supervisory powers over the kolkhozes served by him, and the party in rural areas was reorganized so that it exercised its great powers of control through 'secretaries for the MTS zone'; that is to say, a full-time party secretary, under the first secretary of the raion (district), was based on the MTS and was responsible for the party's control over kolkhozes within that MTS's service area, along with the kolkhoz party groups. The deputy-director, political, of the MTS was therefore superseded or replaced by this new system. At the same time the Ministry of Agriculture continued for several years to be in charge of agricultural planning, through republican, *oblast'* (provincial) and raion agricultural administrations. (This parallelism led, as we shall see, to several more reorganizations.)

The net effect of these measures on incentives and on investment was positive. We shall be assessing the first five years of Khrushchev's agricultural policies later in this chapter. The measures were accompanied by ambitious new production targets and plans for increasing livestock numbers.<sup>5</sup>

However, these quickly ran into difficulties; there was too little fodder, and, particularly, far too little fodder grain. A plenum of the central committee was devoted to this subject at the end of February 1954. (Note how agricultural decisions tended to be made at party plenums.) Khrushchev made another big speech. It was decided to increase state procurements of grain through all channels, by 35-40 per cent. Everything was to be concentrated on getting quick results; the phrase 'in the next 2-3 years' occurs repeatedly in the resolution of the plenum. Measures to increase yields take time, the building of many new fertilizer factories is a

slow business. The alternative: a spectacular expansion of sown area. This led Khrushchev to revive and then expand a plan which had already been adopted (but not put into effect) in 1940:' to bring under cultivation at least 13 million hectares of virgin and fallow land located on the southern fringes of the area of adequate rainfall, in northern Kazakhstan, the southern parts of Siberia, the south-east of European Russia. This decision was followed by another decree devoted solely to this theme.<sup>7</sup> It so happened that 1954 was a good year climatically in the regions concerned, the harvest was good on the relatively small area which could be sown that year, so the plan was more than doubled, to 28-30 million hectares.<sup>8</sup>

This became a great campaign. The young communist organization *(Komsomol)* was mobilized to encourage young persons to go east. Some volunteered, others went after it had been announced that this 'vital task set by the party and government' was 'an important patriotic duty'. Many went for two months to cope with the harvest peak: 200,000 were to go in 1956.<sup>9</sup> Much of the new cultivation was undertaken by state farms, since it was hardly realistic to expect people to go to work in a new and largely empty area, with a high drought risk, without an assured income and considerable state-financed investments. (Kolkhozes already existing in the area of the campaign greatly expanded sowing but few new ones were erected.) Between 1953 and 1956 the amount of cultivated land was increased by 35.9 million hectares, an area equivalent to the total cultivated land of Canada. World history knows nothing like it.

The number of migrants to the newly cultivated areas cannot be precisely determined (and some returned), but perhaps as many as 300,000 persons moved permanently. At first conditions were primitive, and for many years the press printed complaints about lack of housing, shops, amenities. The campaign also required the transfer of tractors, combine-harvesters and other machines, since the big new farms had to be highly mechanized if the job was to be done with the minimum of labour. It was also necessary to build new railway lines. All this naturally required resources of which the old-established regions were deprived.

The year 1955 was one of drought. I visited northern Kazakh-

stan in that year and saw some of the new farms under unfavourable conditions. However, 1956 produced good weather and an excellent harvest. The area is highly vulnerable to drought, and suffers from a short growing season, and the winter snow cover is insufficient to permit autumn sowing as frost would kill the plants. So there is a great rush to sow in the spring, soon enough to enable the grain to ripen. The aim was to grow grain, and almost all the land was sown with spring wheat. Because it was a party campaign, local officials vied with one another to plough up most land, and some quite unsuitable soils were brought under cultivation. We shall see that dangers of monoculture and soil erosion were ignored for too long.

The addition of so much new land sown to wheat led Khrushchev to the second stage of his grain campaign: to provide fodder grain and concentrates in the principal livestock areas, i.e. in European territories of the USSR. The crop he preferred was maize. So the central committee plenum of January 1955 accepted Khrushchev's proposals to increase the area under maize 'in the next 2-3 years' from 3.5 to no less than 28 million hectares. More food grains for human consumption from the virgin lands would leave scope for the use of more land in European territories of the USSR for the fodder grain which promised the highest yields per hectare, maize (i.e. corn).

The maize campaign, with which Khrushchev's name was particularly closely associated, will receive further analysis later in this chapter.

## The Fall of Malenkov

The policies outlined in the preceding pages were bound to lead to overstrain. Higher incomes in town and country, higher production and investment plans for consumers' goods, large agricultural programmes, an expansion of house-building and other consumer services, and simultaneously the continued growth of basic industry and the insistence of the military that the great US superiority in aircraft and in bombs required rectifying, this was too vast a programme to sustain. Malenkov's regime, sapped politically by Khrushchev, fell because he was never strong enough to adjudicate between conflicting claimants on resources. Exactly what finally decided the majority of the leadership to get rid of Malenkov is still not clear, since no sort of open discussion took place.

We know, however, that the occasion of his disgrace was the allegedly incorrect views he held concerning the priority (or rather, lack of priority) of heavy industry, of producers' goods as against consumers' goods. This was a principal accusation against him on the occasion of his resignation in February 1955. Coincidentally, *Voprosy ekonomiki* published, in its January number, a slashing attack on these 'woe-begone economists' who had made the error of climbing on to the bandwagon and who had produced arguments in favour of the more rapid growth of consumers' goods output.

It would be quite misleading to conclude that Khrushchev was against consumers' goods, since his very ambitious and expensive agricultural programmes would, if successful, provide food, which is a consumers' product *par excellence.* Khrushchev allied himself with those planners and military men who considered that Malenkov was unbalancing the economy by an over-concentration on industrial consumers' goods, and thereafter he proceeded to emphasize the citizen's material interests; this was a political necessity after Stalin's death. It is also perhaps worth saying that no one, not even Stalin, was against a higher standard of living. All would welcome it, but for long periods other preoccupations took priority.

Malenkov was succeeded as prime minister by Bulganin. Khrushchev was dominant in his position as First secretary, but, though until his fall he took practically every major policy initiative, he never achieved (if indeed he sought) the total dominance of a Stalin, and a number of steps taken in the period 1955-64 are explicable only by the fact that he could not always ride rough-shod over the opinions of his colleagues.

## Further Agricultural Reforms and Successes

Khrushchev used his enhanced political powers to press ahead with his agricultural policies, and it must be admitted that until

1958 output did rise substantially. Many analysts have expressed some suspicion about the statistics. The inflated figures of the past, especially the most recent past, may have been too drastically scaled down. The pressure on local party secretaries to report success may have led to exaggerations in reporting. Examples of such exaggerations have been reported from time to time, such as buying butter or meat in shops to deliver it to the state as new production, or including in grain output what Khrushchev himself once described as 'mud, ice, snow and unthreshed stalks',<sup>10</sup> and other plan-fulfilment reporting devices of varying degrees of ingenuity. While on occasion there is clearly a case for adding a pinch of salt to official claims, no one doubts that both production and procurements did rise in the period, allowing for the inevitable year-by-year variations due to weather.

In March 1955 a decree ostensibly enlarged the decisionmaking powers of the kolkhozes. Plans henceforth would specify delivery obligations, not production; the extent of sown areas and livestock numbers were to be a matter for kolkhozes to decide. An end must be put to centralized decisions about what each kolkhoz should do. The job of assessing and reconciling draft plans received from below was given to Gosplan. This was the first of many blows to the powers of the Ministry of Agriculture. In practice, as later evidence shows, detailed regulation from above continued, but primarily via local party organs. As we shall see, most of the interference with kolkhozes was due to campaigns initiated by Khrushchev himself. Supervision within kolkhozes was facilitated by a campaign, begun in March 1958, to send to the villages, as kolkhoz chairmen, reliable party men from the towns. These were by no means necessarily specialists in agriculture, but they were given 'a three weeks' initial course and two months' training on the job *(stazhirovka)\<sup>n</sup>*

The twentieth party congress approved, in February 1956, the sixth five-year plan, and one of its objectives for i960 was a grain harvest of 180 million tons, and more maize. This was but one more of the over-ambitious objectives set before agriculture. In 1957 the campaign began to catch up the United States in the production of meat, milk and butter. In the case of meat this would mean at least trebling Soviet output. We shall be examining the harm done by endeavours to fulfil such impossible plans as these and to impose them on the farms. Khrushchev himself toured the country, talking to officials and peasants, cajoling, haranguing, sometimes dismissing. Thus on 8 March 1957 he was in Krasnodar, on 10 March at a meeting at Rostov, at the end of the month he was addressing officials of the central region in Moscow. On 2 April he was in Voronezh, supporting the promise of a kolkhoz chairman to increase spectacularly output of meat and milk per 100 hectares (with extraordinary indifference to considerations of cost, prices, labour inputs). Five days later Khrushchev was in Gorky on the meat and milk campaign. Yet at this very time, as we shall see, Khrushchev was engaged not only in pushing through an immense industrial-planning reform, but was also under heavy attack from his political enemies. This, with all its defects, was a form of leadership very unlike Stalin's.

An important development began to gather speed during 1957: this was the transformation ('voluntary', of course, except that it was party-directed) of kolkhozes into state farms. In some cases it was a consequence of efforts to create vegetable-and-dairy state farms around big cities. In others economically weak and depressed kolkhozes were made into state farms. In still others, local party secretaries pressed ahead with conversions, either because they believed it to be party policy, or because it was easier to obtain financial help from Moscow for state farms. The statistics of change are as follows (the increase between 1953-6 being principally in the virgin lands):

| State farms <sup>*</sup> |
|--------------------------|
|                          |

|                                        | 1953 | 1956 | 1965       |
|----------------------------------------|------|------|------------|
| Total area sown (million ha.)          | 18.2 | 35.3 | $97-43$    |
| Total labour employed (millions)       | 2.6  | 29   | 8.6        |
| Loss to collective farms (million ha.) |      |      |            |
| $(1956-65)$                            |      |      | $(_47.!)t$ |
| Loss to collective farms (million      |      |      |            |
| households) (1956-65)                  |      |      | (4.5)!     |

\* Including other forms of state enterprise, t These figures give the decline in the period, regardless of cause. (Sources: Nar. khoz., 1965, pp. 288,455; SeFskoe khozyaistvo (i960), p. 46.)

Kolkhoz amalgamations were being pressed at the same time. After the first wave of amalgamations at the end of 1950 there were 125,000. In 1958 numbers of kolkhozes fell to 69,100 and continued to decline, and their size to increase, despite some criticism of unmanageability of big farms in areas of scattered small villages. By 1980 there were 36,000.

How did all these changes affect the incomes of kolkhoz peasants? Cash distributions rose from a total 12.4 to 47.8 milliard roubles, or from 1.40 to 4.00 roubles per trudoden', from 1952 to 1957.<sup>12</sup> The practice of making 'advances', i.e. regular payments at frequent intervals (every month or every quarter) in advance and on account of the end-year distribution, became the practice in the majority of kolkhozes. Payments in kind, on the other hand, increased little if at all, because of the pressure to deliver produce to the state, a pressure which, despite repeated promises and injunctions to the contrary, was still arbitrarily increased by local officials whenever the procurement plan for the area was endangered. Indeed, all too frequently party secretaries undertook to increase the planned deliveries and all too often one read that 'overplan deliveries are continuing', as if this should have been a source of pride - which it could have been, had the deliveries been voluntary and had there been enough left for the needs of the village.

The combined income in cash and kind from collective work rose from 47.5 milliards in 1952 to 83.8 milliards in 1957," or roughly from 5.40 to 7.55 roubles per trudoden' *{old*  roubles).

Peasant consumption of their own produce certainly rose. Private livestock holdings increased, and so private output of meat in 1958 was 35 per cent higher than in 1953, milk over 25 per cent higher. From 1 January 1958 private plots were freed of all compulsory delivery obligations. Sales in the free market fell from 53.7 to 39.6 milliard roubles between 1952 and 1957, perhaps because of lack of time to get to market as a result of tighter control over members' time. It is true that there developed a new facility: 'commission trading' by cooperatives, selling peasants' (and kolkhozes') surplus on their behalf in the market, usually at prices a little below those ruling in the free market. But

#### **Further Agricultural Reforms and Successes 347**

this sensible idea made only slow progress, due partly to lack of enterprise by the cooperatives and partly to peasant distrust. It should be mentioned that for the peasant a journey to town meant an opportunity to buy manufactured goods which were not available in the rural trading network. So the very substantial increase in cash payments for collective work, and of consumption by peasants of their own produce, was to some extent balanced by insignificant increases in payments-in-kind and a decline in the value of market sales.

The effect on incomes of a transfer to state-farm status depended greatly on the circumstances. It will be recalled that kolkhoz incomes varied very widely, as did opportunities to earn extra by free-market sales. In general an average state-farm wage of 531 (old) roubles per month in 1958,<sup>14</sup> plus social security benefits to which kolkhoz peasants were not entitled, was certainly a means of bettering one's lot. However, some relatively prosperous kolkhozes were forcibly converted, to their members' chagrin, and once they had become state-farm workers the peasants quickly found that their private plots and animals were subject to severe limitations.

In fact, already in 1956 there had appeared the first sign **that**  the development of the private sector was worrying the authorities: on 27 August all townspeople (other than kolkhoz members) were subject to tax on any livestock they owned; this hit suburban dwellers. On the same day peasants were strictly forbidden to buy bread, potatoes and other foodstuffs in state stores to feed to their livestock.<sup>15</sup> They did this because of lack of other fodder, and also because the price of bread in particular was low in relation to the free-market price of meat.

Price relativities were indeed wrong. So, it became increasingly apparent, was the principle of purchasing products at two different prices. For instance, in 1957 the average quota price for grain was 25 roubles per quintal, the over-quota price 80 roubles. In practice, sales at both prices were compulsory, so it was not a matter of encouraging voluntary additional sales. The result of this was that poorer farms, with little to sell over the basic delivery quota, were in effect paid less per unit than the more successful farms. Over the country as a whole prices per ton in a good harvest year were higher than in time of scarcity, which did not make any kind of economic sense. Therefore the creation of a unified price (with zonal variations) was decided.

This decision was linked with another, which concerned the MTS. For a long time the dual position of the MTS, as hiring agency and a means of party-state control, gave rise to friction. The MTS were given plans, in terms of volume of work ('soft ploughing equivalents'), and they and the kolkhozes were often at odds; the kolkhozes wanted a good harvest with a minimum of payments in kind for the MTS, the latter tried to maximize the operations of the machinery, since they would not only fulfil the plan but obtain more payments in kind and so increase state procurements. There were 'two masters in the field', not infrequently at odds with one another. Khrushchev saw sense in the suggestion, rejected by Stalin in 1952 (see p. 327), that the MTS be abolished and their equipment sold to the kolkhozes (the state farms operated their own machinery from the beginning).

The price reform and the winding up of the MTS were decreed together, following the resolution of the February 1958 central committee plenum. Prices had to be adjusted to the fact that the kolkhozes were now to sell to the state the grain (and some other crops) formerly handed over in payment for MTS services; on the other hand the kolkhozes had to purchase machinery and then maintain it and buy replacements, spare parts, fuel, and to pay the employees of the MTS, who had received state wages in whole or in part, and who were to be given privileged status within the kolkhozes which they were now to join. Repair Technical Stations (RTS) were to undertake major technical tasks, on payment.

The plenum also decided to call a Kolkhoz Congress to revise the kolkhoz statutes, but it did not in fact meet until much later.

The results of this reform were, in retrospect, extremely disappointing. But before examining the reason for this and the other unfavourable developments in agriculture after 1958, it is necessary to look at other branches of the economy.

Industry: Plan Fulfilment and the New (Sixth) Five-Year Plan

1955 was the last year of the fifth five-year plan, which had been adopted with Stalin very much in charge. We have seen that its industrial components were amended by Malenkov, but these amendments were forgotten after his fall. The key indicators of the plan were fulfilled as follows (with the next five-year plan targets given in the last column):

producers' goods, the i960 plan indices for gross industrial production are inconsistent. But that is how they appeared in the plan.

It is unnecessary to repeat yet again the cautionary words with regard to aggregate indices of growth. But it is clear that this was a reasonably successful quinquennium, in quantitative terms. Growth was rapid, particularly in agricultural machinery, which continued (until 1958) to receive priority attention. Total investments exceeded the previous quinquennium by 93 per cent, and the plan by over 3 per cent.

The preparation of the sixth plan was particularly thorough. Attention was drawn to the erroneous practice of confining plandrafting to a small group of senior officials. During 1955 the need was repeatedly stressed to incorporate the latest technical ideas, to study foreign achievements. Thus there was an all-union conference of industrial staffs in Moscow on 16-18 May, a decree on technical progress adopted on 28 May setting up the State Committee on New Technique (Gostekhnika); a central committee plenum of 4-12 July was devoted to this theme, and so on. In the same year the powers of union republics over the economic enterprises within their borders, over the allocation of materials and over a range of investment decisions were increased (decree of 4 May). A decree of 9 August enlarged the powers of directors of enterprises (in practice there was little change). Directors, local officials and even trade-union branches were to be brought into thorough discussion of draft proposals for the next five-year plan. After full consultation Gosplan was to submit to the central committee *(sic)* its draft of the five-year plan by 1 November I955-<sup>16</sup>

Meanwhile, Gosplan was divided, in June 1955, between the State Committee on long-term *(perspektivnomu)* planning, still called Gosplan, and the State Economic Commission for current planning, known as *Gosekonomkomissiya."* No doubt these tasks were distinct as well as vast, but this rearrangement in no way helped to ensure consistency between the long-term and current plans, which is essential if an investment programme is to be implemented. To carry out the growing construction programme more expeditiously there were major developments towards industrial methods and prefabrication in building. Specialized construction ministries were created, supervised by the State Committee on Construction, whose head, Kucherenko, was a deputy premier.

The twentieth party congress duly adopted the sixth five-year plan; the key target figures appear in the above table. Among its most important elements was the decision to create what was called the third metallurgical base, in Kazakhstan and Siberia, which would produce 15-20 million tons of pig iron a year. The delegates also heard Khrushchev's famous 'secret speech' denouncing Stalin. Among his many objectives one was doubtless to break bureaucratic and petty-authoritarian habits of the Stalin era, habits which still affected the administration of the economy. Various decrees were issued at this period seeking to combat bureaucracy and overstaffing of government offices.

However, the sixth plan was the one Soviet long-term plan which was explicitly abandoned in peacetime. Within a year of its adoption it was decided to revise it, and then it never came to life again.

## The Economic-Political Crisis (December 1956-May 1957): Sovnarkhozy

A plenum of the central committee met on 20 December 1956. It emerged, judging from its resolution, that the plan was out of balance, that there was 'excessive tautness', that there were defects in planning. A pamphlet published later<sup>18</sup> blamed the ministries for competing with each other for investment resources, and in effect trying to bite off more than they could chew. The investment programme required by the plan was impossible, in the sense that the material means of carrying it out in time were not present. This suggested lack of adequate coordinating powers. (It is only fair to add that a fairly senior Soviet economist once told me, unofficially, that the sixth plan was quite good, and the objections to it were political.) Anyhow, it was decided that the plan be revised and re-submitted.

To ensure that the ministries would pull together, it was proposed that Gosekonomkomissiya, headed by M. Pervukhin,

should become a kind of super-ministry with powers to issue orders to all the economic ministries (in the first version of the proposals, even to the Ministry of Agriculture). Since this was a moment at which Khrushchev's political standing was weakened by the Hungarian and Polish events, for which his 'de-Stalinization' activities could be blamed, it is more than probable that this proposal, while a reaction to genuine economic-organizational problems, was politically inspired. Khrushchev's powers of interference on economic affairs were to be drastically curtailed by the appointment of another man as overlord. Judging by subsequent events, this was an alliance against him of the old guard (Molotov, Malenkov, Kaganovich) and the professional planners (headed by Saburov, chairman of Gosplan, and Pervukhin).

By appropriate political manoeuvring Khrushchev hit back, successfully prevented these arrangements from materializing, and had already by February 1957 put up for 'discussion' totally different proposals. These, after several amendments, served as a basis for legislation adopted (with its usual unanimity) by the Supreme Soviet in May. The idea was to cope with the problem of ministerial empire-building and insufficient coordination by the drastic expedient of abolishing the industrial ministries altogether, and substituting a regional structure coordinated by Gosplan. Khrushchev was responding to a very real problem, but doing so in a manner calculated to harm his political opponents, and to weaken the state-ministerial hierarchy.

Several reasons were advanced for the need for such a change: there was duplication of supply arrangements and components manufacture between ministries, resulting in unnecessary crosshauls. A steamer belonging to one ministry would proceed up the river Lena full and return empty, while another steamer, transporting goods for a different ministry, went down-river full and up-river empty. Local coordination and regional planning were impeded by the fact that all enterprises of all-union interest had lines of subordination to Moscow, and too many minor decisions required the assent of remote ministries. All these points did have some validity. Ministerial 'empire-building' in particular did lead to waste. This was due not so much to bureaucratic-personal ambitions as to uncertainty over supplies: one made or procured

one's own components and materials in case they were otherwise unobtainable. Every enterprise tended to do this too.

The trouble, as we shall see, was that the cure was worse than the disease. In any case it is in the nature of all-round planning that any organizational solution carries with it certain disadvantages.

There are common problems of an industry, or a region, or matters transcending both a given industry and a given region such as labour, investment policy, finance. Arrangements best suited for considering one of these matters seldom suit others. It is like writing an economic history: a strictly chronological account confuses the reader by fragmenting the discussion of, say, industrial reform or agricultural prices. But an arrangement based on subject may well confuse the chronology, and there is no perfect solution.

Under the reform, civilian industrial and building enterprises of other than purely local significance were placed under regional economic councils *(sovnarkhozy,* resurrecting the name devised in the war-communism period for regional sub-divisions of VSNKH). There were to be 105 of them, of which, initially, seventy would be in the RSFSR (there were minor changes in numbers in 1957-9). Of the other republics, only Kazakhstan (9 regions), the Ukraine (11) and Uzbekistan (4) were divided. The other eleven republics were each co-extensive with a sovnarkhoz." At first the ministries concerned with armaments production, chemicals and electricity were left in being. Each sovnarkhoz was in general command of its enterprises. The sovnarkhozy were to be appointed by and responsible to the republican Councils of Ministers, with the republican Gosplans acting as coordinators in the four multi-sovnarkhoz republics. The all-union Gosplan was to be responsible for general planning, the coordination of plans, the allocation between republics of key commodities, though without executive authority, which resided formally in the all-union Council of Ministers. Gosekonomkomissiya was abolished.

Khrushchev's success in pushing through these proposals was followed in the next month by the effort of the so-called 'antiparty group' to unseat him. This ended the political careers of

#### **354 The Khrushchev Era**

many old leaders. Bulganin, the premier, remained until the following year, though he too had opposed Khrushchev. On 28 March 1958 Khrushchev combined in himself the first secretaryship and the premiership.

## Labour, Wages, Prices, Social Services (1955-8)

Malenkov's fall had been due, *inter alia,* to alleged softness towards the consumer. The immediate response was to withdraw purchasing power by doubling the level of the virtually compulsory bond sales. The effect was, according to a well-informed Soviet analyst, that workers' take-home pay in 1955 was 18 per cent below 1954 levels.<sup>20</sup> But after this the advance was resumed. Average wages rose from 715 roubles a month in 1955 to 778 roubles in 1958.<sup>21</sup> As for compulsory bond sales, these were abandoned altogether from 1958, by decree of 19 April 1957, but simultaneously a moratorium ('for twenty years') was declared in respect of repayment of principal and of interest (in the form, mainly, of lottery winnings) on past bonds of this type. It was explained that the budget could not afford simply to abandon the bond sales while continuing repayments and interest.

It was clearly a matter of concern to the authorities that the retail price level should stay steady. Such increases as occurred (the doubling, for good reason, of potato and vegetable prices, a sharp increase in the price of vodka, etc.) were balanced by cuts, notably in prices of those manufactured goods which were relatively abundant (watches, sewing machines, certain textiles, etc.). The official retail price index showed no appreciable change from 1954 until 1980, but this was plainly due to its failure to reflect disguised price increases (see Appendix). Kolkhoz market prices remained, on average, 35 per cent to 45 per cent above official prices, indicating a tendency to underprice foodstuffs.

The wages structure was in a tangle. There had been no systematic overhaul of wages since long before the war. The prevalence of piece-rates and bonus schemes enabled some enterprises and some ministries to increase pay, while others, especially those on time-rates and fixed salaries, had been less lucky. Different ministries adopted different wage-zones. Pay of persons of similar skills and even identical occupations, in different ministries, varied without reason. Norms were overfulfilled on average by 60 per cent to 70 per cent. The unskilled grades in many industries were virtually unstaffed; the least qualified workers were graded as semi-skilled, so as to pay them something nearer to a living wage. 'Progressive' piece-rates led to many abuses. Reform was essential, but was also exceedingly difficult.<sup>22</sup>

This situation led to the setting up, on 24 May 1955, of the State Committee on Labour and Wages. Its first head was L. Kaganovich. It proved to be his last job before his fall. A systematic rearrangement of the wages structure followed. Differentials were reduced, standard pay scales introduced for occupations regardless of departmental subordination, various anomalies ironed out. The obsession with individual piece-rates which characterized the Stalin period was modified. Extreme incentive schemes - such as payments at treble-rates for output over the norm in the coal industry - were eliminated. AH this took many years. Indeed, the task could be said to have been completed only in 1965, when improved pay rates came into operation for most of the service sectors.

Reduction of differentials was speeded by the introduction of a minimum wage of 300 roubles per month in towns by a decree of 8 September 1956 (270 roubles in rural areas), a minimum subsequently raised. It is some reflection on the number of persons whose basic pay was lower than these exceedingly modest sums that, so we are told, the low-paid worker gained an average of 33 per cent.<sup>23</sup> At a reasonable conversion rate - remembering these are old roubles - 300 roubles equalled *£g,* or \$25 per *month*  (in 1956 prices). Khrushchev also took some steps against very high salaries: I was told that professors' basic pay went down from 6,000 to 5,000 roubles per month, for instance.

This was part of a wave of social legislation. Shorter hours for juveniles without loss of pay; a minimum of a month's holiday for those under 18;<sup>24</sup> the reduction of the working week by two hours, with more cuts to come,<sup>25</sup> a 7-hour day (6 hours on

Saturdays) being introduced by stages; the lengthening of paid maternity-leave to  $112 \text{ days}^{26}$  the repeal of the criminal-law liability for leaving work without permission and for absentee $ism.$ <sup>27</sup> the abolition of tuition fees in secondary and higher  $\text{education}^{28}$  and, most important, great improvements in pension and disability benefits, these being now calculated in relation to actual earnings, with a minimum old-age pension of 300 roubles per month (and an overall maximum of 1,200 roubles).<sup>29</sup> Until this date all but the specially favoured sectors were subject to a maximum reckonable earnings rule which reduced pensions to low and sometimes derisory levels. The effect of this law was to increase the average pension by 81 per cent, but the underprivileged gained much more than this. Finally, income tax exemptions on low incomes were extended.<sup>30</sup>

A big increase in the rate of house construction began in 1956, and private house-building received rather more financial and material support:

Urban Housing (million square metres total space, new construction)

| 1959 | 535  | 27.2     |

(Sources: Nar. khoz., 1963, p. 514; Nar. khoz.,iqs6,p. 176.)

It will be noted that the lower-paid were the principal beneficiaries of most of these reforms, which reversed much of Stalin's reactionary legislation of the 1938-40 period.

Workers were now free to leave their jobs, though subject to some limitations on movement owing to the passport system; thus it was still very hard to obtain permission to live in Moscow and some other big cities. None the less, greater unplanned labour mobility was a fact, and this, plus the abolition of most of the forced-labour camps, complicated the process of planning and made wage relativities of ever greater economic significance.

Trade-union activity was increased; their failure to represent and defend the workers was criticized, especially at the central committee plenum devoted to this subject held in December 1957. The powers of the factory trade-union committees were defined and extended by a new set of rules promulgated on 15 July 1958 by the Supreme Soviet presidium.

Wholesale prices of industry were lowered in July 1955, following some reduction in costs. Thus coal prices were cut by 5 per cent, oil and gas by 10 per cent, iron and steel by 10 per cent, electricity by 13 per cent, rail freight rates by 10.5 per cent, and so on.<sup>31</sup> The process of price fixing was not significantly altered. Though some anomalies were removed, there was still insufficient inducement to produce goods in demand or of high quality, or modern types of machinery. Timber prices were insufficient to cover costs, and they had to be increased several times in the following years. Coal was also produced at an increasing loss.

This was the last systematic price review implemented before 1967.

In 1961, possibly inspired by de Gaulle's 'heavy franc', the Soviet government decided to multiply the internal value of the rouble by ten. No purchasing power was withdrawn from circulation - this was not a repeat of 1947. New notes were exchanged on a 1:10 basis, but all prices and wages were altered proportionately: 1,000 old roubles became 100 new roubles. The opportunity was taken to devalue the external value of the rouble while seeming to increase it: the rate of 4 roubles = \$1 was altered to 0.90 rouble = \$1, i.e. by much less than internal incomes and prices.

The share of turnover tax and profits in the budget remained much as before, with a continued trend to a relative increase of profits as a source of revenue, despite the price reductions referred to above. Direct taxation became even less significant, following cuts in tax on low incomes, and also, in December 1957, in the 'bachelor and small family tax', introduced in wartime (single women and couples without children were now exempt).

The State Bank was separated from the Ministry of Finance (23 April 1954), and was then given wider powers to use credits to encourage financially efficient enterprises and to take measures, almost amounting to a form of 'socialist bankruptcy', to penalize those who incurred debts (decree of 21 August 1954, and others). These powers were little used.

## Foreign Trade: Some Significant Changes

Relations with all categories of countries altered radically soon after Stalin's death.

There began a revision of the basis of exchanges with other communist-ruled states. Trade relations were resumed with Yugoslavia in 1954. Reparations deliveries from East Germany were to cease in 1954 under an agreement negotiated in August 1953; this also provided for the handing over of Soviet-controlled enterprises on East German territory. In September 1953 the USSR agreed to give more technical aid to China, and a similar agreement, in October 1954, also provided for the handing over of mixed Soviet-Chinese companies and granted a long-term credit of 520 million roubles. In March and September 1954 the USSR sold and handed over the Soviet share in nearly all Soviet-Romanian mixed companies. A credit at low interest rates was granted to Bulgaria (February 1956). This process of normalizing and regularizing trade relations received a powerful impetus from the troubles in Poland and Hungary. The Soviet leadership even felt it necessary, in its agreement with Poland in November 1956, to cancel Polish indebtedness on past credits as compensation for 'the full value of the coal supplies to the USSR from Poland in the years 1946-53', a clear and public admission of past underpayments.<sup>32</sup> Hungary had to be given emergency aid.

Trade henceforth was based on prices ruling at various dates in world (i.e. capitalist) markets.

Comecon was revived as a functioning institution. It sprouted a number of working committees, and achieved some results in standardization of design, joint transport arrangements, a very few joint investment projects, pipelines, some specialization

arrangements in the field of machinery. However, trade remained predominantly of a bilateral character, and there was no agreed criterion of specialization.

The USSR began to perceive political and economic opportunities in its dealings with underdeveloped countries. Already on 5 August 1953 a trade agreement with Argentina had included some Soviet supplies on credit. But the USSR seriously entered the aid business after the visit to India in 1955 of Khrushchev and Bulganin. A great increase in the volume of trade occurred, since Soviet aid took the form of supplying goods on credit, to be paid for in the goods normally exported by the recipient country. By 1958 the effect was sufficiently impressive to give rise to oversanguine hopes in the mind of Khrushchev, and to exaggerated alarm in Western circles.

Trade with Western countries also increased, as relations unfroze. The combined effect of all these developments was to cause a sharp upward surge in the volume of Soviet foreign trade, as the following figures demonstrate:

**Volume of Soviet Foreign Trade (1955 = 100) Imports Exports 1950 54.6 56.7 1958 148.4 130.0**  *(Source: Vneshnaya torgovlya SSSR* **(1961), p. 13)** 

## Education, Technical Training, Health

Among the most creditable achievements of the entire Soviet period has been the advance of education at all levels. Despite occasional setbacks, the ideological-political commitment to education, plus the need for more technically qualified staffs always led to yet another upward swing in educational spending. True, schools were too few, pupils attended in two or sometimes even three shifts. But teachers were produced at a most creditable

#### **360 The Khrushchev Era**

rate, and the average number of pupils per teacher has for some time been much lower than in Britain or the United States. The following figures are impressive evidence (it should be noted that the total number of children educated was affected by the very large reduction in the birth-rate that occurred during and just after the war, and then the post-war increase):

| School year                                                                    | 1940-41                           | 1955-6                   | 1958-9                 | 1965-6                    |

Particularly spectacular gains were recorded in the more backward national republics.

, A large expansion of secondary education after the war culminated in the decision of the twentieth party congress (February 1956) to introduce full secondary education for all in towns, and gradually extend it to the country.

This led quickly to difficulties which remind one of the educational troubles of the late thirties. Soviet secondary education is academically orientated, and those who complete the full 10- or 11- year course (ages 7-17 or 18) and pass the examinations expect to enter higher education, and show little desire for ordinary technical training. But then, who is to work at the factory bench? There were declarations on 'polytechnization' of secondary education, i.e. the introduction of elementary work training in the upper forms, but lack of facilities and lack of interest among teachers made it virtually a dead letter. Khrushchev, who was instinctively suspicious of intellectuals and averse to privilege, also sought to widen the social intake into universities.

Stalin, it may be recalled, checked the spread of academic secondary education by introducing fees, and dealt with lack of trainees by compulsory call-up of juveniles. Khrushchev had just abolished fees, and compulsion was no longer politically practicable. So in December 1958, following a memorandum from Khrushchev, a new law was passed. This limited compulsory education to 8 years (7-15), after which the majority of pupils would go on to technical training of various kinds, either full-time or on the job. Higher education was to be part-time for most students, being combined with useful work, and was to be preceded by at least two years' employment.

This reform was not popular among either educationalists or students, and it is a fascinating study in social politics to observe how Khrushchev's intentions were evaded and then virtually nullified. Many thought up special reasons why an exception should be made for their subject (music, mathematics, physics, etc.) or their district, and so on. This was one of Khrushchev's first failures. But one essential element remained: the abandonment of the decision to extend full secondary education to all, the *de facto* acceptance of the principle of selection.

Total numbers of pupils receiving both higher and secondary technical education advanced very rapidly, quadrupling between 1940 and 1964. However, it should be noted that in recent years roughly a third of both categories were correspondence or external students, many of whom never completed their courses.

Health statistics likewise looked very impressive:

|                                   | 1940               | 1958  | 1965  |

| Numbers<br>of<br>hospital<br>beds | (thousands)<br>791 | 1,533 | 2,224 |

*(Source: SSSR v tsifrakh v 1965 godu,* **p. 154.)**  *Note:* **Figures exclude military.** 

Here, however, there was much to criticize in the quality of the service rendered, the availability and cost of drugs, the lack of hospital equipment. This was recognized when the price of drugs was halved as from August 1957, and a decree devoted to the medical industry output sought greatly to increase output of all kinds of items, from thermometers to penicillin.<sup>33</sup> However, thirty years later the same criticisms were made in very sharp terms: under-equipped doctors and hospitals, shortage of medical

drugs, poor pay for medical staff (e.g. see S. Fedorov, *Pravda,* 28 September 1987).

Nearly all teachers and medical practitioners were and are women. There are also many women engineers, technicians, judges. They predominate in retail trade.

During and just after the war the extreme shortage of young men caused the utilization of women in exceedingly heavy and disagreeable work, and while women are habitually engaged in manual labour in most peasant countries, this came increasingly to be regarded as undesirable; in July 1957 a decree forbade the employment of women in the mines, except in supervisory and service tasks. However, as we have been learning under *glasnosf,*  many of the regulations which protected women workers were not enforced or were simply ignored.<sup>34</sup>

Most wives continued to work and this had caused another social problem: small families became increasingly the rule in towns, especially as there was so little housing space. Increased creche facilities did little to counter this trend. The result was an immense gap between the birth-rates in Russia proper (15.8 per 1,000) or the Ukraine (15.3), and the far higher rates in Azerbaidzhan (36.4) or Uzbekistan (34.7), where different traditions prevailed.

#### **Khrushchev Rides High: The Draft Seven-Year Plan**

A revised version of the sixth five-year plan is now known to have been prepared by Gosplan and submitted for approval on 9 April 1957. Approval was not forthcoming. It was decided to prepare a new plan covering the seven-year period 1959-65.<sup>35</sup>

.. One reason given was the discovery of new mineral resources, and the new regional plans which would follow from the sovnarkhoz reform. Further, Khrushchev desired greatly to speed up the growth of the relatively backward chemical industry (this was decided by the plenum of May 1958), and also to transform the fuel balance of the USSR, which was too heavily orientated to coal and neglected oil (which was abundantly and cheaply available in the Volga-Urals fields) and above all natural gas, which

was available in large quantities and very little used. The labour situation, while adversely affected by the consequences of low wartime births, was relieved by reductions in the armed forces.

This duly found its reflection in the new seven-year plan targets. Meanwhile the years 1956, 1957, and 1958 were, from the point of view of long-term plans, orphan years.

The seven-year plan envisaged the following:

557, 609; seven-year plan, 1959-65.)

Apart from a particularly large increase in investment in chemicals and non-solid fuels, the plan envisaged an increased weight of investments in eastern areas, which were to receive over 40 per cent of the total funds. It was a repeated source of criticism that

ministries had found it convenient to direct investments, whenever possible, to already developed regions, to save overheads. It was hoped that sovnarkhozy would see things differently.

Khrushchev, in his optimistic moods, soon found the new plan modest, and in October 1961, at the twenty-second congress, he announced some upward amendments (e.g. steel to 95-97 million tons). This was part of his mood of triumph. Success in making an impact on the imagination of the outside world, and his own self-confidence, was markedly helped by the launching, on 4 October 1957, of the first sputnik. Russia, the backward giant so often looked down upon by the developed West, not so long ago a country of peasant illiterates, had scooped the world. A fine advertisement for the Soviet system.

As the final column in the above table shows (and allowing yet again for exaggeration in indices), industrial progress was impressive during the period of the seven-year plan. There was also a major upward surge in output of many consumer durables. Yet there were some serious shortfalls, and critical deficiencies developed which, as we shall see, helped to topple Khrushchev. The strains of these years have been highly relevant to an understanding of the nature, functioning and problems of the Soviet planning system, as established under Stalin; a survey of the difficulties of Khrushchev's last years of power legitimately forms part of our study.

### Khrushchev's Troubles: A Chronic Crisis of Planning

The sovnarkhoz (regional) structure contained within itself a very serious weakness. To say so is not to be wise after the event. It was no doubt clear to Khrushchev's opponents at the time - and to some outside observers too, including the present writer.<sup>36</sup>

The fundamental problem that faced the planning system under Stalin's successors was this: centralized decision-making could only encompass a portion of the multitude of decisions which, in an economy of the Stalin type, must be taken by the planner-administrators, and which, in the absence of any effective criteria other than plan-orders, logically cannot be taken else-

where. Therefore many plans consisted of aggregated indicators (roubles of total output, or tons, or square metres), and many elements of the plan could be inconsistent with one another. For example, the supply plan frequently failed to match the production plan, the fulfilment of aggregated output targets was inconsistent with meeting user requirements; the labour, or wages, or financial plans were out of line with each other or with output plans, and so on. A large number of semi-anecdotal examples can readily be assembled to illustrate the resultant irrationalities. Steel sheet was made too heavy because the plan was in tons, and acceptance of orders from customers for thin sheet threatened plan fulfilment. Road transport vehicles made useless journeys to fulfil plans in ton-kilometres. Khrushchev himself quoted the examples of heavy chandeliers (plans in tons), and over-large sofas made by the furniture industry (the easiest way of fulfilling plans in roubles).<sup>37</sup> New designs or new methods were avoided, because the resultant temporary disruption of established practices would threaten the fulfilment of quantitative output targets. It would indeed be a miraculous coincidence if the product mix which accorded with the requirements of the user also happened to add up to the aggregate total required by the plan. Of course, ideally, the aggregate total is made up of the separate requirements of all the users. But there is never time or information available for such perfect planning. The planners in fact proceeded on the basis of statistics of past performance.

Yet, with prices not even in theory capable of fulfilling their role as economic 'signals', there was no other criterion than the plan. The central organs either themselves decided these plans, or laid down limits within which subordinate units could operate. Central decisions, though often incomplete and imperfect, were based on an assessment of what was needed. This in turn was based on political directives, past experience embodied in statistical returns, applications (indents) from below, and material balances designed to achieve an elementary input-output consistency. In the almost total absence of market forces this combination of information flows, requests and directives constituted the foundation upon which economic activity rested.

This activity, highly complex in its nature, became more so as

the economy grew, and then in a sense outgrew the centralization upon which it was built. Tasks had to be divided, between ministries administering industries, Gosplan and its numerous subdivisions (dealing with prices, investment policy, labour, supplies of key commodities), the Ministry of Finance, the State Committee on Construction, and so on. A further source of complication was the division of authority between government and party organs, at all levels. As already pointed out, all this led to acute strain in the process of seeking to ensure coordination, and sometimes plans were inconsistent, or impossible to carry out *in to to.* In the key area of investment this took the form of chronic over-spreading of resources on too many projects *(raspylenie sredstv),* causing serious delays in completion. A contributory cause was that capital was provided free out of the state budget, there was no capital charge, and so subordinate authorities overapplied for it and started all they could in the hope of getting more.

Under Stalin the top priority of heavy industry was ruthlessly enforced. Errors and omissions were borne by the less important sectors. Hence persistent neglect of agriculture, and the fact that even the modest housing plans were never fulfilled, despite the notorious degree of overcrowding.

But under his successors this was no longer so. Housing, agriculture, consumers' goods, trade, all became matters of importance, even of priority. So the task of planning became more complicated, because a system based on a few key priorities, resembling in this respect a Western war economy, could not work so effectively if priorities were diluted or multiplied.

Consumer demand, for so long ignored, became more important, as living standards improved and customers could exercise more choice. Some goods became unsaleable, either through poor quality or over-production. Yet the system was not designed to respond to demand, whether from consumers or indeed from enterprises (e.g. for some particular item of equipment, or metal of precisely the desired quality). It was built to respond to orders from above, and for the achievement of large-scale investment projects and expanding the volume of production. The financial and price systems were well able to extract the surpluses needed to sustain high growth-rates, but of what?

The planners tried various expedients. They issued instructions that user demand should be met. They modified the bonus systems so that the achievement of purely quantitative targets should not be sufficient, that the assortment plan had also to be fulfilled, that costs had to be reduced, the wages plan not exceeded, and so on. They experimented with a kind of valueadded indicator known as 'normed value of processing'. Each of these 'success indicators' had its own defect, induced its own distortions. Thus, insistence on cost reduction often stood in the way of the making of a better-quality product. A book could be easily filled with a list of various expedients designed to encourage enterprises to act in the manner the planners wished, and the troubles to which each of them gave rise.<sup>38</sup> The greater the number of indicators, the more likely it was that they would be inconsistent. Similarly, the greater the number of items and subitems planned and allocated by the centre, the greater the burden on the planners and the likelihood of error or delay. But, since the central plan was the basis of all activity, the absence of some item from the plan might have resulted in it not being provided. So efforts to reduce the number of centrally planned indicators tended to be futile. If, say, frying pans or electric irons were not in the plan, then they tended not to be produced, and productive capacity would be switched to make things in which the centre expressed an interest.

Errors in investment planning, shortfalls in technical progress, were to some extent offset, under Stalin, by unplanned movement of labour from the villages. In every plan period, except the second, more workers came to town than was envisaged. By the middle fifties there was much greater consciousness of the need for efficient utilization of resources, including the now scarcer labour resources, to meet the many competing needs. Matters were further complicated by labour's greater freedom of movement

All these , circumstances, and the liberating effect of Stalin's departure, led to a revival of economic thought. No longer barred from practical affairs, economists joined with the more intelligent planners in seeking new criteria - for investment decisions, for resource allocation by planners, and, last but not least, for decision-making at enterprise level. The role of prices, of what came to be called 'commodity-money relations', became a subject of lively discussion. Stalin's dictum that 'the law of value' (affecting exchange relations) does not operate in transactions between state enterprises was rejected.

In the light of this situation the 1957 sovnarkhoz reform was a step in the wrong direction, or at best a step sideways. The essentials of the system were unaltered, in the sense that the plan was the sole effective operational criterion, plan fulfilment the only important source of managerial bonuses. (Profits, it is true, formed the basis of a 'director's fund', renamed 'enterprise fund', but it was of minor importance as an incentive to act.) Yet the abolition of the ministries removed a vital element in the chain of command. Any one of the 105 sovnarkhozy was unable to assess the needs of the other 104, unless these were conveyed to them by the centre. For how could an official in, say, Kharkov or Omsk know the relative importance of requests received from all over the country? In any case, the central allocation of key commodities was preserved, and indeed had to be reinforced to avoid confusion. But one can only allocate what is produced, and so the centre quickly found itself immersed in what amounted to production decisions too, but without the ministerial mechanism. Gosplan, the one body with the necessary information, lacked power and was deluged with work.

Yet enterprises were subordinated to sovnarkhozy, and the latter had only one independent criterion: the needs of their own regions. In the absence of clear orders to the contrary they therefore allocated scarce resources to their own regions. Loud protests reached Moscow that established supply links were being broken. More and more items therefore had to be controlled by or through Gosplan. Similarly, investment funds under the control of sovnarkhozy were diverted to local needs, to the detriment of other regions. Evidently Khrushchev thought that the regional party secretaries would ensure that their sovnarkhozy enforced national priorities. This did not work out. The disease of 'localism' *(mestnichestvo)* was diagnosed, officials blamed, dismissed, threatened with punishment (e.g. by the decree of 4 August 1958). The same complaints were afterwards repeated, since the defect was built into the system.

As the sovnarkhozy gradually lost effective power - in 1962 the Estonian sovnarkhoz controlled only 0.2 per cent of the production of that republic $^{39}$  - the enterprises found themselves virtually without a master, or rather with many masters, since production and supply plans reached them from several production and allocation departments at all-union and republican levels.<sup>40</sup> It was fortunate that informal links of many kinds kept things more or less on an even keel most of the time. But some of these evidently worried the authorities, as they facilitated embezzlement, or just theft. The introduction on 7 May 1961 of the death sentence for a range of economic offences (as distinct from counter-revolutionary or treasonable activities) was a sign of alarm.

## Organization, Reorganization, Disorganization

As the deficiencies of the 1957 reforms became apparent Khrushchev set about making administrative changes. To list and explain them all is impossible in the context of a general history. A bare list of main changes, affecting industry and construction, will be sufficient to demonstrate the confusion created in the process of trying to remedy confusion. They were part of a rather chaotic process of re-centralization.

(1) A long list of state committees was created which by 1962 had very much the same designations as the defunct ministries, but they had no executive authority. Enterprises were not subordinate to them. They considered. They advised, especially on investment and technical policy. They could not order.

(2) Gosplan was again split. At all-union level perspective planning and research were made the responsibility of an Economic science council (Gosekonomsovet) in i960. Then, in November 1962, Khrushchev announced another change: Gosplan would plan, particularly in the longer term, while a new body, the all-union sovnarkhoz, would implement plans. This division was not a happy one, and there was much criticism of parallelism. So, after an obscure struggle, there emerged in February 1963 a super-coordinator of the coordinators which was

given the historically memorable name of VSNKH , but which seems to have achieved little in its short life.

(3) Sovnarkhozy were merged, reduced in number from over 100 to 47 early in 1963. The four Central Asian republics were made into one sovnarkhoz, and a Russian was appointed to head it. Other changes included the creation of large planning regions (seventeen for the whole country), which achieved little in practice.

(4) The party itself was split in 1962, into industrial and agricultural sections, which caused much perplexity. So did the fact that the enlarged sovnarkhozy seldom coincided with the geographical divisions of the party, so on the one hand each half of the divided party was enjoined to supervise the economic activities within its jurisdiction, but on the other it was made organizationally difficult to do this. Khrushchev seems to have feared party officials' collusion in 'localism'. This made no administrative sense.

By 1963 no one knew quite where they were, or who was responsible for what. Pungent criticisms were appearing in the specialized press. Planning was being disrupted.

Khrushchev added to the troubles of the planners by loud accusations of conservatism, and by pressing on them a chemical industry investment programme which threatened the whole balance of the economy, and extended to industry a typical Khrushchevian campaign of a type which had done harm in agriculture. Output was to be trebled in seven years. The targets he forced through were absurd and were promptly abandoned by his successors, though no one denied the desirability of substantially expanding the chemical industry. To make room for them, a new plan for 1964-5 scaled down many other plan targets, from steel to housing. Khrushchev's campaigning zeal threatened serious shortages of steel, of coal, of bricks. It was typical that sensible changes - such as the substitution of non-solid fuels for coal, or prefabricated concrete for bricks - became much too drastic. Thus most brickworks were closed, 8,000 out of a total of 12,000, according to A. Birman *(Novy mir,* No. 1, 1967), causing grave shortages.

Further causes of trouble were the soaring expenses of the

space and missile programme, and the sharp rise in military expenditure - by 30 per cent in 1961, which represented a heavy call on scarce skills and specialist equipment.

Other reasons too contributed to a slowdown in growth, which became quite noticeable especially after 1958. The rate of increase in investment greatly decreased, as the following figures amply demonstrate:

*(per cent)*  **1958 + 16 «959 + 13 i960 + 8 1961 + 4 1962 + 5 1963 + 5** 

In 1963 and 1964, officially claimed industrial growth rates fell below 8 per cent, the lowest peacetime figures except 1933. Owing to poor agricultural performance, the national income in 1963 is said to have risen by only 4.2 per cent. This was when the CIA made news by claiming that the real figure was now down to *2\* per cent, or well below even the United States. The view became widespread that Khrushchev's handling of affairs did not help.

As strains developed, so investment controls became more stringent, and the housing programme, to which much publicity had been devoted, was cut back. Particularly severe cuts were imposed on private building, as the following figures demonstrate:

Urban house-building *(million square metres of total space)* 

|              | State        | Private      |

Khrushchev indeed mounted a campaign against ownership of private cottages, which resulted in some confiscations. He seemed in his later years to have been pursuing a campaign against 'bourgeois' property tendencies. He goaded on the planners and the management by loud-sounding promises about overtaking America within a few years, even by 1970, and promising to achieve some elements of full communism (free municipal housing, free canteen meals, free urban transport) by 1980. This was, no doubt, part of his effort to revive ideological fervour and inject dynamism into a system which, left to itself, was liable to fall victim to inertia. He made other promises too: a 35 hour week, the abolition of income tax, at minimum wage of 60 roubles, all by precise dates, at which they would not be implemented. (The 60-rouble minimum in fact came into force in 1968.)

## Khrushchev's Agricultural Mismanagement

Agricultural output during the seven-year plan should have increased by 70 per cent. This is what in fact happened:

|           | Total | Crops | Livestock |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1958      | 100   | 100   | 100       |
| 1959      | 100.4 | 95    | 108       |
| i960      | 103   | 99.4  | 107       |
| 1961      | 106   | 101   | 112       |
| 1962      | 107   | 101   | 115       |

*(Source: SSSR v tsifrakh v* **/o6y** *godu,* **p. 69.)** 

The 1963 and 1965 grain harvests were badly affected by adverse weather. But the picture as a whole was very disappointing, and was so treated by every Soviet analyst.

The following were the principal reasons for this:

(1) The 1958 reform imposed excessive burdens on kolkhozes, which the procurement prices did not fully cover. They had to pay too much, and too quickly, for machinery. The result was to compel a cutback in investments and decline in payments to peasants.

(2) The abolition of the MTS adversely affected maintenance by dispersing sophisticated equipment around kolkhozes, few of which possessed either the workshops or the skilled manpower to maintain or repair it properly. Many mechanics and tractordrivers had left the villages rather than become kolkhoz peasants. (The Repair Technical Stations provided for in the 1958 reform never got off, or rather on to, the ground.)

(3) Khrushchev pressed campaigns upon the farms, using for this purpose the party machine, which interfered with little or no regard for local conditions, and did great damage. The list of campaigns and distortions is a long one. Maize was to be sown in areas in which the soil and climate were unsuitable, or where the necessary labour and machines were lacking, with miserable harvests as a result. Crop rotations were disrupted. Cattle were unnecessarily slaughtered to achieve spectacular short-term results in meat production, then permission to slaughter was withheld, to rebuild the herds, even if there was no point to it (other than statistical point). The campaign against Stalin's favourite travopolye (grass-rotation) reached such a height in 1961-3 that some farms were ordered to plough up fields of clover, for no better reason than to report to Moscow that the area under grasses had been reduced. Strong pressure from Moscow compelled monoculture (spring wheat) on the formerly virgin lands; permission to reduce sowings to preserve the soil from erosion and weed infestation was refused. Serious harm resulted. Khrushchev personally toured the country repeatedly to advocate these campaigns, and dismissed many local officials and experts who dared to disagree with him, or who failed to carry through impossibly ambitious plans. Procurement quotas tended to be based on unrealistic production targets, and this forced local party officials to act as they did in Stalin's time, taking whatever they could squeeze out, disregarding quota rules, ordering farms about. Even methods of cultivation had their 'waves' of imposed

fashions: two-stage harvesting (cutting first, threshing later), the use of peat compost for seedlings, square-cluster sowing of maize and potatoes, always regardless of the local situation.

(4) As also in industrial planning, Khrushchev confused matters by repeated reorganizations. The 1958 reform had wiped out the MTS, and with it an important controlling mechanism. In the course of 1959-61 he had succeeded in turning the Ministry of Agriculture into a mere technical advisory service. At first he seemed to lay great stress on the role of the State Procurements Committee, as provider of guidance to farms by a contract system, while another state committee handled supplies of equipment and materials to agriculture *(SeFkhoztekhnika).* The rural party organs also interfered constantly. Impatient of defects and inefficiencies, Khrushchev then scrapped this inadequate administrative hotch-potch, decided on tighter controls, and in 1961 set up about a thousand Territorial Production Administrations (TPA), to control both kolkhozes and state farms within their areas. At first these TPA were outside the control of the raion (district) party secretaries, and in each there was to be a party plenipotentiary appointed by the republic. In 1964 he proposed to administer agriculture by all-union departments concerned with particular products. One such was set up: *Ptitseprom SSSR,*  to deal with poultry and eggs. How this would fit in with the TPA, or indeed with the internal administration of the farm, was never explained.

(5) After 1957, output of many kinds of farm machinery actually fell. Apparently it was instinctively felt that the kolkhozes, as non-state institutions, deserved a lower priority, and/or that the MTS had been over-supplied with equipment.

(6) Price relativities established in 1958 were in total conflict with the plan, especially the plan to expand the output of livestock products. Meat and milk prices were far too low, and Soviet economists had no difficulty in demonstrating that these items were produced at a loss. So the bigger the effort in this direction, the poorer the farm would become. This contributed to the reduction in peasant incomes as from 1958, already referred to. In 1962, procurement prices for these items were increased by upwards of 30 per cent, and this was accompanied by a similar

increase in retail prices, which gave rise to loud protests in the towns. Yet even after this increase, and despite the fact that the gap between procurement and retail prices was now too small to cover expenses, necessitating a subsidy, livestock prices were still unattractive; they had to be further increased after Khrushchev's fall. Prices were also insufficiently differentiated between regions.

Finally, Khrushchev committed the grave error of attacking the private plots. We have seen earlier that suburban livestock owners had already been subjected to fiscal burdens in 1956 but the drive began seriously to get under way in 1958 when Khrushchev made his speech to the effect that peasants in his birthplace, Kalinovka, had voluntarily sold their cows to the kolkhoz. He emphasized the word 'voluntarily'; but soon enough thousands of party secretaries were exerting pressure on the peasants to do the same. Then there was the general fodder shortage, with priority enforced for collective and state animals. Pasture rights were limited. Taxes were imposed where numbers of livestock exceeded strict limits (especially on those owned by state-farm peasants). The net effect on labour inputs was negative. One analyst later showed that peasants worked *less* for the kolkhoz, because it took them longer to procure (or scrounge) fodder for their livestock.<sup>41</sup> An eye-witness told me of the following conversation overheard on a farm:

First peasant: 'That's smoke yonder; what's burning?'

Second peasant: 'Hay is burning.'

First peasant: 'Well, let it burn; if it all burns, maybe diey will return us our cows.'

Statistics show that most peasants did retain their livestock, but the number of privately owned cows fell between 1959 and 1964 by 14 per cent while collective and state herds grew rapidly. All these irritations affected work morale, the more so as pay in the collectives declined at the same time.

The great pressure to increase livestock numbers while crop output was stagnant doubtless contributed to a run-down of reserves. The 1963 grain harvest was bad, and it proved necessary to import large amounts of wheat from capitalist countries. This was a heavy blow to prestige, and even though Khrushchev could

blame the weather, his personal standing suffered a severe shock, since he had staked so much on his pet agricultural projects. Total livestock numbers fell very rapidly owing to fodder shortage (pigs from over 70 million to only 41 million). Despite imports there was some difficulty in supplying bread and, especially, flour. Many agricultural areas became short of food. The 1964 harvest proved much better, but it was too late to save Khrushchev. (His successors were so embarrassed that they for a time concealed the 1964 statistics, because they were too favourable.)

The basic problems of agriculture were not, of course, Khrushchev's creation. He interfered, reorganized and campaigned too much, but he had inherited a generation of neglect and impoverishment and a system in which change could come only by order from above, since it treated peasant or even farm-managerial initiative with instinctive suspicion. The word 'spontaneity' *(samotyok)* was never close to Bolshevik hearts, but it was treated as a particularly dirty word in agriculture. Dr Jasny, the outstanding emigre analyst, once said: 'More than any other single thing, Soviet agriculture needs samotyok.' In its absence, plans had to be imposed, and the methods of Soviet officialdom, created by the Stalin epoch, ensured that they be imposed on a set pattern, regardless of local circumstances, so as to report what Moscow wanted to hear. Hence campaigns always degenerated into excesses, even if they had within them some rational purpose - as they usually had.

Under Stalin too there had been campaigns. But in the last analysis he was really only interested in procurements, and interference of party officials was only spasmodic.

It may be asked: but if pay for collective work improved so much in comparison with the Stalin period (despite the downturn of 1958-60), and if prices paid by the state increased so very greatly, how is it that incentives remained inadequate? The answer lies in one seldom-understood fact. Under Stalin procurement of foodstuffs could be regarded as a heavy, burdensome tax in kind. Except in areas of industrial crops, such as cotton, where prices were much better, the peasants to all intents and purposes lived on what was left after the state had taken its share, and on the produce and cash derived from private plots. Their work for

the kolkhoz, in the majority of cases, was just a part-time occupation. Therefore the fact that they could not exist on collective pay was not disastrous: it could be seen as almost unpaid service qualifying them to operate their little private enterprise, on which they lived. But under Khrushchev campaigns to increase output (especially in the almost unmechanized and labour-intensive livestock sector), and to expand procurements led to a big rise in labour inputs on the farms, so for many peasants collective work became their primary occupation. For this purpose neither pay nor conditions were adequate. As late as 1967 there were still recommendations being made that shiftworking for milkmaids be adopted more widely, so as not to have work periods running from 3.45 a.m. to 9.45 p.m., which made all private life impossible.<sup>42</sup> The same point was still being made in 1985!

#### Khrushchev's Fall

Khrushchev was dismissed in October 1964. The economic troubles just described were part-causes of his fell. His overambitious campaigning ('hare-brained schemes'), his exaggerated promises, his arbitrary methods, his disorganizing 'reorganizations', were too much. Yet he did achieve considerable successes. especially in his first five years, and his defects are explicable by his background and experience. He was politically 'educated' under Kaganovich, in the dramatic years of the early thirties. He inherited many perplexing problems, and his methods of tackling them belonged to a different epoch, and were now obsolete. He half understood the need and even the required direction of change, and often spoke of managerial autonomy in industry and agriculture, economic criteria, rational investment policy. He showed that he knew better than anyone how the bureaucratic apparatus of party and state could distort policy and paralyse desired initiative. But in the end he knew only the traditional methods
