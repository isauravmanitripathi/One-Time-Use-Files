## Preparations

By the spring of 1941 the Soviet Union was preparing for war. True, Stalin placed exaggerated hopes on the Nazi-Soviet pact, continued export deliveries to Germany until the eve of the attack, failed to warn Soviet troops of its imminence. But even he well understood that a great trial of strength would come, even if he was tragically wrong as to its date.

Germany's economic power was greater than Russia's and she had at her disposal the industries of occupied Europe. Her armies were well equipped, and the equipment had been tested in the battlefield. Despite the very greatest efforts and sacrifices in the preceding decade, the Soviet Union found itself economically as well as militarily at a disadvantage.

The Soviet Union had vast mineral resources, and even vaster space into which to retreat. However, many of her resources were still undeveloped. Despite the big growth in output in the Urals, Siberia, and northern Kazakhstan, key industries were still situated in the vulnerable west. To cite a Soviet author:

Enterprises making high-quality steels were mainly in the south, in militarily the most vulnerable areas, while few duplicate plants were built in the east. The eastern areas were underdeveloped industrially .. . Ministries and departments, concerned with their own particular interests, emphasized development of industry in the central areas. Thus in the three and a half years of the third five-year plan period investments in the economies of the Urals, Siberia, and the Far East combined were only 23 per cent, in the Central area 19.4 per cent, of the total .. . In 1940 the investments of state and cooperative organizations (excluding

kolkhozes) in the Central area were 2.9 times greater than those of the Urals, 7.7 times those of West Siberia, 7.2 times those of East Siberia.

There was a severe under-development of energy resources in the east.<sup>1</sup>

In a sense these Soviet criticisms do not do justice to the achievements. It is true that there was a tendency on the part of officials in planning offices to set up new enterprises in alreadydeveloped areas of the centre and south, because they were under heavy pressure to achieve results with limited resources, and the easiest way to do this was to save on 'social overhead capital' by utilizing already-existing towns, railways, public utilities. However, the plans did include substantial developments in the east, of which the Uralsâ€”Kuznetsk combine was only the most spectacular. More, no doubt, would have been done had it been possible to foresee the extent of the retreat of the Soviet armies. One could hardly base an economic plan on the assumption that there would be hostile armies on the Volga and in the North Caucasus.

Much more serious was the effect of the purges on the military-industrial complex. First-rate generals, staff officers, designers, managers, were imprisoned or executed. Many of their replacements were second-rate, and decisions on technical matters were too often slow and wrong-headed. It was a tragedy that the key Defence Commissariat was headed by the colourful but incompetent crony of Stalin's, Voroshilov, and even more tragic that his three deputies were ignorant nonentities: Kulik, Mekhlis and Shchadenko. The result was that the adoption of modern weapons was so delayed that good-quality tanks and aircraft, which were a real match for the Germans', were not yet fully in mass production when the war began. This applied to the KV and T-34 tanks, to the Yak-i, MiG 3, LaGG-3 fighters, the Yak-2 'stormovik' fighter-bomber, and the Pe-2 bomber, which were all to show their high military worth as the war proceeded. In June 1941 few soldiers or airmen were as yet trained in the use of this modern equipment. The standard Russian fighter, the I-16, well known in the Spanish civil war, was actually a good deal slower than even the Ju-88 German bomber.<sup>2</sup> The Russian TB-3 bomber was so slow and poorly armed that its crews stood no chance, and much the same was true of the crews of the obsolete Russian tanks. There was a grave shortage of automatic weapons and anti-tank guns. In the circumstances, given the weakness of the leadership (other than Stalin himself) in decision-making, and frequent shortages of necessary materials and components, the defence industry commissariats and actual plant managers performed well before the war began,<sup>3</sup> extraordinarily well when war was raging. But the Soviet army was seriously underequipped for its task, in terms of quality at least, when the Germans struck. There was not sufficient urgency in the last few months of peace, because neither Stalin nor his immediate colleagues believed that action was desperately needed.

The course of the war, and the causes of the initial disasters, are not in themselves our primary concern. But their consequences, as might be expected, had the most profound impact upon the economy.

## Industry and Transport

By the end of November 1941 the Soviets in their retreat had lost vast territories, which contained 63 per cent of all coal production, 68 per cent of pig iron, 58 per cent of steel, 60 per cent of aluminium, 41 per cent of railway lines, 84 per cent of sugar, 38 per cent of grain, 60 per cent of pigs.<sup>4</sup> Other major centres, notably Leningrad, were effectively isolated. This was a staggering blow. Not only was there a shortage of basic materials, but indispensable supplies of components, special steels, equipment, spare parts, were suddenly cut off. The Nikopol' manganese deposits were another serious loss. Big efforts were made to dismantle and remove enterprises and workers eastwards. However, apart from the fact that mineral deposits cannot be moved, the sheer speed of the German advance made evacuation impossible in many cases. None the less, in the period July to November 1941, there were evacuated from the threatened regions no fewer than 1,523 industrial enterprises, of which 1,360 are described as large-scale.<sup>5</sup> Everything possible was done to send eastwards truckloads of fuel, equipment, grain, cattle, amid tremendous

difficulties and inevitable hardship. This entire operation was conducted in the face of daunting obstacles. The task was supervised by the Committee on Evacuation, set up as early as 24 June 1941 by the central committee and the government. The work had to be carried on in the very greatest haste, day and night. Thus 'in only nineteen days, from 19 August to 5 September 1941, there were removed from the *ZaporozhstaP* steelworks 16,000 wagons of vital machinery, including exceptionally valuable sheet-steel rolling-mill equipment .. . The generator of the large turbine of the Zuevo power station .. . was dismantled and loaded in eight hours.' Trainloads of equipment and staff were sometimes mis-routed; there was some inevitable confusion, but on the whole the task was accomplished with remarkably few errors. The equipment was re-erected with speed, despite the greatest difficulties and hardships. Thus the source reports that 'the last train carrying the equipment arrived [in a Volga town] on 26 November 1941, and in two weeks' time, 10 December, the first MiG plane was assembled .. . By the end of December the factory had already produced thirty MiG planes and three IL-2 stormoviks.'<sup>6</sup> The evacuated workers lived in over-crowded premises, and suffered from shortages of every kind.

The equipment was re-erected in any available space, but it often proved necessary to build temporary factories under the most adverse conditions at the beginning of winter. The many stories told of the great evacuation reflect great credit on those concerned. Ten million persons were moved eastwards. Nothing on this scale had ever happened before. Evacuated plants were gradually re-established in the east, especially in the Urals (667 enterprises), West Siberia (244), Central Asia and Kazakhstan (308). Eventually they were able to contribute to the war effort. To supply them, and to replace other sources, it was necessary greatly to expand coal mining in Siberia, the Urals, the Pechora basin in the north, the Moscow basin, and so on.

However, this took time, and meanwhile the Soviet economy suffered terrible blows. By November 1941 over three hundred armament factories were in occupied areas.<sup>7</sup> The Soviet troops abandoned much equipment in their retreat; output fell. In November 1941 industrial production totalled only 517 per cent of the output of November 1940. Only by March 1942 did the production curve show a steady upward trend. Matters were to improve very greatly thereafter.

Some of the losses in production were due, as might be expected, to the indirect consequences of enemy occupation, such as the lack of essential materials and components, but also to disruption of rail transport, acute shortage of fuel, the call-up of some of the skilled labour.

In 1942 the Germans occupied the North Caucasus and the Don area, and emerged on the Volga by Stalingrad. This cost the economy the best of the remaining grain lands and the Maikop oilfield, and for a time the transport of Baku oil was halted. This was a further severe blow.

War industry was reorganized under the authority of the State Committee of Defence, of which Stalin was chairman. This committee acted throughout the war as supreme authority on all matters, replacing (to all intents and purposes) the Council of People's Commissars, and its members or plenipotentiaries were repeatedly sent to key sectors to impose order and establish priorities. The various industrial Commissariats continued to function, executing the orders of the State Committee of Defence. The most vigorous efforts were made to create or adapt productive capacity in the unoccupied regions, particularly in the Urals and West Siberia. The result was as follows, in terms of calendar years (the production figures were at their worst, of course, in the winter of 1941-2):

**(1940 = 100)** 

|                           | 1941 | 194^ | 1943 | 1944 |
|---------------------------|------|------|------|------|
| National income           | 92   | 66   | 74   | 88   |
| Gross industrial output   | 98   | 77   | 90   | 104  |
| of which: Arms industries | 140  | 186  | 224  | 251  |
| Fuel industries           | 94   | 53   | 59   | 75   |
| Gross agricultural output | 62   | 38   | 37   | 54   |

The following table shows how output fell in the first period of the war:

|                                      | 1940  | 1942 |

'The production of rolled non-ferrous metals fell by the end of 1941 almost to zero, and that of ball-bearings, so vital for the production of aircraft, tanks and artillery, diminished 21 times.'<sup>8</sup> One can imagine the gigantic problems which were faced in reconstructing the Soviet economy on to an effective war footing. Yet by re-deployment and improvisation, and the imposition of ruthless priorities, even in 1942 the arms industry managed to produce 25,436 aircraft, 60 per cent more than in 1941, and 24,688 tanks, or 3.7 times more than in 1941.<sup>9</sup> Mobilization for war was extremely thorough. Control over all resources was very strictly centralized, and both materials and labour were directed to serve the war effort, to a degree unknown elsewhere. In 1940, 15 per cent of the national income was devoted to 'military purposes'. In 1942 the figure had risen to 55 per cent,<sup>10</sup> perhaps the highest ever reached anywhere. No doubt the experience of centralized planning in the previous ten years was a great help. In the process of tightening control over resources the government resorted to quarterly and even monthly plans, in far greater detail than in peacetime. The practice of material balances was used successfully to allocate the materials and fuel available between alternative uses in accordance with the decisions of the allpowerful State Committee on Defence. (It is worth noting that so many of its members - Molotov, Malenkov, Beria, Voroshilov became politically discredited in later years that few Soviet histories mention names.) An emergency war plan was adopted in August 1941, covering the rest of that year and 1942. There were annual economic-military plans thereafter, as well as some longer-term plans, including one for the Urals region covering the years 1943-7. Needless to say, wartime planning involved many errors, some of them 'to a considerable extent due to the personality cult of Stalin'. However, as in other warring countries, centralization was essential to mobilize resources, and the USSR, after suffering what could have been crippling losses in the first months of war, carried out centralization very effectively.<sup>11</sup>

Recovery in the second half of 1942 was the result of desperate efforts in the midst of continuing military defeats and retreats. At the end of the year the military tide turned, but little of the great improvement which occurred in 1943 was due to the reoccupation of territory. The Germans were so thorough in their wrecking that in 1943 the gross output of industry in the (Soviet) Ukraine was a mere 1.2 per cent of the total of 1940, though by the second half of that year Soviet troops had occupied Kharkov and by November had also captured Kiev.

A particularly notable achievement was the expansion of production in the Urals area. By 1945 well over half the metallurgical output of the Soviet Union was produced there (as against one fifth in 1940). Steel production in that area rose from 2.7 to 5.1 million tons in this period, coal from 12 to 257 million tons, electricity generation doubled.<sup>12</sup> Altogether 3,500 new industrial enterprises were built during the war, and 7,500 damaged ones restored." There were some remarkable examples of improvisation. Most of the fuel used was wood, which was available locally, as coal, and the means of transporting it, were extremely scarce. Components and spare parts were made locally in any premises and by whatever means were available, since it was impossible to rely on long-distance deliveries. Whole new regional complexes came into existence.

According to the official history, Soviet industry produced the following during the war:

**489,900 guns 136,800 planes 102,500 tanks and self-propelled guns** 

as well as vast quantities of ammunition of all kinds. The history points out that the following were imported from the United States and Great Britain:

**9,600 guns 18,700 planes 10,800 tanks (some of them obsolete)'<sup>4</sup>**

It is true that the USSR produced the bulk of what was used. Furthermore, to the great credit of designers and everyone responsible for manufacturing, the quality of a great deal of Soviet equipment was very good, the tanks being especially effective. True, the Red Army was somewhat backward in signalling equipment, and the air force was under-supplied with bombers. But it is quite beyond dispute that the vast majority of the best aircraft, tanks and guns were of Soviet manufacture. It is therefore not only a matter of (understandable) national pride, but also of fact, that Western aid supplied comparatively few of Russia's armaments.

The West contributed much more to road transport. One of the weaknesses of the pre-war Soviet economy was in the production of vehicles. In 1928 hardly any were produced, and several new factories had to be built in the thirties. However, the needs of mobile warfare could not be met by Soviet productive capacity. A large part of the growth in the number of motor vehicles in the armed forces, from 272,000 at the outbreak of war to 665,000 at the end, came from US lend-lease.<sup>15</sup>

Rail transport, however, remained the key, and performed remarkably well in the face of truly formidable handicaps, not least of which were uncertain fuel supplies and inevitable overloading and under-maintenance. The cutting of direct communications by the Germans placed great additional burdens on the railways. Thus in the winter of 1942-3 it was necessary to transport Baku oil to Central Russia via Kazakhstan and Siberia by rail, since both the Volga water route and the North Caucasus pipe-line were cut. Coal also had to be transported for longer distances, until the Donets mines could be reactivated. Then the

fact that arms and equipment had to be transported from distant industrial centres in the Urals and Siberia was a further source of great strain. Finally, as the Soviet armies advanced they had to restore lines and bridges wrecked by the Germans in their retreat.

Lend-lease and other imports provided a significant number of machine-tools (44,600), locomotives (1,860), non-ferrous metals (517,500 tons), cable and wire (172,100 tons); these deliveries certainly helped to overcome some bottlenecks in industry, transport and communications.<sup>16</sup>

The sternest priorities were imposed, and the slogan 'Everything for the front' was never more meaningful. With even key sectors of heavy industry handicapped by shortage of fuel, skilled labour and materials, it was natural that consumers' goods industries should be extremely hard hit, and the fact that the Germans occupied the principal food-producing areas caused a very sharp fall in the output of agriculture (in 1942 and 1943 it was under 38 per cent of the level 6f 1940), and the output of the food industry fell steeply, as did supplies of agricultural raw materials. It was hard enough to feed and clothe the army. Civilians had an exceedingly tough time. In 1942 textile production fell to a third of the 1940 level, meat and dairy produce to half, sugar to a mere 5 per cent.

## Agriculture

As already shown, losses were exceedingly severe. The principal source of vegetable oil (sunflower seed) was in occupied regions, and the potato crop diminished to a third of pre-war levels. The peasants who formerly grew industrial crops had to switch to food-growing in order to survive, and the cotton crop in Central Asia fell rapidly to 38 per cent of its 1940 level. Grain harvests were adversely affected by loss of the most fertile lands, by shortages of every kind of labour, of haulage power (tractors and horses alike were mobilized), of fertilizer, of fuel, of spares and equipment of every kind. The following statistics require no comment:

| Grain                                             | 1940         | 1941        | 1942            | '943        | 1944        | 194S             |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| Area sown (million hectares)<br>Yield per hectare | 110.5<br>8.6 | 81.8<br>6-9 | 67.4<br>$4 - 4$ | 70.7<br>4.2 | 81.8<br>6.0 | 85.1<br>5-6      |
| Total harvest                                     | 955          | 563         | 30.0            | 30.0        | 48.7        | 46.8             |
| State procurements                                | $36-4$       | 24.4        | 12.4            | 12.4        | $21 - 5$    | $(47-3)$<br>20.0 |

(Source: htoriya, ig4i~s, pp. 67-9. Some figures calculated from index numbers. Several figures exist for 1945.)

Of course, these figures reflect the loss and reoccupation of territory. They exclude the areas under enemy occupation.

In the circumstances the reduced labour force in the villages performed its task very creditably. Since, as will be shown, the black-market or free-market prices of produce were exceedingly high, the temptation to pilfer, or work on one's own account, was very great. There was an increase in 1942 in the compulsory minimum of trudodni to be worked for the collective, from 90 to 100-120 trudodni per annum in most areas (50 trudodni for iuveniles between 12 and 16). However, the average worked was well in excess of this; with every family having sons and husbands in the army, the sense of civic duty had its effect. A decree of 13 April 1942 mobilized non-agricultural labour to help bring in the harvest. Here again, an immense job of reconstruction had to be undertaken in reoccupied areas in and after 1943.

Livestock numbers fell rapidly at first. Particularly severe were the losses in horses and pigs. The situation was as follows:

|        | 1940 | 1942                         | 1943 | 194S |
|--------|------|------------------------------|------|------|
|        |      | (million heads, end of year) |      |      |
| Cows   | 27.8 | 13.9                         | 16.4 | 22.9 |
| Horses | 21.0 | 8.2                          | 7.8  | 10.7 |
| Pigs   | 27.5 | 6.1                          | 5.5  | 10.6 |

(Sources: Istoriya, 1941-5, p. 68; Selskoe khozyaistvo SSSR (i960), p. 263.)

There is a first-rate and well-documented account of the position of the peasantry during the war by the Soviet historian Yu. B. Arutunyan." With men mobilized and few tractors and insufficient horses, the burden and the hardships were borne in the main by women. There were, perhaps inevitably, errors of planning, as when orders were issued to increase sown area even when the means to harvest it were lacking. Excessive procurement quotas were sometimes enforced by harsh measures: '(individuals) who had no grain were compelled to sell their house, their belongings, their livestock', while party and farm officials who failed to meet delivery quotas were dismissed and tried as saboteurs.<sup>18</sup> Pay per trudoden' (work-day unit) fell, in both cash and kind, to extremely low levels:

|                                 | Average distribution per work-day unit USSR |              |              |              |              |              |

*(Source:* Arutunyan, p. 339, citing archival materials.)

The money meant little, as there was hardly anything to buy. 'The peasant received from the kolkhoz less than 200 grams a day of grain and about 100 grams of potatoes' (per mouth to feed). These averages include tractor and combine operators, who received much more than the rank and file: 'in 1945 the tractorists received 2.8 kilograms of grain on average, while kolkhoz members got 0.6 kilograms'.<sup>1</sup> ' No *uravnilovka* (egalitarianism), even in the war years! Private plots were essential for physical survival.

The leadership decided, in November 1941, as an 'emergency measure', to reintroduce political departments (politotdely) in state farms and MTS.<sup>20</sup>

The administration of agriculture in occupied Russia is a major question of its own, and cannot be gone into here. Sufficient to say that many peasants hoped that the German occupation would lead to the abolition of kolkhozes and the return of private peasant cultivation. They were disappointed. Despite the advice of German experts, the occupation authorities preferred to utilize the kolkhoz system to organize compulsory procurements of produce for the Germans. This, and the revulsion of feeling due to the brutalities of the occupying troops, led some peasants who at first met the Germans with indifference, or even welcomed them, to take to the forests and join the partisans. It was only well after the Stalingrad disaster that the Germans decided to bid for support by promising to abolish kolkhozes. It was too late.<sup>21</sup>

## Labour, Wages

The disciplinary measures of 1940 were further reinforced. Workers in industries connected with the war effort were mobilized and then placed under military discipline. So were transport workers. Holidays were suspended. By decree of 26 June 1941 there was monetary compensation for holidays lost, but on 9 April 1942 this payment was cancelled. Overtime was compulsory. No one was allowed to leave his job of his own volition. Anyone not actually 'engaged in social work' was liable to mobilization: 'In 1943 alone labour mobilization provided 7,609,000 persons: 1,320,000 for industry and construction, 3,380,000 for agriculture and 1,295,000 for timber.'<sup>22</sup> Pensioners, juveniles and other normally inactive persons volunteered or were drafted. By a decree of 28 July 1941 pensioners were allowed to retain their entire pension in addition to their wage.

As in other warring countries, large numbers of women took over industrial tasks normally performed by men. Retraining was undertaken on an immense scale, usually on the job. While compulsion was used, and breaches of discipline were severely punished, the achievements of those engaged in the war economy must receive the highest possible praise. They worked under extremely unfavourable material conditions. Food was short, 'housing' may have consisted of a corner of a room or a bunkbed in an overcrowded hostel. Thus the average 'housing' per worker

in the coal industry fell to 1.3 square metres per head, or 13 square feet!<sup>23</sup> Clothing was often unobtainable, and footwear was irreplaceable if it wore out. The army naturally took priority. In 1943, as against 1940, there was available for sale: 14 per cent of the quantity of cloth, 10 per cent of clothing, 16 per cent of knitwear, 7 per cent of footwear.<sup>24</sup> Heating in winter was sometimes adequate, sometimes not. There were long queues, and the rations were sometimes unavailable. The word 'hardship' hardly conveys how people lived in these terrible years. But this, of course, was quite different from the bad years of the early thirties, which were the result of domestic policies. The sacrifices were borne to save Russia from a deadly enemy.

There was a very substantial expansion in small-scale marketgardening on allotments on the outskirts of towns, and factory canteens provided inexpensive meals. This was essential, since, as we shall see, any food in excess of the modest ration was extremely expensive.

Wages were kept in check fairly effectively, and in some sectors of the economy (administration, medical and health services, etc.) there seems to have been very little increase. Wages did rise in industry: 'Monthly average pay of workers in all-union industry rose from 375 roubles in 1940 to 573 roubles in 1944, i.e. by 53 per cent.. . The pay of engineer-technical staffs in allunion industry rose from 768 roubles a month in 1940 to 1,209 roubles in I944.'2S (But there could have been little increase in pay per hour.) Key industries fared best. Statistics of average pay for all categories of workers and employees which have recently been published, which are not strictly comparable with earlier data, give a figure of 434 roubles per month, 5,208 a year for I945-<sup>26</sup>

Productivity was adversely affected by call-up of skilled labour, and all the other troubles of wartime, particularly in such branches as mining and textiles. But productivity in the arms industry rose rapidly as mass production methods were applied to the new types of weapons and to ammunition. For example, a T-34 tank required 8,000 man-hours to produce in 1941, but only 3,700 in 1943-<sup>27</sup>

## Trade, Prices

Ration cards were introduced in Moscow and Leningrad in July 1941. In subsequent months all towns were rationed for food as well as for manufactured goods. Some rural residents (over 25 million in 1944) received a bread ration. Supply of the few manufactured goods to peasants was linked with the fulfilment or over-fulfilment of delivery quotas. The ORS Y (Departments of workers' supply, see p. 255) were very greatly expanded, as were their market-gardening activities. As in the hard days of the early thirties, the significance of catering establishments increased greatly, especially in factories and other institutions.

Rationing was differentiated by categories, with privileges for those engaged in important sectors and on heavy work. Bonuses sometimes took the form of an extra meal in the factory canteen. A significant contribution from America was tinned meat, sales of which in 1945 were forty-six times above the levels of 1940, due partly to increased imports.<sup>28</sup>

The actual rations in December 1943 in Moscow were as follows, according to US official sources quoted by S. Schwarz (in his valuable study to which several references have already been made); all figures are in grams:

Vodka prices were increased five-fold soon after the war began. There were only minor increases in prices of basic foodstuffs, amounting by the end of 1942 to 11.6 per cent. Prices of manufactured goods in state shops (when obtainable) rose by 26.4 per cent. While not negligible, the rise in prices was kept relatively small (vodka apart). None the less, due to the heavy increase of vodka prices, the retail price index for official trade rose in 1942 to 156 per cent of June 1941.<sup>29</sup> 'Commercial' stores, selling rationed goods at very high prices, were opened in 1944. By 1945 the overall official price index was 220 (1940 = 100); by then the'commercial' prices were somewhat lower than in 1944, though many times above the rationed price (examples will be cited in Chapter n).

Since the volume of goods available declined, so did the turnover of state and cooperative trade (including catering), as the following figures show:

1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 *(millions of roubles)*  175.1 152.8 77.8 84.0 1193 160.1 *(Source:* Malafeyev, *Istoriya tsenoobrazovaniya v SSSR* (Moscow, 1964), p. 222.)

Numbers employed declined too, owing to military call-up and enemy occupation; thus in 1942 the numbers were 59 per cent of 1940, rising again to 87 per cent in 1945.<sup>30</sup> It is evident that total incomes grew much more rapidly than the volume of goods available in shops. The extra purchasing power forced up prices in the limited free market.

Prices there show the acute shortages and hardship of the period. The all-union average figures were as follows (and it should be noted that free-market prices in both 1940 and 1941 were perhaps 75-100 per cent above official prices):

Free-market prices

|                    | July 1941 | July 1942 | July 1943 |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Grain and products | 100       | 921       | 2,321     |
| Potatoes           | 100       | 1,121     | 2,640     |
| Vegetables         | ioo       | 711       | 2,138     |
| Meat               | 100       | 769       | 1,278     |
| Dairy produce      | 100       | 1,160     | 1.875     |

*(Source:* Malafeyev, op cit., p. 230.)

But these indices conceal immense regional and seasonal variations, rendered inevitable by the extreme shortage of transport. Even in peacetime the variations were (and are) substantial in the free market. But in wartime they became exceptionally large. The following prices, in roubles, were registered on 15 July 1943:

|                       | Lowest<br>price | Highest<br>price |
|-----------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Rye flour (kilograms) | 45.0            | 300.0            |
| Potatoes (kilograms)  | 14.0            | 300.0 (L)        |
| Beef<br>(kilograms)   | 40.0            | 467.0 (M)        |
| Milk (litre)          | 7.0             | 162.0 (L)        |

(L) = Leningrad, (M) = Moscow. The lowest prices were all in Central Asia. *(Source:* Malafeyev, op. cit., p. 232, citing archives.)

The very highest of the prices quoted for milk and potatoes, in Leningrad, were perhaps exceptional, in that the city was still partially blocked by the enemy (though no longer suffering the appalling conditions of the winter of 1941-2, when over 630,000 civilians starved or froze to death). But in Central Russia the index for all products in 1943 was 2,120 (1941 = 100), while in Kazakhstan, Central Asia and Transcaucasia it was between 1,205 and 1,322. The *average* price in the free market in Central Russia of a kilogram of rye flour in that year could hardly have been lower than 150 roubles, at a time when most citizens earned less than this in a *meek.* This is a measure of the degree of suppressed inflation, of the shortage of goods in general, and of the relatively restricted size of the free market.

Those peasants who were able to sell at these high prices became rich. Many held on to their gains, waiting for the day when there would be something to buy with their roubles. In Chapter 11 it will be shown how they were prevented from utilizing their gains.

As territories were reoccupied and agriculture and transport gradually restored, conditions became somewhat easier. Reflecting this, free-market prices began to fall, after reaching a (seasonally influenced) peak in April 1943, when they were  $1,602$  (1940 = 100) for the country as a whole. In October 1943, after the harvest, they fell to 1,077, which was, however, higher than the figure for October 1942. But in April 1944 prices rose only to 1,488, and there was a rapid fall to 758 in October 1944. In April 1945 the index fell to 737.<sup>31</sup> Evidently life was becoming bearable. The share of the free market in total turnover rose greatly; 46 per cent of the total *value* of all purchases in 1945 were in this market  $^{32}$ 

Malafeyev's calculations led him to the conclusion that real wages in 1945 were roughly 40 per cent of their 1940 level,<sup>33</sup> after allowing for the low ration prices, high state 'commercial' off-ration prices and the free market. It is clear that, given the acute shortages, any such figures are necessarily extremely rough.

Costs of production in industry rose, particularly in labourintensive industries, in which the impact of increased wages was combined with that of greater inefficiency, due to untrained labour, supply breakdowns and other difficulties. This contrasted with the large increase in productivity (and therefore reduced costs) in the armaments industries, which enabled substantial cuts to be made in prices of tanks, guns and aircraft. Prices of basic materials and fuels were unchanged, despite the fact that it was necessary to subsidize them out of the budget. Freight charges were also unaltered and also called for subsidies.

Agricultural procurement prices were unchanged throughout the war.

## Finance

Wartime budgets were as follows:

|             | 1941    | 1942  | 1943<br>(milliards of roubles) | 1944  | 1945  |
|-------------|---------|-------|--------------------------------|-------|-------|
| Revenue     | $177-0$ | 165.0 | 204.4                          | 268.7 | 302.0 |
| Expenditure | 191.4   | 182.8 | 210.0                          | 264.0 | 298.6 |

(Source: Malafeyev, op. cit., p. 234.)

It can be seen that there was a deficit in the first three years, which contributed to inflationary pressure. Revenues were adversely affected by the fall in turnover tax yield, owing to the drastic fall in consumers' goods output. It produced only 66 milliard roubles in 1942, against 104 milliard in 1940.<sup>34</sup> There was little chance to recoup this by price increases, since, with the important exception of vodka, the increases were small, until the introduction of 'commercial' shops in 1944, which contributed to an increase in revenues of 15 milliards. Altogether 70 per cent of all revenues during the war were raised from 'the national economy', in the form of turnover taxes and profits in the main. There were also large increases in personal taxation and in bond sales, and the share of these in the budget was far higher than in neacetime.

Thus a decree of 3 July 1941 added amounts ranging from 50 per cent to 200 per cent to existing income taxes and agricultural tax, with some exceptions for families of serving soldiers. This was replaced on 29 December 1941 by a special war tax; kolkhoz members paid a tax which varied from 150 to 600 roubles a year per member of household, and increased taxes on a sliding scale were imposed on workers and employees. Revised rates were introduced on 30 April 1943. On 21 November 1941, bachelors and childless persons were subjected to a special tax. Local taxes (on buildings, land, carts, livestock, markets) were introduced or consolidated on 10 April 1942. However, many of these local taxes were paid by institutions (e.g. buildings tax by trade enterprises).

The following table shows the pattern of revenue and the growth of taxes and bond sales during the war:

|                        | 1940 | 1942   | 1943<br>(mil'Hards of roubles) | 1944   | 1945   |
|------------------------|------|--------|--------------------------------|--------|--------|
| TOTAL REVENUE          | 180  | 165.0  | 204.4                          | 268.7  | 302.0  |
| of which: Turnover tax | 104  | 66.4   | 71.0                           | 94-9   | 123.1  |
| Profits deductions     | 22   | $15-3$ | 20.1                           | 21.4   | .6.9   |
| Taxes on citizens      | 9    | 21.6   | 28.6                           | $37-0$ | $39-8$ |
| Bond sales             | 11   | $15-3$ | $25-5$                         | 32.6   | 29.0   |

Several issues of war loans were floated. Thus on 13 April 1942 a 10 milliard rouble local issue was quickly over-subscribed: a 12 milliard rouble issue in June 1943 in fact produced 20.3 milliards; in May 1944 bonds worth 28.1 milliards were sold in six days.<sup>35</sup> Presumably there was a mixture here of enthusiasm, persuasion and semi-compulsion. Agricultural taxes were also raised. Peasants were assessed in 1939 on a sliding scale related to estimated incomes based on the possession of a cow or other animals, and for every 1/100 hectare sown to a particular crop. Thus, for instance, a cow was deemed to be 'worth' an income of 3,500 roubles in 1943.<sup>36</sup> We will have occasion to examine this species of tax more closely in Chapter 11. There were lotteries, collections of valuables, mobilization of cash reserves belonging to state enterprises. Also the printing press was used, and the total currency circulation increased by 3-8.<sup>37</sup>

Social services were rapidly restored. Large sums had to be paid out to invalids and orphans, and in 1944, no doubt influenced by the vast losses of manpower, generous allowances (and medals) were introduced for mothers of many children. Those with ten children became known as 'mother heroines'.

#### Losses

After decades of silence, it is now possible to cite fairly reliable estimates of human losses, which vastly exceeded those of World War I. Close to 8 million were killed, over 5 million captured by the enemy, many of whom died in prisoner-of-war camps. Altogether, the evidence points to demographic losses of about 27 million people,<sup>38</sup> that is to say the population at the end of 1945 was 27 million lower (on comparable territory) than it was in June 1941, but this includes civilian losses (a million in the siege of Leningrad alone, and over a million Jews slaughtered by the Germans), and also emigration and the demographic consequences of a very low wartime birth-rate. There was a great disparity between the number of men and women in the agegroup affected by military service, which had profound effects on life and work in the post-war decades.

There are statistics of material damage. Of the 11.6 million horses in occupied territory, 7 million were killed or taken away, as were 20 out of 23 million pigs. 137,000 tractors, 49,000 grain combines and large numbers of cowsheds and other farm buildings were destroyed. Transport was hit by the destruction of 65,000 kilometres of railway track, loss of or damage to 15,800 locomotives, 428,000 goods wagons, 4,280 river boats, and half of all the railway bridges in occupied territory. Almost 50 per cent of all urban living space in this territory, 1.2 million houses, was destroyed, as well as 3.5 million houses in rural areas.<sup>39</sup>

Many towns lay in ruins. Thousands of villages were smashed. People lived in holes in the ground. A great many factories, dams, bridges, which had been put up with so much sacrifice in the first five-year plan period, now had to be rebuilt. A daunting task awaited the survivors, once the victory celebrations were over. Indeed, the work of reconstruction was begun long before, though at first with few resources and fewer men.

The following is an example of wartime reconstruction, and of the means adopted to achieve it.

On the decision of the Leningrad city soviet and the *gorkom* [party] bureau it was stated that the entire able-bodied population of Leningrad, Kolpino, Petrodvorets, Pushkino and Kronstadt was to work on reconstruction, with the following work periods: for workers and employees with an 8-hour working day and those employed by military units: 30 hours a month; for workers and employees with a longer working day, and for students and schoolchildren: 10 hours a month; for citizens not working .. . 60 hours a month. Workers and employees are to work outside their usual working hours.<sup>40</sup>

No doubt many other local authorities took similar measures. Probably a great many citizens volunteered. Certainly this had been so when the survivors of Leningrad's dreadful winter of 1941-2 set about cleaning up their city in the spring. But there was also labour conscription and compulsory unpaid work.

In many cases, a remarkable job was done, and quickly. Priority was given to the reactivation of key industrial plant and mines, and press reports in 1944 are full of references to the restarting of production, especially in the industrial areas of the Ukraine.

On 9 May 1945 fighting with Germany was over, and the Red flag had been flying over the Reichstag in Berlin for a week. It is impossible to overstate the effect of this dearly bought victory on the morale and consciousness of the Russian people. Stalin was now the great war leader, who had led them to victory.

Were his policies therefore proved right by history? Some would argue so. A colleague once said: 'The result of the battle of Stalingrad showed that Stalin's basic line had been correct.' An unsympathetic critic retorted: 'Perhaps, if a different policy had been followed, the Germans would not have got as far as Stalingrad.'

There can be no way of judging between these two views. We know only that, in the end, Stalin's system stood up to the test of battle, though after heavy losses, losses for which many Soviet pities blame Stalin: for his error in June 1941, for slaughtering so many experienced officers on the eve of the war, and for ordering attacks regardless of human cost. The assault on Berlin, when the war was clearly won, is said to have cost 100,000 casualties.<sup>41</sup>
