# **11 Recovery and Reaction**

This chapter deals with the last years of Stalin's life. It is an oddly shapeless period. On the purely practical side, it was of course dominated by reconstruction and rebuilding, with the priorities affected increasingly by the impact of the cold war and the resultant arms race. However, economic policy, organization, ideas, rapidly became frozen into their pre-war mould. Stalin spoke seldom, party congresses were not called, even centrat committee meetings were rare (and virtually unreported) occasions. An oppressive censorship made public discussion of serious matters impossible. Numerous, usually unexplained, reorganizations of the ministerial structure made little difference to the actual functioning of the system. Central control was maintained, so was the policy of imposing disproportionate burdens on the peasants, but the issues involved in such policies were submerged beneath evasive formulae or self-congratulatory cliches. At no time, before or since, were Soviet publications more empty of real matter. This somewhat dreary intellectual scene contrasted with some remarkable achievements in rebuilding and reequipping the economy.

#### The Economy in 1945: The Fourth Five-Year Plan

The Soviet state emerged in triumph from the trials and tribulations of war. The economy, though it had recovered from the low point of 1942, was seriously damaged by the war, and the people were exhausted. The task of reconversion and reconstruction lay ahead.

The western half of European Russia and virtually all the Ukraine and Belorussia were wrecked. 25 million people were homeless, 1,710 towns and 70,000 villages were classed as 'destroyed'.<sup>1</sup> Communications were disrupted. Ploughing had to be undertaken with cows or any other haulage-power that could be found or improvised. Millions of soldiers returned to the task of rebuilding their homes with their own hands. Millions, of course, never came back at all, and great numbers of widows and orphans, especially in villages, had to rebuild their lives as best they could alone. Many peasant soldiers had acquired new skills in the armed forces and went to work in industry. Shortage of men in the villages was a major social and economic problem.

The State Committee of Defence remained in full command as the all-powerful war cabinet, until it was abolished, and the regular governmental organs restored, on 4 September 1945. It issued orders for the rapid reconversion of war factories to civilian production; enterprises and the appropriate People's Commissariats were instructed to submit proposals as to what goods they should be producing. On 19 August 1945, while the Soviet army was completing its advance in Manchuria against the Japanese in that brief campaign, Gosplan was instructed to draft a five-year plan covering the period 1946-50. Its guiding light: to exceed pre-war output by 1950.

Various wartime measures were being relaxed. Thus on 30 June 1945 the granting of vacations was resumed, on 31 December the special war taxes were abandoned.

Reconstruction was hit by the precipitate cessation of lend-lease in August 1945. Not only was there much to repair, but the Soviet (like the British) balance of payments was in acute disarray as a result of the war. The importance of aid in 1945 can be measured by citing the foreign trade figures of that year (see p. 296).

For most of 1945, therefore, American deliveries were still very significant. There was also aid for devastated regions under the auspices of UNRRA, and a senior American aid official, Marshall MacDuffie, has left us a vivid account of conditions in the Ukraine, where he had frequent dealings with the party's first secretary there, N. S. Khrushchev.<sup>2</sup>

(Source: Ekonomischeskaya zhizn SSSR, p. 438.) *Note:* Quite different figures are cited in foreign trade handbook; presumably<br>they exclude lend-lease.

Immediate action was taken to insist on reparations from exenemy countries, whether or not these now had pro-Soviet or even communist-led governments. Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and especially Germany, were made to deliver all kinds of equipment and materials. Such German factories as the Zeiss works in Jena were dismantled and taken away to Russia, and some of the workers too, to train Russians in their highly specialized trades. Rails were taken up and used to rebuild Russian railways. At first these claims for reparations were recognized as applying to all of Germany, and some factories in the Ruhr, and other areas occupied by American and British forces, were dismantled also. However, with the growing tension of the cold war, direct reparations in Germany were largely concentrated, after 1945, in areas under Russian military control. Even in Manchuria, the incoming Chinese found that many factories had been taken away.

There have been controversies about the extent of reparation deliveries to the Soviet Union. Some Western analysts name huge sums, and claim that the success of Soviet reconstruction at this period owes much to this cause. There is no Soviet official total figure, and there seems little point in entering into arguments about just how much they did receive, especially as some of the gains took the form of half-shares in joint companies, the value of which (until the practice of such joint companies was abandoned ten years later) is difficult to compute. Similarly, we can only note, but cannot measure, the gain to the USSR from trade treaties which worked out to the Soviet advantage to an unreasonable extent. But allowing for all this, surely the evidence is

overwhelming that the achievement of reconstruction was due above all to the efforts of the Soviet people, though no one would deny that reparations deliveries helped. (More will be said in the next chapter about trade relations with other countries.)

On 9 February 1946 Stalin made his well-known election speech in Moscow. He extolled the achievements of the Soviet Union during the trials of war, cited many figures on the achievement of the armaments industry. He then looked forward to a long-term perspective in which industrial output would eventually be treble that of pre-war. He spoke of achieving, in the course of about three five-year periods, an annual production of 60 million tons of steel, 500 million tons of coal, 60 million tons of oil.<sup>3</sup> If these could be regarded as targets for the year i960, then his prognostications were on the modest side, but at the time they seemed over-optimistic:

|                      | 1945  | i960<br>(estimated) (actual) | i960   |  |
|----------------------|-------|------------------------------|--------|--|
| Steel (million tons) | 12.25 | 00                           | Ù¥5     |  |
| Coal (million tons)  | 149.3 | 500                          | $S^r3$ |  |
| Oil (million tons)   | 19.4  | 60                           | 148    |  |

The immediate tasks were very largely reconstruction and reconversion. In 1945 the output of industries in the areas at one time occupied by the enemy - and this included most of the developed European territories of the Union - was only 30 per cent of prewar. Stalin laid great stress, as he already had before the war, on the sinews of national power; to quote a Soviet textbook on the period, 'since the possibilities of financing and supplying capital construction at this period were limited, the major part of resources were concentrated on the most important sectors of the national economy - on the restoration and development of heavy industry and rail transport'. 87.9 per cent of industrial investments in 1945-50 were directed to the producers' goods sectors, only 12.1 per cent to the light and food industries.\* Though much was, of course, done to rebuild the wrecked cities, on the whole factories took priority over dwelling-houses, and there was also a

priority scheme in rebuilding, some historic cities and provincial capitals being given first attention. Thus when I was in the Ukraine in 1956 Kiev had been wholly, Poltava almost wholly, rebuilt. But Kremenchug, a sizeable town on the Dnieper, was still mostly a heap of ruins. Doubtless the builders got around to Kremenchug in 1957. These remarks are not in the least intended to decry the efforts made to make life bearable-after so much suffering and destruction.

Yet again it is necessary to draw attention to the inflated nature of the total output indices for national income and gross industrial production. The 'inflation' is particularly great in the period 1946-50 because of the continued use of a completely obsolete set of

price relationships, supposedly still based on 1926-^7 prices, which greatly overweighted the rapidly-growing machinery and engineering sector. There were other reasons. This was the apogee of the Stalin despotism and of statistical suppression (very few of the figures cited in this book for this period were published until well after Stalin's death). One cannot imagine any Soviet statistician daring to challenge index numbers as being too high; by contrast, the physical output figures were actually used in planning and, with one conspicuous exception, have been regarded as reliable by virtually all scholars. The exception, of course, is grain, and a glance at the above table will show how very great was the disparity. (It is very much to the credit of the late Dr N. Jasny that, working alone in America, he not only correctly estimated the extent to which the 1937 crop was exaggerated, but also deduced the fact that the post-war harvest figures were even more exaggerated, though even he understated the extent of the 'inflation'.)

But while one has to take with a pinch of salt certain of the indices, a glance at the reliable output data shows that very rapid progress was made.

The first full peacetime year, 1946, proved a very difficult one. There was a severe drought, which (as will be shown) hindered recovery in a number of respects. The process of reconstruction encountered many problems. Productivity was adversely influenced by a general feeling of relaxation after the stern discipline and privation of wartime. It was affected too by the need to retrain the labour force, which had become accustomed to producing tanks and guns, to produce other goods. Many workers were on the move, back to their old homes, once the wartime conscription of labour was relaxed. Demobilized soldiers - 3 million or so returned to civilian employment in the first year of the plan<sup>5</sup> required time to settle down and learn their new occupations. Some aged persons and others who had been mobilized or volunteered for wartime work left their employment. Conditions of work were often still very hard, and the organizational problems of reconversion taxed the ingenuity of the planners and managers. In the circumstances it is hardly surprising that the industrial output plan for 1946 was not fulfilled. Civilian output rose by 20 per cent (steel by 9 per cent, coal and electricity by 10 per cent,

mineral fertilizer by no less than 50 per cent). However, this did not outweigh the fall in armaments production, so total industrial output fell, according to the official data, by almost 17 per cent compared with  $1945.$ <sup>6</sup>

After 1946 industrial output increased by very high percentages. This was the consequence of successful reconversion, retraining, the bringing into operation of damaged mines and factories and very considerable new investments. Many metallurgical plants and heavy engineering works in particular were modernized in the course of their reconstruction.

The investment plan for 1946-50 was reported to have been surpassed by 22 per cent.<sup>7</sup> Investments were directed above all to the formerly occupied regions, and the tempos of reactivation of damaged mines and plant were most impressive. Thus despite the flooding and wrecking of mines by the Germans, the Donets basin managed by 1950 to exceed its 1940 output, as the following figures show:.

| 1940 | 94.3 million tons |
|------|-------------------|
| '945 | 384 million tons  |
| 1950 | 94.6 million tons |

The Ukraine's metallurgical output also reached, or approached, its 1940 level by 1950. Since the capacity of the Urals and Siberia, expanded in wartime by new construction and the moving of plant from the west, continued to grow, the net result was that the five-year plan was over-fulfilled in these sectors and the 1940 level far surpassed. The great Dnieper dam was rebuilt and began to generate electricity as early as March 1947. In the Ukraine electricity generation in 1950 also exceeded that of 1940. All this required very hard work, under adverse circumstances.

The revival of consumers' goods industries from the exceedingly low levels of 1945 was rapid in all parts of the USSR. By 1948 the wool industry surpassed its 1940 levels; cotton fabrics and sugar achieved this in 1950, and footwear in 1951.<sup>8</sup> None the less, the textiles and footwear plan was not fulfilled, as the table on page 298 shows.

In 1950 planners had every ground for satisfaction. Errors and difficulties there were in plenty, but achievements could be said to be great. The USSR could face the arms race, which in 1950 was again beginning, with a stronger industrial structure than before the war.

#### Changes in Administration and Planning

The end of the war saw the liquidation of some of the people's commissariats which had been responsible for armaments industries (e.g. for tank production), and the creation of new ones for civilian output (for transport equipment, agricultural machinery, construction and road-building machinery, etc.). There was again a great wave, in 1946 especially, of creating new people's commissariats by subdivision. On 15 March 1946 the designation 'ministry' was substituted for 'people's commissariat', but this had no significance beyond restoring a word formerly regarded as bourgeois. For a while subdivision continued. Some major economic ministries were divided geographically: there was one for the coal industry of the western regions of the USSR and another for the coal industry of the eastern regions of the USSR. The ministries for the oil industry and for fisheries were also divided into two on geographical principles. The Ministry of Light Industry, on the other hand, was divided into Light Industry and Textile Industry. There were also created at this time a number of separate ministries for construction, to administer the growing number of specialized and permanent building enterprises. In 1946â7 the number of industrial and construction ministries alone reached thirty-three, against twenty-one in 1939. The number of other economic ministries increased markedly in these years. The Ministry of Agriculture, for instance, was divided; the department of labour reserves was turned into a ministry and so forth.

To some extent, as already indicated, it was a matter of changing labels, of promoting to ministerial status former deputy ministers in charge of glavki, the glavk becoming a ministry. The process of increasing the number of ministries, which had already begun before the war, was associated with the appointment of

party leaders of politbureau status as 'overlords', in charge of a sector within which there was a group of ministries. No longer, as in the days of Ordzhonikidze when he was Commissar of Heavy Industry, was the party leader directly (and colourfully) in charge of operations. Now the ministers were in reality non-political specialist heads of nationalized industries, with a party leader supervising them from the Kremlin. No doubt this change was due in part to the growing complexity and size of the economy, as well as to the fact that the days of trouble-shooting commissars, in industry at least, were largely over. Arbitrary intervention, especially at Stalin's whim, was common enough, but it seemed sensible to leave day-to-day administration to the specialist ministers.

The union republics never had so few powers over their own economies as at this period. Indeed, if oil in the south-east was administered by a separate ministry in Moscow, what function was left to the Azerbaidzhan authorities in Baku?

However, the process of subdivision evidently went too far, and in 1947â8 there were many reunifications of ministries, though sometimes with altered names and responsibilities. Thus on 28 December 1948 the two coal ministries became one, the two oil ministries plus the oil supplies department were united in one Ministry of Oil Industry, and so forth. Many ministers now became deputy-ministers. Changes occurred also in die other direction: thus the Ministry of Metallurgy was divided, in December 1950, into two departments, to deal with ferrous and nonferrous metals.

The fourth plan and its implementation was undertaken under the authority of Voznesensky, whose tenure of office as chief of the planners was linked with membership of the politbureau. But odd and still unexplained developments affected both Gosplan and Voznesensky. In December 1947 Gosplan was renamed: instead of being the State Planning Commission it became a Committee and limited to planning. Its supply functions were transferred to a separate organization, Gossnab (State Supplies Committee), and its responsibilities on technical progress to *Gostekhnika* (State Committee on the introduction of new techniques into the national economy of the USSR).<sup>9</sup> Then on

10 August 1948 the Central Statistical Office was taken out of Gosplan and put under the Council of Ministers. Voznesensky himself was dismissed in March 1949, and later shot. He was replaced by one of his deputies, Saburov. It is possible that there was a dispute involving him over economic policy or prices; we shall see that major price changes announced in 1948 were partially reversed in 1950. But it seems just as likely that the shooting was connected with an intrigue against some Leningradbased party officials, and had nothing to do with economic affairs. And indeed recent evidence about the 'Leningrad affair', in putting the blame for the intrigue on Beria and Malenkov, made the chief victim out to be not Voznesensky but A. A. Kuznetsov, who had been Zhdanov's successor as party secretary in Leningrad. Hundreds of officials with Leningrad connections were shot, and this included Voznesensky.

The situation of enterprises *vis-a-vis* the ever-changing designations of planning offices and ministries did not undergo any significant change in these years.

## Agricultural Policies: Ever-tighter Controls

1946 was a very difficult year for agriculture. Shortage of manpower, tractors, horses, fuel, seeds, transport (and, in areas affected by war, of houses) initially delayed recovery. In 1946 the total area of land sown was only 76 per cent of that of 1940 (75 per cent in 1945). As if all this was not enough, a severe drought hit many areas. According to recently published statistics the grain harvest of 1945 was 47.3 million tons. In 1946 it was only 39.6 million.<sup>10</sup> Many went very short of food; Khrushchev later claimed that Stalin ordered grain to be exported when people were starving." Serious depletion of reserves of food caused delay in abolishing rationing.

During the war, supervision over the operation of kolkhozes had been somewhat relaxed. Members were allowed in some cases to sow crops on collective land, and kolkhoz autonomy increased: party and government officials were otherwise engaged, and it was obvious that kolkhozes had to be allowed to judge for themselves what was possible amid universal shortage of everything. The governmental and party agencies therefore confined their efforts to procurements, and winked at breaches of rules in other respects. It was in fact widely rumoured that peasantsoldiers were told that the kolkhoz system would be relaxed or even abolished as a reward for victory.

Alas, Stalin took an early opportunity to reassert control. On 19 September 1946 there was adopted the decree 'On measures to liquidate breaches of the [kolkhoz] statute'. All lands acquired by private persons or institutions had to be returned to the kolkhoz. Violations of internal democracy within a kolkhoz were not to be tolerated (they were, of course!). Further decrees reasserted the primary duty of compulsory deliveries to the state, and the power of the procurement organs. To enforce central control over agriculture there then took place a truly extraordinary administrative mish-mash. Following the decree of 1946, a Council of Kolkhoz Affairs was set up to prevent breaches of the kolkhoz statute, and to exercise general supervision over kolkhozes and MTS. Andreyev, a member of the politbureau, was its chairman, and at this period he was agricultural 'overlord' for the party. Earlier in 1946 the Ministry of Agriculture had been divided into three parts: for Food Crops *(zemledeliye),* Industrial Crops and Livestock. It may be said that this was a mere extension into the Ministry of Agriculture of the disease of sub-division, rampant at the time and already noted in industry. But there is a clear difference: in industry any enterprise was subject to only one ministry at any one time, whereas virtually all kolkhozes had some livestock, some industrial crop (sugar-beet, cotton, flax, sunflower, etc.), and a food crop, and so were under different ministries in respect of each, as well as obeying the Council for Kolkhoz Affairs, not to speak of the procurement agencies and the local party committee. This bureaucratic tangle was ended in February 1947 with the re-creation of a single Ministry of Agriculture 'in order to eliminate organizational imperfections and parallelism'.<sup>12</sup> The Council for Kolkhoz Affairs withered away.

However, central interference was not reduced, but rather strengthened. The February 1947 plenum of the central committee decided that the much-needed expansion of agricultural output was to be very carefully regulated, and every kolkhoz was to have sowing plans laid down not only for categories of crops, such as grain, but even for each kind of grain. The same plenum reasserted the duty of enforcing the kolkhoz statute and the absolute priority of state procurements. Procurement quotas could now be varied within each region in the light of circumstances, a provision which in effect legalized local arbitrariness in making delivery demands on kolkhozes. The supervisory role of the MTS was to be strengthened by the appointing of a 'deputy director, political' to each MTS.

At this period the travopolye (grass rotation) system was thought to be a panacea, and farms were instructed to employ crop rotation schemes incorporating grasses, regardless of local conditions, resuming the policies interrupted by the war. Stalin was convinced by some adviser in 1946-7 that spring wheat was superior to winter wheat, and Khrushchev later on told how he resisted by various expedients orders to expand spring wheat sowings in the Ukraine, where winter-sown wheat gives a much higher yield. Then in 1948 Lysenko triumphed over all critics, with the help of the party machine, and his ideas were pressed upon the farms, while real geneticists were dismissed. (Lysenko was one of a species of pseudoscientific charlatan, whose ideas had for many years a great appeal to party officials, seeking a cheap way out of agricultural difficulties.)

The financial condition of kolkhozes was deplorable; the amount available to pay members was exceedingly low. Yet not only did the government not increase agricultural procurement prices, but it put additional burdens on the kolkhozes: instead of being able to obtain seeds from the Ministry of Procurements, they had to maintain their own seed reserves (decree of 28 July 1947, repeated on 29 June 1950), taxes on kolkhozes were increased (11 August 1948), and they had to set aside a greater amount for capital investment (16 February 1952). Since taxes on private plots were also increased (see below), it is as if Stalin was determined to make the peasants pay for the necessary post-war reconstruction. A useful concession\* beneficial to kolkhoz finance, was that retail cooperatives were allowed to sell at or near freemarket prices and to set up stalls in towns for the purpose.<sup>13</sup>

They bought produce from kolkhozes at higher prices. However, this was stopped in 1948 and resumed under Khrushchev.

The burdens on kolkhozes were increased in October 1948 by the adoption of a great 'Stalin plan for the transformation of nature', which laid upon the farms in the steppe areas the duty of planting vast forest shelter-belts - at their own expense, of course, as well as providing for canals and irrigation. It later became clear that the efforts were wasted; the trees refused to obey Stalin and did not grow; very few canals were built. Then in April 1949 there was adopted a decree on a three-year plan for livestock, demanding a great expansion of livestock holdings and a 50 per cent increase in the output of milk, dairy produce, eggs, etc. Procurement quotas were correspondingly raised. Yet prices remained so low that this further impoverished the kolkhozes and their peasants. The plan was, of course, not fulfilled-, but procurements were considerably increased.

Top priority was given to industry, and the villages were left without building materials or electric power. It must have been a source of wry (but secret) humour to observe the innumerable portraits in oils of Stalin gazing upon electric tractors (in fact there *were* no electric tractors) at a time when it was forbidden for kolkhozes to obtain electricity from the state's power stations.

The one bright spot was the rapid recovery of tractor and combine production, which enabled the MTS to do their work better.

Instead of offering higher prices the authorities offered medals. There was a stream of orders concerning the award of honorific titles to heroes of labour in the villages.

On 21 May 1947 the decision was taken to collectivize agriculture in the Baltic states,<sup>14</sup> and similar measures were taken in other 'new' territories. This took three years. Material recently published in the Baltic republics provides much evidence of deportation of recalcitrant peasants and many other unpleasant forms of coercion.

#### **Agricultural Prices and Peasant Incomes**

We have noted the unfavourable terms of trade imposed on the villages by the practice of compulsory procurements at low prices. If, as seems to be the case, there was no increase at all in procurement prices between 1940 and 1947, then at that date the disparity between retail and procurement prices reached its highest point. The retail price index, as we shall see, reached 2,045 (1928 = 100) in 1947. In 1952 the averages for grain, beef, and pigs were actually lower than in 1940." The price paid for compulsorily-delivered potatoes was less than the cost of transporting them to the collecting point, and this cost had to be borne by the kolkhozes, who thus in effect got less than nothing! It is true that retail prices fell after 1947, and in the early fifties prices of industrial crops were increased. But against this must be set not only the extra burdens mentioned (pp. 305-6) but also the substantial rise in the prices of fuel and building materials.

To give some idea of the effect of these prices on net revenues of kolkhozes we can cite costs in state farms. The average procurement price for grain in 1940 was 8.63 roubles per quintal, state-farm costs were 29.70 roubles. In 1952 the procurement price paid to kolkhozes was 8.25 roubles, and state-farm costs were 62 roubles! Yet state farms were able to obtain their inputs at state wholesale prices, while kolkhozes had to pay the much higher retail prices. Consequently real costs in kolkhozes were higher, or rather would have been higher had state-farm wages been paid to the peasant members.

The latter bore the brunt of the loss. In 1952, a better year than 1950, their incomes from collective work were as follows:

|         |     |           | Cash paid to<br>peasants |    |          | Roubles per annum per |  |
|---------|-----|-----------|--------------------------|----|----------|-----------------------|--|
| Roubles | per | trudoden' | (millions                | of | roubles) | household (cash)      |  |
| 1.40    |     |           | 12.4                     |    |          | 623                   |  |

*(Source:* **N. Khrushchev,** *Pravda,* **25 January 1958.)** 

At this period payments in kind were of much greater importance than cash payments, but even so these are exceedingly low figures, in real terms somewhat below a good pre-war year. It should be noted that gross incomes of kolkhozes increased greatly, from 16.8 milliard roubles in 1937 to 42.8 milliards in 1952, but whereas in 1937 almost half of this was paid out to the peasants, the proportion in 1952 was under 29 per cent, reflecting the much higher prices of inputs, higher investment expenditure, taxes, etc.

In 1948-50 cash incomes must have been much lower, perhaps one rouble per trudoden' (these, it must be emphasized, are *old*  roubles, ten present-day kopeks). At that time, therefore, the *average* cash income from collective work was such that twentyeight trudodni (say twenty days' work) was needed to buy a bottle of vodka; a kilogram of butter equalled sixty trudodni, a poor-quality suit required well over a year's average collective 'wage'."

The system of assessing trudodni was altered, by increasing work norms and devising complex bonus systems for overfulfilment of plans. However, this in no way affected the key problem, that of providing a sufficient amount with which to pay the peasants. Lack of effective incentive, due to underpayment, contributed significantly to the difficulties of agriculture in these years.

The peasants were able to survive because of their private plots and animals. But in the absence of sufficient incentives for collective work these were seen as undesirable distractions. The heavy taxes levied during the war on private cultivation and animals were retained. It will be recalled that the taxes were based on a nominal 'rateable valuation'. In 1943, for instance, a cow was deemed to bring in an income of 3,500 roubles per annum, and at this date the tax ranged from 8 per cent to 30 per cent. The valuations were somewhat reduced after the war. Thus a cow became supposedly worth only 2,540 roubles, a pig 800 roubles of income (against 1,500 in 1943), potatoes 180 roubles per hundredth of a hectare (against 350); orchards stayed at 160 roubles. But free-market prices fell to a much greater extent than this, and the tax rate charged on this nominal valuation was several times increased, eventually reaching 12 per cent to 48 per cent. Whereas in 1943 the tax on an income assessment of 5,000 roubles was 540 roubles, by 1951 it had risen to 820 roubles." The high taxes led to peasants reducing their cultivation and livestock. When Khrushchev remonstrated with Stalin, and said that peasants were chopping down fruit trees to avoid the very

heavy tax on them, Stalin replied (or so Khrushchev said in later years) that Khrushchev was guilty of a 'populist' *(narodnik)*  deviation in his attitude to peasants.<sup>18</sup> The growth of livestock numbers slowed down, and numbers of cows remained static, or fell, after 1949, partly because of lack of fodder for collective livestock, but especially owing to the fall in private livestock ownership due to taxes and also to centrally imposed limitation on pasture facilities. Numbers of private livestock in 1952 were far below pre-war levels, as the following table shows:

|  |                      |  | Livestock owned by kolkhoz peasants |
|--|----------------------|--|-------------------------------------|

| (cows)          | (66) | (55) |
| Sheep and goats | 164  | 88   |
| Pigs            | 45   | 27   |

*(Source: Kommunist,* **No. 1, 1954.)** 

Between January 1950 and January 1952 the number of cattle in private ownership fell from 29.0 to 23.2 million (including those owned by persons other than kolkhoz peasants).

But peasants who sold their cows or pigs, or eliminated potato plantings, faced other severe troubles. For their duty to make compulsory deliveries to the state on account of their private holdings was not dependent on the possession of livestock or the cultivation of the crop in question, and these obligations were particularly onerous in these years. Thus every household had to deliver, on average, 210-250 litres of milk a year" (also meat, vegetables, eggs, wool, etc.). They had to beg, borrow, or buy this milk if they had no cow. Only just over half of kolkhoz households had cows.

Kolkhoz market sales were still at a high level, despite the fall in prices in the period 1945-50, as the following figures show (the 1946-9 figures do not seem to be available):

Since *total* cash income for collective work even in 1952 was only 12! milliard roubles it is obvious that at this date the subsidiary private economies of the peasants supplied the larger part of their incomes.

However, it must never be forgotten that there were great regional variations. Some kolkhozes benefited from higher prices for industrial crops: for instance in the cotton-growing farms in Central Asia. Others happened to be located within easy reach of a big city and made most of their money (as did peasants too) out of sales in the free market. But kolkhozes located far from cities and compelled to specialize in food crops and livestock were in a state approaching beggary. Many peasants fled. The population of such rural areas declined rapidly. To cite Khrushchev again: 'One would go through a village and look around, and have the impression that Mamai and his [Tartar] hordes had passed that way. Not only was there no new construction, but old structures were not repaired.'<sup>20</sup>

#### Some Production Data

It is hardly surprising that, after recovering from war damage, Soviet agriculture remained in a very weak state until a drastic change of policy occurred after Stalin's death. There is no escaping the conclusion that he delayed long-necessary changes of policy by his obstinately hostile attitude to the peasantry.

In October 1952, a year of fairly good weather, Malenkov (Stalin was sitting alongside him) announced that the grain problem had been solved, with a harvest of over 8 milliard *poods,*  **i.e. 130 million tons. Reality was very different. Here are the relevant** statistics **(omitting the bad years 1945-6, already referred to):** 

|                        | 1940           | 1947 | 1948 | 1949           | 1950 | 1951 | 1952 |  |

The much better performance of cotton is, of course, directly to be linked with the higher prices and greater incentives.

#### **Internal Reorganizations**

In February 1950 it was declared that the *zveno* ('link') system of organizing farm labour was being over-used, and that the 'brigade' should be the foundation of work in the fields. This seems to have been part of a move to push Andreyev, an old Stalinist stalwart, out of his position as the senior party official in charge of agriculture. The point of the controversy was apparently as follows ('apparently' because this was not a period in which real argument was heard or debates were possible). The zveno was a small group of peasants, probably between six and ten persons, who were given a particular area of land to cultivate or a particular job to do. Andreyev favoured this because it was a way of avoiding 'lack of personal responsibility' *(obezlicbka)* and facilitated payment by results. A brigade was much larger, often up to 100 strong, under a 'brigadier'. The trouble seems to have been due to excessive subdivision of tasks and land, which may have impeded the operation of large-scale mechanization, in grain

fanning especially, and also to the fact that very small groups could be members of one family and so acquire a proprietary feeling to the bit of land allocated to them. Brigades were henceforth to be the basis of operations and of payment by results too, though the zveno as a unit within the brigade continued to exist. Andreyev apologized for his errors.

Shortly afterwards there was another and much larger shake-up. It was decided that the kolkhozes were too small. In January 1950 there were over 250,000 of them. Khrushchev, who had recently moved to Moscow from the Ukraine, appears to have begun a campaign of amalgamations. By the end of the year the number of kolkhozes was halved. The process continued in subsequent years.

Why amalgamate? Two reasons seem to have been predominant. One was the undoubted fact that in the northern half of Russia the average size of kolkhozes was small, much too small to permit the introduction of the then fashionable travopolye crop rotation scheme. The second was lack of control. It was not so difficult to find reliable kolkhoz chairmen if there were to be fewer of them, local party secretaries had their task simplified, the MTS had fewer kolkhoz administrations to deal with, a much higher proportion of kolkhozes could have party groups. A decision on amalgamations, taken by the central committee on 30 May 1950, emphasized, as is customary in such cases, that the process must be 'voluntary'. As usual, it was not. Indeed, on 31 July 1950 the central committee had to demand measures against the slaughter of livestock which accompanied 'the work of enlarging small kolkhozes'.<sup>21</sup>

These amalgamations were undoubtedly linked in Khrushchev's mind with the concept of 'agro-towns', or new large urban settlements to which peasants would move from their oldfashioned villages and hamlets. After some preparatory publicity for the idea Khrushchev wrote an article in *Pravda* praising agrotowns. The next day the article was disowned by the device of an editorial note to the effect that it was for discussion only.<sup>22</sup> Shortly afterwards minor officials criticized the proposals for their 'consumer-orientated' approach, at a time when more production was needed. Later the 'agro-town' was attacked by Malenkov,

speaking to the nineteenth party congress in October 1952. There were some grounds for his criticisms. Conditions in 1950-52 were not such that one could contemplate uprooting the peasantry and building thousands of modern urban-type settlements for them to live in. The proposal reminds one of measures to resettle peasants taken by Ceausescu in Romania (and also of the moving-out of peasants from small hamlets in the USSR under Brezhnev). In practice nothing happened, and peasants went on living in their somewhat primitive villages. But the effect of amalgamations was to make kolkhoz management more remote, both figuratively and physically, and to complicate transport and organization on the larger farms.

Thus the agricultural situation in Stalin's last years was exacerbated by ill-judged interventions of authority, excessive centralization of decisions, extremely low prices, insufficient investment and lack of adequate incentives. High taxation, levied on private cultivation, did further damage. These conclusions are now accepted by every Soviet scholar. A fog of inflated statistics and misinformation (or censorship) hid the true state of affairs at the time from all but the acutest observers

### Prices and Wages

There is a remarkable parallel between the course of prices in 1932-6 and in 1945-9.  $I^{*1}$  both cases incomes exceeded plan, costs rose, wholesale prices of basic industrial products were held down and large subsidies paid. Meanwhile rationing of consumers' goods was accompanied by the emergence of very high 'commercial' prices, and the abolition of rationing was preceded by large increases in the ration price, culminating in the fixing of unified prices, somewhat below the high 'commercial' levels. A year or two later an industrial price reform sought to eliminate subsidies by means of a very large increase in prices of basic industrial materials and fuels. Precisely this happened in the first post-war years, as in the aftermath of the great leap forward.

To deal first with industrial wholesale prices. Costs rose rapidly, and subsidies became intolerably high, since many prices

#### 314 Recovery and Reaction

(for instance, for coal, timber, metals) were half or even below half of the cost of production. The following figures speak for themselves.

| 1946                                            | 25.8   |  |  |  |

| 1949                                            | 2.9    |  |  |  |

(Source: Malafeyev, htoriya tsenoobrazovaniya v SSSR (Moscow, 1964), pp. 246,252.)

From 1 January 1949 industrial wholesale prices were increased by an average of 60 per cent, but timber, coal, iron and steel prices had to be raised by 3 to 4 times. Freight charges were also raised. One effect, as we shall note when we discuss finance, was to increase profits as a source of revenue and diminish the share of turnover tax, which was also being cut back as a result of reductions in retail prices. Turnover tax on producers' goods was abolished, except on oil and electricity.

In 1950 two price reductions were decreed, and average industrial prices fell by 20.3 per cent.<sup>23</sup> Further cuts in 1952 brought wholesale prices 30 per cent below 1949 levels. These cuts could have been a reaction to the arrest of Voznesensky, who had been responsible for the increases. Malafeyev argued that the 1949 increases were 'clearly excessive', and another Soviet analyst, Kondrashev, attached some weight to the efforts of ministries to get higher prices accepted, to 'guarantee for themselves unplanned accumulations'.24 None the less, some of the reductions were plainly unsound. Thus a 25 per cent cut in the price of sawn timber in 1950, when even in 1949 the timber industry still required a subsidy, can hardly be described as reasonable.

The picture is very different indeed regarding retail prices. We have seen that in 1944 the dual price system was introduced. As in 1932-4, there was a low 'ration' (or 'normal') price, and a very much higher 'commercial' price, which was close to the freemarket price. No Soviet source has been found which cites the commercial prices at this period, and Malafeyev, on whom we drew copiously for evidence on the prices of the early thirties, devotes exactly one line to the fact that commercial prices were introduced in 1944, and does not quote a single instance. It is therefore necessary to refer to evidence collected by the US Embassy in Moscow, and published in the *Monthly Labor Review*  in July 1947. In July 1944, according to this source, the ration price of beef was 14 roubles per kilo, the commercial price 320 roubles (three weeks' wages for an average worker!). The very scarce sugar was 5.50 roubles on the ration, 750 roubles in commercial stores.

The system continued through 1945, though the commercial prices were reduced. In 1946 it was intended to eliminate multiple pricing and to abolish rationing. However, this proved impossible because of the extremely poor harvest of that year and it was announced on 28 August 1946 that de-rationing would be postponed for a year. It was announced in September 1946 that as a first stage ration prices would be substantially increased, and commercial prices cut. This diminished, but did not come near abolishing, the difference between them. According to the above source, ration prices rose as follows:

|           | Ration prices<br>up to September<br>1946 | New ration<br>prices |  |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|--|
|           | (roubles per kilogram)                   |                      |  |
| Rye bread | 1.00                                     | 3.40                 |  |
| Beef      | 14.00                                    | 30.00                |  |
| Sugar     | 5.50                                     | 15.00                |  |
| Butter    | 28.00                                    | 66.00                |  |
| Milk      | 2.50                                     | 8.00                 |  |

Commercial prices were much lower compared with 1945: thus beef cost 90 roubles (against 140), sugar 70 (150), still well above the ration price but no longer astronomically so. There was a similar pattern for manufactured consumers' goods.

In compensation for the very large increase in the prices of rationed commodities, on which the lower-paid workers had almost totally to rely, there was the so-called 'bread supplement' wage increase. The maximum increase, no roubles a month, went to the lower-paid. The middle-grade workers gained 90 roubles. Those earning over 900 roubles per month received nothing extra. Perhaps it was surmised that the better-paid groups benefited from the fall in 'commercial' prices, which they alone could afford. Retail prices at this period, reflecting the acute shortages (of everything), were exceedingly hard on the lower-paid. Even including the increase, many of the less-skilled workers were earning under 300 roubles a month (as is evident from the number of those who benefited from minimum-wage legislation ten years later when the minimum was fixed at 300). For them life was harsh indeed.

High commercial prices survived, because there was an excess amount of money in circulation, much of it a product of wartime inflation, and the government decided that the abolition of rationing had to coincide with a currency reform. A currency reform was duly decreed on 14 December 1947. All cash in the possession of individuals was exchanged in the ratio of 1:10, so that cash hoards lost the bulk of their value, and many a peasant found his wartime savings wiped out. However, all holdings in savings banks below 3,000 roubles were exchanged at face value, 1:1, with lower ratios for larger sums. (The peasants seldom used savings banks.) All state bonds were converted at the ratio of 1:3, i.e. became worth a third of their value (and were converted into bonds carrying a lower rate of interest, 2 per cent). This reform must not be confused with the 'new rouble' (or 'new franc') reforms of subsequent years, which increased the *value* of the rouble ten-fold (or the franc 100-fold). Incomes remained unchanged: a salary of 1,000 roubles in November 1947 was still 1,000 roubles in January 1948. So the operation eliminated the bulk of cash holdings, and greatly reduced bond debts. Simultaneously rationing was ended. The state had accumulated enough material reserves to abolish 'commercial' prices and in some cases to fix the general level of unified retail prices a little below the greatly increased ration prices. Rye bread, so vital to the poorer strata, was reduced to 3.00 roubles per kilo, from 3.40 roubles. The net effect was an overall reduction of 17 per cent in state retail prices.<sup>25</sup> The new prices were realistic, on the whole, as is shown by the fact that free-market prices in 1948 were at or sometimes even below those ruling for foodstuffs in state shops.

Thus the Soviet leadership had the courage (or the nerve) to impose prices which fully reflected the great all-round shortages which characterized the first post-war years. The net effect on real incomes may be calculated by reference to Malafeyev: his price index for 1947 was 321 (1940 = ioo).<sup>26</sup> The 1946 average is now known to have been 475 roubles per month. Allowing for the increase in the third quarter of 1946 this suggests a 1947 average of perhaps 550 per month, or 6,600 per annum. This gives a wage index of about 165, and a real wage index for the year of only 51. (It is true that prices of services increased by less than those of goods, but, if account is taken of the many shortages which are not reflected in price indices, conditions were fully as bad as is indicated by the index.) But from December 1947 conditions improved.

The practice of virtually compulsory bond subscriptions continued in these years, representing a further burden of three to four weeks' wages, when it was very hard to make ends meet.

However, as the flow of consumers' goods increased faster than the rise in wages, the Soviet authorities were able to reduce prices in subsequent years. Prices were cut every spring from 1948 to 1954. By March 1950 the average reduction in retail prices was 40 per cent, compared with the last quarter of 1947. The price of rye bread, which had been 3.00 roubles in December 1947, was reduced to 1.40 roubles by 1950. Wages rose, to an average of 7,668 roubles per annum in 1950, representing an increase of roughly 16 per cent over 1947,<sup>27</sup> and there was indeed a sharp and striking recovery in living standards. However, exaggerated claims have been made by Soviet statisticians. Thus incomes of 'workers and peasants' in 1950 were repeatedly alleged, to have been 62 per cent above 1940. Yet, as we have seen, the peasants' incomes were adversely affected by government policies, while

#### **318 Recovery and Reaction**

real wages had barely reached 1940 levels (the wage index stood at 191, the price index at 186, according to Malafeyev). One must allow for social and other services, but even so an increase of 62 per cent is plainly out of the question.

After 1950 the picture is complicated by a growing disparity between state and free-market prices, due to the fact that official price cuts were beyond the economically justified. Thus by 1953 free-market prices were roughly 30 per cent above official retail levels. Wages continued to increase, and must have reached 8,100 roubles per annum, while the official retail price index fell to 146. Taking into account the very high free-market prices of 1940 (they were then 75 per cent above official prices) and the relatively stable prices of services (rents, etc.), Soviet official sources claimed a cost-of-living index of 122 (1940 = 100) and that real wages in 1953 were 65 per cent above 1940. This was plainly a substantial exaggeration, out of line with the published volume of retail sales and of the output of consumers' goods. However, there certainly was an improvement in real wages, though over very low levels. These gains were very unevenly distributed. While, as we have seen, the 1946 wage increase had the effect of reducing differentials between low-paid and high-paid, there was no systematic revision of wage rates, and drift and inter-ministerial competition for labour led to the emergence of very marked discrepancies and illogicalities, which, in the absence of a Ministry of Labour, was no one's responsibility to correct. Not until 1956 was there a move to bring order into the wages structure.

To some extent this was facilitated by the severe burdens placed on the peasants. One must also make allowance for the very great shortage of housing, which the modest building programmes of these years did nothing to remedy. Stalin was at this stage fond of encouraging the erection of new skyscrapers with decorated towers, while maintenance of existing houses was disgracefully neglected. It was quite normal for a four-room flat to be occupied by four families, one in each room, sharing kitchen and bathroom (if any). Rents were low, it is true, but the persistence of such conditions for a generation and more did much to cause unhappiness and to coarsen life.

The average 1950 wage, 7,668 roubles, was much higher than

the 6,000 envisaged in the five-year plan. But the latter was drafted before the substantial increases in retail prices decreed in 1946, and the wage increases which accompanied them. In the same way, retail trade turnover for 1950 was planned on the assumption of much lower prices than in fact ruled. So the original plan was knocked sideways.

A source of pressure on goods and services was the larger number of 'workers and employees' in the state sector: 39.2 instead of the planned 33.5 million. This caused some unplanned increase in total disposable incomes, as well as an extra strain on the inadequate housing in towns.

No doubt this also contributed to a constant pressure on the poorly developed trade network. Queues were the rule rather than the exception. Stalin's rationalization of goods shortages was frequently quoted at this time: 'The increase of mass consumption [purchasing power] constantly outstrips the growth of production and pushes it forward.<sup>28</sup> Queues therefore could be made to seem a progressive feature of a socialist economy.

#### Finance

During the war extra direct taxes replaced part of the turnover taxes which were lost through the reduction in turnover. We have seen that these additional taxes were abolished at the end of 1945. Thereafter, turnover tax became once again the dominant source of revenue, particularly after the very substantial retail price increases of 1946. Profits were low until after the price reform of 1949, which eliminated the bulk of the subsidies and greatly increased budgetary revenue from profits. This is reflected in the figures in the table on p. 320.

It is noteworthy that turnover tax revenue was more or less stable after 1948, while sales of consumers' goods rose very substantially indeed (retail trade turnover in 1952 was 393.6 million roubles, 19 per cent above 1947 by value, but 135 per cent above it in volume).<sup>29</sup> The price reductions of those years were largely made possible by reductions in rates of tax while turnover tax revenues were maintained by the increased volume. Quite clearly, the tax

burden on consumers' goods was much lower in 1952 than in 1947.

The increase in yield of direct taxes was due partly to the impact of unchanged income tax rates on increased incomes, partly to the upward revision in the 'agricultural tax' levied on peasant private plots (see p. 308). Bond sales were maintained at a high level.

This was a period of maximum centralization. The bulk of state investments were financed out of the budget. The republics' powers over the financing of enterprises created within their horders were minimal

#### Transport

The reconstruction of the railways after war damage was a great achievement. As statistics cited (page 298) have shown, the railways surpassed their freight plan. This required great efforts, and in September 1948 political departments were re-created on the railways.

It must be borne in mind that over-fulfilment of transport plans is not always a sign of health: it might mean unnecessary crosshauls, or mistakes in the planning of industrial location. In more recent years the authorities have rightly realized this. However, in the first post-war years the volume of freight carried did represent some rough index of recovery of the system.

Freight was given priority, and passengers without official reasons for travelling often faced long delays and queues. (In fact as late as 1956, when travelling in the Ukraine, I met peasants who had waited forty-eight hours for a train, and then could travel only after paying a 'soft-class' supplement.)

The equipment of the railways had been vastly improved in the thirties. But the introduction of new ideas slowed down, possibly reflecting the increasing age of key party figures, notably Kaganovich, who retained a kind of overlordship with regard to transport. He apparently expressed a preference for steam traction, or so his enemies later alleged, and diesel and electrification developments were delayed.

Large-scale canal construction was undertaken in Stalin's last years. The Volga-Don canal was one of many such projects. It is doubtful whether their economic value repaid the heavy expenditure involved.

### Foreign Trade: Comecon

The Soviet Union emerged from the war no longer isolated, no longer the world's only communist-ruled state. We have seen how, in the very hard first years of peace, the policy was to dismantle and acquire by way of reparations anything that could be taken from an ex-enemy state, even if it had now become allied with the Soviet Union.

Meanwhile, the cold war was developing, and this affected the trade behaviour of both sides in the conflict. The Marshall Plan proposals were put to a conference in Paris on 27 June-2 July 1947. Molotov represented the Soviet Union, which turned down the proposals and exerted pressure to ensure that their allies did likewise. In retrospect, we could say that the Marshall Plan could scarcely have been accepted by Congress had the American government not presented it as a measure to combat communism. This suggests that Molotov could have caused tactical embarrassment to Washington by agreeing to the plan, but aid would not necessarily have been granted to the USSR if he had done so.

Moscow reacted to this and other elements of the cold-war situation by tightening its grip on the political systems of the countries that were now fast becoming its satellites.

#### **322 Recovery and Reaction**

As these countries slid further into a condition of political subservience they became subject to Stalin's will in matters of trading relations with the Soviet Union. Since there was no precedent for a theory covering trade policy between socialist countries, and since the priority of the Soviet Union's interest had become an article of faith among communists at this time, there were unequal trade treaties from which the USSR benefited somewhat one-sidedly. The extent of such benefits has been exaggerated by propagandists, and cannot be precisely measured. Thus Poland supplied the USSR with coal at extremely low prices, but against this it is necessary to set the fact that the Soviet Union also supplied Poland with materials below world market prices. None the less, the fact that two ministers of foreign trade (in Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia) were executed quite specifically for bargaining too hard with the Soviet Union suggests that bargaining was not really equal.<sup>30</sup> After Yugoslavia's defection (1948), Stalin became deeply suspicious of nationalist deviations, and a great many communists in all East European countries were shot or imprisoned for giving too great weight to their countries' national interests.

But some sort of answer was needed to the Marshall Plan. The Soviet Union made a series of gestures: credit agreements were negotiated with Yugoslavia (25 July 1947), Bulgaria (9 August 1948), Czechoslovakia (7 December 1948). Half of the Romanian and Hungarian reparations debts were written off (9 June 1948). East German reparation debts were not halved until May 1950. And finally the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon) was set up in Moscow in January 1949.<sup>31</sup> Yugoslavia was by then excluded - and subject to total trade embargo following the Stalin-Tito break in 1948.

Comecon in fact led a sleepy and inactive existence until well after Stalin's death, and the USSR's relations with its satellites were conducted, at this period, almost exclusively on a bilateral basis.

Trade relations with the West were meanwhile becoming increasingly affected by the prevailing political tension. This culminated in the Korean war, and the imposition by the West of far-reaching restrictions on trade with communist countries. This compelled them all to trade to an increasing extent with each other. East Germany and Czechoslovakia in particular had highly developed industries, and they became major suppliers of machinery and equipment to the USSR.

The triumph of the communists in China in 1949 was followed by the granting of substantial credits by the Soviet Union; thus on 14 February 1950 the USSR granted China a credit of \$300 million at 1 per cent interest. These and other economic aid agreements were accompanied, during the Korean war, by military aid programmes designed to help China and North Korea.

No aid agreements involving countries outside the Soviet sphere of influence were negotiated until after Stalin's death. The dictator took the view that the process of decolonization was in some sense a fraud, that Nehru was probably a Western agent.

One odd feature of the year 1950 was the decision to increase the nominal gold and foreign exchange value of the already greatly overvalued rouble, from 5.30 to 4.00 roubles to the US dollar. This made all Soviet prices much too high. However, trade with Western countries was conducted in Western currencies, and there was no connection at all between internal prices, foreign trade decisions and the official exchange rate. Or rather the connection was purely one of statistics and accountancy. The rate was used to convert foreign currency into roubles, and thus Soviet exporting corporations, under the Ministry of Foreign Trade, tended to make large losses, which had to be made good out of the budget, while importing corporations made large profits, which were transferred mostly to the budget. It was, of course, quite impossible to use the exchange rate as a basis for economic calculation.

## The Atmosphere of Late-Stalinism: Science and Prolitics

A Soviet commentator wrote:

The cult of Stalin's personality had a negative effect on the economic development of the country. The fact that Stalin decided all important questions himself led to errors in plans and the lessening of the creative activity of party, planning and managerial organs; many questions were decided without sufficiently wide discussion among the workers, engineer-technicians and scientists. In planning and direction of the economy over-centralization was dominant. Insufficient steps were taken to combat technological know-alls and conservatism, which infected part of the leading cadres of the party and higher management.<sup>32</sup>

What precisely did the Soviet critic have in mind? After all, statistics of growth were most satisfactory.

The quantitative gains were indeed impressive. But quality and technical progress both suffered. Everyone was rewarded above all for fulfilling output plans, and the planners, under pressure to expand production, proceeded on what has been called 'the ratchet principle': that more should be made of everything. This led to several defects. Firstly, the simplest way to produce more is to go on making the same designs. Therefore, unless the particular item was given detailed attention at the very top, there was a marked tendency to go on making obsolete equipment. Secondly, the *pattern* of production was to a great extent frozen: thus the output of coal, oil and electric current was increased in like proportions, whereas in America non-solid fuels were making spectacular relative gains. New products, such as plastics and synthetics, or a new and highly economical fuel, natural gas, were neglected. Such defects had other contributory causes. Thus planning by 'material balances', like the use of input-output tables, is of its nature based on past experience and is thus 'conservative'. Also the ministerial system of administration led to competition between ministries for investment resources, and in the absence of any usable or recognized economic criteria of choice, investments often went to industries with most

political pull, or at best were simply distributed proportionately. A weak industry, such as chemicals, was probably because of its very weakness lacking in weight in the struggle for a share in investment allocations, and so, while in the West chemicals were bounding ahead, this sector remained underdeveloped in the USSR. Matters were not helped by the 'anti-cosmopolitan' campaign, which led to the claims that everything had been invented in Russia and that there was nothing to be learnt in the decadent West.

A change of policy required decisions to be taken at the top. The matter could be quite small and technical. Thus, I accompanied a Soviet agricultural delegation in England in 1955, when Stalin's pathological anti-Westernism was over. They saw numerous small wheeled tractors and their many attachments and uses. Yet, because the current party line favoured large caterpillar tractors, they simply did not dare to discuss or envisage their introduction in Russia, where they were in fact badly needed. (A few years later they were in mass production in the Soviet Union, but by then Khrushchev had brought his personal influence to bear.) Even ministers at this time could exercise few decisionmaking powers, judging from severe criticisms which accompanied the extension of these powers in 1953 (see next chapter). But the 'top' (Stalin and his immediate entourage) could take cognizance of only a fraction of problems that arose, and usually they could be prevailed upon to take a decision on a matter only if it had got badly out of hand. And the top men's behaviour was now very different from the leap-forward period. Stalin himself was more arbitrary and unpredictable than ever. His closest collaborators were no longer rabble-rousing innovators of the type of Ordzhonikidze, who could take and give responsibility. Stalin stayed in the Kremlin; his immediate subordinates became accustomed to a sedentary life. Even Kaganovich sat in his office, and we have already seen that he was blamed for technical conservatism in matters of rail transport. After the fall of Voznesensky, the top planners were mainly rather lustreless bureaucrats. Though the mass purges were not repeated, a great many people remained in camps, arrests were still a common occurrence, fear of responsibility was still a great cause of waste. So was a

tendency to 'please the boss' by adopting spectacular rather than economically sensible methods. So initiative at lower levels was stultified, or distorted. Thus output rose, but the pattern and quality of products, and investment policy too, no longer measured up to the needs of a by now developed industrial economy. Whole areas of backwardness persisted.

In these years the political leaders sought to establish 'little Stalins' at the head of each branch of science and the arts. It is in this context that Lysenko was allowed or encouraged to destroy genetics. Contacts with world science were systematically broken off. Even Einstein's theories were attacked, but in most of the natural sciences and in mathematics the top scientists (who were of exceedingly high quality) succeeded in preserving their disciplines from serious damage.

It was not so with economics. The subject was altogether too close to politics, and any serious discussion of economic issues or of objective criteria was inconsistent with the political arbitrariness which reached its peak in the period 1947-53. It is true that there was a brief false spring in the first post-war year. Novozhilov published some original thoughts which foreshadowed his later doctrines (of which more in Chapter 12), and Varga, a leading international economist of Hungarian origin, produced an analysis of Western capitalism which challenged traditional dogmas. Both were severely castigated in 1947-8, and Varga's Institute of World Economics was closed down (but neither was arrested). Unofficial discussion of economic issues was further obstructed by an almost total close-down on publication of statistics. Incomes, outputs, labour, even the size of population, were hidden by a uniquely tight censorship.

In 1952 Stalin's last published work appeared. It was entitled 'Economic problems of socialism in the USSR', and was a collection of his writings in connection with the preparation of a textbook on political economy. (It may seem surprising that Stalin had time for such exercises, but it must be recalled that he aspired to the status of philosopher-king and therefore had to produce *obiter dicta* on a variety of issues. In 1950 it was on linguistics. No one else was allowed any intellectual innovation.)

In his last work Stalin expressed a number of thoughts which

need not detain us in the present context. However, three points are directly relevant to our theme. One was his warning to officialdom that they must take economic laws into account though he did not clarify how economic laws were to be identified. His assertion that transfer prices within the state sector were outside the ambit of the 'law of value' obscured the issue of rational prices. The second was his order to economists to keep out of practical affairs: 'The rational organization of the production forces, economic planning, etc., are not problems of political economy, but of the economic policy of the directing bodies. They are two provinces which must not be confused.'<sup>33</sup> Thirdly, he expressed his belief in the need 'gradually to raise kolkhoz property to the status of state property' and 'to replace commodity circulation [i.e. sales and purchases by kolkhozes] by a system of products exchange'.<sup>34</sup> This is an interesting throw-back to the ideas of 1920 and 1930, and may help to explain Stalin's reluctance to consider proposals to increase agricultural procurement prices (though he did nothing in his last years to convert kolkhozes into state farms). In the name of the same principle he rejected suggestions by the agricultural economists Venzher and Sanina to sell or transfer the machinery of the MTS to the kolkhozes: this would be disposing of state property to an inferior, merely cooperative group of enterprises, and furthermore it would result in increasing the role of money and trade, since the produce handed over in payment for MTS services would now be sold. He would have none of it. (The MTS were liquidated in 1958.)

### Stalin's Last Years: The Nineteenth Congress and the Fifth Five-year Plan

Economic policy in 1951 and 1952 followed, with few exceptions, the lines already indicated. State retail prices were cut in March in both years, by a total of about 14 per cent. Yet already in 1950 free-market prices were 10 per cent above official prices. The disparity increased steadily: it was 17 per cent in 1951, 20 per cent in 1952.<sup>35</sup> Evidently the increase in real income in these years cannot be accurately based on the uncorrected use of the official index of retail prices. Price cuts had become a political habit.

The increased strain in retail trade, and in the supply of some materials, was no doubt contributed to by the effect of the cold war on arms expenditure and on manpower. The total strength of the armed forces increased from 2,874 million in 1948 to 5,763 million in 1955,<sup>36</sup> and presumably much of the increase had already occurred by 1952. Military budgets rose year by year:

|                          | 1950  | 1951                   | 1952  |

*(Source:* **Annual budget reports in** *Ek. zk***)** 

In real terms the increase was greater, since prices were falling.

No doubt for this reason the output of some products which used potentially military productive capacity fell in these years. Thus tractor production reached 116,700 in 1950, but fell to 93,100 and 98,900 in 1951 and 1952, and was only 111,300 in 1953. But the economy was now stronger than in the late thirties, and there was much less disruption of civilian production this time.

The new five-year plan was supposed to begin in 1951, but no announcement was made. Through most of 1952 not even a draft five-year plan was referred to. Finally, a plan covering the five years 1951-5 was presented to the nineteenth party congress in October 1952 and approved unanimously. We do not know whether an unpublished long-term plan existed in 1951-2, or whether the worsening of the international situation led to a postponement in the drafting of such a plan.

Industrial output was due to increase by 70 per cent in the five years, which represented a slowdown compared with the rate of growth claimed for the previous quinquennium, but this could be readily explained by the gradual end of post-war reactivation of damaged enterprises. (This was still a significant factor even as

late as 1953, as is shown by the fact that five factories begun or completed before the war and important enough to be mentioned by name in a 'catalogue' of economic events covering the period 1917-59 started production only in the first quarter of 1953.)<sup>37</sup> National income was to rise by 60 per cent, real wages by 35 per cent, peasant incomes by 40 per cent. Agricultural production was to increase by large percentages: the grain crop by 40-50 per cent, meat production by 80-90 per cent, milk by 45-50 per cent. (Details of plan targets and fulfilment will be given in Chapter **12.)** 

Yet, until after Stalin's death, nothing was done to increase the miserably inadequate income of the kolkhoz peasantry. Indeed, the tax screw was actually tightened, and the final twist was given in January 1953, with a demand that the 'agricultural tax' (on private plots) be paid earlier in the year than usual.<sup>38</sup> The livestock population began to show a downward trend. One is at a loss to explain such actions; did none of his comrades dare to tell Stalin what conditions were like in the villages?

But there is some evidence of the beginning of rethinking. Certain prices - for milk and flax, for instance - were increased in 1952, though with so little publicity that it was necessary to search for references to any such decisions;<sup>39</sup> and publication was allowed of very severe criticisms of the arbitrary and inefficient rural planning methods; this was ignored by the nineteenth party congress which met in the same month.<sup>40</sup>

There were relatively few organizational changes in Stalin's last two years. Major changes had to wait until after the death of the great dictator. On 5 March 1953 his henchmen found themselves successors to his heritage, a great country, the second military and industrial power, yet one with many weaknesses, unevenly developed. Great scientific achievements had been made but the housing situation was still appalling, consumers' goods of poor quality, the villages primitive. Even within a single sector, grain cultivation for instance, large modern combine-harvesters were used alongside totally unmechanized hand operations in the process of cleaning, drying, loading. What was to be done about over-centralization, lack of acceptable (or accepted) investment criteria, agricultural prices, the defiencies of the trading network,

the breakdowns in material supplies? How could it be tolerated that a country capable of making an A-bomb could not supply its citizens with eggs? How could necessary initiative be encouraged under conditions of terror?

On the morrow of Stalin's death his successors called for the avoidance of 'panic and disarray'. How they faced the problems which they inherited is the subject of the next chapter (while the whole question of the Stalin epoch and its significance is left to be discussed in a concluding assessment).
