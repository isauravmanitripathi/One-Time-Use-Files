# The Second Five-Year Plan

The present chapter covers the period in which the 'Stalin' economic model established itself. The convulsions which characterized the years of frantic industrialization and collectivization were replaced by more orderly and systematic methods of planning and administration. Sufferings and excesses were followed by a more tolerable life. True, Stalin's slogan, 'Life has become better, comrades, life has become more joyous', became an excuse for evading some disagreeable realities, since living standards were low in town and country alike, compared with 1928. None the less, a period of relaxation did undoubtedly begin in 1934, and a rapid improvement was maintained, in output of all kinds of industrial goods, for three years. Then came a sharp check to economic growth, and we will be discussing how far this can be attributed to a shift of resources into military preparation and to the impact of the police terror which reached its apogee in the years 1937-8.

But first we must return to the second five-year plan. In Chapter 8 it was shown that this plan, covering the period 1933^7, was originally drafted during the period of 'great leapforward' psychology, and that the original targets were wild and utterly unrealistic. But by the end of 1932 it became clear that the economy was overstrained. 1933 was a year characterized not only by famine but also by the transport crisis, and by disequilibria and shortages so severe that it was necessary to call a halt. We saw that the volume of investment declined by 14.3 per cent in 1933, and gross industrial production, which had risen (according to the official claims) by an average of close to 20 per cent per annum in the years 1929-32, increased by only 5 per cent in 1933. Many key industries made no progress at all. It plainly became essential to redraft the five-year plan, and this was done during 1933, although this was supposed to be the first year of the plan period. The five-year plan was adopted by the seventeenth party congress, at its sessions in February 1934.

So 1933 was, in an important sense, the concluding year of a period, or perhaps a compulsory breathing-space occasioned by 'leap-forward' overstrain. This is why many aspects of that year were considered in the previous chapter, despite the fact that it was the first year of the second five-year plan.

The plan as it finally emerged included the target figures shown in the table on p. 228 (the actual 1937 achievements are also given).

Attention must at once be drawn to certain misleading features of the table. First of all, the plan fulfilment figures are highly suspect when they refer to any aggregate sum in roubles. For reasons already mentioned, these tend to overstate reality. Therefore the claim to have over-fulfilled the industrial plan in aggregate terms is not to be taken literally. How indeed can one reconcile it with the under-fulfilment of the plans for almost every major item, which emerges clearly from the table? Even if one allows for the large increase in arms production, and the very good showing of the machinery sector, something seems awry.

Secondly, certain individual figures are misleadingly low, others high. Thus the tractor output of 1937 (66,500 in 15 h.p. units) was very far below that of 1936. Presumably, had there not been a shift towards tank production, the original plan estimate would have been substantially over-fulfilled, since the 1936 figure (173,000, expressed in 15 h.p. units) was actually higher than had been intended for 1937. By contrast, the grain harvest in 1937 was abnormally high, due to very favourable weather, so in this instance the use of a single year's results overstates actual achievements.

But above all, the table conceals a very uneven pattern of growth. 1933 was a bad year. This was followed by three exceptionally favourable years, when all the evidence shows that there were great achievements in industry, construction and transport,

though agricultural recovery was adversely affected by bad weather in 1936. In 1937 began a period of relative stagnation. This is shown particularly clearly in the key metallurgical sector. The figures were as follows:

However, let us look at the second five-year plan first of all as a statement of intent. It was a more fully worked-out plan than the first, covering greater detail by industry and by region, and the document includes an impressive list of academic and other consultants involved, in 1932-3, in the work of preparation. The three guiding principles were: firstly, *consolidation,* or bringing into effective operation *(osvoeniye);* secondly, *mastering technique,*  and thirdly, a special effort in the direction of *improving living standards.* The plan envisaged a larger increase in output of, and investment in, consumers' goods rather than producers' goods. Whatever may have been the ritual phrases about the good life, Stalin and his colleagues must have understood and appreciated the urgency of remedial action. In the first plan-period priority went almost exclusively to heavy industry. Now something would be done to redress the balance. Collectivization would be completed, but the collectivized peasants would live much better, with a very much larger number of private (as well as collective) livestock, and urban real wages would double, as a result of an increase in money wages and a simultaneous fall in retail prices, as shown in the table above. Optimistic assumptions were made about productivity: an increase by 63 per cent in large-scale industry. As money wages were to rise on average by only 23 per cent, costs of production were to fall by substantial percentages. Housing conditions would improve through an addition of 64 million square metres of space, which would increase the total space by about 40 per cent.

Reality proved very different. The plan was, evidently, altered drastically as the year went by, with a shift again towards heavy industry. The result was that the consumers' goods, housing and real wages plans were not fulfilled.

The basic reasons for this shift are not so easy to determine. They obviously include, as a major factor, the rise of Hitler. In 1933 the Nazis won in Germany and made no secret of their

determination to make war on the Soviet Union. The Soviet armed forces were still poorly equipped, and the young heavyindustrial sector had to be switched over to manufacture not only arms but also the means of making arms of all kinds. The increase in arms expenditure is somewhat overstated in the table below, in that prices were rising. However, the growing share of defence in the budget is clear.

*(Source: Sotsialisticheskoe narodnoe khozyaistvo v 1933-40* **(Moscow, 1963), pp. 609-11 and K. Plotnikov,** *Ocherki istorii byudzheta sovetskovo gosudarstva*  **(Moscow, 1954), P- 255)** 

In the period 1933-8, according to the above source, the output of the defence industry increased by 286 per cent, and in 1934-9 the armed forces doubled in size, taking away many of the most productive men and machines.

However, while accepting this as a major cause of the recasting of the plan, one is forced to remember that this kind of revision occurred also in 1930, when Hitler was still a powerless rabblerouser; and even under Khrushchev, many years later, one saw the tendency to take less seriously those plan objectives which concern the needs of citizens and to give top priority to heavy industry. In so far as the second five-year plan was over-sanguine in its forecasts, probably the consumers' goods and housing goals would have been sacrificed to some extent even if the Nazis had not come to power.

Be this as it may, the international situation was certainly

responsible in some considerable part for the fact, to be further investigated, that real wages rose by 'at least 20 per cent' (Malafeyev) instead of doubling; that only forty-two, not sixtyfour million square metres of housing was built, and so on. (Let it be said at once that real wages must in reality have risen by more than 20 per cent, since the index used by Malafeyev does not allow sufficiently for shortages and rationing in 1932.)

## Industrial Growth and Productivity

Whatever the validity of certain official claims, it remains true beyond question that the second five-year plan period was one of impressive achievement, as is clear from the commodity statistics in the table on p. 228. (It may be worth reminding readers that doubts about officially claimed growth rates are confined, in industry at least, to aggregate totals such as national income or gross industrial output.) The excellent growth rates recorded in the years 1934-6 were in large part due to the completion of big plants begun in the hard years of 1929—33; for example, the Magnitogorsk, Kuznetsk, Zaporozhye, 'Azovstal", Tula and Lipetsk metallurgical works were wholly or partly brought into operation during these years.' There was a most impressive leap forward, too, in the machinery and metal-working sector, which is insufficiently reflected in the above table. Both in volume and in degree of sophistication the advances recorded in these years did help to transform the whole balance of industry and to diminish very substantially the USSR's dependence on foreign countries for its capital goods. This dependence was very great indeed during the first five-year plan. In 1932, 338 million roubles' worth of machine tools were imported, and this represented 78 per cent of all machine tools installed in that year.<sup>2</sup> In 1936 and 1937 less than 10 per cent of machine tools were imported. Total purchases of all kinds of machinery and equipment fell substantially. This greatly relieved the strain on the balance of payments, and debts incurred in the preceding period were paid off.

Of course, the USSR continued to import machinery (and still

does so on a large scale). However, such imports could be concentrated on specialized equipment, or on items which the USSR had not yet succeeded in developing. The basic tools of industrialization, and of arms production, were, by 1937, made in the Soviet Union.

Other branches of industry also showed very significant gains, though without fulfilling the very optimistic forecasts of the planners. Coal production increased substantially in the Kuzbas (Siberia), in Karaganda and in the Urals, and mechanization and training enabled productivity per miner to rise from 16.2 tons in 1932 to 26.9 tons in 1937.<sup>3</sup> A principal cause of the failure to fulfil the plan was delay in completing new mines. Electricity generation expanded particularly rapidly in 1934-6, the average growth rate being 26 per cent per annum. However, as also in metallurgy and in many other branches of industry, there was a marked slowdown in and after 1937. The least satisfactory among the fuel industries was oil. The Baku fields were unable to cope with their plans, and the rich Urals-Volga oil area, which had already been discovered, was developed much too slowly, owing to 'the weakness of the technical equipment in the area, a very large labour turnover due to poor housing conditions, and the backwardness of geological surveying and drilling work'.<sup>4</sup> Another extractive industry, iron ore, also lagged behind, and this was one cause of the subsequent difficulties in the production of ferrous metal.

Industrialization led, as was expected, to a very rapid expansion of demand for non-ferrous metals, and plans were made accordingly. While production did increase, demand grew faster, and imports continued. Copper production and import statistics were as follows:

|                            | 1932 | 1937 |
|----------------------------|------|------|
| Production (thousand tons) | 45   | 99   |
| Imports (thousand tons)    | 12   | 65   |

*(Source: Sots. nar. khoz., 1933-40,* pp. 216, 626.)

The supply of many non-ferrous metals continued to be a bottleneck.

The chemical industry grew, but here again the plan was not fulfilled. Branches of special interest to armaments production, and synthetic rubber, did a great deal better than did mineral fertilizer. There were inevitable difficulties in expanding this very backward branch of industry: lack of experience among management and labour alike, delays in construction, and so forth.

Consumers' goods industries also advanced, though, with the exception of footwear, at a pace well below plan. But the modernization of some textile and (especially) food-processing industries made big advances. New bakeries and ice-cream and meat-packing plants opened in many areas. In comparison with the hard years of the early thirties much more was available. More could be spent on imports of raw materials for the textile industry, but still not enough, especially in view of the disastrous losses of sheep in the USSR. This explains the very great shortfall, in relation to plan, of wool cloth production. At this period, too, a few consumer durables made their appearance, notably gramophones and bicycles.

The regional balance was changing. The Urals-Kuznetsk combine has been referred to already. Non-ferrous metal mining grew rapidly in Central Asia and Kazakhstan; an industrial complex was arising based on the Karaganda coalfield; new factories appeared in Baku and a sizeable modern textile mill was built in Tashkent. There was a conscious effort to develop the more backward national republics, even where it was not economically the most rational way of using scarce resources.

## Labour

Productivity in the economy as a whole rose substantially in these years, at least up to 1937. As the table on p. 228 shows, the number of employed persons in total, and also in industry, was below plan, in striking contrast to the situation in the first fiveyear plan. We must now examine the reasons for this favourable development.

Firstly, *incentives* were made much more effective, by the recasting of the wage scales and widening monetary differentials,

then by the gradual abolition of rationing and the greater availability of goods to buy (see p. 212). The very high prices of basic necessities, in and after 1934, stimulated harder work on piecerates, so as to be able to make ends meet. This same problem also caused many more wives to go out to work.

Secondly, *training schemes* at all levels were gradually transforming the labour force. In 1930-33 unskilled peasant labour caused many breakdowns and was exceedingly inefficient, as well as unpunctual; labour turnover was very high. In 1933 a survey carried out in Moscow showed that only 17 per cent of those recruited to industry in that year had any skill or qualifications. Even in 1935, 60 per cent of workers in the great Urals machinery factory were unskilled.<sup>5</sup> Training schemes of many kinds were brought into being: apprenticeship on the job, courses run by enterprises, technical colleges run by industries, the so-called FZU or factory training schools, and so on. Some errors were committed because of the great shortage of trained instructors, and some courses were so accelerated that they produced poorquality craftsmen; therefore training was lengthened, numbers were cut. In 1938 and 1939 FZU schools trained only 320,000 skilled workers, though the plan had specified 1,700,000.' This was partly due to the rapid expansion of 'academic' secondary education. In 1940 this led, as we shall see, to compulsory call-up of youth for training. But whatever the errors and omissions, a huge task was performed and a more efficient working class was created. Similarly, very great strides were made in higher technological education, with every effort made to educate the abler and more energetic workers. Since many of these had not had a secondary education, the results were not always happy, but by 1936 an expanded secondary school system was able to provide the recruits to the universities and technological institutes, and a decree regulating entry and demanding a more effective system of education dates from 23 June of that year. Stalin's slogan, 'Cadres decide everything' (speech of 4 May 1935), was designed to emphasize the urgency of the need for better-qualified and trained staffs. Their pay and privileges were enhanced. The following figures show (in thousands) the extent of the increase in their numbers in the course of twelve years:

|      | 1941 (1 January)               |
|------|--------------------------------|
|      | 908.0                          |
|      | 289.9                          |
|      | 1492.2                         |
| 51.0 | 320.1                          |
|      | 1928<br>233.0<br>47.0<br>288.0 |

But here too there was some reduction in entrants after a great rush forward earlier in the decade, which had affected quality. The number of students accepted for higher education was 245,000 in 1932, and only 158,300 in 1937.<sup>7</sup>

Thirdly, prominent among the reasons for improved productivity was the so-called Stakhanovite movement. This was a complex phenomenon which deserves careful attention. It emerged out of the 'socialist competition' and shock-brigade campaigns, which grew rapidly in scope and intensity during the first five-year plan period. They were linked with efforts to encourage enterprises to offer to achieve more technical progress, output, cost reduction and productivity than was originally proposed. These were the so-called counter-plans *(vstrechnye tekhpromfinplany),* and rankand-file workers were brought into the task of ensuring that every enterprise and workshop undertook to go well beyond existing norms. It was in this context that a coal miner, Alexei Stakhanov, achieved output fourteen times greater than the norm, in September 1935. He did this not just by working hard, but also by intelligent use of unskilled auxiliaries. The party took this up, and 'Stakhanovism' spread rapidly to other branches of the economy. The December 1935 plenum of the party's central committee decided to urge planners and managers to revise upwards the existing technological and labour norms. Higher productivity 'would make the USSR the most prosperous country in the world'. The effect of all this was to use equipment more fully and to intensify and rationalize labour. No one can doubt that there was ample scope for such things in 1935. Norms were low, having been based on the inefficiencies of the early thirties. 'Stakhanovism' was a means of dramatizing and publicizing a necessary change. Following a series of conferences held early in 1936 work norms were very sharply raised: by 30-40 per cent in

engineering, 34 per cent in chemicals, 51 per cent in electricity generation, 26 per cent in coal mining, 25-29 per cent in the oil industry, and so on.<sup>8</sup> Despite this, and some reductions in piecerates, total earnings rose on balance. No doubt the campaign had a positive effect on productivity.

However, some of the undertakings made were clearly excessive: e.g. to double the output of sulphuric acid without any new capital equipment or to 'double or treble our so-called projected utilization of productive capacity' (this last was said by the young Khrushchev).<sup>9</sup> Speed-up and higher work norms caused much strain in sectors in which there was no easy way of increasing output per man. Many a 'Stakhanovite' team was given favourable treatment by managers, who expected to benefit from the publicity which accompanied record-breaking, at the cost of neglecting the interests of the rest of the workers. Naturally, this was resented, and some 'Stakhanovites' were threatened or even beaten.

Work norms were further increased, especially in 1938 and 1939, but in most cases they were still surpassed, by fairly large percentages.

Discipline improved throughout the economy, due partly to stronger penalties for absenteeism; these were not yet criminal penalties, but took the form of administrative fines, threatened expulsion from the union (and therefore partial loss of social insurance benefits), dismissals with loss of housing space. Even failure to attend training courses outside working hours was held to be absenteeism.<sup>10</sup>

A particularly welcome improvement was recorded in the building industry. In the first five-year plan period the bulk of the labour force was exceedingly unskilled and footloose. There was a steady shift later in the decade towards the creation of permanent, as against *ad hoc,* building enterprises, and this helped to reduce labour turnover. This, and the introduction of more labour-saving equipment, made possible a substantial reduction in numbers employed on construction and installation: these fell from 2,289,000 in 1932 to 1,576,000 in 1937, yet the value of work rose by almost 45 per cent."

## **Transport**

Productivity increased impressively in rail transport, which had been a very weak spot in 1933 and 1934. Due to better organization and equipment (bigger locomotives and wagons, better track, etc.), a very marked improvement was achieved, from a total of 239,400 to 356,700 ton-kilometre equivalents per railway employee in the period 1933 to 1937.<sup>12</sup> Yet even as late as 1936 there was a labour turnover of 103.8 per cent, i.e. the average worker left after less than a year.

The railways had to bear a particularly heavy burden. Owing to lack of roads, and the fact that rivers froze in winter, plus the very great distance over which it was necessary to carry such bulky items as coal and ores, the railway system was the key to the entire plan. Lack of modern rolling-stock, the poor quality of rails, inadequate ballast, made things very difficult. In 1932 the average speed of goods trains was less than nine miles per hour. The great efforts made did produce some very creditable results. Responsibility for the freight plan was centralized in 1934, in the-People's Commissariat of Transport, which imposed priorities determined by the government. Since very few new lines were built in the old industrial areas, the existing lines were overloaded, and it was frequently necessary to reduce or cancel the movement of passenger trains. The total of freight and passengers carried in 1939 was 91.8 per cent higher than in 1932. But the most rapid rate of growth ended, here as elsewhere, in 1937.

In 1938 the performance of the transport system was very unsatisfactory; freight carried by the railways actually fell. The reason given: 'The majority of the railway managers and heads of political departments, and many of the leading cadres in the People's Commissariat of Transport, were dismissed and arrested.' There were also fuel crises in the winters of 1937—8 and 1938-9, which led to numerous cancellations of trains. Fuel shortages also hit road transport: shortage of oil led to the conversion of many vehicles to use gas-generators.<sup>13</sup>

## **The Industrial Slowdown and the Terror**

We must now return to the problem of the slowdown of 1937. This is not the same problem as that of the shift of resources away from the consumers' goods sector. We have seen that the metallurgy industry virtually stopped growing, and yet iron and steel was an essential part of the building of Soviet military capacity. What happened?

In the case of iron and steel, priority was given, during 1934-6, to the completion of plant already started. Little was done to press on with new construction in these years, due to 'imperfection in the planning of investment, and organization of fulfilment of the plan', plus 'lack of highly qualified construction staffs, and breakdown in supply of equipment and building materials'.<sup>14</sup> All these deficiencies seriously held back completion of plant. Furthermore, in 1936 there was 335 per cent reduction in investments in iron and steel as against 1935, and the lower 1936 level continued through to 1939.<sup>15</sup>

This was followed in 1937 by a drastic cutback in investments. According to an official Soviet recomputation expressed in 1955 prices, the investment figures (excluding kolkhozy) were as follows:

| Investments | (millions of roubles, prices ofigss) |  |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|--|
| 1932        | 2,350                                |  |
| 1933        | i,943                                |  |
| 1934        | 2,552                                |  |
| 1935        | 2,984                                |  |
| 1936        | 4,070                                |  |
| 1937        | 3,621                                |  |
| 1938        | 3,807                                |  |

*<sup>(</sup>Source: Nar. khoz., ig6o,* p. 590.)

There was a particularly severe drop in 1937 in construction work.

One reason for the slowdown, then, was this fall in investments,

occasioned probably by a shift of resources into the arms industry and the consequent shortages of skills and materials. But Soviet historians admit that another factor had an adverse effect on output and on planning at this period.

This factor was the great purge. It swept away a high proportion not only of leading party cadres, but also of army officers, civil servants, managers, technicians, statisticians, planners, even foremen. Everywhere there were said to be spies, wreckers, diversionists. There was a grave shortage of qualified personnel, so the deportation of many thousands of engineers and technologists to distant concentration camps represented a severe loss. But perhaps equally serious was the psychological effect of this terror on the survivors. With any error or accident likely to be attributed to treasonable activities, the simplest thing to do was to avoid responsibility, to seek approval from one's superiors for any act, to obey mechanically any order received, regardless of local conditions.

Already in Chapters 7 and 8 we have seen the spread of this hysteria into the administration of the economy, particularly in agriculture and the railways. It spread further in the worst years of the purge, paralysing thought and action. No one can tell how much economic damage was done by all this, but we can surely agree with those Soviet commentators who assert that the damage was serious. 'Breaches of socialist legality, mass repressions, caused an immense loss of economic cadres and disorganized the normal work of industry,' as an authoritative textbook put it.<sup>16</sup> Key planners were among the victims, including the Commissar of Finance, Grin'ko, and also Pyatakov, deputy to Ordzhonikidze, the latter being driven to suicide.

It is no part of the present work to analyse the causes of the great wave of terror, about which historians will doubtless still be arguing and debating well into the twenty-first century (if our world survives that long). The terror has, certainly, a largely political explanation, connected with Stalin's desire for absolute power, and other non-economic factors. It is sufficient here to stress only a few of its aspects. One, already mentioned, was its adverse economic effect. Another was the probable connection between the extreme harshness of the policies described in the

previous two chapters and the growth of police repression. Obviously, the dreadful struggle with the peasantry, and the sacrifices and strains of the industrialization drive, could not but give rise to resentment and bitterness, not only among ordinary folk but among party members too. We saw in Chapter 7 that local party officials were dismissed for pro-peasant ('pro-kulak') tendencies. No doubt the Stalin group also feared the exploitation of discontent by former oppositionists, which was why they arrested so many of them and compelled the leaders of the 'rights' and the 'lefts' to accuse themselves of treason and wrecking. Finally, the trials provided scapegoats. Shortages of consumers' goods, breakdowns in supply, errors in planning, could be attributed to malevolent plotting by enemies of the people, in the pay of Hitler, the Mikado, and 'Judas-Trotsky'. The published reports of the trials abound in economic self-accusation. Thus the shortage of eggs was supposedly due to the efforts of wreckers, who smashed eggs in transit just to deprive the Soviet people of the fruits of their labour and to create politically exploitable discontent. Or so the readers of *Pravda* were supposed to believe. Bukharin's - and other oppositionists' - doctrines would be publicly associated with treason, and thereby placed outside the area of legitimate discussion or comment.

A census of population was taken in January 1937, but it was soon declared invalid and its principal authors shot. We now know, from numerous extracts from archives (especially those by Polyakov and his associates<sup>17</sup>), that the total came to just over 162 million, although Stalin had announced a total of 168 million at the seventeenth party congress three years earlier. The census remained unpublished for over fifty years. Another census was taken in 1939. Evidence presented by Polyakov and others strongly suggests that the published total (170.5 million) was deliberately overstated by statisticians anxious to avoid the fate of their predecessors, and that the real figure was of the order of 167.5 million, or at most 168 million. On the other hand, archival evidence on the numbers in prisons and camps, presented by a number of sources,<sup>18</sup> shows it as well below many Western and some Soviet published estimates: the highest total in any one year is given as 2.5 million, but this excluded exiles of several

categories, for whom there are not as yet reliable figures for prewar years (these would include most of the deported kulaks). The total of surplus deaths in the 1930s, due to famine, deportations, shootings, appears to have been not far from 11 million, dreadful enough, even if lower than some published estimates. But such an estimate is not and cannot be a final one.

The quantity of published statistics began to decline in the middle thirties, and the material on the last years of peace is markedly deficient compared with the early years of the decade.

The third five-year plan period began in 1938, and was interrupted by the war. Its pattern and progress will be further discussed at the end of this chapter.

## Agriculture up to 1937

In Chapter 7 it was demonstrated that agriculture reached a state of acute crisis in the harvest year 1932-3. A slow recovery began with the relatively better harvest of 1933. The drive to collectivize the bulk of the remaining individual peasants was launched in 1934 and was practically completed in 1937, when almost 99 per cent of all cultivated land was included within collective or state farms. The proportion of peasants collectivized at this date was slightly smaller (93 per cent), but evidently the majority of the surviving 'individualists' earned a living other than by cultivating the soil, and they ceased to play any significant role in agriculture. By contrast, the private operations of collectivized peasants grew in importance, particularly in livestock. Indeed, the rapid recovery of the livestock population from the disasters of 1930-33 was in part due to the government's willingness to tolerate and even encourage private ownership of livestock, subject to maxima (see p. 245). The actual figures, in millions of heads, were as shown in the table on p. 242.

While livestock numbers were still below the precollectivization level, the great increase during the period 1933-^7 benefited everyone: there was more meat and milk in towns and villages, and revenues of both the farms and the peasants rose from sales of livestock products.

*(Source: SePskoe khozyaistvo SSSR* **(i960), pp. 263-4.)**  *Note:* **Some of the private livestock was owned by workers.** 

Grain output rose exceedingly slowly, though good weather in < 1937 resulted in a record harvest. For many years, as we have seen, statistics were given in terms of biological yield, and even these estimates 'were consciously overstated .. . so as to include the kolkhoz within a higher harvest category so that it should pay more produce for the services of the MTS'. " This motive grew in importance because these payments in kind became the largest single source of grain procurements during this decade, and the payments were related to the (nominal) size of the harvest.

The average grain yield for 1933^7 was said to have been 9.1 quintals per hectare, against 7.5 in 1928-32. But revised figures published in i960 gave the real figure for 1933-7 as on ly 7<sup>1</sup> - ^<sup>n</sup> other words, the yields actually fell. Only one year, 1936, was exceedingly unfavourable climatically, but this was balanced by the very good weather of 1937. The revised figures for total grain harvests are as follows:

|                  | 1933 | 1934 | »935 | 1936 | 1937 |
|------------------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Millions of tons | 68.4 | 67.6 | 75.0 | 56.1 | 97.4 |

*(Sources:* **Moshkov (for 1933-5);** *Nar. khoz., 1958,* **p. 418 (for 1937). Average for 1933-7 given in** *Sefskoe khozyaistvo SSSR*  **(i960). The 1936 figure is deduced from the above.)** 

While harvests (except in 1937) were below even the inadequate levels of 1928-32, procurements rose:

State procurements *(millions of tons)* 

1928-32 18.2 1933-7 27-5

In 1928—30 some grain was sold by peasants through private traders. None the less, less grain remained in the villages (except in 1937). The fall in the numbers of livestock, especially horses, reduced demand for grain and this relieved pressure somewhat. (We shall see that after 1937 the revival of the livestock population began to be severely limited by lack of fodder supplies.)

Procurement quotas were supposed to be based on the area sown or livestock owned by the given kolkhoz or peasant, and the authorities were not supposed to vary these quotas; but they did so arbitrarily, the needs of the state taking priority over all other considerations.

In 1933-4 one of the most severe problems was shortage of haulage power. In the five years following 1929 a net total of 17-2 million horses were lost; the amount of tractor horsepower increased by only three million, and there were few lorries. Poor maintenance, lack of skilled labour and of spares, ensured frequent breakdown of the tractors available. However, by 1937 tractor numbers had substantially increased, and there were more horses.

Therefore 1937 was in many respects a good year. We shall see that peasant consumption, of grain in particular, reached the highest point of any year in the period 1932-41.

## The Kolkhoz Congress and Model Statute

By 1935 the shape of the kolkhoz as an institution was more or less settled, and a congress was called to adopt a 'model statute', which remained the basis of kolkhoz organization until well into the sixties.

The kolkhoz was declared to be a voluntary cooperative, whose members had pooled their means of production in order to produce in common. The members ran their own affairs, and elected a chairman and a management committee responsible to a meeting of all members. The kolkhoz was, however, bound to obey instructions from local state and party organs on matters of agricultural production and procurements, so in practice its operational autonomy was severely limited. The *raion* (district) party organization, the MTS, the raion agricultural department, issued numerous orders to the chairman, and the party secretary in particular had the effective power of appointment and dismissal.

The payment of members was proportionate to the trudodni (work-day units) worked by each; all collective work was measured in these units, and more highly skilled occupations were wortli more trudodni than unskilled ones. The amount paid to a peasant, in cash and in kind, in any given year depended on two things: the number of trudodni he earned, and the worth of each trudoden'. The latter depended on the cash and produce available for distribution. Members shared the cash and produce which was left after other requirements had been met. Cash revenues were subject to deductions for taxes, insurance, the capital ('indivisible') fund, administrative and cultural expenses and production costs (e.g. purchase of fodder, seed, fuel). At the period we are describing this left, on average, 40-50 per cent of the gross cash revenue for distribution to peasants. We shall see that, owing very largely to the low prices paid, the sums in question were very small.

As for produce, payment was generally confined to grain, sometimes potatoes, often also hay (for private livestock). Compulsory deliveries to the state, payment in kind for MTS services, seed, fodder, relief for sick and aged people, all took priority. In spite of this, at this period roughly a third of the kolkhoz grain harvest was consumed by the peasants (or their animals).

The 'residuary legatee' status of the kolkhoz peasant, the lack of any guaranteed minimum income, inevitably led to very great variations between kolkhozes. It rendered impossible any calculation of costs, for what, in such circumstances, is the cost of labour? In fact until well after Stalin's death no such calculations were even attempted. But the system of payment had a logic, given the objective of taking out of agriculture all possible resources for the priority needs of industrialization.

The statute gave formal recognition of the right of the kolkhoz household to a private plot of land, amounting to between *\* and *\*  hectare in most of the country (i.e. an acre or less). Possession of livestock was limited to one cow and calves, one sow and piglets, four sheep, and any number of rabbits and poultry. Livestock was generally pastured on collective land. This private sector which Soviet statistics for some reason always treated as part of the socialized economy - long remained by far the most important element of private enterprise in the Soviet Union. The produce belonged to the peasants and, subject to compulsory delivery obligations to the state, they could eat it, or sell it in the legal free market.

In 1937 and for many years thereafter the collectives produced grain and industrial crops (e.g. cotton, sugar-beet, flax). In other produce the private sector was predominant. We have seen (on p. 242) that it outnumbered state farms and collectives in all categories of productive livestock, and therefore in the supply of meat and milk. It was almost the sole producer of eggs, and provided most of the potatoes, many of the vegetables, virtually all the fruit. The peasant household usually relied on its kolkhoz for bread grains, sometimes for potatoes, but the rest of the food, and the major part of the cash, came from their private holding. Thus in 1935 the average household received 247 roubles a year for collective work (which would buy them one pair of shoes), but must have obtained at least twice as much from sales in the free market.

Thus a kolkhoz household divided its time between collective and private activities, and its income was a combination of cash and produce paid for collective work, plus consumption of its own produce and cash from sales in the market and to the state. As payment for collective work was very poor, pressure had to be exercised to compel work to be done for the collective. This was formalized in 1939 by legislation requiring a compulsory minimum number of trudodni of all adult members.

Many kolkhoz members earned extra money from seasonal work for state enterprises, including state farms and forestry.

At the beginning of 1937 there were nearly 243,000 kolkhozes

and 3,992 state farms. The bulk of agriculture was undertaken by or within kolkhozes. Each averaged 76 households, 476 hectares of sown area, 60 cattle, 94 sheep, and 26 pigs. There were, of course, big regional variations, the farms being larger in the south and east. One MTS served at this period roughly 40 kolkhozes on the average, using kolkhoz labour on a large scale alongside its own paid specialists.

There are other sources of agricultural produce. There are allotments cultivated by state-employed persons (state farm workers, railwaymen, rural officials, dwellers in suburbs of big cities, etc.) who own some livestock. There are also very numerous small farms and market-gardens operated by non-agricultural state enterprises, and used to provide foodstuffs for the factory canteen or the enterprise's shop (ORS).

Agricultural production was discouraged by the exceedingly unfavourable price structure. While prices of cotton and some other industrial crops were substantially raised in 1934, prices of livestock products in 1933-7 hardly differed from those of 1928-9, and grain prices were only a little above 1928-9 levels. Yet the prices of industrial goods, and particularly those purchased by peasants, rose very greatly. Thus for instance the price of cotton cloth *(sitets,* calico) on 1 January 1928 was 34 kopeks per metre, while on 1 January 1937 it was 2.30-3.25 roubles, i.e. it increased seven to nine times. Prices for soap multiplied by five, for sugar by six, etc.<sup>20</sup> This was the price 'scissors' with a vengeance. It should be added that agriculture was neglected in other ways; even as late as 1940 only 4.2 per cent of kolkhozes had any electricity.<sup>21</sup> Any available mineral fertilizer was likely to be allocated to industrial crops.

Not very surprisingly, while cotton output rose very satisfactorily - production doubled during the decade - performance was much less satisfactory elsewhere. With prices at exceedingly low levels coercion became an essential element in relations between state and collective farms. Since incentives were lacking, 'there developed excessive centralism in the planning of kolkhoz production, arbitrariness *(administrirovaniye)* developed in the control over kolkhozes. This led to a weakening in the creative initiative of the kolkhoz management. Arbitrary methods eliminated economic motivation ... The production plans of kolkhozes frequently became a mechanical dividing between them (*razverstka*) of delivery obligations passed down from the centre. The organization of kolkhoz production, from the first processes of farm work down to the final delivery of produce to the state, was strictly regulated and centralized.' The Soviet source from which this is quoted is in no doubt that such practices were intimately connected with the very low prices paid.<sup>22</sup> It should be added that, for reasons of accountancy, state farms were, at that period, paid the same low prices, and so required large subsidies from the state budget.

State farms suffered exceedingly at first from 'gigantomania', the belief that enormous 'grain factories' were conducive to efficiency. Thus in 1931 the 'Gigant' state farm had an area of 239,000 hectares! In 1931-2 harvests were unbelievably low, averaging on all state farms a mere 3.6 quintals per hectare, when individual peasants and kolkhozes were managing 7-8 quintals.<sup>23</sup> One reason was their narrow specialization on grain only, another was total neglect of agronomy.

From 1933 state farms, as well as MTS, were supervised by 'political departments'. These survived until March 1940, whereas, as we have seen, the MTS political departments were abolished in 1934. The MTS and kolkhoz sector was left to the raikotn (local party) committee and to organs of the People's Commissariat of Agriculture, while state farms came under a separate Commissariat of state farms (from 1932), and 'the raikomy did not interfere in the affairs of state farms'.<sup>24</sup>

In the period after 1934 many excessively large state farms were divided up, and in some cases land was transferred to kolkhozes. As a result of increased investment and better cultivation yields rose in 1937 and subsequent years somewhat above kolkhoz levels, though without significantly exceeding them. Given that state farms tended to have more equipment and power than kolkhozes, as well as regularly paid wage-earners, their achievements must be regarded as moderate, the more so as their raising of livestock was most unsuccessful.

Despite all these defects, agricultural output did recover from the depths to which it had fallen in 1933.

## **Incomes and Social Services**

### *(a) Peasants*

Since we have been discussing agriculture it seems convenient to begin by surveying the change in peasant incomes.

No complete set of figures exists in any published source, and some of the data that have appeared are not entirely consistent. Cash payments undoubtedly increased, as the following figures show:

|                                   | '933 | '935 | '937 |
|-----------------------------------|------|------|------|
| Per trudoden' (roubles)           | 0.42 | 0.65 | 0.85 |
| Per household per annum (roubles) | 108  | 247  | 376  |

Distribution of grain varied greatly according to the harvest and procurement policies:

|                                       | 1932 | 1933    | 1934 | 193s | 1936  | 1937 |
|---------------------------------------|------|---------|------|------|-------|------|
| Per trudoden'(kilograms)              | 2.3  | 2.9/3.1 | 2.8  | 2.4  | (1.6) | 4.0  |
| Per household per annum<br>(quintals) | 6    | 9.0/9.6 | 9.9  | 9.1  | (6.2) | 17.0 |

*<sup>(</sup>Sources: Sotsialisticheskoe narodnoe khozyaistvo v 1933-40,* **(Moscow, 1963), p. 388; and I. Zelenin,** *Istoricheskie zapiski,* **No. 76, p. 59. Figures differ in the two sources for the year 1933. The 1936 figures are a rough estimate only.)** 

The total number of trudodni worked for the collective increased, hence the total income per household rose faster than the payment per trudoden'. It must be noted that prices of manufactured consumers' goods rose very substantially in the period 1932—7, so that real purchasing power increased relatively little, though the range of goods available at official prices was, of course, much the greater in 1937.

The above are averages. While in 1932 an average of 600 kilograms per household represented a good deal less than a peasant family's normal consumption of bread, even this would

not have represented famine conditions had it been evenly distributed. Yet, as we saw in Chapter 7, famine there certainly was - in some areas. *A fortiori,* 900 kilograms, while not good, was tolerable, and the 1,700 kilograms of 1937 was very satisfactory. But whole provinces were unable to allocate enough bread grains. Even in 1937, the best year of the decade, 28? per cent of all kolkhozes distributed less than 2 kilograms of grain per trudoden', i.e. less than half of the average, and those households were short of bread by spring. Yet the harvests of 1933-6 had been well below those of 1937, that of 1936 being in fact disastrously poor; a high proportion of the peasant families must have been seriously short of bread, under conditions in which other sources of food were few and ordinary baked bread was, for the less favoured peasant, prohibitively expensive. Thus the retail price of bread in 1935 was one rouble per kilogram, which equalled average cash earnings from one day's work (in a typical day, a peasant could earn a little more than one work-day unit).

At this same date one kilogram of vegetable oil cost 1.30 roubles, one kilogram of the cheapest rye flour was 1.60 roubles, wheat flour cost 4.60 roubles, good leather shoes between 466 and 1,000 roubles.<sup>25</sup> This was bad enough. But even as late as 1939, 15,700 kolkhozes (out of a total of about 240,000) gave their members no cash at all for their work, and 46,000 kolkhozes distributed a mere 20 kopeks or less per trudoden'. The Soviet source from which the above figures are taken remarked that low productivity was 'due in the main to the lack of material stimuli, lack of personal interest of the mass of the kolkhoz peasants in their work and in the results of the collective economy'.<sup>26</sup>

Yet the conditions of life of the peasants undoubtedly improved very greatly in the period 1933^7 (except in 1936, when the weather was bad), since their private livestock holdings and their income from sales in the free market rose substantially. But the very large amount of grain available in 1937 proved a flash in the pan. We shall see that it declined sharply in subsequent years.

The rate of migration from country to town declined substantially during the second five-year plan. It may be that this contributed to the marked slowdown, already remarked upon, in

industrial output, especially construction, which became apparent in 1937. It is possible that one reason was that rural conditions of life improved, while overcrowded housing and the low pay of unskilled labour acted as a disincentive to peasants contemplating a move townwards. A further contributory factor may have been the fact that in 1934-7, 1.2 million tractor-drivers and many other 'mechanizers' were trained,<sup>27</sup> thereby providing a rural outlet for the more competent and ambitious village youths.

Technical training for some, better education for most, the almost total elimination of illiteracy; these were significant gains, which ought not to be overlooked. They were greater in the formerly backward areas, such as Central Asia. There were also major improvements in rural health services.

## *(b) Wages, prices, and living standards, urban sector*

We have seen that wages rose by much more than had been planned. Presumably at the time the plan was drafted it had been hoped to reduce costs and to fix retail prices at levels not greatly in excess of the ration prices of 1932-3. We have seen that prices did in fact rise, and in 1934 and 1935 very large increases accompanied the elimination of rationing. This made it essential to increase wage rates of those workers and employees left behind in the course of the wage drift which had already developed in the previous quinquennium and which continued throughout the decade (though at a reduced rate). The government sought so to control wages as to ensure special advantages to priority industries, and we have already noted that piece-rates and bonus schemes, including the high incomes associated with 'Stakhanovism', were designed to provide and dramatize incentives for higher productivity.

Money wages in fact increased as follows:

#### 1932 1933 1934 1935 1937 *(roubles per annum) iA\*7* I.55<sup>6</sup> !.<sup>8</sup> 58 2,269 3,047 *(Source: Trud v SSSR* (1936), and fulfilment report on second five-year plan.)

By 1935 the effect of these wage increases was to cause heavy losses in, and subsidies to, basic industries, whose selling prices were deliberately kept from rising. The following figures illustrate this:

In 1936 substantial increases in factory wholesale prices - coal and steel cost more than double - helped to eliminate most of the losses and subsidies.

A more difficult task is to describe the evolution of retail prices and so of real incomes. The basic problem is the existence of a multiple price system and rationing at the beginning of the period we are describing. In 1933 ration prices were low, 'commercial' prices for the same goods exceedingly high (see p. 207). During 1934 commercial prices were reduced (bread by 31.2 per cent compared with the very high prices of March 1933), but 'normal-fund' prices, for goods rationed or otherwise subject to controlled distribution, were increased. There was a strong case for the speedy liquidation of multiple prices and of rationing. Firstly, the sheer complexity of the system was costly. Secondly, it gave excellent opportunities for speculative resale, and there were many instances of state enterprises illicitly selling or reselling in higher price categories to cover financial deficiencies or just to make money. Finally, labour incentives were ineffective unless goods could be freely bought.

However, given the shortage of goods to buy, unified prices would have to be substantially in excess of the so-called 'normalfund' prices.

So when bread rationing was declared abolished as from 1 January 1935, the price was fixed at 1.00 rouble for the cheapest rye loaf, which was 37 per cent below the existing commercial

price but ioo per cent above the ration price ruling in the second half of 1934, an£l I2j times the 1928 price. After the fairly good harvest of 1935, and following upon the partial recovery of the livestock sector, on 1 October the rationing of meat, fats, fish, sugar, and potatoes was also abandoned, and bread and flour prices were reduced. According to a survey of prices in one industrial town, quoted by Malafeyev, the net effect of the price changes introduced on 1 October 1935 was to reduce prices of bread by 13.4 per cent, of flour and pulses by 106 per cent, of herrings by 21 per cent. By contrast, meat prices rose on average by 101-4 P<sup>e</sup> r cent i butter by 33 per cent, margarine by 50 per cent, potatoes by 39 per cent, these being the reflection of the sharp rise in prices involved in de-rationing.<sup>28</sup> In 1936 milk, dairy produce, salt and vegetable oils were increased in price, continuing the policy adopted in October 1935. Price rises in 1937 affected meat, milk, and potatoes, but the effect on the index of food prices was only 1 per cent.<sup>29</sup> As for manufactured goods, their prices had already been greatly increased by 1933. *De facto* rationing and multiple prices continued, and it was not until the end of 1935 that a series of government decisions narrowed the difference between the levels of commercial prices and those of the 'normal fund'. Though this difference became slight, 'in the period 1936-8 the retail prices for non-food products were not yet in a full sense unified'.<sup>30</sup> Commercial prices were reduced in 1935, but 'normal' prices rose; the exact figures are not available. In 1937 the average price of all non-food items fell by 3.8 per cent. Malafeyev, who used archive materials extensively, has calculated that all state and cooperative prices rose on average from 1932 to 1937 by 110.2 per cent. During this period free-market prices behaved very differently, as the table opposite shows.

It should be noted that the 1932 prices were also very high (see Chapter 8), and also that the free-market turnover was small and only semi-legal in that year. By contrast, there was little difference between official and free prices of most foodstuffs in 1937-

Taking into account the lower market prices, the retail price index as a whole rose, according to Malafeyev, not by 110.2 per

cent but by only 80 per cent in 1932-7. Average wages rose by 113 per cent. Presumably allowing for services, he reaches the conclusion that real wages rose in this period by 'at least 20 per cent'. This surely understates the improvement, because of greater availability of goods and better trading arrangements. In any event, the lowest point in terms of welfare was not in 1932 but in 1933, a year in which both official retail and free-market prices rose very substantially indeed and free-market prices reached their peak. There were also, as we have seen, very large 'official' price increases in 1934, affecting particularly 'normed' or rationed prices of foodstuffs. These increases far outstripped the rise in wages, so any index of purchasing power for these years would look exceptionally unfavourable. This was followed by three very good years for the consumer, and in 1936-7 especially the real-wage index takes a substantial leap forward: in those two years retail prices fell slightly, while wages rose by 30 per cent.

Accepting that in 1937 real wages were, say, 35 per cent higher than in 1935, they were lower than in 1928. Malafeyev clearly implies this; wages rose 4.5 times, official prices 5.3 times. After correcting for prices of services, which rose by less than this, one must conclude that there was a decline. Janet Chapman<sup>31</sup> calculated that real wages in 1937 were 85 per cent of 1928 if 1937 prices were used as weights, but only 58 per cent of the 1928 pattern of consumption. (The Russian emigre experts, Prokopovich and Jasny, had come to similar conclusions earlier, using rougher data.) If 1937 represented perhaps a 35 per cent improvement on 1935, it then follows that 1935 living standards were very grim indeed. Yet, since real living standards depend in the last analysis on the goods and services available, and fewer were

#### **254 fro"<sup>1</sup> Leap Forward to War**

available in 1933 and 1934 than in 1935, life was even harder in those years. Of course, one must also take into account the improvement in social services, the elimination of unemployment, and the undeniable fact that many ex-peasants who moved into industry were earning more than they would have earned had they remained on the farms. Finally, those who had been workers in 1928 had very good opportunities of promotion, and the vast majority of them were probably making a good deal more in 1937 than in 1928. The average is pulled down by the dilution of the urban labour force by unskilled 'immigrants' from the villages. Aggregate consumption went up, because *per capita* measurable consumption by peasants was several times lower than that of the urban population. Urbanization, in all countries, tends to lead to an overstatement, in welfare terms, of the statistical expression of total consumption and also of the total national income.

It is necessary to mention also that availability of housing space in urban areas continued to decline. Stalin seemed more concerned with prestige projects, such as the lavishly decorated Moscow underground railway, than with ordinary housebuilding or the maintenance and repair of existing houses. Conditions in big cities became very difficult, and Moscow was among the worst. The following statistics relate to 'old houses' (i.e. nearly the whole of Moscow) and to the year 1935. They come from the statistical annual *Trud v SSSR* published in 1936 and are unique of their kind. They give figures in terms of 'renters' *(syomshchiki),*  i.e. units which were mostly families but in many cases also single persons. At this date 6 per cent of 'renters' had more than one room, 40 per cent lived in one room, 23.6 per cent occupied a part of a room, 5 per cent lived in kitchens and corridors, 25 per cent in dormitories.

## Trade

Retail trade was a neglected sector. With a general shortage of trained personnel little was available for such a non-priority activity. The number of shops, after the squeezing out of the private trader, increased much too slowly: thus there were 116,000

shops in urban areas in 1932, and only 133,000 in 1937. Queues were sometimes due to lack of retail outlets, but also to poor distribution. Allocation of 'funds' of planned commodities was both centralized and clumsy, with consumer demand largely neglected. 'Particularly unsatisfactory was service to customers.'<sup>32</sup> The psychology of the seller's market went deep.

It will be recalled that during the period of the great leap the word 'trade' acquired a somewhat negative connotation, as there was a recrudescence of illusions about 'commodity exchange' and the withering away of monetary relations. Trade was linked with the food-processing industry, and both were run by Narkomsnab, the People's Commissariat for Supply. It was not until 1934 that it was divided into the People's Commissariats for the Food Industry, as well as for Internal Trade. Under the latter were union-republican commissariats and local trade departments. The transition to unrationed trade at unified prices was carried out by the new Commissariat.

In 1934 retail trade was being conducted by both state and cooperative shops, in town and country. Some of this trade was run by so-called ORSY , 'Departments of workers' supply', set up in 1932; these were shops run by enterprises for their own employees, and such shops continue to exist, with their food supplies often coming from the enterprises' own small farms.

On 29 September 1935 it was decided to concentrate the cooperatives exclusively on trade in rural areas, and state shops (plus ORSY ) supplied the towns. The cooperatives were also responsible for sales to kolkhozes of such items as lorries, building materials, and nails, which the kolkhozes had to purchase at retail prices, which were much higher than those charged for the same goods to state enterprises.

The government intended greatly to improve distribution, especially in rural areas, and retail turnover did increase. However, 'the general level of trade turnover in villages was totally inadequate . . . In many village retail shops there were lacking even goods which were in sufficient supply at wholesalers' stores, including such necessary commodities as salt, matches, kerosene, etc.'<sup>33</sup> Despite this criticism, any picture of life in the period 1933—7 must stress the great improvement which characterized these years.

One effect of the abolition of rationing was the sharp reduction in 'communal feeding', i.e. public catering. In the hard years of the early thirties many urban citizens relied greatly on factory and office canteens, which were supplied with rationed foodstuffs at low prices. In 1935 canteen prices were very greatly increased, and, with the end of rationing, more food could be bought (if one had the money) in the shops. Consequently, the number of meals (or more strictly dishes) served by public catering enterprises fell, from a peak of 11,800 million in 1933, to only 4,200 million in 1937. The fact that this represented an increase in roubles of close on 100 per cent gives one some idea of the magnitude of the price increase.<sup>34</sup>

## Finance

The pattern which developed in the early thirties was maintained with little change. Turnover tax remained by far the largest item of revenue, and this was levied largely but not exclusively on consumers' goods. (Heavy industry paid roughly a tenth of all turnover tax in 1935.) A large proportion of this tax arose out of the wide difference between the low compulsory-procurement prices of farm products and the much higher (and increased) retail prices. The extent of this difference has already been illustrated (p. 210). In 1935 agricultural procurements and the food industry were responsible for nearly 60 per cent of all turnover tax receipts. The rates of tax on most manufactured consumers' goods were exceedingly high at this period. Here are some examples, in which the tax rate represents the percentage of the price *inclusive* of tax (i.e. a tax of, say, 70 per cent means that within a price of 100 roubles there is 70 roubles tax. In Britain this would be expressed in relation to the price before tax, and the rate would then be not 70 per cent but 233 per cent.) Bearing this in mind, the following rates were applicable in 1935: kerosene 90 per cent, nails 28 per cent, light bulbs 10 per cent, galoshes 70 per cent, cotton cloth 35.6 per cent, thread 34 per cent, salt 82.9 per cent, kitchen soap 45-57 per cent, toilet soap 69-72 per cent, vegetable oil 74 per cent, sugar 77.2 per cent in towns, 86.2 per

cent in rural areas, sausage 54.9 per cent. In addition there were a variety of 'budgetary additions' charged at the retail stage: this was 37 per cent for leather shoes sold in towns, no less than 142 per cent in the country. By contrast, producers' goods paid low rates: thus coal, cement, bricks, and steel paid 2 per cent. There were vast numbers of exceptions and local variations.<sup>35</sup> All this was very complex, with a great multiplicity of rates which varied by region and sometimes even by factory, as well as by model or type of product. In 1939-40 the tax system was overhauled. For many multi-product industries, such as textiles, the tax was henceforth calculated as the difference between the wholesale price at which the enterprise sold the given commodity (which was related to production costs) and the retail price (less trade margins). This made for a more logical structure of retail prices, as well as simplifying the tax. One effect of the revision of both prices and tax rates was to increase enterprise profits somewhat at the expense of turnover tax, and the proportion of turnover tax in total budgetary revenue fell from 73.1 per cent in 1937 to 59.3 per cent in 1940, while the state's revenues from profits rose from 8.9 per cent in 1937 to 12.3 per cent of the budget in 1940.

Direct taxation continued to play only a minor role; income tax and local tax ('cultural and housing levy') were at very low rates, the maximum being 3.5 per cent and 3 per cent respectively. These taxes were combined and increased in 1940, so that the tax paid by a prosperous citizen (earning 3,000 roubles a month) by then amounted to 12.46 per cent. The above rates relate to wages and salaries paid by state enterprises and institutions. They were much higher in the case of private earnings; for instance, individual craftsmen were charged a top rate of 52.3 per cent.<sup>36</sup>

Modest taxes on both kolkhozes and collectivized peasants (the latter only in respect of their private activities) were levied in the middle thirties, but their impact, as we shall see, became much more severe during and after the Second World War.

Purchases of bonds became virtually compulsory and most employed persons found themselves in effect contributing two weeks' wages, these being deducted over the whole year. This was a more important source of revenue than direct taxation: in 1938, for instance, out of a total revenue of 127.4 milliard roubles

all direct taxes came to 5 milliards, loan subscriptions to 7.6 milliards.

In the first years of the first plan bond purchases were still regarded as a voluntary act, interest rates were high (8-12 per cent) and the repayment period was short. In 1936 the government converted all bonds previously sold to the citizens to the much lower rate of 4 per cent interest, for twenty years.<sup>37</sup> In fact, .there were few repayments.

Budgetary expenditure increased with the expansion of the economy, the more so as the principle was established, in a government decision of 9 March 1934, that capital investments in state enterprises should be financed by outright non-returnable budgetary grants (except where they were financed out of profits or the depreciation fund). Until the 1936 price reform, subsidies were a serious budgetary burden, and they had to be resumed at the end of the decade as wages and costs rose. Defence expenditures, as had already been shown, rose very rapidly, much more rapidly than had been planned. Since the state budget, on both its revenue and its expenditure side, is very closely connected with the operation of the economy, it followed that the financial and economic plans required revision together. Thus, to take an example, if the planned growth in the output of wool textiles was abandoned in favour of producing guns, then, assuming that investments were simply switched from one to the other, expenditures would remain the same, but revenues would be adversely affected by loss of turnover tax, which would have been paid on the wool textiles; there would also open up a gap between the total income of the citizens and the goods available to them at established prices, since wool textiles are consumers' goods and guns are not. An increase of turnover tax, and so of retail prices, would then simultaneously restore budgetary equilibrium and the balance between supply and demand of consumers' goods. An alternative would be to permit the imbalance to continue, to bridge the gap by increasing the currency issue and to allow the emergence of queues and black-market phenomena. We shall see that in fact this is what happened in 1939-40.

Expenditure on social services increased rapidly during these years. The exact extent of the increases is hard to calculate

because of the impact of price changes. The big educational effort has already been commented upon. Health statistics show a marked improvement; between 1928 and 1940 medical doctors increased from 70,000 to 155,000, the number of hospital beds from 247,000 to 791,000. A large proportion of the newly trained doctors were women. There was also a big rise in spending on social insurance and social security.

## The Last Pre-war Years

(a) *Industry* 

The period 1938-41, until the German attack was launched on 22 June 1941, covers three and a half years of the third five-year plan. This plan, prepared during 1937-8 and adopted formally by the eighteenth party congress in 1939, aimed at impressive increases over the five years: 92 per cent in industrial output, 58 per cent in steel, 129 per cent in machinery and engineering, 63 per cent in wool cloth, and so on. Among other objectives, it was intended to achieve universal secondary education in cities, a minimum of seven-year schooling in the countryside.

But the ever-increasing danger of war led to a drastic recasting of the production programme, which to a large extent explains the shortfalls which developed, particularly in consumers' goods. In addition, as already pointed out, the disorganizing effects of mass arrests were also responsible for failure to carry out plans. Another difficulty was shortage of labour: according to official sources industry, construction, and transport were short of 1.2 million recruits in 1937, 1.3 million in 1938, 1.5 million in 1939.<sup>38</sup> Aggregate industrial output did rise appreciably, by more than was planned, according to official claims. But progress was exceedingly uneven. Thus in the three years 1938-40 the output of machinery and engineering (which include arms) was said to have reached 59 per cent of the total planned for five years, and footwear production even achieved 60 per cent. By contrast, steel output had increased insignificantly, by only 5.8 per cent of the five-year plan increase, rolled metal by a mere 1.4 per cent,

cement by 3.6 per cent, while output of sugar, which should have risen by 40 per cent, declined. Output of oil, a vital and strategic item (one would have thought), expanded exceedingly slowly, contributing to a fuel crisis. It is difficult to find an adequate explanation for this pattern. It is not enough to blame the need for military preparation, for the shortfalls include some commodities of vital importance militarily. It may be, as already suggested, that the effects of the purges and the strain due to the rapid switch into armaments production combined to disorganize the entire planning system. In the case of metallurgy a key problem was shortage of iron ore and coke, and this in turn was due in part to the effect of 'mass repressions' on management.<sup>39</sup> The large number of persons in concentration camps included many highly qualified managers, technicians, officers. One cannot imagine that they were effectively utilized. One must also mention the impact of the Finnish war of 1939-40. This disrupted transport, and in February 1940 many Leningrad factories stopped production owing to the non-arrival of coal.<sup>40</sup>

Despite all errors and waste, the USSR did succeed, in the ten years beginning in 1928, in creating the industrial base for a powerful arms industry. But this base was still too weak to enable the civilian investment and consumers' programmes to survive the effects of a redoubling of arms spending.

The development of the armaments industry, and war preparations generally, will be discussed in the next chapter.

In 1939 the USSR's productive capacity grew significantly by the absorption of new territory: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the eastern provinces of Poland (and in June 1940, also Bessarabia). This must be taken into account in interpreting statistics for 1940. For example, there was a large increase in the number of individual peasants; collectivization in the newly acquired regions was not completed until 1950.

## *(b) Agriculture*

The agricultural policies of the party underwent a change in 1939. The central committee plenum which met in that year decided to reduce the size of private plots. It was found that

many families had 'too much' land, and a total of 2.5 million hectares was taken away from the collectivized peasants. It was hard to imagine a less popular act. In the same year stricter discipline was introduced, with compulsory minima of work-day units per able-bodied peasant. In the same year a decree (of 8 July 1939) instructed kolkhozes greatly to increase their livestock' holdings. Owing to shortage of fodder this led to some fall in the already low productivity of collective livestock: thus both milk yields and average live weight of animals delivered for meat declined after 1938.<sup>41</sup> It had a further consequence: fodder for private livestock became difficult to obtain, and there was a fall in their numbers. Another unpopular act was a marked increase in compulsory delivery quotas for livestock products, levied on both farms and peasant private holdings. Peasants were under pressure to sell for meat (or to their kolkhoz) animals which in many cases they could not feed. There was also an increase in compulsory delivery quotas for many crops, and the basis of the quota was altered from the area sown with that crop (or animals actually owned) to the total arable area. This was used further to screw up the delivery quotas, and the compulsory principle was extended to items hitherto not subject to it, including many vegetables and even sheep's milk cheese. Private livestock ownership fell:

*(Source: Sotsialisticheskoe narodnoe khozyaistvo v ig^-40* (Moscow, 1963), P- 390.)

There was an increase in the rate of payment in kind for the work of the MTS, and a decrease in the proportion of the grain and potato crop sold at the higher over-quota prices, and this too adversely affected kolkhoz incomes. Furthermore, a decree of 1 August 1940 instructed kolkhozes, after fulfilling their delivery

obligations, to set aside seed, food, and fodder reserves, and only thereafter to distribute grain to their members. Although reports on the harvest are now known to have been exaggerated, orders were issued 'to halt the anti-state attempts to understate the harvest yield'. The press reported prison sentences for kolkhoz chairmen who 'understated' the harvest or held up grain deliveries.<sup>42</sup> While total kolkhoz cash revenues rose from 14 milliard roubles in 1937 to 20.7 milliards in 1940, an increase was ordered in the allocation to the 'indivisible' (capital) fund, as well as in taxation, and the average cash distribution per trudoden' (workday unit) rose insignificantly, from 0.85 to 0.92 roubles, certainly less than the increase in prices. Meanwhile the rise in state procurements left much less grain in the villages, and the grain payment per trudoden' fell from the record figure of 4 kilograms in 1937 to only 1.3 kilograms in 1940.<sup>43</sup>

It is evident that, at this period, the peasants had many grievances: less bread, fewer private animals, too little cash, a cutback in the size of their plots. One might suppose that this was no way to ensure loyalty on the eve of war. Of course, higher grain procurements did facilitate the building up of reserves. Incentive schemes were introduced in kolkhozes in 1939-40; these provided bonuses for kolkhoz peasants who carried out plans, but in any case the plans were often set unrealistically high, and the relative decline in cash and, especially, produce available for distribution acted as a counter-incentive. Yields of many crops declined: sugar-beet, flax, sunflower, and potatoes all did worse than before. An exception was cotton, where prices were much more favourable. In 1938-40 yields of this crop were 34 per cent up on 1933-7, ana" almost reached the 1909-13 average, on a very much greater area of irrigated land.<sup>44</sup> Grain yields were a little better but still very modest, averaging 7.7 quintals per hectare in 1938-40, against 7.5 in 1928-32 and 7.1 in 1933^7. Since the area sown with grain increased between 1932 and 1940 by a mere 1 per cent (on comparable territory) the increase was quite insufficient to meet the growing needs of the state and citizens.

A great deal of harm was done at this period by the imposition by the centre of its own pet ideas, regardless of local advice or

circumstances. One such was the so-called *travopolye* crop rotation system, which greatly increased the area under grasses, with the idea that this would increase soil fertility without using fertilizer. In some areas this was nonsense. Another hare-brained scheme was the much publicized introduction of an alleged rubberbearing plant, *kok-sagyz.* Still another was the futile attempt to grow unirrigated cotton in the Ukraine. Lysenko, the pseudoscientist, was beginning to influence official decisions, with promises of instant results at low cost. Agriculture does not lend itself to bureaucratically imposed innovation, and such things led to unnecessary losses.

## *(c) Living standards and trade*

The years 1938-41 were, no doubt unavoidably, a period in which the improvement of living standards came to a halt. Yet the index of real wages showed up well. The reason for this apparent paradox was the price policy followed at this period. Wages rose from 3,047 roubles per annum in 1937 to 4,054 roubles in 1940, or by 35 per cent. Official prices rose by only 19 per cent according to Malafeyev (but by 26-32 per cent according to Janet Chapman). However, free-market prices rose by much more than this, reflecting the increasing shortage of foodstuffs in state shops. Official and even unofficial Soviet figures are few and scattered, but one must agree with Janet Chapman that freemarket prices roughly doubled between 1937 and 1940, while supplies to this market fell. Some Soviet sources imply that freemarket prices were 75 per cent above official prices in 1940. After allowing for higher taxes and bond sales, Chapman arrives at a fall in real wages, between 1937 and 1940, of 10 per cent or so. The fall was most pronounced in 1940. Goods of all kinds were much more difficult to obtain, there were more queues, there was unofficial rationing of foodstuffs, and a resumption of sales at 'commercial prices in special shops'. Retail prices were increased in the course of the year but supply and demand remained well out of equilibrium.

Foreign trade had diminished in volume in the middle thirties, and the substantial reduction in imports of machinery made

possible the emergence of a balance-of-payments surplus, which enabled the Soviet government to repay debts incurred during the first five-year plan period. Trade with Germany fell to a very low level owing to the anti-Soviet attitude of the Nazi regime. In 1939 the outbreak of war cut the USSR off from most of its Western trading partners, but the Nazi—Soviet pact caused a large increase in trade with (and especially exports to) Germany during 1940 (and in fact right up to June 1941). The following figures demonstrate this:

## *(d) Labour and social services*

Returning to domestic affairs, it is necessary to mention very severe measures designed to strengthen labour discipline, including not only absenteeism but also unpunctuality and slackness at work. At first these followed precedent by merely imposing administrative penalties: fines, dismissals, evictions, reduction of social insurance benefits and the like (decree of 28 December 1938). In the same month, labour books were issued to all employed persons, and these, together with the internal passport, were intended to control movement and to keep a check on discipline (it was a form of industrial conduct sheet and performance record). But this was not enough. The decrees of 1940 (26 June, 2 October, 19 October) went very much further. Their essential features were:

(1) The imposition of direction of labour on specialists of many

kinds ('engineers, technicians, foremen, employees, qualified workers').

(2) Compulsory call-up of up to one million young school-leavers for 'labour reserve schools' for training. This was the consequence of the shortfall of trainees, already remarked upon. This in turn was attributed to the rapid growth in the secondary school intake.

(3) The absentee from work was treated as a criminal, subject to criminal law penalties of up to six months' 'forced labour at place of employment' (a kind of hard labour on the job, with up to 25 per cent loss of wages). Sometimes this meant a compulsory shift to another job. Another such offence 'qualified' the offender as a 'flitter', and so for a mandatory jail sentence, if it occurred within the period of the first sentence.

(4) Anyone more than twenty minutes late for work was to be treated as an absentee. This would include returning late from lunch break or going off early. Two such offences, once again, meant prison as a 'flitter'.

(5) No one was to be allowed to leave his or her job without permission. This was only to be granted in special circumstances, some of which were listed (e.g. old age, call-up to the army, move of husband to another town, admission to higher educational establishment, etc.). If anyone disobeyed and left work he would be subject to criminal-law penalties and imprisoned as a 'flitter'. Sentences of four months were quite common.

(6) The working day was lengthened from seven hours to eight hours, the working week from five days out of six to six days out of seven (Sunday was to be the normal day of rest), without additional pay.

This draconian legislation was supposedly introduced on representation from the trade unions! Although in retrospect it seems proper to treat it as due to the imminence of war, it was not justified at the time by such reasoning. It seemed to fit a pattern of thought based on the priority of discipline (and terror). It was the duty of the citizen to work for the common good, and the state knew what the common good was. It would punish anyone who sought to substitute his personal preference for his duty to society. The 1940 decrees were not fully repealed until 1956, although it seems that they fell into disuse in the early fifties.

The impact of these decrees in 1940 can be studied in the legal press. A good summary of the evidence is given by S. Schwarz.<sup>45</sup> Some of this evidence is almost beyond belief, but sceptics have only to read the files of the organ of the Soviet procuracy for the year 1940, from which all the instances cited below are taken.

The idea of punishing workers as criminals in peacetime for offences against labour discipline was so contrary to tradition that a campaign had to be launched against 'criminal inactivity, direct covering-up . .. slowness, liberalism' by the prosecution officers *(prokurory),* many of whom were dismissed and themselves prosecuted.<sup>46</sup> Judges were accused of 'rotten liberalism', reprimanded, dismissed, tried, and sentenced, for not ruthlessly implementing the decree.<sup>47</sup> Managers were punished, sometimes very severely, for 'covering-up' (not reporting) lateness and absenteeism by their staffs, and it was made clear that such 'crimes' were very common; thus sixty managers were put on trial for this offence in the Ukraine within a couple of months of the promulgation of the decree.<sup>48</sup> Doctors were denounced for being too 'liberal' with medical certificates for alleged malingerers.<sup>49</sup> 'Mild' sentences were made more severe by the higher courts on the 'protest' of prokurory. The courts, compelled to deal with cases within five days, were overloaded with work. By decree of 10 August 1940, these trials were to be handled by one judge (without assessors) and with no preliminary investigation *(sledstvie).<sup>50</sup>*

Faced with such pressures, judges and prokurory began to overdo things, as was only to be expected, and managers reported for prosecution cases of absence or lateness which were quite evidently legitimate, even under this decree. Thus one woman teacher was prosecuted while she was actually in a maternity home;<sup>51</sup> a woman with a sick breast-fed baby at home, and five months pregnant was sentenced to four months' imprisonment for leaving work, and this sentence was actually confirmed by the republican supreme court;" another woman with two young children whose baby-minder left was sentenced to two months';<sup>53</sup> still another one was given three months' imprisonment for being absent, after producing a medical certificate proving an attack of malaria,<sup>54</sup> and so on, and so forth. By the end of the year, in cases like these, the chief prokuror in Moscow was intervening to

set aside unjustified sentences. To explain such outrages one must remember that the great purge, with its excesses of terror, was fresh in everyone's mind.

This legislation was only very occasionally linked with the danger of war. In the main, it was presented as logical and right in itself, justified by selected quotations from Lenin and Stalin. This was the time of the Nazi—Soviet pact, and the citizens were being told that the danger of war had receded. These very severe measures seemed to be a bad psychological preparation for the trials to come, when popular support would prove an indispensable source of strength.

Other unpopular measures were taken in 1938-40. Some social insurance benefits were cut: thus maternity leave had been reduced from 112 days to seventy days already in 1938. Full social insurance benefits, under the 1938 'discipline' decree, were paid only to those with a long period of service in the same enterprise. Finally, fees were introduced in 1940 for upper forms of secondary schools and in higher education, despite a provision of the 1936 Constitution guaranteeing free education at all levels for all citizens. (The Constitution was amended, but not until several years later.) This measure, clearly, was linked with the call-up to labour reserve schools: the expansion of academic secondary education was having an adverse effect on recruitment to the ranks of skilled workers.

Thus in the last days of peace the leadership was engaged in retrenchment, strengthening discipline, laying in stocks.

## Planning and Organization

During the thirties there was developed the system sometimes known as the command economy, or the Stalin planning **model,**  based on stern centralization. We have noted its emergence (Chapter 8). It is necessary briefly to sketch in its **further**  development, since, apart from minor changes principally **of**  designation, the system survived for several decades.

Its essential features were the following:

**(1)** State enterprises **(other than those of local interest) were** 

placed under the orders of the appropriate People's Commissariat (Ministry), and the director of each enterprise was subject to orders from his commissariat on all matters. Parts of the economy were under republican or local authorities, but much of their output and activity too was generally allocated and regulated by the centre, directly or indirectly.

(2) Plans had the force of a binding order given by a hierarchical superior. These plan instructions covered such questions as the quantity and assortment of output, purchases of inputs (from whom, and in what quantities), the delivery obligations of the enterprise, prices, wages, staff establishments, costs, and much else besides, depending on the industry in question. Appropriate output plans were devised for enterprises engaged in retail or wholesale trade (value of turnover), transport (ton-kilometres), and so on. Amid all these planned objectives, one was at this period supreme: the gross-output indicator. In cases of conflict between various goals, this was usually the one to which priority was given.

(3) Plans were devised by People's Commissariats for their own enterprises, subject to the authority of the party and government, which laid down the general policy objectives and key targets. The coordinating and advisory body with a key role in the process was Gosplan, the state planning commission, which by the end of the decade was headed by an able young man, N. Voznesensky. It worked out the logical consequences of policies, reconciled them with proposals and representations received from below, and endeavoured to achieve consistency.

(4) Its chief methodological weapon was the system of 'material balances'. For the plan period (in detail for one year, in lesser detail for a five-year plan), Gosplan drew up a balance sheet in quantitative terms: thus, so much steel, or cement, or wool cloth, would be available next year (production, less exports, plus imports, plus or minus changes in stocks). Utilization estimates would then be made. If, as often happened, demand exceeded supply, utilization plans could be cut, or endeavours made to increase supply, and, in a long-term plan, investment decisions would be made to increase productive capacity. Any change in the plan required hundreds, even thousands, of changes in material balances. Thus a decision to make more tanks calls for more steel; more steel requires more iron ore and coking coal, in quantities which can be estimated from technical norms and past experience; these in turn may require more mining operations and transport; but these need more machinery, power, construction, wagons, rails, and to provide them still more steel is needed, and many other things too.

(5) The overriding criterion at all levels was the plan, embodying the economic will of the party and government, and based not on considerations of profit or loss but on politically determined priorities. Therefore in production and investment decisions the role of prices was reduced to a minimum, and rate-of-return considerations were ignored, or confined strictly to choice of means to achieve given ends (e.g. electric as against steam traction), though even in this narrow area they were largely disregarded. Prices were out of line with costs, changed at infrequent intervals and not even conceptually related to scarcities, so the profit motive, had it been allowed, would have operated extremely irrationally.

(6) It is true that under the system of khozraschyot the enterprises had financial autonomy, were encouraged to keep down costs and to make profits. However, this was a means of ensuring economy in the use of resources, and not a way of determining what should be produced, or even how (with what materials) it should be produced, for such things were specified in the plan. Planners could and did take away any of the enterprise's assets without compensation if they so desired.

(7) The breakdown of aggregate material balances and output targets into an operational plan required, in the last analysis, detailed production and delivery plans for every major item of output and input, for every enterprise. The operational plan was made for a year, and for shorter periods. (The five-year plan was not in this sense operational, since it was not an order to anyone to do anything, though investment decisions were derived from it.) The most burdensome task was that of material allocation, i.e. the planned distribution of all important outputs between the enterprises which required them (i.e. *x* tons of sheet steel to plant A from plant B during the third quarter of 1936). For key items,

the task of allocation generally belonged to a branch of Gosplan.<sup>55</sup> For less important items, it was the job of the disposals department of the appropriate People's Commissariat.

The number of People's Commissariats in the economic field grew rapidly. At the end of 1934 all manufacturing and mining was covered by four Commissariats: for heavy industry, light industry, timber and food. The first-named, the largest, was soon found to require further subdivision. This could be done by taking one of the chief departments (glavki) of which the Commissariat was composed and promoting it to ministerial status, placing the task of coordination upon the shoulders of Gosplan and the Economic Council *(Ekonomsovet,* the economic committee of the government). Subdivision went further and further. By 1939 there were no less than twenty-one industrial People's Commissariats, with such designations as Textiles, Munitions, General Machine-building, Coal, Chemicals, Non-ferrous Metallurgy, etc. There was further subdivision in 1940-41.

As already mentioned, there was a close link between the plan and public finance. Since direct taxes were few it could be said that the state ran itself, and paid for defence, investment, subsidies, social services, out of the proceeds of the sale of goods made by its own enterprises. These reached the budget mainly via turnover tax and the bulk of the profits of the enterprises. Investment controls operated in large part via the process of financing them. Decisions on investment priorities could be enforced by requiring specific authorizations from the government for any project costing above a relatively modest sum.

The party maintained a grip on the economy at all levels. Not only did it lay down basic policy priorities, but its plenipotentiaries were repeatedly called upon to take decisions on who was to get or do what, ignoring the formal administrative structure. Appointments and dismissals of planners and senior managers were in practice made by the party's personnel departments. A senior party leader in charge of an economic sector - Kaganovich in transport, Ordzhonikidze in heavy industry, to take two examples from the first half of the decade — issued orders personally on all sorts of matters, great and small. It was said that Ordzhonikidze had a direct telephone line to every factory in his bailiwick, and constantly used it arbitrarily to shift around people, resources, equipment. The party's interference in everyday operations was particularly systematic in agriculture, but was frequent anywhere. Especially after 1936, officials of the NKVD (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, or police) exercised important supervisory functions through the economy, and they also ran a big economic empire using forced labour, until the break-up of this empire after Stalin's death.

In the everyday working of the system much depended on unofficial links between people at all levels, which helped to overcome many deficiencies and gaps in the plan. Sometimes these were illegal; often they made possible the fulfilment of the plan by improvisation of many kinds. The state tried to prevent this by threats of punishment - for instance, for directors who sold off equipment they did not need. Many stories and memoirs tell of sharp practice and breach of rules, without which it was impossible to survive. Penalties beset the managers; there was a decree (of 10 July 1940) making poor quality production a criminal offence. Persistent shortages of goods inevitably led to intrigue and string-pullings designed to persuade the allocation authorities that this or that project or enterprise was deserving of official priority. Of course, anything in which the central committee, and above all Stalin personally, took a direct interest could rely on getting all that it needed. Others had to make do with what was left.

## Growth and Urbanization

During the whole period 1928-40 a large part of Soviet growth was a consequence of the shift of labour out of agriculture to urban industry and construction sites, where, despite all the inefficiencies of the period, their productivity was very much higher. It was higher than it would have been in the village, but of course this labour was quite unaccustomed both to factory conditions and to urban living, and all this created acute sociological problems of adjustment, especially in the overcrowded conditions of the cities.

The two censuses of 1926 and 1939 give some numerical idea of what occurred:

|      | Total population | Urban | Rural<br>(millions) | Per cent urban |
|------|------------------|-------|---------------------|----------------|
| 1926 | '47-0            | 26.3  | 120.7               | '8             |
| 1939 | 170.6*           | 56.1  | 114.4               | 33             |
