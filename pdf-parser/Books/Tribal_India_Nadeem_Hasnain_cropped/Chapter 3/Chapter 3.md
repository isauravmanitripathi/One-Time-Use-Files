DUE to multiplicity of factors and complexity of problems involved, it is not very easy to classify the Indian tribes into different groups. However, the Commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes took up the task and investigated the possibility of adopting classification criteria. Keeping this aim in view the state governments were asked to suggest the characteristics which seemed to them most suitable in distinguishing the so-called "aboriginal" groups from the rest of the population.

THE Assam Government suggested descent from Mongoloid stock. affiliation with Tibeto-Burman linguistic groups and the existence of a social organization of the village clan type as the major characteristics. The erstwhile Bombay government considered residence in forest areas as the basic criterion while for the Madhya Pradesh government tribal origin, speaking tribal language and residence in forest areas, were important criteria. Similarly, the governments of Madras, Orissa, Andhra, Mysore, Travancore, etc., suggested various linguistic, geographical, economic and social factors as indicators

TAKING the above mentioned characteristics into consideration the tribes of India may be classified on the bais of their (a) territorial distribution, (b) linguistic affiliation, (c) physical and racial characteristics, (d) occupation or economy, (e) cultural contact and (f) religious beliefs.

#### **Geographical Classification**

LOOKING at the physical map of India and the distribution of tribal population, we find that both geography as well as tribal demography permit a regional grouping and a zonal classification. B.S. Guha has classified Indian tribes into three zones.

- (i) The north and north-eastern zone
- (ii) The central or the middle zone
- (iii) The southern zone

#### (i) The North and North-Eastern Zone

THE northern and north-eastern zone consists of the sub-Himalayan region and the mountain valleys of the eastern frontiers of India. The tribal people of Assam, Manipur and Tripura may be included in the eastern part of this geographical zone while in the northern part are included the tribals of eastern Kashmir, eastern Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and northern Uttar Pradesh.

SOME of the important tribes living between Assam and Tibet are Aka, Dafla, Miri, Gurung and the Apatanion the west of the Subangiri river. The Mishmi tribes live in the high ranges between the Debong and Lohit rivers. Further east are found the Khamti and the Singpho and beyond them are the different Naga tribes. South of the Naga hills running through the states of Manipur, Tripura and the Chittagong hill tracts live the Kuki, the Lushai, the Khasi and the Garo (now the inhabitants of the newly carved Meghalaya state). In the sub-Himalayan region of the Sikkim and the northern portions of Darjeeling, there are a number of primitive tribes, Lepcha being the best known of them. The Himalayan region of Uttar Pradesh also contains some important tribes like Tharu, Bhoksa, Jounsari (Khasa), Bhotia, Raji, etc.

THE entire geographical zone, though quite large in area, does not contain dense population. As a result of geographical similarities most of the tribes of this zone are engaged in either terrace cultivation or Jhum (shifting) cultivation and are steeped in poverty and economic backwardness.

#### {ii) The Central or the Middle Zone

THIS zone consists of plateaus and mountainous belt between the Indo-Gangetic plain to the north and roughly the Krishna river to the south and this is separated from the north-eastern zone by the gap between the Garo hills and the Rajmahal hills. In this zone, we have another massing of tribal peoples in Madhya Pradesh with extensions in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Bharat, southern Rajasthan, northern Maharashtra, Bihar and Orissa. Northern Rajasthan, southern Maharashtra and Bastar form the peripheral areas of the zone. The important tribes inhabiting this zone are the Savara, Gadaba and Borido of the Ganjam district; the Juang, Kharia, Khond Bhumij and the Bhiya of the Orissa hills. In the plateau of Chotanagpur live Munda, Santhal, Oraon, Ho and Birhor. Further west along Vindhya ranges live the Katkari, Kol and the Bhil, the Gond forms the largest group and occupy what is known as the Vondwan land'. On both

#### 46\_TRIBAL INDIA

sides of the Satpuras and around the Maikal hills are found similar tribes like Koraku, Agaria, Pardhan and Baiga. In the hills of Bastar live some of the most colourful of these tribes like Muria, the Hill Muriya of the Abhujmar hills and Bison-horn Maria of the Indravati valley. Most of the tribes of this zone practise shifting cultivation as means of their livelihood but the Oraon, Santhal, Munda and Gond have learnt plough cultivation as a result of their cultural contact with neighbouring rural populations,

## (iii) The Southern Zone

THIS zone consists of that part of southern India which falls south of the river Krishna stretching from Wynaad to Cape Camorin. Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Coorg, Travancore, Cochin, Tamil Nadu, etc., are included in this zone. Beginning from the north-east of this zone, the Chenchu occupy the area of the Nallaimallais hills across the Krishna and into the erstwhile Hyderabad state. Along the Western Ghats from the Loraga of South Kanara, the Yeruva and the Toda live on the lower slopes of Cooi^ hills while the Irula, Paniyan and the Kurumba inhabit Wynaad area. The most primitive of Indian aboriginals such as Kadar, Kanikkar, Malvadan, Malakuravan, etc., inhabit the dense forest along the ranges of Cochin and Travancore. They are also included among some of the most economically backward communities of the world. Except Toda, Badaga and Kota who live in Nilgiri hills most of the tribal groups of this zone depend upon hunting and fishing for food gathering.

ALTHOUGH Guha has not included the inhabitants of Andaman and Nicobar islands in any of these zones and has skipped their description, yet these tribal people may be said to constitute a fourth zone. The main tribes living in this zone are the Jarwa, Onge, North Senlinelese, Andamanese and Nicobari. Thus separated from the main body of India's primitive tribes, they are ethnically close to the south Indian tribes.

## Linguistic Classification

AT PRESENT people of India may be divided into four speech families viz. the Indo-European (Aryan), the Dravidian, the Austric (Kolar Munda) and the Tibeto-Chinese (Sino-Tibetan), D. N. Majumdar (1955) opines that "so far as the tribal people are concerned the Aryan speech comes into the picture only as a consequence of cultural contact since almost all of our tribal people have pre-Aryan or non-Aryan racial affinities and origins." Most of the scholars, therefore, are of the view that the tribal people of India

may be classified chiefly into three speech families: (1) Dravidian, (2) Austric, and (3) Tibeto-Chinese.

THE tribal people speaking the language falling under Dravidian v, speech family inhabit the middle and southern India. The most developed languages of Dravidian family are Tamil, Telegu, Kannada and Malayalam. Gonds occupy the chief place among the tribal speeches derived from Dravidian family and it is spoken widely by the Gond tribals who are scattered from Madhya Pradesh to Andhra Pradesh. It has no literature but considering the numerical strength of its speakers, it has been assigned a veiy important place in the realm of tribal languages. Another important language of this group is Koi which is spoken by the Kandh of Orissa, Oraon of Chotanagpur and Malto of Rajmahal hills. The speeches of Toda, Paliya, Chenchu, Irula and Kadar are also included in the Dravidian family.

THE Austric family of speeches is also know as Munda speech family. Max Muller was the first scholar who distinguished it from Dravidian speech and it is he who assinged the term Munda speech family to this group. Speeches of this family are spoken mainly by the tribals of Chotanagapur area but these are also in vogue, to a lesser extent, in some parts of Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal, Madras and Terai region of Himalayas stretching from Bihar to Simla hills. The Santhali speech of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, Mundari, Ho Kharia, Bhumij and some other speeches of Bihar also included in this family. are

TIBETO-CHINESE speeches are spoken most by the tribals of Mongol racial stock. This family is divided into two branches (i) Tibeto-Burman, and (ii) Siamese-Chinese. The tribals of Assam, Meghalaya and other parts of the north-east India speak one or the other speech of this family.

## Ethnic / Racial Classification

D. N. MAJUMDAR (1955) has veiy rightly described the complexity of the problem of classifying the tribal people of India on the basis of racial affinities when he says that fixing the racial origins or affinities of the tribal communities of India is one of the most complicated tasks that has had to be faced by the Indian anthropologists. There is practically no direct evidence of those ethnic stocks who inhabited different parts of India in prehistoric times. The available knowledge about the racial composition of India in historic times is equally scanty. Therefore, all historical

48\_TRIBAL INDIA

reconstructions regarding the racial history of India have to be based on conjecture.

THE first scientific racial classification of India was attempted by Sir Herbert Risely. He published his findings in 1915 in the book The Peoples of India. He classifies the entire Indian population into seven racial types:

- (0 Turko-Iranian,
- (ii) Indo-Aryan,
- (Hi) Scytho-Dravidian,
- (iv) Aryo-Dravidian,
- (v) Mongolo-Dravidian,
- (vi) Monogoloid
- (vi) Dravidian.

THESE seven types may be reduced to three basic types viz., the Dravidian, the Mongolian and the Indo-Aryan. Significantly, he gave separate classificatory scheme for the 'aboriginals' of India. no

THE latest attempts at racial classification of Indian people are those made by 'Hutton, Guha and Majumdar. Guha lists six main races, with nine sub-types:

- 1. The Negrito
- 2. The Proto-Australoid
- 3. The Mongoloid:
  - (i) Palaeo-Mongoloids
    - (a) long headed
    - (b) broad headed
  - (ii) Tibeto-Mongoloids
- 4. The Mediterranean
  - (0 Paaelo-Mediterranean
  - (ii) Mediterranean
  - (Hi) Oriental type
- 5. The Werstem Brachycephals
  - (i) Alpinoid
  - (ii) Dinaric
  - (Hi) Armenoid
- 6. The Nordic

THE ancestry of the present tribal population of India is traced chiefly to the first three types : Negrito, Proto-Australoid and Mongoloid.

THE tribals of the hills of Cochin and Travancore such as Kadar, Irula, Paliyar, etc., Angami Naga of Assam and the tribals of Rajmahal hills of eastern Bihar are included in Negrito racial type which exhibits short stature, black skin colour, black woolly hair, thin lips and broad nose.

THE Proto-Australoid racial type exhibits short to medium stature, long and high head, broad and small face and small flattened nose. Most of the middle or central Indian tribals come within this racial type but some south Indian tribes like Chenchu, Bhill, etc., also exhibit the racial characteristics of this type.

AS FAR as the Mongoloid racial stock is concerned, most of the tribes of north-east India are included in this racial type and exhibit yellowish skin colour, straight and dark hair, flat nose, prominent cheek bones and almond shaped eyes with epicanthic fold. The Naga, Chakma, Lepcha, etc., are some of the important tribes of this racial group.

DESPITE the above mentioned scheme of racial classification, racially the tribes of India cannot be put strictly under any particular type or category, India having been the "melting pot of races" (Majumdar ibid). The generalized types, referred to above, do not account for ail the tribes. Thus, the Todas of Nilgiri Hills, for just an example, are without a racial label as yet. Serological and linguistic researches are being conducted but these have yet to reveal any new aspect of the racial composition of tribal India.

### Economic Classification

THE classical classification of Adam Smith and the more recent classifications of Thumwald and Herskovits have been applied throughout the world in classifying tribes on the basis of their economic life. The scheme presented by Thumwald is taken as most acceptable in the Indian context and is as follows:

- 1. Homogeneous communities of men as hunters and trappers, the Kadar, the Chenchu, the Kharia, and the Korwa are some of the Indian tribes falling into this category. women as collectors
- 2. Homogeneous communities of hunters, trappers and agriculturists —the Kamar, the Baiga and the Birhor are examples of this type from tribal India.

- 50\_TRIBAL INDIA
  - 3. Graded society ofhunters, trappers, agriculturists and artisans - most of the Indian tribes fall under this category. The Cherc and the Agariya, among so may others, are famous artisans.
  - 4. The herdsmen— the Toda and some sections of the great Bhil tribe furnish classic examples in India.
  - 5. Homogeneous hunters and herdsmen this category is not represented among Indian tribes. The Todas do not hunt, nor do they catch fish or birds.
  - 6. Ethnically stratified cattle breeders and traders the Bhotiyas of the sub-Himalayan region of Uttar Pradesh breed yaks and are itinerant traders.
  - '7. Socially graded herdsmen with hunting, agricultural and artisan population.

MAJUMDAR opines that such a classification, though useful, does not help much because the purpose herein, in attempting a classification, is mainly to indicate the nature of economic difficulties experienced by the tribal communities.

TAKING mainly technological achievements into consideration, a more lucid and clear-cut classification on the bais of the conditions of economic life may be attempted as follows.

- I. Tribes hunting in forests.
- 2. Tribes engaged in hilly cultivation (shifting or slash-and bum cultivation).
- 3. Tribes engaged in cultivation on levelled (plain) land.
- 4. Simple artisan tribes.
- 5. Pastoral tribes.
- 6. Tribes living as folk artists.
- 7. Agricultural and non-agricultural labour oriented tribes.
- 8. Tribes engaged in service and trade.

THOSE tribes who live by hunting in forests earn their livelihood through collection of edible roots and fruits, hunting and fishing. This class of tribes is found mostly in southern India. The Chenchu and Chandi of Andhra Pradesh, Kadar, Malapatram and Kurumba from Kerala and Paliyan of Tamil Nadu and Onge, Jarwa, Sentenelese and Nicobarese of Andaman and Nicobar Islands are some of the important tribes living in southern zone. The Raji of Uttar Pradesh, : Hill Garo of Meghalya, Birhor, Korwa and Hill Kharia of Chotanagpur and Juang of Orissa are also some of the notable

examples of this class. Although some groups of these tribes are slowly learning cultivation yet their cultural ethos are still basically of a hunting-gathering type.

A VAST chunk of Indian tribes is engaged in shifting cultivation on hilly or mountainous tracts of north-eastern and central India. This mode of cultivation is different from the conventional settled cultivation. Under this system bushes and trees are slashed and burnt. Thereafter seeds are scattered on the ashes and the rest is left to nature. (Details of this mode of cultivation are given in the Chapter on problems of Indian tribes).

ALMC'ST all the tribes of Assam, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Manipur and Tripura produce their crops through this mode of cultivation. Some tribes of Orissa and Gond and Baiga of Madhya Pradesh are also engaged in this mode of cultivation

DUE to intimate contacts with the civilized groups, most of the Indian tribes have taken to settled agriculture on plain land as means of their livelihood. Their technique and mode of cultivation are the same as those of other peasant groups and they also use bullocks, plough and other common implements of agriculture, but most of their land is unirrigated and hence they are often seen to be victims of vagaries of nature. Beside their total dependence on rains, they have to rest content with low and meagre yield because of absence of other agricultural inputs like fertilizers, high yielding varieties of food grains,, pesticides, etc. Among the numerically big tribes Oraon, Munda, Ho and Santhals are successful cultivators.

SOME of the Indian tribes earn their livelihood through cottage industries. They are engaged in basket and mat making, weaving, blacksmith)', etc., and supplement the needs of their neighbouring tribal and non-tribal societies. The Gujjar of Kashmir, and Kinnauri of Himachal Pradesh work on wood. Asur of Bihar and Agariya of Madhya Pradesh are proficient in iron smelting, the Kolam of Maharashtra are traditional mat weavers and the Irula of Tamil Nadu make beautiful mats and baskets on bamboo.

TOTALLY pastoral tribes are few in number but Toda of Nilgiri hills, Gaddi and Bakrawal of Himachal Pradesh, Nageshia of Madhya Pradesh, Maldhan of Gujarat and some other tribes of northern and southern India are notable examples of this class of tribes. It is also worth mentioning that not all the pastoral tribes trade in milk. Some of them rear the cattle like sheep and goat for selling them in the market.

#### 52\_TRIBAL INDIA

ANOTHER class of tribes earn their livelihood by performing dances, acrobatics, snake charming, etc., and hence they may be termed as 'folk artist'. The Nut and Sapera of Uttar Pradesh are good examples of this category. The Mundupptu of Orissa are expert acrobats, the Kota of Tamil Nadu are snake charmers, some groups of Gonds of Madhya Pradesh are tattooers and dancers and some other tribes of eastern India and southern India may also be put in this category.

AMONG the tribes engaged in agricultural labour are those which are traditionally agriculturists but due to their landlessness they work as agricultural labour on others' land. According to a conservative estimate about one-fifth of the total tribal population is engaged in agriculture as wage earners. Non-agricultural tribal labour force includes those tribals who are working in local factories and mines of Bihar, Orissa and Bengal and tea plantations of Assam and neighbouring areas.

A COMPARATIVELY small number of tribal people are engaged in government and semi-government jobs as a result of the application of Constitutional provisions. Among such tribes are those of Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland on the north-eastern fringe of the country and mainly Christian tribals of Chotanagpur.

## Classification According to Culture Contact

INDIAN tribes can also be classified according to their cultural distance from the rural-urban groups. Majumdar (1976) opines that this comparative approach is the most useful in evolving a plan of rehabilitation because it focuses our attention on those problems of tribal India which are the outcome of haphazard contact with, or the isolation of these tribes from the rural-urban groups.

IN THE fifties Varrier Elwin floated a well demarcated classification. He described four type of aboriginals:

- (/) those who are most primitive, lives a joint communal life and cultivate with axes;
- (//) those who, though equally attached to their solitude and ancient traditions, are more individualistic, less occupied with axe cultivation, more used to outside life and generally less simple and honest than the first category:
- (Hi) those, the most numerous, who under external influence are already on the way out by the loss of their tribal culture, religion, and social organization; and
- (iv) the tribes like the Bhil and the Naga who are said to be representatives of the old aristocracy of the country, who

retain much of their original tribal life and who have won the battle of cultural contact.

MAJUMDAR has aptly termed Elwin's classification as a 'crusader's manifesto'. He further maintains that though Elwin's classification helps in presenting the contemporary picture of the culture crisis in tribal India but as a basis for a programme of rehabilitation, it is unacceptable. He moves on to present his own scheme of classification. According to him, the tribal cultures fall into three groups:

- (/) those who are culturally most distant from the rural-urban groups: that is, more or less out of contact:
- (//) those who are under the influence of the culture of ruralurban groups and have developed discomforts and problems consequently:
- (Hi) those who. though in contact with rural-urban groups, have not suffered thereof or have turned the corner and do not suffer any more, though they may have in the past, because they have now got acculturated into rural or urban culture Majumdar disagrees with Elwin that every contact with civilized world brings misety to the tribals He takes the stand that our goal should he to take ahead all these three types of tribal communities and e.stablish. under planned conditions, healthy and creative contacts betw'een (hem and the rural-urban grottps. "

THE Indian Conference of Social Work (1952) appointed a Tribal Welfare Committee that suggested the following classification :

- (/) Tribal communities,
- (//) Semi-tribal communities,
- {Hi) Acculturated tribal communities, and,
- (iv) Totally assimilated tribes

## Classification Based on Religious Beliefs

THE major religions of India have variably influenced various tribal religions and pantheons and only those tribal communities still maintain their native religious beliefs with purity who are leading an almost isolated social existence in dense forests. On the basis of the latest Census data of, the tribes may be classified into followers of following religions:

- (;) Hinduism,
- (//) Christianity.

- (///) Buddhism,
- (/V) Islam
- (v) Jainism,
- (v/) Other religions

AMONG the above mentioned religions, the influence of Hindu religion on the tribes is tremendous and almost 90 percent tribals follow Hindu religion in one form or the other. Those who have embraced Christianity are also quite considerable in number and about six percent are under the 'shadow of the cross' but those following Buddhism, Islam or Jainism are negligible in number. One important point which is to be kept in mind in this context is that even those tribes w ho have embraced any of the above mentioned major religions have not necessarily shed their local tribal beliefs and rituals and many of them are found to be practicing their traditional faith alongwith their acquired faith.

WHEN we view this situation in the geographical perspective we see that barring the tribes inhabiting the islands falling under Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea, most of the tribes of South India alongwith the tribes of western India and central India are more or less Hindu in faith. Christianity has made tremendous headway among most of the tribals of north-eastern India and more than 90 percent of the population of Nagaland and Mizoram follows Christianity. In central India, some major tribes of Chotanagpur also follow Christianity and notable among these are Oraon, Munda and Ho. The tribes following Islam are mostly scattered in Lakshadeep, Himachal Pradesh. West Bengal, Maharashtra and Jammu and Kashmir. Among such tribes about 98 percent of the total tribal population of Lakshadeep, Minicoy and Amindivi Islands are followers of Islam. Buddhsim among Indian tribes is represented mainly by some tribal groups of Arunachal Pradesh. The impact of Buddhism, however, is visible in my other Himalayan and Maharashtrian tribes also.

# GLIMPSES OF SOCIETY AND CULTURE

In a vast country like India there are naturally vast minorities presenting immense problems. But what is disconcerting is the general unawareness-- the vast ignorance-- that people in general show about these minorities...

Majumdar and Madan (1967)
