INDIA has been rightly described as a 'melting pot' of race and tribes. Considering the enormity, magnitude and complexity of the problem, it is really a very difficult task for the prehistorian and anthropologist to arrange the people and cultures of India in the chronological sequence of their appearance on this sub-continent. Fuchs (1973) rightly states that even their subsequent history well up to the Aryan invasion is shrouded in obscurity.

THOUGH stone implements of prehistoric man have been found in various sites dating back to the Lower Palaeolithic period, so far no skeletal finds have been made of these earlier times. And the human fossil finds of later periods are too few and insignificant to enable us to draw any definite conclusion as to the racial history of India in prehistoric times. But it has now become an established fact that the aboriginal tribes in India are, in most cases, survivals from the later prehistoric groups. Some tribes may even have degenerated from a higher technological level due to adverse circumstances.

IT IS now pretty clear that the aborigines of the Indian sub-continent do not form a uniform race. Entering India from various directions and from various regions of Asia, they also belong to different races. It has not yet been possible to arrange the aboriginal tribes of India into definite racial groups. Attempts were made by Risley, Guha, Majumdar, etc., but so far they have not been veiy convincing. Hence, more anthropological research is necessary before racial and cultural history of Indian aboriginal population can be presented in a definite perspective.

THOUGH our knowledge is vague about the origin and subsequent history of the numerous aboriginal tribes of India in the absence of sufficient archaeological and palaeaontological data, yet a story of their glory and decline may be arranged as far as the historic period is concerned. The historical data do shed some light on their life and we start picking up threads of reliable proof instead of clinging to the conjectural schemes of things. This has become possible only due to the invention of script and commencement of written records.

LET US first brief review the rise and fall of Indus valley civilization and advent of Aryans on the Indian soil as background to ascertain

the role of earliest known aboriginal tribes of India. The Indus valley civilization is most probably a genuine gradual growth on Indian soil, not an importation by immigrantforeigners establishing a colony in India. The sudden, almost explosive rise of this civilization and its spontaneous growth may have several causes. One of them was the highly favourable ecological situation of the Indus valley. The great fertility of the soil caused the population to increase rapidly. Though, initially, the population of the Indus valley civilization may have been a uniform race, it did not remain so, for the skeletons found in the cemeteries of the sites show a mixed racial composition. The reasons for its decline and fm il disappearance cannot yet be definitely stated. One cause might have been a disastrous alteration of the course of the Indus river resulting in destructive flooding of settlements and silting of fields. "Since the chronology has been revisdd and the end of the civilization fixed at about 1750 B.C., the old hypothesis has been revised that the Aryan invaders, the early forerunners of the Rigvedic Aiyans-might have destroyed the centres of Harrapan civilization and killed or dispersed its population. The discovery of unburied skeletons on the steps of a building in Mohenjodaro to support such an assumption" (Fuchs, 1973).

THE racial immigration that took place in the last phase of prehistoric times and caused the most profound change in shaping the cultures and history of India was that of the Aiyans, somewhere in the second millennium B.C. When exactly the first Aryans appeared the border of India is still unknown. Prehistoric evidence for the early phase of Aryan immigration and conquest is veiy scanty and some important questions still demand convincing answers. Were the conquered peoples those of the Indus valley civilization? Did they speak Dravidian languages? on

THE Rigvedic period (2000 to 1000 B.C.) witnessed wild ^lyan tribes pouring into the north-western parts of the countiy, fitting not only among themselves but waging a was unto death against non-Aiyan tribes. Indra, the thunder-wielder armed with his bolt, is invoked to shatter the forts of Dasasy cast his dart on Dasyus and increase the Aryan's might and gloiy. He slays both Dasyus and Samyus. Saraswati kills the Parvatas, a hostile tribe who dwelt the banks of the Parushpi; Vishnu conquers in his battles the bulljawed Dasyus and together with Indra destroys Sambara's castles. The Asuras who capfUred an Aiyan sage Dabhiti's city, were defeated by Indra and dispossessed of their booty. K.S. Singh (1996) comments on

that "Indian tribes have not lain 'torpid' on the fringe of civilization but, have responded to 'static and dynamic' rhythms of history. Their role is limited not merely to references to such of them as Saoras, Kinnaras and Kiratas (historical Nagas) in ancient texts; it is part of the process of the fusion of races and cultures in the sub-continent, of the growth if Hinduism and its amorphous mass of myths and legends, magic and religion, traditions and customs. Tribal contents in Indian life may be compared to an ice-berg in an ocean and these can be identified as much as the Aryan or the Dravidian. The erosion of tribal mass, ethnic and cultural, and its absorption in the dominant society is a process working even today." The thread of this story is to be carefully picked through ancient literary texts, archaeological and epigraphic evidence, medieval historical works and British records and documents.

THE process of fusion of Aryan and non-Aryan tribes continued. The later Vedic period (1000 to 600 B.C.) is marked by further working of the twin processes of emerging Hinduism, Aryanisation of the tribals and the tribal isation of the Aryans. The two great epics, the Ramayan and the Mahabharat, whatever their historical value, refer to tribals such as the Sudras, Abhiras, Dravidas, Pulindas and Sabaras or Saoras. Of these '"Sabaras are the most familiar and they are probably the only tribe existing today whose earliest references could be traced to Aittareya Brahman". Sabari, who offered fruits to Rama, has become, in Verrier Elwin's words, "a symbol of the contributions that tribes can and will make to the life of India." Most of the then known tribes claimed to have participated in the Mahabharat and its innumerable episodes. Eklavya, a Bhil, has gone down in legends as an ideal disciple who offered his thumb to Dronacharya. Munda and Naga claimed to have fought on the side of the Kurus against the five brothers. Bhima's son Ghatotkacha who performs prodigies of valour in the war, is bom of his tribal wife, Arjuna marries Chitrangada, Naga princess.

THE Nagas deserve comprehensive study in view of their significant contribution and participation in the Indian mainstream of earliest historical period. The historical or mythical Nagas have been absorbed so completely into the Hindu society that no trace of theirs is left today. Significantly, the Nagas of Nagaland have no relation with their celebrated namesakes. The extent of the Naga influence may be measured by the observance of Nag panchami, the influence of the snake-cult on the Vishnu creed (Vishnu's snake bed) and Shaivism, Naga motifs in sculptures at Mahabalipuram and Rajgriha

and such place names as Takshila, Anant Nag, Nalanda, Nagpur and Chhota Nagpur. The Mahabharat is, in a way, an essentially Nagstory. Buddha converted a few nagas. Naga cult survived in the Kashmir valley and Nag power in central India till second centuiy A.D. The abundance of names with a Naga prefix-Nagdatta, Nagsena, Nagdeva, etc., further testifies to their influence.

DURING the earliest phase of historical period, small tribal pockets were subjugated by invaders or indigenous imperial power, Ajatshatru destroyed the tribal republic of Vaisali. Alexander wiped out tribal pockets on the north-western border. The Arthasastra refer to Atvikas who are looked upon as potential trouble shooters. Asoka threatens north-western tribes with dire consequences if they rise in revolt, while assuring forest tribes, in his dominion, of his compassion.

SHARMA (1961) dwells at length about the social structure of this period. He states the Dhamasutra (600 to 300 BC) and the Manusmriti (200 BC to 200 AD) continued the old process of fusion and assimilation. The concept of mixed castes is only a fanciful and convenient Brahminical way of explaining this trend. These called mixed castes were the supposed progeny of male of begotten on the woman of another caste. A few of these, probably Brahmanised tribes, labelled as mixed castes were Nishadas who lost during this period their earlier position and lived by hunting; Medas, Andhras, Madgas and Chenchus hunted wild animals; Ksahlas and Pukkasas who caught animals and birds; Ayogavas worked in wood; Dhigvana and Karauras in leather; Pandusopake in cane; Margavas were boatmen; Veras played on drums and Sarendhas acted as servants and skilled dressers. The Chandalas, a tribe, were absorbed in Hindu society and assigned the task of removing dead bodies of animals and human beings as also whipping and chopping off the limbs of criminals. Thus, the process of downgrading of tribals continued. soone

THAT the tribes were not leading an isolated and alienated existence is borne out by the fact that many of them participated in the sub-Puranic and epic traditions of myths and folk lores. The impact of epic heroes like Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, Ravana, Bhima, etc., on some of the tribes in central India is evident from their treasures of myths and lores. Gonds call themselves children of Ravana. f^anu is another Puranic figure who has deeply exercised the tribes, and Mundas call themselves Manoako after him.

ANCIENT Sanskrit literature is replete with their descriptions. Panchatantra and Kathasarit Sagar present them in a romantic and

friendly perspective. Vishnu Puran describes them as "dwarfish with flat nose." In Kadmbari and Harsha-Charita, Bana presented detailed description of the Saora chief.

THE feudal period (400-1000 AD) saw a greater opening of tribal areas and Hinduisation of tribal chiefs. The Brahmin priests prepared suitable puranic geneologies for them and the ruling Brahmin class spearheaded the process of Sanskritisation or Brahminisation of tribals. Subsequently in the wake of Muslim invasion in the 11th and 12th centuries, there followed the influx of Rajputs (who did not submit) into the tribal areas and the destruction of tribal pockets. Thus, Parmar Rajputs expelled Cheros from Shahabad and the Chandels replaced Bhuinya in South Monghyr district of Bihar.

THE Muslim rule (12th to 18th century) witnessed a new phenomenon the Turko-Afghan and Mughal rulers mostly secured a formal allegiance of tribal chiefs or of Hindu rulers in tribal of Central India and Bihar. In 1585 and 1616 A.D., Muslim armies marched into Chotanagpur and subjugated the Raja of Khukra. Similarly, the tribal areas of Assam were also subjugated by another Muslim General. mere areas

ONE Daud Khan subjugated the Cheros of Palamau around 1661 A.D. During this period the conversion of tribals in the north-west frontier region to Islam took place. Some Muslim saints worked and preached on the fringes of tribal areas, like Pir Syed Shah Kamal who worked among the Nats and Pir Syed Mohammed who worked among the Kols.

SOME streams of Hinduism like Bhakti movement also affected the tribals such as Munda, Oraon, etc. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu passed through Jharkhand and Vaishnava preachers like Binand Das working in Munda area converted many tribals. The Bhuinyas were completely Hinduised and lost all their tribal traits. "The roots of subsequent Bhagat movements among the tribals could be traced to the Vaishnava influence. Nothing illustrates more eloquently than the conversion of the Ahoms in Assam" (K.S. Singh, 1964).

NOW appear the British colonialists with their modern technology, new approach and vested interests. The advent of British rule meant opening up of tribal areas along the sea coast and in Bihar and Bengal. The construction of Grand Trunk Road through tribal pockets accelerated the influx of aliens such as merchants, moneylenders and land grabbers. Furthermore, the pressure of growing population

and the ruthless exploitation and oppression by Zamindars facilitated migration of peasants and artisans to inaccessible tribal areas. The Christian missions also got their pound of flesh.

THE monumental endurance and patience of the tribals exhausted in the wake of the breakdown of tribal order in tribal areas in the 18th century, Munda uprising {1789-1901), the Santhal insurrection (1855-56), the Bhil rebellion (1879-80), Bastar uprising (1910-11) and Gond rebellion (1940) are some of the examples of the awakening among the tribals of India. new

ANOTHER very significant point to be noted in this historical journey of the Indian tribals is the status of the three major religions of India. While Hinduism and Islam had stopped short at the fringes (in most of the cases). Christianity penetrated deep into the tribal areas under the patronage of British rulers. This led to revitalisation movements among the tribals like Kherwar movement (1871-80), Sardari movement (1881-95), Birsa movement (1895-1901), Tana Bhagat movement (1920-35), and a host of others. The agrariancum-cultural movement threw up politico-religious leaders of stature who deeply influenced the tribals' thinking for decades to come.

WITH the departure of British colonialists and rise of independent India, the tribal citizens of the country were promised a fair deal-in some case privileged to become partners in progress. Upliftment of the tribals was an article of faith for our Constitution makers. Could we realise this dream? The coming chapters shall be reviewing the tribal situation in a multi-dimensional perspective to find the answer.
