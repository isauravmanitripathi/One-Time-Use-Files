# PLANS, PROGRAMMES AND THEIR IMPLEMENTATION

# **Chapter 28**

![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg)

THE Indian Constitution enjoins on the State the responsibility to promote, with special care, the educational and economic interests of the scheduled tribes, and to protect them from social injustice and from all forms of exploitation. Their development is a special responsibility of the President; the Governors are responsible for reviewing the administration and development of tribal areas and for reporting to the president.

THE problems of development of tribal areas is primarily linked with the backwardness of these areas, poverty of the people and the concept of integration of tribals with the rest of the population. For promoting the welfare of scheduled tribes and for raising the level of administration of scheduled and tribal areas to the State level. Article 275 of the Constitution provides for grants-in-aid from\* Consolidated Fund of India to states for implementation of developmental programmes. Also, special funds have been provided in each plan for welfare of scheduled tribes in the sector of welfare of backward classes. The assumption behind such an arrangement is that these funds will be additive to general developmental outlays which will accrue to the tribal people and areas.

APART from concentration of population of tribes in different states, individual tribes and subtribes vary from bare handful to several lakhs. They subsist on a variety of economic activities, belong to several ethnic stocks and speak a laige number of languages and dialects. They are also at different levels of political, economic and educational development. According to the Report of the Task Force on Development of Tribal Areas (1975), handicaps of tribal people in different zones in the countiy may be summed up as follows :

- (i) Northern zone stretching from. Ladakh in north-east to Tarai region of Uttar Pradesh has tribes who have been neglected by the authorities since British days, mostly due to remoteness of their habitat and difficult climatic conditions. It is only since the Chinese invasion that along the Himalayan mountains, attention has been drawn to their plight.
- (ii) In the eastern, central and western zones, comprising of States of West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar

Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, problems of tribal development are related to pressure of population of land, problem of land tenure, indebtedness and rights of tribals in forests and practice of shifting cultivation coupled with lower production level THbals of this area suffer from chronic scarcity of food, water and employment. Added to these, is the problem ofModernization due to growth of industrial complexes in the heart of tribal areas which has disrupted the traditional style of life. This has also led to group tensions due to large scale population movement which industrialisation entails compounded by resettlement of refugees from erstwhile East Pakistan among the tribal people especially in Dandakaranya

- (iv) Problems of southern zone tribes are mostly based on their primitive economy of Podu culture (shifting cultivation), food gathering habits and prevalence of Muttadari system of land tenure. or
- (v) Tribals living in the Islands of Andaman and Nicobar, Lakshwa-deep and Minicoy have their problems arising out of their subsistence economy based on fishing and cultivation ' of coconut.

IN SPITE of differences in problems between different zones are a few common features of tribal economic and social life which merit consideration in formulating development programmes in tribal areas. Some of these common features may be listed as given below :

- (i) their habitats are in isolated and difficult terrains with primitive transport system and roads, bridges, culverts, etc., are still scarce and do not link the tribal villages even to the nearest market available or the ' block headquarters;
- (ii) Agriculture and collection of forest produce together contribute major portion of the income of tribals;
- (iii) barter system of services and commodities still exists in tribal areas, the market remains unorganized and commodities loans predominate, making it easier for moneylenders to operate:
- (iv) tribals spend large amounts of their income on social and religious ceremonies, as a result ofwhich they are perpetually indebted to the moneylenders:
- (v) tribals still depend on natural growth of crops with a view to achieve self-sufficiency and lack motivation for making profits:

(vi) their low rate of literacy makes them vulnerable to the unscrupulous personnel in the bureaucracy or forest contractors.

## Planned and Systematic Development

THE advent of independence saw a plethora of governmental programmes launched by various official and non-offical agencies for the welfare and development of the tribal people. But the first systematic effort for the development of tribal areas was initiated in 1955 in the form of Special Multipurpose Tribal Development Blocks. A modified version of this programme was taken up on a larger scale during the Second Five Year Plan when the tribal development blocks were started. This programme was further expanded during the Third Five Year Plan and all areas with more than two-third tribal concentration were covered by the end of this period. About 38 per cent of the total tribal population of the country spread over 504 tribal development blocks was covered. Although, it was agreed in principle to extent the programme to all those areas which had more than 50 percent tribal population, it is not possible to do so during the Fourth Plan. The developmental effort in then existing tribal development blocks was consolidated by extending the period of their operation. The area coverage, therefore, remained practically unchanged upon the end of the Fourth Plan. In the meantime, this programme was reviewed on a number of occasions, notably by a study team appointed by the Planning Commission under the Chairmanship of Shilu Ao. It was felt that the tribal development block was too small a unit for planning and execution of long-term developmental programmes. It was also found that the developmental effort from the general sector programmes was not adequate in those areas, particularly in the context of their comparatively lower economic base. It was, therefore, decided to evolve a new strategy for the development of tribal areas.

AS A follow-up action, the Planning Commission appointed a Task Force on Development of Backward Classes which considered the problem in its numerous facets. The Task Force appointed a number of working groups, notably the one on personnel policies. The Task Force suggested a three-tier developmental structure at micro, meso and macro levels. The meso unit was suggested to be the main building block of this strategy. Area development and tribal development were to be suitably intermeshed in an integrated developmental programme. The strategy becomes clearer in the report

of the Task Force and the various aspects needing special attention came into greater focus. [The strategy clearly spells out the problem of tribal development into two parts: (a) that of areas having more then 50% tribal concentration and the scheduled areas; and (b) that of areas with dispersed tribal population. Besides these two broad categories, primitive tribal communities at pre-agricultural level of technology were identified as a special group.]

THE strategy for areas of tribal concentration culminated in the concept of a Sub-Plan for these areas. For this purpose the State and Union Territories have been grouped into three categories viz.:

- (i) States and Union Territories having more than 50% tribal population: Meghalaya, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Dadra and Nagar Heveli and Lakshdeep, Minicoy and Amindivi Islands fall under this category,
- (ii) States and Union Territories having large tribal population: Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Orissa, Rajasthan and TYipura come under this category.
- (iii) States and Union Territories having scattered tribal population: Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Goa, Daman and Dieu.

THE state plans of StatesAJnion Territories in category (i) are really tribal development plans and, therefore, no Sub-Plan has been considered necessary in their case. The Planning Commission requested other states, with some exceptions, to prepare Sub-Plans. A very broad frame of reference has been provided for the Sub-Plan in the note of the Planning Commission. The Sub-Plans are expected to: (i) identify the resources, for the sub-plan areas; (ii) prepare a broad policy frame for the development of tribal areas; and (iii) define a suitable administrative strategy for its implementation, [The Sub-Plan area in each State is to be divided into viable project areas, taking into consideration administrative boundaries, topography, level of economic development, ethnic composition, natural resources and potentials for development.] For each of the units so defined, an 'integrated tribal development project\* with reference to the problems of that area is to be formulated within the policy frame provided by the Sub-Plan. The most important feature in the new strategy is that it recognises that there is no uniform solution to the variety of

problems facing the tribal areas and communities which are at different levels of socio-economic development. However, certain common features also cannot be missed which will need immediate attention, though solutions will depend on the local situation. Elimination of exploitation is highest on the agenda. The integrated tribal development project will be a continuous effort for understanding the local situation, evolving suitable programmes, their effective implementation and a constant appraisal of the results on the "- touch-stone of their impact on the well-being of the most deprived sections of the community.

# Development Programmes in the Plan

THE pattern of central assistance for plan programmes depends on whether these are centrally-sponsored or state plan schemes. In case of centrally-sponsored schemes, states get 100% central assistance and for those in the state plan, central assistance is available as block grants and loans. Classification of centrally-sponsored and state plan schemes is as follows :

# Centrally-Sponsored Schemes

- 1. Tribal development blocks;
- 2. Cooperation;
- 3. Girls' hostels:
- 4. Post-matric scholarship;
- 5. Coaching and pre-examination training schemes for competitive examinations:
- 6. Research, training and special projects;

### State Plan Schemes

**Education :** Pre-matric scholarships, stipends, boarding grants, hostels, supply of free books, stationery, uniforms, mid-day meals, etc.

**Economic Development :** Subsidy for agricultural implements, seeds, fertilizers, etc., cottage industries, rehabilitation, communications, animal husbandry, horticulture, pisciculture, cooperation, minor irrigation, soil conservation.

Health, Housing and Others: Housing, drinking water supply, medical and public health, social and cultural activities, aid to voluntary agencies, and miscellaneous.

# I. Special Multipurpose Tribal Blocks

AS THE first systematic effort for the development of tribal areas. Special Multipurpose Tribal Blocks were initiated in 1955. Forty-three such blocks were opened in different states for the first time in 1956 to speed up the process of development in the areas of the largest tribal concentrations. These blocks were jointly sponsored by the Ministries of Home Affeirs and Community Development. The state governments given charge of implementation of this programme. These blocks differed basically from the normal blocks on the following points: were

- (i) Developmental programmes to be implemented were more intensive in character;
- (ii) The population and area coverage was to be much less than normal blocks;
- (Hi) Peoples ' contribution had to be kept to the minimum and limited only to supply of the unskilled labour at a lower rate;
- (iv) Loan funds were to be diverted as subsidies;
- (v) Personnel appointed for these areas had to be suitably trained

VARIOUS centrally-sponsored as well as state-sponsored schemes, as mentioned earlier, were taken up ^nder these Special Multipurpose Tribal Blocks. However, after sorne time it, was realised that the programmes being undertaken under these blocks were not yielding desired results. In order to pinpoint the lacunae and suggest a better alternative, a committee was constituted under Verrier Elwin to go into various aspects of the programme. The main observations of the Elwin Committee were:

- (a) Though, the programme suffered from the defects of all tension,
- (b) In tribal areas; top priority should be given to agriculture and allied subjects, like irrigation, reclamation and soil conservation,
- (c) There should be really serious attempt to relate the programme and the way of doing things to the tribal background, etc.

NOW a modified version of this programme was taken up on a laiger scale during the Second Five Year Plan when the Tribal Development Blocks were started.

# II. Tribal Development Blocks

IN THE Third Five Year Plan period (1961-66), Tribal Development Blocks came into being, based on the general pattern of Community Development Blocks, but more intensive in character. The object was to bring about rapid improvement in socio-economic standard of the tribals.

THESE blocks were originally chosen with a population of one lakh (one hundred thousand) to become the units of formulation and execution of development programmes. Later on, this was lowered to twenty-five thousand and an area of 200 square miles. Popular representatives were associated with the block's governmental machineiy, so that the programmes could be reflective of the needs and aspiration of the people. Till the end of 1966-67,484 blocks had been set up in various states. Though, no rigid pattern was laid down the guidance prescribed that 60% of funds should be earmarked fo^ economic development programmes, 25% for communications and 15/o for social services. High priority, assigned to communications programme, was in consideration of the difficult terrain and inaccessibility of tribal areas. An assessment of the programme made by the Vidyarthi Task Force indicated that it had fallen short of expectations, though it brought in a change in the outlook of tribals particularly in the field of education and agriculture. The following programmes were planned and implemented according to the priorities prescribed: ^

Schemes for weaning away the tribals from shifting to settled cultivation; Establishment of grain goal for supplying fruit plants, grafts, vegetable seeds and seelings; Agricultural implements, . ^ans and grants for soil conservation, minor irrigation, etc.\* Demonstration farms to introduce improved agriculture practices.

\*re^g\* poultry-keeping and sheep-

Cot^e and SmaU Industries: Various types of cottage and small industnes depending on local availability of raw

Social Education: Promotion of existing village institutions into community centres.

Women Children's Programme: Teaching of health and sanitation through recreational and cultural programmes.

# III. Tribal Sub-Plan and Integrated Tribal Development Project

WITH some changes, the tribal development blocks continued into the Fourth Plan and beyond. These programmes, in practice, became too rigid, although varying conditions demanded different approaches to their problems. The tribal development block area proved to be too small a unit for large investments in infrastructures, economic development and social services. That these blocks could not accommodate schemes like soil conservation, major and medium irrigation, secondary and technical education, etc., is an instance in point.

IN THE Fifth Five Year Plan, attention had to be focussed on the specific problems of each identifiable group and area, so that a definite perspective emerged for the course of their development. Broadly speaking, the situations in regions of tribal concentration and in areas of dispersed tribal population were quite distinct which required different approaches. In the regions of tribal concentration, area development approach had to be adopted, focussing on the problems of the tribal people. Keeping these factors into consideration, the concept of sub-plan was evolved. The sub-plan is not a scheme, it represents a new approach. [The strategy clearly spelt out the problem of tribal development into two parts- (i) that of areas of having more than 50 percent tribal concentration, and the scheduled areas, and (ii) that of areas with dispersed tribal population. Besides these two categories, primitive tribal communities at the pre agriculture level of technology were identified as a special group.]

THE region of tribal concentration, or the sub-plan in each state comprises a number of viable project areas, known as Integrated Tribal Development Projects. For each project an integrated area development programme, focussing attention on the specific problems of the area and people in that region, has to be formulated.

THE long-term objectives of the sub-plan are : (i) to narrow the gap between the levels of development of tribal and other areas; (ii) to improve the quality of life of the tribal communities.

AMONG the immediate objectives are elimination of exploitation in all forms, speeding up the process for social and economic development, building up inner strength of the people and improving their organisational capabilities. In relation to the developmental

programmes, the tribal sub-plans represent the totality of public sector effort in that area. The resources of the sub-plan are:

- (i) State plan outlays;
- (ii) Sectorial outlay in the central ministries;
- (iii) Special central assistance:
- (iv) Institutional finance.

ACCORDING to the note on the preparation of sub-plan issued by the Planning Commission, a general strategy to achieve the objectives has to be evolved in the sub-plan keeping in view the special problems of the tribal region in each state. Some of the elements of this strategy are as follows:

# Prevention of Exploitation

NO DEVELOPMENTAL activity for benefiting the tribal population will succeed unless exploitation in various forms is prevented. Integrated credit-cum-marketing services, covering marketing of agricultural and minor forest produce, supply of inputs and essential consumer commodities, credit for production purposes as also for consumption and social needs etc., have to be set up. Redemption of past debts through legislative and executive measures will have to be taken up. Suitable measures may also be considered for dealing with the resultant liability. Programmes for the prevention of land alienation, restoration of lands already alienated, termination of practices, like bonded-labour, solution of the problems created in the zones of influence of modern industrial areas and review of excise and forest policies get special attention.

# Development of Tribal Economy

TRIBALS, by and laige, depend on agriculture and forests for their livelihood. Hence, development of agriculture is given the highest priority. The most, important components for the development of agriculture are held ownership and its development, provision of irrigation and improved, methods of cultivation. Completion of land records will have to be given a high priority. Shifting cultivators, forest villagers and forest labourers will be getting special attention.

# Generation of Employment Opportunities

THE level of economic activity in tribal areas is very low, yet the potential of their resource endowment is only partially utilised. Opportunities for better utilisation of available manpower have to be

created through programmes of horticulture, animal husbandry, piggery and allied occupations. Cottage industries based on local raw materials have to be developed with a view to maximise the proportion of semi-processed and processed goods in the export-mix of Ae region.

# Provision of Basic infrastructure

FOR speeding up the socio-economic development, basic infrastructure, legal, institutional and physical, are required to be developed on a priority basis. Growth centres, communication network, schools, rural health centres, marketing and credit oiganisations, rural electrification, manpower resources ^d training have to be planned in an integrated fashion, keeping in view the special conditions of the tribal areas.

# Special groups and problems

AS THE sub-plan focuses its attention on the welfare and . development of the people, special attention has to be ^ven to areas and groups facing special problems. These include primitive tribal groups in extremely backward pockets, shilling cultivators and tribals affected by major projects. Those tribal groups, who have not received the benefits of development so far and are more backward amongst the tribal communities themselves, need to be identified. Special assistance is provided for such groups.

PREPARATION of the sub-plan involves - (i) identification and demarcation of areas of tribal concentration; (ii) Identification of socio-cultural barriers and promoters of change and development; (Hi) Assessment of potentialities, special problems and felt needs of the tribal areas; (iv) Assessing the resource availability for the sub-plan; (v) Formation of sectorial programmes; and (vi) Devising a suitable administrative set up.

[THE sub-plan area in each state is to be divided into various project taking into consideration administrative boundaries, topography, level of economic development, ethnic composition, natural resources and potential for development.] areas.

AS THE tribal development block was too small a unit for planning and coordination, it was decided to constitute a project area comprising a group of development blocks. Therefore, the entire tribal sub-plan area has been divided into a number of viable Integrated Tribal Development Projects (ITDP). As the situation varied from state to another and from one area to another in the same state. one

the project size was decided, keeping in view the specific situation m a particular case. The project covers on an average, about three to four lakhs population and about six to seven blocks.

THE project represents the total developmental effort in a particular area and has to accept the problem-solving approach, covering a lame spectrum from protection to welfare. It has been conceived comprising the totality of the existing administrative concerned area. as apparatus in the

# IV. Large Sized Multipurpose Societies

THESE cooperative societies have been set up since 1974 in tribal are^ in the country with a view to supplying under one roof the various requirements of tribal people. Their credit-cum-marketing needs are particularly looked after by these societies. The policy of LAMPS IS sought to be tribal-oriented by having tribals on the board of directors. Adequate share capital is being provided.

- (iv) Aid to voluntary organisations.

THE Shilu Ao Team on Tribal Development Programme (1969) had also expressed the view that the results achieved have not been commensurate with the expenditure incurred, and that much money has been wasted on schemes which have failed largely because of the failure of planners to take into account the stage of development of the tribals for whom they are intended and the conditions obtaining in the areas where they are to be implemented. The resources had been wasted on grandiose schemes of colonisation, housing, cooperation, etc. which had laigely failed and had conferred no tangible benefits on the tribals. Failure of housing schemes is an instance in point. Tiled houses, involving considerable expenditure of public funds, constructed in the midst of forests on stereotyped lines have either remained untenanted or abandoned soon after construction because of the erroneous assumption of the planners that what is good for the people in the plains should be equally good and acceptable to the tribals. What is surprising is not the initial assumption which may have been due to ignorance but the persistence in the error in the face of accumulated experience which had demonstrated time and again that tribals will not 'stay put' in houses which do not conform to their ideas of layout and designs. If housing schemes have failed, colonisation schemes have fared no better. More money has been wasted on these schemes, with their ambitious housing adjuncts, than on any other single welfare activity undertaken for the benefit of the tribals. In one of the more important states which

the Team visited, the failure was so complete that colonisation schemes were completely excluded from the Third Five Year Plan. The waste could have been avoided if planning had been preceded by a socio-economic survey to help the planners with the data concerning the felt needs of the tribals and the conditions obtaining in the regions which they inhabit. Among some other factors responsible for the unsatisfactoiy results of the tribal development programmes are :

- (i) The delay in the implementation of considered recommendations made by the Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes Commission and other high level bodies in the past to protect the rights of the tribab has worsened the position which these recommendations were intended to correct while the failure to pay attention to and profit by their advice on matters pertaining to the formulation and implementation of tribal development programmes had resulted in the failure of ambitious schemes and consequent waste of valuable resources,
- (ii) No conscious attempt has been made by any of the state governments, with the solitary exception of Andhra Pradesh, to ensure that the tribals receive a reasonable share of the benefits from the general development programmes to which they, as citizens of the state, are legitimately entitled. Broadly speaking, the planners in the states have proceeded on the basis that the special provision is the only provision available to finance tribal development programmes.
- (Hi) Development effort instead of correcting the existing imbalance as between tribe and tribe has widened it as the benefits of the schemes undertaken have largely accrued to the more progressive sections amongst them,
- (iv) The tribal development blocks failed to get any significant support from the general development programmes including community development programmes,
- (v) The Schemes formulated for these blocks were not adopted to the felt needs of the specific areas.

THE administrative set up is also, responsible for the unsatisfactory performance of tribal development programmes. When a number of departments, each providing its own particular input and each working more or less independently of the other, come into existence, the tribal people are forced to run from pillar to post to get what they need. The Planning Commission in this connection observed :

Multiplicity of agencies has resulted in diffusion of responsibility, inadequate control, lack of coordination and from the people's angle, difficulty in identifying the officials concerned with specific programmes. The pattern of administrative organization will have to be worked out in detail for achieving functional coordination and efficiency. Delegation of authority, specificity of responsibility and adequate flexibility should be built into the system so as to enable the implementing authority to effect changes in the ongoing programmes on the basis of concurrent evaluation. As a result of historical reasons. the administrative structure in tribal areas has continued to lack simplicity and thereby defying comprehension of the tribals and has failed to evoke substantial response from them. All that polemics, criticism and counter-criticism apart, there is a consensus that position of the tribals has improved, but in the absence of concrete data it is not possible to give a clear verdict on the extent of progress and say if it was appreciable or only marginal. In the light of our laudable objective but' not so good performance, it is evident that the entire question of tribal development needs afresh look.

DR. RAM Dayal Munda, former Vice-Chancellor of Ranchi University and a tribal himself has the unkindest remarks for the government approach towards tribal development. In a frank interview (1988) he hits the nail straight on the head when he says that the "government is pumping money into a leaking system. What use is it anyway? There has been no significant result of these efforts. Land alienation continues unabated, outsiders continue to get -preference in matters of training and employment, even loans. There is no evidence of decentralization. Corruption and favouritism continue to thrive under an alien political culture".

#### **Development of Scheduled Tribes**

THE Ministry of Tribal Affairs was set up in 1999 after the bifurcation of Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment with the objective of providing more focused approach on the integrated socioeconomic development of Scheduled Tribes (STs), the most underprivileged of the Indian Society, in a coordinated and planned manner. Before the formation of the Ministry, tribal affairs were handled by different Ministries as follows:-

1. As a Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs names as 'Tribal Division' since independence up to September, 1985.

- 2. Ministry of Welfare: From September 1985 to May 1998.
- 3. Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment from May 1998 to September 1999.

#### Scheduled Areas and Tribal Areas

SCHEDULED Tribes live in contiguous areas unlike other communities. It is, therefore, much simpler to have an area approach for development activities and also regulatory provisions to protect their interests. In order to protect the interests of Scheduled Tribes with regard to land alienation and other social factors, provisions of the "Fifth Schedule" and "Sixth Schedule" have been enshrined in the Constitution.

The Fifth Schedule under Article 244 (1) of Constitution defined "Scheduled Areas" as such areas as the President may by Order declare to be Scheduled Areas after consultation with the Governor the state. The Sixth Schedule under Article 244(2) of the Constitution relates to those areas in the states of the Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram which are declared as "Tribal Areas" and provides for District Councils and/or Regional Councils for such Areas. These Councils have been conferred with wide ranging legislative, judicial and executive powers. The Fifth Schedule Areas: The criteria for declaring any area as a "Scheduled Area" under the Fifth Schedule are: (a) Preponderance of tribal population, (b) Compactness and reasonable size of the area, (c) A viable administrative entity such district, block or taluk, and (d) Economic backwardness of the compared to neighbouring areas. The specification of "Scheduled Areas" in relation to a State is done by a notified Order of the President, after consultation with the State Governments concerned. The same applies for altering, increasing, decreasing, incorporating new areas, or rescinding any orders relating to "Scheduled Areas". as a area as

THE advantages of Scheduled Areas are that: (a) the Governor of a state, which has Scheduled Areas, is empowered to make regulations in respect of the following: (i) Prohibit or restrict transfer of land from tribal people; (ii) Regulate the business of money lending to the members of Scheduled Tribes. In making any such regulation, the Governor may repeal or amend any Act of Parliament or of the Legislature of the State which is applicable to the area in question, (b) The Governor may be through public notification direct that any particular Act of Parliament or of the Legislature of the State, shall not apply to a Scheduled Areas or any part thereof in the state or

shall apply to such area subject to such exceptions and modifications as he may specify. (c) The Governor of a State having Scheduled Areas therein, shall annually, or whenever so required by the President of India, make a report to the President regarding the administration of the Scheduled Areas in that State and the executive power of the Union shall extend to the giving of directions to the State as to the administration of the said area. (d) Tribes Advisory Council (TAC) shall be established in States having Scheduled Areas. The role of TAC is to advise the State Government on matters pertaining to the welfare and advancement of the Scheduled Tribes in the State as may be referred to it by the Governor. The TAC will consist of not more than twenty members of whom about 3/4 are from ST-MLAs. The TAC may also be established in any State having Scheduled Tribes but not Scheduled Areas on the direction of the President of India (e) The Provisions of the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA), vide which the provisions of Panchayats, contained in Part IX of the Constitution, were extended to Scheduled Areas, also contain special provisions for the benefit of Scheduled Tribes. The Sixth Schedule - Tribal Areas : The Sixth Schedule under Article 244 of the Constitution identifies Autonomous districts in the Tribal Areas in the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram. It also makes provisions for recognition of Autonomous Regions within these Autonomous Districts. These have been specified in Parts I, II, II A, & III of the table appended to paragraph 20 of the Sixth Schedule. In other words, areas where provisions of Sixth Schedule are applicable are known as Tribal Areas. The State-wise details of Tribal Areas are as under:-

#### Part - I Assam

- The North Cachar Hills District 1.
- 2. The Karbi-Anglong District
- The Bodo Land Territorial Area Districts 3.

#### Part - II Meghalaya

- 1. Khasi Hills District
- . 2. Jaintia Hills District
  - 3. The Garo Hills District

#### Part - IIA Tripura

1. Tripura Tribal Areas District

#### Part - III Mizoram

- 1. The Chakma District
- 2. The Mara District
- 3. The Lai District

The District or Regional Councils are empowered to make rule with the approval of the Governor with regard to matters like establishment, construction or management of primary schools, dispensaries, markets, cattle ponds, ferries, fisheries, road transport and waterways in the district. The Autonomous Councils of the North Cachar Hills and Karbi Anglong have been granted additional powers to make laws with respect to other matters like secondary education, agriculture, social security and social insurance, public health and sanitation, minor irrigation etc. The Councils have also been conferred powers under the Civil Procedure Code and Criminal Procedure Code for trial of certain suits and offences, as also the powers of a revenue authority for their area for collection of revenue and taxes and other powers for the regulation and management of natural resources.

#### Procedure for Declaration as ST

THE term Scheduled Tribes is defined in the Constitution of India under Article 366(25) as such tribes or tribal communities or parts of groups within such tribes or tribal communities as are deemed under Article 342 to be Scheduled Tribes for the purposes of this Constitution. Article 342 prescribes the procedure to be followed in the matter of specification of Scheduled Tribes. In terms of Article 342(1), the President may, with respect to any State or Union Territoiy, and where it is a State, after consultation with the Governor thereof, notify tribes or tribal communities or parts thereof as Scheduled Tribes. This confers on the tribe or part of it a constitutional status invoking the safeguards provided for in the Constitution, to these communities, in their respective StateAJTs. Thus, in terms of Article 342(1), only those communities who have been declared as such by the President through an initial public notification will be considered as Scheduled Tribes. Any further amendment in the list is to be done through an Act of Parliament (Article 342(2)). Parliament may by law, include in or exclude from the list of Scheduled Tribes, any tribe or tribal community or parts thereof. The list of Scheduled Tribes is State-specific.

### Scheduling and De-Scheduling of TVibes

THUS, the first specification of Scheduled Tribes in relation to a particular State/ Union Territoiy is by a notified order of the President, after consultation with the State Governments concerned. The above Article also provides for listing of Scheduled Tribes State-wise/UTwise and not on an all-India basis.

THE criteria generally adopted for specification of a community a Scheduled Tribes are: as

- (a) indications of primitive traits;
- (b) distinctive culture;
- (c) shyness of contact with the community at laiger;
- (d) geographical isolation i.e. backwardness.

THESE are not spelt out in the Constitution but have become well established. They take into account the definitions in the 1931 Census, the reports of the first Backward Classes Commission (Kalelkar Committee), 1955, the Advisoiy Committee on Revision of SC/ST lists (Lokur Committee), 1965 and the Joint Committee of Parliament on the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Bill, 1967 (Chanda Committee), 1969. There 700 tribes (with many of them overlapping in more than one State) as notified under Article 342 of the Constitution of India, spread different States and Union Territories of the countiy. It is worth nothing that no community has been specified as a Scheduled Tribe in relation to the States of Haryana and Punjab and the Union Territories of Chandigarh, Delhi and Puducheny. are over over

#### Ascertaining ST Status of Individuals

has been specified in that order in relation to his home State/Union Territory; (g) but he cannot be treated as such in relation to the place of his temporary residence notwithstanding the fact that the name of his tribe has been scheduled in respect of that State where he is temporarily settled, in any Presidential Order; (h) in the case of persons bom after the date of notification of the relevant Presidential Order, the place of residence for the purpose of acquiring Scheduled Tribe status, is the place of permanent abode of their parents at the time of the notification of the Presidential Order under which they claim to belong to such a tribe. This does not apply to the STs of the Lakshadweep Islands for whom there is a requirement of being bom in the UNION TERRITORIES in order to be eligible for ST status.

### Scheduled Tribe claims on migration

- Where a person migrates from the portion of the State in which his/her community is scheduled, to another part of the same State in respect of which his/her community is not scheduled, the person will continue to be deemed to be a member of the Scheduled Tribe, in relation to that State. a)
- Where a person migrates from one State to another he can claim to belong to a Scheduled Tribe only in relation to the State to which he originally belonged and not in respect of the State to which he has migrated. b)

### Scheduled Tribe claims through marriages

THE guiding principle is that no person who is not a Scheduled Tribe by birth will be deemed to be a member of Scheduled Tribe merely because he or she has married a person belonging to a Scheduled Tribe. Similarly, a person who is a member of a Scheduled Tribe will continue to be a member of that Scheduled Tribe, even after his or her marriage with a person who does not belong to a Scheduled Tribe.

#### Issue of Scheduled Tkibe certificates

THE candidates belonging to Scheduled Tribes may get Scheduled Tribe certificates, in the prescribed form, from any one of the following authorities:

Migrants from other States / Union Territories Pereons belonging to a Scheduled Tribe who have migrated from one State to another for the purpose of employment, education etc. experience great difficulty in obtaining ST certificates from the State from which they have migrated. In order to remove this difficulty, it has been decided that the prescribed authority of a State Government / Union Territoiy Administration may issue a Scheduled Tribe certificate to a person who migrated from another state, on the production of the genuine certificate issued to his father / mother by the prescribed authority of the State of the father / mother's origin except where the prescribed authority feels that a detailed enquiry is necessary through the state of origin before issue of the certificate, the certificate will be issued irrespective of whether the tribe in question is scheduled or not in relation to the State / Union Territory to which the person has migrated to Scheduled Tribe claims through marriages.

However, since the needs and problems of Scheduled Tribes and the solutions required were quite different from those of Scheduled Castes, a special approach for tribal development and independent machineiy to safeguard the rights of Scheduled Tribes was considered necessaiy. Accordingly, a separate National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) was set up with effect from 19\* February, 2004 by amending Article 338 and inserting a new Article 338A in the Constitution, through the Constitution (Eighty-ninth Amendment) Act, 2003.
