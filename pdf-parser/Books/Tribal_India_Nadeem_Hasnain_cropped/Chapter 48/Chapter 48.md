# Tribal Areas (Sixth Schedule Areas)

TRIBAL areas generally mean areas having preponderance of tribal population. However, the Constitution of India refers tribal areas within the States of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura & Mizoram, as those areas specified in Parts I, II, IIA & III of the table appended to paragraph 20 of the Sixth Schedule. In other words, areas where provisions of Sixth Schedule are applicable are known as Tribal Areas. In relation to these areas Autonomous District Councils, each having not more than thirty members have been set up. These councils serve as an instrument of self-management and have powers of legislation and administration of justice apart from executive, developmental and financial responsibilities.
