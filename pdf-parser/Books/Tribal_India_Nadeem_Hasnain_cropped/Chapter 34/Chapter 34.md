# General Characteristics of Scheduled Tribes

### Origin of the Term "Scheduled Tribe"

THE need to specify tribes and tribal communities as "Scheduled Tribes'\* arose only after the Constitution of India came into force on January 26, 1950. In the Government of India Act, 1935, a reference was made to the "Backward Tribes" and the Thirteenth Schedule to the Government of India (Provincial Legislative Assemblies) Order, 1936, specified certain tribes as backward in the then provinces of Assam, Bihar, Orissa, Central Provinces and Berar, Madras and Bombay. However, the first serious attempt to list "Primitive Tribes" in the countiy was made during the Census of 1931.

### Specification of Scheduled Tribes

ARTICLE 342 of the Constitution provides that the President may with respect of any State or Union Territoiy specify the tribe or tribal communities or parts or groups within tribes or tribal communities which shall be deemed to be Scheduled Tribes in relation to the State or Union Territory. In pursuance of this provision the President made an order in 1950, called the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950 in relation to the then Part 'A' and Part 'B\* States,. In the following years a similar order was issued in respect of the Part 'C\* States.

#### Revision of List of Scheduled Tribes

Under the Constitution, the Presidential Orders, specifying the Scheduled Tribes, once issued can be varied only by a Law of Parliament. The need for varying the orders first arose when Andhra State was formed in 1953 and again on the creation of the new State of Himachal Pradesh a year later; The implementation of the recommendations of the Backward Classes Commission

necessitated a further revision of these orders in 1956. These orders were revised once again on the creation of the now states of Maharashtra and Gujarat by the Bombay Reorganization Act, 1960. Separate orders were made also for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 1959 and for Dadra and Nagar Haveli in 1962. The re organization of Punjab in 1966 resulted in the transfer of lists of Scheduled Tribes from Punjab to Himachal Pradesh. More recently five tribes in Uttar Pradesh and an equal "number of tribal communities in Goa, Daman and Diu have been declared as Scheduled Tribes under the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) (Uttar Pradesh) order 1967 and the Constitution (Goa, Daman and Diu) Scheduled Tribes Orders, 1968 respectively.

## The Advisory Committee (1965)

THE Constitution has not expressly enunciated the principles or policy which should govern the classification of Tribes and Scheduled Tribes. However, it will be evident from a perusal of the special 'provisions relating to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Constitution that the classification proceeds on the recognition of their all round backwardness which in the case of Scheduled Tribes is mainly due to their habitation in inaccessible areas thus cutting them from the mainstream of development and the consequent need for special measures for their advancement and welfare. Primitiveness and backwardness were the tests applied for specifying a tribe as a Scheduled Tribe in the lists prepared on the Scheduled Tribes in 1950 and 1956. These lists, however, came in for criticism on a number of occasions in Parliament as well as outside on the ground that they lacked consistency and contained several anomalies. Accordingly, in June 1956, an Advisory Committee was set up for advising the Government on the revision of lists of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The Committee, which submitted its report in August 1965, suggested revised lists of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
