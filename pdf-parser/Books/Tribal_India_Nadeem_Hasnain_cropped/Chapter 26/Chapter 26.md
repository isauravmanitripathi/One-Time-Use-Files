THE so-called aborigines had been, even much before independence, a subject of research. They have been painted in different colours by different people. Hence, the general masses in India have been holding and perpetuating somewhat confusing and amazing and some times fantastic myths about this section of the society. Their image of primitive, simple, cheerful and colourful people having exotic dances and music, Ghotul, Rorung and Dhumkuria is based on sev eral myths. Behind these myths lies a bitter reality-heart breaking poverty, ignorance, disease and exploitation. It is heartening to note that a number of honest scholars and researchers refused to be swayed by mere romanticism and have scrupulously portrayed the ugly reality as it is.

### BEFORE 1947

THE British administrators of pre-independence India were probably the first people who tried to grapple seriously with the problem of administering the tribal areas and they had a vested interest in culti vating and perpetuating the above mentioned myths about the tribal people of India. They did everything to ensure that the so-called aborigines, the Scheduled Tribes, remain isolated from the rest of the Indian masses, because, the British imperialists had realised the po tentiality of Indian tribes as explosive force in any national move ment. TTie tribals were isolated and their places of habitation were declared as prohibited area. Thus, the alien rulers and Christian mis sionaries were the only people who had access to the tribal areas in the initial stages.

THE first serious attempt made by the British rulers in India, to deal with the local aborigines, was in connection with the Paharias or Malers of Rajmaha! Hills. The implicit intention behind this begin ning was to deal with 'tribulent' tribes only. Leaders of these tribes were granted Sanad and they were assigned the responsibility of reporting all outbreaks. Ghuiye (1963) writes that those leaders liv ing near the lines of communication were to be paid a fixed sum to prj6tect the mail runners. The payment is described by the compe tent authorities as "a bribe pure and simple as in Musalman days". At the foot of the hills, lands were granted to retired or disabled

soldiers, and thus a ringfence of military minded people was created round the marauding Paharias. Slowly working through the corps that were raised, a court was appointed from among the officers of the corps for purpose of justice. Encouraged by its utility, the government was approached to withdraw the Rajmahal Hill tract from the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts. Thus in 1782, this tribal tract was withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and the heriditary leaders of the tribe were called into a sessions courts which was to meet twice a year and try all offences. The council came to be known as' Hill Assembly and it had the power to inflict or rescind even capital punishment.

HAVING achieved the objective of internal justice and peace through the creation of the Hill Assembly; Cleveland, the clever administrator tried to solve another important problem, the problem of encroachments by the hated "foreigners". The lands held by the Paharias were "formed into government estate, held by them direct from Government and free from rent. These measures induced those Pahariya Chiefs, who had still held out, to join in and accept the rule of the British, which for all practical purposes was their own rule. The whole tract, thus unified and specially treated, came to be known as Daman-e-koh" (Ghurye, 1963). In this way the turbulent and problematic Paharias or Malers were pacified and the rules were made Law as Regulation I of 1796. With the passage of time, the prestige of Hill Assembly dwindled and the Regulation I of 1796 was repealed by Regulation I of 1827.

AT THIS stage some other tribal groups, graoning under the yoke of exploitation, rebelled. In this context such uprisings as Ho mutiny of Singbhum in 1831, Khond uprising of 1846 and famous Santhal rebellion of 1855 are worth mentioning. The British Indian Government was also forced to send punitive expeditions to Assam, Nagaland and Jaintia Hills between 1850 and 1890 and repeatedly to the Lushai Hills, Naga Hills and to the Abor during the last decade of the 19th century and the first decade of 20th century.

THE underlying causes of these uprisings and disturbances were almost always the same: the deep resentment and dissatisfaction created as a result of exploitation by their technologically and culturally more advanced neighbours.

AT THIS stage the idea that "distinct and special arrangements were necessary for isolated tribal regions gained acceptance. The findings of anthropological researches seemed to support it" (Report of the Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes Commission, Vol. I., 1960-

61). The British Government finally decided on a policy of segre gating the tribes into special areas where their lives and interests could, supposedly, be adequately protected. Keeping this purpose in mind, an Act was passed in 1874 to specify tribal areas into. Sched uled Districts\*. These areas were reconstituted under Section 52A of the Government of India Act of 1919. This Act provided for the appointment of officers to administer civil and criminal justice, to superintend the settlement and collection of public revenues and all matters relating to rent, and otherwise to conduct the adminis tration within the Scheduled Districts. It also provided for the tension, by notification to the Scheduled Districts, laws in force in any part of British India, with such special restrictions and modi fications as were deemed fit. Thus, wide powers of legislation by simple executive order were vested in the Executive. With the free dom movement gaining momentum, there was increasing anxiety on the part of the British administration to isolate the tribes from the national mainstream. The Indian Statutory Commission (Simon Commission) suggested that on financial and constitutional grounds the responsibility for the tribal tracts should be entrusted to the centre. In the subsequent years and upto 1947 numerous Acts and Regulations were promulgated and various reforms introduced. Thus in 1935, more stringent provisions for a special treatment of the tribal areas were in-corporated by converting them into "To tally and Partially Excluded Areas". ex-

#### AFTER 1947

WITH the dawn of independence, the nation witnessed a consider able awakening about the welfare of the tribal people, TTiis was re flected in various provisions of the Constitution independent India adopted by the Constituent Assembly on January 26, 1950. It visualised a policy of progressive assimilation of the tribal people in the national mainstream. In order to promote the integration of the tribal people with the rest of their Indian brethren, the Constitution provided special safeguards for the tribal communities for a period of ten years. This period continues to be extended till now.

A TRIBAL welfare department was instituted in 1951 for the pro tection and advancement of the Scheduled Tribes and with the help of various provisions of the Constitution, a new line of administra tion was chalked out. Article 244 of the Constitution provides for the administration of "Scheduled Areas" in accordance with the Fifth Schedule and (in Assam) "Tribal Areas" under Sixth Schedule.

THE Schedule Areas, thus defined, are administered as part of the stated in which they are situated but the Governor is given powers: (a) to modify Central and State laws in their application to them; (b) to frame regulations for their peace and good government and in particular for the protection of rights of tribals in land, the allotment of waste land and their protection from moneylenders. In the fram ing of the regulations the Governor is required to consult the THbes Advisory Council in the state. The governor is further required to submit to the President of India an annual report or a report at such intervals as may be required by the Union Government. Thus in the Constitution ample provisions exist to protect the rights of the tribals in land, to protect them against exploitation by moneylenders and to preserve their social and cultural life.

THE Scheduled Areas have been constituted with two ???? objec tives. One is to assist the tribals in enjoying their existing rights and the second is to develop the Scheduled Areas and promote the eco nomic, educational and social progress of Scheduled Tribes.

THE Fifth Schedule visualises a division of responsibility between the state governments and the Union Government in the matter of administration of the Scheduled Areas. The State Government is directed to screen legislation unsuitable for extension to the tribal areas and to frame regulations for peace and good government. It is also the responsibility of the state government to implement special schemes of tribal welfare and general development of the Sched uled Tribes inhabiting within its boundaries. The Union Government takes the responsibility of providing guidance to the state government regarding administration of the Scheduled Areas and also to make available additional funds required to raise the administrative capa bility and standard of living of the tribal people. The Union Govern ment also enjoys power to give directions to the state governments regarding the implementation of any particular scheme, laying down priorities in their implementation and in regard to the general admin istration of the tribal areas.

THE Union Government's responsibility for the administration of the Scheduled Areas is not limited only to the provisions of funds for their development but extends to guiding the state governments and giving directions to them. This crucial role is provided for in Article 339(2) and Para 3 of the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution. It au gers well for the tribal communities that The Union Government have relied upon persuasion and the good sense of the state government to adopt a uniform policy for the development of Scheduled Areas

and rarely the situation demands a directive ;o the state govern ments. It is better if the unfortunate tribals are not dragged in unnecessary bickering and tug of war between crucial administra tive agencies. Further, periodical conferences are held with the Planning Commission and the Ministry of Home Affairs to review the progress in regard to the programmes and to consider difficul ties in their implementation.

#### Laws in the Scheduled Areas

IN THE matter of laws applicable to the Scheduled Areas the Gov ernor has been given powers to make regulations for their peace and good government. He has also the powers to direct that State and Central laws shall not apply to the Scheduled Areas or shall only apply with modifications.

## Role of the Traditional Tribal Council and the Advent of Panchayati Raj

THE institution of traditional tribal council is as old as the tribal society. Their functions have been primarily to decide social and religious matters in the light of their customary laws and, in some areas, to determine judicial matters also on the basis of the consent of the people as a whole. This does not mean that the tribal councils did not decide economic questions. This has been a part of their social irresponsibility. These tribal councils were not elected bodies. Heredity was often the basis, but many times character and the personal life of an individual elevated him to his coveted position. Despite such constraints, every adult had an equal right to argue and put forth any question and thus issues used to be settled through concensus. The decision of the councils are law to the tribals be cause they are based on their social customs and religious rites.

INTRODUCTION of statutory panchyati system throughout India has weakened the traditional tribal councils at some places, but gen erally speaking, these statutory panchayats have adopted almost all the Unctions of the traditional tribal council with the added respon sibility of implementing developmental work too. The functions of the statutory panchayats are, broadly speaking, administrative, eco nomic and social. Amongst the administrative functions are included watch and ward, control and regulations fairs, market, grazing grounds and village farm lands and functions pertaining to sanita tion and health. Amongst the economic functions are included func tions relating to development of agriculture, irrigation, conservation.

promotion of cottage industries and development of animal husbandry. Amongst social functions are included education and recreation, maternity and child welfare, etc. Commenting on the expansion of panchayati raj. the Report of the Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes Commission, 1961, rightly remarks that the foundations of tribal life should not be destroyed. The "traditional tribal councils should not disappear. They should be revived where they are weak and encouraged where they are strong. They have evolved naturally out of the conditions of life in the tribal areas and they command a ready allegiance from the people who are naturally more willing to cooperate with institutions which have an established position among them through long usage and convention.
