#### 58 TRIBAL INDIA

THE institution of marriage is another point on which the tribal people throughout the world have been much maligned. Wild and baseless charges were hurled at them, fantastic insinuations were formulated and many pseudo-scholars, claiming to have an intimate knowledge of the tribal world, let their imagination run riot for the benefit of a receptive readership. Some degree of laxity regarding sexual laision was taken to mean 'promiscuity' or free sex under which, according to such people, the institution of marriage could not exist. Such spicy phrases like 'sexual communism\* were coined to describe a non-existant social situation. 'Interestingly' no ethnographic data collected from any part of the world support this hypothesis. In India too the simplest and the rudest of tribal cultures we know, e.g. the Andamanese, the Kadar, the Paliyan, the Malapanthram, the Chenchu, the Birhor and others do not furnish us any evidence of promiscuity.

INDIAN tribes like tribes of other parts of the world practise several forms of marriage as a matter of convenience and social acclimatization in their respective cultural-ecological settings. ,

# Monogamy

MONOGAMY is a form of marriage in which no man may be married to more than one woman at a time. Majority of the Indian tribes practise monogamy. Just to refute the allegation that among the most backward and primitive tribes no clear-cut scheme of marriage exists, the example of the Kamar, a very backward tribe of Madhya Pradesh may be cited. This tribe is monogamous.

# Polygamy

POLYGAMY that is, marriage to more than one person, is fairly widespread all over the world. Among Indian tribes, there are many who are following this type of matrimonial alliance. Polygamy has two aspect: (i) polygamy, (ii) Polyandry. While polygamy is the marriage of one man to several women, polyandry means the marriage of one woman to several men. Both types of marriages are referred to as polygamy in common parlance.

POLYGYNY is found among the Naga tribes, the Gond, the Baiga, the Toda, the Lushai and most of the Proto-Australoid tribes of middle India. In most cases such form of marriage comes into existence as a result of disequilibrium in sex ratio. Obviously, in a society where the sex ratio is normal, such type of marriage may force many of the male Members to remain bachelor. Hence, normally such a practice develops in a society where the number of females is quite laiger than the males. In an otherwise normal situation it is the privilege of the powerful and rich who keep more than one wife as a symbol of prestige and status. Among the Indian tribes like Gond, Baiga and Lushai, this type of marriage is resorted, to facilitate a better division of labour.

POLYANDRY is, comparatively, much restricted in distribution. This type of matrimonial alliance is found in the Himalayan tract stretching from Kashmir to Assam and is popular among the Indo-Aryan and Mongoloid tribes. In its classical form it is prevalent among the Tiyan, the Toda, the Kota, the Khasa (Jounsari) and the Ladakhi Bota. It is also popular among the Tibetans.

AMONG the Indian tribes, two types of polyandry are in vogue. When several brothers share the same wife, as among the Khasa and the Toda, we have fraternal polyandry. Majumdar and Madan (1967) opine that in the general type, also found among the Toda of Nilgiri Hills, there need not be any close relationship between the husbands, and the wife goes to spend some time with each husband. So long as a woman lives with one of her husbands, the others have no claim over her. Nayar polyandry was of this type. Polyandry is not everywhere explicable with reference to a preponderance of men over women. In Ladakh, it was actually the women who were more in number. Among the Toda, property considerations and sexdisparity explain this institution. Polyandry is found to lead to fewer children to every woman, more male children, and a high incidence of sterility among women.

THE Khasa of Jounsar-bawar have evolved a very practical mode of polyandrous matrimony. Among them, when the eldest brother marries a girl, she automatically becomes the common wife of the rest of the brothers. If a brother is minor, he may, on becoming adult, marry another girl to match his age. Hence, this leads to a situation where a number of brothers have more than one wife which is not the classical mode of polyandry. Observing polygamy polyandry mixed up, Majumdar (ibid) coined an interesting phrase, Polygynandry, to describe this situation.

### 60\_TRIBAL INDIA

TILL some time back the Todas of Nilgiri Hills used to observe an interesting ceremony called bow and arrow ceremony to declare the paternity socially. In this ceremony, all brothers and the common wife assemble amidst the rest of the villagers in the fourth or fifth month of pregnancy of the wife and as a result of consensus one of the brothers presents a set of bow and arrow to the wife. This is taken as declaration that this particular brother will be accepted as father of the coming child. In this way 'sociological fatherhood' overrides the "biological fatherhood' in the bewildering mosaic of human affairs.

BESIDES demographic factors, an economic factor called bride wealth is also responsible for the prevalence of polyandiy among Indian tribes. Under the system of bride wealth the husband/husbands are obliged to give an agreed amount of cash/kind to the parents of the bride as price which usually varies according to the physical beauty and utility of the bride. With the passage of time the bride wealth continued to soar and a stage came when it became almost impossible to arrange the bride wealth individually. Furthermore, the agricultural holdings in mountains are quite uneconomic and the pursuit of cultivation too hard to be borne by a single individual. Hence, to avoid further fragmentation of holdings and sharing the enormous labour, such a mode of marriage might have come into existence.

ANOTHER mode of polygamy, which may be called "bigamy', is also in vogue, though on a very restricted scale. Under bigamy a man is allowed to marry two sisters at one time. This type of polygamy has been reported from the Holiya and Medara tribes of Mysore.

# Preferential Marriage and Prohibitions

IT IS observed that, on the one hand, the society prohibits sexual liaison or matrimonial alliances between particular kins or in the same clan or gotra but on the other hand, it encourages matrimonial alliances between certain other kins. In such cases there is a prescription, or only a preference, expressed for marriage to particular kin. The following are some of the popular types of 'preferential' marriages prevalent among the Indian tribes. a

#### (1) Cousin marriage

- (a) cross-cousin marriage
- (h) parallel-cousin marriage

(2) Levirate

(3) Sororate

BOTH types of cousin marriage, viz., cross-cousin marriage and parallel-cousin marriage are quite popular among the Indian tribes. The Gond, Kharia, Khasi and Kadar are some of the important Indian tribes practising cousin marriage. Anthropologically speaking, when the children of a brother and a sister marry, it is a cross-cousin marriage while it is parallel-cousin marriage when the children of two sisters or two brothers get married. A Gond is supposed to marry his or her cross-cousin, and if one likes to have this prescription waived in one's case, a compensation has to be paid to the losing party. Gross-cousin marriage, as observed by Majumdar, is often explained tq be a device for avoiding payment of a high bride price, and also for maintaining property in the household. The Gonds of Madhya Pradesh call this form of marriage doodh lautawa (return of milk). The implication is that the bride price paid by 'A' for his wife would be returned to his family when the daughter of 'A' marries her mother's brother's son. Claude Levi Strauss has said that preferential marriage has, for its main purpose, the strengthening of solidarity within tribe.

LE VTRATE and sororate are two other types of preferential marriages which are also said to promote Mnter-familial cordiality' by making certain linkages imperative. When a woman marries her deceased husband's brother this is called levirate. It may be split into two types: (a) junior levirate (b) senior levirate. When the woman marries her husband's younger brother, it is junior levirate while marriage with the elder brother is called senior levirate. When levirate occurs in non-polyandrous societies, it is of paramount importance because in the event of her husband's death, the widow finds a guardian, husband and partron while the children get a man as their father who has been loving them earlier too. Among some tribal groups, a degree of laxity is allowed in the matter of intimate social relations and sexual liaison between a woman and her husband's brothers as a prelude to the coming event. This situation may be termed as 'anticipatory levirate'

WHEN a man marries his wife's sister/sisters, it is sororate. It may occur after the death of his wife or even in her life. The death of a spouse is compensated by giving a new spouse, generally a younger sister of the deceased. Levirate and sororate emphasise the acceptance of inter-familial obligations and the recognition of marriage as a tie between two families, and not only between two individuals.

# Ways of Acquiring Mates

NINE important ways of acquiring a mate have been found to be popular among the Indian tribes :

- I. Marriage by capture
- 2. Marriage by exchange
- 3. Marriage by purchase
- 4. Marriage by elopement
- 5. Marriage by service
- 6. Marriage by intrusion
- 7. Marriage by trial
- 8. Marriage by mutual consent
- 9. Marriage by probation

WHEN a man forcibly snatched away a woman from her village and marries her, it is called marriage by 'capture'. Many tribal societies give social sanction to this type of marriage which symbolises valour and chivalry. Marriage by capture has been most popular among the Naga tribes of north-eastern region where Naga tribals of one village used to invade the enemy's village and capture grown up girls. This led to female infanticide. However, with the widening application of the Indian Penal Code and growing social consciousness as a result of culture contacts this practice is fast vanishing into oblivion. Cases of capture have also been reported from the Ho, who call it Oportipi and the Gond who call it Posiothur.

AMONG some other tribes like Bhumij, Kharia, Munda, Santhal, etc., this practice has given place to mock capture as a 'survival' of the old practice in which after finishing the marriage the parents of the girl request the groom to come to an agreed place and 'capture' their daughter. In a mock gesture, the girl (bride) also puts on symbolic resistance. Among some tribes like Ho, it is the exorbitant rate of bride price that often leads to marriage by capture.

MAJUMDAR reports that in Assam, physical captures take place during raids by one village on another. In middle India, the method is more peaceful, capture being effected on festival days at inter village meets when there is much revelry, drinking and intoxication. Such captures are given social sanction by requiring the gallant, who has made the capture, to pay a compensation and/or give a feast to the tribal brotherhood.

MARRIAGE by exchange has primarily been evolved as a means of avoiding the payment of high bride price. Under such a marriage two households exchange women with each other and thus avoid the payment of bride price. This practice is found, in varying degrees, all over India in which a man gives his sister or any other woman of his household in exchange of his wife. Interestingly, Khasi tribals of Meghalaya do not permit it.

MARRIAGE by 'purchase' is highly prevalent mode of matrimony throughout India. Bride price is the central theme in this type of marriage. This is paid either in cash or in kind or partly in cash and partly in kind. Lowie has emphasised that although the economic nature of this transaction cannot be minimised, it nevertheless would be wrong to regard the payment of a bride price as indicating sate and purchase. It may be only symbolic of the utility of women, and by way of compensation to her parent's family. Among the major tribes, marriage by payment of bride price is prevalent among the Munda, Oraon, Ho, Santhal, Rengma Naga, etc. The worst consequences of bride price are probably seen among the Ho tribals of Chotanagpur, Bihar. Their poor economic condition has been made worst by the ever increasing amount of bride price. The amount is so high, and to accept a lower amount being against one's status and prestige, that many young men and women remain unmarried. These unfortunate youngmen often resort to marriage by capture and the spinsters have often to undergo further injustice by being identified with witchcraft and sorcery. In many cases their natural desire to marry leads them into the clutches of the cunning moneylenders and the consequent bondedness.

MARRIAGE by elopement is also a peculiar feature of tribal India. As is well-known, child marriage is a new phenomenon is tribal India. They started adopting it as a result of culture contact with their Hindu neighbourhood. Previously, only adults entered into married life, and therefore, almost everywhere, marriage by mutual consent with parents' approval was the general rule. But with the changing times boys and girls started shedding their traditional submissiveness. In case the parents' consent is not forthcoming, elopement is generally the way out. Of course, the indulgent elders receive back the over-fond couple. This practice is often resorted to in the face of high bride price. The tribes of Chotanagpur are famous for one type of elopement or the other.

MARRIAGE by 'service' is another way of avoiding the payment of bride price altogether or minimising it considerably through service

rendered by the prospective groom at bride's residence. Thus, if a Gond or Baiga finds himself not in a position to pay the bride price, he goes to serve in his would-be father-in-law's house as a suitor servant and marries the desired girl after a lapse of some years. Pumm of Manipur recognise it as the only traditionally genuine mode of matrimony. They have to work in the bride's household for three years and have to fulfill all the responsibilities of a son. The boarding and lodging arrangements are taken care of by the would be-in-laws during the entire period of stay. Among the Birhor, the father-in-law often lends money, which is returned in installments to enable the son-in-law to pay the bride price. Till such time as the loan is repaid, the sone-in-law is compelled to stay at his father-inlaw's household.

THE opposite of 'marriage by capture' is also found among the Indian tribes and is known as 'marriage by instrusion'. This is the case of a girl desirous of marrying an unwilling youngman. In such a case the girl thrusts herself on the unwilling groom and his parents. She tries to serve the would be man in his life and his parents but is humiliated and tortufed in return. If she persists in her intentions and her endurance lasts for a considerable period she is finally accepted as daughter-in-law of the household. The Birhor and the Ho of Chotanagpur are some of the major tribes who practice it. Ho call it, very appropriately, anadar meaning humiliation or disrespect.

MARRIAGE by 'trial' is another way of acquiring mate among some of the Indian tribes. It is the recognition of personal courage and bravery as highly desirable traits in a youngman. The prospective groom has to prove his prowness before he can claim the hand of the desired girl. It is most popular among the Bhil. During the Holi festival yohgmen and women perform a folk dance round a pole or a tree to the top of which a coconut and gur are tied. All the youngmen and women are free to participate in the dance, locally c & Wed gol gadedho. The girls make an inner ring of dancers round the tree. When a youngman attempts to break through the cordon to climb the tree to eat the gur and break open coconut, the girls resist his attempt with their full force. The aspirant may incur even severe injuries but it is taken in good faith. If in spite of these obstacles, a daring man succeeds in this drama, he has the right to demand any of the surrounding girls as his wife.

MARRIAGE by 'mutual consent' is the result of the tribals' contact with Hindus. This practice is similar to that prevalent among the Muslims, Hindus, Christians, etc., in which all the formalities of

marriage are arranged by the parties concerned through the process of mutual consultation and consent.

PROBATIONARY marriage can be called as primitive version of modem practice of courtship before marriage. Under this practice the prospective husband and wife are permitted to live together for some time in bride's house. If they like each other and decide to marry, elders arrange their early marriage. In case the couple do not find each other's temperament to be suitable and compatible they separate and the man has to pay cash compensation to the girl's parents. Such a practice is widely prevalent among the Kuki of Arunachal Pradesh. Some tribal groups of Chotanagpur also approve of this practice and call it RaazUKhnshi.

## Pre-Marital and Eictra-Marital Sex Relations

THIS is another area of tribal life which has been shamelessly exploited by many authors and journalists who have tried to enter into overnight fame by unthoughtful and exaggerated versions of the tribals' pre-marital sex life. When the imagination of others run riot, it is to the anthropologist's credit who skillfully avoids these pitfalls and makes a serious and objective study of all the aspects of tribal life, including his sex life.

PRE-MARITAL sex relations, in varying degrees, are seen to be permissible all over tribal India, as with the tribal people of other parts of the world. Obviously, the conception of virginity or chastity in a society plays the crucial role in this context.

AMONG the tribes of middle India, pre-marital sex relations are overlooked unless of course they lead to pregnancy which is regarded as shameful for the girl's parents. Also for a girl to become pregnant is regarded as an extreme family disgrace. She is asked to name the child's father and he is forced to marry her. In this case the amount of bride price is either reduced considerably or it is waived altogether. Among the Konyak Naga, the girl continues to live in her parent's house even after marriage where her conduct is overlooked by the parents and other village people. Usually after the birth of her first child, she moves to her husband's household. Among the Murla Gond of Bastar, young boys and girls are traditionally allowed a degree of permissiveness within the four walls of the youth dormitoiy. All the stages of courtship are gone through and they get married with the blessings and approval of their parents. Ao Naga, too, do not attach undue importance to the so-called virginity of the girls.

## 66\_TRIBAL INDIA

EXTRA-MARITAL sex relations are not as common or permissible pre-marital liaison. It has been reported that among the Maria, the main cause of high incidence of murder and suicide has been marital infidelity. But the Tharu tribe of Uttar Pradesh presents an interesting spectacle. The Tharu men are said to be so much overwhelmed and ' overawed by the beauty of their wives that they play only second fiddle to them. The wife may indulge in extra marital sexual liaison and get away with it. as

THE Khasa of Uttar Pradesh have evolved a different value system regarding the extra-marital sex relations. Since most of the girls are married off at an early age, there is hardly any possibility of pre marital liaison. Hence, their main worry is about extra-marital relations. In her parental house, the wife is called dhanti, while in her husband's house she is called rhanti. These two seemingly ordinary words of native dialect carry a very significant connotation. When she is dhanti, a woman enjoys all sorts of freedom. She is a free bird. She can meet anybody, allow anybody to take liberties with her. But the same woman is like a chained slave while she is rhanti. In her husband's house she has to work hard in the fields and in house, she is generally frustrated and her conduct and movement always remain under the strict control of her husband/ husbands and other affinal relations. For a little respite, she comes to her parents' house generally during local fairs and festivals. The strains which these women suffer by being wife to several men, who are mentally and physically unlike each other, are relieved by the unfettered life which she can lead in her parents' village.

THIS sort of dual role prompted some anthropologists and sociologists like Majumdar (1962) and Saxena (1964) to term it as "dual morality" which is quite a misnomer when viewed by an outsider who tries to measure the moral fabric of these simple folk with his own yardstick of puritan hypocracy and so-called morality.

#### Divorce

UNLIKE Hindus, marriage is not a religious sacrament among the tribes of India. Hence, divorce or dissolution of marriage is not only possible but widely practised. It may easily be obtained if the parties no longer wish to live in wedlock.

THE ground for divorce, however, varies from tribe to tribe. The Khasis permit divorce for reasons of adultry, barrenness and incompatibility of temperament. In some cases, the party desiring the dissolution may have to pay compensation to the other party and remarriage between such people is not possible. The divorce, like

TRIBAL INDIA\_67

marriage, has to be a public ceremony where the mother gets the custody of the children. The Lushai, however, allow marriage between those once divorced. The Gond, Kharia and others also allow divorce freely on grounds of marital irfideiity, sterility, laziness, etc.

DESPITE contacts with the Hindus, widow remarriage is still practised among almost all the tribes of India and there is little likelihood of its discontinuation. Since widow remarriage carries no stigma among the Indian tribes, the plight of a young woman falling widow is far from miserable.
