MAN has the gift of a highly developed brain which enables him to engage in oiganized behaviour to exploit and harness nature. The groupings thus come into existence may have for their immediate cause and binding force several principles of integration: the simplest and most obvious of these is the principle of kinship, that is, relationship between different members of family based on marriage and on descent. "This relationship is of a three fold nature: that between husband and wife, that between parents and children; and that between children of the same parents "(Majumdar and Madan, 1967).

### Family

TRIBAL India exhibits a colourful diversity of families because of varied rules and customs among different tribes. Two types of families may be distinguished on the basis of the number of family members:

(i) simple or nuclear family, (ii) extended and joint family.

THE first type represents the basic grouping of the mates and their children. Such families have veiy limited number of members. Many Indian tribes like the Birhor, Pariya, Korwa, etc., maintain this type of family. If this nucleus is extended by the addition of other closely related kins, then it is called an extended family. If this is still further extended by the principle of kinship, then we get a family like the Hindu joint family. The Nairs of Kerala are taken as a classic example of this type of family and the Nair's Tharawad is an important institution in itself.

A VARIETY of families may also be distinguished on the basis of the number of marriage partners. Although most of the tribes have monogamous families, i.e., families consisting of a husband, a wife and children but polygamous families are also not very uncommon. Such families come into existence on the basis of two forms of polygamy vi^., polygyny and polyandry.

A POLYGYNOUS family consists of a husband, two or more wives and their children. This is a condition of marital arrangement common all over the tribal India. Then there are polyandrous families in

which the husbands are more than one, as for instance among the Todas of Nilgiri Hills of Tamil Nadu and the Khasas (Jounsari) of Jounsar-bawar in U.R where several brothers marry one wife without any exclusive right of cohabitation for any one spouse. The shortage of women was formerly due to the custom of female infanticide which tilted the sex ratio heavily towards the abundance of males. This does not imply, however, that sexual relations are promiscuous. Actually, strict rules are observed by the parties concerned; and when a child is bom, its paternity is established by means of a social ceremony instead of biological considerations.

SEVERAL other forms of family are also found among the tribes in India or the basis of authority of father and mother. Who is more important in the family, father or mother? This determines the patriarchal and matriarchal nature of the family. This situation further leads to two more sets of situations: patrilineal/matrilineal and patrilocal/ matrilocal. Most of the Indian tribes acknowledge the authority of father in family affairs and hence they have partriarchal families where descent is also traced from father, i.e., patrilineal and the wife leaves her parents' home and comes to reside with her husband, i.e., patrilocal. However the Khasis of Meghalaya and the Nairs of Kerala are the classic examples of the rare matrilineal, matriarchal and matrilocal family. The Khasis live in the Khasi and Jaintia Hills of Meghalaya.

They are famous all over the world as the best example of a society which is nearest to being matriarchal. They trace their desent from mythical female ancestresses. Their family consists of mother, her unmarried children, male and female, her husband, her married daughters and their husbands. Majumdar aptly remarks that whereas the Khasi family grows round a nucleus of blood-related females who are surrounded by fringe of males-unmarried brothers and sons, fathers and husbands and whereas property, authority, religion, residence are all in the hands of women, menfolk also are respected and even exercise some authority. The all powerful Khasi woman addresses her husband as her lord. The above description is the traditional situation and the Khasis are also changing with times.

### Kinship

PEOPLE in all parts of the world and in all the societies, irrespective of their technological level, are bound together in groups by various kinds of bonds. The most universal and the most basic of these bonds is that which is based on reproduction, an inherent human

drive, and is called kinship. But social recognition is seen to override biological fact in the affairs of kinship, especially among the primitive societies all over the world.

THE tribes of India are divided into lineages. While most of the tribes are divided into patrilineages, Khasi and Garo of Meghalaya have matrilineages.

LIKE other people of India, the tribal population too recognizes both types of kinship viz., consanguinous kinship and affinal kinship. While consanguinous kinship includes all the kins related through blood or biological ties, affinal kins consist of those recognized through marriage. But an interesting and significant fact, as mentioned earlier, is that the consanguinous kinship among them does not include only biological ties. The case of Todas of Nilgiri Hills following fraternal polyandry may be cited as an instance where paternity is established through iow and arrow ceremony'. Until another brother makes the ceremonial presentation, all children bom to her of several brothers are regarded as the children of the brother who last performed the ceremony.

THE most profound impact of kinship ties on the social life may be felt, through kinship usages found in every society. Kinship usages among the tribes of India present very interesting and significant spectacle. Such types of behaviour pattern, verbal and non-verbal, explain many complex intricacies of kinship system.

IT HAS been found among many tribes that many sets of kins avoid each other. The avoidance between daughter-in-law and parents-inlaw is quite common. Likewise, though less universally and also less rigorously, a son-in-law's relations with his parents-in-law are found to be cramped by certain restrictions. Among the tribes of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the elder brother does not talk with his younger brother's wife. Radcliffe-Brown has given one of the most plausible of contemporary explanations. He points out that avoidance is a social fact and must, therefore, have a social explanation. He says that whenever people come in contact with each other the possibilities of cooperation as well as conflict are always equally present. But there are certain kinds of kinship where hostility is regarded as against social norms. The best way to prevent such hostility from becoming manifest is to put restrictions on the growth of intimacy; and hence the kinship usages of avoidance. Freud's psycho-analytical explanation is based on sexual attraction and the need to prevent sexual intimacy between various kinds of relatives.

ANOTHER kinship usage which is reverse of the avoidance relationship is an extreme degree of familiarity expressed through joking relationships. Such joking may amount even to exchange of abuse, obscene and vulgar references to sex, ridicule and so no. Apart from joking relationship between sister-in-law and brother-inlaw and between a wife and her husband's brothers, such relationships have also been reported between grandparents and grandchildren among the Oraons and the Baigas. The Ho tribe of Chotanagpur also indulge in a variety of joking relationships. Majumdar opines that joking relationships may be indicative of equality and mutual reciprocity. They may also be indicative of a potential sexual relationship. Thus, is explained the joking relationship between a man and his wife's younger sister or elder brother's wife. In each case the two may be potential mates. A joking relationship, when not mutual, assumes the role of social control. It becomes indicative of correction through ridicule.

AVUNCULATE and amitate, as known in anthropological parlance, are two other kinship usages prevalent among the Indian tribes. Among the Khasis, Garos, Nairs, and a couple of other societies the maternal uncle enjoys a pre-eminent place in the life and affection of his nephews and nieces as a matter of convention. He has special obligations towards them which exceed those of their father and transmits his property to his nephew. The kinship usage is called avimculate. Obviously, this is a common usage among matrilineal societies. A special role, similar to that outlined in case of the maternal uncle, for one's father's sister is designated as amitate. This is explicable in patrilineal tribes.

AMONG Khasi, Toda, Ho, Oraon, and a host of other tribes, a queer practice has been reported, called couvade, on the basis of a similar practice known among the Trobriand Islanders by the same name in their local dialect. The practice consists in "making a husband lead the life of an invalid alongwith his wife whenever she gives birth to a child. He refrains from active life, goes on sick diet and observes certain taboos" (Majumdar and Madan, 1967). Thus, the Khasi husband, like his wife cannot cross a stream or wash clothes until the spirits connected with child-birth are propitiated. Sometimes, among some other tribes, this practice is extended to the extent of putting up the poor husband in an adjacent hut to his wife and made to ape the actions of his wife. Malinowski believed couvade to be a cementing bond of married life and a social mechanism designed to secure paternal affection. Other

anthropologists have sought to give a psycho-analytical explanation. They have attributed this usage to the husband's desire to lighten the wife's discomforts, in the absence or lack of proper modern medical care, by a process of participation through identification. Some scholars have attributed this practice to the matriarchal and matrilineal mode of social organization but the prevalence of this practice, till recent past, among some patriarchal and patrilineal societies like the Ho, Oraon, etc., negates this assertion.
