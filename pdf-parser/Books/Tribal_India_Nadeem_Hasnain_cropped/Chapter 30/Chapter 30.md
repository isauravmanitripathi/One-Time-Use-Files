# ADMINISTRATION AND INSTITUTIONAL SET UP

Chapter 30

![](_page_0_Picture_1.jpeg)

THE advent of independence of India promised a new deal to its tribal population. The object of this promise was to 'level up\* the underdeveloped tribal people with the help of special safeguards. Article 46 of the Indian Constitution lays down as a Directive Principles of the State Policy that "the State shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people, and in particular of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation". Article 275 provides grants from the Union to the States for meeting the cost of development schemes undertaken with the approval of the Centre for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes in a state, or raising the level of administration of the Scheduled Areas therein to that of the administration of the rest of the areas of that state. A three-tier administrative set up was organised by the government for implementing its tribal development policies and programmes.

## 1. Administrative Set up at the Centre

THE Ministiy of Home Affairs was inchaige of the work pertaining to the welfare of Scheduled Tribes till 1964 when it was taken over by a new department created under the name of Department of Social Security, T^e suggestion that a separate department should be set up in the Ministry of Home Affairs to deal exclusively with the welfare of Backw'ard Classes had been made by the Study Team on Social Welfare and Welfare of Backward Classes. The Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes Commission, which was appointed by the President subsequently under Article 339 of the Constitution, however, su^ested the establishment of a separate department in the Home Ministiy to deal exclusively with tribal problems. As rightly pointed out by the Shilu Ao Committee Report, this recommendation was made keeping in view the need for accelerating the tempo of development of the tribal communities. The clubbing of tribal welfere with the welfare of Scheduled Castes and other backward classes not realistic. Whereas the problems of the Scheduled Castes concerned with backwardness arising out of a pernicious social system based on caste, the backwardness of tribal communities has was are

its origin in conditions created by geography. Hence, it needs an altogether different approach to tackle this problem. When the Department of Social Security was set up in 1964 as a separate entity, it was placed under the chaige of the Minister of Law. The Home Ministry, while transferring the work relating to welfare of Backward Classes including tribal welfare to the new Department retained control of service matters and the administration of Scheduled and Tribal Areas. The Department of Social Security was also made responsible for certain other subjects dealt with previously by the Ministries of Education, Home Affairs, Labour and Employment and Industry. Later on in 1966, the Department was reorganised under the present designation of Department of Social Welfare and certain subjects handled by it were transferred to the Ministries of Education, Commerce, and Labour, Employment and Rehabilitation. There was a further reshuffle in 1967 when certain subjects dealt with by the Planning Commission and the Ministries of Home Affairs and Education were transferred to it. Besides being inchaige of social welfare and a host of other things, the Department of Social Welfare is responsible for the welfare of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Ex-Criminal Tribes and other backward classes. The work relating to service safeguards in respect of the Scheduled Tribes and the administration of Scheduled and Tribal Areas, however, continued to be the responsibility of the Ministry of Home Affairs. A full-fledged Director of Tribal Development is a later addition in the Ministry of Home Affairs.

UNTIL 1967, there was no machinery worth the name in the Department for formulating welfare schemes for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and for watching the progress of their implementation in the states. The Commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes appointed under Article 338 of the Constitution was, however, performing these duties in addition to his function as specified in the Constitution. As this arrangement was considered to be unsatisfactoiy, it was decided to relieve the Commissioner of the functions of follow up of schemes for the welfare of backward classes, watching progress and maintaining liaison with the state and transfer them to a separate organisation set up under the Director-General of Backward Classes Welfare. Under this arrangement the field oiganisation of the Commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes which consisted of 17 regional offices was transferred to the Director of Backward Classes Welfare who was redesignated as Director-General. The regional offices on transfer were regrouped into five zonal offices, each headed by a zonal

#### 470 \_ TRIBAL INDIA

director under the overall control of the Director-General. The zonal directors are assisted by one or more deputy directors and are expected to maintain close liaison with the state governments to ensure rapid implementation of the welfare programmes.

THUS, we see that the welfare of the weaker sections (including scheduled tribes) was entrusted to a number of ministries/ departments. With a view to providing an integrated thrust to the development of these sections of the population, a new Ministry of Welfare was constituted on the 25th of September, 1985 by integrating the subjects concerning; (i) Welfare of the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Socially and Economically Backward Classes/ Other Backward Classes, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, earlier dealt with by the Ministry of Home Affairs; (ii) the work relating to the wel^ of the disabled (blind, deaf, dumb, orthopaedically and mentally handicapped) and programmes of Social Defence connected with the victims of alcoholism, drug addiction. Juvenile maladjustments, welfare of aged dealt with earlier by the erstwhile Ministry of Social and Women's Welfare and (Hi) matters relating to the administration of wakf, earlier dealt with by the Ministry of Law. With effect from 26 April, 1990, the Department of Women and Child Development was shifted to the Ministry of Welfare, which was as a consequence reorganized into (i) the Department Welfare and (ii) the Department of Women and Child Development. The work of the Department of Welfrre is transacted under six major areas. Thus, we see that the Ministry of Welfare served as the nodal ministry for the matters pertaining to the Scheduled Tribes.

SINCE, the thrust of majority of this Ministry's programmes was to empower the weaker and socially and economically deprived sections of the society, the Ministry of Welfare was renamed as Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment in 1998. This was entrusted with the welfare, social justice and empowerment of disadvantaged and marginalised sections of the society viz.. Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Minorities, Backward Classes, Disabled, ,Aged persons. Street Children and victims of Drug abuse etc.

### Current Set-up

HOWEVER, yet another change has been introduced. Now for the first time a separate and independent Ministry of JHbal Affairs has been created. This has been carved out from the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment in October, 1999.

### Mandate of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs

- I. Social security and social insurance with respect to the Scheduled Tribes.
- 2. Tribal Welfare: Tribal welfare planning, project formulation, research, evaluation, statistics and training.
- 3. Promotion and development of voluntary efforts on tribal welfare,
- 4. Scheduled Tribes, including scholarship to students belonging to such tribes.
- 5. Development of Scheduled Tribes.
- 6. Attached or Subordinate offices or other orpnization concerned with any of the subjects specified in this list.
- 7. (i) Scheduled Areas
  - (ii) Matters relating to autonomous districts of Assam excluding roads and bridge works and ferries thereon; and
- (iii) Regulations framed by the Governors of States for Scheduled Areas and for Tribal Areas specified in part \*A' 20 of the Sixth of the Table appended to paragraph Schedule to the Constitution;

  - (ii) Issue of directions regarding the drawing up and execution of schemes essential for the welfare of the Scheduled Tribes in any State.

#### NOTE

THE Ministry of Tribal Affairs shall be the nodal ministry for overall Policy, Planning and Coordination of programmes of development for the Scheduled Tribes in regard to sectoral programmes and schemes of development of these communities, policy, planning, monitoring, evaluation etc. as also their co-ordination will be the responsibility of the concerned Central Ministries/ Departmente, State Governments and Union Territory Administrations. Each Central Ministry/Department will be nodal Ministry or Department concerning ifs sector.

### Commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes

UNDER Article 338 of the Constitution, a special officer known as Commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes has been working since November, 1950. As pointed out by the Dhebar Commission, the office of the Commissioner has a special significance in the scheme of tribal welfare. It is also a link between the Constitution on the one hand and the Union Government and the State Government on the other. It is the medium through which the Union Government and Parliament are kept informed of the progress in implementations of the safeguards for Scheduled Tribes and of schemes for their welfare.

#### Functions

THE Commissioner's function as given in Article 338 of the constitution are to investigate and report on the working of the safeguards by means of an annual report which he submits to the President of India and which is subsequently discussed in Parliament. Like the Governor's report, this report is intended to assist the President, Parliament and the Union Government to discharge their responsibility under the Constitution. The Union Government has not thought it fit to issue any instructions to the Commissioner on the content or form of the report, possibly because it did not want to fetter his jurisdiction or hammer his initiative. The result of this freedom has been that every year a document is placed before the Parliament which describes the achievements, failures and deficiencies in the administration of the Scheduled Areas and the welfare of the Scheduled Tribes in the form of a narration.

THE Commissioner is assisted by two Deputy Commissioners, one Assistant Commissioner and some research and secretarial staff. While reorganising the set up of the Commissioner's office in 1967, it was envisaged that the Commissioner could indent on the services, among others, of research institutions, universities and voluntary agencies, for organising special studies on selected problems. To enable the Commissioner to reimburse the cost of such, studies, the provision necessary for the purpose may be placed at his disposal.

SINCE the problems of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes are basically different, as pointed out earlier, the Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribe Commission found it imperative to recommend the appointment of a separate Commissioner for Scheduled Tribes. While reiterating the suggestion, the Shilu Ao Committee Report suggested that if considered necessary. Article 338 of the Constitution may be amended to provide for the appointment of two special officers-one for the Scheduled Castes and another for the Scheduled Tribes.

### Non-Statutory Function :

BY SUBSEQUENT arrangement with the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Commissioner came to assure the following functions in addition to his statutory duties :

- (i) evaluation of the progress of welfare schemes undertaken by the ' state governments and non-official agencies with grants-in-aid from the Centre;
- (ii) representation of the Union Government, on the managing committees of non-official organisations receiving grants from the Centre;
- (iii) examination of the accounts of the non-official organisations receiving grants from the Centre; and
- (iv) advising the Union Government regarding the schemes received from the state governments.

### National Commission for Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes

BY VIRTUE of the Constitution (Sixty fifth Amendment) Apt, 1990 the Commissioner's post under Article 338 of the Constitution has been substituted by the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The commission shall consist of Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson and five other members to be appointed by the President under his hand and seal. The commission shall have the power to regulate its own procedure.

IT SHALL be duty of the commission :

Tribes and to evaluate the progress of their development under the Union and any state;

- (d) to present to the President annually and at such other times as the commission may deem fit, reports upon the working of these safeguards;
- (e) to make in such reports recommendations as to the measures that should be taken by the Union or any state for the effective implementation of those safeguards and other measures for the protection, welfare and socio-economic development of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes; and
- (f) to dischaige such Other functions in relation to the protections, welfare and development and advancement of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as the President may, subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament, by rule specify.

THE President shall cause all such reports to be laid before each House of Parliament alongwith a memorandum explaining the action taken or proposed to be taken on the recommendations relating to the Union and the reasons for the non-acceptance, if any, of any of such recommendations.

WHERE any such report or any part thereof, relates to any matter with which any state government is concerned, a copy of such report shall be forwarded to the Governor of the State alongwith a memorandum explaining the action taken or proposed to be taken on the recommendations relating to the state and ^e reasons for the non-acceptance, if any, of any of such recommendations.

THE commission shall, investigating and monitoring any matter relating to the safeguards provided for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under the Constitution or any other law for the time being in force or under any order of the Government and to evaluate the working of such safeguards and to enquire into specific complaints with respect to the deprivation of rights and safeguards of the Scheduled C^tes and Scheduled Tribes, have all the powers of a Civil Court trying a suit and in particular in respect of the following matters, namely:-

# National Commission for Scheduled Tribes

It was established by amending Article 338 and inserting a new Article 338A in the Constitution. The term of office of Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson and members is three years. The Chairperson has been given the rank of Union Cabinet Minister, Vice-Chairperson that of a Minister of State and other Members have the rank of a Secretaiy to the Government of India.

Thus, there is now a separate Commission for Scheduled Tribes looking after the STs exclusively,

# n. Set up at the State Level '

AS ENJOINED by the Article 164 of the Constitution, the states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa have full-fledged ministries of tribal welfare. It is obvious that the intention of the framers of the Constitution in incroporating these provisions was to ensure that adequate attention was paid to the tribal people, particularly in areas where their population was laiige.

THE administrative set up dealing with the tribal programmes vanes from state to state. Thus, while there are separate Tribal and Hanjan Welfere departments in Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal, Tnbal Areas and Welfare of Backward Classes Department in Assam, Tnbal and Rural Welfare Department in Orissa and Welfare Department m Bihar, in most of the other states, the DepartmentsA3irectorates of Social Welfare are charged with the responsibility of administenng the tribal welfare programmes.

HAVING observed the organisation in the state secretariats, the Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes Commission has strongly recommended that there should be a separate department for tribal welfare in the states where the tribal population is more than a million. This will include some other states who do not fall under Article 164 of the Constitution but have come to contain substantial population of Scheduled Tribes. In this way programmes for the

#### 476\_TRIBAL INDIA

welfare and development of the tribal people in several other states may get more impetus. Besides, this department should not be saddled with other functions such as social welfare or the welfare of Scheduled Castes or Backward Classes because the schemes for Scheduled Tribes cover the entire sector of development and are, therefore, of a different nature from the social welfare schemes. The department should be only a policy-making and coordinating department, a counterpart in the states to the department in the Ministry of Home Affairs.

### III. Set up at the District and Below

EFFECTIVE implementation of policies and welfare programmes for the tribals is at the district level. The District Magistrate, his subordinate staff and officers of various departments working in the district form the executive agency and upon the efficiency of this agency depends, to a veiy laige extent, the speedy and effective implementation of welfare and development programmes. At present there is no uniformity in the executive agency at the district level.

NORMALLY, the collector is incharge of the district and he i: responsible for all the development activities carried on by various departments. Now the task has been entrusted to Chief Development Officers (CDO) in several states. The multiplicity of agencies and their relative independence and lack of coordination between them leave veiy little discretion in the hands of the collector. There may be a social welfare officer to ensure certain amount of coordination and keep the collector informed with the progress of the schemes. In some states, the deputy commissioner is the head of a division and he is in effective chaige of all developmental activities. He has subdivisional officers and technical officers to assist him and they are under his administrative control. He is thus able to enforce rules and regulations in his chaige, regulate developmental activities and ensure their implementation. This may be called a single-line administration. Another pattern which has been prevalent in some other states compose of the Scheduled Area having been formed into a separate district placed under the charge of a deputy commissioner with sweeping powers. Under the difficult climatic conditions prevailing in some states like Himachal Pradesh where it is difficult to obtain government orders in time, such a pattern has proved its utility. IS

NOW village panchayats exist in all the states and in nearly all the Union Territories. With the introduction of the system of democratic decentralisation, the responsibility for the implementation of various welfare and developmental schemes has been transferred to the panchayats. The implementation of developmental schemes at grassroot level with the help of the panchayat is working fairly well in the non-tribal rural areas, but it has not made much headway in tribal areas especially among relatively backward ones. The only reason that can be advanced for this unsatisfactory response is that the new set up does not conform to their customs and traditions and is looked upon by them as both alien and incongruous.

### Tribes Advisory Councils

IN ACCORDANCE with the provisions of the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution, Tribes Advisory Councils have been set up in all the states having Scheduled Areas - Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa and Rajasthan. Such Councils have also been set up in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, which have no Scheduled Area but have Scheduled Tribes. Tribal Advisory Committees or Boards on more or less the same lines as the Tribes Advisory Council have been set up in most of the other States and Union Territories. Where there are no such boards or committees specifically for Scheduled Tribes, the tribal interests are watched by the general advisory boards. The Tribes Advisory Councils are to consist of not more than twenty members, of whom as nearly as might be, three-fourth were to be Scheduled Tribes representatives in the legislative assemblies. The Governors were required to make rules prescribing the mode of appointment. It has been a general practice with the Chief Minister to be the Chairman of these bodies. Obviously, the presence of the Chief Minister as the Chairman gives the tribal representatives an added confidence. The Dhebar Commission has also supported this practice and has recommended that the Chairman of a Tribes Advisoiy Council should be a person who has influence beyond the immediate department concerned, for it is expected to deal with problems that concern all the departments.

### Some Administrative Issues

TILL recently, the administrators did not realize or appreciate the fact that development administration was basically different from general administration, and further that tribal development administration was still more different as it was devoted to the special interests of extremely backward communities who required special attention and care. If such a developmental task is to be accomplished it cannot be entrusted to the general run of administrators. Therefore, it is of

#### 478 \_TRIBAL INDIA

the utmost importance that administrators for tribal development task are selected with the greatest care. Only those with a sense of commitment are likely to be effective. Further, the tribal areas offer challenging opportunities to such administrators who could want to do some creative work, different from the routine kind. Unfortunately administrators of such description are not forthcoming in sufficient numbers. H.M. Mathur (1981) is of the view that there should be enough people who will be simply fascinated by the kind of work that awaits them in tribal areas. But often it is the personnel policies and practices which fail to attract, retain and motivate the best people. Partly the urban bias In recruitment, training, placement, career pattern, etc., accounts for the lack of attraction for these assignments. It looks that the existing personnel policies will need to be modified to reflect a greater concern for the tribal development programmes.

AMONG the factors responsible for unsatisfactory implementation and, in some spheres, failures of the programmes for tribal development, institutional and administrative failure also account for a great extent. S.K. Sharma (1981), while dwelling upon tribal underdevelopment in India, expresses the view that the establishment of a multitier structure of decentralized tribal development management immediately creates problems of inter-institutional linkages. In tribal areas, the existing administrative systems in most situations were based upon the concept of a single-line administrative hierarchy, but the development programmes involved simultaneous action at so many points that administrative integration of the field projects was no longer possible. Historically, there was a tendency to operate a centralized administrative structure with only a minimum of penetration into tribal areas, but the new challenges led to the establishment of network of administrative institutions operating far away in the field. This shift in the focus had its implications for personnel administration. Behind institutional, administrative and bureaucratic obstacles, is the outmoded system of financial sanctions and obsolescent system of realising funds. The tight method of administrative control would have to give way to corporate management, bringing officers from various professions and departments to adopt plant jointly and accepting common

responsibility for their implementation.
