YOUTH dormitories among the tribals of India have been so much romanticised and sensationalised on the basis of their romantic, erotic aspect that truth rarely comes out except in the text-books of anthropology, such an institution like the youth dormitory is found all over the world among primitive societies and one of the most exquisite descriptions of such a dormitoiy is that of the Trobriand Islander's bukumatula given by Malinowki, the great British anthropologist.

MAJUMDAR (1967) while giving the distribution of dormitories in tribal India tells us that dormitories, bi-sexual as well as monosexual, are found in practically all parts of the countiy where the tribal people have their habitation. They are found in Assam; the Konyak Nagas designate the boy's dormitory as ban and the girl's dormitoiy as yo. The Ao Nagas call it arichu, whereas the Memis have two names for it, the men's dormitory being called ikhuchi and women's iloichi. The Angami Nagas call it Kitchuki. It is also found among the Bhotias of the sub-Himalyan region of north Uttar Pradesh, who call it rangbang. The Munda and the Ho tribes of Chhotanagpur have it too and designate it as gitiora. The Oraons call it jonkerpa or dhumkuriya; the Bhuiyas know it as dhangarbassa and the Gonds as gotul. In south India the existence of dormitories has been reported from amongst the Muthuvenas, the Mannams and the Paliyans. The Kunikaras also have a bachelors hall which serves also the purposes of accommodating bachelors and visitor guests.

THE subject of origin is always controversial and the truth remain dropped in the mist and darkness of the past. How, when-and under what circumstances the youth dormitories originated is also a matter of debate and discussion. Hodson believes that they are a 'survival' of communal houses which were the first stage in the development of homes and when the whole village lived together. Some other scholars hold the view that the dormitory was designed to prevent incest, to save the children from witnessing the primal scene, or to save the parents from being watched, while engaged in sexual intercourse, by young unmarried children. Among some primitive societies sexual intercourse is prohibited during the busy agricultural

season, and therefore, a man's house has to be separately provided for. During such times, the lonely women would also have to keep together among themselves. Besides, menstruating women have often to be segregated. Among the Marias and the Murias, husbands are not allowed to sleep within the house with their wives so long as the naval chord of the new bom child does not fall. Also, many tribes do not permit sexual relationship between men and women till child is weaned. Further, Grigson reports about the Hill Marias that, generally speaking, they do not regard the home as the proper place for sexual intercourse. Some or all of the above mentioned reasons may have led to having a common dormitoiy house for both the sexes.

TWO types of youth dormitories are found among the tribes of India. Some may be common, i.e., shared by both boys and girls as is the case with the Muria gotui or they may be confined to one sex only, as are the Konyak morung and yo.

MOSTLY, the dormitories are built on the outskirts of the village so that their members may maintain secrecy and cany on their activities without any disturbance. The dormitory is generally housed in a specially built building, which may be simple and bleak, like the one doored, low roofed dhumkuriya of the Oraon, or elaborate with carved wooden doors like that of Naga morung.

THOUGH the life lived inside dormitories appears to be of a light hearted type on the surface, however, as Majumdar puts it, underlying these semblances are deep socio-economic and educative motives. Youths collect in the dormitories by the evening to dance, sing, play, tell each other folktales and folklore and later to sleep for the night. It's members may be divided into two sections - the seniors and the juniors. It is the seniors who being well versed in tribal lore and tradition^ pass on what they have learnt and experienced to the juniors, who in their turn, one day assume the role of seniors. The officers who are supposed to manage the affairs of the dormitoiy are chosen ftom amongst the seniors. They are also supposed to control the activities within the dormitory and maintain discipline.

WHERE there is a dormitory, it is obligatoiy on the part of the boys and girls to become its members. Though the age at the time of entiy into dormitoiy varies from tribe to tribe yet the common average age seems to be around ten years and the membership continues till the member gets married.

BESIDES the recreational activities, its members led by the 'officer' assist in several collective endeavours like doing work at marriage.

house-building or harvesting. Its members stay with their house people during the day but after taking the evening meal they proceed towards their respective dormitories.

THE members are supposed to maintain strict secrecy as regards the activities inside the dormitory. Majumdar states that this happens particularly in view of the fact that amorous affairs are freely carried on inside the dormitories, although sexual intercourse is not, generally speaking, permitted within their four walls. In the Muria gotul, senior girls often train younger boys in the sexual act, and no permission is needed from the leaders for sexual intercourse. An interesting, but inadequately investigated, aspect of dormitory life is the comparative infertility of the numerous sexual liaisons established inside or outside the dormitory during one's membership days. There is also evidence of the use of the rhythm method of birth control. So far as the Murias themselves are concerned, they give many supernatural explanations, such as that of the gotul being protected by Lingo, its patron god. Sexual congress taking place inside the gotul would not lead to pregnancy, since such a thing happening would bring disgrace to Lingo himself. They offer sacrifices and prayers to prevent impregnation which is not however regarded as much of social stigma. It only complicates the economic aspect of marriage due to the presence of a child who after his mother's marriage to her child's father or someone else, is accepted as a fullfleged member of the wife's husband's household.

THE social and sexual training imparted in dormitories proves very crucial in the coming married life of the members and cannot be dismissed as unimportant or unhealthy. Interestingly, even the most advanced societies of the world lack such a training in an institutionalized manner.

S.C. ROY, the famous ethnographer who has done pioneering work among several major Indian tribes, provides a three-fold purpose for the dormitoiy of Oraons of Chhotanagpur. Firstly, it is said to serve as an effective economic organization for purposes of the food quest; secondly, as a useful seminary for training young men in their social and other duties; and thirdly, as a place for the performance of magico-religious ceremonies designed to bring about success in hunting and to augment the procreative powers of youngmen. Inderjit Singh while talking about the Gonds mentions participation in joint economic pursuits, training in social and sexual behaviour and provision of accommodation as important functions of the gotul.

## Decline

CULTURE contacts with the Hindus and spread of Christianity in the tribal areas are two major causes for the decay of the dormitory institution. Majumdar is of the view that culture contacts with the non-tribals have proved disastrous for the institution of dormitory. Frequent and deeper contacts with the urban ways of living have resulted in the loss of love for, and confidence in, their own typical ways of living. Attempts are made to rise in the estimation of the neighbouring non-tribal people, and in this process indigenous institutions are often sacrificed.

THUS, boys going to schools not only disown going to donnitories but actually stop going there. It has been found that the Ho tribe, with their deep contacts with urban agencies, have constantly denied the existence of giitora, their donnitory institution, reported by earlier investigations.

THE spread of Christianity has also played its part. All the tribals, in middle India or in north-eastern region, who have been converted to Christianity, have been brainwashed by the missionaries to dismantle the very institution of dormitory. These tribal folks are not allowed to go to the dormitory. The result of such a sustained and systematic effort is that the youth dormitories have disappeared from the villages of the Christian tribals.

THE decay of once virile, colourful, and useful institution of dormitory among the tribes of India is a study in melancholy. Sachidananda's various studies of the tribal life in Chhotanagpur region bring forth the present condition of dormitory. While making a study of Ratu, Mandar and Chiri tribal villages of Chhotanagpur, he remarks that the present condition of dhumkuriya is much different than it was 40-50 years ago. It seems that this institution is breathing its last. In several villages the only thing left in the name of dhumkuriya is a dilapidated and neglected house standing as a memorial to a great social institution of the tribal folks.
