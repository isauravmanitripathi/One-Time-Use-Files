# I CAN'T BEAR ANY MORE : **Discontent and Rebellion**

Chapter 18

![](_page_0_Picture_1.jpeg)

THE tribal people of India have been a subject of interest for a variety of people for a variety of reasons. In most of the cases they have been portrayed as a segment of Indian society, primitive and simple, having exotic customs and practices and leading a veiy colorful life. Some have painted in different color-people having such interesting and romantic institutions as Ghotul and Dhumkuria and who are fighting a losing battle against the onslaught of commercialization and industrialization. Few have tried to peep through these superficial curtains behind which we find these peoples being crushed under the yoke of poverty, ignorance, disease and all sort of heart-breaking exploitation.

FOR ages, the Indian tribal population has lived a life of geographical isolation. A.B.Vardhan (1977) rightly comments that the British imperialists had deliberately isolated the tribal people from the rest of the population, because they were aware of the explosive potentialities of these people. In their efforts to keep the tribal isolated, the British administrators converted them into prohibited areas open only to Christian missionaries and alien administrators. Gradually, the henchmen of the alien rule viz. local landlords and moneylenders were allowed access to these areas. In the initial stages, the national movement under the bouigeoise leadership also ignored their tribal brethren and thus the gap between tribal and non-tribal Indian people widened. Thakkar Bapa has the most liberal and sympathetic view for tribals among our national leadership in the freedom strU^le. He was a social worker of high order who dedicated himself to the welfare and upliftment of tribals. But being a typical social worker and preacher, he could never apprehend and revolutionaiy capabilities of the tribals nor help them foige links with the other exploited and oppressed people. zones

NO JUSTICE can be done to our tribal people without acknowledging the fact that they were the earliest fighters and front rankers against the alien rulers and have made remarkable sacrifices. Many of our historians ignore their contribution in the long struggle for freedom. Some, in the moment of self-realization and self criticism describe the earliest tribal rebellions as Mocal rebellions\* and 'stray explosions\*

having no bearings on freedom struggle. In the light of this injustice it seems imperative to remember atleast two rebellions, i.e., Santhal rebellion and Munda rebellion of ninelieenth century as a tribute to valour of our tribal brethren. Two more rebellions also to be described in the present chapter viz. Mizo rebellion and Naga rebellion, have a different perspective and hence shall be described in a different vein.

# SANTHAL RebeUion

THE Santhal are one of the most important tribes of India and they inhabit a vast area stretching from Bihar to the present Bangladesh. Santhal Paigana is the centre of their land and they speak Mundari dialect Traditionally, they are very proud of their language and culture and even conversion into Christianity could not destabilize their political unity. They are famous throughout the world for their bloody armed rebellion against the mighty British colonial rule in 1855-56.

THE Kol rebellion, though dated as far back as 1830, was the harbinger of coming rebellions. But it cannot be compared with santhal rebellion which occurred on a vast tract of land on a much larger scale and magnitude. It was fierce mass against the alien rulers and their local stooges-landlords, moneylenders and local officials. The santhal rebellion engulfed vast tracts of the present Bihar and West Bengal and its intensity had touched the areas as hundred miles from Calcutta. The 'invincible' British rulers able to crush this rebellion with the help of several regiments near as were of their mighty and well equipped army and by resorting to ruthless massacre of thousands of santhal tribals. The legendary heroes of this rebellion, Kanu and Sidda Murmu, deserve a place among the list of national heroes of India.

LIKE many other Indian tribes the Santhal, too collectively owned the forests and agriculture land. The East India Company interfered with this system and keeping their vested interest in mind they introduced such a system of land ownership and revenue that gave birth to landlordism. The landlords were intended to be used as their second line of defence in any struggle to safeguard their interest. Meanwhile the annual tax which the East India Company has been collecting from this region was almost trebled. This was beyond the paying capacity of Santhal cultivators. Under the increasing pressure of population, many outsiders also started settling in this region and with their vast money power they spread their influence within a short time. The vagaries of nature were also playing their part. Thus, with

every falling step, the Santhal became more and more vulnerable. Under such conditions of vulnerability, the landlords, and moneylendere found themselves stronger than ever. The Santhals were o^'ired credit facilities at their doorstep. This provided some relief to them in the initial stages but the money offered was 'credit' not 'charity' and it was linked with usurious rates of interest. The money invested by the outside elements demanded returns. Land alienation was the direct result of this 'investment'. Many Santhals lost their land in deal. Accounts were tampered with and rates of interest were inflated. Besides, many such documents were nothing but legal fiction. The local officials and their British patrons sided with landlords and other exploiters. The Santhal grew more and more disillusioned with the official machineiy and courts of law which were only helping their exploiters.

THE economic exploitation of Santhals crossed all limits and it became unbearable. Two daring and gallant men, Kanu and Siddha Murmu, came forward to fulfil the need of the hour.

AFTER getting the required leadership, the Santhals mobilised themselves for mass action. On a sultiy and sweltering day of June, 1855 they assembled in thousands and took a vow to free themselves from the yoke of exploitation. All the outside elements, especially the government servants, landlords, moneylenders and British warned to leave the area and flee for their lives at were once.

THE first phase of rebellion consisted of stray killings. Dozens of moneylenders and police official were attacked and killed. Then markets and shops owned by the outsiders were ransacked and looted and wherever they encountered any resistance, they fought with their poisoned arrows, swords, and spears. The administration, sensing the gravity of situation sent top civil servants to persuade the Santhals to abandon their violent struggle and sort out the problems through peaceful means but it was too late. The Santhal fury was in full swing. They was bent upon erasing every symbol of British rule. They ran sacked offices, killed every British soul they came across, including Women and children and attacked the houses and establishments of Indian stooges of British rulers. At last the army was ordered to crush the rebellion at any cost. Several Santhal villages were plundered and set on fire by the army. After some time the entire leadership of Santhal rebellion was arrested and the rebellion subsided by the end of year 1856.

DIFFERENT historians have interpreted this historical rebellion in different ways. The following passage from Thompson and Garratts'

Rise and Fulfilment of British Rule in India describe it is an interesting way ignoring the role of British rule in the shameless economic exploitation of the Santhals which culminated in the armed uprising.

"Inside India, the Santhal rebellion 1855, at the time was taken potent and aroused much of the alarm and savagery of repression which were to blaze out less than two years later. The Santhal aborigines, who in a state of nature live by chase, a people ofextreme simplicity and loveableness, were suffering from Hindu infiltration. as

THIS meant change of habit and whole train of perplexities. Their hands became alienated, they were entangled in debts to people far cleverer than themselves. They were under foolish local officials who would not help them. The facile reply that the Santhals should appeal to the civil courts, or prove their charges of oppression before criminal courts, was the answer of the father who should offer his son a stone when he asked for bread.... Then, without warning, a Santhal inundation swept over outlying regions of Bengal, reaching to within a hundred miles of Calcutta, cleaving upon skulls of European and Indian alike, pouring out poisoned arrows, burning huts and bungalows. All ended however as it was bound to end, in massacre and executions. "

REV.W.J. Culshaw, emphasising the importance of land and forest in tribal economy strongly observed that alienation of land on a large scale with the tacit approval of British administrators was the main reason/ for this rebellion. He writes:

"The most powerful motive ofsanthals life is the possession of land which they till... no motive is so strong in ribalpeople as the preservation of the life of the tribes and its mores...and a santhaVs land not only provides economic security but it is a powerful link with his ancestors: and this applies to newly entered no less than old, for they will not take possession till the spirits approve. The land is apart of his spiritual as well as his economic heritage. "

EVEN Karl Marx todk cognizance of the Santhal rebellion. Commenting on the rebellion in his Notes on Indian History, he observed that the rebellion could be crushed in 1856 after a guerilla war of seven months. One of the greatest Bangla poets Tagore has also paid handsome tributes to the heroes of this rebellion. Although, it was crushed decisively, yet it still inspires thousands of Santhals

who derive a lot of moral force through the legends connected with the uprising,

# MUNDA Rebellion

THE Munda uprising is another grand example of tribal resistance against all-pervading exploitation and tyranny. The Munda is one of the main tribes of Chotanagpur region and numerically one of the important tribes of India.

LIKE the neighbouring Santhals, the Mundas too owned the land collectively. Till early nineteenth centuiy, they were leading a peaceful life within their traditional social and political structures under which the chieftain or Sardar enjoyed powerful position. After some time, due to factional fights among the Mundas, some of their areas came under the authority of the adjoining Hindu princely states, bringing them into intimate culture contacts with the Hindu royalty. The Munda chiefs, in order to raise themselves in Hindu esteem, started adopting rituals and customs of the Hindus. Further, they started patronising and pampering the Hindu priests who were donated laige tracts of land. With the passage of time, these priests assumed all the traits of landlords. Under the impact of ever increasing pressure of population the demand for cultivable land escalated and consequently the revenue was also enhanced. The poor Munda cultivators, who were obtaining only meagre yield from the difficult soil under the primitive conditions of agriculture were not in a position to pay the enhanced revenue. This situation put them directly at the mercy of cunning moneylenders who exploited them to their utmost advantage. When the British nilers established their dominance, they approved almost all the existing rules and customs in entirety. Misra and Tiwari (1975) further reinforce this description by telling us that in the year 1806, the British rulers allowed all the powers of police to the landlords.\*

THE tacit approval of British rulers to the exploitation of the Munda masses aroused popular discontent and the word diku became the symbol of address for all outside elements. The ferment continued and gave rise to sporadic clashes in the early nineteenth century. In all these clashes, the British rulers sided with the oppressors of the Munda masses and gave effective help in suppressing them ruthlessly. Disillusioned with their plight, the Mundas inclined towards missionaries and embraced Christianity in lai^e number on the Msurance "that after conversion, their rights shall be restored and interests safeguarded. Contrary to their hopes, the missionaries did not side with them at the hour of need. Their disillusionment was complete.

A Charismatic Munda, called Birsa, emerged on the scene and took over the leadership. An energetic and dashing youth of twenty, Birsa got his education in a mission school and thereafter he lived with a Hindu ascetic of Vaishnav sect. He announced that he had been sent by God to secure the emancipation of the Munda from the diku (outsiders) and to deliver goods for the upliftment of the Munda. Some of his friends connived with him in the perpetuation of the myth regarding his superhuman powers. He start^ preaching throughout the length and breadth of Chotanagpur region. His preachings were a mixture of Hinduism, Christianity and Mundane politics. He call^ upon Mundas to give up rituals and to believe in one God. This appealed to the masses who were fed up with expensive rituals of offering sacrifices of animals to a multiplicity of gods. Like the missionaries, he also arranged prayer meetings or congregations where he preached the people that they should shed the fear of bullets and guns, because due to his superhuman and supernatural powers the worldly arms and ammunition would not be able to injure them.

BY THE year 1895, he was able to collect a dedicated band of about six thousand Mundas. His chief aim was to finish the political dominance of the British, drive out all outside elements and establish independent Munda state. Now the uprising started and under a pre-planned strategy the landlords, missionaries, officials and all outsiders were attacked. Fierce fighting followed but the Mundas could not gain decisive victory. Meanwhile Birsa, now known as Birsa Bhagwan (god Birsa) was captured and lodged in Ranchi jail. After some months, Birsa was released but he did not give up the path of confrontation. He went undeiground and made preparation for another uprising. The Christmas day of 1897 was fixed up as the opportune time when all the establishments of missionaries and landlords were attacked. This time, even Christian Mundas were not spared. Police stations were the special targets of the rebels. When the situation went out of hands, army contingents were dispatched from Ranchi to crush the rebellion. Predictably, the Munda rebels had to bow before the modem weaponry and ruthless precision of the army. Birsa and his close associate Gaya Munda were captured and lodged in Ranchi jail where the charismatic leader died of disease. The death of Birsa sounded the death knell of the heroic struggle of the tribals against oppression and economic exploitation. After the revolt was put down, it was decided to take steps to provide protection to tribals against exploitation by non-tribals. "The inception of settlement and survey operations in Ranchi district was thus a direct outcome of the Birsa Movement" (Dhebar Commission, 1961). as

# NAGA RebeUion

THE north-eastern hill areas of India have also been a centre of tribal unrest and uprisings. This region is inhabited by tribes who have not learnt to surrender before any established authority. They are so much fieedom-loving and autonomy oriented that their resistance could not be crushed even by two hundred years of firm British rule. The Naga and Mizo rebellions are two of the important examples of a long series of armed rebellions on the north-eastern fringe of India.

THE present Nagaland lies on the extreme north-eastern fringe of Indi^ adjacent to Burma. Designated as Naga Hills during the British administration, it was for long one of the least accessible regions of India. Beyond the Naga Hills district lay a tribal area over which the government of India did not exercise any effective control. "Survey parties have penetrated some parts of that unadministrated tribal area, but their work had remained fragmentary and large scale maps of survey of India still showed several white patches" (Haimendorf, 1976).

THE State of Nagaland is inhabited by numerous Naga tribes such' as Angami Naga, Ao Naga, Sengma Naga, Konyak Naga etc. Despite their poverty and economic backwardness, they are proud of their cultural heritage. Shifting cultivation, locally known as jhum, is their source of livelihood. Traditionally, the Naga tribes do not bow before anybody's authority, in some cases not even their chieftain's. The Nagas resisted the British onslaughts for a long time and after a century of repression and bloody struggle the British empire could establish any semblance of authority in Naga Hills only in year 1885. As usual the area was thrown open to different shade of missionaries who did pioneering work in spreading literacy and providing them basic medical amenities. The practice of head hunting, a symbol of social prestige, was discontinued but the bloody warfare and vendetta which had taken deep roots among them could not be subdued. To acknowledge defeat, even against much stronger opponent, without offering stiff and bloody resistance, is against the veiy nat?iie of brave Naga. They had also fought, before British rulere, Mughal and Ahom empires for interfering with their freedom. Till the initial decades of 20th century, they had been fighting with their traditional weaponsspears, swords, bows and arrows-but they entered the era of firearms much earlier, as compared to the other tribes of India. mam

THIS happened during the second World war when the Japanese army had surrounded Kohima and Japanese soldiers had infiltrated deep into Naga territory. While retreating, the Japanese soldiere left vast quantities of arms and ammunition behind. The familiarity of present Naga rebels with the fire arms and modem techniques of guerilla warfare is the direct result of this experience.

AFTER India attained independence and Nagaland alongwith other tracts of north eastern hill area became a part of Indian Union, a concerted move was undertaken by the overambitious and the politicised section of the Nagas to secede from India and form an independent country. The seeds of this separatism were probably laid when Charles Pawsey, Deputy Commissioner of Kohima in 1945, established the Naga Hills District Tribal Council to unite the Nagas in the task of reconstruction after the war. "A small newspaper called, significantly. The Naga Nation was published and later The Naga Herald, subsequently banned in 1953. Zapu Phizo himself and most of the Phizo's top lieutenants to seem originally to have been initiated into politics by Pawsey. The mentorship of Pawsey was so effective apparently, that in June, 1947 Phizo was able to declare boldly that the Naga Hills would cease to be a part of India after India's independence. "Before he made his declaration behind the scene parleys between the British authorities in india and their principals in London are said to have favoured a future for the Nagas separate from the rest of India" (Rakshat Puri, 1972). Briefly, in monuis that followed, an agreement was arrived at between Sir Akbar Hyadarithe governor, and Assam's Chief Minister Gopinath Bardoloi, on the hand, and the Naga National Council led by Phizo on the other, the last clause of which was interpreted by the Nagas to mean that they would have the choice of separation after ten years. Official statements made it clear that this was not so. Pandit Nehru in his characteristic way, described the Naga demand as "unwise, impracticable and unacceptable" one

PHIZO and his followers, well versed in guerilla warfare, took to the jungle and the rebellion for secession from India started in a systematic way. It continued unabated for a decade or so with full support of Naga masses who were providing all sorts of assistance and shelters to the insurgents against the security forces of India. Meanwhile the state of Nagaland came into being in 1962 and this satisfied a considerable section of politically conscious Naga people. Commenting on the deterioration of relations between the Nagas and the Government of India after 1952 onwards, M Alemchibha Ao,

himself a Nag^, says that the main cause that led to unfortunate conflict was Government's lack of knowledge of the tribes and their failure to appreciate the basic requirements of the hill men (1972).

THE rebel Phizo, apprehending arrest, took to exile and settled in ^ndon and his followers back home formed a government in exile the difficult terrains and jungles of Nagaland and adjoining Burma and the erstwhile East-Pakistan. They formed their own army, parliament, cabinet, courts, etc. The Naga rebels also got training, arms, money and political support from the countries unfriendly to India, especially China and Pakistan. in

DISILLUSIONED with the secessionist movement, increasing number of Nagas started turning to the constitutionally elected State Government and its democratic institutions. Seeing their movements petering, out the rebel Nagas struck against with full ferocity in 1972, just after the elections through which a new government had come into being. The security forces of India also retaliated with full force. Many underground insuigents were flushed out, a vast area was intensively combed, oiganizations sympathetic to rebels were banned and many persons suspected to be harbouring the rebels were arrested and tortured. Gradually the new wave of insurgency subsided but did not end.

THE Gove.Timent of India has no doubt shown utmost restraint in dealiiig with the insurgency in Nagaland. On the administrative front, massive amount of money have been invested on a variety of developmental activities and for providing them gainful employments. All such schemes are being implemented through Naga people themselves. They form their own government on the basis of adult franchise. The result of this attitude has started bearing fruits. The rebels have almost been isolated and they are able to show their presence and defiance only through sporadic cases of ambush government officials and convoys of security forces. The indigenous Christian missionaries have undertaken the mission of reclaiming their tribal flock to the Indian nation unlike the foreign missionaries who were either indifferent or instigating the Christian Naga to secede from India. It is a great tribute to the dedication and zeal of the Chr istian missionaries that the literacy among many of these tribes is much higher than the average in the rest of the country. on

THE so-called "separatist" tendencies among the Nagas and other north-eastern tribes were initially only natural attempts on their part to define their socio-cultural identity vis-a-vis others in new circumstances of independence. "For most tribes in north-eastern hill areas the experience of being integral part of nation is relatively recent and their difficulty in quickly and unqualifyingly accepting this fact needs to be sympath^Cally leviewed. "(Srinivas and Sanwal, 1972). To some other anthropologists a great deal of what is happening in north-eastern hill areas today, can be related to the tribal elite's fear of losing their cultural identities in the ocean of Hindu nationalism. Thus, attempts to produce cultural uniformity and integration though induced assimilation can be dangerous. India has always being heterogeneous in terms of race, language, religion and cuiture. The essence of Indian unity lies in diversity, and any attempt towards uni y to succeed must be in the framework of this cultural, religious and ethnic pluralism.

CONCLUDING one may say that the present problem with the Naga is not economic though economic steps for their betterment have certainly diffused the situation to a great extent. It is political problem and needs a political solution.

## MIZO Rebellion

THE unrest and uprising among the Mizos is another example of simmering tribal unrest and discontent on the far north-eastern fringe of India. There is hardly any need to dilate on the nature of the threat that a weak, strife-tom and isolated northeast spells for India.

THE Lushais constitute an important tribe inhabiting the Lushai hills adjacent to Bangla Desh and Burma. Traditionally, the Lushai people call their place of habitation as Mizoram and hence the inhabitants of Mizoram are called Mizos. They are as much alienated from the rest of India as those of Naga Hills, thanks largely to inaccessibility and lack of communication in an area many points of which are linked only by helicopter. This isolation of tribals was further accentuated by the advent of the Western Christian missionaries in the region. Backed and protected by British administration, these missionaries converted the tribal to Christianity in large numbers and 'reclaimed' them to civilization, but in the process raised yet another wall, cultural and religious. Educational and medical facilities were extended to far flung areas for the first time and rnany of the missionaries served them with dedication and compassion. They were assured a better future if they embraced Christian religion. Being satisfied with such assurance, they cooperated with British authorities. It is on record that about three hundred Mizo headmen extended all sorts of help to the British rulers when the Japanese army attacked Assam during the Second World War.

LIKE the/Na^ rebellion the nature of Mizo uprising, too is highly political. Unlike the Santhals and Munda rebellions, it was not the result of exploitation by the outside elements backed by British authorities. Accustomed to free life Mizos did not like any political interference from any side. They resorted to guerilla warfare whenever an attempt was made to put them under any political authority except their own. The geographical and ecological conditions like deep forests and difficult mountainous terrain, further encouraged their defiant temperament. They live under geographical conditions ideal for guerilla resistance. Burning with political ambitions and instigated by the unfriendly China and Pakistan, the Mizo leadership raised the banner of revolt just after India attained independence and they were put under the political authority of Indian Union. ^

THE demand for "Mizoland" and for single entity comprising the hill districts of Assam around Shillong, were originally one movement, and the movement was for a separate state, not for separation from the countiy. It took shape in 1954, with the formation of Eastern India, Tribal Union subsequently giving shape to the All Party Hill Leaders' Conference. "There followed the usual cycle of verbal assurance from New Delhi, unexplained delays, and obstruction by interests-usually Assamese-opposed to the aspirations of the hill leaders and their followers "(Rakshat Puri, 1972). In the process, elements in the Assam Congress Party are said to have attempted to divide the hill leaders by supporting the dissidents Mizos, who were apparently encouraged to form a Mizo National Front, under the leadership of Laldenga. This move spiralled into secessionist movement and the Mizo National Front began to demand complete separation from India and mounted a guerilla terrorist campaign to make the demand effective.

IN April, 1970 was created a new state of Meghalaya out of Assam. The hill leaders were satisfied so is the case with their followers the Khasi, Garo and Jaintia peoples. To fulfil the political aspiration of the Mizo, Mizoram was declared a Union Territoiy—independent of Assam alongwith Aruhachal Pradesh reorganising the state of Assam in 1971 under the North-Eastern Areas (Reoiganisation) Act, 1971. However the guerilla warfare continued though officials sources claimed success in a programme of resettlement of Mizo villagers. "The Mizos were regarded as good soldiers when the British were in India. Many of hard-core guerillas are said to be demobilized soldiers who fought in Burma campaign during the Second World

War, and who have not been able to find gainful employments in the hills and have no access to the opportunities elsewhere in the country." (Rakshat Puri, ibid).

FOR some time Laldenga remained underground in the hill with his government in exile and led the movement from hidings. But later opted to go to West Germany and London to mobilize support for his demands. In the absence of Laldenga from the scene disillusionment grew among the large sections of his followersguerillas and non-guerilla Mizos— and they started cooperating with the constitutionally elected government of Mizoram and various institutions of the democratic government. The Indian security forces too made the lives of successionists miserable and demoralization started settling in. Meanwhile the Government of India pumped massive doses of developments grants to this tiny Union Territory. The seventies witnessed fast pace of spread of education, medical facilities and employment opportunities. The popularity of Laldenga and the secessionist movement led by him declined appreciably but the hard-core and the dedicated section of the Mizos remained sympathetic to their leader and the movement. Acknowledging the potentiality of such a situation, the Government of India once more opened the door of peaceful settlement and invited Laldenga from West Germany with "the guarantee that he will be provided free and safe passage out of India in case the talks failed. The delicate parleys continued for more than a year in New Delhi in 1981 and the first half of 1982. Finding itself helpless before the rigid attitude of Laldenga, the government terminated the talks, and allowed Laldenga to go wherever he liked: In this way the Government of India honoured its promise.

ALTHOUGH, the extremist section of Mizo National Front continued the guerilla was face but its intensity declined to a great extant. Declining support of the Mizo masses, the emei^ence of Bangla Desh in place the erstwhile East Pakistan dealt a serious blow to the whole movement. While the growing disillusionment of the people deprived the gurillas of their mass base, the dismemberment of Pakistan also deprived them of the strategic support. Later an accord was reached with the Mizo National Front, Laldenga became chief minister of Mizoram, elections were heli he ruled for a while and died of Cancer. Rest is History.

# Tribal Discontent and Uprising in Other Areas

THE Koyas of Agency Districts of Andhra repeatedly revolted against the British authorities. In the later phase a systematic guerilla warfare

was waged under the leadership of the famous Alluri SitaRam Raju who harassed the British authorities at the time when Indian National Congress was waging Non-Cooperation Movement against the alien rule.

THE Bastar rebellion of 1911, Kurichia unrest and the Naga struggle under the leadership of Rani Guidalo may be treated as the contributions of our tribal people to our freedom struggle. Tantiya Bhil, Vishnu Gond, Kangia Manji etc. were not modem Robinhood but dedicated oiganizers of struggle against oppressions of alien rule.

THE communist parties and their peasant fronts have also done a lot in organising the suppressed and oppressed tribals to fight for their rights. The former shifting cultivators, Warlis of Western India have, since 1964, became part and parcel of the region's peasant movement.

L.K. MAHAPATRA (1972) describing the role of peasant organizations led by different shades of communist parties tells that in Koraput district, the local Konds have joined a rather localised tribal organisation run by communist workers which claim solidarity with ail the Adivasis and all the proletariats of the world. In recent years the Saora and other tribal groups in Vishakapatnam Agency of Andhara Pradesh have taken up arms under extremist communist leadership to fight against their exploiting landlords, middlemen and dispossessors of their land. Similarly move was already reported earlier among the Naxalbari tribesmen. Though the Naxalbari movement was not basically a tribal movement, the oppressed tribals constituted an important segment of its landless supporters who showed to the world that they were no more prepared to allow their bloodsuckers and usurpers of their rights to carry on their activities unresisted. There is, therefore, a current trend of initiating armed movements among the tribes seeking to tie their fate not only with other tribes, but with other peasants and have nots of India. us

## Reasons for Tribal Discontent Elsewhere

DISCONTENT and unrest in tribal areas is the cumulative result of a number of contributory factors. Following are the main factors responsible for this state of affairs:

- 0) harshness of the forest laws and regulations and the lack of sympathy and understanding in administering them;
- (ii) utter inadequacy of the credit facilities to combat tribal indebtedness;

- (Hi) inability of protective halation to prevent the passing of tribal lands into the hands of non-tribals;
- (iv) ineffectiveness of the measures taken to rehabilitate the tribal population displacedfrom their -homes following large scale acquisition of tribal land required for irrigation, hydro-electric and other projects;
  - (v) delay in implementation of important recommendations made by high level bodies; and
  - (vi) discrimination in the implementation of salutary measures like aboltion of the Muttadari system—a system more oppressive than Zamindari—in Agency Areas ofAndhra and Orissa.

THE Shilu Ao Report (1969) has indicted the present day administrators and bureaucracy for their lethargy and indifference dealing with the grievances of the tribals. Appreciating the dynamism of British administrators responsible for tribal areas, it comments that although, for want of communications, the conditions of touring were far more difficult than they are today and malaria was rampant in the hills, it was usual for the Collector or Agent to tour continuously for three or four weeks in the agency areas, meeting tribals in conference, listening to their grievances and dispensing justice. That salutary practice is no longer followed by the present day administrators. Thus, in Srikakulam, where the tribal discontent had taken a violent turn. The Shilu Ao team was told that the Agent had Spent only two days in the agency areas in 1966. With malaria almost completely eradicated and communications vastly improved, it should be possible for the district officers to tour the agency areas more intensively than they do at present. The only impact of flying tours, undertaken by those officers in cars and jeeps, on the tribal areas is the stink of petrol they leave behind. There is now a complete lack of rapport between the officers and the tribal population.

THE above example is enough to prove the indifference and apathy of the officers responsible for the upliftment of the tribal population. Less apparent in its immediate effect but far reaching in its impact is the attitude of paternalism we have adopted all along in our relations with the tribals. The Shilu Ao Committee Report had made some significant observations in this regard. It remarks that conscious of the rectitude of our intentions, we are apt to delude ourselves into the belief that the feeling of the tribal to the efforts we are making on his behalf to raise his living standards will be one of appreciation

and gratitude, forgetting that in a developing society, however primitive, the position does not remain static, and that the reaction of emerging class of educated tribals to such an attitude is likely to be one of the resentment and even hostility. Political consciousness is a corollary to socio-economic development and when you educate a tribal you cannot insulate him from the political currents sweeping through the country and beyond.

THE causes of tribal unrest may be either agrarian, political economic or an amalgam of all the three in varying proportions. In Assam, which even before independence had an educated elite in its hill districts, blindness to signs of political unrest as revealed by the persistent failure to give their enlightened representatives an adequate share in the governance of the State appears to have been the proximate cause for growing feeling that the full development of their personality and for the fulfilment of their political aspirations, they should free themselves from the dominance of the plainsmen who had persistently refused to treat them as equals. The movement of succession thus, had its origin in the revolt of the intelligentsia against a position of tutelage which offended their sense of self respect. The Jharkhand movement among the tribes of Bihar may also be put in this category. or socio-

IT IS high time that we modify our present approach and begin to treat the tribals not as perpetual wards but as equals and partners in progress. Partnership, not paternalism, is the answer. The remedy for political unrest lies in a readiness to understand and even to anticipate the political aspirations of the tribals and in a willingness to meet them before the aspirations assume the character of secessionist movement which will not be serving the interest of the tribals either in the longrun. We shall have to shed our attitude of pity for the tribals backward and miserable people deserving our help and sympathy to come at par with the rest of the population. as
