# FOREST, TRIBALS, AND FOREST POLICY

# Chapter 14

I

![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg)

THE Tribal people eveiywhere have lived in intimate relationship with forests and their entire existence has been linked with forests due to historical factors. Forests have been sustaining their inhabitants. In fact there existed a ^symbiotic relationship' between the tribals and the forests. Forests have been their abode and source of livelihood. Thus, it has been a unanimously held view that forest economy is tribal economy and vice versa.

NOT only their economic life but the religious and religio-magical beliefs of the tribal people have been rotating round the forests. Many a flora and fauna have been their objects of worship (Totems). Thus, the tribal people were abje to achieve such a harmony that has always been a matter of envy for the non-tribals.

IN THE mid 19th centuiy the importance of relationship between wildlife and botanical wealth and soil, moisture, rainfall and general environment was realised and it was decided to extend the authority of the state to the hitherto neglected parts of the territory. Following gradual extension of states' authority the 'lords' and 'masters' of forests were continually put under lot of pressures and inconveniences. Following is the chronicled narration of evolution of forest policy alongwith various measures taken by the state to manage the forests.

## The First Forest Act of 1865:

THIS Act was the first attempts in the direction of regulation of collection of forest produce by the forest dwellers. In the process, the socially regulated practices of the local people were restrained by law.

# The Forest Act of 1878:

THIS was the second step in the direction of further extension of states' authority over forests. The control over forests was further tightened by prohibiting certain acts such as trespass or pasturing of cattle and declaring certain activities, as forest offences. Imprisonment and fines were also prescribed for these offences.

# The First Forest Policy 1894:

THE First Forest Policy envisaged, for the first time, the regulation of rights and restriction of privileges of the users in the forests. These regulations and restrictions were justified only when the advantages to be gained by the general public were great and the cardinal principles observed i.e., the rights and the privileges of individuals must be limited in the laiger public interests. It is to be noted here that it was only in 1894 that the forest officials seriously appeared on the scene and claimed the authority to limit and regulate the traditional tribal rights over forests.

## The Indian Forest Act 1927:

IN CONTINUATION of the measures already taken, this act was an attempt to regulate further people's rights over forest land and forest produce. Through this act, elaborate provisions were made in the direction of further extension of states' authority and control over the forests. Forest offences were defined as offences punishable under the act. This Act created an extremely powerful and adequately protected executive consisting of Forest Officers of Indian Forest Service, State Forest Service, Rangers, Foresters, and Forest Guards. This Act gave the powers to the executive to make rules which were not necessarily permanent in nature. These officers enjoyed legal powers. For example Section 64 of Indian Forest Act states that any Forest Officer without a warrant could arrest any person against whom a 'reasonable' suspicion exists of his motive to pilferage forest or forest wealth and his act was punishable with imprisonment for one month or upwards. Section 68 deals with power, to compound the offences while Section 70 deals with the power to seize and impound the cattle of the offender under Cattle Trespass Act 1871.

SUCH provisions, as stated above, made even some of the lower level officials of forest department like Rangers and Forest Guards veiy strong. Since it is these officials who regularly come in contact with the forest dwellers, they used their power arbitrarily and played havoc with the lives of the tribal people. The story of their interaction with the tribals is replete with the instances in which these officials claimed indemnity for acts done in good faith according to Section 74 and got away. It further states that no suit shall be against a public servant for acts done in good faith and that all forest officials are deemed public servants. In 1935 Forest was transferred to the state list according to the Government of India Act 1935.

# The National Forest Policy 1952:

WHEN the post independence India formulated its first National Forest Policy in 1952, it belied all hopes of a just and generous treatment of the tribal people. It followed, by and laige, the limes of the British administration where the tribals had virtually no statutory right but enjoyed only certain concessions/privileges such as right to take water for agricultural purposes, digging of wells and canals for agricultural purposes, free grazing in open forests,., removal of timber, bamboos, reeds, canes, etc. for construction and repair of houses and for agricultural implements, collection of dead word for domestic use as fuel, collection of grass for cattle and for thatching their huts, fishing and hunting excluding the protected fauna and cultivation of forest land.

THE President of India under the Article 339 of the Constitution of India appointed a commission in 1960 under the chairmanship of late UN Dheber, popularly known as Dhebar Commission. In its comprehensive analysis it also studied the forest policy vis-a-vis tribals. The Commission noted that the tribals who had hitherto treated himself as the lord of the forest was made subservient to the forest department. The traditional rights of the tribals were no longer recognised as rights. "In 1894 they became rights and privileges and in 1952 they became rights and concessions. Now they are being considered as concessions only."

## The Recommendations of N.C.A. -1976 and Tribal Rights

THE Commission recommended a drastic reduction in the people's rights over forests and forest produce. It was stated that the free supply of the forest produce to the local people and their rights and privileges have brought destruction to the forests so it is necessary to reverse the process. The local people have not contributed much towards the maintenance or regulation of the forests. The Commission recommended strengthening of the forest legislation by the enactment of a revised All India Forest Act. The recommendations of the Commission were rejected by the Forest Ministers Conference in 1982. In 1976, the Forests subject was brought in to the concurrent list through the Constitution 42nd amendment empowering the Centre to make laws. Consequently, the Forest Conservation ordinance was promulgated in October 1980. Later, it was passed by the Parliament and became an act.

# **B.K. Roy Burman Committee on Forests** and Tribals

THE Ministry of Home Affairs under the Chairmanship of Prof. B.K. Roy Burman, an eminent anthropologist appointed a committee in 1980 to re-orient the forest policy to serve the tribal economy. The Committee submitted its report in 1982. It emphasised the importance of forests in tribal life. Besides getting free fuel, fodder and wood for house construction the tribals also earn one third of their income from the sale of the Minor Forest Produce.

THE Committee noted that the forest operations, by and large, are the revenue earners for the Government. The tribal economy has figured little among the parameters of the forest policy and, at best, the tribals continue to be the wage earners. The Committed pointed out that the benefits should flow to the tribal people through the imaginative forestry programmes and conservation and recognition of their traditional skills. In other words, the individual tribal, the local tribal community and national interest should be regarded as the three corners of a triangular forest policy. Forest policy must fulfill three sets of needs. These are a) ecological security, b) food, fruit, c) fuel, fodder and other domestic needs of particularly the rural and tribal population.

THE Committee also recommended that wherever the community rights exist on the forest land they should be recognised and adapted to serve the urgent needs of the soil and water management and reafforestation of tracts by suitable species.

# National Committee on Development of Backward Areas (1980)

THE Planning Commission appointed a committee on development of backward areas in 1980. The Committee followed the view expressed by the National Commission on Agriculture and recommended for the curtailment of the rights of the tribal communities over the forest land and forest produce.

THE Committee was of the view that the rights in the forest could be sustained only if there was a comprehensive frame for the protection, use and development of forests in which the community and the individual must assume the responsibility for creation of the new forestry wealth and its protection.

THE Committee further pointed out that the Minor Forest Produce should not be treated as source of revenue for the state but it should

#### 262 \_ TRIBAL INDIA ^

provide maximum return to the tribal so that the economic interests created in the maintenance of forests with the possibility of sustained income accruing to the individual regularly from its collection. All leases for collection and marketing of Minor Forest Produce should go to the cooperatives of tribals.

## The Committee For Review of Rights and Concessions -1980

raE Ministry of Agriculture constituted a Committee to review the li^^d concessions of tribal under the chairmanship of Shri M.S. ChittM%, the former Chief Secretaiy of Madhya Pradesh in 1961. All other members of the Committee were the former forest officials.

THE Committee observed that the concessions and privileges granted to the tribals in respect of fuelwood, timber, grazing, etc. were confined only to the villages in and around the peripheiy of the forest areas and generally only in respect of non-reserved forests. The rights, privileges and concessions in areas not under the British rule were mostly undefined. The Commission recommended that the exercise of rights and concessions should be restricted only to those tribals and other rural people residing within the distance of 8 K.M. from the existing forests.

THE Committee also recommended that the beneficiaries should not enter the forest to remove the forest produce and that the supplies should be made available through the departmental depots opened outside the forest for this purpose. It also recommended that the barter or the sale of the produce obtained through such concessions should be stopped. The Committee further stated that the total quantum of rights Md concessions be restricted to what the forests can bear. The Committee also recommended that the grazing of cattle in the forests should be severely restricted to the carrying capacity of the forest

# New National Forest Policy -1980 and The Tribal Rights

IT STATES that the principal aim of the forest policy must be ensure enviroimental stability and the maintenance of ecological balance including atmospheric equilibrium, which are vital to the sustenance of all life forms - human, animal and plant The derivation of the economic benefit must be subordinated to the principal aim. to

ONE of the striking features of the new forest policy is its reference to the relationship of the tribal communities with the forests. It states

that having regard to the symbiotic relationship between the tribal people and the forests, a primaiy task of all the agencies responsible for the forest management including the forest corporations should be to associate the tribal closely in the protection, regeneration, and development of forests as well as to provide gainful employment to the people living in and around the forest While safeguarding the customary rights and interests of such people the forestiy programmes should pay special attention to the following:

- I. To reduce the illegal cutting and for the exploitation of the forest the contractors should be replaced by the forest corporations, labour cooperatives and the tribal cooperatives.
- 2. Special attention should be paid to the protection, regeneration and optimum collection of the minor forest produce along with institutional arrangements for its marketing.
- 3. Family oriented schemes for improving the status of the tribal beneficiaries.
- 4. Integrated area development programmes to meet the needs of the tribal economy in and around the forest areas.

THE above mentioned provisions are some of the important provisions of the new forest policy with regards to the tribals.

AS FAR AS the rights and concessions enjoyed by the tribals the new forest policy categorically stated that the rights and concessions enjoyed by them should be fully protected. Their domestic requirements of fuelwood, fodder, minor forest produce and construction of timber should be allowed to be fulfilled throu^ forest produce. This is the most welcome feature since it emphasises the needs of the forest dwellers for the first time since the forest administration began in India (the draft of this policy is enclosed in the annexure (XVIII) part of this book).

## Forest Conservation Act -1980 Vs. Forest Policy 1988

RECENTLY, the Central Government has brought some amendments in the Forest Conservation Act 1980 which are almost in contravention with the National Forest Policy 1988.

UNDER these amendments the state governments cannot, without previous sanction of the centre, assign by way of lease or otherwise any forest land or any portion thereof to any person or to any authority, corporation, agency or any other oiganization not owned, controlled or managed by the Government (Sec.2a). This goes against

the provisions of the forest policy resolution that wherever possible, degraded lands should be made available for tree fanning on either lease or on the basis of a \*Tree patta scheme\*\*. The provision in the amendment specifically dis-allows the lease to any non-government agency except with the prior approval of the Central Government This restricts the giving of degraded land to the tribal cooperatives and oi^anisations for the purpose of afforestation.

ANOTHER amendment in the forest conservation act is the offering of the explanation regarding the non-forest purpose. This explanation is very restrictive. The forest department cannot allow the use of forest land by the individuals or oiganisations even for horticultural crops or medicinal plants. The provisions cover all forest lands including degraded lands. These provisions are bound to raise hostilities amongst the tribals and the Government. The recently appointed committee by the Prime Minister and the Parliament should pass the revised comprehensive forest act in tune with the National Forest Policy resolution.

## Destruction of the Forest Environment and The Tribal

PRIOR to the advent of the British rule, the iforests remained communal property with no individual staking any claim to them. Individuals had resource to the forest for their needs and protected them as their natural heritage.

FOR the forest dweller-the tribal-the forests remained his life blood, the symbiotic relationship of the forest and the tribal constituted the foundation of his independence. The mutual interdependence as the basis of his relative seclusion was an expression of his independence from the outside world for his survival.

FOR the British, the forests were the treasure groves and with one stroke of the executive pen, the colonial administration took over the vast forests in the name of the people. The guardians of the forest then set-out to exploit its natural wealth. The people of the forests were^'now aliens or intruders on the state property. But they were undisturbed from their habitat since they provided cheap labour by which the forests could be cut, the timber, thus, removed could serve the colonial interests. The forests began to be felled and the timber hauled to the distant markets.

THE Forest Policy of 1952 with minor changes continued in essence as laid down by the colonial rulers. The revenue from the forest

exploitation was increasing year after year. The profit of the state turned out to be the doom for the tribal. For him the relationship with the forests meant more than food, fuel, fibre and fodder and w^ closely related to their survival. The satisfaction of their basic needs was considered as illegal and attracted penalty. Their symbiotic relationship was never understood properly. Their proximity to the forests encouraged their use as forest labour. This helped their rapid alienation from the forest. Their survival was increasingly put in jeopardy by the contractor, moneylender combine; they provide cheap labour and a safe cover for illegal felling.

UNWILLINGLY, due to his innocence, the tribal became a tool for his own destruction. His hunger for land pushed him into cleaning fresh areas for encroachments. His encroachments resulted in the low productivity due to the impoverishment of soil nutrients since the soils exposed and got eroded. were

THE importance of forests for mining and canying construction of multipurpose projects, thermal projects, and industries depending on the ore's availability in forest areas and the preservation of wildlife made the government to dispossess the tribals land. This resulted in the dislocation of the traditional habitats of the tribals ruining their traditional economy and driving them to the fringes of the urban or industrial areas ultimately living as paupers at the mercy of the anti-social elements. Often the compensation was meagre. The tribals who were affected were illiterate. They did not know the laws. Since their land was held under the traditional rights and in the interior of the forests, they did not have legal documents to prove their titles, their lands were never surveyed. Their titles were never registered. The customary rights of the tribals over their land is in the form of community ownership. They have no record of rights. Even while recording their rights they get dispossessed.: Wrongly recording the chief as the owner and not as the manager of their common property was another reason. The government while recording the rights looks for the records and no general rights on a community basis are recognised.

DUE to the continued land alienation from whatever ancestral lands the tribal cultivated, he slowly lost the consciousness of the fact that the jungle was his security. Therefore, he had little stakes for the protection and preservation of the forest. Neither he resisted^ the destruction nor he visualised the preservation. In the name of the scientific forest management the fruit trees, the medicine trees were fit for fuelwood only, and hence were replaced by monoculture such

as teak and eucalyptus plantations which are almost of no use to the . tribals or support any wildlife.

THE Government of India report on the Himalayas in 1959 said, "The Himalayan forests, for instance, are the greatest national asset and to them we owe the richness of the country. The denudation of the Himalayan slopes leads to a greater intensity and frequency of floods, cause recurrent erosion, and to cause detritus being deposited in the fertile sub-mountain tracts. The process inflicts immeasurable loss and misery on the unsuspecting millions in the Indo-Gangetic plain, and brings about the progressive and permanent impairment of soil fertility and the cumulative reduction in the agricultural potential of the whole land."

THIS is a self professing doom. But with the deforestation which has reduced the tree cover by over 60% we have,

- 1. Floods : The flooding area has doubled from 1971 to 1981 and an annual loss of over Rs. 2000 crore due to floods.
- 2. Erosion : Around 175 million hectares are erosion prone. Pastures turned out to be the wastelands. Every year the loss through top soil and soil nutrients is more than a 1000 crore rupees.
- 3. Siltation of Irrigation Projects : Soil erosion in the hills leads to siltation of the reservoirs, in which we have invested more than 10000 crore rupees. The life of these reservoirs has been reduced to almost half due to siltation.

THE effects on the tribal life have been tragic. Drastic reduction of humus has reduced the productivity of their land and forced them to a migrate in search of seasonal employment or fall in the trap of illegal timber merchants. The women take recourse to carrying firewood to nearby towns for sale. Monoculture has driven away the wildlife, his only source of animal protein. Forests, the life line of tribal, with their destruction has ruined his life. According to a report of the Planning Commission, India may soon face the Ethiopian type of crisis for water.

THE ecosystem is self-regulating and interdependent. The destruction of one part such as forests affects all the other parts. The key to the protection of the ecosystem, here, is the saving of the natural forests as well as afforestation on a massive scale.

## Need For Reforms in The Forest Act to Save The Tribals

IT IS necessary to outline the issues that are actually at stake in the forests. These are mainly three,

- 1. Justice to the people, both the tribals and the non-tribals.
- 2. Justice to the nature, (vegetation and wildlife).
- 3. Justice to the coming generations, so that natural resources are available in the long nm.

THE forest act is, however, not aimed at protecting the forest dwellers as amongst the other living things and their products. Any future legal reforms in "the forest act must first aim at doing justice to the people and only subsequently at doing justice to the nature and the future generations. It does not mean that doing justice to the nature is the second priority. The law is inter-related as the parts of the ecosystem. The only way by which the flora and the fauna can be protected is by protecting the people, the tribals. If they are protected and made saviours of the forest, natural forests will be saved and justice to the nature would be done, the obligation to the future generations follows from this because we would have not destroyed what is meant for all. Thus, by setting our priorities right, all the three aspects of the justice would be simultaneously accomplished.

NOW the question arises as to from whom the people are to be protected. They have to be saved from the contractors, industrialists, money-lenders and the wrong policies of the government and the administration.

HAVING settled the priorities the immediate issues are :

- 1. What is the exact nature and extent of the rights that the tribals have over the forests, their resources and the-benefits arising from them?
- 2. What rights they should have?
- 3. The criterion of justice to determine the rights.
- 4. Who will provide the people with such rights? What is the position in the present act?
- 5. The remedies available to the people when their rights are not met.

THE above issues call for reforms in the present forest act. According to the Indian Forest Act 1927, no person can claim a right to private

property in the forest land merely because he has domiciled there, or even if his forefathers have lived there for centuries. Nor do such people have any rights over the forest produce, vide Sec.3 of the act. The government may constitute any forest or waste land which is the property of the government or over which the government is entitled, as a reserved forest. Tins section presupposes that forest land is the state property though the tribals co-habit the forest. Section 4 of the forest act provides for elaborate provisions for obtaining the land as the forest land. It directs the Forest Settlement Officer to issue notice in the official gazette about the government's intention to declare the forest land as the reserved forest so that any person who has any right over any part of that land may claim it as his private property. Section 5 puts a bar on a|l rights if they are not claimed within three months of the issue of the notification in the official gazette. Where private property rights are claimed, the government can further invoke the land acquisition act 1894 for the public purpose. Asking the people to claim rights in private property when they are unaware of such a concept amounts to playing with people's ignorance. The section 5 of the forest act further directs for the notification of the rights to the individual private property alone, not to rights in common or the communal rights of the tribes. Th'e^est dwellers have been continually using the forest and the forest produce. Hence, despite the fact that they did not claim rights to land and resources section 6 to 16 of the Forest Act deals with the claims to partial rights such as grazing, water resources, shifting cultivation and the use of the forest produce, etc. Such rights depend entirely on the discretion of the Forest Settlement Officer. Hence, they become only privileges granted to particular persons or groups. common

## CONCLUSION

AFTER a just and rational analysis presented above Subhash C. Babu, IFS (1994) raises some important issues.

HOW to save the tribals and the forest is a big question. Till today, they have no stakes in the preservation of the forest. Their own poverty has made them an easy prey to the vested interests and, thus, degraded the forest environment. A local vested interest in protecting the forest should counteract the powerful timber lobby. The Chipkd Andolan is a clear manifestation of this. It is futile hope to expect regulation and penalty to deter the, illegal timber trade, especially when the stakes are high and risks are low, the forests cannot be policed, they can only he protected and that too by the local people only.

THE new forest policy rightly points out at the involvement of the tribals in the preservation, protection and re-generation of the forests and that the first charge on the forest produce should be the needs and aspirations of the tribals and the local people. Unless they are taken into confidence and made the partners in the development of the forest no massive afforestation will re-cloth our denuded forests and hill slopes. Hence, it is essential to meet the priorities and requirements of the tribals. The tribal does not or would not like to consider himself an object of compassion and charity. He feels, on the other hand, that he has been the victim of the extraneous forces, which have taken advantage of his relative innocence in worldly matters and duped him of his birth right.

AS FAR AS the foresters and the forest department are concerned the change of attitude is a must. The present concept of ownership and monopoly of the forester and their produce will have to relent to create a feeling 0/co-ownership or partnership between him and the tribals. The change of foresters\* present attitude may not be very simple as it may involve legal and administrative complexities. Nevertheless, the forester's cooperative spirit towards the tribals, in view of the peculiar circumstances, must assume some concrete shape to inculcate mutual trust, confidence and goodwill among the tribals towards the forest administration.

THE provisions in the National Forest Policy 1988 with regards to the tribals are alone insufficient. Hence, a revised All India Forest Act is the need of the hour. Under persistent pressure and advocacy of tribal rights the government of India passed a landmark Act in 2006. Now the pressure should be for its sincere implimentation (see Act in annexure).

# The Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006

MILLIONS of people live in and near India's forest lands, but have no legal right to their homes, lands or livelihoods. A few government officials have all power over forests and forest dwellers, the result? Both forests and people die. This Act recognises forest dwellers' rights and makes conservation more accountable.

# Why is this law necessary?

WHAT are called "forests" in Indian law often have nothing to do with actual forests. Under the Indian Forest Act, areas were often

declared to be "government forests" without recording who lived in these areas, what land they were using, what uses they made of the forest and so on. 82% of Madhya Pradesh forest blocks and 40% of Orissa's reserved forests were never surveyed; similarly 60% of India's national parks have till today (sometimes after 25 years, as in Sariska) not completed their process of enquiry and settlement of rights. As the Tiger Task Force of the Government of India put it, "in the name of conservation, what has been carried out is a completely illegal and unconstitutional land acquisition programme."

### What are Conditions like in the forest areas?

BECAUSE of this^sftaa^on, millions of people are subject to harassment, evictions, etc. on the pretext of being encroachers in their own homes. Torture, bonded labour, extortion of money and sexual assault are all extremely common. In the latest national eviction drive from 2002 onwards, more than 3,00,000 families were driven into destitution and starvation. In Madhya Pradesh alone, more than 125 villages have been burned to the ground.

THE situation is so bad that the then Commissioner for Scheduled C^tes and Scheduled Tribes, in his 29th Report, said that "The criminalisation of the entire communities in the tribal areas is the darkest blot on the liberal tradition of our country."

#### Why were people's rights not respected when these forests were declared?

THE Indian Forest Act, 1927, India's main forest law, had nothing to do with conservation. It was created to serve the British need for timber. It sought to override customary rights and forest management systems by declaring forests state property and exploiting their timber. The law says that, at the time a "foresf' is declared, a single official (the Forest Settlement Officer) is to enquire into and "settle" the land and forest rights people had in that area. These all powerful officials unsurprisingly either did nothing or recorded only the rights of powerful communities.

THE same model was subsequently built into the Wild Life Protection Act, passed in 1972, with similar consequences.

#### Mistakes may have been made, but surely these laws are the best way to protect our forests?

IT IS not just people who have lost. The very purpose of the Forest Acts was to convert forests into the property of a colonial department;

and when you convert an ecosystem into someone's property, there will always be stronger claims to that property than conservation. To destroy a forest today requires nothing more than either a bribe to the local forest officer or an application to a committee in Delhi. The results include:

THE loss of more than 90% of India's grasslands to commercial Forest Department plantations.

THE destruction of five lakh hectares of forest in the past five years alone for mines, dams and industrial projects;

THE clearing of millions of hectares of forest for monoculture plantations by the Forest Department;

RECENT proposals to privatise "degraded" forest lands for private companies' timber plantations.

MOREOVER, the forest laws destroyed all the community management and regulation systems that had existed before, forcing people to choose between either abandoning the forest entirely or living as 'criminals' within or near it, this day it is a criminal offence for you or I to plant a tree in a reserved forest; but it is legal for the Department to fell the entire forest so long as it has Central government permission.

## What does the Forest Rights Act do?'

THE Act basically does two things:

- Grants legal recognition to the rights of traditional forest dwelling communities, partially correcting the injustice caused by the forest laws.

- Makes a beginning towards giving communities and the public a voice in forest and wildlife conservation.

#### Who is a forest dweller under this law, and who gets rights?

THERE are two stages to be eligible under this Act. First, everyone has to satisfy two conditions:

- 1. Primarily residing in forests or forest lands;
- 2. Depends on forests and forest land for a livelihood (namely "bona fide livelihood needs")

Second, you have to prove:

— That the above conditions have been true for 75 years, in which case you are an Other Traditional Forest Dweller [s.2(o)];

OR

- That you are a member of a Scheduled Tribe [s.  $2(c)$ ]; and
- That you are residing in the area where they are Scheduled [s. 4(1)].

In the latter case you are a *Forest Dwelling Scheduled Tribe*.

#### What kind of rights do forest dwellers get under this Act?

THE law recognises three types of rights:

#### Land Rights

NO ONE gets rights to any land that they have not been cultivating prior to December 13, 2005 (see section 4(3)) and that they are not cultivating right now. Those who are cultivating land but don't have document can claim up to 4 hectares, as long as they are cultivating the land themselves for a livelihood (section  $3(1)$  (a) and  $4(6)$ ). Those who have a patta or a government lease, but whose land has been illegally taken by the Forest Department or whose land is the subject of a dispute between Forest and Revenue Departments, can claim those lands (see section  $3(1)$  (f) and (g)).

THERE is no question of granting 4 hectares of land to every family. If I am cultivating half a hectare on December 13, 2005, I receive title to that half a hectare alone; and if I am cultivating nothing, I receive nothing. If I am cultivating more than 4 hectares without documents or a dispute, I receive title to only 4 hectares.

The land cannot be sold or transferred to anyone except by inheritance (see section  $4(4)$ ).

**Use Rights** — The law secondly provides for rights to use and/or collect the following:

- a. Minor forest produce things like tendu patta, herbs, medicinal plants etc "that has been traditionally collected (see section 3(1) (c)). This does not include timber.
- b. Grazing grounds and water bodies (sections 3)
- c. Traditional areas of use by nomadic or pastoralist communities i.e. communities that move with their herds, as opposed to practicing settled agriculture.

#### Right to Protect and Conserve

THOUGH the forest is supposed to belong to all of us, till date no one except the Forest Department had a right to protect it. If the Forest Department should decide to destroy it, or to hand it over to someone who would, stopping them was a criminal offence.

FOR the first time, this law also gives the community the right to protect and manage the forest. Section 3(1) (i) provide a right and a power to conserve community forest resources, while section 5 gives the community a general power to protect wildlife, forests, etc. This is vital for the thousands of village communities who are protecting their forests and wildlife against threats from forest mafias, industries and land grabbers, most of whom operate in connivance with the Forest Department.

#### How are rights recognised?

SECTION 6 of the Act provides a transparent three step procedure for deciding on who gets rights. First, the gram sabha (full village assembly. NOT the gram panchayat) makes a recommendation - i.e. who has been cultivating land for how long, which minor forest produce is collected, etc. The gram sabha plays this role because it is a public body where all people participate, and hence is fully democratic and transparent. The gram sabha's recommendation goes through two stages of screening committees at the taluka and district levels. The district level committee makes the final decision (see section 6(6)). The Committees have six members - three government officers and three elected persons. At both the taluka and the district levels, any person who believes a claim is false can appeal to the Committees, and if they prove their case the right is denied (sections 6(2) and 6(4)). Finally, land recognised under this Act cannot be sold or transferred.
