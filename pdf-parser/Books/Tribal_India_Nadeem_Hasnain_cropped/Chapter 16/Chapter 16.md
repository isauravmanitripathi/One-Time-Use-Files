THIS is an extract from the letter written by Dr. B.D. Sharma, IAS, to the President of India as part of the 29th report (1987-89) submitted by him as The Commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. This is a historical document and has been made part of the text of this book so that every reader reads it. Popularly known as 'IAS Gandhi', B.D. Sharma has given voice to the voiceless and helpless tribals. Currently, after his retirement, he is working through his organization Bharat Jan Andolan. Author

I AM presenting herewith the Twenty-ninth Report on the condition of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under Article 338 of the Constitution for the year 1987-89, In the last report, which my first report, I had reviewed the situation of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in broad terms. In that report one major aspect which came to the fore was that a dualistic system is getting established in our country. The modem organised sector comprises the upper segment Consequently, even amongst the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, two different segments are getting established exactly in the same fashion. The modem organised sector is the leading sector of our developing economy. Therefore, all eyes are set on it and everyone is looking at it with fond hope. It was in this , context that I had made extensive recommendations in the earlier report so to ensure that the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes get an equal opportunity and honourable position . in both the segments, particularly in the organised modem sector. The real partnership in the grand procession of development cannot remain confined only to reservations in services but must extend to all segments of national life. Only then the system can tmly be considered to imbibe the spirit of the Constitution implicit in the protective provisions and the right to equality. was

1. THE irony, however, is that such a dualistic system is by its very nature inequitous. Therefore, if we see the above plea for equity and justice in the broader context of national economy it will mean a plea merely for sharing of non-justified benefits of an inequitous system. Secondly, even after the policy of equitable sharing is implemented with full responsibility and honesty it will

benefit only a small segment amongst the weaker sections of our society. And here is an extremely regrettable aspect of this scheme. If the system continues as it is, the burden of deprivation and exploitation will continue to increase and will, to a large extent, fall on the members of the same community, bulk of whom happen to be located in the lowest stratum of our system. In this Way, a highly anomalous situation is being created. This partnership in injustice in the name of justice acquires appearance of justice. But by the same token in such a milieu, not only ignoring broader issues of justice and equity but even opposing the same also tend to be justified. Therefore, unless the question of equity and justice is considered from the perception of the people located at the lowest rung of our society, which accounts for bulk of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes excepting a small section who have joined the organised sector, the safeguards in the Constitution for these communities will remain, more or less, meaningless.

2. THE life of the vast majority of our people is linked with three elements, viz., the right over resources, the right over means of production and the entitlement for labour. These aspects unfortunately have either not been properly discussed or in case there is some discussion it is mostly superficial. The reason is that the moment such issues are seriously considered, the very foundation of the vested interests, which are flourishing in the of modernity, progress and development, gets shaken. But these are the questions which are crucial for the welfare of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. And what is more, they are also crucial for the quality of national life, basic principles and human values. It is in this context that 1 had decided to undertake a special review of the national scene with regard to these three elements. The present report and the previous one taken together in a way make for a comprehensive frame. This frame can provide the basis for a life of honour and dignity for all members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Moreover, the frame can also become the frame for establishment of a social order imbued truly with the ideals of equity and justice. name

# The Three-tiers in National Life

3. THE situation in our country with regard to the establishment of an appropriate system and suitable manner for enabling the common man to lead his life with honour and dignity is rather

unhappy. The polarisation in our national economy is becoming increasingly sharper. On the one end we have the carefree setting of the modem oiganised sector. The moment a person steps in this sector, he is free from all worries about his oixlinaiy living for all times. In that wonyless life, the only worries are how to retain one's position, how to get as laige a share in the comforts and luxury-goods characteristic of that sector and how to somehow move along the high tide of so-called development. On the other extreme is located the unoiganised traditional sector. The question before the ordinaiy people here is that ofjust two square meals. The only wish of those people, however, in this sector who command the resources and also those who understand the new world, is somehow to Join the modem sector, or else to amass similar artifacts of comforts and luxuiy there Itself, ^erefore, the general scenario in this sector is that of strife, loot and raw stmggle for existence.

- 4. IN THIS milieu the ... - . growing centralisation in our economy is adding fuel to fire. Whatever is left with the ordinaiy people is being snatched away on the strength of law or sheer use offeree and money power. Whatever is being snatched away from this side IS ptting accumulated at the other end. Is this way not only a dualist but a three-tier structure is getting consolidated comprising India, Bharat and Hindustanva'\*. The bulk of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes included in this lowest tier of Hindustanva. are
- 5. IT IS clear that this process in our national life is not in keeping with the intention of our Constitution. It is also against the declared principles. But then how is it happening? I have tried to look into this question in some details with a view to find a possible solution. There are two basic aspects. One concerns the texture of our legal structure and the other related to the paradigm of development. So far as the paradigm of development is concerned, we have accepted the path adopted by the western countries as the ideal. Moreover, in a hurry for development we have accepted the questionable premise of "development first" and given social equity a secondaiy position. In this approach an important fact of the global system was overlooked that the dustbin ' of the third world was a necessaiy concomitant of the process of development in the first and the second worlds. In the same continuation, the third world now requires a "dustbin\* of "fourth world". Today in our countiy Hindustanva has become that very dustbin of development.

# Dissonance between Law and Constitution

6. THE present system is patently inequitous. But unfortunately our legal structure has also proved to be its compeer. The wasp and weft of our legal system was broadly set during the British period. The basic premises of the system established by the British were those of their own society and its objective was to strengthen the foundations of their empire. The people were subject and the system was symbol of the Raj. After in dependence we prepared and adopted a Constitution dedicated to the establishments a socialistic society based on our own traditions and basic human values. But the structu\*-e of the system, over which this crown of Constitution was placed, was totally dissonant with its basic spirit. This dissonance not only continued in the coming years but the situation became still worse. Firstly, the nascent ruling elite came to relish the old system. Secondly, in the hurry for development the incongruities were first ignored and later on they were accepted as necessary for the maintenance and advancement of the system. There was yet another important reason for the continuance of the Inconfruous situation. The law and the rules are concrete and functional while values are abstract. The latter generally a good subject of thought and discussion which by itself can be a matter of satisfaction. Consequently big mountains of violation of Constitution and human rights could remain hidden behind the small straws of the legal frame. even new are

# Right to Life

7. THE most sacred and primary amongst all human rights is the right to life. The right to life does not only mean the right to bare animal level subsistence; it really means right to live with human dignity. And two crucial elements for a life with dignity are personal liberty and adequate means of livelihood. The form of these elements in real situations can be quite different depending the specific economic and social situation. For example, in the modern sector they comprise what are known as the fundamental rights. But when it comes to the tribal people, who located on the other end of the spectrum |n the traditional sector, these formal principles in the present context have no meaning. In their situation a self-governing system based on their own tradition and within the understanding of the ordinaiy people is essential for enjoyment of these rights in the real sense. on are

- 8. THE situation in relation to appropriate means of livelihood is very complex. Moreover numerous anomalies have plagued the system. So far as the adequate means of livelihood in the oiganised sector is concerned the formal form is dominant. Eveiy member of this sector has a specified position and whatever the role of that person, irrespective of its utility or non-utility for life be not only can claim due entitlement just by virtue of the membership of the oiganised sector but can also openly claim entitlements which are not really Justified. But in the case of unoiganised sector no body is sure about what a member of that sector will finally set. And the situation of each member in the sector may be quite different. Nevertheless, it can be said that broadly command over resources, ownership of means of product and due entitlement for labour are three such elements which together determine the situation of an individual and also the community with regard to the appropriate means of livelihood.
- 9. THUS, there are five elements which are necessary for life with dignity, self-management at the community level, command resources by the community, ownership of means of production by the worker, equitable entitlement of labour and personal liberty. These are the basic rights for the human society. These are also the soul of a democratic system. These values have been enshrined in our Constitution in unequivocal terms. over

## And Its Denial

10. EVEN though the position about the right to life in the Constitution is crystal clear, yet so far as the right to life of the common man is concerned, it is not only being ignored in practice but is being blatently violated. The main reason for this situation is that during the British period the natural resources were accorded the status of property under the law rather then being recognised as the basis of life of the people. The irony is that even after the right of property was removed from the list of fundamental rights and in the face of clear enunciation by the Courts about the real intent of the right to life enshrined in the Constitution, the legal frame in that regard in practice remained unchanged in its original colonial form. That is why there is a direct clash at almost every step in the national life between the Constitutional and human right of right to life of the common people and the legal right of property of the more powerful groups. It can be said that in the inequitous distribution of resources during the British period the state and a groups of

selected people along with the state become the owners of all natural resources including land. But by the same token the common man, who was using those resources for making a living through the ages was deprived of his natural right to make a living from them. This process unfortunately has become still more stronger after independence.

- 11. IN VIEW of this denial of the basic right to life, a big question arises about the nature of responsibility of the state itself. After all in our Constitution the State has been given a special responsibility in relation to social justice. Then how is this all happening ? To answer this question we will have to review the different roles of the State in the complex modern situation and the priorities adopted by the State in that regard. The State can broadly be said to have three primary responsibilities, viz., law and order, protection and development. In the anxiety to maintain order and in the hurry for development as also in the dazzle of its glitter, the dark lanes of the State's responsibility for protection of the poor, particularly the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, have been often forgotten. Moreover there is no hesitation in supporting the vested interests entrenched in the old as well as the new structures under the cover of policies, principles and laws and even in striking against those whom the State is expected to protect. In some areas, it appears as if law, Constitution, human rights and state's responsibility are all nonexistent. This is the biggest irony of our national life which I have tried to present in this report.
- 12. THIS phenomenon is an integral part of the inhuman processes of deprivation and destitution which has been continuing for ages. But its scope became much wider and its intensity much higher during the British period. A careful review of the present situation clearly brings out five levels of deprivation, viz.,  $-(i)$ non-recognition of rights over resources and restrictions on their use, (ii) Alienation of worker from the means of production, (iii) denial of due entitlement of labour, (iv) bartering of personal liberty and finally (v) the psychological state of accepting deprivation and destitution as justified and proper and demise of self-respect and dignity. It is unfortunate that the processes of deprivation have not only continued at all these five levels throughout our national life, with the bare exception of the organised sector, but at many places it has become much more intense. It will be necessary to start our review with the last level.

# Social Prestige and Dignity

- 13. THE honour and dignity of a person is dependent on his work, his right over means of production and his right to manage the system. The condition of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes on all these counts was deplorable from the veiy beginning. Hard work fell in their share while command over resources was enjoyed by others. But after independence these people were rendered still more helpless and vulnerable in the face of unholy collusion between the system and the more powerful groups. Firstly, whatever means of production had remained in their hands are also gradually slipping through their fingers. Secondly, there is also a state of near lawlessness in the villages. In this milieu, the remaining resources of the village community are being commandeered in some cases by the sfronger people of the village in some other cases by small and big companies and finally in some cases by the State itself ignoring the fact of dependence of the people on those resources for their living and their traditional rights. Who cares and who knows where these people should go? In this raw struggle for existence prestige and dignity for the ordinaiy people are at best images of a dream world.
- 14. THE biggest irony with regard to dignity and prestige of a people in our country is that the condition of the tribal communities, who are most conscious about self-respect and honour, is the worst. These communities have become completely helpless in the face of the omnipotent system on account of the 'criminalisation\* of their social and economic system^ itself, denial of their rights over resources and non recognition of their traditional self-governing systems. The forests are the property of the State; therefore it is an offence for the tribal, who has been living in those very forests for the ages, to make a living from these forests. His very presence in the forest is against the law. If a tribal enters the forests with his bow and arrows, it is an offence. If his cattle as usual graze in the forest, they are taken to a kine house. If he takes his traditional brew after worshiping his Gods or in social functions according to his tradition he still becomes a law breaker. He is branded as an offender in all matters concerning his social and economic life only because the law is against him. The criminalisation of the entire communities in the tribal areas is the darkest blot on the liberal tradition of our country.

- 15. AND the saddest thing is that all this has happened and is happening in the name of principles, claiming authority from the Constitution and the law. That is not all. This is being done by a system, which considers itself to be a symbol of justice, rationality and modernity. Those who have been given the responsibility under the Constitution for correcting this anomalous situation have almost no realisation about that responsibility. The first attempt of the ^stem ordinarly is to assert its own. position as right and to prove that the others are on the wrong. It is expected that the tribal society should change and adapt itself in accordance with the frame of the modem system. And finally, an attempt is made to convince the people that this what development really is!
- 16. THUS, firstly no action has been taken to correct this basic anomaly and even if some action is initiated, one can never be sure as to where it might get stuck. The result is that today there is a state of confrontation in almost all the tribal areas. In this connection I have reviewed in some detail the Excise Policy in the tribal areas. There are clear policy guidelines of the Central Government in this matter. But even after 16 years of their issue they have not been adopted in full by any State so far. Even where they have been adopted, something or the other gets incorporated at some stage of implementation or the other such that the basic spirit of those guidelines cannot be realised. Moreover when people demand implementation of the policy guidelines, they have to face the wrath of the system.
- 17. I HAVE discussed the issue of Excise Policy in some detail because this issue touches the personal and social life of every tribal. In this case even when a tribal strictly follows the social norms of his community he breaks the law, he is an offender before the law and legal action can be taken against him. Can there be a more regrettable situation than this? Any law in the tribal areas, which makes the social tradition of the tribal people a criminal act, is against the spirit of the Constitution. If social prestige and personal dignity in the tribal areas are to be upheld all these legal anomalies must be done away with immediately.

# Entitlement of the Common Man

18. THE biggest question in relation to the right to life is the entitlement of the common man for his labour input. What can be the meaning of honour and what can dignity signify to a

hungry person? The present situation in this regard is unjust. The members of the organised sector first take away from the gross national product what they consider is due to them on the basis of highly inflated and arbitrary entitlements. The members of the unorganised sector have to be content with whatever is left thereafter. The fact is that not even proper valuation has been made of the work of ordinary labourers outside the organised sector including the framer. It is an irony that the agricultural labourer in our agricultural country whose work is the most skilled, the most arduous, and whose working conditions are the most difficult has been graded as an unskilled worker. This is also the case with other workers in the unorganised sector. Their skills are deemed to be 'non-skilled' and their knowledge as 'ignorance'. And all the skilled workers in the traditional sector are gradually becoming a motley crowd of unskilled people, a process which was set in motion as a part of imperial design during the British period. In the case of most of these workers, deprivation has reached the ignominious level of 'biological exploitation', which is not even alluded to.

- 19. I HAVE referred to in my last report the unconstitutionality of the dualistic system in the determination of wages and salaries for the organised and unorganised sectors. But this serious constitutional issue has not been even discussed so far in any forum. This duality is at the root of inequity in our country. If the question of justice for the common man is considered in the real sense, then the first step will inevitably have to be equitable determination of wages of the agricultural labourer. It will directly lead to a substantial rise in the price of agricultural commodities. In the end, it will boost the entitlements of all workers in the unorganised sector. Thus a new relationship will be established between the organised and the unorganised. The natural outcome of this process will be that the entitlements of people belonging to the organised sector at the other end will be significantly reduced compared to what they are enjoying today. The members of the organised sector will not easily accept this new deal. But this simple logic and this stark reality about injustice in our national life have to be got accepted by them whether they like it or not. Or else, how can the common man expect to get justice without changing such glaring unjust relationships in our national economy?
- 20. THIS is the plain reality about our economic structure. If this reality is ignored it will not possible even to present the correct

analysis of our national problems. And if the disease itself is not correctly diagnosed how can we expect a real cure? For example, from analysis presented in the report it is clear that there is no unemployment in our country. The reality is the so-called unemployment is a part of a big conspiracy by the vested interests which has only one objective, that is, to extract maximum work from the ordinary man with a minimal wage which may be just sufficient for his bare physical survival so that he can contribute his bit until his limbs can move and in the end he is obliged to withdraw from the stage after providing a "substitute". It is here that deprivation in our country descends to the abysmal level of biological exploitation.

21. THE members of the Scheduled Castes comprise a substantial segment amongst the workers in the unorganised sector. In the present situation when the members of the Scheduled Castes do not have anything which they can call their own except their labour and their skills, their struggle for entitlement for their labour is the real struggle for justice; it is also a struggle for the right to life. The first step for social justice in this context has to be due recognition of the skills of the agricultural labourers and conferral on him the status of skilled workers. Moreover, his wages should be fixed in accordance with the principles accepted for oi^anised sector such that his wife and children are not forced to go out of their homes in search of work and as a respectable citizen he can also maintain his family with his own earnings.

# Rights over Means of Production

22. MOST of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are dependent, in some way or the other, on agriculture. But their muddle in this regard has been in the tribal areas, which is continuing even now. Firstly, in many areas there are authentic papers. Therefore, the position about land such as the size of holding, its precise location, is not properly recorded. Secondly, the laws are much too intricate which are beyond the understanding of the people. According to the present law, any land which is not recorded in the name of an individual is deemed to belong to the state. Therefore the government can do whatever it likes with regard to such lands. On the other hand the ownership, in a way, is bestowed automatically in favour of a person the moment his name is entered in the records in an appropriate column. The outsiders have taken full advantage of these legal stipulations. Today not only the recor'\* no

is against the people, the entire system is against them. The correct information about cultivation, ownership, etc, concerning land is available only in the village, yet all disputes about land are decided in courts outside. It is well-known that a simple person has no hope of getting justice there. But he cannot do anything, he is utterly helpless.

- 23. IN MANY areas, particularly where industrial complexes are being established, there is a state of near lawlessness. The case of Sonbhadra in U.P. is extremely regrettable; the area is wimessing open loot in the name of settlement. The instructions of government and even decisions of Courts are unable to protect the tribal lands. Unless, there is a basic change in the present system such that all matters concerning land are decided in the open, in the presence of village people, the tribal people cannot get justice. To leaye the entire tribal community at the mercy of an outside formal system in matters concerning land, which is the only basis of their life, is patently unjust and in violation of Constitutional safeguards. A people's movement has been launched on this issue in Sonbhadra. The demands of the people in this vital matter must be conceded. In fact, that proposition should be accepted as the norm for preparation and maintenance of land records for all tribal areas in the countiy.
- 24. THE most basic question about land concerns entitlement of the tiller of land. Even though the right of the tiller on the land he tills has been accepted in principle in our country. Yet in reality his position is the weakest. In my previous report, I had made extensive recommendations with a view to give the principle of 'land to the tiller' a real form. In this context, unfortunately the position at the moment is that it is not even certain that the tiller of the land can continue to till the land, the question of bestowal of ownership rights remains a far ciy. In some states, it is almost impossible even to get the fact of cultivation by a tenant entered in government records. I have given two examples in this regardone from Bihar (Sole Daltanganj) and another from Andhra Pradesh (Pulimamidi). In both these cases the people, most of whom belong to Scheduled Castes, are cultivating the land but their names do not find a place in the record. They have asked the government to provide protection for their cultivation about which the concerned governments have not taken a clear stand. Therefore, they have resolved to protect for themselves their basic right to till the land.

- 25. IN THESE cases the issues concerning land record and cultivation appear to be very simple. But some of them involve basic question's. If a person is cultivating a place of land, then should this fact be not recorded in government papers? Whatever is on the ground must get reflected in the record in someway or the other. If even this simple thing is not being done as a conscious policy in our system it has only one implication. An easy way has been found to ignore the due entitlement on land of the poor people. This position may be legal, but it cannot be said to be just and cannot be accepted as being in accordance with the spirit of our Constitution. Here lack of consonance between the law, justice and constitution become glaring. And this is not the clutches of zamindars-absentee or otherwise. The person who tills that land and subsists on it has no relationship with it under the law.
- 26. ALL struggle concerning cultivation of land are basically a conflict between two rights. On the one side is the right to life and on the other the right to property. The right to life is basic and much higher than the right to property. Where a person is earning a living by cultivating the land, its ownership cannot be bestowed on him straight away for some reasons, the minimum which can be expected from the government is to ensure that he continues to remain in possession of that land his right to make a living from it is effectively protected.
- 27. THE first step for protecting the right to life related to land will have to be to ensure that, whatever may be the law, or even if the law is silent on this issue, the person who is cultivating a piece of land continues to be in possession of that land. This principle should be openly promulgated and the fact of possession through cultivation should be entered in government records. Moreover, if a zamindar tries to evict a person ignoring this right, the government has the responsibility to provide full protection to the victim. And if a government cannot protect this basic right, no one can take away the right of an individual for self-defence. This is the message of our Constitution.

## Bonded Labour

28. THE worst disregard of the right to life is being perpetrated in the case of bonded labourers. Their condition is extremely pitiable notwithstanding governmental statistics and comprehensive plans for their liberation and relief. The coffee plantations of Tamil Nadu are gold mines for their owners but

the tribal, who nurtures them through his sweat and blood, is a 'prisoner\* there. The limbs of labourers woridng for big landlords in Daltanganj and Champaran are chained in lieu of five kathas (measures) of agricultural land. In many areas on the border of U.P. & M.P., working in the stone quarries is the destiny of the people; they can lose their life should they dare to refuse to go to work; their limbs can be crushed; beating is an ordinary thing. Such oppression and such exploitation even after 14 years of enactment of the law for liberation of bonded labourers, which is in the knowledge of administration, about which even sensitive social workers out of sheer helplessness cannot but turn their face saying 'what to do?' is abominable. It is an open disregard of human rights, which is not merely a matter of regret, but is a matter of national shame for all of us.

29. IT IS clear that there is one basic defect in the policy about liberation of bonded labourers. The plan of liberation of the bonded labourer, instead of cutting the fetters of his slaveiy, cuts him away from the support of his life. What is necessaiy is to cut the shackles of slavery of the bonded labourer besides ensuring that in doing so he is not alienated from his life\* support. He has a right on the life support system or the enterprise in which he may be engaged. This fundamental right of his must be protected at any cost, yet the inhuman bondage must also be snapped forthwith. But even this will not be enough. The owners, who are responsible for this crime against humanity, should be extemed from those establishments and the labourers must be given the ownership right on the same. This will be the real liberation of bonded labourers.

# Right over Resources

30. THE primary resoi - other than agriculture in the traditional economy are foiw\_. otures (waste land and water) on which the ordinary people depend for their living. The wrong entitlements over resources of all descriptions started getting established during the British period. It was in that period that the intimate relationship between the resources and the local community which was like that between the mother and the child, was ended and the State acquired monopoly rights thereon. This Colonial process of centralisation has unfortunately got further reinforced under the tutelage of the new paradigm of development which has been adopted in our country after independence. The full implications of this colonialdevelopmental process are becoming clearer only now. Everywhere the life support system of the local community and the common man at the moment is being snatched away by the abstruse state institutions and big people without any qualms of conscience. In this situation, the people are engaged in a fierce struggle of their right to life. But the system is branding their current use of these resources as illegal and is driving them away taking undue advantage of its authority.

- 31. THE first fundamental change which was effected in this process related to forests. In the new frame, the symbiotic relationship between the forests and the forest dwellers was not recognised and the forests became property of the State. After the state acquired monopoly rights over the forests, a normal system was established for their management which gradually became increasingly comprehensive and also strong. The biggest irony of this change was that the forest-dwellers who has a life-long relationship with forest — which are their very homes, their religion, their culture and their everything - was conspicious by its absence in that frame. In this formal structure, which recognises only administrative and market relations, an all-out effort has been made to see that these life-long mother-child relationships are transformed into market relationships. How can this be possible? It is on account of this basic lack of understanding, that there is state of confrontation and regime of destruction in almost all the tribal areas which in final analysis means great injustice to the tribal people.
  - 32. THE British enacted the Indian Forest Act with a view to acquire formal control over the forests. At the time of reservation of forests, legal formalities were no doubt complied with, but there was no question of people getting justice. Most of the tribal people were forcibly evicted from their homes. The memory of that forcible eviction now remains only in their folk tales. Whosoever could do, prepared agricultural land outside the forests. Even then their living relationship with the forests still continued. Those communities, which are totally dependent on forests have not been able to come over this great tragedy even now. The primitive tribal communities and the shifting cultivators in many areas are still engaged in a struggle of life and death. Similarly, the right to life of the nomadic communities has also been disregarded. Their problems have so far remained altogether unnoticed.

- 33. IT IS clear that the right to life at the individual level and the human right of maintaining the identity at the community level in the case of the tribal people have been ignored in the Indian Forest Act. Therefore, this law is not in consonance with the spirit of our Constitution. But since the state itself was one party in this deal, there was no change in it even after the Constitution was adopted and the situation remains as it was before it. In this way, the Constitutional provisions for protection of tribal people as also the human rights have been ignored in the system of management of forests adopted in our country. This is also the most sore spot for the tribal people; this is also the most pathetic tale about the condition of these communities.
- 34. ALL the tribal areas were incorporated after independence in larger state units. In this process, no special attention was paid to the existing administrative arrangements and everywhere the system of the largest unit as it is was gradually extended to the tribal areas. Wherever forests were not reserved, the process of reservation was started. The private forests were taken over by the State. In this way, all special features of the earlier management systems that evolved in keeping with the local traditions stood derecognised in the new system. But people's life does not automatically change simply because a new system may have been adopted. Therefore, numerous anomalies arose in the field and people really could not accept the new system from the core of their hearts. Consequently there is confrontation in many areas on this count.
- 35. The process of reservation of forests after independence was largely pursued in a routine fashion. In some cases, mere formality was observed just for the sake of it and even the fact that some people were living in the forests was not taken note of. In this way, the spirit of the law itself was violated. For example, in some cases of Jagirdari forests the original inhabitants were deemed to be encroachers without any enquiry as soon as these forests were taken over by the state. In some cases, the officer did not visit the spot yet recommended reservation of the area. Similarly, there were a variety of local practices in each area, like warkas in Thane, dali in Raigarh and green manure leases in Karnataka, etc., which were not even looked at. Therefore, the old legal arrangements became illegal in many areas just with the passage of new law without any consideration and without any thought. And the tribal became a law breaker.

- 36. THIS reservation of forests predictably failed to protect the forests. Firstly, the internal pressure on forests has been rising incessantly on account of growing population and increasing needs of the people. But the biggest devastation was caused by external pressures. Extensive plantations of mono-culture species after clearing the natural forests in the name of scientific management, establishment of tea, coffee and cardamom plantations, leases of forests produce at throw away prices in the name of promoting industries and establishment of industrial and mining complexes in the name of development, construction of highways, heavy influx of outsiders, eviction of tribals, supply of forest produce for meeting new demands, everything in the end proved to be a big burden on the forests. Consequently, there was ruthless destruction of the forests. The worst effect of this mindless destruction has been on the life of the tribal people. The veiy basis of their life is getting destroyed. But unfortunately no attention has been paid to this aspect of denudation of forests. For example, food production in our country has increased manifold, but how much loss have the tribal communities sustained in terms of non-availability of food articles from the forests due to their destruction does not find a place in national accounting. In ail campaigns for the protection of forests the real culprit, who has destroyed them for quick gains and who continues to destroy them even now, is left out and the full wrath of the system falls on the tribal, who is already under tremendous pressure.
- 37. WHILE discussing management of forests, besides the issues concerning the life of the people, those relating to environment and national development cannot be forgotten. But a direct consequence of non-recognition of even the existence of the community and not associating it in the management of forests, the position of forests has become veiy vulnerable. They are like that public property which has no one to look after and, if at all there is one, he too is far away from the scene and has no significant role to play in its protection. It is true that the internal pressure on forests has increased. But the tribal after all brings only a pole or two for constructing his hut, a small branch for making his plough and dead wood for lighting the fire to protect him from worms and insects, wild animals as also from cold during the winter. Nowhere he has built grand mansions. When the tribal clears the forest and cultivates forest land it is under compulsion of his circumstances. If he can be provided an alternative, he will happily accept the same.

38. THE main reason for the i depletion of our resources is the growing inequality and the rising tide of consumerism. But unfortunately these facets/are not even alluded to anywhere. Therefore, the greatest need today is to put stringent check ori the consumerist life-style and ensure equitous entitlement in the use of natural resources. For achieving this, it will be necessaiy that all those vested interests, who have entered into forests for quick gains and establishing big jagirs, are ruthlessly suppressed. All plantations, small and big, legal and illegal for example those which have mushroomed in Karnataka, should be taken over by the government and handed over to the labourers. If a poor person gets due entitlement over the natural resources, he will be relieved of the problems of the day; only then he will be in a position to think for tomorrow; in that frame he will become the greatest friend of environment. There are some good experiments of partnership of the people in protection and development of forests from West Bengal which are worth emulation. In many areas, people are taking initiative on their own, which deserves to be strongly supported.

### Minor Forest Produce

39. THE minor forest produce has an important place with regard to people's partnership in forestry. I had recommended in my previous report that the people should atleast be given full rights over the minor forest produce. The rights presently claimed by the government on minor forest produce even with reference to the provisions of the Indian Forest Act, are not legal and royalty levied thereon is unethical. The declarations of the Government of Madhya Pradesh and Bihar last year recognising the tribal people as owners of minor forest produce instead of mere labourers engaged in collecting the same, was the first major step towards ending the historical injustice with regard to forest against the tribal people. It is. However, a matter of deep regret that regressive forces got active immediately after this declaration in Madhya Pradesh. And today the situation is that even this great decision is being dented. This regressive step is a mockeiy of the entire Constitutional ground plan in which the Slate has been given with great confidence the responsibility of protection of the interests of the tribal people. Will the Governor and the President keeping aside all sorts of formalities in this regard, ensure that this just decision is not negated and that the subsequent regressive decision does not became a blot in the history of our social justice.

### Wild Life

40. A HIGHLY anomalous situation has also arisen in the management of wild life on account of ignoring certain basic facts about the tribal scene as the tribal people and the wild animals have co-existed reasonably well from times immemorial, that wild life has not been destroyed by bows and arrows and that the real culprit responsible for their destruction is the outsider. Consequently, unnecessary restrictions are being placed on the activities of the tribal people and in many cases they are being forced to move out of their homes. Their plea is that they have been living with the tigers through the ages and they can still live with them quite well. But nobody is prepared to listen to them. In many areas their economy has been greatly damaged through measures which are not legal. There is open violation of their right to life, which is not in keeping with the spirit of our Constitution. There is an urgent need for serious review in all these cases both at the level of law and also in terms of actual practice.

### Displacement

- 41. THE other side of the issue of the rights over resources, in the context of their alternative use for development, is displacement. A comprehensive review of the situation about displacement clearly brings out that we have reached a critical stage in the journey of development, particularly in the tribal areas, which can no longer be ignored. The greatest loss in the wake of development has been caused to the tribals and the resourceless people, bulk of whom belong to the Scheduled Castes. Their rights over resources either have remained completely unnoticed or have been only partially recognised because all resources have been treated merely as property. The biggest irony is that a 19th century colonial law like the Land Acquisition Act is being used indiscriminately in the great voyage of development. This law . does not admit the concept of the right of life and the will of the Raj has been accorded the hoary status of 'public purpose.'
  - 42. THE Land Acquisition Act, in a way, is functioning like an indomitable, inanimate instrument for the transformation of the agriculture based traditional system into a modern system. This instrument, in that process, is snatching away from the poor all those natural resources which have formed the basis of their life so far, with the characterstic unconcern and mechanicality of an

instrument, for presenting the same to be used as raw material by the new system. The sharecropper, agricultural labourer, shephered, hunter, kevat and such like do not even exist in the eyes of this law which is concerned only with the so called owners of those resources. Moreover, the owner of land himself gets compensation only for his ownership right, following the principle of market price or capitalisation of net income. It is not even realised that land to a farmer is the source of making a living with skillful use of his personal labour. The stark reality about the wanderings of a proud farmer, whose honour is inexorably linked with his land, for vending his labour and his deep agony are not even alluded to. Meaningless are to the new world the questions of his honour, his sentiments and even his future!

- 43. WHATEVER may be the law on this point but, in my view, the means of livelihood of a citizen and his right to life cannot be taken away. Mere exchange of property is the concern of Land Acquisition Act, the concept of right to life simply does not exist so far as this Law goes. The law governing the acquisition of land, therefore, is not in accordance with the spirit of our Constitution, this law is unconstitutional. That is not all. The process, which is being adopted for the acquisition of land in the field, is unethical and anti-people. Acquisition of land becomes a certainty, once a decision is taken about establishment of a project. Invitation of objections in accordance with the law thereafter, is a mockery of the whole system. Thus, even though the letter of law may be followed but its intention is not being honoured. Therefore, the entire process is illegal.
- 44. THE situation in the tribal areas in relation to the displacement is especially a matter of grave concern. The rich natural resources located in these areas are today required for development. But the traditional rights of the people who are fully dependent on those resources for their living, are not recognised simply because they are not formally recorded. The biggest irony is that the existence of the community and its relationship with the habitat are not even alluded to in any law whatsoever. Moreover all those aspects of life, which cannot be captured within the frame comprising formal rights concerning property and market relations, are conspicuous by their absence. The emotional world of the tribal people is as real as the modern world of concrete jungle, it is much more sublime. Therefore, the protection of this sublime 'world' has also been recognised in the global context as a human right. The present process of land acquisition is not

only violative of the Constitutional rights but even that basic human right. The biggest irony is that the state does not hesitate in disowning even the Constitutional responsibility of providing protection to the simple tribal communities, simply because it has taken on its shoulders another grave responsibility of the so called development.

- 45. AN important question, which arises at this stage, is whether the tribal people should have an opportunity of participation in the fruits of development. It would have been a matter of great happiness for me if effective measures had been taken for this purpose. Today even rehabilitation depends on the mercy of the state. The entitlement of a displaced person is limited only to compensation and that too in respect of that property alone which may be in his name. But even so, what will he do with that money? Some islands of affluence do appear in the tribal areas with development, but they are surrounded by an ocean of misery, social disorganisation and personal destitution. When the tribal, after the loot of his resource base runs towards the forests for refuge, he is not allowed to set his feet there; they are out of bounds for him. He is obliged to join in the end the army of landless labourer in the countryside elsewhere or to seek the 'security' of city slums and their sidewalks. This is the plain reality of the so called development in the tribal areas nothing short of a great human tragedy!
- 46. THE fact is that the paradigm of development adopted in our country and its compeer life style are themselves incogruous with our socio-economic situation. So long as they are accepted as ideals, establishment of a 'Fourth World' and biological exploitation of the people comprising 'Hindustanva' are inevitable. Therefore, the very foundation of the new structure is wrong. The minaret of development, which is being raised on the ruins of the economy of the ordinary people with utter disregard of their fundamental rights, cannot be a lasting structure. The people, who are victims of injustice, are now rejecting this paradigm. Whatever may be the formal position about land acquisition, to the ordinary tribal it is nothing but forcible occupation of his land. There is nothing new in this. This has been his experience through the ages, it is his experience even now. There is, however, a difference. Earlier other people were aggressors, today the assault is by government itself. Then where is he to go? And it is here that he revolts - from the core of his heart — against the entire system.

- 47. A PRECONDITION for any new use of natural resources should be that the concerned institution or the government should not only provide an alternative economic base for the people, who may have been depending on them for their living, but should ensure that the new life is better than the earlier. Moreover, the government must proceed with honesty, it must be fully convinced that whatever is being promised is real and-feasible. What is still more important is that the affected people should themselves be able to realise that the alternative will be better for them and they are prepared for it of their free will. If these principles are ignored, any action in that situation which may cause displacement will be against the democratic values and also against the spirit of our Constitution. And any use of force in the name of law and order against the people, who are fighting for establishing their right to life, who are struggling against the paradigm of development which is not only inequitous, but is violative of the law of the land, is against the spirit of our Constitution and against human rights. In fact, it is a mortal affront to the cultural sensitivity of our countiy. And bulk of the affected people comprise the simple tribal people, members of the Scheduled Castes and other resourceless people, who have been suffering for ages and whose protection has been entrusted to the State by our constitution!
- 48. HERE we face a rather confusing and complex situation. All actions by the people described above are deemed to be violations of law and are being dealt with as such by the state authorities. If this approach continues, the solemn resolutions by the people will continue to be perceived as a form of revolt against its authority by the state. In that process the people will become still more disoriented and confrontation will get further accentuated. There is no doubt that in the end the system will have to bow before the people's will, but only after a great human tragedy. Can there be a more ridiculous situation than the one when a tribal is asked about the extremist activity in his area, his natural response with a sense of gratitude towards the extremists is that "if nothing else, at least atrocities of the administration have ended after the coming of the 'dadas'? What should one say about a system in which the Constitution itself has bestowed on the President and the Governors unlimited powers for protection and welfare of the tribal people, yet they have not been able to save the people from exploitation and oppression of their own servants, and this historic task has been

accomplished only by the Naxalites in some areas? What is the instrinsic nature of that system in which the law itself has become the biggest terror for the common man? Under the cover of that law, he is being deprived of everything - right to life, his honour and even his freedom And the law is being used for exploitation, oppression and finally even to wipe out their social identity itself. Exploitation, terror and tyranny are experienced reality of the common man, particularly the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

49. THIS is the tragedy of our national life. Those who ate operating the system are helpless before that system, they are prisoners of its logic. They are also perhaps to some extent assured about its premises to the poor. But the common man now has no faith, whatever faith is lingering is also disappearing. There is only one way to come out of this tragic situation, that is, to acknowledge, as the first step, the basic anomaly of our national life viz., the ritual of a legal process can strangulate justice—and give high regard to the wisdom of the people and follow them. The resolutions of the people referred to in this report, should not be seen in the narrow legal frame but must be viewed in the broader perspective of human rights and democratic values. Moreover it was Tilak and Gandhi who pronounced that "Swaraj is my birth right" and 'Toleration of injustice is a sin'. If the Government is helpless in removing the basic anomalies and ending the unjust situation, it can atleast do one thing, that is, not to brand those, who are struggling for justice as offenders. Self-governance is the soul of democracy. Supporting those, who are struggling for that principle, is the duty of all citizens. I hope that the Government will support the people's resolution for protecting their right to life in general and for establishing selfgoverning system in keeping with their tradition in the tribal areas. I further hope that the government will also adapt the formal system in accordance with the wishes of the people, even though with so much of delay, which alone will make the Constitutional scheme a living reality.

#### Five Tasks......

50. AN IMPORTANT objective of this Report is to establish, through you, a dialogue with the common man who, in the ultimate analysis, is the source of all reasons, all processes and finally all objectives. I have not made any formal recommendations. What recommendations can be made when the foundation of the

system itself is faulty? The law and the system itself against the spirit of the Constitution and basic tenets of natural justice; moreover the right to life of ordinary people is being violated at every step. The whole report itself is one substantial recommendation. are

51. SO LONG AS a process of basic change in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution does not begin, isolated measures will serve merely as patch work. It will be like dressing a wound while the root cause of the disease remains as it is. Nevertheless, some elements are vital. If consensus can be engendered about them, if eveiy person located at different levels in the national life can cpntribute according to his situation, it will be possible to fulfill, even though partially, the national goal and social obligation concerning equity and justice.

FIRSTLY, our legal frame should be restructured with the right to life of the common man as the central point so that the gross dissonance between the law and the Constitution can end. As a first step, all unconstitutional elements should be identified and removed from all the laws particularly those concerning the command over resources, ownership of means of production and entitlement for labour. A new legal frame should be evolved which is truely equitous.

SECONDLY, in whatever way the common man may be making his living, that should be recognised as a right and the state should provide protection to his right to life in that form removing all discordant elements. This should in particular cover bonded labourers working in different establishments, share croppere and agricultural labourers, forests dwellers and people depending the maiginal resources of village. on

THII^LY, a system of self-governance should be established at least in the tribal area in which the local community should have the full responsibility for managing their day-to-day life including the maintenance and use of all the resources.

FOURTHLY, so long as the State is unable to discharge the Constitutional obligations, the people's resolve for recreation of their system based on those basic values should be honoured and their peaceful struggles should be supported. Any use offeree, direct or indirect, against the people's struggles for establishing their right to life should be prohibited.

FIFTHLY, certain basic questions have arisen concerning the right to life, paradigm of development and the style of life within the

broads frame of the existing law, Constitution, human rights and the responsibility of the State particularly in the tribal areas. The movement in Narmada Valley has become a symbol covering all these questions. It will be necessary to find a satisfactory solution to these problems rising above the clamour amongst different interest groups in the immediate context to a higher level and broader frame of our civilisational obligation and human values. The paradigm of development and style of life must be redefined so that they are in harmony with the condition of our country and our national objective.

### .....And also a Resolution

- 52. AND there is a need for national resolution as well for creating a climate of goodwill, particularly in the tribal areas. A unilateral process of development should not be imposed on the voiceless people. Their life should not be put to stake in the name of national development and high ideals. Today, the tribal people have nothing but the backlash of development in the name of development which has lead to disorganisation as a community and destitution as individuals. Everywhere the tribal is pleading with folded hands — 'do not burn my hut'... 'save me, where I will go ? ... 'Our maiya (Mother) will be left behind' 'or else bomb and finish us ?'.. But there is no one to listen to him. The moving words of his pathetic pleas will keep wandering filling those hills and forests; they will continue to reverberate perhaps eternally laden with the chilling message of the helplessness of man in the face of an inhuman system ....
- 53. IF A climate of goodwill is to be created, the war waged against the tribal people in the name of development must be stopped forthwith. Instead he should be extended an invitation for participation in the great voyage for achieving real development. This is a difficult task. This will be possible only when we decide that a 'Fourth World' shall not be allowed to come into being as a concomitant of development in our country. It will be necessary to give a fresh look to the paradigm of development and the style of life. A climate of confidence and goodwill can be created in the tribal area only if attention is paid immediately to those people who have already become victims of development and the new system, who are in great agony. Instead of being concerned about moving ahead in a great hurry, the tribal people should be given, as the first step, the responsibility of managing their own socio-economic life on the one hand and should be

made partners in the latter national development on the other. It is possible that the pace of change and development may have to be slowed down to some extent. It is also possible that we may have to stop for a while in some places. But this is necessaiy and also desirable. If this caution is not exercised, the wheel of development itself may crumble in the face of bubbling discontent and erupting revolts in the tribal areas.

# Rights and Responsibilities

- 54. I CANNOT say what will be reaction of the system to this Report of mine. But when the question is of the very identity of onefourth of the people in the country, when the issue is about their basic right to life, when the people themselves are struggling for the establishment of that right, not to present a clear picture about the situation would have been the biggest crime. It would have been dereliction of my duty. I had suggested in my earlier Report that the National Development Council should especially consider this whole situation about the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled tribes separately. I had also requested the judiciaiy that they may review the situation in the context of the way the system has been functioning that whether the denigration of the rights of the people can be justified simply because the State did not dischai^e its responsibility entrusted to it by the Constitution and the tribal is facing its consequences. 1 will like to renew this request of mine once more.
- 55. BUT I will also like to ui^ge on all those people, who are a part of the modem system, that after all they also have a duty in their individual capacities. They may do whatever may be possible for fulfilling that obligation in relation to the people's struggles for fundamental rights and basic principles. If they cannot participate directly in their struggles for the right to life, the minimum which they can do is not to oppose them. Similarly, I will again ui^e on the political parties ftat the issues concerning basic principles should be kept separate from the politics of vote. The members of the oi^anised sector and those having command over resources comprising the so-called 'Bharat', may also look at the logic of the present system from the perspective of the bulk of the people who are resourceless comprising 'Hindustanva'. I hope that the man of learning will ponder over the simple analysis which has been presented here and guide the people to cut through the illusive obsession of development and inspire them to search for a new path so that

we can establish a socialist society in its true sense. And there is only one power — the youth power - which can bring about the vital qualitative change in the entire system. It is not merely a wish, but I am fully confident that our young people, implied by the spirit of dedication, sacrifice and driven by the dream of creating a new society will come forward to accept this great challenge in this unique phase not only in the history of our nation but in the history of the human civilization itself.

- 56. FINALLY I, as the Commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, myself have a responsibility that the people, for whom the Constitutional safeguards have been provided and the review of whose functioning has been entrusted to me, are made aware about the exact position in this regard. But the common man does not understand the abstract language of principles and policies. He is fully engrossed in the problems of the day. Unless the substance of all principles and policies is presented to him in the context of his day-to-day problems, they will have no meaning, they are of no significance. What 1 have said in this report will perhaps echo for a while in some assembly halls and then disappear in the void around. Only a dialogue concerning the struggle for life of the people themselves can be its real and lasting expression.
- 57. TODAY, when the ploughman who makes a living by tilling the land has no right over it, when the tribal is a stranger in his own home, when the workers and the tribals in many ai^ are fighting their battles all alone, when the state has no hesitation in using force against people struggling for establishing their right to life oblivious of the fact that it has not only been entrusted the full responsibility of their protection but whose very existence as a people depends on its good will, a highly anomalous situation has been created. Today, these people may get some real relief, though quite meagre, only from the extremists and thereafter they are unwillingly cau^t in the holocast of a crossfire. In this situation, if a dialogue has to be established with them for dischaiging, even though symbolic, the obligation as a part of the system and also in relation to the constitutional responsibility there is no other alternative but to get directly linked with their life struggle. It is within this frame of affection and obligation that it is now obligatory for me to get associated with the struggles of the common man, particularly the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, for the establishment of their right to life. I am presenting this report to you with this even

solemn resolve. It is also with a fond hope that there will be a serious discussion at the national level on the fundamental questions concerning human rights, democratic values and constitutional scheme raised in this report which may contribute in making a decisive turn in the national life and building up of our nation in the image of the dreams of the founding fathers of our Constitution.
