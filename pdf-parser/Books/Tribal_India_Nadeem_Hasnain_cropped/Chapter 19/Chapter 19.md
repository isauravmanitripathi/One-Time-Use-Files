# TRIBAL RESISTANCE, VIOLENCE, LEFT WING EXTREMISM and STATE RESPONSE

THE so called Maoist/Naxalite movement going on from Srikakulum in Andhra Pradesh upto Sonbhadra district in Uttar Pradesh, especially in the Central Indian Tribal belt, is being seen as one of the most serious problems being faced by Indian nation since independence. On the basis of its coverage in media, discussions, and debates by the State and non-state agencies, two perceptions prevail:

- 1. It is posing threat to internal security with national security implications. For those who view it like this, a security-centric and law and order approach would lead to a 'solution\*.
- 2. Others view it as a genuine socio-economic problem compounded by exclusion, discrimination, and maiginalization. For them it is a social movement for social justice. Moreover, it is not a problem but consequence of several problems. It is not a sudden eruption and its\* origin and roots may be traced to colonial times that witnessed a number of tribal revolts in response to the oppression and exploitation of the Adivasi population.

THE gravity of the situation may be gauged from the fact that it has taken under it\*s shadow around 200 districts in 15 states. It has spread over 35-40% of the geographical area of the country. The most affected regions are Southern Orissa, South and Central Chhattisgarh, South Bihar, Eastern Andhra Pradesh. Eastern Maharashtra and upto Southern Uttar Pradesh. The tribal population of the country is around 8% of the total population and almost 50% of the total tribal population lives in Bihar and Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh. This means that Central India is the laiigest tribal belt of the country. Significantly, the areas inhabited by the tribal people are the poorest, most underdeveloped, and most economically backward where they are living under severely oppressive conditions. The problem not to be missed is that the ultra left extremism and violence is most visible in these areas.

THOUGH, tribal problems vary from state to state but mostly, the common problem are land alienation, chronic indebtedness, food security, health, education and displacement. Nobody can deny it that in areas like Bastar, people even today have no access to potable and

safe water fit for human consumption. There are no schools and if schools are there, there are no teachers. Either hospitals are not there and if these are there, there are no doctors or medicines and people's representatives are hardly concerned about the state of affairs. Lakhs of tribal boys and girls are unemployed despite many of them being educated. They go to the nearby cities but return frustrated. Agrarian situation is so bad that agriculture is hardly productive and employment oriented. Their livelihood is severely jeopardized. Under these circumstances when they come across the gun totting Maoists showing sympathy towards their problems the tribal youths are naturally attracted towards them. When the Maoists loot food grains from government agencies and distribute it to the starving tribals, they become heroes. When they redistribute land to the landless, they become gods.

OF ALL the problems enumerated above displacement has emerged as the single most serious problem, ironically, most of the tribal areas are very rich in forest, water and mineral resources. In the postindependence period a number of developmental projects have come up resulting in large scale displacement. Hydroelectric and irrigation projects are the largest source of displacement. Other major sources of displacement are mining, super thermal and nuclear power plants, industrial and military installations, weapons testing grounds, railways and roads, expansion of reserved forest areas, sanctuaries and parks and technological interventions which cause the large scale displacement of traditional fisher folk and hand loom weavers. In the scenario of development and displacement the majority of the affected are obviously tribal communities who have been historically dependent on the natural resources for their subsistence. A significant point to be noted here is that the tribal communities are roughly 8% of the total population of the country, yet over 50% of those displaced and ousted belong to the tribal communities. The implication is obvious the tribal people are disproportionately affected by our developmental policies and the resultant displacement. What about rehabilitation? Documents of the Planning Commission admit that not even 20% of the displaced have been properly rehabilitated. Who will protect the livelihoods of the displaced people?

WILL it not be right to conclude that the tribal people have been made 'victims of progress'? Moreover, among the non-economic consequences of displacement, dismantling of kinship network, mutual support system and desecration of sacred groves are the important ones. Unfortunately, these tribal communities were hardly

made partners in progress. Previously, as a result of colonial exploitation they suffered for more than two hundred years at the hands of land grabbers, money lenders, forest and liquor contractors flourishing under the patronage of governmental agencies and in the post-independence period they were made to suffer as the sacrificial goat' at the alter of 'development'. That is why a number of tribal leaders have been asking an inconvenient question: "Are we an internal colony of India?"

THE founding fathers of the constitution formulated a number of provisions for safeguarding their interest. Almost all the state governments, in pursuance of the constitutional provisions, have come out with a number of legislative measures such as Prevention of Land Alienation Act, Regulation of Money lending Act etc. Moreover, the Fifth and Sixth Schedule of the Constitution have laid down a number of provisionsy&r the administration of the tribal areas and protection of their language and culture but they continue to be oppressed and exploited and their interests unprotected largely because of lack of political will on the part of the State to eliminate all forms of exploitation and social injustice.

IT IS said that folk songs never lie because these are the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings. It will not be out of place to mention two of the popular folk songs from the Jharkhand region:

"They made us many promises, more than I can remember but theyfulfilled just one-they promised to take over land and they took it. " ^

"When they (diku/outsiders) came to our land they were as thin as the eye of a needle. Sucking our blood, they have become fat as the ploughshare. " as

SUCH folk songs speak volumes of injustice and exploitation, it's a classic case of a whole population being made 'legally dispossessed.'

THE Expert Group of Planning Commission in 2006 came out with a report titled "Challenges of Development in Maoist Affected Tribal Areas." This report is a first of its kind in the last twenty two years by the centre. It has tried an open approach rather than a security centric one. This report also aigues that land related factors play an important role in the growth of Maoism. Pointing out that thousands of acres of land remain fallow, the expert group has asked the government to devise legal means to ensure that the landless get land It recommends that The Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional

# TRIBAL INDIA,343

Forest Dwellers (Recognition of forest rights) Act, 2006 be implemented in full earnest: in order to ensure people their land rights. It acknowledged that left radicalism has emeiBcd as a result of deficit planning. "Constant alienation has made people take up arms and it is time one understands the problem as not just a law and order problem but one whose foundations are socio-economic." The report relates extremism to deeper faults in governance, land alienation, unemployment and inequalities in society.

THIS is an undeniable fact that the tribal economy has been forest economy and vice-versa. The situation has been further compounded by a heavy use of the coercive apparatus of the state in the forests negating all democratic principles. The forest department, armed with the powers of the police, and the police itself rules the forests much like an occupation army. Arbitrary imprisonment' unpaid extraction of food etc. (eggs, chickens, goats, milk, forest produce etc), unpaid labour, forced extraction of money, down right looting of houses and settlements, rape and arson are regularly used to keep the tribes in subjugation. It is worth noting that normal laws do not operate in the forest areas. ,

CROSS misuse of Land Acquisition Act is one of the sorest points in this tragic situation. This situation reminds one of colonial India where the imperialist power laid claim on the property of the common people in the name of service and public purposes. But the fact of the matter is that they indirectly served their colonial interests only. The same policies still persist in independent India where the government has the power to acquire any property in the name of 'national interest'. In this so called 'public interest' and 'national interest' where does the tribal people figure? Are they not part ofthe 'public' and 'nation'? Who would protect their interests? Are we dealing with alien/enemy people from another land?

MULTINATIONAL Corporations have been given access to the natural resources in tribal areas in a big way especially in the mining sector. As Gautam Navlakha [2006] points out when the Central government speak of Maoists obstructing development in tribal areas it means the Maoist presence is obstructing corporate exploitation of minerals, forests, water and land resources of the adivasis. Corporations come with capital intensive, low job creating investment which necessitates import of skilled labour from outside and token employment for locals as members of an unskilled low wage labour force. The National Mineral Development Corporation's Kirandul and Bacheli mines in Dantewade district of Madhya Pradesh do not

employ local people. The entire iron ore mined here is exported through a dedicated railway line to Visakhapatam and then exported to Japan at low cost The so called 'Red Corridor', (areas under the influence of ultra-left forces) is full of minerals where the adivasis have been residing for centuries. The Multi-national companies are eyeing the minerals of these regions and the government is all set to sell It on the market rate and therefore it has signed hundreds of Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with these multi-national companies. Since the tribal populations in these areas strongly feel that they have been betrayed, neglected and dispossessed in the name of development, industrialization and 'national interest' they are resisting against unjust displacement. They also believe that in the name of fitting insuigency the government wants to capture the land Md hand it over to Ae multi-national companies, justice demands that the I^d Acquisition Act should be limited to national security and public welfare and should not be stretched to acquisition for companies, cooperatives and registered societies. The Act need to be toher revised to minimize displacement and secure the rights of the affected displaced persons.

ON MARCH 13,2006, the Union home minister tabled in parliament a status paper on the problems of left wing extremism. The policy, as laid down in the paper, to deal with 'Naxalite Menace' the following points: contains

- (i) The Government will deal sternly with the naxalites induleine in violence, ^
- (ii) Naxalism being an inter-state problem, the states will collective approach and pursue a coordinated counter it. adopt a response to
- (iii) The states will need to further improve police response and pursue effective and sustained police action against the naxalites and their infrastructure individually and jointly,
- (iv) There will be no peace dialogue by the affected states with the naxal groups unless the latter agree to give up violence and arms,
- (v) Efforts will continue to be made lo promote local resistance groups against the naxalites but in a manner that the villagers are provided adequate security cover and the area is effectively dominated by the security forces.

- (vi) Keeping in view that naxalism is not merely a law and order problem, the policy of the government is to address the menace simultaneously on political, security, development, and public perception management front in a holistic manner,
- (vii) Political parties must strengthen their cadre base in naxal affected areas so that the potential youth there can be weaned away from the path of naxal ideology,
- (viii) The slate governments will need to accord a higher priority in their annual plans to ensure development in these areas. The focus areas should be to distribute land to the landless poor as part of the speedy implementation of the land reforms, ensure development of physical infrastructure like roads, communication, power, etc. and provide employment opportunities to the youth in these areas.

OF THIS agenda of action the government has taken up on top priority the modernization of state police, supply of mine protected vehicles, long tern deployment of central para-military forces and recruitment in central para-military forces. The tribal and forest related issues, effective implementation of land reforms and creation of employment opportunities are the issues always talked about but never taken up seriously Should we hope this will be taken up in uigency now?

THE idea of promoting local resistance groups against the left militancy took the form of Salva Judum in which some local people were trained in warfare and given arms.

THIS is like creating a situation of civil war. This policy has been condemned by all peace and justice loving people. They demanded that this should be scrapped as it delegitimises politics, dehumanizes people and degenerates those engaged in their security. Above all, it means abdication of the state's responsibility itself. A better alternative will be to encourage civil society groups, having knowledge of and sympathy with the local tribal population in assisting this task force .for wider participation of people in the implementation of various laws.

AS A response of the civil society the points raised by B. D. Sharma in his letter to the President of India dated May 17,2010 also deserve serious consideration. Among other points, he quotes the former president or India, late K R Narayanan: "Let it not be said by the future generations that the Indian Republic has been built on the destruction of green earth and the innocent tribals who have been living there for centuries". B D Sharma further says that:

## 346 TRIBAL INDIA

- (i) The tribal people are the most democratic people on earth. The found Jug fathers, therefore, especially bestowed them with a protection shield, the Fifth Schedule, described as ^constitution within constitution' Yet these communities were virtually criminalized on the dot with the adoption of our constitution. They have no place for the community and its customs and traditions. The Governors endowed with limitless powers for removing such dissonance, have remained unaware till date about the catastrophic impact of this lapse on their part on the life of the tribal people,
- (ii) The Union should be persuaded to publicly state its special responsibility towards the tribal people,
- (iii) Proposal for 'Peace Now\* should be initiated immediately,
- (iv) Honour, within one year, honestly all the promise that have been made to the tribal people and broken by the state,
- (v) Work out a comprehensive solution to confront the existing violence and chaos.

IN ORDER to ensure peace and justice, the following should be taken up urgently : measures

- (i) Land records in the tribal areas must be maintained properly so that the affected tribal don't have to suffer in case of any litigation.
- (ii) Eliminate Benami land holdings
- (iii) Surplus and reclaimed land be distributed among the tfibals along with financial assistance t6 rejuvinate productive agriculture. In this task proper utilizaiion of Waste land Reclamation Board will go a long way to mitigate the sufferings of the tribals.
- (iv) Draconian and colonial Land Acquisition Act should be reviewed and amended,
- (v) Ensure the payment or minimum wages,
- (vi) Scheduled Tribes & other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, should be implemented in letter and spirit,
- (vii) Abolition of Bonded Labour Act 1976, should be implemented strictly,
- (viii) Ensure easy and favorable credit facilities so that the moneylenders may not exploit the tribal people.

- (ix) Implementation of forest laws should have a human face, putty cases of violation of forest laws withdrawn, and proper implementation of the scheme ofjoint Forest Management (J. F. M.) should be ensured,
- (x) Customary laws of the tribals should be codified and respected.
- (xi) Protect and promote tribal languages.

Indigenous knowledge System of the tribal people, especially related to environment, medicine, and water management, should be documented and protected under Intellectual Property Rights,

- (xii) State to shun the obsession that whosoever supports the tribal cause is a Maoist or waging war against the State,
- (xiii) Restoration of peoples' right to live in dignity and freedom.

TODAY tribal cultures all over the world including India are 'wounded cultures'. Given the number, the tribal voice will remain marginalized in national politics. The local tribal communities trapped in unending cycles of brutal violence unleashed by Maoists, the State (security forces) and vigilante armed civilian such as Salva Judum and its incarnations by other names. arc groups Each group claims that their attacks are retributive and defensive, and that they have not initiated violence but none- of the groups can defend such a claim Further even armed struggle does not mean a license to loot and kill.

RIGHTLY or wrongly the left extremists have emerged as the voice of the oppressed tribal population. The Adivasis are not necessarily being inspired by Marxism/Maoism. They are with them because these ultra-left forces have mobilized the oppressed tribals and provided political leadership, fighting for the tribal rights. By all means,fault the left extremists for their shortcomings and crimes but they have to be respected for fighting against exploitation and oppression which should have been done by the State. Why should the exploited tribals wait patiently for a change in their lives while the prosperity of the already privileged rise astronomically and exponentially?
