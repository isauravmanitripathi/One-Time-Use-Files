### MADHYA PRADESH - CHATTISGARH

THE State of Madhya Pradesh occupies a very important place in tribal India. Though the state occupies sixth rank in terms of tribal percentage to the total population of the state, it tops the table in terms of tribal population in the country in absolute terms; the total tribal population in the state is about one crore and twenty lakh but does not exceed 23% of the total population of the state (1981 Census). The state of Madhya Pradesh shares its borders with seven states viz. Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Bihar. The result of this contagiousness is that several tribes of other states have also extended to various regions of Madhya Pradesh. Almost half of the districts of the state are important from the point of view of tribal population. Madhya Pradesh is not only the largest among the states in terms of geographical area but a very substantial segment of the state (around 33%) is under forest cover which is one of the important reasons for tribal concentration.

THE tribal population of Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh is divided into 58 large and tribes occupy the top place in terms of population: Bhils follow a close second and these two together constitute about two third of the total tribal population of undivided Madhya Pradesh. Among the remaining population of Kols and their sub groups/sub tribes constitute the largest segment. The districts of Jhabua, Bastar, Mandla, Dhar and Sarguja are tribal majority districts among which Bastar occupies number one place. The following table gives important figures with regard to tribal populations in twelve important districts.

TOIDAL INDIA

1 AE

A COMPREHENSIVE study of the tribal population of Madhya Pradesh is no easy task; here the tribes are divided into several overlappings causing a lot of confusion. The 1981 Census recognised 48 scheduled tribes in Madhya Pradesh with more than fifty sub tribes of Gonds having been recognised.

### List of Scheduled Tribes

Agariya, Aandh, Baiga, Bhains, Maria, Bhumiya, Bhuihar, Bhatra, Bhil, Bhilala, Bhujiya, Biyar, Bijhwar, Birhua, Birhor, Dhanwar, Gadaba, Gonda/Gond, Chalwa, Halvi, Kamma, Karaka, Kama, Charewa, Rathiya, Chatdi, Keet, Khaimar, Kharia, Kol, Kolam, Kodh, Khond, Koraku, Korwa, Majhi, Mahawar, Mawasi, Meena, Mongiya, Munda, Nagesia, Nat, Navdigar, Sapera, Kubuttar, Nihal, Oraon, Dhanka (including Dhangar), Panika, Pao, Pardhan/Pathari/Sarouti, Pardhi, Parja, Sahariya, Sauta, Saur, Savar/Saura, Sehariya, Sauj.

IN THIS special supplement on Madhya Pradesh an ethnographic account of two of the most important tribes is given below.

### THE BHILS

THE Bhils are considered as the largest tribe in India. They constitute (together with their all sub groups) about six million souls. The Bhils inhabit substantial area of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Gujarat. They also occupy some of the border areas of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. They are about fifteen lakhs in Madhya Pradesh alone.

FROM the point of view of their economic life they should be considered as settled cultivators although they are traditionally known as excelled archers. Geographically speaking, their traditional habitat has been the hills of Aravalli, Vindhyas, Satpura and Rewakantha plateau. It is believed that the word Bhil has been derived from the

word Bil from Dravidian language which mean bow; hence, the people with bow are Bhils.

THE skin colour of the Bhils is brownish dark, head hair a bit wavy with scant body hair. Most of the scholars consider them as Dravida while Guha included them among the proto-australoid. Bhils speak a variety of dialects resembling each other but with the respective regional tinge. Collectively speaking all these dialects may be put under the linguistic category of Bhilli, this collection of dialects contains substantial number of Mundari and Dravidian words but due to regional variations the impact of Gujarati, Marathi, and Marwari may also be seen. Among the traditional neighbours of Bhils who have influenced them are the Gonds, Bhuiya and Kolar tribes.

THE Bhils prefer to make their settlements on the small hillocks and live in huts. Most of their houses are built from wooden poles and wooden logs with the traditional Khaprail or clay slabs providing the ceiling. These houses lack the provision of windows, which is a striking feature of their settlement pattern.

## Social Organization

THE Bhils are divided into two exogamous moieties. These moieties in turn, are divided into numerous exogamous clans or gotras which are further divided into lineages composed of several families. The lineage may go back to 5-6 generations. The traditional family unit of Bhil is called as Vasilu. A family consists of male, his life and their unmarried children. With addition of some other kins it becomes an extended family. The head of the family is usually the eldest male member and all the earning members deposit their incomes in the common pool managed by the head of the family. They have a strong patriarchal setup and the eldest males authority is unassailable.

THE Bhils are strictly endogamous and those marrying outside the tribe may be excommunicated or penalised heavily or undergo both. They are lai^gely monogamous but a few of them may have more than one wife. However, polyandry is not practised at all. They practice cousin marriage as 'preferential marriages'. Widow remarriage is common and usually the widow marries her deceased husband's younger brother. If she wishes to marry anybody else, she is free to choose her life partner again. Likewise a widower usually marries his deceased wife's younger sister. Thus levirate and sororate

both are prevalent. Divorce is also common and in case of dissolution of marriage the children usually remain with their father.

THE rules of succession are such that the eldest son of the deceased gets the largest share and the youngest smallest with property being distributed proportionately according to age. The liabilities left by the deceased are also distributed in the same order. The daughters do not have any claim over the father's property.

GENERALLY speaking they cremate their dead while the children and those dying of unnatural causes are buried. The religious beliefs of the Bhils are largely based on animism or animatisim. They also believe in spirits and ancestor worship is also popular among them. After coming into contact with the Hindu society they have started observing festivals like Holi, Diwali, Dussehra, etc. but they continue to observe their traditional festivals. The ojhas or sorcerers occupy a special place in their society.

## Economy and Ecosystem

THE economy of the present Bhil society is based on agriculture though the outsiders tend to view them in their traditional image the nomads with exceptional hunting expertise. Earlier they used to do shifting cultivation but now they have switched over to settled cultivation. Their staple diet is maize while cotton is grown as cash crop. Besides these they also grow paddy, pulses, sugarcane, oilseed and wheat. The spirit of cooperation they display in various agricultural chores is been to be believed. The mutual cooperation at the time of harvest in known as helma.

THE occupations related with forests are an important aspect of the Bhils' economy. By being basically forest dweller they are expert hunters and they, are able to hunt even ferocious animals through very ordinary weapons. Perhaps that is why, they still cany an image of a tribe of expert archers. They are also woodcutters. They have no parallel in extracting honey, procuring the edible roots and fruits and gathering mahua. They also do fishing and practice poultry farming. They donot weave their cloths but purchase it from the market.

THE pressure of population, land grabbing and alienation of their land by the neighbouring peasantry, harassment and exploitation by the lower level forest officials, contractors and moneylenders haye made their life miserable. Though certain schemes of tribal development have made some dent, the life is still harsh.

## THE GONDS

THE Gonds constitute one of the laiigest segments of tribal India coming immediately after the Bhils. The Gonds consist of a group of tribal communities and they have been known to the people because of their colourful youth dormitories. The Gond tribal community inhabits a contagious geographical belt passing through Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, West Bengal, and Gujarat. However, their original place of habitation is considered to be Bastar region of Madhya Pradesh alone. They are divided into more than fif^ sub-tribes; and inhabit the plateau region of Madhya Pradesh (Mandla, Sewni, Chindwara and Betul) and Bastar region. They constitute more than half of the population of Mandla district.

ONE of the important features of this tribe is that they do not introduce themselves as Gonds but through their sub-tribal name or Kotar. The terms Koia, Koitov, or Kotor, in the local dialect stand for 'man of hills or mountains\*. Their traditional neighbours are the Baiga, Khond, Agariya, Bhumia and Gadaba tribes.

THE Gonds are dark complexioned people whose skin colour varies between chocolate brown to blackish. They have coarse, black and wavy hair with dark black eyes, thick lips and big nose. Guha has included them among Proto Ausatraloid group. They have their own language known as Gondi. Grierson is of the view that the Gonds use a variety of languages and dialects of the Dravidian language family. In several cases they have been observed to be fairly competent in using their neighbours' languages too. Mostly, they are bilingual.

IN THE settlement of their habitation and villages geographical conditions/factors play important role especially sources of water. In the hilly regions they prefer the top and in the plains river banks are their favourite locations. In the house construction the raw materials being available in the nearby forests are used. They make their huts by logs of wood, bamboo, grass and clay plaster. Traditionally they used to have youth dormitories known as Ghotul in the village or between 2-3 villages. Under the impact of modem civilization the institution of youth dormitories is fast declining (for details see a separate chapter on Youth Dormitory'). Also, every village has a provision of a guest house.

## Social Organization

AS ALREADY mentioned they prefer to introduce themselves by their sub-tribal names. In Bastar they are known as Maria or Muriya. They are divided into several clans (gotra) consisting of a number of families each. Family is the basic unit of their social organization. Generally the families are quite small but in some cases they may have large extended families. The eldest male member enjoys atmost authority. In their scheme of division of labour the adult male members do agriculture and hunting while the females perform all the domestic chores.

THE Gonds are generally monogamous. Keeping more than one wife may be due to the barrenness of the first wife or merely a way to flaunt one's high economic status. They practice tribal endogamy. The practice of levirate is prevalent among thenTand if any woman marries any other person except her deceased husbands' brother, he is to be compensated because of the practice of 'bride price'. Sororate is also popular among them. Matrimonial alliances may be established between distant cousins but parallel cousin marriage is forbidden. They do not practice child marriage. Divorce is permissible and this right may be exercised equally by the women folk. Widow remarriage is liked by the society.

GENERALLY speaking, the Gonds cremate their deads but .those dying of diseases or unnatural causes are buried. Their religious beliefs are based on animatism or animism but due to increasing, cultural contact with the Hindu society their pantheon has been undergoing radical changes and they are getting 'Hinduised'.

THE land under shifting cultivation is owned communally. Sons inherit their father's property and the daughters do not have property rights. In the division of property the house is generally given to the youngest son while the land is divided equally among all the sons. Among the sons whosoever takes the responsibility of the widowed mother and unmarried sisters gets the largest share in the property. In the absence of sons, all the property-moveable as well as immoveable-is divided among the sons-in-laws.

THEY live in villages and every village has its' own Panchayat. Besides other members, every Panchayat has two special membersone looks after public works and the second, religious affairs. Tribal issues are resolved through penal fines, etc.

## Economy and Ecosystem

GONDS are, by and large, self sufficient in various spheres of economic life. Though the majority of the Gonds have taken to settled cultivation, a section of them is still practicing shifting cultivation known locally as Penda and Dippi. Their chief crops are Kutvi, Kodo. Bajra, Urad and Moong while rice and Kutki are their staple diet. They are also fond of meat. Jungle fruits, fish and eggs.

THEIR main occupation used to be hunting but now it can be carried on only clandestinely and only on restricted scale. They are expert collectors of local and minor forest produce. They have been consuming chironji, honey, golar, mahua, etc. in substantial quantities but these days they are known only as collectors of Tendu leaves. Traditionally, they have been practising cattle rearing for meat consumption and transportation but they have now adopted piggery and poultry as important means of livelihood under various tribal development programmes. They make tools and implements of day to day use, themselves. Of late a substantial number of Gonds have taken to construction labour or mining. Like many other tribes, Gonds too are living under constant exploitation and harassment and this has been at the root of several minor and major tribal uprising in the central Indian tribal belt.

- 11. The data on the education levels attained by all STs show that the drop-out rate is high after primary level. It declines sharply from the middle level onwards. Similar trend has been shown by the major STs in attainment of education.
- 12. Out of total 35.1 lakh tribal children in the age group 5-14 years, only 16.1 lakh have been attending school, constituting 46 percent. As many as 18.9 lakh children in the corresponding age group have not been going to school. Among the major tribes, Gonds have more than 57.7 percent of the total children in the corresponding age group attend school; these proportions are below 50 percent among Kol, Korku and Baiga below 40 percent among Bhil and Sahariya.

### Work Participation Rate (WPR)

- 13. The Work Participation Rate (WPR) of the ST population is 50.5 percent, which is slightly higher than that of total STs at the national level (49.1 percent). There has been a mai^ginal decline of 1.3 percent in the tribal working population during 1991-2001. Male and female work participation rates among the tribal communities are 53.2 percent and 47.6 percent respectively.

## UTTAR PRADESH - UTTARANCHAL

UTTAR PRADESH has traditionally been centre of diverse castes, tribes, communities, religions and traditions. However, the tribal segment has been occupying the fringes of consciousness of the people living in this state. It is true that the culture of the 'elites' does not fit into the realm of the tribal culture but it is also correct that the so called elite culture has sprung from several of these tribal communities. The cultural evolution, thus, has seen ups and downs.

IT MAY sound strange to many but the fact remains that there were no Scheduled Tribes in Uttar Pradesh before 1967. It was only in this year that five tribes were declared as Scheduled tribes under Article 342 by the President of India. These are

- 1. Tharu
- 2. Bhoksa
- 3. Jounsari (Khasha)
- 4. Bhotia (Shauka)
- 5. Raji (Banravat)

THE total population of all these five scheduled tribes is 2.88 lakhs which comes to about 0.21% of the total population of Uttar Pradesh. However, the scheduled caste population is about 21.16% of the state's total population. The population growth of the scheduled tribes in the state between 1971-81 was only 17.19% while the average growth rate of the state's population was 25.49% during the same period.

ALL the five scheduled tribes are concentrated in the state's northern hilly areas and the neighboring Bhabbar and Terai regions. Population wise the Tharus are the largest tribe (1991:1,18558) and the Raji the smallest (1991: 755) tribe.

IN TERMS of district wise population 33% of the state's tribal population lives in Dehradun While another 32% inhabits Nainital. It means that about 65% of the total tribal population is concentrated in only two districts. These two districts are the original home of Tharus, Boksa and the Jounsaris. Among the remaining districts of the state Lakhimpur Kheri, Gonda, Bahraich, Bijnore, Pithoragarh and Chamoli are the home of a substantial number of Tharus, Bhotias and the Raj is.

APART from these scheduled tribes a substantial population of tribes also exists in the state. They inhabit the southern plateau of the state. Thus Mirzapur, Allahabad, Varanasi, Banda, Jhansi and Lalitpur such places inhabited by people who are primitive tribes in all respects but they have still not been brought under the protective umbrella of the Constitution by declaring them scheduled tribes while in the neighbouring Madhya Pradesh and Bihar members of the same tribes are scheduled tribes and their condition is definitely better than their counterparts living in Uttar Pradesh. Initially they were recognised as scheduled castes in 1950 but later on they were brought under a special category known as 'Non-Scheduled Tribes'. These tribes are as follows: are

- 1. Agariya
- 2. Baiga
- 3. Bhuiya/Bhuiyar
- 4. Chero
- 5. Gond (Dhuriya, Nayak, Pathari, Ojha, Rajgond)
- 6. Khairwar
- 7. Korwa
- 8. Kol
- 9. Majhwar
- 10. Oraon
- 11. Parhhathiya
- 12. Sahariya (Sahariya Rawat)

EXCEPT the Sahariya, almost all of these tribes are found in Mirzapur district. Their total population is about 3 lakhs and the Kols are the largest of these tribes, whose population is around sixty thousand only. The first step for their betterment is that they should be declared scheduled tribes immediately so that they begin enjoying all the facilities, and provisions under the Integrated Tribal Development Programmes (ITDP).

IN A recent development most of the tribal groups mentioned above and some others in Uttar Pradesh were put under the category of scheduled tribes vide The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Order (Amendment), 2002. Most of these tribal groups inhabit Maharajganj, Siddhartha Nagar, Basti, Gorakhpur, Dewaria, Mau, Azamgarh, Jounpur, Balha, Ghazipur, Varanasi, Mirzapur and

Sonbhadra districts of Uttar Pradesh. Thus, the newly listed scheduled tribes are : Gond, Dhuria, Nayak, Ojha, Pathari, Rajgond, Kharwar and Khirwar, Sahariya, Paraihya, Baiga, Pankha and Panika, Angaria, Patari, Cheru, Pahiya and Punhiya.

AFTER the creation of Uttaranchal only the Jharu and a section of Bhoksa remained in Uttar Pradesh. With the inclusion of the newly listed scheduled tribes, Uttar Pradesh has again emeiiged as an important place on the map of tribal India. There is an immediate need of research on these tribal groups.

## THE THARUS

THE Tharus are the largest of the five scheduled tribes of the state. They are spread over a vast tract between Nainital and Janakpur. They inhabit Nainital (Khatima and Sitaiganj tehsils) Lakhimpur Kheri/ Gonda, Bahraich and Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh; Champaran and Darbhanga districts of Bihar ; Jalpaigudi in Assam and in the region between Bhenchi and Mahakali in Nepal. About four lakh of them live in Nepal alone. According to the 1991 Census their total population was 1,18558 only. They claim their ancestry from Kirata and they are divided into several subgroups.

THE Tharus are usually short statured, yellow complexioned, broad faced and plain nosed people showing lot of signs of Mongoloid racial Stock. Some scholars regard them as descendants of the Rajputs while some others trace their origin to the Mongols of Central Asia. Their language seems to be highly influenced by Hindi and Nepali.

THEY extensively use logs of wood and bamboo for constructing their houses; perhaps this is because of the fact that their areas of habitation are flood prone. Usually their houses are built in northsouth direction with doors always opening towards the east

## Social Organization

MARRIAGE among the Tharus is settled usually through some mediator. Traditionally, they used to practice badla marriage in which marriage with each other's sisters was the usual mode of matrimonial alliance. Now Tern Tiki is becoming popular in which instead of marrying each other's sister, marriage with any near female relative is finalised. Although they are primarily monogamous, but polygyny may be practised.

THE practice of joint family among them is still very strong. The eldest, male member of the family serves as head of the family. They have got an elaborate division of labour and every membe^ of the family follows one's role seriously. The Tharus give more importance to their daughter-in-law than to their daughters. They strongly patrilineal, patriarchal and patrilbeal. are

THE kinship system of the Tharus resembles that of the neighboring Hindu society. Sex relations between close kins are prohibited. Joking relationship exists with one's younger brother's wife but avoidance is practiced with ones' wife's elder brother.

THEY have a biradari panchayat to maintain political organization. These are their rural courts. The der.berations in the panchayat are carried with the locally brewed liquor. Even dujfing arguments the 'Judges' keep on sipping the liquor. Traditionally/speaking no appeal be made against the judicial verdict of thqir local courts. , can

THE religious beliefs and the pantheon of tiie Tharus resemble those of the neighboring Hindus. They also believe in witchcraft and sorcery and offer the sacrifices of goat and pig to their deities except to Jagannathi devta who is offered milk only. They believe in about 36 deities. Among their major festivals are Dussehra. Diwali, Maghki Khitchri, Kanhaaiyya Ashtmi and Bajhar. They go on drinking and dancing spree both males and females, during Holi. Bajhar festival falls during rainy season and is celebrated more like a picnic with outdoor cooking and marrymaking.

THE Tharus bury their dead and observe daswan (tenth day after death) and Terhin (thirteenth day) rituals. When they return back after burial, they make a small bridge of clay on a crossroad believing that the spirit of the deceased shall be able to cross all the hurdles.

## Economy and Ek^osystem

THE Tharus are basically an agriculturist tribal community. They are also expert in fishing. The Tharus living along forest are also expert hunters. By and large the Tharus are considered to be lazy people lacking the spirit of adventure and dynamism. They have also not taken to modem means of cultivation despite lots of incentives. All transactions, right from sowing to harvest, are practised in traditional ways and new market forces have still not become effective. They live under subsistence economy.

FISHING has a special place in a Tharus' life. Males and females do fishing separately and females usually do not take fish touched

by the males. During rainy season they don't get fish because of fast currents and hence they do fishing in village ponds. Most of the Tharus are living in utter poverty and the saving, if any is spent on the consumption of local liquor. Spate of festivals and payment of bride price have further aggravated these conditions. A large number of Tharus remain chronically indebted and the moneylenders have cornered vast chunks of Tharus' land.

THE region inhabited by the Tharus is rampant with malaria and it has been taking a heavy tool. Repeated floods make their life more miserable; they become houseless and lose their cattle in laige number with diseases erupting ail around. Paucity of pure drinking water, lack of transport, communication and electrification and several other factors keep them educationally and economically backward.

THE Ministry of Welfare has been canying on a number of scheme of welfare and development with ITDP being prominent among these. These programmes have started showing results in several areas and the overall situation is not hopeless.

# THE BHOTIAS (Shauka)

IN THE border districts of Uttar Pradesh-Pithoragarh in Kumaon region and Uttarkashi and Chamoli in Garhwal region-live number of tribal and subtribal communities popularly known the Bhotia. The term Bhot has been derived from a Sanskrit word that stands for Tibet. The use of the word Bhotia (Tibetan) for the inhabitants of Indo-Nepal and Indo-Tibet border areas is not at all rational. Perhaps, that is why Rahul Sanskritayan has named this tribe as Bhotantik. a as

THE Bhotia is a generic name that includes the Shauka of Munsiari (Pithoragarh), Rang of Dharchula (Pithoragarh), Tolcha and Marchha of Niti and Mana Valleys (Chamoli) and Jaad of Harsil (Uttarkashi). But the fact of the matter is that all these groups prefer to be calledas Shauka. Among the communities which have seen lots of ups and downs, Shaukas may be considered as one of the prominent groups. Those who had been enjoying lot of affluence till early sixties because of trade and commerce are now forced to lead a miserable existence as a result of India-China War. They have started recovering a bit only after they were declared Scheduled Tribe in 1967.

THEIR stature varies between short to medium, fair complexion, straight brown hair, high cheekbones, epicanthic fold on the eyes and well built body are their important physical features. All these

feature point towards their affinities with mongoloid racial stock. Being inhabitants of higher altitudes their chest region is quiet voluminous. Generally, Shauka languages are included in the categoiy of Sino-Tibetan or Tibeto-Burmese language families. The elderly Shaukas are also conversant with Tibetan, Nepalese, Kumaoni, Garhwali etc. dialects.

BECAUSE of economic constraints the Shaukas have generally two houses which they inhabit according to seasonal cycles. During the summer season (May-October) they live in their villages located at the altitudes varying between 8,000 to 12,000 feet while during winters they migrate to lower altitudes. They prefer such places for their settlements as those which are not prone to such natural calamities as floods and glaciers. The traditional Shauka houses have slanting roofs and are usually double or triple storeyed-the ground floor is meant for cattle (goat and Jhebu /jeebu a hybrid of cow and yak) and their fodder, while the second storey is used for residential purposes. The third storey is generally for storage. Traditionally, a Shauka house is made of stone and logs of wood.

THERE are certain cultural diversities in the five above mentioned Shauka societies. For example the Shauka of Munsiari area are Kumaoni speaking while the remaining groups are having their own dialects; The Shaukas of Chaudans valley in Dharchula do not usually migrate arid live in settled villages; the Jaad Shaukas of Uttarkashi have a Buddhist temple (Gompa) which occupies an important place in their cultural life, while the Marchha of Mana valley are affiliated with the Hindu pilgrimage centre of Badrinath in one way or other.

EACH Shauka society on the basis of ritual purity is divided into two endogamous moieties which are known as Bharet and Kunkiya. The primary unit of society is family, the joint family being quiet popular among them. Being a patriarchal society the Shaukas are patrilineal and patrilocal. Generally, they practice village exogamy. They are forbidden to many within their own lineage locally called as Rath. There are several forms of marriage among the Shaukas but by and large the elderly people of the family finalise a marriage proposal. The elderly kins of potential bridegroom visit the to-bebride's place with the bottle of Chhang (the locally brewed rice beer), a red cloth and a couple of other gifts and initiate negotiations. Traditionally, the bride's father makes a formal refusal and gives his formal consent only after persistent persuasion by accepting the

gifts brought by the bridegroom's side. With this marriage preparations are started by both the parties. The practices of marriage by capUire and \* marriage by elopement' are rarely found. As a result of increasing culture contact with neighboring Hindu society they have started adopting the evil of dowiy. The divorce and remarriage are very common among them. Either of the parties may take initiative in the dissolution of marriage. The divorce proceedings are very simple; A thread is severed in the presence of elderly members of society and divorce is announced. The life is so harsh that a lonely woman cannot survive and hence remarriage of a divorced woman or a widow is quite common. The Shaukas generally follow monogamy but they may also be polygynous. The Jaad Shauka, to some extent, still practice polyandry. Kinship and kinship obligation are very important in the local Shauka society. Chaumasa (May-September) is usually the time of festivals during which the kins living even in distant villages visit each other. Because of the practice of village exogamy, migration and joint family, kinship is not merely a bundle of formal relations but is symbolic of the Shauka society's solidarity. The mutual economic relations are an important aspect of Shauka social organisation. Being a localised society virtually every Shauka is related with each other through consaguineal or affinal ties.

EVERY Shauka society has its own traditional political organisation on the basis of which all the political, economic, social and ritual quarrels are resolved. Generally, the punishment is in the form of mass feast, local beer or some cash. Every village or a cluster of villages or valley has a headman who supervises a panchayat consisting of the village elders locally known as Sayana. The decision of panchayat is generally impartial, irrevocable and binding on both the parties and anybody not confining to it may be ex-communicated. Till recently they were not carrying their affairs to the formal court of law. But the situation is fast changing.

THE Shauka society exhibits the impact of several religions. Traditionally speaking, they believe in animism and animatism but they have also observed some elements of Buddhism and Hinduism. Every lineage has its own deity, every village has its protector deity as will as the deities protecting land and crops. There is a great variety of deities, Gods and Goddesses. Every rock represents one Goddess or the other and numerous trees are the abodes of deities. They also offer the sacrifice of sheep to their deities and meat is consumed as deity's prasad.

## Economy and Ecosystem

THE traditional Shauka economy conforms to the migratory life. Till 1962 they used to go to the markets of Tibet during summers in connection with trade. They use to carry gur, rice, salt etc. and bring back wool, suhaga, some precious stones and herbs etc. It was based on barter and the Shaukas used to earn heavily. Just before the commencement of Indo-China War the Shaukas had to return from Tibet not as affluent traders but as shattered beggars. Thus began the agonising period of physical and mental tortures from which they have still not recovered, the Shaukas of Chaudans valley of Dharchula were settled cultivators and hence they remained unaffected by these changes.

WITH the migratory trade coming to an end the condition of the Shaukas became miserable. Education had never made any dent among the Shaukas and they were not conversant with any other trade or occupation. That is why this transitory phase proved to be very agonising for them. Gradually they reconciled with the contemporary realities, grappled with them and started tasting success. The pace of spread of education during the last three decades has been such that now-a-days virtually every Shauka village has a primary school and several degree colleges in the whole of the region. Several Shaukas are today doctors, engineers, teachers and officers. Some of them have established their own permanent shops while some have become contractors. A substantial number of them have also got employment through tourism especially through pilgrimages. Most of them do not prefer military service. The newly acquired status of a Scheduled Tribe has contributed a lot towards their betterment.

## BIHAR - JHARKHAND

THE undivided Bihar occupied a very important place in 'Tribal India'. In Chotanagpur plateau it contains a tribal belt covering some of the largest tribes of the countiy such as the Oraon, Munda, Ho, Santhals, etc. It also happens to be the nerve centre of the Jharkhand movement.

THE tribal population of undivided Bihar was around 8.7 million (1991 census) which comes about 10.06% of the total population of the state. Although, Bihar is placed at twelth position in terms of ranking of states by scheduled tribes percentage but in terms of absolute number it is behind only Madhya Pradesh and Orissa. Of the total scheduled tribe population of the countiy the tribals living in Bihar constitute about one fifth segment. Most of these tribes inhabit Ranchi, Hazaribagh, Dhanbad, Singbhum, Palamu and Santhal Paigana. Beside these, considerable tribal population is found also in Sahasram, Bhabhua, Bhagalpur, Mungher, Purnia and Champaran. Among the main and relatively known tribes Munda, Oraon, Ho, Santhal, Kharia, Pahariya and Birhor. come

LIKE the whole of the Tribal India, Bihar is not a monolith. It is the home of heterogenous types of tribes with different linguistic and racial affiliations, living at different levels of economic development. The Birhor and Hill Kharia are still food gatherer-hunters while the tribes like Asur, Korwa and Mai Pahariya practice shifting cultivation. The large tribes like Munda, Oraon, Ho, Santhal, etc. have transformed themselves into peasant societies. Beside belief in animism, the process of Hinduisation and spread of Christianity present important dimensions of their religious affiliation. Demographically speaking the lai^ge tribes show normal, consistent growth of population, among the relatively small tribes the population either stagnates or they are afflicted by depopulation.

## List of Scheduled Tribes

ASUR, Baiga, Banjara, Bathudi, Bedia, Bhumij, Binjhia, Birhor^N Biijia, Chero, Chukbaraika, Gond, Gorait, Ho, Karmali, Kharia, Kharwar, Khond, Kisan, Kora, Korwa, Loharor Lohar, Mahli, Mai Pahariya, Munda, Oraon, Parhaiya, Santhal, Saoria Paharia, ySawar and 'other tribes\* (unclassified). y

AMONG the above mentioned tribes the Asur, Birhor, Birjia, Savar, Hill Kharia, Korwa, Mai Pahariya, Pahariya and Sauria Paharia are the tribes living at an extremely under-developed stage and they have been classified as 'Identified Primitive Tribal Groups' for special treatment.

FOLLOWING are the brief ethnographic profiles of two of the scheduled tribes.

## SANTHAL

SANTHALS are a tribe of settled agriculturists. They are one of the largest tribes of India inhabiting a large tract of land spread over Bihar, Orissa and West Bengal with a total population of around four million people. Although, they are widely distributed in Bihar but their highest concentration is found in Santhal Paigana located in the eastern extremity of Chotanagpur Plateau in Bihar and this region is regarded as their traditional habitat. The whole region is rich in flora and fauna with a thick cover of foliage. Beside Santhal Parganas they also inhabit Bhagalpur, Mungher, Hazaribagh, Ranchi, Singbhum, Dhanbad and Palamu.

THE Santhals are believed to come from proto-australoid racial stock. Their skin colour varies between dark to dark brown; they have coarse, black, straight and occasionally curly hair. They have

broad head and are usually medium to short statured. They, are found to be highly laborious and enterprising as compared to their neighbouring tribes. They have their own language known as Santhali which belongs to the Munda language family. The Mundari language belongs to the Austro-Asiatic subfamily of languages. Though, Santhali has drawn from several languages but the influence of Bengali is most pronounced. The Santhals live in well settled villages. A Santhals village is usually small in size and it consists often to fifty households. Every village is divided into several 'tolas' which are headed by a 'mukhlya'. Most of the houses are veiy close or adjacent to each other with each of the doors opening in front of the street. The streets of these villages are usually so broad that a couple of bullockcarts may pass through them simultaneously. Most of their houses are made of clay with their ceilings made of wooden slabs and bamboos. Now the landscape may be seen dotted with a number of 'pucca' or brick cement housed. They maintain their houses in extremely neat and clean condition.

## Social Organization

THE Santhals arc divided into twelve patrilineal exogamous clans which are Hansda, Murmu, Kisku, Hemborm, Mandi, Soren, Tudu, Baske, Besra, Pauria, Chore and Bedea. All these clans are considered equals in terms of social status except Besra and Chero which are regarded relatively inferior. Mostly, they maintain nuclear or primary family consisting of husband, wife and their unmarried children. Some times some more kins are added to it such as married sons, wives and their children or married brothers and their wives and children make it some sort of extended type of family. The authority in the family lies with the senior most male member, in their scheme of division of labour the adult males perform the outdoor jobs while the females do household chores but their contribution to family economy is multifarious. The children also contribute to the family economy.

THE Santhals are usually monogamous. They go for polygyny in extreme conditions like the barrenness of wife or for any other important reason. Sometimes they are seen practicing sororate but cousin marriage is not allowed. The Santhals practice about a dozen ways of acquiring mates. Remarriage of widow and divorced women is not unusual but such marriages are performed without much fanfare and least ceremonial observances. Marriage may be dissolved

and both the parties enjoy equal right in the dissolution of mtsrriage. Adulteiy and practice of witchcraft usually culminate in divorce.

THE political organization of the Santhals rests over the village council or panchayat headed by a hereditary chieftain. If the council fails to resolve the problems or crisis the entire village sits over a meeting to sort out the matter. According to Santhal tradition those who clear the forest for village sites and cultivation had the right to the land but the situation has undergone radical changes after the enactment of the second National Forest Policy after independence. All property, movable as well as immovable, is divided equally among the sons on the death of the father. In the absence of the sons, the property goes to the brothers in equal proportionr. Women have no right of inheritance.

THE pantheon of the Santhals consists of numerous gods, deities and spirits. Rituals and ceremonies are abundant. Their presiding deity is known as Thakur, the creator of the universe. They arc staunch believers in magic, sorcery and witchcraft. Sorcery occupies an important place in their cultural life and they believe in curing many diseases through sorcery. Females are regarded experts in tills craft. The Santhal religion has undergone considerable changes as a result of persistent cultural contacts with the neighbouring peasamy. The Santhals cremate their dead.

## Economy and £k:o-system

SANTHALS are primarily agriculturists who have gradually, over a period of time, transformed themselves into peasanty. They raise sorghum, maize, millet, pulses, cotton and rice depending upon different kinds of land in different seasons of the year. They employ bullocks and buffalo for ploughing. Although, they have developed an artificial system of irrigation through embankments constructed across ravines, hollows, or other natural depressions, they still mainly depend on rainfall. Female workforce is a crucial input in their agricultural operations. As supplementary food or at the time of scarcity certain forest plants—^flowers, fruits and young shoots arc eaten raw or cooked. Among such plants come sal. mahua, bamboo, etc.

THEY are also fond of hunting and fishing. They also practice domestication of chickens, pig, goat, cow, buffalo, sheep, etc. which beside their flesh are also considered useful for their bye products, besides rice beer, known as handia, they also consume 'hard' liquor

distilled from mahua flowers. They also smoke bidi made on the locally grown saal leaf. BECAUSE of rise of population and land alienation on laige scale, Santhals are no more a happy lot. Their existence (except that of 'elite') is characterised by chronic indebtedness, land alienation, migration and harassment by landlords, contractors and moneylenders. A number of Santhals have also taken to work in coal mines. A majority of the migrant Santhals have become unskilled labour.

### BIRHOR

BIRHORS are considered to be one of the most economically backward tribes of laigely food gatherers-hunters. They have been included in the special category of primitive tribal groups.' They inhabit the fringes of the south-eastern region of Chotanagpur plateau and Palamu. The whole region is replete with small hills rich in vegetation and forest cover. The Birhors have become a depopulating tribe whose population shows a consistent decline. The result of this phenomenon is that they have been reduced to about five thousand souls divided into around seven hundred households.

THE Birhors are put under the category of proto-australoids with some marked negroid features like dark complexion, slightly curly hair, broad nose and medium to short stature. They speak a language from Austaro-Asiatic family but due to their cultural contacts with their neighbouring tribes such as the Santhals, Mundas and Hos they also show familiarity with their languages.

## Social Organization

BIRHORS are mainly divided into two groups viz: Uthalo and Janghi. The Uthalo lead mainly nomadic existence while the Janghi have almost adopted a sedentry life. The former keep on changing their abode almost every month except during the rainy season. The popular term for the habitation is tanda and each tanda consist of about ten huts. Some of them also keep goats and some other cattle. Each tanda is headed by a chief known as Naya who holds religious and temporal authority. The social distance between these two categories of Birhors is fast widening and they have virtually stopped sharing meals or establishing matrimonial alliances.

THE Birhors maintain nuclear family. Parents and the minor children live together in a hut while those above 10-12 years sleep in the

dormitory know as Gatiora. Boys and girls sleep in separate youth dormitories. Though they practice monogamy but there is no bar on polygyny. They do not practice child marriage. The disputes are resolved by the local panchayat which is usually a council of elders of a temporary nature and may be constituted and reconstituted frequently with every case/dispute.

THE Birhors have a large pantheon and Bora Bonga is the presiding deity. Virtually every forest, orchard and fountain is the abode of their one deity or the other. Propitiation of various deities through ritual observances is an integral part of their religion.

## Economy and £co-System

THEIR economic activities rotate around gathering-hunting. They go to jungle in groups and do collection of edible roots-fruits and hunting. The females usually stay back and perform household chores beside looking after the children. They are very fond of eating mahua flowers; they also consume monkey's flesh. Among the fruits they fondly consume mango's, tamarind etc. The Birhors also keep domesticated animals such as chickens and goats; some times they also keep pigs. Dog is their fevourite animal and is their best friend and companion who helps them in their hunting expeditions beside performing the role of 'watchman'. They are expert string weavers and makers of wooden items which they dispose off in the nearby markets. Catching monkeys is also one of dieir chief means of livelihood.

SINCE the Birhors live by forest economy and forests provide their resource base they have been hit hard by the growing depletion of forests. The subsequent National Forest Policies have been curtailing the rights of the forest dwellers. Their distorted and sometime inhuman interpretation by the forest officials have made the life of the forest dwelling tribes miserable. The Birhors too are no exception to this trend. They seem to have lost the battle.

## ANDHRA PRADESH-TBLANGANA

ANDHRA Pradesh has got a fairly large tribal population. Though, in terms of ranking of states by scheduled tribes concentration, it is placed at 13th position, it has the largest concentration of tribal population in south India. This tribal population is of the size of 4.75 millions which comes about 7% of the total population of Andhra Pradesh. The implication of this seemingly ordinary fact is quite important, it means that about seven out of every hundred persons in Andhra Pradesh come from a scheduled tribe.

THE demographic scenario of Andhra tribes is also interesting. On the one hand there are such 'major' tribes like Yenadi and Koya which exceed two lakh souls alongwith other tribes like Yerukala, Kondh, Konda Reddi and Gond which exceed a lakh each and on the other hand there are tribes like Rona, Kulia, Kattunayakan and Bhil who are found in hundreds, the Rona being the smallest consisting of just 12 souls.

THE tribal world of Andhra Pradesh is not a monolith even in term of their economic development. It consists of tribes living at different levels of technology and pursuing different types of economies. While the tribes like Chenchu and Yenadi arc pursuing gathering hunting economy, Goudu and Sugali are pastoralists; Kammara, Kulia, Thoti, Pradhan and Yerukala are artisan tribes; Konda Dora. Konda Reddi, Kolam, Khond and Saora follow simple/primitive agricultural economy while the tribes like Bagatha, Koya, Gond, etc. have transformed themselves Into tribal-peasantry.

### List of Scheduled Tribes

/^NDH, Bagatha, Bhil, Chenchu, Gadaba, Gond, Kammara,^ Kattunayakan, Kolam, Konda dora, Konda Reddi, Kondh, Kotia, Koya, Kulie, Mali, Manne Dora, Muka [)ora, Naikpods, Nayak, Pradhan, Paraya. Reddi Dora, Rona'Rena, Saora, Sugali, Thoti, \^Valmiki, Yenadi, Yerukala. ^

THE distribution of tribal population in Andhra Pradesh may be understood through two broad categories viz. Agency Areas and the Plains. Thp Agency Areas are also known as Partially Excluded Areas. The^ are largely mountaneous areas with dense foliage and somb ditficult terrain while the Plain Areas are mostly level land. Historically sj^eaking the Agency areas symbolize the retreat of the primitive tribes in the face of invasion of land hungry Hindu peasantry. The Agency Areas are spread across parts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, West Godavari, Khammam, Warangal, Adilabad, and Mehbub nagar. Some of the important tribes inhabiting the Agency Areas are the Andh, Bagatha, Khond, Kolam, Konda Dora, Konda. Reddi, Kotiya, Koya, Kulia, Mali, Manne Dora, Muka Dora, Naikpod, Poraja, Pradhan, Reddi Dora, Saora, Thoti and Valmiki. Even these Agency Areas are no more our of bound for the non-tribal population and many such people have started settling down in these exclusive areas. Some of the important tribes of the Plains Areas are Kattunayakan, Rona, Sugali, Yenadi and Yerukala.

AS FOR as the distribution of linguistic elements is concerned the tribal population may be classified into three groups. The largest group of tribes belong to Dravidian language family, followed by those speaking languages from Indo-European and Austric family of languages. Because of growing cultural contacts with different types of people many tribes have become bilingual. As for as the ethnographic profile is concerned the Chenchu have been described in detail in the preceding chapter on the ethnographic profiles of the selected Indian Tribes.

- 3. The growth rate of ST population in the decade 1991 -2001 19.6 percent has been higher if compared to the overall growth rate of 14.6 percent of the state population as a whole. Among the numerically major STs, highest growth rate of 36 percent has been recorded in the case of Sugalis, followed by Koya (24.4 percent), Gond (18.9 percent), Yenadis (16.8 percent) and Yerukulas (12.8 percent). at

## Population- Size & Distribution

- 4\*. Out of the 33 STs, Sugalis are numerically the largest ST with a population of 2,077,947 constituting 41.4 percent of the state's ST population. They are followed by Koya 568,019 (11.3 percent), Yenadis 462,167 (9.2 percent), Yerukulas 437,459 (8.7 percent) and Gond 252,038 (5 percent). These five (5) STs together account for 76 percent of the ST population of the state.
- 5. Of the total ST population, 92.5 percent are residing in rural areas. Among the major STs, Gond have the highest (97.6 percent) rural population, followed by Koya (95.5 percent), Sugalis (93.7 percent), Yenadis (86.4 percent) and Yerukulas (77.5 percent^ District-wise distribution of ST population

shows that they are mainly concentrated in the districts of Khammam, Visakhapatnam, Warangal, Adilabad and Nalgonda. These five districts constitute 48.9 percent of the total ST population of the state.

#### Sex ratio

6. The overall sex ratio of the ST population is 972 females per 1000 males, which is maiiginally lower than 97« reported for the state population as a whole at 2001 Census. The over all sex ratio of the ST population has registered an increase over 960 reported at the 1991 Census. The sex ratio of above 1000 among ST population in the five contiguous districts namely, Srikakulam (1009), Vizianagaram (1025), Visakhapatnam (1003), East Godavari (1011) and West Godavari (1018) have returned higher sex ratio among STs. In the remaining 18 districts it varies between 994 (Nizamabad) and 921 (Nalgonda).

The Statement below shows the sex ratio and child sex ratio (0-6) at the national, state and numerically the largest five STs at 2001 Census:

| Age<br>Groups | All STs<br>(India) | Ail STs<br>(Andhra<br>Pradesh) | Sugalis | Koya | Gond | Yenadis | Yerukulas |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|---------|------|------|---------|-----------|
| All Ages      | 978                | 972                            | 939     | 1006 | 1013 | 957     | 984       |
| 0-6           | 973                | 972                            | 944     | 1000 | 999  | 950     | 971       |

7. As shown in the statement, the child sex ratio (0-6) of ST population of Andhra Pradesh is equal to the child sex ratio of ST population at the national level. Among the numerically major STs, Sugalis and Yenadis have lower sex ratio both in overall and 0-6 age group populations than the state ST population and the other major STs.

### Literacy and educational level

8. Literacy and level of education are two basic indicators of the level of development achieved by a group/society. The literacy results in a more awareness besides contributing to the overall improvement of health, hygiene and other social conditions.

According to 2001 Census, percentage of literate persons (those who can read & write with understanding). aged 7 years and above, among ST population of Andhra Pradesh is 37 percent, which is lower than 60.5 percent reported for state population as a whole. The literacy data show that the ST population of the state has made significant improvement in literacy during the decade 1991-2001. The literacy rate, which was 17.1 percent in 1991, has increased by 19.9 percentage points in 2001. But in comparison to other states/ UTs, the position of ST population of Andhra Pradesh is not satisfactory. It is just above Uttar Pradesh (35.1 percent) and Bihar (28.2 percent), which are bottom two states in literacy rate for ST population among all states/UTs. At the district level, the highest literacy rate has been recorded in Hyderabad (55.4 percent) and the lowest in Mahbubnagar (25.8 percent).

- 9. Among the major STs, Yerukulas have reported the highest literacy rate (45.4 percent), followed by Koya (41.8 percent), Gond (36.4 percent), Yenadis (35.3 percent) and Sugalis (34.3 percent). The female literacy rate of 26.1 percent among the ST population is matter of concern as almost a fourth of ST females are illiterate in the state.
- 10. Out of total literates, 48.3 percent are literates without any educational level or have attained below Primary level. The literates, who have attained education up to Primary level and Middle level, constitute 28.4 percent and 8.5 percent respectively. 12.3 percent are having educational level up to Matric/Higher Secondary etc. levels, implying that every 8<sup>th</sup> ST literate is a Matriculate. Literates with educational level of Graduation & above are 1.8 percent. Individually, Yerukulas (3.3 percent) have the highest percentage of Graduate & above educational level.
- 11. The educational level table also shows that the drop out is conspicuous after the Primary level and again after Matric/ Secondary levels. This pattern is consistent among all the maior SCs.
- 12. Population in the age group 5-14 years are the potential students. Only 60.7 percent of the ST population in this age group has been attending various educational institutions.

### Economic activity Work Participation Rate (WPR)

- 13. The work participation rate (WPR) is the percentage of workers to the total population. The WPR of the ST population is 53.9 percent at 2001 Census, which is almost equal to 54.3 percent recorded in 1991. The WPR among male 55.7 percent and females 52 percent more than half of male/female have been returned workers among ST at 2001 Census.
- 14. At the individual caste level by & laige consistent pattern is noted in WPR. The highest WPR of 56.5 percent is reported for Yenadis and lowest among Yerukulas (50.5 percent). Yurukulas have also recorded the lowest female WPR of 45.2 percent.

### Category of Workers

- 15. There has been a decline in the main workers from 93.9 percent at 1991 Census to 79.3 percent at 2001 Census. This, in turn, has resulted in corresponding increase in the maiginal workers from 6.1 percent in 1991 to 20.7 percent in 2001. Out of total workers, 'agricultural labourers' constitute 49.3 percent, which is significantly higher when compared to 36.9 percent recorded for ST population at the national level. 'Cultivators' accounts for 34.3 percent and 13.5 percent have been returned as 'other workers'. Remaining 3 percent have been workers in 'household industiy'.
- 16. At the individual caste level, among major STs, Yenadis have the maximum 76.2 percent 'agricultural labourers'.

#### Marital status

- 17. Marital status is one of the important determinants of fertility and growth of a population. The 2001 Census data on marital status show that 48.7 percent persons among the STs of Andhra Pradesh are 'never married'. The 'currently married' constitute 46.9 percent while 4 percent are 'widowed' and only 0.5 percent are 'divorced and separated'.
- 18. A majority of girls and boys among STs in Andhra Pradesh are getting married after attaining the legal age of marriage. However, marriages of ST girls below 18 years (3.2 percent) are higher than that recorded among ST population at national

TRIBAL IND1A\_203

level (2.1 percent). Similarly, the incidence of marriage among boys below 21 years at 3.6 percent is also higher than 2.8 percent aggregated for ST population at the national level.

19. The mean number of children ever born per ever married ST woman of all ages as well as 45-49 years age group are 2.7 and 3.6 respectively, which are lower than corresponding figures of 3.2 and 4.1 for ST population at the national level.
