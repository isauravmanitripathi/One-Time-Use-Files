WHAT is a tribe? What exactly are the criteria for considering a human group, a tribe? What are the indices of the tribal life ?

INTERESTINGLY but sadly the anthropologists, sociologists, social workers, administrators and such people who have been involved with the tribes and their problems either on theoretical plane or on practical grounds are still not on the same wave length regarding the concept and the definition of their subject matter. Arthur Wilke, et al (1979) puts the problem in proper perspective by stating that for years ambiguity has stalked India's official portrait of tribal people. From 1917 through the 1931 Census, for instance, the nomenclature referring to tribes under-went successive modifications, involving primarily changes in descriptive adjectives such as "aboriginal" or "depressed classes". By the 1941 Census, these qualifying adjectives were dropped, a practice continued after independence with the adoption of the notion of scheduled tribes or as they are commonly called, Adivasi. Such standardization did not, however, remove all ambiguity.

NO DOUBT with the passage of time, the differences on the concept and definition of a tribe have certainly narrowed down to an appreciable extent, but a theoretical discussion seems imperative to understand this problem in its proper perspective.

HERE are a few definitions of tribe' being used as the basis of discussion in the present chapter :

A TRIBE is a collection of families bearing a common name, speaking a common dialect, occupying or professing to occupy a common territory and is not usually endogamous, though originally it might have been so. -Imperial Gazetteer of India

A TRIBE is a group of people in a primitive or barbarous stage of development acknowledging the authority of a chief and usually regarding themselves as having a common ancestor.

-Oxford Dictionary

IN ITS simplest form the tribe is a group of bands occupying a contiguous territory or territories and having a feeling of unity

deriving from numberous similarities in culture, frequent contacts, and a certain community of interest. -Ralph Linton

A TRIBE is an independent political division of a population with a common culture. -Lucy Mair

A TRIBE is a group united by a common name in which the members take a pride by a common language, by a common territory, and by a feeling that all who do not share this name are outsiders, 'enemies\* in fact.

## -GW.B. Huntingford

A TRIBE is a social group with territorial affiliation, endogamous, with no specialization of functions, ruled by tribal officers, hereditaiy or otherwise, united in language or dialect, recognizing social distance with other tribes or castes, without any social obloquy attaching to them, as it does in the caste structure, following tribal traditions, beliefs and customs, illiberal of naturalization of ideas from alien sources, above all conscious of homogeneity of ethnic and territorial integration. -D.N. Majumdar

IDEALLY, tribal societies are small in scale, are restricted in the spatial and temporal range of their social, legal, and political relations, and possess a morality, a religion, and world-view of corresponding dimensions. Characteristically too, tribal languages are unwritten, and hence, the extent of communication both in time and space is inevitably narrow. At the same time, tribal societies exhibit a remarkable economy of design and have a compactness and selfsufficiency lacking in modem society. -1. M. Lewis

MAJUMDAR & Madan (1967) rightly comment that when one looks into the definitions given by various anthropologists, one is bound to be impressed by the dissimilarity of their views as regards what constitutes a tribe. Kinship ties, common territoiy, one language; joint ownership, \_ one political oiganization, absence of internecine strife have ail been referred to as the main characteristics of a tribe. Some anthropologists have not only accepted some of the characteristics, but have also stoutly I denied some of them to be characteristics of a tribe. Thus, Rivers did not mention habitation in a common territory as a vital feature of tribal oiganization, although others like Perry have insisted on it, saying that even nomadic tribes roam about within a definite region. Radicliffe Brown has given instances of one section of a tribe fighting another from his Australian data. The only conclusion one can draw from such diversity of

learned opinion is that the views of each anthropologist arise from the type of data with which he is most familiar. One may, therefore, make a list of universal characteristics, some of which would define a tribe anywhere. Thus, Majumdar claims universal applicability of his definition given on the preceding page.

A MAJOR hurdle of defining a tribe is that related with the problem of distinguishing the tribe from peasantry. "It is no doubt possible to use the labels 'tribaf and 'peasant' for this type of social oi^ganization and to characterise one by contrasting it with the other. But in spite of all the effort invested by anthropologists in the study of primitive societies, there really is no satisfactory way of defining a tribal society. What this amounts to in the Indian context is that anthropologists have tried to characterise a somewhat nebulous sociological type, by contrasting it with another which is almost equally nebulous. Earlier anthropologists had not paid sufficient attention to define tribal society, but tacitly assumed that what they were studying in Australia, Melanesia and Africa were various forms of tribal society. The tribe was somewhat vaguely assumed to be a more or less homogeneous society having a common government, a common dialect and a common culture" (Andre Beitelle, 1973). Though not everybody will agree with the assumption of Beitelle but his statement maybe cited as one of the many schools of thought grappling with the problem.

MOST of the above mentioned definitions present a static definition of tribe. B.K. Roy Burman (1994) presents a refreshingly new idea of defining and identifying 'tribe'. He is of the view that a tribe should be understood in in terms of a stage in the techno-economiccultural evolution and relationship of man with nature. Once a group of people goes beyond this stage, it ceases tobe a 'tribe' though it may continue to retain its ethnic or 'tribal' identity. Even this approach may be debatable because those who wish to identify or define tribe in these terms may be accused of imposing their model of techno-economic development.

THE above discussion shows that it is not easy to define a tribe or a tribal society conclusively and any standardization in this regard is very difficult to obtain. Hence, it will be better to shy away from international or universal plane keeping in view the regional connotation of the concept of tribe and focus attention on gaining standardization within the Indian universe to solve our own problems. This seems to be quite sensible in the situation when definitions of universal applicability are either very broad and loose or very narrow

and restricted. In this context, Andre Beitelle (ibid) aptly remarks that Bailey is perhaps the only anthropologist working in the Indian field who has tried to characterize tribes in terms of segmentaiy principles, but the contrast in which he is interested is not between 'tribe' and 'peasant' but between 'tribe' and 'caste'. Further, unlike Bailey, the majority of Indian anthropologists have not given much serious thought to the problem of creating a definition of tribal society which will be appropriate to the Indian context.

NOW let us examine the problem specifically in the India context. T. B. Naik (1960) raises the problem in proper perspective by talking of the Criteria and indices of the tribal life in specifically Indian setting. What should be the criteria and indices of tribal life? Living in forest? The Dublas of Surat and a host of others do not live in forests. They live in fertile plains, nevertheless they are included in the Schedule. Primitive religion ? But you do not know what primitive religion is in India, there being a continuance from the most abstruse philosophy to the tribal gods and superstitious beliefs in the religion of most of the advanced communities of India". This index being very fluid and not exact will not do. Geographical isolation? There are hundreds of tribal groups who are not living an isolated life. Primitive economic system? There are many peasant groups who are living by equally primitive economic system. Thus, Naik goes on to present his own criteria for a tribe which are as follows :

- /. A tribe to be a 'tribe' should have the least functional interdependence within the community (the Hindu caste system is an example of high interdependence).
- 2. It should be economically backward, which means :

(i) the full import of monetary economics should not be understood by its members;

00 primitive means of exploiting natural resources should be used;

(Hi) the tribe's economy should be at an underdeveloped stage; and

(iv) it should have multifarious economic pursuits.

- 3. There should be a comparative geographic isolation of its people from others.
- 4. Culturally, members of a tribe should have a common dialect which may be subject to regional variations.
- 5. A tribe should be politically oiganized and its community Panchayat should be an influential institution.

- 6. The tribe\*s members should have the least desire to change. They should have a sort of psychological conservatism making them stick to their old customs.
- 7. A tribe should have customaiy laws and its members might have to suffer in a law court because of these laws.

NAIK further elaborates that a community to be a 'tribe' must have all these attributes. It might be undergoing acculturation, but the degree of acculturation will have to be determined in the context of its customs, gods, language, etc. a very high degree of acculturation will automatically debar it from being a tribe.

EHRENFELS elaborates some of the points already discussed by saying:

- 1. A community, however small it may be, may remain in isolation from the other communities within a geographical region. This applies to a caste as well as to a tribe. The members of a true tribe, however, are generally not included into the traditional Hindu caste hierarchy and frequently speak also a common dialect, entertain common beliefs, follow common occupational practices and (most important) consider themselves as members of a small but semi-national unit.
- 2. / would delete in the above definition the words "economically backward", and substitute them by the words "self—sufficient" (ofKhasi, Gond, Bhil, Agaria and others who are in part more specialized economically, even much more than their nontribal neighbours). Yet each individual of a tribe may work for his family group and thus may remain functionally dependent of solidarity with the tribe as a whole, rather than as a co-partner in the caste hierarchy of non-tribal Hindus. primitive means" and "underdeveloped stage
- 3. I agree with the definition of geographical isolation though not every tribe is an isolated unit of people (e.g., Bhil, Santhals, Irula, etc.). But if a tribe has its own system of economy, its solidarity will no doubt be more stable.
- 4. Common dialects or languages are typical for tribes in Assam and the Central areas, but not in the Southern and Western States of India. Community of language stresses that, but is not imperative for building up tribal consciousness. The original religious concepts of most tribes in preacculturation days were different from their Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim or Christian neighbours, but are not always so now.

- 5. A tribe need not always be politically organized nor have a community panchayat. It may, or may not, have a single chief or a few elders who may wield more or less power within the community.
- 6. I would delete the relevant para of the above and substitute it with the words, "Tlie members of a tribe have a feeling, of belonging to a group the existence of which is valuable.\*\*
- 7. Almost all tribes h^ve customary laws and practices, more or less different from their non-tribal neighbours. Very often they are indeed made to suffer on this account in law courts and in other contact situations with non-tribals.

THE Tata Institute of Social Sciences in its report on the Indian tribes has also joined those who have been criticising the anthropologist\*s approach of the problem. It says that the (anthropological) criteria apply to ideal typical tribal communities as conceived by the anthropologists for theoretical purpose. These do not appear to be empirically related to communities that have been included in the list of the scheduled tribes. The logical implication seems to be, that communities which do not satisfy the above criteria should not be considered as tribes even though they are included in the list of the scheduled tribes. Arthur Wilke et al (1979) too, like some others, opine that some measure, if not a substantial measure, of the difficulty is inherent in the intellectual legacy of the discipline of anthropology. Aiyappan, provoked by such statements remarks rather skeptically, reminding us of the wellknown definition given by Tate Regan of 'species\*. Adopting the definition he (Aiyappan) said that a tribe is a group which a competent anthropologist considers to be a tribe. If the administrator wants a clear-cut definition which he can apply blindly and get along with, he says, we should tell him that we don\*t have it, just as the zoologist is not in a position to give a clear-cut all-purpose definition of 'species\*.

DESPITE such rhetoric and academic polemics on the problem of definition of 'tribe\* quite a substantial measure of standardization has been accomplished in designating which people are or are not entitled to particular protection and privilege. This could become possible only due to vigorous academic efforts of the much maligned and misunderstood anthropologists who, with the help of rigorous and painstaking empirical research, ultimately came out with definite and empirically verifiable ethnographic data to clear the cobwebs of misgivings regarding Indian tribes. Majumdar and Madan (1967)

demonstrate this new mood by emphatically stating the following facts :

- 1. In tribal India, a tribe is definitely a territorial group; a tribe has a traditional territory, and emigrants always refer to it as their home. The Santhals working in the Assam tea gardens refer to particular regions of Bihar or Bangal as their home.
- 2. All members of a tribe are not kin of each other, but within every Indian tribe kinship operates as a stong, associative regulative and integrating principle. The consequence is tribal endogamy and the division of a tribe into clans and sub-clans and so on. These clans, etc., being kin groups, are exogamous.
- 3. Members of an Indian tribe speak one common language, their^own or/ and that of their neighbours. Intra-tribal conflict on a group scale is not a feature of Indian tribes. Joint ownership of property, wherever present, as for instance among the Hos, is not exclusive. Politically, Indian tribes are under the control of the State governments, but within a tribe there may be a number of Panchayats corresponding to the heterogeneity, racial and cultural, of the constituent population in a village or in adjacent villages.
- 4. There are other distinguishing features of Indian tribes. Thus, there are their dormitory institutions; the absence of institutional schooling for boys and girls; distinctive customs regarding birth, marriage, and death; a moral code different from that of Hindus and Muslims; peculiarities of religious beliefs and rituals which may distinguish tribesmen even from he low caste Hindus.

It may also be important to have a look at the toxonomical exercise of anthropologists primarily focusing on the cultural process. B.K. Royburman (1970) classified the Indian tribes in terms of their Orientation towards the Hindu society :

- (a) Those incorporated in the Hindu Social Order In this categoiy he Includes tribe^like Bhil, Bhumij etc. who have accepted the ethos of the taste structure and can hardly be differentiated from the neighbouring Hindu peasantry,
- (b) Positively Oriented towards the Hindu Social Order He includes tribes like the Santhal, Oraon, Munda, Gond etc. under this who alongwith a number of other tribal communities of Central India are positively oriented towards the Hindu social order.

(c) Negatively oriented towards the Hindu Social Order Tribal Communities like the Mizo and the Naga may be considered to be negatively oriented towards the Hindu Social Order. Tliey definitely reject caste as framework for social organization,

(d) Indifferent towards the Hindu Social Order

Most of the tribal communities in Arunachal Pradesh can be considered to be indifferent to Hindu Social Order. They hardly aware of the tenets of Hinduism. Many of them traditionally eat beef and their moral constraints and systems of pollution and purity do not appear to bear any significant degree of resemblance to those of the Hindus. This classification too is vulnerable on several counts. are

TO WIND up this discussion, it seems to be quite apt to refer Arthur Wilke et al (1979) who opine that even the constraints of bureaucratic decision-making and administration reign supreme, there is a tendency to gloss over the rich and at times puzzling mosaic of human affairs. What accounts for indetermination in the concept of tribe is likely that the dictates of bureaucratic procedures and the unceasing acculturation going on throughout India and particularly among many identified tribal people make it difficult to apply idea which is in many respects, ideal type formulation. to an
