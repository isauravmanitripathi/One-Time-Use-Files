# The Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (as amended up to 1998) â€” A Review

Be Land Acquisition Act of 1894 was primarily enacted to ensure that in matters related to land, the role of the Collector was decisive and his award was to be accepted as final except when altered by a decree in a regular suit by the Court. This Act also dispensed with assesses who helped in valuation of land along with the judge in acquisition process was made elaborate and the Collector more powerful.

# The Process of Land Acquisition

The Land Acquisition Act is used to acquire land which is privately owned. The Act describes the circumstances and purposes for which the Central and state governments acquire land. According to this Act, the process of acquiring land may be categorized into four stages.

#### Stage I

A Preliminaiy notification is issued by the government stating that particular land is needed or may be needed for '1 public purpose or for a company (Section-4). The notice which is a public notice is required to be published in three ways.

- <sup>1</sup> . I^\*the Central Government intends to acquire the land then the notice must be published in the Gazette of India and if the state intends to acquire the land then it must be published in the gazette of that state.
- 2. The notice must be published in at least two newspapers of which must bi in a regional language. , one
- 3. The Collector is required to post the gist of the notice at convenient public places and other conspicuous places in the village or town in which the land is located. This notification IS essentially to enable the government to survey the land in

order to establish its suitability for the said purpose. Any officer authorised by the government may carry out this process.

It is imperative to note that any person interested 2 who has an objection to the said intention, may under Sjiction 4(1) file his/her objection, in writing, within 30 days to the Colledtor who is required to give the objector an opportunity of being heard and to record the reasons for the collector's decision in this regard. %te report of the Collector is filed to the 'appropriate govemmenf' who% decision is final.

#### Stage II

The government is required to make a formal declaration of the intended acquisition. The publication of this declaration is to be done in the same manner as the intention notification, i.e., in the official gazette, iin two newspapers and posting notices in public places in the viliage/town where the land in question is located (Section 6).

The decla^tion must state inter alia the district, the approximate area and the public purpose for which the land is needed. Also if a plan of the said piiipose has been prepared then the place where the plan can be inspected should be stated. In case the land is being acquired for a company then the details of the company should be stated.

Thereafter, the Collector is to take the order from the Government for acquisition and the land is to be marked out, measured and planned (Section 7, 8).

### Stage ni

This stage involves:

- a) giving a public nqtice at convenient places and individual notices to the persons interested in the land to be acquired to file claims for compensation. (Section 9).
- b) inquiiy into the iheasurements, value and claims leading to an award by the Collector. In case of disagreement the person interested can make reference to the court.

### Stage IV

This is the final stage of the proceedings relating to the acquisition of land. At this stage the Collector takes possession of the land (Section 16) and compensation made to the affected parties (Section 31 to 34). Thus, the possession of land can be taken taking only after the Collector makes the award. With the Collector possession of the land, rights .to it are vested completely with fhe government, free of all encumbrances.

## Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984

The Act was drastically amended in 1984 by the Central Government. Among other things the Act set a time limit for the completion of all proceedings, from the intention notification for acquisition of land to the issue of (declaration of intended acquisition under Section 6. Under this section it is stipulated that no declaration shall be made after a period of three years for land covered under Section 4(1) in case of Land Acquisition (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, 1967 but before the commencement of Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1981. Also, no declaration shall be made after a period of one year for land covered under section 4(1) after the commencement of Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984.

The amended Act also sets the time limit of two years within which the Collector must make his award (Section 11 A). As regards compensation, the amended Act fixed a piice of 12 percent p.a. interest for the period commencing from the date of the intention notification and ending with the date of the Collector's award and also a payment of solatium at the rate of 30 percent of the market value of the acquired land (i.e. compensation for loss, because of suftering or injured feelings). The amended Act also provided for an opportunity to those who are\* dissatisfied with the Collector's award to apply to him for a re>determination of the compensation payable on the basis of an order for higher compensation froih the Reference Court. Though, the above mentioned changes by the amended Act may prove beneficial for the people for a more expedited compensation, the amendments have provisions which have made the State more powerful in terms of the discretionary powers that are now vested with the State under Section 17. Under the urgency clause for acquisition the State can dispense with Section 5^A under which the person interested can file objections to proposed acquisition.

# Land Acquisition Aniendment Bill, 1998

The recently proposed Land Acquisition Amendment Bill of 1998 further strengthens the Collector's position. Despite rome provisions such as bringing the R&R (Resettlement and Rehabilitation) on the statute book, a more transparent approach and curtailing the time period for officials to act faster, there are critical gaps which require serious consideration. The attempt here is not to go into details but to present the trends that would emerge with the existing laws being modified by the above mentioned Amendment Bill. It is stipulated that the proposals must be complete in all respects before it is brought

before the Collector. This will certainly prohibit the proposals, which are often rushed through mostly due to extraneous considerations. As regards the time limits, on the one hand the time between initial declaration and public purpose declaration has been reduced from three years to six months, on the other hand the time for filing objections to any intended acquisition process has been reduced to twenty one days. This will certainly pose hardships to the affected persons who are often illiterate and marginalised. The Collector's role has been made far more powerful in deciding cases including appeals on objections. Another example is Section-12, which has been freshly introduced, and it takes away the Court's power regarding compensation, making it over to the Collector. The reference and revision concerning appeals on acquisition can only be done in the High Court. It is well known that litigation costs one very high and it would almost be impossible for the common man to afford costs relating to legal intervention in High Courts. This certainly makes it more difficult for the common man to get a fair value for his land. Presently, it is under the 'market value', which does not take into account several benefits that are associated with ownership of land, thus making the compensation unjust.

Going by the current trends, the present amendments are far from being ideal. In the wake of liberalisation, acquisition of land is going to be easier for multinationals through Government Corporations and this will further marginalise the underprivileged.

#### **Public Purpose**

The issue of 'public purpose' is perhaps, the most contentious and probably the most debatable issue that has beset the Court as well as the intelligentsia. The following section will try as far as possible to develop a trend, if any, of the views of the court, that has emerged on the question of public purpose, public good and public interest as far as the Land Acquisition Act is concerned. Specifically, this study will try to list out the guidelines and the criteria that are used in arriving at a conclusion as to which purpose is of public interest or otherwise. There are various other Acts such as the Indian Forest Act, 1927, Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 under which the acquisition of land for the purposes of the Act is also deemed to be for 'public purpose'.
