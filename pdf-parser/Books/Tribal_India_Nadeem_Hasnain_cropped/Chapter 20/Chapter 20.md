THAT crime is hereditary no one would seriously believe, but that men are bom to crime is at least an Indian reality. Criminality cannot go by groups. It is an individual phenomenon. But with a single stroke the British authorities, through the enactment of Criminal Tribes Act in 1871, branded some whole castes and tribes criminals. "In fact, it may be said that a much lai^ger percentage of these tribes were led into criminality by giving them the stigma of criminal tribes" (A.V. Thakkar, 1949). as

THE tribes in India, known as "Criminal Tribes", regarded crime as their hereditary calling and had developed an elaborate code of discipline and formalities for this. They adopted crime as their trade and engaged in anti-social activities. "Criminal activities are largely emphasised by the cultural pattern of the tribe concerned. Certain criminal tribes have got their sanction for criminal activities in their religious beliefs and practices. The sanction is often derived from their tribal gods who are believed to revel in crime" (D.N. Majumdar, 1949).

DURING the British rule, these tribes were made to bear the brand of criminality by the accident of their birth and were subjected to restraints on their movements so harsh that even an accidental failure to report to their respective police stations at unearthly hours treated as an offence. Justifying the imposition of a savage sentence of imprisonment. was

AMONG such tribes wandering in northern and central India, important ones are the Bawaria, Bhatu, Beria, Bhedkut Biloch, Dorn, Habura, Hami, Kanjar, Karwal, Mina, Mahtam, Pakhiwara, Tagu and Sansia. The Yerkula, Yenadi and Sugali are some of the important tribal groups of southern India falling under this categoiy.

### Origin

LIKE many other castes and tribes, the origin of the so-called criminal tribes is also shrouded in mystery and very little is known about their ethnic composition. Majumdar opines that these wandering and vagrant tribes are not a homogeneous lot; ethnically they are mixed groups. They possess physical traits characteristic of the important

racial stocks in varied proportions. B. S. Bhai^gava (1949) is of the view that the criminal tribes have never cared to preserve their separate identity or purity like other more zealous castes and tribes of India. Their numbers have been swelled by recruits from all classes, consisting generally of adventurets, refugees, and outcastes, who are always welcome into their fold.

ACCORDING to one view they have descended from the Gypsies. Gypsy tribes are found all over the world and are believed to have emanated from a common origin. But there is little evidence to show that the criminal tribes of India belong to the same stock as the Gypsies found in the present day Europe or other parts of the world. Again, it is held by some that the criminal tribes owe their origin to the aborigines of the old, who had been displaced from time to time by the incursions of the inhabitants of Central Asia. According to this view, those aborigines who could not find suitable habitations had to roam from place to place. In due course of time wandering became way of life with them and they began to feel quite at home in the nomadic mode of life. Some of them found it convenient to supplement their honest earnings by petty thefts and pilferings. As Bhaigava (ibid) tell us, most of the Hindu criminal tribes of upper India trace their origin from Rana Pratap of Chittoigarh in Rajputana. By a legend they generally date their social degradation from the time of the siege of Chittoigarh by Allauddin Khilji in 1308 AD. They ascribe their nomadism chiefly to their efforts to save themselves and their religion from the inroad of Islam. a

THE existing evidence before us goes to prove that the nomadic tribes have always been recruiting their members from practically all sections of society, and naturally, therefore, the social origin of different criminal tribes differ in various particulars. Definite historical information about their past are meagre or unobtainable. However, Bhaigava has collected some legends which throw some light on their origin and antecedents.

SOME scholars have derived the word Bawaria from the Hindi word Baola or Baora meaning cra^. It is said that after the capture of Chittoigarh a number of Rajputs ran away into the jungle and began to live a nomadic life. One of them fell in love with a Rajput maid and married her. But he could not give up his nomadic mode of life although the parents of his wife strongly disapproved of it. They began to call him Baola meaning mad or crazy and later on his descendents came to be known as Bawaria. In the time of the

Marathas, they took to dacoity on a laige scale. A note on the 'Bhavri tribe published by the Madras police, derives the word Bhavri from Bavdi or Baoli meaning a pond. It is said that these people originally used to settle on the banks of a laige Baoli meaning a pond and hence the name Bawaria.

A GOOD number of Bhatus have recently come under the influence of Christianity and Islam. Some authorities are of the opinion that the n^e of the tribe has been derived from the Sanskrit word Bhanti, meting varieties. Nesfield is of the view that the word Bhatu is\* derived from the Hindi word Bahutor, meaning arm-breakers, referring to their favourite device used against their opponents. The Muslim Bhatu differ in their social life from other Bhatus only in this respect that they buiy their dead instead of cremating them, and contraiy to the Islamic faith they do not hesitate to eat pork.

KANJAR is a name usually applied to a number of nomadic tribes of Gypsy origin. Crooke derives it from the Sanskrit word Kamanchara-a wanderer in the woods. The Kanjar residing in the Punjab and Rajputana profess that they originally served the Jats and the Rajputs as bards. By and by their profession became less remunerative and perforce they had to supplement their income from other sources.

SIMLARLY other criminal tribes also carry some legends about their origin but it is veiy difficult to verily them due to paucity of historical material and conflicting and some time contradictory claims and counter claim.

## Habitat and Population

CRIMINAL tribes were concentrated in the present Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. They were not present in appreciable number in the States of Assam and Jammu and Kashmir in the North and Kerala in the South.

POPULATION statistics for denotified tribes are not available since they are not separately counted during the Census. The Criminal Tribes Act Enquiiy Committee estimated their population at about 35 lakhs. The Special Working group on Cooperation for Backward Classes estimated their number and distribution in different States to be 35.13 lakhs as below—

AT PRESENT, according to one estimate, they number about 560 lakhs. STATES are empowered to notify communities considered as 'Denotifled Tribes' in their respective State. The list of communities varies from State to State. Some of the communities listed as \* 'Denotifled Communities\* are also included in the list of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes in the respective States based on criteria followed for the purpose. The number of Denotifled Communities in different States is given below—

### Legi^tive Measures

THE Encyclopaedia of Social Work in India (Vol. Ill) giving a detailed chronological description tells us that the early years of the nineteenth centuiy witnessed unprecedented insecurity in northern India owing to the criminal activities of thugs and dacoits. It led the then Government of India to undertake special measures to suppress such oiganised criminal acts. Consequently, in 1839, a Thagi and Dacoity Department was created to handle this task. The special operations of the Department, conducted through specially appointed Superintendents for the purpose, brought to fore that certain tribes in Northern India, like the Meenas, were primarily responsible for oiganised crimes and offences against property. To keep a check over the activities of these tribes, the first Criminal Tribes Act was passed in 1871.

EARLIER, under Regulation XXII of 1793, Magistrates empowered with summaiy powers to punish specified tribes which were committing systematic crimes, vagrants and suspected persons. With the adoption of the Indian Penal Code in 1860 and the Criminal Procedure Code in 1861, however, the above summaiy powers were withdrawn. were

### The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871

IT WAS mandatory, according to this Act, before declaring a gang, a tribe or a class of persons as criminal, to report to the Governor General in Council giving adequate reasons for declaring it as such. It was also stipulated that satisfactory arrangements be made for settling those criminals who did not lead a settled life. The report was also to state the arrangements made for enabling the tribe to earn its living when it was settled in any fixed place of residence. There was, however, no provision in the Act to separate the children of criminal tribes from their parents, although its necessity was emphasised during the debate on the Bill in the Council. Although the provisions of this Act were helpful in controlling the criminal tribes who were settled, other predatory tribes could not be tackled in view of the stipulation that necessary arrangements should be made to the satisfaction of the government for settling them in some specified place.

THE Government of the North-Western Provinces appointed a Police Committee consequent on the serious crimes committed by the Sansi tribe coming to light while implementing the Act. On the basis of the recommendations of this Committee, the Government of India decided to amend the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871.

### The Criminal Tribes (Amendment) Act, 1897

INTER-ALIA, the amending Act provided for minimum penalty on second and third convictions of members of criminal tribes for specified officer. The local governments were also empowered tc separate children between the ages 4 and 18 from the criminal tribes and place them in specially established reformatory '.settlements'.

### The Criminal Tribes Act, 1911

THE Indian Police Commission appointed by the Government of India in 1902-03 brought to the notice of the Government some of the defects in the 1871 Act which stood in the way of its wider application. It recommended that a special clause be inserted in the Criminal Tribes Act to authorise simple registration of notified criminal gangs and the taking of the finger impressions of the adult male members. In view of the recommendations of the Indian Police Commission, a Bill, to replace the Act of 1871, was introduced in the Council. It was felt that the criminal tribes could not be clubbed together for the purposes of containing their criminal activities as they fell into three main categories, viz. those who were originally criminals but had settled down to honest occupations with the exception of a few members; those who had settled abodes but continued to do crimes; and those wandering tribes who committed crimes when opportunities arose.

UNDER the new Criminal Tribes Act, 1911, local governments were given wide powere to declare a tribe to be a criminal tribe without requiring its settlement or provision for means of living. The members of the tribe could be registered and their finger impressions taken for observation and supervision, after due notification. Even the more criminally minded members could be restricted to any specified area or interned in special settlements made for them. Under this act, the minimum age of children to be separated from their parents was raised to 6 years.

### The Criminal Tribes (Amendment) Act, 1923

THE Criminal Tribes Act was a Central Act but could be adopted by-local governments by framing suitable rules to suit local conditions. In its operation, however, local governments encountered number of problems. This led to the convening of a conference in 1919 to evaluate the experience gained by the operation of the Act. The Indian Jails Committee of 1919 was also asked, inter alia, to examine the functioning of the Criminal tribes Act, 1911. Based on the recommendations of the Indian Jails Committee and the said conference, the Criminal Tribes (Amendment) Act, 1923 was passed. The amended Act empowered local governments to settle tribes either in its own territory or in another province with its consent, prescribing an enquiry before any criminal tribe was interned in a settlement or transferred from the British Indian provinces to the Indian States. As regards the policy to be followed in the operation of the Act, the Government of India made it clear that the Provinces would not be interfered with but the administration of the Act should be carried out in such a way as to ensure effective prevention of crime, proper treatment of the tribes in the matter of wages, housing etc., and their reclamation.

### The Criminal Tribes Act, 1924

BY 1924, a number of Indian States had also enacted legislation to deal with the criminal tribes in accordance with the provisions of the legislation in the Provinces. Important amendments were also effected in the Criminal Tribes Act, particularly the Amendment Act, 1923. These developments prompted the consolidation of the entire legislation relating to criminal tribes and, accordingly the Criminal Tribes Act, 1924 was passed.

## The Criminal Tribes (Amendment) Act, 1947

AS A result of the implementation of various legal measure and the greater awareness among the members of the criminal tribes, they gradually got themselves educated and started settling down in lawful occupations. This attitudinal change among the criminal tribes received considerable sympathy from the government and the people at laige, particularly social workers and an atmosphere of goodwill was generated in respect of the need to dispense with some provisions of the Act. Accordingly, a private members\* Bill was admitted in 1946 which sought to amend section 23 of the Act providing for minimum

enhanced punishments for those convicted for a second or third offence. It was also felt that a whole tribe should not be dubbed as criminal. The Criminal Tribes (Amendment) Act 1947 was thus passed which abolished the minimum punishment prescribed for the second and third convictions.

### Criminal Tribes and Notified Tribes

THE Central Act of 1924 was also applicable to the Provinces with suitable modifications. Accordingly, the Governments of Madras and Bombay made certain amendments' to the application of the Act at different periods. The Criminal Tribes (Amendment) Act, 1943, of Madras was the first amending Act to liberalise the provisions of the Act, including naming the 'Criminal Tribes' as 'notified tribes'. Provisions were also made for relaxation of punishment, placing the accused in settlements and removal of children from parents to certified schools, etc. Some States opted to use the then Habitual Offenders Act in place of the Criminal Tribes Act.

### Repeal of Criminal Tribes Act

ATTAINMENT of independence brought in a favourable change in the outlook of governments vis-a-vis the deplorable conditions of the socalled criminal tribes arid it was felt that the provisions of the Criminal Tribes Act were inconsistent with the dignity of free India, As a first step, the Government of India, therefore, appointed in September 1949 a Criminal Tribes Act Enquiry Committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. Ananthasayanam Ayyangar to enquire into the working of the Act and to offer recommendations for its modification or repeat

ON THE basis of the recommendations of the Ayyangar Committee, which were of socio-legal in nature, the Criminal Tribes Act 1924 was abrogated in 1952 and replaced by the Habitual Offenders'Act which took cognizance of only those individuals who habitually indulged in crime. This brought about a fundamental change in the basic approach in as much as responsibility for crime was transferred from a whole community to the individual offenders.

WITH the abrogation of the Criminal Tribes Act the groups which previously notified under the Act came to be termed as Vimukta Jatis or ex-criminal tribes. The Backward Classes Commission appointed by the Government in 1953 also considered the question of the status of the ex-criminal tribes and their welfare needs. It recommended that such communities should neither be called 'criminal' nor 'ex-criminal' tribes thereby attaching any stigma to their were

name. It also suggested that they should simply be termed 'denotified communities'. Similar suggestions were also received from some social workers. As a result of these suggestions and with a view to removing the stigma of criminality attached to these tribes, they are now officially referred to as 'Denotified Tribes'. as

#### Cultural Environment and Initiation into Crime

POVERTY, of course, is the chief reason with all such resultant evils as low standard Of living, absence of anything approaching moral civic consciousness and sense of deprivation and marginal ity. Their mode of life which releases them from all such obligations as binding on the members of a settled human group is also a crucial reason for their criminality. These circumstances are enough to turn ordinary people with normal instincts into criminals. The perverted notion of crime that develops under these circumstances completes the vicious circle. Here crime is idealized and glorified. They actuated not only by the blind adherence to the traditional profession but also by the natural desire to supplement their meagre income by crime as a sort of subsidiaiy occupation. To these, we should add the joy of the wandering life, the call of the adventure, the dread of a humdrum and settled life which is so strong with all nomadic people. Standing beyond the pale of society, they rejoice in waging a remorseless war on it. or even are

THEY do not rest content by leading the life of crime for themselves. They consciously and deliberately subject their children to a strict and systematic course of education and training in crime. So long as a child is not sufficiently grown up to accompany them on 'active duty', the best possible theoretical training is imparted to him by the womenfolk and the menfolk alike. The moral background for the commission of crime is strengthened by the conviction instilled in them from their childhood that it is their birthright and sacred duty to earn their livelihood by committing anti-social acts even though by so doing they put society to great inconvenience and hardship. They take pride in committing crimes and in their society honour and respect for a person varies according to his success in his criminal career. A person having no taste for crime is looked down as a coward and he commands no respect.

THE Bawarias j^ify their crime by saying that they do not commit the so-called anti-social acts of their own accord. When they receive inspiration from the gods or the ancestral spirits, they have to comply. Bhai^ava (ibid) narrates that nearly every child is taught the art of hiding small things such as a gold rings or a few coins in his throat. The female children are taught to hide articles in certain pockets of their underwears, so that it is not easy to detect them: Some women able to hide article even in their vaginal cavity. are

IT IS evident from the narration given above that the initiation into crime commences at an early age and abetted by the cultural environment, expertise is obtained within a short time. Just to have a 'feel' of their lives, description of the criminal life as lived by two of the important tribes viz., the Kanjar and the Bawaria, is given here in some detail.

# Crime Among The KANJAR

AMONG the so-called ex-criminal tribes, the Kanjars occupy an important place in view of their numerical strength and vastness of their area of movement. Mostly they live in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, U.P. and parts of Maharashtra. They also visit places in Punjab and Andhra. Those in the south are known as Dakshmi Kanjars. They are also known by different names as Bijoria Nat, Kabutari Nut, Bhanmat and Banchchade in different parts of the countiy. The females among them used to go about begging and showing physical feats accompanied by their males who played on drum.

BASING their mode of life on thieving and pilfering, the Kanjars became hard and bold, sure of eye and swift in striking and getting away. J.C. Dikshit (1964) has provided a graphic and detailed account of the nature of crimes and modus operandi of the Kanjars wandering in Madhya Pradesh.

THE main types of offences committed by the Kanjars are: (i) dacoity, (ii) highway robbery, (iii) house-breaking, and (iv) thefts, including cattle thefts. In dacoities, the modus operandi is mostly uniform. Before starting for a raid they usually get complete information in about the topography of the village they propose to raid. Then they visit their priest and consult him regarding the most auspicious time for the commission of the crime. After offering the sacrifice of a fowl to the deity, they get heavily drunk and start for the excursion, armed with lathi, pharsa and firearms. Their women do not accompany the raiding party. The selection of the day is also important. It is usually two-three days after the full moon. They usually reach the village at dusk time, catch hold of an innocent villager and compel him to show the house they have to raid. On reaching the place they fire a few

shots in the air and throw stones along the street by means of slings. Thus, after scaring away the villagers they start looting. After committing the dacoity they soil the ground at the spot. They believe that by doing so, they will not be caught. After the mission has been completed, they leave for their abode. On the way they commit as many dacoities and robberies as they can. The time is so adjusted that they get the advantage of moonlight during their escape. On reaching their abodes they hand over the property to their womenfolk. After successful campaigns, there are usually big feasts and heavy drinking.

THE road dacoities and robberies are usually committed on market days at dusk time when persons returning from market are deprived of their cash and belongings. They usually start 'their campaigns after Dashehra festival when crops are standing in the fields providing them good hiding places.

DIKSHIT (ibid) tells us that they commit house-breaking by means of nakab, meaning making a whole in the wall. Some of them have also taken to gimlet, window bar wrenching and roof cutting. They slip their hands through the small opening left between door, windows, etc., and are also skilful in sliding of the locks and chains. They are also experts in removing ornaments from the persons of sleeping women and children.

THEY are veiy swift in their moments. After committing a series of offences in quick succession, they immediately move on. They are rapid travellers and when pressed cover as much as forty miles in one night. Their women play very important role in the disposal of stolen property. The property is usually buried in the jungles, away from their camp and only the women know the spot. According to their requirements the property is dug out and passed on to receivers in whom they have implicit faith. In case of arrest of male members the women en^ge lawyers and fight the cases. Each camp is headed by a women known as Patelan who directs their activities and looks after their interests when they are in jail or absconding.

THE Kanjars are so much hardened that even third degree methods have little effect on them. They do not easily break down after arrest. For this they are trained from early boyhood. The father would often beat a son mercilessly and keep him tied and without food for days, just to toughen and harden him.

## Crime Among The BAWARIA

IN THE past the Bawarias were notorious for committing daylight dacoities. They have now adopted less violent forms of crime and.

more shrewd methods which render their detection difficult. Though, they are mostly illiterate and are scattered all over India, they have kept intact distinctive language, customs and code words. And thus they are able to be in close communication with the entire tribe throughout the countiy.

B.S. BHARGAVA (1949) tells us that the Bawarias of northern India have been notorious for committing thefts from camps, specially of Government officials and are probably the most clever of camp robbers and tent cutters to be found in India. They are equally adept in naArafeaw—removing goods from a building by gaining entrance through a hole made in the wall. He narrates that they have an interesting custom connected with this. On reaching the house they plan to burgle, they throw three small stones one after the other to ascertain whether the inmates are fast asleep. While this is probably no more than a measure of precaution or safety, they say that in this way they decide their course of action. According to them, if a man gets up on this warning, it shows that he has earned money by hard and honest labour; if he continues to sleep, they conclude that he has acquired money by dishonest means. Hence, if one does not wake up, they consider themselves justified in robbing him and distributing his wealth among those who have a better claim to it. Sometimes they enter the camps of pilgrims in the guise of ascetics and steal ornaments and other valuables when the inmates are asleep.

BURGLARY is their speciality and they commit it only when they are sure of a large haul. Before preparing for an expedition omens sought by counting grains of boiled wheat. If the omens are favourable they set out on the expedition in guises best suited to their requirements. At the time of committing the offences they usually put on a mask to avoid chances of recognition. are

FOR breaking into the houses they make use of the two devices known as Bagli Naqab and Naqab. In the first device, a hole into which a hand can be inserted is made in the wall at the side of the door frame and at the level of the latch. The arm is entered through this hole and the door is unfastened from the inner side. The second device is resorted to when they are aware of the exact place at which a certain property is placed in a room and are sure that the property be removed from outside without personal entrance. They simply make a hole at the place in question and secure their booty through it. During a single night a gang of Bawarias can successfully commit a number of offences. Usually they do not can

indulge in criminal activities in partnership with anyone who does not belong to their tribe.

WHEN Bawaria camps are searched one invariably hears a peculiar sound produced from the throat which is considered as a warning to others to escape if possible. While going to a place one of them so drags his stick on the way that it leaves a track behind. Their accomplices easily follow the track so left and reach the rendezvous at the appointed time. This is especially helpful to the absconders. Where the road is metalled or the ground is such which cannot conveniently be marked, they make small piles of stones and leaves alternately every few furlongs to guide other accomplices.

ACCORDING to Bhargava (ibid), they use a regular and widespread system of signs when they are engaged in their criminal activities. Some of the signs used by them are :

|    | The curved arc points out the direction the gang has<br>chosen                                                       |
|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    | Three persons are hiding in the vicinity                                                                             |
| СШ | Four persons have gone in the direction of the arrow                                                                 |
|    | Two persons are hiding in the well                                                                                   |

### Reform and Rehabilitation

THE permanent solution of the problem of the so-called criminal tribes will depend upon continued improvement of their economic and social conditions, the education of their younger generation and also an effective supervision and check on their criminal activities. Due to some anomalies and overlapping, the task of refoim and rehabilitation has not been moving ahead smoothly. Now designated \_ "Denotified Communities", these criminal tribes appear to possess all the characteristics of tribals but not all have been included in the list of Scheduled Tribes. The Backward Classes Commission, set up under Article 340 of the Constitution had, in their report submitted in 1955, rightly recommended that these communities should be divided into Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other Backward Classes as the case may be. Nothing significant, however, appears to have been done to give effect to that recommendation. This has resulted in the anomaly on the same community being treated as a Scheduled Tribe in one region and as a "Denotified Community" in another in the same State.

THE Shilu Ao Committee Report (1969) regards the denial to such of the members of "Denotified Communities" as are in every way tribal benefits admissible to their Scheduled brethem, as invidious and contrary to the spirit of the Constitution.

THE absence of public sympathy is the greatest drawback in implementing any scheme of reform and rehabilitation of these tribes. Unfortunately, the abolition of the Criminal Tribes Act, instead of improving their status, gave them a free licence to commit more crimes. 'The repeal of the Act followed by abolition of all criminal settlements without any serious effort on the part of the Government to rehabilitate them, only vivified the old instinct of crime which they committed with redoubled vigour. It has been observed that during the last few years they systematically started their depredation with such vehemence that all the labour put in by the criminal tribes settlements appeared to have been a waste" (Dikshit, 1964). It was, therefore, decided to make a new approach to this problem. It was decided to pursuade them to settle down to peaceful ways of life, to make them realize the futility of the kind of life they were leading and to reform them economically, socially and culturally, so that they could live as good and responsible citizens.

### Welfare Measures for the Denotifled Communities

EARLY MEASURES—^Besides welfare measures introduced in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Tribes Act, welfare and reformative activities were also implemented, although to a limited extent, by various states. The 'settlement treatment' given to the^ criminal tribes made them amendable to discipline, and welfare activities carried out in the settlement and even outside the settlements improved their social and economic status to some extent.

UNDER the provisions of the Criminal Tribes Act, various State Govemments/Provinces established colonies meant for members of criminal tribes. Punjab had 9 such colonies, Rajasthan 17 and Bhopal 5, while Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Hyderabad and Delhi had one each. Besides, Uttar Pradesh had 4 settlements and Punjab, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh had one settlement each set up under Section 16 of the Act.

IN THESE colonies and settlements certain facilities for agriculture, cottage industries and other avocations were made available. In most of them, facilities for education were also made available both for children and adults. In some colonies there were facilities for vocational education, recreation and games. Some of the children were enrolled in Reformatory Schools in some States. While the colonies were under the surveillance of the police department, the settlements were managed directly by the government, but welfare measures were operated either by the government or through voluntary organisations.

IN SOME states like Bengal, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madras, Bombay, Delhi, Bihar and Orissa, reformative work was well organised and, therefore, there was perceptible change in the conditions of the settlers. In Bengal, for example, they were placed in industrial settlements. Punjab provided lands for cultivation, made available agricultural inputs and organised cooperative credit societies, besides provision for education of children and adult literacy classes. In Uttar Pradesh, there was provision for free education, facilities for higher education, organisation of 'reform panchayats' for eradication of evil habits, employment facilities in small scale industries, irrigated agriculture arid tailoring, and facilities for recreation and games in settlements. Special officers were also appointed to look after the welfare measures for the settlers and for reclamation colonies.

WELFARE schemes in Delhi included compulsory education for children, establishment of an adult education centre, cleanliness drive in the colony, establishment of a cooperative thrift and credit society and a cooperative store. Attempts were also made to find suitable occupations for the inmates. In Bihar too, lands were allotted for cultivation, besides organising a cooperative credit society.

IN MADRAS, higher elementary schools (separate for boys and girls in some settlements) were established with provision for free education, mid-day meals, books and clothing. In Bombay, attendance in day school was compulsory for all children, while night school attendance was compulsory for males in the settlements. The school children were provided with all facilities free of cost. More vulnerable children (orphans, children of irreclaimable parents, etc.) were separated and placed in children's home. Punjab too had facilities for reformatory schools where children of criminal tribes were sent. Besides the British Indian Provinces, some of the princely States also had provision in their Criminal Tribes Acts for welfare measure like colonisation, education, etc.

### Later Measures

THE problem of rehabilitating the '^enotified tribes' and weaning them away from criminal associations is a complex one. In addition to the criminal tendencies, they were educationally and economically back-ward, especially as they were communities with nomadic habits. After the abrogation of the Criminal Tribes Act, 1924, in 1952 the government was keen to undertake such schemes as would accelerate the process of integration of the denotified tribes into the mainstream of society. However, for want of preparation, only a small beginning could be made in the First Five Year Plan. An expenditure of Rs. 102 lakh was incurred on training towards a settled way of life for nomadic and semi-nomadic communities. One of the schemes implemented during the First Plan was opening of Ashram type schools to provide, besides free education, boarding and lodging arrangements for the children so as to keep them away from the bad influence of the older generations. Members of the denotified tribes were also entitled to get post-matric scholarship.

DURING the Second Five Year Plan period, welfare schemes for denotified tribes were undertaken partly under the Centrally sponsored programmes and partly under the state sector. A provision of Rs. 202 lakhs was made under the State sector and of Rs. 110 lakhs under Centrally sponsored programmes. During the Third Plan period, in view of the urgency of early rehabilitation of these tribes.

all the schemes were implemented under the Centrally sponsored programmes. Economic development and social progress of these communities were, therefore, given emphasis, for which Rs. 419 lakhs was made available. In the Fourth Plan period all these schemes were continued with an allocation of Rs. 439 lakhs.

THE pattern of implementation of schemes was again changed in the Fifth Plan period when all the welfare schemes for the denotified tribes were transferred to the State Plans Sector. Accordingly, the States were also advised to include the developmental programmes for these communitiesjnjhe-general sectors of their plans. Gujarat, Himachal PradeshrKarnataka, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal included programmes for these communities under the backward classes sector of the State plans with an outlay of about Rs. 600 lakhs.

IN THE Sixth Five Year Plan onwards these schemes continued. The programmes undertaken for the welfare of the denotified tribes can be grouped into three broad heads: educational, economic development and other schemes.

FROM the expenditure incurred on the welfare of denotified, nomadic and semi-nomadic communities during the Fifth Five Year Plan, it would appear that educational programmes got paramount importance, having utilised three-fourths of the total budgets. They included granting of scholarships and stipends to eligible students, grant of tuition and examination fees, provision of mid-day meals and establishment of Asharm schools, residential schools and hostels. For the economic development of these communities schemes like rehabilitation/colonisation , assistance for agriculture development, animal husbandly, poultiy farming, cottage industries and oiganisation of cooperative societies were undertaken. Other miscellaneous schemes included setting up of community welfare centres, Balwadis, Sanskar Kendras, digging of drinking water wells etc.

THE schemes implemented by different States have varied. The Government of Andhra Pradesh, for example, has provided housing facilities, scholarships and open schools and hostels, for which non-Plan provisions have been utilised. Very few educational and economic schemes have been taken up for these communities in Bihar outside old Champaran and Darbhanga districts where non-Plan provisions have been drawn upon. Schemes like financial assistance for small traders and cottage industries, assistance for development of agriculture, imparting of training to artisans, assistance for purchase of milch cattle, and educational programmes are among the

welfare schemes undertaken by the State of Gujarat. The denotified tribes of Haryana are being helped both in the field of education and economic development. They are being given land for agriculture and also for housing. Subsidies are also provided for the purchase of pigs, buffaloes, goats, etc. Recently the State Government has set up a committee to make an indepth study of the problems of the denotifi^ communities and to suggest measures for their socio-economic development. No specific scheme has been drawn up by the Himabhal Pradesh Government. The state Government, however, proposes to start a few schemes for the educational and economic development. For education. Ashram Schools and ordinary schools have been established by the Maharashtra Government. Development of agriculture, colonisation and digging of irrigation wells are some of the economic activities undertaken for them. To ensure employment, training facilities are provided, and subsidy for procuring milch cattle is granted by the State Government. Among the economic activities undertaken by the Government of Orissa are establishment of rehabilitation colonies, allotment of agricultural land, assistance for agriculture, irrigation facilities, assistance for goat rearing, piggery and setting up of small scale industries. The State Government of Rajasthan undertakes both education and economic programmes for the denotified tribes. Important among the educational programmes are award of scholarship to pre-matric students, and incentives to students at the elementary stage. Economic schemes include housing grants and training in crafts. In the field of education, Uttar Pradesh provides pre-matric and post-matric scholarships and assistance for technical education. Agricultural development and encouragement of cottage industries are also undertaking for the economic upliftment of these communities. Rehabilitation programmes are implemented by providing houses and agricultural land.

AS ALREADY stated the absence of public sympathy is the greatest hindrance in their rehabilitation. It is seen that the villagers, in the vicinity of their settlements, are still suspicious of them and do not take to them kindly. They still refuse to give them employment. Confidence in them has to be established. It is possible that tendencies to relapse into occasional criminal activities may still persist even among the reformed and settled groups, and there may be occasional lapses on their part. But they will have to be dealt with patience, sympathy and compassion and efforts to reform them shall have to be continued with missionary zeal.

FURTHERMORE, these unfortunate people, as a result of their past experiences, also view with suspicion efforts on the part of any

outsider to approach them and help them in settling in gainful occupations. According to M. K. Venkatesan (1964), a study of Denotified Tribes in various centres has shown that they are not interested in settling on occupations which will yield some return over a period of years and require steady application or efforts. They are more interested in trades or occupations which all give them a quick return and that too of comparatively higher amounts than that received by ordinary unskilled labourers. A study of the Denotified Communities in Baroda revealed that they are quite adept in various trades, such as diamond cutting, selling of brass and stainless steel utensils in exchange of old clothes, carpentry, blacksmity, retail selling of vegetables, pulling rickshaws or carrying head-loads for hire. They interested only in having some sizable earning every day. are

THEY are very chary of taking new ideas, as their experience so far has only been of maltreatment at the hands of the police. They have reached tlie stage when they cannot believe that government or any other agency is interested in their well-being. In overcoming this psychological resistance, the planners and administrators dealing with their rehabilitation should constantly keep in mind that they are dealing with an intelligent and enterprising set of people who could be provided with such schemes as interest them.
