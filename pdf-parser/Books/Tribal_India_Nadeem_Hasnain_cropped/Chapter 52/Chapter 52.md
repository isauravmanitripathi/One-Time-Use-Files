# The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006

## Background

FOR many tribal people and other forest communities, forests the source of livelihood, identitj^ Customs and traditions. The forest dwelling scheduled tribes and other traditional forest dwellers inhabiting forests for generations were in occupation of the forest land for centuries. However, their rights on their ancestral lands and their habitats had not been adequately recognized despite them being integral to the very survival and sustainability of the forest eco-system. The traditional rights and interests of forest dwelling scheduled tribes and other traditional forest dwellers on forest lands were left unrecognized and unrecorded through faulty reservation process during consolidation of State forests, in the past. are

THE forest dwelling tribal people and the forests are inseparable, a factor that also ensures conservation of ecological stemming from the very ethos of tribal life. The conservation processes for creating wildemsss and forest areas for production forestry somehow ignored the bonafide interests of the tribal community from the point of view of legislative framework in the regions where tribal communities primarily inhabited. The simplicity of tribes and their general ignorance of modern regulatory frameworks precluded them from asserting their genuine claims to resources in areas where they belonged and depended upon. The modem conservation approaches also advocated exclusion rather than integration. It was much later that forest management regimes initiated action to recognize the occupation and other rights of the forest dwellers and integrated them in designs of management. Insecurity of tenure and fear of eviction from the lands where they had lived and thrived for generations were perhaps the biggest resources

reasons why tribal communities felt emotionally as well as physically alienated from forests and forest lands. This historical injustice needed correction and, therefore, the Government enacted the Scheduled Tribes and Other traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, which is commonly known as Forest Rights Act (FRA). The Act came into operation with the notification of Rules 01-01-2008 for carding out the provisions of the Act. on

The Act also goes beyond the "recognition" of forests rights and also empowers the forest rights holders. Gram Sabhas and local level institutions with the right to protect, re-generate, conserve and manage any community forest resource. This marks a decisive step forward in resource governance itself. Hailed rightly as a milestone in the history of tribal peoples' and forest dwellers' movements, the Act endeavors to facilitate their political empowerment to govern the forests for sustainable use and conservation. Precisely for these reasons, it becomes important to take firm proactive steps to make the necessary paradigm shift, particularly by the State Governments.
