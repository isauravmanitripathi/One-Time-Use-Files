# DEBT BONDAGE AND **BONDED TRIBES**

Chapter 17

![](_page_0_Picture_1.jpeg)

CHRONIC indebtedness among tribals is a universal phenomenon. Indian tnbals too seems to accept indebtedness as an inevitable and inescapable aspect of their existence but debt bondage as an economic arrangement is found only in some of the tribes. "Debt bondage is a system whereby a debtor pledges his labour or the labour of somebody else close to him in lieu of the interest to be paid on the loan advanced to him by the creditor. Usually the pledgee or his nominee is released only on the dischaige of the debt. Since the man gets only food and veiy little or no money, he has to depend upon someone else m the family to procure the sum required for his release ^d this, of course, is rarely available. The relationship may therefore last for months and even generations, frequently involving the male heir." (Saxena, 1978)

DEBT bondage is an outcome of the situation in which the tribals are becoming or have become part of peasantiy. The reasons of this state of affairs may be enumerated as follows:

- (i) uneconomic holdings;
- (ii) poor soil;
- OH) primitive techniques of cultivation;
- Oy) lack of irrigation facilities:
- (v) lackof creditfacilities for so called 'unproductive, purposes'
- (vi) lack of alternative economic avenues in their immediate vicinity:
- Mi) premie of strong cultural v.tiues of 'honesty and trutlfiilness which do not allow them to disown any debts howsoever old.

TOE roots of all these reasons may be found in the transformation of economy to wholly or partially a cash economy. Saxena further states that certain social institutions of tribal sociefy also contribute towards pushing the tribals into debt bondage. The ceremonies connect^ with the tribals' life cycle involve sacrifices, feasts, and gitts. When tribal economy was barter based and slightly more prosperous, these ceremonies did not attain much financial strain With increasing contacts with other cultures, and change over to money-based economy, the expenditure on such ceremonies has been

fast increasing. This situation provides an unlimited scope to the exploitative operations of money-lenders and traders. Their dealings with ignorant and simple tribals are such that the debt once incurred becomes veiy difficult to be cleared and telescope infinitely into the future. The tribal people do not know any other agency which can help them so readily and even at off hours. Being illiterates, they can never scrutinise the accounts.

THE annual report of the Commissioner for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes indicates that the areas where the debt bondage is prevalent are scattered almost throughout the country.

THIS type of debt bondage is known by different names in different areas.

# The Kolta: Bonded for ever

THE Kolta are one of the worst examples of bonded labour among the Indian tribes: They inhabit Jounsar bawar, Rawain and Jounpur area of districts of Dehradun, Uttar Kashi, and Tehri Garhwal respectively—a more or less compact region of now Uttarakhand. The economic system of this region is technologically primitive and cultivation of land is a tradition and a way of life for the people of this region. In the local caste hierarchy, the Kolta occupies the lowest place, being untouchable with artisan groups occupying the middle rung and brahmins and rajputs standing at the apex by virtue of their being higher caste landlords. The traditional local code, i.e Dasturul amal prohibits the Kolta from owning land but its abolition by the state government has helped the Kolta to a considerable extent in acquiring the cultivating land as owner-cultivator.

OF ALL the handicaps the Kolta suffer from, the institutions related to land ownership and tenure provide the foundation for their "institutionalised" exploitations. Though as a result of governmental efforts a large number of Kolta have got some land but these holdings are so small, so meagre and usually of such low quality that they are uneconomic and insufficient to provide their owners with two square meals a day throughout the year.

FOR the Kolta the implication of having little or no land is that almost all households remain impoverished. They are unable to generate any surplus from their agricultural activity. Their bare minimum consumption expenditure exceeds their income. They have to depend on others to sustain themselves and have to borrow money from Brahmins-Rajput landlords at usurious rates of interest varying from 25-60% per annum with another 64% deducted from the loan as initial commission for "Ganth khulai", literally meaning opening the not of cloth in which the moneylender traditionally keeps his money. Even those who succeed in obtaining loans from co-operative societies for agricultural purposes usually do not spend the entire money for the specific purpose and a large part of it is consumed for 'unproductive' purposes, like marriage, treatment of sickness, consumption expenditure at festivals, etc.

ALWAYS ready to exploit and keen to engage the labour of his debtor, the landlord moneylender agrees to advance the loan on the well known conditions. Since most of the Kolta are illiterate, they have no idea of what is being entered in the account books of the moneylender. They put their thumb impression very submissively and that seals their fate. In many cases these transactions are oral, and they cannot afford to approach a court of law for seeking redress.

But even those transactions which are recorded in the account books are nothing but legal fiction. Wrong entries and inflated amount are quite common and the most a Kolta can do is to call the village panchayat (which is dominated by the Rajputs). The panchayat instead of helping him usually finds some pretext to fine him for trying to "backout\* of the loan maligning his 'savior' landlord moneylender. The debtor the poor Kolta in these circumstances, has no choice but to pledge his services as bonded labour. He is not even in a position to pay the interest not to speak of the principal amount. And therefore, his bondedness may, as it often does, continue for generations. He has to suffer great privations and work for his master from dawn to dusk under conditions of semi-starvation.

THE first and only comprehensive study of the bondage of Kolta carried out by present author, (Hasnain, 1982) shows that their chronic indebtedness and the resultant bondedness lead to the following consequences:

- (i) loss of personal freedom and utilization of their labour almost free of cost;
- (ii) change in occupation and loss of money;
- (Hi) land alienation and its acquisition by the creditor
- (iv) conversion of their wives, sisters, and daughters into posititutes sold and resold in near and distant cities for ending the debt bondage: and
- (v) chronic veneral diseases. Proprietor

THUS, we see that the process of bondedness which begins as an economic transaction under the cultural and the ecological conditions, results in servitude for not only the borrower but his generations to come.

## Re-visit after 25 Years

THE fieldwork for this study was done between 1973 to early 1976. By that time the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976 was not promulgated. This piece of legislation did make some difference in the lives of bonded labour in different parts of the country in various ways and degrees.

LET us first take a look at this Act before making commenst on the changes coming into the lives of the Kolta bonded labour - the population under study representing one of the worst cases of bonded labour in the countiy\*.

### 316\_TRIBAL INDIA

INDIA ratified ILO convention No.29 (forced Labour Convention 1930) on 30.11.1954. Tragically, it took almost 22 years for the Government of India to pass a legislation called Bonded Labour (Abolition) Act 1976. Yet, India is the first country in South Asia to enact such a legislation. In pursuance of this, some institutional mechanisms were developed in the form of vigilance committees at the district and sub-divisional levels under the chairmanship of District and Sub-Divisional Magistrates. Executive Magistrates were empowered under the Act to conduct summary trial of offences, to release the bonded labourers and to issue release certificates. The Act also lays down stringent penal provisions against the offending employers. The penalties include imprisonment for a term which may extend upto three years and also with fine which may extend upto Rs. 2,000/-. In order to assist the State Governments in their task of rehabilitation of released bonded labour, the Ministry of Labour has launched a centrally sponsored scheme since May 1978 for rehabilitation of freed bonded labour, under the scheme, the Government of India extends rehabilitation assistance at the rate of Rs. 10,000/- per freed bonded labour. The Supreme Court in its order, dated 11.11.1997 requested the National Human Rights Commissions to be involved in dealing with the issues of bonded labour. In pursuance of this order of the Supreme Court, a Central Action Group was constituted in the National Human Rights Commissions. The CAG held regular meetings/sensitization workshops at various places in collaboration with the Ministry of Labour and Employment and the matter is being pursued with the State Governments.

THE Bonded labour System (Abolition) Act defines bonded labour as 'the system of forced, or partly forced labour under which a debtor enters, or has, or is presumed to have, entered, into an agreement with the creditor to the effect that:

- (i) in consideration of an advancer obtained by him or by any of his lineal ascendants or descendants (whether or not such advance is evidenced by am documents) and in consideration of the interest, if any, due on such advance, or
- (ii) in pursuance of any customary or social obligation, or
- (iii) in pursuance of an obligation devolving on him by succession, or
- (iv) for any economic consideration received by him or any of his lineal ascendants or descendants, or
- (v) by reason of his birth in any particular caste or community, he would-

1. render by himself or through any member of his family, or any person dependent on him, labour or service, to the creditor, or for the benefit of the creditor, for a specified period or for an unspecified period, either without wages or for nominal wa^s, or

\

- 2. forfeit the freedom of employment or other means of livelihood force specified period or for an unspecified period, or
- 3. forfeit the right to move freely, throughout the territory of India, or
- 4. forfeit the right to appropriate or sell at market value any of his property or product of his labour or the labour of a member of his family or a person dependent on him, and includes the system of forced, or partly forced labour under which a surety for a debtor has, or is presumed to have, entered, into an agreement with the creditor lo the effect that in the event of the failure of the debtor to repay the debt, he would render the bonded labour on behalf of the debtor.

THIS Act locales Indian slaver as forced labour in adverse debtorcreditor relationships in employment, but primarily in intergenerational customary bondage in agriculture and its effect, in terms of the forfeiture of confatutional and legal rights of the person

CENTRE for Education and Communication in its report. "Labour Vulnerabilities and Debt. Bondage in Contemporary India (2005) has demystified bonded labour as identified in Bonded labour System (Abolition) Act. 1976 as:

- \* Bonded labour as agrestic and inter-generational customary bondage with emphasis on semi-feudal characters of social and economic relationships no longer adequate to comprehend and address contemporaiy phenomenon.
- \* Bonded labour is flexible and adaptive.

BONDED labour is ingrained in employer-employee relationship. It institutionalises and operationalises labour vulnerability which is done through the medium of debt. Bonded labourers invariable enter into a contract-forced or of own will. Contracts are one sided, opaque to the workers, to be observed in contravention of law and always as an instrument of control and exploitation of workers.

BONDED labour in India is rooted in histoiy- customary forced labour extracted from the members of the m^inalized and socially discriminated groups such as Dalits and Adivasis exploited by the caste landlords in the feudal society. The practice not only continued

#### 318 TRIBAL INDIA

after independence but multiplied as a result of increased poverty, reinforcement of social/caste discrimination and displacement of the poor, mainly tribal communities, from the laud and forest based livelihood by the very process of 'development'.

THE passing of the 1976 legislation straight away meant that those bound by an outstanding debt no longer needed to keep working with the creditor. It made the binding of labour against a debt a legal offence. It also made it legally binding on the Stale

GOVERNMENTS to identify all the bonded labourers in their suites, organise release from the wily employers and provide them with a viable rehabilitation package. To accomplish this, the State governments intiated several measures and instituted new administrative setups. Official surveys enumerated the incidents of bonded labour and special commissions were set up to formulate strategies for the eradication of the system. "The opening up of labour markets, the increasing linkages with towns and the growing political conciousness have made it difficult for employers to bind labour for generations. In some instances, employers, in order to circumvent the law have found other ways of subjugating labour" (S.S. Jodhka. ibid). The decline of the old system, however, did not translate into an) kind of substantive empowerment of the labour class. In some cases, it just meant a greater degree of eausalisatioin, or simply, unemployment. Freedom without economic security means little and brings other forms of vulnerabilities. We need to make a concerted effort to understand and conceptualise the newer, and increasingly elusive forms of bondage relations.

THE debt bondage may also be seen as a legacy of colonial of British and Capitalist legal concepts. "Such bondage", far from being a relic of pre-modern times, was constructed by the colonial discourse of freedom, namely a past enlightenment emphasis upon equality in nature, and the extension of money as a basis of social relations" (Peter Robb. 1994).

THE situation of Kolta of Jounsar bawar (Dehradun). Jounpur (Tehri Garhwal) and Rawain (Uttar Kashi), if analysed with reference to the "dominant caste" theory if M N Srinivas (1955), provides us a new insight different from the situations in other parts of rural India. In Jounsar bawar, the Kolta are a part of Jounsari tribe (a scheduled tribe) while in the remaining two geographically contagious regions they are scheduled caste. The common cultural indicators are their

untouchable status and polyandry- the entire region being a traditionally polyandrous tract. Jounsar bawar presents, a complex situation where people live along a caste hierarchy- Brahmins and Rajputs (popularly known as Khasa) occupying the highest rung in the caste hierarchy while Bajgi, Lohar and other occupational groups are placed at the middle rung while the Kolta, etc. being untouchables have been placed at the lowest rung- yet declared as a scheduled tribe. In the other two regions they are simply a caste group- an untouchable caste. Though, it is true that even in Jounsar bawar they are simply a caste group in the local caste hierarchy, they have been declared a scheduled tribe under Article 342 of the Constitution- a sociological reality super imposed by an administrative-constitutional arrangement. Thus, it would be theoretically pragmatic if we analyse the situation of domination of Rajputs even in Jaunsar Bawar under the conceptual umbrella of dominant caste. The social situation under study may be analysed, for example, within the framework of social, economic and political connections between Jats and scheduled castes in Haiyana. Rajasthan and Western Uttar Pradesh or Thakurs and Scheduled Castes in Eastern Uttar Pradesh. In this way an analysis of domination and resistance may also be done.

RAJPUTS in this region possess over 90% of the agricultural land and here comes the requirement of the use of agrestic serfdom. Here, the dominance of the Rajputs/Brahmins is perpetuated and legitimized through religion. As principal landowners, the dominant Rajputs achieved a privileged position within the local system of exchange of goods and services between castes on the lines of loosely traditional Hindu Jajmani System.

THE last thirty years witnessed some changes in the life of Koltas especially since 1980s - after the promulgation of the abolition Act. These changes are more visible in the villages located on the periphery of the roads. With the construction of more roads and pathways new markets have emerged increasing employment avenu^ and new avenues of livelihood. Wages have also increased. There is now in several villages in Jaunsar area. Not only new schools have been opened hut the rate of enrollment in schools has increased appreciably. Yet, the rate of dropouts among the Kolta children has not dropped appreciably. This is largely due to economic vulnerability of the Kolta. It is a universal phenomenon that wherever children increased movement and migration towards Himachal Pradesh

## 320 TRIBAL INDIA

contribute to family economy, they are not sent to schools. Why would the poor people deprive themselves from the earning or contribution of their children? No matter free education has been enforced yet the incentive to send the children to school is still very weak. True, the aspirational level of the Kolta has moved a little upward yet the means to achieve the goals have not increased proportionately. Thirty years ago the author hardly found a Kolta aspiring beyond a bus conductor or office peon or lowest level revenue official. Nor you come across dozens who want to become a government officer. This is definitely a good omen.

PARTICIPATION of the Kolta in the political process also shows substantial increase. In atleast five villages the author visited after 30 years the Kolta are no more deaf and dumb driven cattle. They demonstrate an increased will to participate and assert themselves not only in village or Khat panchayats but also in elections to the Slate Assembly. During my last visit a Kolta from village Navy dared to contest election in panchayat in the face of stiff opposition, ridicule and threat. Though he lost but blazed a trail for others to follow. This trend is more visible especially in Tehri Garhwal where the local Communist Party worked among them, mobilized and galvanised them to resist all such pressures from the Rajput land lords. I still vividly remember the days dining 1973-76 when during my Ph.D. fieldwork it was almost impossible to talk freely with the Koltas. Hence, most of my interviews had to be conducted during nights. In some of these villages the Rajputs were so aggressively hostile to any 'outsider' talking and mixing with bonded Kolta that it was almost impossible to conduct fieldwork. There were all sorts of harassment and intimidation to demoralize any outsider. This situation does not prevail in most of the villages anymore, though the landlords are still apprehensive and curious to know about any such interactions, the increasing self confidence and assertiveness of the Koltas prove to be a deterrent for them.

ONE aspect of life that has not changed much is the continuing prostitution and trafficking of women among the Kolta and Bajgi. Because of economic vulnerability it continues unabated. The pimps and brothel keepers of Delhi. Meerut and other cities are still active and taking advantage of their poverty they continue to tempt them to send their women folk to the brothels for earning some money. Such women stay at the brothels for periods ranging between 3-10 years and bring back with them sexually transmitted diseases and at the same time serving as catalytic agents for other vulnerable women from their group. Thus, both types of factors- "pushed out" factor

as well as "pulled into" factor may be seen working to the detrement of the Koltas and Bajgis. One is really lucky if one is not a Kolta/ Bajgi woman of Jounsar bawar and Garhwal.

BECAUSE of a flurry of interventions by the civil society organizations supported by judicial activism the stranglehold of drudgery and helplessness has loosened a lot yet the lack of political will on the pan of the government is not able to galvanise the administrative set up to effective action. The initial euphoria and enthusiasm of the NGOs has also abated in the lace of the sluggish and halfhearted efforts of the bureaucracy. Landlessness of the Koltas is still rampant while land based livelihood as long term rehabilitation measure is crucial for effective rehabilitation of the freed bonded Koltas. Moreover, creation of a strong alternative credit agency and innovative measurers such as \*self help groups' is imperative for the over all empowerment of the Koltas. It is also necessaiy to make release and rehabilitation sustainable. This is crucial in the face of 'freed' bonded Kolta going back to bondage and agrestic serfdom in a different form.

INTER-generational bondage is no longer a typical characteristic of bonded labour. In the lace of globalization, bonded labour may exist as pan of community production for the Indian or global markets, whether the product is brick and stone, garments of embroidered cloth such as zardozL Same is the case with Kolta. Wages for them are not sufficient to satisfy their needs, or be sufficient to repay the amount that they owe the employers. Thus, their economic vulnerabilities and the desired empowerment remain the most crucial factors reshaping their lives.

## Remedial Measures

SOME of the states have recently enacted laws providing severe punishment against such anti-social and inhuman practices and also including long-range preventive measures to stop accumulation of old debts. A central law with the following important provisions was also promulgated:

- (i) bonded labour system has been abolished and such labourers stand heed:
- (it) punishments provided for its contravention are substantial;
- (Hi) civil courts have no jurisdiction to pronounce upon or issue injunction in any matter connected with this law;

### 322\_TRIBAL INDIA

#### (iv) vigilance commillees at district and sub-divisional levels to be set up to advise the implementing authority. are

BUT inactment of laws is no solution. The bureaucratic apathy and lack of political will on the part of the government can never translate decisions and laws into action. Absence of vigorous and meaningful schemes of rehabilitation and their honest implementation, has converted these laws into damp squibs. Many of those who were bonded are still bonded and probably they will remain so until some radical steps are taken to their betterment.
