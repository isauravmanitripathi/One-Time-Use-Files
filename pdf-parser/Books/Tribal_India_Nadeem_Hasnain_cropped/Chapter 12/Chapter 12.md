FOR thousands of years primitive tribes persisted in forests arid, hills without having more than casual contacts with the populations of the open plains and the centres of civilization. "Now and then, a militaiy campaign extending for a short spell into the vastness of tribal country would bring the inhabitants temporarily to the notice of princes and chroniclers, but for long periods there was frictionless co-existence between the tribal folks and Hindu caste society in the truest sense of the word" (Haimendorf, 1960). But the physical isolation of most of the aboriginal tribes drew to an end when the modem means of communication like railways and roads were introduced in the nineteenth and early twentieth century coupled with the sudden growth of India's population. This caused land-hungry peasants of the plains to invade the sparsely populated tribal regions of middle and south India. Moreover the extension of law and order to areas which In earlier days had been virtually unadministered, enabled traders, money landers and a host of administrators, social workers, etc. to establish themselves in their villages.

THE onslaught of moneylenders and traders from the plains played havoc with the tribals who, as many examples show, lost their economic independence and lot of land within a span of twenty to thirty years of their contact with the cunning and professional people of the plains. The plight of the poor and vulnerable Indian tribals has been surfacing from time to time for about hundred years or so. But after independence they have been considered a 'problem' for government and their more advanced fellow citizens. The administrators, anthropologists, Christian missionaries and social workers have viewed this 'problem' from different angles with different perspectives. For the matter of convenience these views and approaches may be divided into three categories. The discussion that follows this categorization rotates round the three views:

- 0) No change Isolaiionism
- (ii) Assimilationism
- (Hi) Integrationism

MANY of the so-called aboriginal peoples or tribals have been pronounced by all those who came into close contact with them as rather simple, truthfully honest, usually jovial, colourful and happygo-lucky. They had their own peculiar social oiganization and some of had retained it till their contact with the British. "Even after the British contact, which rendered their contact with the Hindus more rapid and intensive, some of them retained it, especially those who have been governed through their old tribal organization. In the case of others, whether Hinduised or not, the oiganization itself has not completely disappeared, but has been lacking in that vitality and vigour which are characteristic of true tribal iife\*' (Ghurye, 1963). Let us take a brief view of their social and (economic organization and then the resultant problems:

- (1) Most of these tribes have been practising a crude type of cultivation called 'shifting cultivation' known by respective vernacular names. It required little labour, care and vital inputs. Under this scheme of cultivation trees and shrubs are felled with axe before the start of monsoon, fired and allowed to burn down into ashes. Now the desired seed is thrown and the nature is left to take care of the yield. To supplement their dietary requirement they collect all kinds of edible roots and fruits and hunt their favourable animals.
- (2) Further, most of the tribal people are habituated to drink, formerly to their home brewd liquor of rice, mahua-flower and other varieties and later to all kind of distilled liquor. As a group, Jounsari, Bhil, Gond and numerous other tribes drink and even their children drink liberally. This is due to their local environmental and ecological conditions. Liquor has also been a part of their ritual and religious practices.
- (3) Contacts with Christian missionaries especially in Bihar and north-eastern region played havoc with their spiritual world. The faith in their old gods was shaken and everything tribal was called blasphemous.
- (4) Different tribes have different customs in regard to marriage and inheritance. The tribal customs were not properly understood and they were punished by the regular courts. It hurt the tribal sentiments.
- (5) Tribal people have been, naturally, illiterate. When various schemes were taken up for their educational upliftment, very little care was taken to impart primaiy education in their respective mother-tongues even in case of informal education.

## 210\_TRIBAL INDIA

COMMENTING on the "life and death struggle of many primitive tribes in India and elsewhere in consequence of adverse economic conditions," D.N. Majumdar (1938) enumerated eleven causes : (1) The excise laws have hit them hard. (2) The displacement of tribal officers by those of the administration has disoiganized tribal life In all aspects. (3) Tribal land used for shifting cultivation has been taken away from them. (4) Quarrying in the land owned is not allowed except with the payment of heavy licence fee. (5) Shifting cultivation is prohibited in most areas. The people, thus, have been forced to take to the kind of agriculture unsuited to them or for which they do not know adequate offering and sacrifices which will "please the gods presiding over agriculture". (6) "Marriage by capture' has been treated as an offence under the Indian Penal Code. It was generally resorted to in order to avoid payment of heavy bride wealth, and the substitute has worked smoothly. The recognition of this custom as offence punishable by law will seriously undermine social solidarity and lead to racial disharmony. Already we know that late marriage is customaiy among the tribal people and there are a large number of men and women in every tribe who cannot afford to marry under normal conditions (7) The fairs and weekly markets which have begun to attract these people are ruining them financially. (8) Education which has been and is being imparted has been more harmful than otherwise. (9) The judicial officers, not been able to give them satisfactory Justice. (10) Missionary effort has resulted in creating in their minds a loathing for their own culture and a longing for things which they have no means to obtain. (11) Contact has introduced diseases in tribal peoples for which they possess no efficient indigenous pharmacopoeia. Medical health rendered by the state is meagre.

A.V. THAKKAR, popularly known as Thakkar Bapa", one of the most vociferous champions of tribal cause has analysed the situation in the straight manner of a social worker. According to him the "problems of the aborigins may be analysed into (1) poverty; (2) illiteracy; (3) illhealth; (4) inaccessibility of the areas inhabited by tribals; (5) defects in administration; and (6) lack of leadership.

A'H'ER viewing afr anthropologist's and a social worker's reactions, let us take up Hutton's view, a defender of British policy of tribal affairs. According to Hutton, most cruel tribal customs were put down and warfare was stopped. Modem medicine was applied and infant mortality curtailed. The arts of reading and writing were introduced and easier intercourse and communication placed at their disposal through roads and post offices. However, "the ills to which

primitives were exposed to came from two slightly different aspects of British rule.

- (1) Introduction of an administrative system which failed to take into account any special needs.
- (2) Deliberate measures intended to ameliorate the condition of these tribes.

THREE major evils proceeded from these sources: (1) loss of land and supplanting of the tribal village headman by foreigners, particularly by the Hindus from the plains, whether cultivators, moneylenders, traders, or mere land grabbers; (b) loss of means of subsistence and other evils; (c) disintegration of tribal solidarity."

AFTER analysing the plight of the tribal people let us go back to the three major approaches to the tribal problems to assess the impact of these approaches.

PROTAGONISTS of the first approach hold the view that all the alien links, responsible for the unregulated and unrestricted contacts with the modem world and the resultant miserable condition of the tribes, should be snapped and the primitive people should be allowed and encouraged to flourish in their own primitive environment.

THIS approach also includes what is now widely known as 'National Park Theory\* credited to Verrier Elwin. He suggested that "the first necessity is the establishment of National Park, in which not only the Baiga but thousands of simple Gonds in their neighbourhood might take refuge. A feirly large area was to be marked out for this purpose. The areas should be under the direct control of a tribe's commissioner who should be an expert standing between them as was resorted to in the case of the Hos and Santhals. viz., through the leaders or headmen of the tribe. The usual other steps like licensing all non-aboriginals, were to be taken to safeguard the aboriginals from being exploited by unscmpulous adventurers. In short, the administration was to be "so adjusted as to allow the tribesmen to live their lives with utmost possible happiness and freedom. No missionaries of any religion were to be allowed to breakup tribal life". This approach has been severely criticised on the ground that in the name of protecting the culture of the tribals, they cannot be kept aloof from the rest of India. They are not domestic cattle or zoo exhibits but equal citizens of free India and thus they should be allowed to contribute towards the advancement of their country and enjoy the resultant fruits of development.

## 212\_TRIBAL INDIA

THE second approach viz., assimilation has got considerable acceptance when lobbied by social workers. The protagonists of assimilation\* advance the view that tribes should be assimilated with their neighbouring non-tribal cultures. The policy of total assimilation has also not been in conformity with the trend of Indian history. Despite thousands of years of cultural contacts and intercultural exchanges, the Indian society could not become totally homogeneous. Though some cultural characteristics did take shape that are trully 'national' in character as the by-product of historical development of Indian society, this can not be denied that Indian society has been formed with Santhal, Gond, Oriya, Telegu, Kashmiri and numerous other cultural currents. Under such conditions the policy of total assimilation of tribal culture as the solution of their problems in unfair and futile. Even, the thought of forced assimilation or putting of as fate accompali smacks of'cultural authoritarianism'.

JAWAHAR LAL NEHRU has been very outspoken in condemning the imposition of the Hindu way of living on tribal populations reared in another tradition. Due to his deep sympathy for the tribal people and keen appreciation of their problems, the approach of the state towards the tribal people is based on the theme of'integration'.

THE approach of integration' of the tribal population with the rest of the Indian population on the basis of equality and mutual respect is propagated by the anthropologists. The principle of cultural autonomy' has been an article of faith with the anthropologists. Integration should be differentiated from forced assimilation. We have got so many linguistic and religious groups who are being integrated to form one Indian nation without anybody making a demand that they should be forced to give up their cultural identity and identify themselves with the majority community. Perhaps, there will be more meaningful and durable 'integration' when every minority group feels secured; when, in this pluralistic society that India is, people can exist as Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs etc., when one can exist here as Tamil,

Oriya, Gujarati, Bengali, Punjabi etc. then why not a person can exist here with respect and dignity as a Santhal, a Gond, a Tharu, a Meena and a Yenadi? Integration can never be achieved under the shadow of threat and no plural society can afford to keep disgruntled, distressed, restless and frustrated minorities in its fold and still aspire for the harmonious development of the countiy. To ensure integration in this way the non-tribals need education as much as the tribals.
