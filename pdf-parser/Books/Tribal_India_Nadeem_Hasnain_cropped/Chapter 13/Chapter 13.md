### Indebtedness

THE chronic indebtedness has been, and still is, probably the most difficult problem facing almost the entire tribal population of India. Consequently one of the worst forms of exploitation to which the tribal people are exposed is through traditional money lending. Barring certain areas in the north-eastern region which were closed to the middlemen and contractors during British rule, indebtedness is quite widespread and crushing among almost the entire Indian tribes.

THE chronic indebtedness of the tribals is certainly due to rampant poverty and deficit economy. Reliable ethnographic evidence prove that the tribal people were certainly not that much handicapped in their struggle for living a carefree life when their places of habitation were isolated and devoid of middlemen and contractors. They living in self-sufficient economic conditions. Forest wealth was at their disposal to sustain themselves. But unfortunately when their abodes were thrown open as a result of economic development all around, they found themselves completely ill-equipped to enjoy the fruits of development. Outsiders, the so-called civilized people, exploited their vulnerability in the absence of any concerted efforts on the part of administration. With the passage of time, their plight continued to worsen and they have been reduced to the position in which we find them to-day. were

ALTHOUGH we have little scientific data about the extent of their indebtedness, it is obvious that the size of the problem is enormous. Indebtedness among them does not have only economic dimensions but social and psychological too. For a large number, happiness and peace desert them, for others it makes the entire sysiem impervious to hope. In many areas it leads to bondedness due to the debt descending from father to son and even to the successive generations.

AMONG a large number of tribal people indebtedness has become unavoidable and thus normal phenomenon of their existence. Following are some of the important reasons of indebtedness common to almost all the affected groups :

- (1) Loss of tribal rights over land and forests;
- (2) Poor and primitive mode of agriculture resulting in deficit supply of food grains;
- (3) Ignorance;
- (4) Expenditure beyond their means due to extravagant spending marriages, deaths, fairs and festivals; on
- (5) Fatalist attitude and locally-oriented worldview; and
- (6) Adherence to panchayat decisions regarding fines for fear of excommunication.

DUE to the above mentioned reasons he is always in need of money and thus becomes an easy victim of exploitation by unscrupulous moneylenders and middlemen. Small amounts borrowed at usurious rates of interest from time to time snowball into a sum beyond his capacity to repay and what little he possesses by way of land is snatched by the moneylender. "No programme of economic development is likely to have any impact on the tribal economy unless vigorous measures are taken to rescue the tribal from the clutches of the moneylender". (Planning Commission's Report of the Study Team on Tribal Development Programmes, 1969).

APART from borrowing in cash a system of borrowing in kind is also in vogue in many parts of the country, especially in Maharashtra and Tripura. In Maharashtra, this system is known by the name of Palemod. Under this system the needy tribals take seed on loans at the time of sowing and return thrice or even four times the original quantity at the time of harvest. Grain taken for consumption during this period or any time during the year is also returned at this rate. Thus, during the harvesting season a major portion of the crop and sometimes the whole crop is surrendered to the moneylender. Likewise in Tripura, a system called 'dadan'xs prevalent. The creditor purchases the crop in advance at very low rates.

## Role of Moneylender

IT IS essential to study the role of traditional moneylenders to understand the failure of various government and semi-government credit agencies to wean away the tribals from their traditional sources of credit.

THE modus operandi of the traditional moneylender is very simple and convenient to the tribal debtors. They are the men on the spot and ever present on the scene. Whenever a tribal needs money for whatever reason, he has to walk a few furlong or less to reach the

moneylender's house where he is always welcome-day in and day out. The moneylender provides him money without any condition, sureties, guarantees and guarantors since an average tribal has veiy little to offer in the way of movable or immovable property. All that he has is his honest desire to fulfil his loan obligations out of his earnings and some land that he may possess. The moneylender recognises these as good security, though at some other places he may demand mortgaging the tribal's land against the loan as prevalent in parts of tribal areas of Madhya Pradesh. By way of any formality the only thing a debtor has to do is to affix his thumb impression on a blank piece of paper or under a draft which he cannot read.

NOW compare this procedure with other sources of credit like cooperative credit societies established by various state governments. Most of these are found to be situated at far off places from the tribal's habitat. He has to encounter a number of formalities, cumbersome procedures and documents. Besides, security and guarantor are also needed to fulfil various provisions of credit disbursement. Normally there is a time lag of at least a couple of months between the date of application and date of disbursement of loan. Then unscrupulous officials demand their share. All these hurdles apart, the government sponsored credit societies advance loans for only productive purposes like improvement in cultivation, purchase of implements, soil conservatioii, '"tc., but the poor tribal needs loans for consumption and subsistence, to fulfil various social and ritual obligations. The moneylender places no conditions and offers loan for any purpose.

THE personal human contact which the moneylender maintains with his debtor is also significant factor. He speaks the tribal's language, knows the entire family history and background and circumstances leading to the debtor's need of money. Significantly, he accepts the repayment of the loan in any form - in cash or in kind.

### Consequences of Indebtedness

SINCE most of the tribal people are illiterate they have no idea of what is being entered in the account books of the moneylender. They put their thumb impression veiy submissively wherever desired by the moneylender and that seals their fate forever. In many cases these transactions are oral and they cannot afford to approach a court of law for seeking redress. But even those transactions, which are recorded in the account books, are nothing but legal fiction because of the wrong entries of inflated amounts and the most the

poor tribal can do is to call the Village panchayat which usually serves the interest of the moneylender. Studies from various tribal areas bear testimony to the fact that in most cases, indebtedness leads to bondedness and land alienation. The total picture of this state of affairs, however, indicates that one or more of the following are the consequences of indebtedness.

- (1) Loss of freedom and the consequent utilization of their labour power by the creditor;
- (2) Alienation of land and its acquisition by the creditor;
- (3) Sale of girls and prostitution; and
- (4) Chronic venereal diseases.

THE heavily indebted among them who are 'acquired\* by the moneylenders'landlords as their bonded labour are incapable of breaking the vicious circle of indebtedness. They are reconciled to their fate and have virtually no stake in life. The most important values for their independent existence viz., economic values have been lost to them. The Koltas of Jaunsar-Bawar (U.P.) are the classical example of the worst consequences of indebtedness and these unfortunate people are carrying the burden of all the above mentioned curses.

## Legislation and Remedial Steps

THE Fifth Schedule of the Constitution empowers the Governor of a state to regulate the carrying on of the business as moneylender by persons who lend money to members of Scheduled Tribes in Scheduled Areas. In pursuance of this provision various state governments have promulgated and enacted various Laws and Acts. Following are some of the important Laws from different states to control moneylending, debt redemption and abolition of debt bondage:

- (1) The Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Areas Moneylenders Regulation, 1963.
  - (2) The Agency Debt Bondage Abolition, 1964.

I

- (3) The Assam Moneylenders Regulation, 1968.
- (4) The Bihar Moneylenders (Regulation of Transaction) Act, 1939.
- (5) The Bombay Agricultural Debtors Relief Act, 1947.
- (6) The Kerala Moneylending Act, 1958.
- (7) The M.P. Anusuchit Jan Jati Rini Sahayata Act, 1966.

- 218\_TRIBAL INDIA
  - (8) The Madras Indebted Agriculturists (Repayment of Debt) Act, 1955.
  - (9) The Mysore Pawn Brokers Act, 1961.
- (10) The Orissa Money lenders (Application of Certain Provisions) Regulation, 1950.
- (11) The Rajasthan Sagri System Abolition Act, 1961.

A COMPREHENSIVE list has been provided in the annexure.

ENQUIRIES by various agencies have revealed that despite regulations the exploitation of tribal people has been continuing unabated. There is a lot of evasion of the regulations and legislation and the moneylenders have taken very little notice of the restrictions imposed on their operation. The Report of the Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes Commission and Planning Commission's Report of the Study Team on Tribal Development Programmes support such findings. This state of affairs continues due to the following reasons :

- (a) The state governments have not made adequate use of the protective provisions of the Fifth Schedule to lend protection to the tribals against bonded labour,
- (b) The state governments have not been able to make effective use of the penal provisions in their existing legislation against evasion by moneylenders,
- (c) Lack of will and commitment, of all reasons, are most responsible for the continued exploitation of tribals by the greedy moneylenders.

PLANNING Commission's Report of the Study Team on the Tribal Development Programmes has summed up the situation with clarity. It is of the view that the attack on tribal indebtedness should be two-pronged if it is to be effective and enduring. On the one hand, long-term credit should be provided to enable the tribal to free himself from the stranglehold of the usurious moneylenders, and on the other hand his repaying capacity should be raised by improving his economic conditions. Cooperative credit should be forthcoming in an adequate measure and the procedure simplified to attract the tribal to take advantage of the credit facilities provided by the society. But the crux of the problem still remains it needs political will, commitment, honesty and integrity on the part of those who are supposed to be protectors of tribal interests. In the absence of these the coming regulations, provisions and schemes shall continue to be treated as mere pieces of paper.

### Land Alienation

ACCORDING to latest statistics nearly 88 percent of the scheduled tribes are engaged in agriculture. The tribals have great emotional attachment with their lands. Agriculture is the only source of livelihood which most of them have known for centuries. The Report of the Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes Commission, 1961, describes the situation with utmost clarity. It says that 'like his brother in the plains the tribal is land hungry. There are several reasons for it, besides the common desire to posses land. One is that those tribals who practice shifting cultivation are growing in numbers and the Jhum cycle is shortening alarmingly in most places. Similarly, those tribals who have taken to settled cultivation are also increasing in numbers. The heavy pressure on land of an ever growing population is more and more apparent."

ON AN average a person dependent on agriculture in India has 1,6 acres of land as against 7.5 acres in the U.S.A. and 4.5 acres in the U.S.S.R. However, there are regional variations as shown below:

| Northern Region      | 1.01 Acres |
|----------------------|------------|
| Eastern Region       | 1.25 Acres |
| Southern Region      | 1.17 Acres |
| Western Region       | 2.29 Acres |
| Central Region       | 2.57 Acres |
| North-Western Region | 2.59 Acres |

DUE to lack of data it is not possible to make any precise assessment regarding the size of tribal holdings in each area separately but selected examples from a couple of states may give sufficient idea of the situation. According to the Report of the Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes Commission, 1961, Gujarat Vidyapeeth conducted a socio-economic survey of Khedbrahama Tribal Development Block in the Sabarkantha district of Gujarat in 1959. It shows that out of 459 families surveyed, 12 were landless and each family had on an average of 5.32 acres of land. some

THE Madhya Pradesh Government conducted an economic survey in selected villages in its tribal development blocks. It shows that average size of the holdings was about 15.59 acres. As a result of the socio-economic surveys, conducted by the Government of Rajasthan, of Dungarpur and Banswara districts, which are Scheduled Areas, it was found that the size of average holdings was 4.40 and 5.95 acres in Dungarpur and Banswara respectively. A similar survey

was carried out in Manipur which disclosed that the size of average holdings there was 2.80 acres.

THE above examples shows that the land situation is by no means uniform in all the tribal areas but there is a lot of uniformity in the ease that most of the tribal cultivators have uneconomic holdings. Their holdings appears bigger in size as compared with those of non-tribal cultivators but the vastness of size is nullified by the poor quality of soil, poor techniques of cultivation and the ever increasing burden of indebtedness

IT SEEMS appropriate to describe the general situation before coming to the crux of the problem-land alienation. Due to spectacular expansion in the means of communication, almost the entire tribal areas were thrown open and the non-tribal people entered these areas with varying motives. The potential land-grabbers among them proved a nightmare for the tribals.

#### Causes

AMONG the major causes for land alienation, chronic shortage of cash has been enemy number one of the poor tribals ever since they came into contact with the civilized world and its monetary institutions. The tribal people are always in need of cash for various purposes like marriages, fairs and festivals, clothing, liquor and a host of needs of everyday life. Due to poor and inadequate yield and uneconomic agriculture they have also to purchase foodgrains from the market. Thus, their chronic indebtedness to the neighbouring shopkeepers and moneylenders becomes the primary factor in land alienation. The omnipresent money-lender posing as godfather and saviour of the tribals is ever ready to advance loan to them without demanding any guarantee and for whatsoever purpose. The only thing a tribal has to do is to affix his thumb impression on a blank paper or against a draft in a language the illiterate tribal is unable to decipher. Sometimes, the loan may be extended on oral commitment. no matter this seemingly innocuous oral commitment may become a commitment to total slavery or forfeiture of land.

OF LATE many tribals have started approaching the state-sponsored cooperative credit societies but their experience with the societies has been no better. Another factor for their approaching the local moneylender is that the cooperative societies advance only shortterm loans for productive purposes while most of the tribals need loans for consumption and subsistence too, which fall short of government policies, But for even those who borrowed from

cooperative societies, the experience often has been nerve shattering. They are not prepared to be imprisoned or their belongings be confiscated in case they are unable to repay these loans. Hence, most of them prefer to take loan from the familiar sources even at usurious rates of interest.

### Case from M. P. and U. P.

ALTHOUGH the problem of land alienation has been rampant in all the states containing some tribal population but it has happened on such a large scale in these two states that its modus operandi may be taken as representative of this evil.

KORWA tribe of Sarguja district of Madhya Pradesh and Tharu and Bhoksa of Tarai region of Uttar Pradesh have been the worst victim of deceit and plunder of their land. The entire region inhabited by the Korwas is surrounded by Muslim moneylenders locally known as Miyan. They are ever ready to advance loan at the slightest pretext with the only condition that the Korwa has to mortgage some of his land. Under chronic conditions of poverty and scarcity they are unable to repay it and the moneylenders occupy the land. Addiction to locally brewd liquor is also an important Reason for taking loans. Although the tribals are exempted from excise regulation of brewing liquor for personal purposes, yet they are not allowed to make their own liquor by these moneylenders and they have to purchase liquor from the illicit breweries of the moneylenders who are not troubled by the excise officials in carrying on their illegal trade. Thus, once caught in the vicious circle of indebtedness, the Korwa is left with no other option but to surrender and forfeit his land.

THE Tharu and Bhoksa tribes of Tarai region of Uttar Pradesh are the victims of Punjabi refugee moneylenders - traders who have grabbed thousands of acres of land reclaimed by the tribals. The climate of this region was always very inhospitable to the nontribal. Malaria was rampan and the land was marsh with abundance of poisonous insects. Due to these reasons the non-tribals rarely entered these areas. Being acclamatised with such a climate, the Tharu and Bhoksa people cleared the forests, reclaimed thousands of acres of land and made it cultivable. With the first wave of invasion of this region by the uprooted Punjabi refugee from Pakistan the entire scene underwent change. The labourious and enterprising Punjabi refugees settled here in thousands and taking advantage of the ignorance and economic vulnerability of the Tharu and Bhoksa

tribals grabbed their land. The new Punjabi settlers adopted the same modus operandi being in vogue in other parts of the country, i.e. advancing loan unconditionally and providing cheap liquor to the tribals.

### Other Methods

ACCORDING to the Report of the Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes Commission, 1961, there are various other methods resorted to by non-tribals to get possession of the tribal land. One is the familiar method of utilizing the machinery of the courts, before which the tribal is more or less powerless. The second is the method of temptation of immediate gain. The tribal under a monetary inducement allows himself to be used by the moneylender or usurper as a witness against himself. The third method is called bazdawa by which the tribal is induced to suffer a decree being passed by a court of law against himself. A fourth is that of the tribal accepting before a court of law that his opponent holds the land by adverse possession. Then there is voluntary surrender. Though those surrenders are usually taken as voluntary, in most cases they are actually engineered by the landlords who take advantage of their victim's ignorance.

THE reasons for this state of affairs are obvious. One of the most important is the lack of adequate knowledge of the real conditions in the tribal areas on the part of the authorities. The tribal is at the mercy of unscrupulous moneylenders who mostly come from outside and who have no interest in maintaining the tribal social structure or improving the tribal economy. The second reason is complicated legislation. Formerly, the tribal panchayats settled all disputes, thus avoiding recourse to endless litigation in costly law courts, the proceedings-of which are totally incomprehensible to the tribal. The great reason, is lack of alternative source of credit which keeps him under the thumb of the moneylender.

## Remedial Steps

TAKING into consideration the three bases of land alienation of tribal people \ iz., (a) the lacunae in the laws, (b) the ignorance of the tribal people, and (c) the complicated legal procedures to be followed, various state governments have been doing something to help the tribals. But except in the hill districts of Assam, Manipur and Mizoram the resulting benefits have been only nominal.

BEFORE looking into various legislative steps taken to safeguard tribal interest in land, it will be in the fitness of things to study the

crucial recommendations of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes Commission, 1961, on the basis of which various states passed a number of legislations. Its major recommendations are as follows:

- (1) "There is need for a detailed scrutiny of all legislation affecting tribals\* land. The complicated procedures that have resulted in depriving the tribal of assistance also require to be examined. All existing Acts and Regulations should be examined by a committee in each state and Union Territory with the ultimate object of preventing completely the transfer of tribals\* lands to non-tribals for some time to come. It may be necessary to amend the present laws drastically in may cases. If this is likely to take time, we recommend that the governors may, in exercise of the powers conferred on them under the Fifth Schedule, issue the necessaiy Regulations without delay.
- (2) "We aho recommend that there should be a general prohibition of all transfer, whether by sale, mortgage, gift or lease under any kind of agreement or contract entered into by tribals in favour of non-tribals without the permission of the Deputy Commissioner or the Collector. The Government should make Rules in consultation with the Tribes Advisory Council governing grant to the permission by the Deputy Commissioner the Collector, after ascertaining the conditions prevailing in each area. or
- (3) "There should be a bar against suits or applications against any such order made by a Deputy Commissioner or Collector and courts of law should be precluded from taking cognizance of such transfers by sale, mortgage, gift or lease or any other agreement or contract and from passing decree thereon unless arrangement has been entered into with the previous permission of Deputy Commissioner or the Collector.
- (4) "Deputy Commissioner or the Collector should have the powers suo moto or at the instance of the aggrieved tribal land holder within a period of 12 years to institute enquiries and restore possession of the land with or without payment of any compensation to the transferee. This provision should be made applicable to all transfers of land by tribals to nontribals with retrospective effect from the 26th January, 1950. Adequate machinery should be created to-implement these laws or regulations.
- (5) "Finally, we recommend that all surrenders must only be to the state, which should hold the surrendered land as a trustee for the tribals".

THE following legislations were in vogue at the time of the above recommendations and hence either they were amended or changed to make them sharper and more protective:

- (i) Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Areas Land Transfer Regulation, 1959.
- (H) The Scheduled Areas Estate (Reduction of Rent Amendment) Regulation, 1951.
- (Hi) Madhya Pradesh Scheduled Areas (Allotment and Transfer of Land) Regulation, 1954.
- (iv) The Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code, 1959.
- (v) Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Land Reforms Act, 1948.
- (vi) Orissa Scheduled Areas Transfer of Immovable Property (Scheduled Tribes) Regulation, 1956.
- (vii) Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955.

A COMPREHENSIVE list has been provided in the annexure part of the book.

SOME of the important legislations enumerated above may be divided into two types: One is protective, intended to prevent non-tribals acquiring tribal land, and the other deals with the question of land reforms. Both types of legislation have fallen short of the needs of the situation. The protective legislation could not be of much use as no sufficient arrangement for alternative credit was made. The land reform legislation could not help the tribal to any great extent because it was too intricate for him to follow. But the most important factor in thii state of affairs is the lack of will and integrity on the part of administration to ameliorate the suffering of the tribal masses. Hence the vested interests exploiting the tribals have been and still are in a position to carry on their nefarious and criminal activities sometime with the help of indifference of officials and sometime with the active, connivance of officials at lower levels. Due to their growing contacts with radical political elements and sincere pro-peasantry cadres of radial organizations, an explosive situation is fast growing up. The Naxalbari movement or Srikakulum uprising should not be considered as mere occasional happenings because the ferment continues and the long exploited tribals are fast gaining consciousness for their rights.

### Shifting Cultivation

SHIFTING cultivation is an age-old institution among the Indian Tribes. This in principle means cultivating a plot of land for a

temporary period and then leaving it fallow. It consists of clearing the forest slopes, burning the fallen trees and bushes, and broadcasting the seed in the ash covered soil. The rest is left to nature. The operation actually starts just before summer season when the trees and bushes are felled and allowed to be dried by the scorching sun during first half of summer. In the second half, they are set on fire and are allowed to bum to ashes. On the ashes produced by the burning of these trees and bushes, seeds are sown at the onset of the rainy season. No other operations are required , and the crop is reaped when it is ripe after rains. The sowing on the plot may be done for one or more seasons but not beyond this. After that, fertility of the soil is exhausted and the plot is allowed to remain fallow. Another plot of land is cleared and the agricultural operations are transferred to it. Meanwhile trees and bushes continue to grow on the original plot and in a few years time it regains part of its original appearance.

THE beginning of shifting cultivation goes back to the neolithic times, 8,000-10,000 year ago. The manner of its origin has often been speculated. With the increase of population during the relatively genial post pleistocene climate, the only possible way of procuring more food, which would have occurred to primitive man, would have been a shift from hunting to cultivation. Keeping into consideration the vast stretch of land then available and the nomadic nature of man, the only remedy would have been to spread a handful of seeds, preferably cereals, small millets, paddy or barley on some suitable patch of land, allow it to grow through the rainy season and reap it when it was ready. After repeating the process twice or thrice when the yield became thin, it would nave been wise to shift this process to another patch of land and hence the cycle of shifting cultivation.

LEACH (1949) opines that in vast tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia and the new world shifting field cultivation is coexistensive with agriculture.

IN INDIA it existed in remote hill areas of Assam Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and to a lesser extent in several other parts oil the country. Although it has been declared unlawful in most of the areas, it still exists on a lesser scale.

THIS type of cultivation is known by different regional names in India. It is called Jhum among the tribes of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh; Bewar or Dahya in Madhya Pradesh; Podu in Andhra Pradesh; Koman or Bringa in

north Orissa. The problem of shifting cultivation is acute in the states of Andhra Pradesh, North-Eastern region, Bihar and Orissa.

THOUGH shifting cultivation has been quite widespread in the above mentioned regions and it is a way of life with its practitioners but the only people who have exalted it into a regular cult are the Baigas of Madhya Pradesh and Orissa. According to their mythology, they were ordered by bhagwan to practise this type of cultivation. This legend grew out of the concept of mother earth and the mother earth should not be tortured through the dagger of plough. Since the shifting cultivation does not require any ploughing, the mother earth blesses the Baiga for the respect shown to her. They also believe that adoption of plough cultivation shall bring misery.

### Two Views

SHIFTING cultivation has always been an eyesore to forest department. They are dead against it on the ground that it is ruinous and wasteful, dries up the springs in the hills, causes soil erosions, destroys valuable forest, affects rainfall and deprive the people of the benefits of the forest and forest produce. Report of the Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes Commission quotes Nicholson, one time conservator of forests »n Orissa, for his statement before the Partially Excluded Areas Enquiry Committee of Orissa :

"The damage done to the forests by shifting cultivation was serious and only under certain conditions where the area of land available is large and population small, such cultivation does little harm"

M.L. BOR, Botanist of the Forest Research Institute, Dehradun in his presidential address to the Botanical section of the Indian Science Congress in 1942 went so far to say:

"Of all practices initiated by man, the most obnoxious is that of shifting cultivation".

MODERN opinion, however, is more liberal and regards this practice as an organic response to certain geophysical conditions. M.D. Chaturvedi, formerly Inspector General of Forests opined :

"The notion widely held that shifting cultivation is responsible in the main for large scale soil erosion needs to be effectively dispelled. The correct approach to the problem of shifting cultivation lies in accepting it not as a necessary evil, but recognizing it as a way of life; not condemning it as an evil practice but regarding it as an agricultural practice evolved as a reflex to the physiographical character of land. For too long.

jhuming has been condemned out of hand as a curse to be ashamed of, a vandalism to be decried. This attitude engenders an inferiority complex and unhealthy atmosphere for the launching of any development scheme seeking to improve the current practice."

S.H. HOWARD, another former Inspector General of Forests suggested that instead of discouraging this method of cultivation, a trial should be given by regulating it, which means that if a longer period of rest is given between the fellings, there is little danger o^ soil erosion. J.R Mills, with his long experience in the tribal areaj of Assam believed that, wisely regulated, the method could probably be carried on indefinitely without causing excessive deterioration.

### Factual Situation and Pragmatic Aspect

ALL THINGS apart, this very fact cannot be ignored or brushed aside easily that nearly ten percent of the Indian tribal population depends on shifting cultivation and they cannot be deprived of their land, their livelihood and their way of life for a theoretical opinion on which not all experts agree.

THEORETICALLY, shifting cultivation is now legally prohibited except in a few pockets of Madhya Pradesh and north-eastern region where it is still practised with the permission of the competent authorities. It is allowed in Madhya Pradesh though grudgingly in the Baiga chak (district Mandala) and Abhujmar (Bastar) and a few other pockets inhibited by Baiga tribals. With the strenuous efforts of Verrier Elwin and support of the late Prime Minister Nehru some parts of north-eastern region were also exempted from this prohibition. In the rest of the erstwhile jhuming areas any violation of the rule is severely dealt with. If the 'culprit' is caught, he is fined and prosecuted, otherwise collective fines are imposed on all the inhabitants of the area.

EVERYONE agrees that it is not ideal method, and that, wherever possible, terracing or other means of cultivation should be introduced. Even some of the sympathisers of tribal cause hold the view that this system of cultivation promotes laziness and inertia among its practitioners.

THE people who practice it have their own version. The Korku, Baiga, Korwa and Maria tribals of Madhya Pradesh and Nagas of Assam and adjoining areas claim that shifting cultivation is done with simple implements like axe, hoe, digging stick, sickle, etc., which they can afford to purchase and repair easily. Whereas plough

agriculture needs a number of costly implements, regulation of time, routine work on the field, money and devotion. Also, their traditions suit this system of cultivation due to their sedentary, carefree and routineless life.

NOTWITHSTANDING its obvious disadvantages, shifting cultivation cannot be stopped with one stroke an it has become a way of life of the tribals who have been practising it for generations. Over vast areas in the interior, where area suitable for terracing is not available, shifting cultivation has to be tolerated. But every effort should be made to regulate this system of cultivation on scientific lines to minimise its after effects and help in building up of the fertility of the jhumed areas.

### Solution of the Problem

THE Report of the Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes Commission, 1961, has given some important suggestions for implementation. Some of the major suggestions are as follow;

- (1) The total replacement of this system, if it comes at all, will be a long term process. In the meantime the proper course is to regulate it, experiment with it, improve it and try other workable alternatives, Shifting cultivation is tied up with tribal way of life and it is thus much more than a technical problem pertaining only to the improved techniques of farming and agriculture. It is a mixed problem, partly connected with the physical conditions of the land and partly with social customs, traditions and beliefs. Any hurried departure may create complications.
- (2) Shifting cultivation may be converted into terraced cultivation Wherever the hill slopes permit and the soil is sufficiently deep, the holds out immense possibilities of improvement, and in many places throughout the tribal areas it has already been taken up with enthusiasm.
- (3) Establishment of agricultural colonies may also be an effective solution to wean away tribals from shifting cultivation to settled cultivation. Some agricultural colonies have already been established in parts of Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh where each tribal family was given some cultivable waste land, financial assistance for the construction of houses and for reclamation of the land, bullocks, agricultural implements and seeds. Facilities for communications, drinking water, irrigation, medical aid etc. were also proposed. But the

result has not been much encouraging partly due to mis-man agement of the whole scheme and partly due to refusal of the tribal psyche to adjust in lower plains and alien lands.

PLANNING Commission's Report of the Study Team on Tribal Development Programme, 1969 straight away suggests that steps should be taken to make agriculture more remunerative by encouraging the tribal agriculturists to take to improved methods of agriculture. The following measures may be undertaken for the purpose:

- (a) Setting up of demonstration farms,
- (b) Distribution of improved agricultural implements, manures and fertilizers and high yielding varieties of seeds,
- (c) Providing credit facilities.

IMPROVED agricultural implements distributed to tribals should be such as would meet their approval.

### Poverty

POVERTY and exploitation are, now synonymous with the majority of tribal population. 'Chronic' and 'mass' poverty had been embedded in India's colonial history. The effort to solve our economic problems and achieve all round development began with our plans which have transformed the country in numerous ways - substantial industrialization, green revolution leading to surplus food production, improvement in the average lifespan and a fast increasing middle class opulence. It is, however, a paradox of our planning that it has failed to improve the living conditions of India's poor. Persistance of poverty is clearly manifest in the country's low levels of per capita income and the substantial percentage of population living below the poverty line, set at the consumption level of Rs. 3500/ subsequently revised to Rs. 6400/-. The Planning Commission estimated the incidence of poverty at 37.4% in 1983-84 and 29.9% in 1987-88. These percentages are for total population and in the rural population and the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribe populations the incidence is substantially higher. However, the expert group on the estimation of poor, constituted by the Planning Commission, estimated its incidence in 1983-84 at 44.8% and in 1987-88 at 39.3%. The figures for 1993-94 are yet to be released. The per capita income at 1980-81 constant prices was Rs. 2362/- in 1993-94. For the 493 million people below the poverty line.

development has been a distant phenomenon, watched from the way side (UNDP, 1993).

THE state of poverty is attributed to various facets inherent in our model of planning and also the socio-political structure of the countiy. Our plans have laid emphasis on industrial growth, both in manufacturing and also in agriculture. In the latter sector we have encouraged lai^ge irrigation projects, chemical fertilizers, etc. which, by and latge, benefit the substantial and not subsistence farmers. It was generally assumed that the benefits of industrial expansion and increased production and employment would 'trickledown' by undertaking a modicum of income distribution have proved to be quite inadequate. Analysts have pointed out that the pattern of state intervention through measures like land reforms, redistribution of agricultural incomes and surplus, adoption of educational infrastructure to employment potentials have been half-hearted and dominated by the entreprenuerial and 'capitalist' class which have gradually obtained a stranglehold over the political and economic regime. As a consequence of these trends, the removal of rural poverty through targetting the specific groups emerged as one of the main objects of the IV Plan and thereafter. Besides, the key issue of land reforms emphasis was laid on certain income and employment generation schemes under a package of anti-poverty programmes. These include schemes for generating employment and creation of assets for rural poor and rural areas, IRDP which would help through margin-money and loans to improve agriculture and develop sources for additional Income, TRYSEM for creating alternate skills for employment, and programmes to enable rural women to get additional incomes. After the early 80s IRDP expansion and its honing to reach the most disadvantaged has succeeded in making some dent on the situation.

THE poverty levels among the Scheduled Tribes are naturally much higher when conipared to the others. In 1983-84 the percentage of persons below the poverty line among the Scheduled Tribes 58.4 in the rural areas (where 94% of them live) and 39.9% among the urban population. The working Group on VIII Plan for the ST estimated that the number of ST families below the poverty line in 1991 was 99.24 lacs. The IRDP has assisted about 42% families upto the end of VIII Plan. However, accurate estimates of families being able to cross the poverty line were not available and IRDP evaluations had placed this percentage at quite a low level. The Group worked out that an investment of Rs. 8000/- per family would be necessary to enable it to cross the poverty line and against this was

the actual investment had been of Rs. 3481/- per family. Moreover, the investment per ST family was substantially lower than the investment on non-ST families. It has been perceived that the impoverishment and marginalisation of the bulk of tribal communities has been intensified in the context of our macro level goals of national development. The tribal populations have gradually been sucked into a process where their resource base and produce have got hinged to a national and even international economy on the one hand and the appropriation of their traditional community rights and economic bases by the state and commercial interests on the other hand. In the words of Dr. B.D. Sharma, former commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, a "careful review of the present situation clearly brings out five levels of deprivation namely (1) non-recognition of rights over resources and restriction of their use; (2) Alienation of workers from the means of production; (3) Denial of due instalment of labour; (4) Bartering of liberty and finally; (5) Psychological state of accepting deprivation and destitutions and demise of self respect and dignity." In other words, the tribals have lost their traditional rights and access to forests and its produce. They are losing their better quality lands to non-tribal cultivators and Being gradually driven to poorer lands and, further, a very large number of them have become wage earners and even the minimum and fair wage is denied to them, even by the government departments. As a result of emphasis on industrial development and large irrigation projects, which mostly benefit the substantial agriculturists, tribals have been displaced from their lands in large tracts. Our legal process has been such that they have been getting a raw deal by way of compensation and woefully inadequate rehabilitation programmes. A study of 22 districts in A.P. (1990) points out that while the SC and BCs were found to be highly responsive to anti-poverty efforts, among the ST, the responsiveness was not so strong. While perceptible dents could be made on the poverty levels of SC & BC households the efforts of development are to be stretched more through innovative schemes for making inroads into the poverty of ST. In the global march of development the wealth on earth is being appropriated by elites impoverishing the nature as well as the vast human masses who depend on these natural resources over the centuries. Adivasis have constantly fought an unequal battle against outside oppressors (Baviskar 1995).

IN THE context of this widespread deprivation and even pauperization on the tribal scene, even the large scale intervention by the state through the impact of anti-poverty and rural employment

programmes, revamped public distribution system for the tribal areas and other programmes with similar aims in the cooperative and other sectors have not so far proved to be extensive enough.

### Employment

BEFORE reviewing the tribal situation vis-a-vis employment, let have some idea about the occupational patterns of tribal population in India. The overwhelming majority of tribal people (about 75%) works in agricultural sector - cultivators and maiginal farmers and agricultural labour. A small segment is engaged in industrial sector as factory labour while further smaller segments like the Todas of Nilgiri Hills, Tamil Nadu, Bhotias of Sub-Himalyan Region, U.R and Gaddis and Bakrewals of Jammu & Kashmir and some others are cattle herders; some are artisans such as Mahalis of West Bengal, Asur and Agaria of Bihar and M. P. are iron smelters and blacksmiths while about seventy small tribal communities mostly located in southern India are foodgathrer-hunters. Of late, a growing number of tribal people have Joined the ranks of migrant agricultural labour and unskilled workers engaged in house construction and brick kilns. In between the total tribal population a microscopic minority of educated tribals are either government employees or professionals such as doctors, entrepreneurs, teachers, etc. Thus, poverty and impoverishment is their lot. The tribal population of north eastern India is a pleasant exception because in this region the model of development has been based upon the axiom of 'education first\*. us

IN THE present scenario the National Rural Employment Programme (NREP) funded equally by Central and State Governments' has been under implementation since 1980. The Rural Undless Employment Guarantee Programme (RLEGP) has been under implementation since 1983. Both these programmes are aimed to rural landless labour, many of whom belong to SCs/STs, particularly in the lean period of the year.

SINCE 1989, both NREP and RLEGP have been merged in to a national rural employment programme named the Jawahar Rozgar Yojna (JRY). This programme is to be funded 80% by the Centre and 20% by the States. The objectives of the JRY are generation of additional gainful employment, creation of productive community assets, and improvement of overall quality of life in rural areas. The special provisions for SCs/ STs in the JRY include preference to SCs/STs for employment, special integrated projects for nomadic

tribes and 15% of the resources at both district and Village Panchayat levels for individual beneficiaries scheme for SCs/STs. Further, monitoring of works exclusively for the benefits of ST and employment generated for STs has been prescribed. Besides these The National Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes Finance and Development Corporation has been established in 1989 mainly for identification of trades/business/professions and other economic activities of importance to SCs and STs and undertaking supportive projects, so as to generate employment and/or raise their income levels (a profile of this organization is given in the chapter dealing with tribal development). However, as the evaluation of tribal development programmes and various official and non-official documents and studies reveal, the employment situation in the tribal areas are replete with exploitation, pilferage of resources, lack of response, callous attitude of the lower level bureaucracy, and a host of other factors.

#### Health

THE normal health of the tribal people cannot be said to be very bad but their condition often becomes chronic after repeated infections. Besides, the fundamental question that arises in this context is that how much of the modem amenities in public health percolating down to the tribal strata of Indian society. Before taking up this question let us examine the problems of health facing the tribals. are

THE tribals suffer from many chronic diseases but the most prevalent taking heavy toll of them are water borne. This is mainly due to the very poor drinking water supply. Even when it is available in plenty, it is mostly dirty and contaminated and consequently the tribals are easily susceptible to intestinal and skin diseases. Diarrhoea, dysentery, cholera, guinea worm, tapeworms, etc., are often the results of this situation.

DEFICIENCY of certain minerals and other elements is also one of the reasons for the diseases. In the Himalayan ranges there is goitre, a disease of the thyroid gland due to iodine deficiency. The incidence of venereal diseases is also high among the tribals of certain parts of Himachal Pradesh, Himalayan Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa and Andhra. Tuberculosis which is intensified by nutritional deficiency is also common in many tribes. Besides, most of the tribal people have not yet developed an immunity and when they

come in contact with new diseases they fall an easy prey to them. According to Dhebar Commission, one of the diseases of which the tribal is mortally afraid is yaws which occurs in the northern region of the Agency Area in Andhra Pradesh, southern Orissa, Chanda district of Maharashtra and Bastar district of Madhya Pradesh. Hansen's disease, as leprosy is now called, is common throughout India and has not spared the tribal people. It is extremely bad in the Agency Area in Andhra Pradesh, in Kikir Hills in Assam, Bankura and Purulia districts of West Bengal, Santhal Paiganas of Bihar, from Mayurbhanj upto Puri in Orissa. Scabies, ringworm, smallpox and anaemia are also common.

DHEBAR Commission is of the view that there is no lack of will the part of the State Governments to do as much as possible in the direction of the health and medical facilities. There are four principal reasons for the shortfall: on

- (a) the need for a correct approach;
- (b) problem of personnel;
- (c) inadequacy of communications; and
- (d) rules about supply of medicine.

IT IS often seen that in many interior areas, tribals are reluctant to come forward for medical treatment because they have got their own system of diagnosis and cure. It is a popular belief among many tribes, especially those inhabiting far flung interior and isolated areas, that disease and misfortune are caused by hostile spirits, ghosts of the dead or the breach of some taboo. It leads to the 'logical' conclusion that what is caused spiritually should be cured spiritually and that is why the tribals of interior areas prefer their own witch doctors, sorcerers, shamans, etc. Medical personnel are contacted as a last resort. This state of affairs becomes further agonising when the physician starts considering the local witch doctor-priest as his rival. Dhebar Commission, interestingly comments that "a pious invalid will send for both the priest and the physician. The priest will pray for him, the physician will give him a pill. The theory is that God answers the priest's prayer by; making the pill efficacious: the physician is the instrument through which the divine compassion works". The local sentiments, sensitivities and susceptibilities should be well taken care of if the fruits of the modern medicine have to reach this section of the society. Dhebar Commission cites interesting examples from north-eastern tribal areas more

where the medical staff has been asked to regard the native medicine man not as his rival but his ally. The doctors have been directed not to be antagonistic to the system of tribal's diagnosis and cure, cease to sneer at it as 'superstitious' and extend to it the sympathy they would feel for any other kind of faith healing and psychological treatment, of which there are ample examples throughout the world. A wise doctor, under such conditions, will make friendship with local priest, invite him to visit his hospital and let him offer prayers and make sacrifices for his patient, exampiing that his own way of treatment is supplementary to his. The work of the local priestdoctor has really valuable psychological function is some cases. If the patient thinks that he is ill because a ghost or a demon has attacked him, only priest can remove the fear and restore confidence to his patient. The essential thing for the medical staff is to take the right attitude to tribal medicine and the tribal priest. "The most successful doctors have been those who have interested themselves in what we may call medical sociolo^, in such things as the tribal pharmacopoeia, the tribal theory of the influence of'dreams on health, tribal methods of diagnosis" (Report of the Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes Commission).

ANOTHER problem in public health among the Indian tribes concerns the shortage of medical personnel and qualified nurses in the face of continued belief in the old system and a steadily rising faith in the new. A majority of men and women of the medical profession are very reluctant to offer their services in the rural and tribal areas. This is due to a number of problems. There are difficulties of housing, education for their children and contact with the glamorous world outside. According to Dhebar Commission, the solution lies in having a special cadre for a period of twenty years to secure the medical personnel required for the tribal areas. Simultaneously, efforts must be made to train the local people, so that after twenty years or so, they will be able to staff their own hospitals. Besides, the use of Ayurvedic and herbal medicine should be encouraged because of the fact that the tribal people are already used to herbal remedies and hence there will be little problem of acceptability.

DUE to local geographical and ecological condition and relatively not easily accessible areas of tribal habitations, the mobile dispensaries and health centres shall be more purposeful than the static one. However, it is also not realistic to provide these mobile centres with ambulance or large vans which often cannot get along the rough roads or tracks even in fine weather. An ordinary jeep is

quite sufficient to take a doctor with his staff and medicines to number of outlying villages. It might even be considered that improved type of bullock cart could be sometimes used for the mobile units. In the north-eastern region these units have to about in the most difficult countryside on foot, and doctors there perform successful operations under the most adverse circumstances in the village camps. It requires sincerity and dedication to work under such conditions. a an move

THE rules and procedures of indenting for medical supplies in the remote areas is very frustrating. The scrutiny of stock is made on the basis of the normal requirements of the plains areas. It is foi^otten that the medical personnel in tribal areas have not only to treat the patient but also brave the rigours of climate and on many occasions to meet the urgent requirements they require the maintenance of stocks of special remedies at hand.

ANOTHER very important problem concerning health in the tribal areas is the addiction of the tribals to spirituous and highly intoxicating liquors and drinks. The indigenous liquor i\$ prepared by fermentation of the rice, millets and other grains. This Is the traditional liquor of the tribals which is prepared within the four walls of the home and consumed by all the family members. The second variety is the distilled liquor which the licence holders from the government sell. It is really an intoxicant and carries little food value. The poor tribals, in most cases, are coerced to discontinue the preparation of homemade liquor and made to purchase the distilled liquor from the contractors. After making them addicts of this variety of liquor they are made to part with the property or enter into exploitative bargains. The only practical solution is the banishment of liquor contractors and the harmful liquor from the tribal areas so that they may be left free to brew their own liquor and fulfil one of their important nutritional and cultural needs by themselves.

DRUG addiction is another serious health problem with several tribes. Singpho tribe of Arunachal Pradesh is a case in point. From 40,000 about 150 years ago, the Singphos have been reduced to around 1,000. Though recurring wars, disease and malnutrition have played a role but deadly addiction to opium is the chief culprit for their fast dwindling population. It is said that opium has diminished the tribe's fertility, increased the death rate and contributed to the vicious circle of poverty. Almost every house of the Singpho has a

small hearth in one of the comers above which hang a blowpipe, a large spatule, a packet of raw tea leaves, opium and tobacco. At any time of the day haggard, skinny tribesmen can be seen making the tobacco-opium concoction that they smoke along with generous swigs of the bitter tea liquor. Opium has become an inseparable part of Singpho life. You can tell a Singpho by smell. They have become too indolent to look after their cattle and lands yet they must buy the opium, mostly by selling the elephants they trap. They have smoked it for decades and their forefathers were induced to it by the British. Official agencies and more importantly some devoted and sincere reformist Singphos and voluntary social organizations have begun a serious campaign to wean the addicts away from opium. Let us hope that they succeed in their efforts.

The speedy spread of health education among the tribals is very crucial. As most of the tribals are illiterate, various audio-visual methods may be adopted to put across to them the basic principles of health and sanitation. Needless to say that for raising the standard of health of the tribals, cooperative endeavour is necessary among organizations and the medical personnel. the States, the Centre, the non-official

### Drinking

DRINKING among the tribal communities has been widely prevalent. The sentimental attachment of the tribals with one kind of liquor or the other is evident from the fact that mahua tree is treated as sacred by many of the tribals and is worshipped. Drinking can be said to be a part of their social milieu from the times immemorial and has to be considered in that context. In an essentially subsistence nonmonetized economy, a healthy drink is as much a produce of the land as any other article of food. It is also seen that most of the locally prepared beverages are not intoxicants. It is an invigorating effect and has some food value also and hence it can be said to have acclimatized to their social situation.

THE indigenous beverage prepared by fermentation of rice and millets has been the favourite liquor of the tribals. It is called by different names in different regions. In Madhya Pradesh it is known as Handia, in Assam as Pong, as Zoo in north-eastern region, as Liidgi in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, as Kalhi in Andhra Pradesh, Pachawe in Bihar and with a variety of names in other tribal areas of the country. The tribals have been preparing and consuming this type of liquor festive occasions, marriages and funeral and othei

ceremonial occasions. Even during normal days when the urge for liquor becomes imperative, home brew may be prepared either at home or in jungle and is enjoyed in the company of a few friends.

THE description given above provides a fairly clear picture of the traditional situation. But with the advent of British administration in tribal areas the tribals lost this sort of independence and their mental peace too, in the process. The colonial administration introduced a system of liquor administration alien to the tribal people. Unfortunately, Ae government and the liquor lobby became interested parties in the drinking of the tribal. Despite their repeated denials that this policy was aimed at increasing the revenue, it was crystal clear that this policy virtually forced the tribal to drink. Thibal Development in the Fifth Plan: Some Basic Policy Papers (1975) quotes W.B. Grickson who stated that introduction of an alien system of outstill in Bastar, not suitable to the local condition, introduced the contractor who was interested in maximising his profit. The old system of a village folk preparing a drink when the village community so desired was discontinued. This resulted in a level of drinking unparalleled anywhere else and untold misery. It quotes another enquiry in Bombay Presidency in 1938 by D. Synington which reveals that "the excise policy of British administration, in making the sale of liquor a source of revenue in the State, had devastating effect the tribal people." on

NOW, let us review the situation in the post-independent period. Article 46 of the Constitution enjoins upon the State to protect the members of Scheduled Tribes from social injustice and all forms of exploitation. Article 47 of the Constitution casts a duty upon the State by prescribing that "the State shall regard the raising of the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people and improvement of public health as among its primary duties and, particular, the State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption of liquor, except for medicinal purposes, of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to health." Furthermore, removal of poverty has been the core of approach of various plans and the first pre-requisite for the removal of poverty is elimination of exploitation. Keeping this objective in mind, our planners have given highest priority to the elimination of exploitation in all the programmes of tribal development. Unfortunately, one of the worst forms of exploitation of the vulnerable tribals is the prevalent practice of liquor vending.

WHILE studying and analysing the problem of drinking among the tribals and its consequent effects on the tribal economy, Dhebar Commission was surprised to find out that in some places distilled liquor has entered tribal areas after independence. They observed that "we do not understand the need for this type of an arrangement when the tribals have their own favourite beverage which, from social as well as ceremonial point of view, they regard as quite sufficient." Prof. N.K. Bose, the Commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (1970-71) describes liquor vendors as "agents of exploitation" in the tribal areas and the Dhebar Commission recommended the discontinuation of the sale of distilled liquor at once.

THE present system of liquor vending is proving to be disaster to the tribal economy. The introduction of distilled liquor sold under licence issued by the government has heaped untold miseries on the poor tribals. It has been observed that "the liquor shops have served as a funnel through which anti-social elements from the advanced areas of the country find easy way into these backward communities. They indulge in all sorts of undesirable activities. The owners of these shops are reported to engage lathaits (muscle men) and create a state of terror in the region. It is alleged that they forcibly enter Adivasi huts without any fear of authority, to check and detect illicit distillation. The licenced shops are also alleged to engage in a large number of Pherrywallas (vendors) who go from village to village and establish informal sub-shops in almost all villages. The tribal community has no relief against these illegal activities. These illegal shops in almost every village become a great temptation to the Adivasi youth. A tribal gets into debt, sometimes imaginary : Land alienation begins notwithstanding the law against it. There are allegations of informal official pressure on the contractor to raise their auction bid. Once the contractor obliges the administration, he takes the administration for granted and does anything he likes in these areas. It is reported that in certain areas there are almost compulsory levies per family or per plough or per marriage in the form of minimum consumption of liquor on the point of threat that if he failed to pay he will be hauled before law for real or imaginary cases of illicit distillation. The strongmen of the liquor trade are able to keep on the right side of lower bureaucracy belonging to various departments, including excise, police, revenue, forest. The tribal considers himself to be alone against this alien groups. Some recent studies tend to show that higher State revenues of excise are positively

#### correlated to high incidence of indebtedness and land alienation {Tribal Development in the Fifth Plan: Some Basic Policy Papers):\*

THE preceding description clearly shows that the tribal addiction to the distilled liquor is a source of many of his miseries and if the tribal is to come out of his age-old slaveiy to moneylenders he would have to be weaned away from liquor. But the evils of sale and consumption of distilled liquor are nothing to do with indigenous liquor, because this brand of liquor has been their part of life from times immemorial without causing any disruption in the fabric of their social and economic life.

THE pro-distilled liquor lobby in the administration has been raising the bogey of increased consumption of liquor in case the contract system is abolished. On the other hand, genuine protagonists of tribal welfare strongly maintain that since a social norm tends to be within limits, in the present situation the local community will decide when to prepare the beverage. It is likely to be limited to special occasions only. No individual will have the freedom of going and getting the liquor as and when he wishes. Besides, physical limitation of availability of mahua and millet will impose an upper limitation on its consumption.

THE picture shall remain incomplete without a brief review of another school of thought. On the other extreme stand protagonists of total prohibition even in tribal areas. Such elements are free to propagate their philosophy but they display their complete ignorance of the ways, values and life of the tribals. They fail to understand that home brew liquor has been a way of life with the tribals and the indigenous beverage, apart from fulfilling some their religious and ritualistic needs, also supplements some of their nutritional deficiency and adds a little cheer to their hard life. Anyway, if they have to give up their own traditional liquor, the initiative has to come from their side. Many of the tribal communities are aware of the evil effects of liquor addiction and consequently in a number of tribal areas strong movements have arisen from time to time which have dissuaded the tribals from consuming distilled liquor. The Bhagat movement in Bihar may be cited in support of the social forces opposing consumption of liquor. Until such a movement spearheaded by the tribals themselves gains ground, nobody should interfere with the normal home brew liquor that the tribals are accustomed to take. Let them attain the consciousness that rice and other cereals can be more suitably utilised and they will give up this habit. But as

a first step to prove their concern for the plight of the tribals, the administration will have to banish the liquor magnates from tribal areas and hit their lobbyists harder than ever.

## Housing

THE problem of housing for the tribal has to be viewed from the aspects of (a) shelter, (b) sanitation, (c) aesthetic tastes, and (d) comparative cost.

ENVIRONMENT occupies an important place in the above mentioned scheme of things. Variations in climate coupled with difference in economic conditions of tribes and types of architecture pose a number of problems. A lai^e number of tribal people are fortunate that they have been endowed with natural bounty. They are <iving in ideal climatic conditions. To the Chota Nagapur plateau, classic home of a dozen tribes, come many visitors anxious to escape the heat of the plains. The lovely Khasi Hills around Shillong and the Lushi or Naga Hills are cool, bracing and healthy. The Maikal Hills of Madhya Pradesh, though less elevated, are cool and invigorating for most of the year. The Nilgiri Hills, home of the Toda and Kota tribes, are famous as tourist resort (Dhebar Commission). But the Brahmaputra Valley of Assam inhabited by many of the plains tribals is oppressively hot in summer. Some of the dense forest districts are dry, airless and dusty and many areas like the plains of Banda and Mirzapur districts U.P., the abode of Kols, are dry, rocky, hot and always prone to water scarcity. At the opposite extreme, in the high mountain areas of sub-Himalayan ranges, the climate is extremely severe and the tribal people there have to face the rigours of snow and wind, rain and storm, glacier and avalanche. A number of tribes lives in the seismic belt, as in some areas of Assam, where they are exposed to the vagaries of earth movements. However, man knows how to adapt himself, even in extreme climates. His housing, like his clothing, is designed to keep out heat or resist cold. In hot areas of north-eastern regions, houses are built with bamboo framework which lets in plenty of air. Where the soil is consistently damp and the rainfall heavy, houses are generally arranged on piles well above the ground to keep them dry. In the cold areas, many of the houses are of stone or in the nature of log cabins.

HOUSE sense coupled with utility and artistic value is another aspect of housing among the tribal people. Many of the tribes have developed a real pride in having good houses. On the other hand.

there are a number of small tribes who completely lack any houses sense. They are content to live in miserable hovels surrounded by insanitaiy conditions, while some other like the Birhors live in houses of leaves. They have perfected this art to such an extent that a Birhors tribal whose hut leaks is fined by the community. The Garo, Mishmi, Naga and Reang tribes of north-eastern region are famous for building beautiful houses combining utility and artistic value. They are raised well off the ground and are suitably ventilated. The people make good floors, weave bamboo expertly and keep their houses spotlessly clean. Same is the case with Gond houses in Madhya Pradesh, Bagata and Koya houses in Andhra Pradesh, Gadaba and Saora houses in Orissa and Oraon and Santhal houses in Bihar, which are usually well constructed with thick mud walls on which the people model or paint designs and pictures. Sometimes the floors and walls are washed with red or white clay or cow-dung.

HOUSING is one sector of tribal life which is not very gloomy but not all tribals are so fortunate. Particularly in the plains, some are landless and homeless and their plight is really miserable. A notable example of this situation is Yenadi tribe of Andhra Pradesh who live on the sufferance of climate, police and local landlords. It is tribes like the Yenadi who need special attention in any scheme of housing because they and their like make use of the vacant land on both sides of the P.W.D. roads and canals for housing purposes until they are driven away again.

THE study Team of Planning Commission on Tribal Development (1969) is of the view that in the formulation of housing schemes for tribals a distinction should be made between plains tribals and tribals living in hilly areas, and that the housing should' fully conform to the local needs, tastes and traditions. As a matter of example, it says that tiled houses are good but suitable thatched houses may be better in terms of comfort and cost. Further, a tribal knows to plug a leak in a thatched house but is helpless when a tile gives way.

MOST of the houses provided by the government for needy tribals suffer from unimaginative and misfit designs. What generally happens is that some architect in the State capital who has never seen a good tribal house or visited a tribe, draws up a type plan which is followed automatically throughout the State. Any scheme of housing on stereotyped lines without taking into consideration tribal customs, practices and superstitions is bound to meet disapproval by the prospective inhabitants of the houses. Consultation with the tribals to ascertain their wishes regarding the designs of house should be

made a condition precedent to the approval of any tribal housing scheme. This is not to suggest that houses built for tribals should not be improvements should be in accordance with their ideas and superstitions regarding layout and design. It may also be necessaiy that the selection of sites and construction of houses are preceded by the due observance of tribal rites and rituals.

THE forest department is another great hindrance in solving the housing problem of the tribals. The unimaginative and reckless bureaucracy has posed such restrictions on the use of forest wealth by the tribals that the entire forest policy has become counter productive as far as the tribal welfare is concerned. It is very dilficult for a tribal to obtain a permit from a forest official to collect the necessary material. In the absence of liberalised rules, the tribals have to faced a number of odds in obtaining their requirement of timber for house building or repairing purposes. This not only adds miseri( to their already hard life but also gives rise to sense of alienation and discontent often leading to separatist and secessionist movements.

HOUSING schemes for such small and impoverished groups as the Yendadis, Yerkulas, and Sugalis of Andhra Pradesh, Katkaris of Maharashtra, Dublas and Naiks of Gujarat, Gujjars of Himachal Pradesh, Paniyans of Kerala and Kurubas of Karnataka, etc., deserve top priority. But it should be kept in mind that even an extensive house is useless for a tribal if he feels uncomfortable in unfamiliar surroundings.

### Education

LIKE all Other sectors of socio-economic life, educationally the tribal people at different levels of development but, on the whole, formal education has made veiy little impact on tribal groups. In the light of the past efforts it is not shocking because prior to 1950, the Government of India had no direct programme for the eduction of the tribals. With the adoption of the constitution, the promotion of education of Scheduled Tribes has become a special responsibility of the Central as well as of the State Government

THE growth of formal education among the tribal populations of the country may be gauged from the lacts yielded by the census data. The census figures of 1931 disclosed that only 0.7 percent of the tribal people were literate. This percentage rose to 32.60 percent in 1991 against 52.2 per cent for the entire country. The literacy rate among the tribal women is obviously much lower. So, the total

picture of spread of education among the tribals is not very encouraging, barring a few tribes of north-eastern region like Khasi, the Garo, etc., who tremendously benefited from the vast network of Christian missionaiy institutions.

SINCE education is probably the most effective instrument for ensuring equality of opportunity, the tribal people are lagging far behind their more fortunate fellow countrymen due to lack of education. Let us analyse the reasons for this state of affairs.

### Social Factors

MORE allocation of funds and opening of schools do not go far in providing education to the tribal people. Social factors play very important role in this respect. Formal education has not been necessary for the members of tribal societies to discharge their social obligations. Hence they should be prepared to accept education and it should be presented to them in such a way as to cut the barriers of superstition and prejudice.

BARRING the tribal communities of north-eastern region, it is still a widespread feeling among the tribal that education makes their boys defiant and insolent and alienates them from the rest of their society, while the girls turn modem or go astray. Since some of their educated boys felt alienated and cut off their links with their families and villages after getting education and good employment, some of the tribal groups vehemently oppose the spread of education in their midst. Besides, some of their superstitions and myths also play their part. Some tribal groups believe that their gods shall be angry if they send their children to schools mn by 'outsiders'.

#### Economic Factors

Some economic factors, too, are responsible for lack of interest shown by the tribal people in getting education. Since most of the tribal people are living in a abject poverty under subsistence economy, it is not easy for most of them to send their children to schools thus losing two healthy hands in their struggle for survival. Verrier Elwin (1963) very appropriately sums up the situation in the following way:

"For a tribal family, to send its grown up girl or boy to school, is essentially a matter of economics; and entails dislocation in the traditional pattern of division of labour... many parents cannot Just afford to send their children to school".

L.R.N. SRIVASTAVA (1968), on the basis of his survey of educational situation among the tribals, also supporte this view by saying that poor economic condition of the tribal societies is a great hinderance to successful education. Almost all the tribes-whether food gatherers, hunters, fishermen, shifting cultivators, or settled agriculturists lack enough food to maintain the family for the whole year. Education, therefore, is a luxury to them which they can hardly afford. Each school going child in a tribal family is an economic unit and contributes to the family income. If the child is taken away from his normal economic work to attend school, the family is deprived of the little income which he brings. Instead, the parents have to feed the child out of their earnings which further reduces the economic stability of the family. According to the present system of education any economic benefit a tribal child can bring to his family will be only after ten or fifteen years of schooling. The parents have neither the patience nor the foresight to wait for such a long period. They can, however, be convinced easily if the education for them can be made productive right from the very beginning.

### Lack of Interest in Formal Education

SHARMA (1976) has rightly pointed out that the "urban middle class oriented educational system has got superimposed on the entire nation both in terms of its structure and content". In many states tribal children are taught through the same books which form the curriculum of non-tribal children of the urban and rural areas of the rest of the State. Obviously, the content of such books rarely appeals the tribal children who come from different cultural backgrounds. Stories of scientific and technological progress, founders of modem India, history and geography of the countiy, etc., of course, form necessary part of any curriculum but the situation demands that their education should start with the teaching of demography, history and ecology of their own region, their neighbourhood and the State. National consciousness should not be imposed from above or outside, but they should be made aware of it in a systematic manner. L.R.N. Srivastava (1968) puts the problem in a more lucid way by saying that "the tribal child who lives in an isolated and far off place untouched by the currents of modem civilization can hardly assimilate any information about history and geography of the country, about the industrial and technical development, uninteresting and out dated stores and about the important personalities unknown and unheard of in tribal areas. He has to be given a complete information about his neighbouring communities, his village life, social organization.

belief and practices, and then pass on to the national scene where we can introduce him to India which is his countiy. Then only he can be able to grasp what is happening in his village, in his state, in his country, and if possible, in other countries of the world".

THIS is a well known fact that education in India has spread in a hapazard way without taking care of future needs. Tribal education also could not escape this anomaly and became instant failure due to apathy, indifference and lack of interest of the tribal people in formal education. S.N. Rath (1981) has put forward the following scheme which is not only recommendatory in nature but also analyses the malady with clarity.

- 1. Under the traditional tribal set-up a child enters adulthood with confidence. He knows his environment thoroughly, knows how to construct his own house, cultivate his field, weave his cloth; in short he acquired all the skills to lead a reasonably comfortable life within the limitations of his culture. The simple skill of reading and writing acquired in an overformal school is no match for this. We cannot afford to push him back to his environment naked. Therefore, a balance should be struck somewhere to evolve a system of curricula where the tribal school, in addition being a part of the national scheme, should have a supplementary curriculum adopted to the specific local conditions.
- 2. The supplementary curriculum should be biased towards crafts and should inculcate a sense of dignity of labour, qualities of cooperation and social discipline. Certain tribal activities like agriculture, dancing, hunting, tribal games and archery must be allowed to find fullest expression in the extra-curricular activities of the school, thus providing some continuity of the traditional values and forms of oiganization.
- 3. A scheme is to be worked out through which the school children shall be able to link up the school and the teacher with their parents and the tribal activities. The school has to act as a centre of dispersal of simple technical know how beyond the skills of reading and writing and become effective agent of social change. This student-teacher-parent continuum should be able to generate a congenial atmosphere, so that the broad purpose of education, which is to enable an average citizen to comprehend the social, political, economic and other processes and forces around him, is fully served. an

4. Needless to say this utopian scheme largely depends upon suitably trained and dedicated teachers.

### Suitable Teachers

LACK of suitable teachers is one of the major reasons for the slow growth of education in tribal areas. Most of the teachers employed for imparting education to the tribal children show little appreciation of the tribal way of life and value system. They approach the tribal people with a sense of superiority and treat them as 'savage' and 'uncivilized' and hence fail to establish proper rapport with their students. The Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes Commission's Report has analysed this situation in the proper perspective. It says that a teacher in the tribal areas must have a thorough knowledge of tribal life and culture. He must speak the tribal language. Only so can he be in a position to act as a friend, philosopher and guide to the tribal people. Actually the gulf between teacher and taught can be best reduced by appointing teachers from the tribal community itself or a separate cadre of teachers for tribal areas, with some inducements, should be created to ser\'e the educational needs of the tribal society.

### Lack of Facilities

ONE of the major problem in tribal education is that of language. Most of the tribal languages and dialects are in the most rudimentary stage and there is hardly any written literature. Hence, the problem of medium of instruction has been a great irritant. Most of the states impart education to tribal and non-tribal children alike through the medium of the regional language, thus making education uninteresting to many of the tribal people. It also hurts tribal sentiments for his language. Hence, some way out has to be found to make education meaningful and productive for the tribal people. own

NATURE of habitat of the tribals is also responsible for slow growth of education. Most of the Iribal villages are scattered. This entails long travels to attend schools. Unless the school is situated very close to their villages and its site approved by the local people the result shall not be encouraging.

SCHOOL building, in some cases, also plays an important role in the growth of education among the tribal fold. Due to mis management, bungling and sometimes financial constraints, the building is seldom suitable to run an educational institution. S.N. Rath (1981) has given a very graphic description of the situation by

saying that dilapidated, often roofless structures standing as lone sentinels in the midst of a featureless sport away from the village are often pointed out as schools.

ANOTHER factor related with the problem is the number of teachers. Most primary schools in tribal areas are "single teacher-managed whose presence in the school is more an exception than a rule". Overburdening may be one of the possible factors for this state of affairs. It will be unjust to expect a teacher to follow a non-stop six hourly schedule of teaching as a matter of daily routine.

THE enthusiasm of tribal people in the education of their children also depends considerably on the timing of school hours in different seasons. The school timings should not clash with their important socio-economic activities and events. People running schools for the tribals have often killed their interest in education by their unimaginative planning. Local conditions and requirements of the people should get top priority in any scheme for running these schools and a balance has to be maintained between the needs of the family and the needs of education.

#### Stagnation and Wastage

TO MANY observers of the situation, the problem of education in tribal areas is the problem of wastage. It is not that wastage and stagnation are peculiar to the tribal communities alone but the extent of wastage is much larger in their case. The problem of absenteeism is a serious one in tribal areas. One sees a large number of students on rolls but the actual attendance is really low, and the number of students passing out at the final examinations is even lower. The real problem is to create such economic conditions as could be conducive to the students developing sufficient interest in their studies.

#### Communication

TRIBALS have been living in isolation for centuries past. The main reason for this isolation is lack of communication. To develop the tribal areas and to improve their economic condition, communication is a sine qua non and its importance in the tribal economy hardly needs any reiteration and emphasis.

THE problem of communication in tribal areas may be examined from two angles: (i) needs of the tribals; and (ii) development of the tribal areas as a whole.

IT IS seen that communication may not always prove to be a blessing. It also facilitates the entiy of prospective exploiters and other anti social elements from non-tribal areas, who, taking advantage of the innocence of the tribals, exploit them in a variety of ways. But at the same time, the march of events cannot be halted and the needs of defence, industrialization, mining and development can also not be ignored. However, one must keep the needs of the tribals in mind before throwing open any area.

NO MATTER what the protagonists of the tribals\* cause think, the communication has been spreading in tribal areas "muchmore speedily than we imagine. It may be that in a majority of cases the development of the tribal consciousness may not keep pace with the development of communications. Realistically speaking, therefore, balance will have to be struck so that this unprecedented expansion does not place an inordinate strain on the tribals and wherever the new roads go, the State will have to protect them against exploitation" (S.N. Rath).

ACCORDING to the Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes Commission, the problem of communications in that tribal areas may be considered from five aspects:

- (i) roads and other communication indispensable for the national needs and defence;
- (ii) roads and other communication indispensable for the industrial development
- (Hi) roads and other communication necessary for administration;
- (iv) roads and other communication needed from the points of view of trade and commercial interests; and
- (v) roads and other communication needed in the interests of the tribals.

ACCORDING to the Commission, a correct approach will be to give the highest priority to (i) and (v); second priority to (ii) and (Hi) and in relation to (iv) decide only after a close study on the basis of the trade and commercial data available and of the relative advantage to the tribal population.

ROADS are the most important means of communication as far as the tribal population is concerned. If we view the situation from the aspect of comparative development, we see that there is a long leeway to be made up. The present all India average length of roads per hundred square kilometers in tribal areas Is very poor in comparison with other rural and urban areas. Many

1

of the rivers in scheduled areas are still unbridged and condititons are such that for several months in a year these areas are cut of from the rest of the world.

AS FAR AS the planning is concerned, a tribal will be more interested in connecting his village with the forest or the weekly market, hospital or the school for his children. If these roads can be used all the year round and can be widened to take carts and jeeps, it will be added advantage. In fixing the relative priorities in this regard, consultation with the local people will go a long way in fulfilling the genuine needs of the tribals. Proper use of locally available materials, like lime and stone, may considerably lessen the cost and consequently open more avenues for fast expansion. If the road construction work is taken up in the off season when the tribals have practically nothing to do, they can earn some money to fulfil their needs for cash. an

MANY of the tribes are very good cultivators of some good varieties of rice, foodgrains and fruits. With a good network of roads, their production will be able to reach far off markets and they will be fetching handsome returns. In the absence of adequate means of communications they have to sell their produce at comparatively low prices and are easily browbeaten by the local non-tribal trader to sell their produce at throw away prices. Top priority should be given to the construction of village roads, bridle paths and motorable roads.

POST and Telegraph services are slowly percolating into the remotest parts of tribal areas but unfortunately the mail carrier (runner) and other staff are not regular employees of the Post and Telegraph department. The runners are usually engaged only for the period that the post can be carried, after which they are left to fend for themselves.

POST offices in these distant places are manned usually by teachers and no regular staff is appointed. Under such conditions the general public are the sufferers because those manning these services do not work with a sense of obligations. But if the tribal people are involved in the management of postal services in a meaningful way, it will go a long way in not only providing gainful employment to the tribal people but also in expanding and improving postal facilities in the hitherto neglected areas.

TELEPHONES and air communication are the other sectors where much is left to be done. There are a lot of places that are neither connected with telephones nor by air communication. These fecilities would be boon to the tribal village in distress. Although, many tribal areas are fortunate in having these services run by defence and police forces, they should be thrown open to the tribals free of cost in the absence of regular services.

DEVELOPMENT of communications no doubt will provide greater opportunities for the tribal folk to develop national consciousness and a healthier intellectual horizon. Also, the importance of communication in the realm of tribal economy hardly needs any emphasis but what ought to be guarded against is the danger 'of greedy and cunning elements from the plains invading tribal areas to exploit the poor tribals. The history of expanding communications throughout the globe bears testimony to the fact that tribals everywhere have been thrown open. The best solution in such a situation seems to be taking all sorts of precautions and safeguards to protect interests before throwing any of their areas open.

# Industrialization & Urbanization

ABJECT poverty and ruthless exploitation have been the plight of tribals everywhere and the Indian tribals are no exception. Ironically, the regions where our tribals people live are some of the richest in terms of natural bounties. They not only hold vast forest wealth but also contain endless deposits of minerals. With the advent of independence, numerous measures were taken to exploit them for materials and large power and irrigation projects. Rourkela, Bhilai, Ranchi, Bailadella, Hirakud, etc., are some of the milestone on the economic and industrial map of modem India. raw

THE natural corollary of this development should have been the economic upliftment of the concerned tribal population. But this did not happen. They were deprived of their lands under statutory conditions and were paid meagre amount in cash as compensation which they frittered away in drinking and celebrating tribal rituals. Most of them became landless and moneyless in the process. Since steps were taken before hand to train tribal youths in the craft which was required in these industrial projects, they became losers from all angles. No doubt, these programmes are a boon to the nation, yet tribal interests cannot be sacrificed. In the initial stages a good number of tribals no doubt got employment in unskilled jobs but once the construction work came to an end they found themselves for skilled and semi-skilled jobs. Now, hordes of outsiders invaded these areas and settled there after getting employment. The no

bewildered tribals were left in the lurch to fend for themselves. Being unskilled, and untrained for any technical job and having place to back to, they settled on the fnnges and peripheries of these vast industrial empires as 'rejects'. no

MARX, while writing on Indian tribals, has very sharply and rightly commented that in the process of industrialization he loses his original world but cannot derive any benefit from the 'new world' which only adds an element of agony and melancholy to the whole episode.

THE problems confronting the tribal people as a result of industialization in their areas may be discussed and summarized in the following way:

### Displacement and Rehabilitation

THE expectation that the industrialization of tribal areas would help in improving the economic condition of the tribal communities has proved to be laigely illusory. Major industrial projects like the mammoth steel plants located in tribal territory far from providing employment opportunities to the tribals, have operated to their detriment by uprooting them from their hearths and homes and offering them no satisfactory alternative to the traditional methods by which they eked out a living in their old geographical and technological environment. The attitude of the projects, even in the public sector, has been that their responsibility to the tribals ended with the payment of compensation for the land acquired from them. A meagre cash compensation is on frittered away on drink and useless rituals and destitution is the price the poor tribal has had to pay for the establishment of industries in the areas inhabited by them.

THE major power and irrigation projects, such as Maithon, Konar and Panchet in Bihar, Mandira, Machkund and Hirakud in Orissa, the steel projects of Rourkela, Durgapur, Bhilai, Ranch and Jamshedpur in Orissa, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar respectively are among the many undertakings that have resulted in a substantial displacement of the tribal problem of deep moral significance. The situation is far from happy for the following reasons:

(a) Very few ofthem have taken advantage of the agriculturalfacilities offered in the reclamation camp. The attraction of easy money and industrial employment has been too strong, especially for the younger generation.

- (b) The alternative land offered by the authorities for cultivation is not irrigable and cannot offer adequate return to maintain the families on it.
- (c) The cash compensation that is given is seldom utilized for productive purposes. It is almost invariably used up on daily living expenses until alternative employment is found.

FURTHER, no space is provided to the tribals in the newly constructed township on the site of the project. They are left to construct and inhabit dirty slums on the outskirts or on the vacant lands in the township itself. Needless to say, these slums are without any civic amenities like tap water, garbage disposal, drainage etc.

## Psychological and Social-Cultural Adjustment

INDUSTRIALIZATION throws open the entire area for all sorts of people and the iron curtain of isolation and seciecy is shattered to pieces. Das and Banerji (1964) have enumerated the following changes coming up under the impact of industrialization with which the tribals have to adjust themselves:

- (1) Being agriculture-minded for generations, the tribal factory worker has not yet been fully reconciled to factory life where he works for economic gain only.
- (2) Being accustomed to lighter and seasonal work as farmer for generation, a tribal factory worker at heart does not like the hard labour or routine factory work, and this affects his productivity.
- (3) Industrialization has tended to produce mostly nuclear type of families among the tribals living in an industrial area leading of inter-personal of individualistic attitude and consequent lessening of inter-personal attachment in the family. This is mostly due to economic pressure and lesser facilities not permitting maintenance of large family in an industrial area.
- (4) Traditional authority of the elders in the family has been considerably weakened.
- (5) Traditional restrictions about marriage are often being flouted by the younger generation, sometimes even to the extent of marrying outside the tribe. Divorces have become more frequent.
- (6) Traditional pattern of ritualistic observances in marrying has been much simplified or shortened on financial grounds and from lack of sufficient leisure.

- (7) Contact with people of different communities and different regions has broadened the view of the tribals and helped them get rid of superstitious beliefs and customs to a great extent. This has further accelerated the understanding of other peoples and their cultures which has been imperceptibly imbibed by them to an appreciable extent.
- (8) Tribals are generally advancing towards integration with the general mass of people, but at the same time they are rapidly losing their traditional social-cultural characteristics.

ANOTHER point with which the tribals are trying to adjust is the change of unit of labour. In their traditional agrarian economy, the family was functioning more or less as a unit of labour. In the factories, however, it is the individual who is wanted. Since not much data are available about the problems of psychological and social-cultural adjustment it is difficult to gauge the impact of industrialization from this particular angle. But one thing is fairly clear. From the membership of a closed society he is being induced to accommodate himself in a universal pattern of cosmopolitan society without education, equipment and resources. There is a crisis of identity.

### Migration

DEEP emotional attachment with one's native place or traditional habitat has been a universal phenomenon. Simple societies primitive groups are more attached with their land because of their traditional relative isolation. Thus, one may safely conclude that migration does not, usually, take place under normal circumstances. or

MIGRATION is not an old practice among the tribal communities. The possibilities and avenues of migration have increased only with advent of fast and easy means of transport and communication. The tribal migration may be understood from two angles. The first is through Pushed Out Factors and the second is Pulled Into Factors that force the tribals to leave their lands. In the first category such factors as socio-economic exploitation, starvation, diseases and natural calamities like drought, food, epidemics etc. In the second categoiy come attractions of employment, better income and better living conditions. Sometimes, the migration is the result of both these types of factors and a number of tribes have migrated to cities, townships and other far off places. come

TRIBAL migration is not a very recent phenomenon and the examples of the tribes of Bihar and Bengal like the Oraon, Santhal, Ho,

Munda etc. going over to the tea plantations of north Bengal and Assam bear testimony to this fact. But an organised type of migration through the middlemen and the contractors is definitely a new phenomenon not going back beyond 20-25 years. The enclaves of prosperity and 'green revolution' have been attracting the poor and exploited tribals. There has been large scale migration to Punjab, Haryana and Delhi from the tribes of Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal; because of disturbed conditions in Punjab, migration to its big farms alongwith the Haryana's has virtually come to an end but migration to other regions continues. Previously, it was largely 'seasonal migration' but of late the tendency of 'Permanent migration' is more visible. According to the surveys undertaken by the concerned agencies and the newspaper reports the plight of many tribal migrants is not good. They have fallen victims to all sorts of exploitation including sexual abuse. Many of them are made addict of opium or other narcotics by the landlords brick kiln owners and are forced to work for prolonged hours against meargre wages. or

A NUMBER of social scientists are of the view that migration is a natural and rational phenomenon in which migration taken place from the labour surplus areas to the labour deficient areas. Whatever may be the interpretations the fact remains that the tribal people are much more vulnerable to exploitation than the other segments of the society. One of the reasons of it is that they are not organized but wherever they become united and get radical left leadership they are able to fight exploitation.

## Depopulation

DEPOPULATION presents a tragic aspect of tribal India. It can be understood through two angles the social-cultural aspect, and the biological aspect. If a human group leaves its traditional habitat and migrates to an unknown place in such a way as not to leave any clue to their whereabouts, they become a case of total depopulation for their erstwhile neighbours, administrators and social scientists. Many a tribal groups have 'vanished' in this way because of exploitation, deprivation, negligence or natural calamities. In the district and region wise compilation of tribes, castes and communities done by such British administrators as Thurston, Crooks, etc. we come across the descriptions of many tribal communities we do not come across these days. But here, we shall be focussing our attention on the biological aspect of depopulation which is universally accepted.

IT IS a paradox that on the one hand the population of large tribes viz. Bhil, Gond, Santhal etc. has been increasing on the average national rate, a number of other tribes are moving towards total extinction. The majority of such depopulating tribes inhabit different regions of south India. Most of these tribes are primitive food gatherers - hunters and they have been recognised by the administration as primitive tribal communities. Special projects have been launched for their socio-economic development so that they are able to survive. This special category consists of about 80 tribes. Some of the most glaring examples of depopulation are the Chero, Mai Pahariya, Birhor etc. from Bihar, Chenchu from Andhra Pradesh, Kadar from Kerala, the primitive tribes of the Andaman and Nicobar islands especially Onge. Jarwa and Great Andamanese and the Raji of Uttar Pradesh. In this category the tribes like the Toda of Tamil Nadu and the Jounsari (Khasha) of Uttar Pradesh may also be included whose populations have been either stagnating or showing only mai^inal increase.

THE main factors responsible for the depopulating trend of such tribes are radical changes in ecological conditions, abrupt disturbance man-nature equilibrium (mainly because of rapid deforestation) and the dehumanization of the forest policy and its cruel and faulty implementation. Paucity of safe drinking water, malnutrition and undernutrition and a number of diseases as epidemics have virtually become the fate of these tribes. in

IN THE welfare administration is really serious in doing something for the tribal populations they should not allow or introduce abrupt and sudden changes in their socio-economic life. The forest policy should be rationalised and humanised, health care schemes should be launched on war footing, ruthless exploitation should be checked and education should be taken on top priority to break the barriers of fatalism and superstitions.
