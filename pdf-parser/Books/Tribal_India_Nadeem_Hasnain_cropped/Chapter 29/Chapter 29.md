Chapter 29

LIKE any other society, tribal societies too undergo change. The pace of change definitely increased after independence when special welfare and development measures were taken up by the State for the socio-economic development of the backward segments of Indian population. Therefore, when we look at social change in contemporary tribal societies we largely analyse and evaluate the impact of developmental programmes and modern democratic institutions on our tribal populations.

A RANGE of differences in the geographical locations (accessibility), population, cultural variations, levels of economy and context situations of the tribals have contributed to the differences in the impact of developmental measures, modern democratic institutions and other policies pursued by the State for these communities. Further, social change has also been caused by the opening up of the tribal areas as a result of the economic and political forces. Therefore, it is not an easy task to describe or quantify the change brought about due to all such factors. By and large the response of tribals has been mixed and uneven. If we examine changes as a result of the developmental process we come across situations which may be positive as well as negative with differences in their degree from one tribe to another and within the same tribe.

CHAUDHARY (1990) in the introduction to Tribal Transformation in India (5 Vols.), while highlighting their unmatched plurality, points out some salient facets of the change which are (i) Transformation from a marginalised and peripheral existence to an acute awareness of their civic rights, (ii) Their progress or development has not been upto expectations mainly due to the deficiencies in the formulation and implementation of the programmes, such as their not being fully responsive to the local felt needs; their implementation by persons lacking sympathy and insight into the tribal culture; the process of elite formation; and their being pushed into a macro capitalist market economy, (iii) The elite class has emerged through the present democratic institutions and have cornered developmental benefits.

IN HIS opinion the situation demands serious thinking and building up of processes and conditionalities in the development programmes to meet these situations.

THE Peoples of India Project (Anthropological Survey of India), completed in 1994, studied 635 tribal communities - tribes, their groups and segments including territorial units. It has come out with some quantitative data regarding tribal participation in the mainstream and their responses to developmental effort. The following changes are largely traceable to the development efforts. An elite stratum of entrepreneurs, businessmen (156 tribes), teachers (380), administrators (156), Engineers/doctors (150) and defence personnel (178) has been created; There has been a rise in the political leadership with the number of tribes playing leadership role at various levels being - Village Panchayat (362), Regional (185) and National (45); Response to education has been favourable in case of both boys and girls and incidence of dropout is less in the tribal communities. Educational level has increased from 8.53% in 1961 to 16.35% (excluding Assam) in 1981; The tribes avail of health and medical facilities and 531 tribes (83.5%) have expressed favourable attitude towards these facilities. There has been a decline in death and rise in birth rate; Many tribal communities are aware of and participate in self employment sche nes initiated by the government. Their number being agriculture (438); animal husbandry (302); piggery (160); basketry (151); poultry (164); fisheiy (98), small scale industry (67), etc. the electronic media cover the tribal areas well-radio (91%) and TV. (27%).

H.M. MATHUR citing Furer-Haimendorf says that development has succeeded in creating positive and desirable changes in several tribes. Their social economy level should be slowly rising and so is their participation in national life. However, certain groups create a drag on the process.

THE general trends described above are discerned if a macro level view of tribal change is taken. But many micro level studies, more often than not, give a different impression and throw up many important issues and policy questions related to our tribal policies and programmes, such as: (1) What are the potentialities of current development strategy to deliver goods. (2) What are the alternatives and whether directions of development are quite desirable and the sections which gain through these measures are the real needy ones. (3) How the impoverishment and powerlessness of the common tribals is traceable to national policies like forest policy, construction of large projects, heavy mining and industrialisation and the direction of agricultural policies. How this can be prevented and eliminated. The situation has been labelled as 'internal colonisation'. (4) The

investment in tribal areas specially through TSP have been going up but analysts find that investment on infrastructure has consumed most of these resources and they question how these investments benefit the ordinary tribals.

THE above situation together with remedial action has been reflected by Dr. Bhupender Singh in his Sixth Plan Mid-Term Appraisal (1983). He concludes that : the shift in the planning strategy in favour of family oriented programmes initiated in the VI Plan has to make further strides. Till mid Sixth Plan the funds flowing into this programme were meagre. But a beginning has been made and they are liable to make their impact felt.

THOUGH, targets achieved in family oriented programmes have exceeded the proposed numbers but a precise idea of the capacity of families to cross the poverty line is not available. The situation needs to be closely monitored and evaluated. The much needed planned coordination between family based programmes with infrastructural and human resource development need a finely balanced planning. The unified administrative structure concommitant to mobilisation and project plans has to be created and made responsive and accessible to the common tribal. The regional imbalances reflected in the export of national resources from tribal areas should be remedied so that these resources benefit the tribals. resource

## Case Studies

#### HUNTER GATHERERS

GADGIL & Guha (1992) have adduced evidence that this group of tribal began loosing control over their means of subsistence from the early part of colonial rule. This has forced them to take to other survival strategies, as well as disoiganisation and impoverishment. Jenu Kuruba with their vast traditional knowledge of forests now help the Forest Department in rearing elephants and collection of forest produce earning a mere pittance while creating laige earnings for the Forest Department Hill Pandaram (Kerala) live as trespassers, in mortal fear of Forest Department servingits officers. The Chenchu have taken to crime in certain areas. Baviskar (1995) has traced criminality among the Bhil and the Bhilala of Jhabua district in Madhya Pradesh to the growing control of the State over the forest resources and degradation of cultivable lands. GP. Reddy's study ? (Satyanarayana, 1990) highlights the failure of Chenchu resettlement scheme. The deficiencies were that little time was allowed for their reorientation into agriculture and poor management of agriculture

operations by project officers, insenstivity of the officers to the social organisations and individualistic way of life of the Chenchu, creation of large agricultural colony which did not suit the smallgroup way of life of the Chenchu, and creation of Chenchu settlements amidst ryots who were afraid of them and actively discouraged Chenchu resettlements.

#### Artisans

GADGIL & Guha (1992) have pointed out how certain artisan activities such as ironsmithy totally died out and Agarias and Asurs had to take to poor agriculture or wage earning. Further, the availability of raw materials for other crafts like basketry and the high price charged for bamboo by the forest department has contributed to the impoverishment of the tribals. Chaudhary (1990), discussing the situation among 49 tribal communities having first level involvement in handicrafts concludes : (a) though many tribal crafts have emerged as very popular, government scheme for their promotion are not quite beneficial to the tribal craftsman themselves; (b) poor marketing of the original craft-ware has led to imitation objects coming into the market causing loss to the genuine artisans.

ANOTHER study of the Dhokda crafts among the Dhurva of Madhya Pradesh also points out similar drawbacks, particularly the deficiencies in the government schemes related to training, supply of tool-kits and marketing.

# Shifting Cultivators

SHIFTING cultivators have also suffered as a result of government forest policy and the deficiencies in the alternative economic development programmes. They have, however, been resisting the government policies in a more concerted manner (Gadgil & Guha 1992). These resistance movements have mostly brought reprisals and sometimes relief, for example the success of Hill Madia move against pine plantation. Even though it has been realised often that the shifting cultivation should be controlled and substituted by a whole package of alternative pattern of cultivation and forestiy, achievement of such a programme have been quite limited. Three case studies in Tripura give the impression of a partial success. Jhum continues to be popular though settled cultivation was gaining ground. Alternative packages viz., animal husbandry, plantation and horticulture have achieved some success. Plantation has been taken up by a section who have become substantial land owners as a result of tenancy

reforms. A class of landless agricultural workers unknown earlier in the tribal areas have emeiged as a result of the taking over of Jhum lands by the forest department. These people now are wage earners in the plantations.

# Settled Agriculturists

THAKUR'S study in Dumka which related to adoption of improved agricultural techniques by tribals points out that though tribals have been made aware of various techniques they have adopted only some, for instance, line sowing and manure pits which did not involve extra expenditure. Use of chemical fertilisers has not been successful and caused even losses because of lack of irrigation. In fact dry farming research suitable for tribal areas is still wanting. The extension agents have also shown a lack of genuine interest and enthusiasm.

MAHAPATRA'S study of Mayurbhanj also highlights a similar situation. He has specifically pointed out that creation of change needs sustained efforts. Introduction of technological changes should also be synchronised with agricultural ritual cycle and the role of tribal priests. Another study among the Santhal in Bihar pointed out that out of eight Santhal sub-groups, the Murmu (priest), the Mardi and the Tudu who are most influential and landed have gained the most through the planning process, depriving the other groups.

## Moderndemocractic Institutions

THE People of India study, discussing the Gond, points out that the statutory panchayats are the elected bodies. These, however, have their activities limited to planning and implementation of welfare and developmental activities at village level. 'Apparently there is no clash between the traditional Gond leadership and the statutory panchayats as yet and the village leaders who have emeiged here are powerful men active in village politics and close to power structure.... and, nowadays most of the traditional panchayats have restricted their activities to deciding marital disputes.

PRASAD'S study of role of tribal leadership in rural Bihar fostered by the panchayat raj found that this emerging leadership was not much different from the traditional leadership in their background (education, sex, occupation, etc.) but they were inadequately trained for their role. They are quite representative but qualitatively weak. Significantly, they show a lack of any collective effort to help the masses and are oriented more towards self aggrandisement and fulfillment of their private needs. He

underlines the similarities between this emerging tribal leadership and the mainstream Neta (leader) culture.

THE state of the old traditional institutions in the tribal areas and their relationship with the formal statutory institutions has been critically examined in the 29th Report of the Commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The report points out that: (1) The traditional self governing institutions, a living facet of tribal life, have now no role in administration, development process, etc. and they get no benefits of new ideas and are isolated. Usually these institutions come into play when certain vital matters reach a crisis situation. (2) The formal institutions given to tribals in the name of self governing system could not become their own. These are largely ineffective and routinised in functioning. In fact they have become a cause of social discord due to the politics of votes and the emergence of unhealthy leadership. (3) The dichotomy of the situation i.e. social matters going to traditional institutions and others to statutory bodies has left V/e simple, common tribal confused and disillusioned.

THE VII Plan discusses the desirability of recognising the traditional institutions which command widespread respect and are deep rooted. The VIII Plan while discussing measures needed to ensure tribal participation in development process recommends that traditional tribal institutions should be blended with the new system to ensure better participation of tribals. The case studies mentioned earlier also point out to such a need. However, in spite of this realisation no concrete steps, say inclusion of some traditional panchayat heads, etc. in the statutory bodies, without elections, have so far been tried. On the other hand moves are afoot in some states like M.P. and Manipur to invest more power in elected bodies by adapting the VI Schedule of the Constitution. Dr. B. D. Sharma (29th Report) goes to highlight quite a different model - the Raisabhas of Adilabad in A.P. : a confluence of the New and the Old - where a village community comes together as a group to deal with all outsiders including the government departments.
