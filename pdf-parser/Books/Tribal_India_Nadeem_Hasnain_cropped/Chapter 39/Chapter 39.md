aforesaid a notification issued under the said clause shall not be varied by any subsequent notification".

For discharging constitutional obligation, Census Organization 2. has been collecting data on SCs and STs population since 1951. The Primary Census Abstracts (PCA) of the SCs (Table A-8) and STs (Table A-9) population of 2001 Census at district, state and aggregated at the national level, have been published for each State/UT. The present volume contains individual caste-wise (scheduled) and tribe-wise (scheduled) PCA for each State/UT. The information is about their population as well as child population, literacy and work participation of each SC and ST by sex and residence presented in A-10 & A-11 Tables. This will be useful for micro level policy planning as well as academic research.

### Brief historical perspective

- 3. An overview of the historical perspective of presentation of caste & tribe wise data shows that prior to 1931 Census, information was collected and published for each of the castes and tribes separately. At the 1931 Census, tabulation of data for individual communities was limited to: (i) exterior castes, (ii) primitive castes and (iii) all other castes with the exception of (a) those whose members fell short of four per thousand of the total population and (b) those for which separate figures were deemed to be unnecessary by the local government.
- 4. At the 1941 Census, 'group totals' were tabulated for Scheduled Castes/Tribes and Anglo-Indians. Separate totals were provided only for a few selected individual tribes.
- 5. When preparations for the 1951 Census were undertaken, the Government of India had accepted the policy of official discouragement of community distinctions based on caste. It was decided, therefore, that no general race, caste or tribe enquiries would be made but an enquiry would be made regarding race, caste or tribe only to the extent necessary for providing information relating to certain special groups of the people who are referred to in the Constitution of India.

## Enumeration of Scheduled Castes (SCs) & Scheduled Tribes (STs) population:

In each decennial Census since 1951, SCs and STs population 6. have been enumerated strictly in accordance with the

#### TRIBAL INDIA 563

Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 and the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order. 1950, as amended from time to time. These Presidential Orders contain the list of SCs and STs separately for each State/UT and which are valid within its jurisdiction, At the 2001 Census, the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act. 1976 was in force in most of the States/UTs. Besides, the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Orders (Amendment) Act, 1990 which pertains to modification in paragraph 3 of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, was strictly followed for the purpose of enumeration of SCs population in the country. The State/UT wise SCs and STs list used at the time of census operations is at Annex.

At the 1991 Census, two questions were included in each of 7. the Household Schedule and Individual Slip. While through question 10 of Household Schedule and question 9 of Individual Slip, inquiry was made in regard to SC/ST status of the person, the name of the SC/ST was enquired through question 11 of the Household Schedule and question 10 of the Individual Slip. Against this, at the 2001 Census, information on the SCs & STs was ascertained through question numbers 8 & 9 of the Household Schedule. The question 8 enquired, "If Scheduled Caste, write name of the SC from the list supplied. It was clarified that the SCs can be only among Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists. Whereas question 9 enquired, "If ST write name of the ST from the list supplied". It was clarified that the STs can be from any religion. There was thus a major departure from the past in respect of designing/formatting of questions in the census schedule to elicit information on SCs/STs as well as the procedure followed for determining their population. One of the reasons for it was the adoption of advanced technology to scan the census schedules through high speed scanners and create ASCII records by converting the hand-written data from the schedules into digitized form through Intelligent Character Reading (ICR) software for further processing of census data.

Under the constitutional order, 1950 as amended in 1990, SCs 8. can be only from Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists while STs can be from any of the religions. The question on religion of each individual was canvassed through question no.7. The SC/ST status of each member of household was ascertained by

#### 564,TRIBAL INDIA

asking whether she or he belonged to SC or ST. If the reply to either of this question was in the affirmative, the name of caste/tribe to which the individual belonged was recorded, provided the name of caste/tribe returned featured in the approved list for the State/UT. The enumerator was supposed to record faithfully in the Household Schedule, the name of SC/ST as revealed by the respondents.

9. Specific instructions were given to the census enumerators to tally the name of caste/tribe returned by the respondents with the names in the SCs/STs list supplied before it is recorded under the appropriate column of the Household Schedule, in spite of all this, in many Household Schedules, the pame of SC or ST was recorded in generic terms like 'Harijan', 'Adivasi', or surnames like Ramteke (generally used by Mahar) and Banjare, Miri, Kureel (generally used by Satnami, a sub entry under Chamar in Chhattisgarh) etc. In several cases, spelling or phonetic variations of scheduled caste/tribe names were also returned. ^

Such census returns were all considered by the Task Force which was specially constituted for this purpose before finalization of the SCs and STs population.

# Finalization of Scheduled Castes (SCs) & Scheduled Tribes (STs) population :

10. Based on the information returned in response to questions 8 and 9 of the Household Schedule, the population of SCs & . STs for each of the State/UT has been compiled. In the earlier censuses, total population of SCs & STs was finalized at the time of the manual compilation of the Primary Census Abstracts (PCAs) by the Regional Tabulation Offices which were specially set up for this purpose. This was done, based on response to question no. 10 of the Household Schedule whether the person belongs to SC/ST. The individual SC/ST population for each state waj finalized later. In 2001 Census, the SC and ST returns have been coded directly on computers based on information recorded in column nos.8 & 9 of the schedule. The response on 'Religion\* wherever required, was considered along with the processing of PCA. Two 'Special Task Forces', one On "Religion\* and the other on 'SCs/STs\* set up under the chairmanship of RGI with officials drawn from the Social Studies Division, Census Division and each Census Directorate for scrutiny and appropriate were

classification of the responses.

11. The task of the 'Special Task Force on Religion' was to appropriately merge or group the new responses and code them into the appropriate religious community based on available literature and local knowledge. The Task Force on SCs/STs examined the different SC and ST entries and classified them into appropriate category based on the Presidential Notification as well as the available literature. Thus, systematic and scientific approach was adopted to firm up both the religion of each individual and the scheduled caste/ tribe status of each one of them. The total population of both SCs & STs in 2001 Census, has been finalized by aggregating the population data of individual SC and ST at the appropriate geographical levels.

# State Primary Census Abstract for Individual Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST):

Tables A-10 and A-11 in this publication include State level 12. PCA on each SC and ST. They present their population including institutional and houseless population, by sex and residence, population in the age group 0-6, literates, total workers, main and marginal workers classified by the four broad industrial categories, namely, (i) cultivators, (ii) agricultural labourers, (iii) household industry workers, and (iv) other workers and non-workers. The district level population distribution of each SC/ST by sex and residence has been provided in the Appendix to the Tables. It is important to note that the Census results for Mao Maram, Paomata and Purul sub-divisions of Senapati district of Manipur were cancelled due to administrative and technical reasons although the population census was carried out in the sub-divisions as per schedule. Therefore, the Primary Census Abstracts presented in this volume exclude the population of the three sub-divisions of Senapati district while presenting the data for Manipur State as well as that of Senapati district.

The caste-wise and tribe-wise data are presented as per the 13. SCs & STs lists of the State/UT, For the State of Nagaland and the UTs of A&N Islands and Lakshadweep, only ST data has been given as no SC list exists in these State/UTs. Likewise, in the States of Haryana and Punjab and UTs of Chandigarh, Delhi and Pondicherry, only SC data has been provided because there is no notified ST in these States/UTs.
