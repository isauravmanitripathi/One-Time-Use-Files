THE term 'tribe' is nowhere clearly defined in the Constitution and in fact there is no perfect or foolproof definition anywhere. To the ordinaiy man the word suggests simple folk living in hills and forests with their 'exotic' customs and practices; to people who are a little 'better' informed, it signifies 'colourful' folks known for their dance, songs and folk medicine; to an administrator it means a group of citizens who are the special responsibility of the President of India; to an anthropologist it indicates a special field for the study of a social phenomenon. In their own way all these impressions are correct.

THE Constitution has defined a 'tribe' to the extent that the Scheduled Tribes are "the tribes or the tribal communities or parts of or groups within tribe or tribal communities" which the President may specify by public notification through Article 342. This ambiguity sometimes leads to confusion in classifying and identifying a tribal population for declaring it a Scheduled Tribe, but it should not be regarded as a hindrance in implementing tribal welfare programme (see the earlier chapter on the concept and definition of 'tribe' and issues involved with it).

WITH the dawn of independence and adoption of the Constitution of free India, the responsibility for their welfare and development was placed on the popular government through the President and Governors. In pursuance of the Directive Principles, special articles have been provided for the welfare of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. Most of these are common to both these categories while a few exclusively meant for either of these. These Constitutional provisions may be divided into two groups underlying the following themes:

- 1. Protection
- 2. Development

THE protective provisions, essential for their development, are meant to provide them protection from social and economic exploitation and injustice. The provisions relating to the development of the Scheduled Tribes are meant for providing them positive steps for their socio-economic development. Following is the summarised narration of these Constitutional provisions.

#### **Protective Provisions**

### Article 15(4) -Promotion of Social, Economic and **Educational Interests :**

THOUGH Article 15 prohibits any discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth but the clause (4) of this Article provides an exception to this. It empowers the state to make any special provision for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes of the citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. This provision is in accordance with the policy envisaged in Article 46 that the state should promote with special care educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and protect them from social injustice. This clause has been especially incorporated to prevent any special provision made by a state for the advancement of socially or educationally backward classes of citizens from being challenged in the law courts on the ground of its being discriminatory.

### Article 16(4) - Reservation in Posts and Services and Article 19(5) : Safeguard of Tribal Interest in Property :

WHILE the right of free movement and residence throughout the territory of India and of acquisition and disposition of property are guaranteed to every citizen, special restrictions may be imposed by the state for the protection of the interests of the members of the Scheduled Tribes under Article 19(5). Since they are vulnerable to all sorts of deceivement and exploitation, hence there are various provisions disabling them from alienating even their own property except under special conditions. In their own interest, laws maybe made restricting the right of the ordinary citizen to move freely or settle in particular areas or acquire property in them.

### Article 23 : Prohibition of Traffic in Human Beings, Forced Labour, etc.

IT PROHIBITS traffic in human being, begar or forced labour and other similar forms of forced labour. This is a very important provision because the Scheduled Tribes being much vulnerable to economic exploitation may be made bonded. In fact a substantial number of tribal population in the country has been leading a miserable life in bondage (for details see the chapter on debt bondage and bonded tribes).

### Article 29 : Cultural and Educational Rights : Article 29 (2) is controlled by the clause 4 of Article 15,

INCORPORATED in the Constitution by the First Amendment Act, 1951. This has brought Article 15 and 29 in line with Articles 16 (4), 46 and 340 and made it constitutional for the State to reserve seats for the backward classes of citizens, in public educational institutions. According to Article 29 a cultural or linguistic minority has a right to conserve its language or culture. This article provides protection to Scheduled Tribe communities to preserve their languages, dialects and cultures. The State would not by law enforce upon it any other culture or language.

Article 46 : Promotion of Educational and Economic Interests of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other Weaker Sections :

#### Article 164 : Minister Incharge of Tribal Welfare in the states of Bihar, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh :

THIS Article provides for a Minister incharge of tribal welfare in the states of Bihar, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. These states have substantial tribal populations and special provision of a Minister looking after tribal welfare is an evidence of the concern of the framers of the Constitution for safeguarding the interests of Scheduled Tribes.

#### Article 330,332 and 334: Reservation in the Lok Sahba and the Vidhana Sabhas.

## Article 335 : Limits of Reservation.

### Article 338 : Special Officer:

THERE shall be a special officer for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to be appointed by the President. It shall be the duty of the Special Officer to investigate all matters relating to the safeguards provided for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under the Constitution. He shall report to the President upon the working of these safeguards at such intervals as the President may direct. The President shall call all such reports to be laid before each house of Parliament. Such an officer has been designated as Commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

BY VIRTUE of the Constitution (Sixty-Fifth Amendment) Act, 1990, the post of 'Special Officer' has been substituted by the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The

Commission shall consist of a chairperson, vice-chairperson and five other members to be appointed by the President. The Commission shall have the power to regulate if s own procedure. (The duty of the Commission and other matters have been dealt with in detail in the chapter on Administration and Institutional Setup alongwith the details regarding the former \*Special Officer' i.e., 'Commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes' for the readers to compare diese and understand some shifts and departures from the past).

Through, another amendment to the Constitution (89\* amendment in 2003), National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was bifurcated into two Commissions and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) was established.

## Article 339(1): Appointment of a Ck>mmission:

THE President may, at any time and shall, at the expiration of 10 years from the commencement of the Constitution, by order appoint a commission to report on the administration of Scheduled Areas and the welfare of the Scheduled Tribes in the States. Such commission, namely Scheduled Areas and'^heduled Tribes Commission, was appointed on 28th April, 1960 and it submitted its report in October 1961. It was headed by late Shri U.N. Dheber and it is popularly known as Dheber Commission.

The second such Commission was appointed by the President on 18\* July, 2002 under the chairmanship of Sri Dilip Singh Bhuria (now Known as Bhuria Commission) which submitted its report in 3 volumes on 16 July, 2004.

### PlTovision Meant For The Economic Development Article 275 and 339 :

PROVISIONS relating to economic development of Scheduled Tribes mainly contained in Articles 275 and 339. Article 275 of the Constitution provides for assistance of the States for the implementation of the provisions of the Constitution. Article 339 lays down that the 'executive power of the Union government extends to the giving of directions to a state as to the drawing up and execution of schemes specified in the direction to be essential for the welfare of the Scheduled Tribes in the state." are

### Fifth And Sixth Schedule:

ARTICLES 244 and 244(A) under Part-X of the Constitution provide for administration of Scheduled Areas and Tribal Areas. Under the Constitution the terms Scheduled Areas and Tribal Areas have definite connotations. The Scheduled Areas are governed by the provisions contained in the Fifth Schedule and the areas thus covered may also be called the Fifth Scheduled Areas. The Tribal Areas are governed by the provisions of the Sixth Schedule.

### Fifth Schedule:

THE Scheduled Areas and their administration fall under the Fifth Schedule. Here, it means such areas as the President may, by order, declare to be Scheduled Areas. The Parliament is empowered to make any amendment in the Schedule and it shall not be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purpose of Article 368.

THE history of the Scheduled Areas may be traced back to 'The Scheduled District Act, 1874" which provided for the appointment of special officers to administer civil and criminal justice, to superintend the settlement and collection of public revenue and matters relating to rent and otherwise, to conduct the administration within the Scheduled Districts. Passing through "Government of India Act, 1910", Government of India Act, 1935" (Excluded and Partially Excluded Areas Act) it is under the present Constitution known as Fifth Schedule.

THE Scheduled Areas have been constituted with the clear objectives to (a) assist the tribals in enjoying their existing rights without any hindrance by others and (b) to develop the Scheduled Areas and protect and promote the interest of the Scheduled Tribes.

UNDER the Presidential order certain tribal areas have been declared as Scheduled Areas in the state of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh. The main features of the Fifth Schedule are the (1) special legislative powers of the Governor (b) Governor's Report to the President and (c) Constitution of a Tribes Advisory Council.

### Sixth Schedule:

THE Sixth Schedule applies to Tribal Areas within the States of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura. Among the main features of the Tribal Areas are (a) their full autonomy in respect of matters

falling within their jurisdiction. In other words these areas may be described as 'states within a state', (b) power of self management to the tribals through autonomous district and autonomous regions and (c) autonomy of these areas to such an extent that the Amt of the Parliament or the state legislature does not run automatically unless the Acts in whole or part are specifically extended^to^the Tribal Areas by notification of the Governor.

THERE are nine autonomous districts in Tribal Areas of the four states mentioned above. The Governor enjoys unique position vis-adistricts. In several respects his position may be equated to that of the President's in relation to states. vis autonomous

#### 432\_TRIBAL INDIA

AFTER going through this summarised narration of the Constitutional provisions for the Scheduled Tribes one may visualise a very rosy picture of the state of affairs. Sadly the lofty ideas of the framers of the Constitution could never be translated into reality. The plight of the tribal people during the last four decades after independence as portrayed honestly in the pages of this book bear testimony to this bitter reality.
