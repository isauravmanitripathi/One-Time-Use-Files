WHEN we talk of the role of non-tribal agencies in tribal welfare, we start with the work of Christian missionaries and stop at enumerating the names of the present day voluntary social oiganizations. In this way we tend to foiget the role of thousands of rishis, sanyasis and ascetics who were probably the first people from the civilized world to live amidst the tribals for any considerable period of time and first to do something for their upliftment. Saints and seers veiy often went to forests to^njo>^the^pleasures^f-natureand practice austerity for the attainment of salvation. They were quite numerous and some of them lived in the caves of the Himalayas or the Vindhays till their death. They were kind and gentle to the animals and we may be pretty sure that they were equally kind and gentle to the ancestors of the tribal people of today amongst whom they lived. It is because of this that the Gonds of Central India, the tribes of Arunachal Pradesh or Ladakh or any other part of the Himalayas remember those saints and seers with great affection. There are folk songs and folktales about them. "Tliese saints specially gave them medicines and attended to them whenever they suffered. We have, therefore, the traditions of Sabri and Ekiavya of the medieval age" G^arayanjee, 1968). Dhebar Commission's Report (1960-61) also supports this assertion and adds that though at that time there was no idea of catering to their physical and material needs and no programmes of social welfare, but these sanyasis and others carried with them an atmosphere of peace and love which even now is one of the greatest gifts that we can give to people anywhere.

### CHRISTIANITY as an Agency of Welfare

IT WERE the Christian missionaries of the western countries who first brought to the tribal people of India, their welfare programmes. K. N. Sahay (1968) veiy aptly remarks that of the various agencies responsible for changing the cultural canvas of Indian tribals as well as other such downtrodden communities, Christian missionaries would perhaps claim to be the oldest, having further set an example of high spirited social service and reforms which was later followed by many others. They were pioneers in the educational programmes

and they opened the first hospitals in the tribal areas Also, they were among the first to inspire the tribal people with the idea of progress and to awaken them to a sense of their rights.

WHENEVER and wherever the Christian missionaries have gone for evangelization, it has been supported by various welfere schemes for the converts such as opening of schools, dispensaries, hospitals, orphanages, vocational centres and other measures for eradicating miseries and providing material comforts to these people. Central Indian tribes and the tribes of north-eastern region have been centres of activities of these missionaries. Apart from providing educational and health facilities throughout the length and breadth of tribal India, various missionary organizations did pioneering work in the field of economic programmes. For example, the credit goes to the Catholic missionaries of Chotanagpur region for starting the cooperative credit societies in the region. Various missionary institutions dealing with agricultural programmes taught the tribals modern means of agriculture. Through a series of vocational training centres, the tribals were trained to earn more through subsidiary occupations.

BRIEFLY speaking, Christianity has been responsible for introducing a number of welfare measures among the so far neglected and exploited tribal communities of India, and thus improving their social and economic conditions. As Sahay (ibid) puts it, such welfare activities of the Christian missionaries, popularly known as 'the work of mercy', are considered an inseparable part of the evangelization and they must be carried together though this approach of the missionaries has attracted criticisms from different sections of the non-Christian mass.

M.N. SRINIVAS (1962), while dwelling upon the problem of Indian unity, touches this issue by saying that "the idea that it is the paramount duty of the believers in the one true religion to convert outsiders to their faith, seems natural to the proselytising religions but it appears as intellectual and moral aggression to Hindus. This is specially so when the people who are converted are desperately poor and illiterate. The opening of schools, hospitals and other welfare agencies by missionaries in areas where Harijans and the tribals live, appears to the Hindus as only baits in the trap of conversion. The linking up of humanitarianism with proselytization has made the former suspect. Even very liberal, westernized Hindus feel this way".

THE insistence on proselytizing has, unfortunately, vitiated the value of their work in the eyes of many. As Dhebar Commission's Report puts it, at many places the effect of their teaching has been to break

up families and divide villages. One may see a village, which at one time worked and lived as a single uniL now split into a Christian hamlet and a non-Christian hamlet. There are villages where no fewer than five different Missions have been carrying on propaganda, opening separate schools and teaching different forms of Christianity. Also, the attitude of some missionaries has been completely negative and destructive. To them everything which is not Christian is "heathen" and some of the finest aspects of tribal life have been ab^doned in the process. The tribals have been taught to despise their past and as a result a strong inferiority complex has been created. To be fair, however, it is not only they, who have been guilty of causing confusion and deterioration of tribal culture. Some social workers and other non-official agencies as well as narrow-minded government officials have also tended to make the tribals despise their past and look down on their own culture.

HOWEVER, despite some weaknesses, Christianity has been a powerful agency of tribal welfare in India, It is a pleasure to see some of their schools, hospitals and vocational training centres being in isolated and geographically hostile areas. From the point of view of simplicity, economy and efficiency, the other social agencies have a lot to learn from them. It is a tribute to their devotion and selfsacrifice in the remotest hills and forests that when we wish to speak of an ideal social worker, we say that he has missionaiy spirit. run

## Social Workers and Other Voluntary Institutions

INDIA has an old tradition of selfless social work and voluntary social oiganizations are not a new phenomenon. As far back as 1871, Bhil Seva Mandal was formed in Gujarat and an ashram at Miraknedi in Panchmahal district was established to work among the Bhil and Rani Parej. A. V. Thakkar, popularly known as Thakkar Bapa, the moving spirit behind this oiganization. Later on, he emerged the greatest worker in tribal welfare in modem times. Before India attained independence, he had established twenty one such institutions in various parts of the counhy. There was a magic in his personality. He could create workers, attract workers and hold on to the workers. The histoiy of three decades of dogged endeavour the part of this singularity quiet and dedicated yet principled personality is a romance of social work in India. In 1948, he alongwith Dr. Rajendra Prashad, our first President, founded the Bhartiya Adimajati Sevak Sangh. Its objective is "the development was as on

of the tribal communities in India socially, economically, culturally and educationally, with a view to enable them to take their legitimate place in the national life of the country as equal citizens". This apex institution has been mostly concerned with the coordination of activities of various affiliated and recognized institutions. As the Dhebar Commission's Report puts it, it has played no small part in helping government shape its tribal welfare policy at the stage of preparation of the Constitution and therefore the plans and development. This apex institution has today behind it as affiliated or recognized institutions over hundred bodies throughout the country. These institutions have been directing their energies towards the economic progress and educational development of the tribes. Such pioneering commendable work as Forest Labourers Cooperatives in Gujarat and Maharashtra is a tribute to the dedication of this oiganization.

THE other voluntary agencies meriting special mention are the Servants of India Society and the Ramakrishna Mission. In recent years, they have bean working for the promotion of welfare of the tribals at the state and national levels. Their activities relate to education, medical relief, cooperation and occasionally to local self government. The Ramakrishna Mission has most of its branches in Assam, Bihar and West Bengal. Its institutions are maintaining successfully their traditions of service with special emphasis on character building and are free from all taints of proselytisation.

SOME other important non-official agencies, which include tribal welfare in their programmes are : Sarva Seva Sangh, Gandhi Smarak Nidhi, Kasturba Smarak Nidhi, Adimajati Seva Mandal, Ashok Ashram, the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Bhartiya Lok Kala Mandir, etc.

MOST of the non-official agencies have been working mainly in the fields of education and public health but gradually, they are extending their work to include tribal development blocks, cooperation, forest, trade and industry, cottage and village industries, cooperative farming, animal husbandry, panchayat work, cultural activities, prohibition and legal assistance, etc.

TO ENABLE them to expand their activities amongst the tribal population, the Central Government has been giving grants-in-aid to such organizations as are of all-India character; the State government give grants-in-aid to the organizations functioning in their respective states.

THE importance of enlisting the support of non-official oiganizations in promoting welfare of the tribal communities has generally been recognized. As members of advisory committees in states, their representatives are consulted in the formulation and implementation of tribal development programmes.

THE Shilu Ao Committee has noticed a tendency on the part of voluntary agencies to restrict their sphere of operations to the developed tribal areas. This has resulted, in some cases, in an overlapping of activities by a number of voluntary organizations operating m the same area. Further, the voluntary organizations should be encouraged to build up cadres of trained and devoted workers who will take up service in the cause of tribal welfare as a career. The BhartiyaAdimajati Sevak Sangh is now receiving financial assistance from the Centre for building up a dependable cadre of life workers for selfless service among the tribal communities on the lines of the Servants ofIndia Society and Servants of the People Society. more

IT IS necessary in any democratic framework that a measure of the constructive activity on the national level should be done under nonofficial auspices. These activities satisfy the urge of the normal human being to be of some use to the community in his spare time and give the benefit of his special abilities to those who are in need of them. Further, "the best administrative machinery of even a highly responsible and responsive democratic government, by its very nature, is bound to be impersonal in character and a non-official organization can more easily provide the personal touch" (Dhebar Commission). Through this personal touch these organizations can harness the latent energies of the masses into useful channels for their development.
