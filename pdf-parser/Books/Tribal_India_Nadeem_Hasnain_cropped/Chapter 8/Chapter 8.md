#### 96 TRIBAL INDIA

RELIGION is said to be the human response to the apprehension of something, or power, which is supernatural and supra-sensory. It had been regarded as a product of civilization until Tylor convincingly proved that "primitive" societies have their own versions of religious activity, not very different from that of civilized societies. Ever since Tylor's views were published in the late nineteenth century, no ethnographer has reported any primitive society without religious beliefs and practices.

TRIBALS India presents a colourful panorama of religious faiths and practices which is the manifestation of adjustments with their cultural, ecological conditions. Till late forties, tribal religions in India were termed as animism in various Census reports and literatures. "By animism was implied that exceedingly crude form of religion in which magic is the predominent element. It conceives of man as passing through a life surrounded by the ghostly company of powers and elements, mostly impersonal in their character. Some of these are regarded as presiding forces' over various 'departments' of life, each 'force' having its sphere of influence. Thus, there may be a spirit presiding over various diseases, spirits dwelling in rocks, rivers and waterfalls and so on. These are diligently propitiated to ward off the dangers associated with their influence" (Majumdar and Madan, 1967).

SPIRITS dwell everywhere and men have to be at peace with them to enjoy freedom from illness and a long life. If anybody falls ill the general belief is that some relationship has been violated. The and women skilled in the art of magic and sorcery decide what should be done for the sufferer. Among more sophisticated communities, certain places, probably enclosed by a wall and covered by a roof, are marked off as specially sacred. But among the animistic tribes all places are holy as they are the seats of spirits. men

AMONG the Korwas there is a spirit presiding over crops, one over ramfall, one over cattle. Besides, there are several spirits which dictate the attitude of the Korwas towards their neighbours, priests, headmen, etc. Animism carries with it a belief in benevolent as well as malevolent spirits which are supposed to influence the destiny of

man. The benevolent ones generally go unattended, as no one is afraid of them. Thus, for instance, the great sun god, Singbonga, of the Munda tribe is seldom worshipped as he is benign and does not harm anyone. This is a typical hallmark of primitive religions; they are more concerned with all forces, fears and frustrations. But it will not be fair to accuse those people of living in perpetual fear of ghosts and spirits. All men have their hopes and fears and to single out a few elements of tribal religions and say that the latter are bom only of fear is doing injustice to them.

THE tribes of Chhotanagpur like Munda, Oraon and Ho believe in a supernatural power known in their local dialect as bonga. Among the Ho the bonga are vaguely understood as powers indefinite and impersonal and they do not seem to have any objective appearance existence. "The overall supremacy of the bonga over Munda life shows only the extent of anthropomorphism. The impersonal bonga uses the medium of dreams to foretell, day dreams being used for fore-warning about bad things. Bonga is the manifestation of a vague supernatural power, one that is the cause of all energy. The bicycle has, of late, become a bonga, the powerful steam engine is a bonga, and the aeroplane is a greater bonga than any of the above" (Majumdar). Differences of power, prestige and so on among individuals are regarded to be due to the degree of the bonga power possessed by a person. or

THERE is hardly any tribe in India which does not believe in the conversion of soul of the deceased into a potential spiritual force. It is believed that these souls continue to remain in contact with the intimate relatives. Ancestor worship among them seems to be the logical result of such beliefs. The Todas of Nilgiri Hills and the Hos of Chhotanagpur perform two types of ceremonies after cremation. The second one is meant to make it sure that the departure of the soul from the body is final and forever. The Todas, while returning from the second such ceremony, scatter thorns so that the malevolent soul may not enter their village.

MOST of the tribes of India believe that life does not end with death, and that it continues to be present in one form or the other. Propitiation and worship of the souls of ancestors seems to be the result of such beliefs. The tribes of middle India believe that the souls of their ancestors come to their rescue in diseases to ward off other evil spirits. The tribal people of Chhattisgarh invoke the spirits of their ancestors through special ceremonies.

IT IS also believed by many tribes that certain objects are 'possessed\* by some spiritual powers and thus a sort of festishism appears to be the guiding principle among such tribes. Worship of such objects contains an element of magic which is further extended to the beliefs and practices of religio-magical nature. The Bondas of Orissa worship a particular sword in the belief that is connects them with the mightly Rajput warriors of yesteiyears. On a special occasion Bondo people assemble near a banyan tree and the sword is hidden in the thick foliage. After performing certain rituals, the priest climbs up the tree and comes down holding the sword in his right hand. Now a goat and a cock are sacrificed with this sword and the blood is thoroughly smeared on the sword. The frenzied devotees compete with one another to obtain some blood dropping from the sword. Those who obtain the blood smear it on the forehead. The priest, amidst chant of hymns, invokes the spirit to work for the devotees. Afterwards the sword is hidden in the foliage of the tree till further ceremonies. The Murias of Bastar possess a big drum in each village and believe that this is the abode of their chief deity lingopan who takes care of their well-being.

## Hinduism, Christianity and the Tribal Gods

REVIEWING the relationship between tribal religions and the wider Hinduism, Majumdar veiy rightly comments that though "it is true that the association of tribal religions in India with animism exists, it is not the whole truth. It was left to Hutton to reclaim these religions from the 'wastepaper baskets\* of animism. He found it difficult, on the basis of evidence from all over India, to draw a sharp line of distinction between Hinduism and tribal religions. Not that the two were not regarded as different by him but that he found that the two fuse and grade into each other. He is the author of the aptly famous statement to the effect that the tribal religions represent a kind of surplus material which has not yet been built into the temple of Hinduism. He finds this material veiy similar to the material already used in building up post-Vedic Hinduism.\*'

ELWIN also has, in his various monographs, pointed out the futility of distinguishing between tribal religions and Hinduism. He further points out that tribal people are always willing to worship a few more gods if by doing so they can enjoy some material or social advantages. This is evident from their contacts with Hindus and Christian missionaries.

CONTACT with non-tribals has been proved instrumental in changing the religious beliefs of many a tribal group. In certain cases these contacts have given a fresh lease of life to a tribal group by providing it with better tools of adaptation. As N. K. Bose (1971) points out, Christianity has undoubtedly brought the message of a richer life, a wider companionship and a new sense of dignity to converts. But it is interesting that the Christian religion has always been attended by the belief of modem western civilization. And this was particularly so during the British rule when the converts felt closer to the British rulers than to their 'benighted\* countiymen. It is only after independence that allegiance to one's native culture is being encouraged. It is now gaining acceptance that there can be a Christian religion which does not necessarily draw men and women away from their own culture and civilization. Yet, upto now, the principal agent of westernization, often regarded as modernization, among the tribal folks has been Christian missionary enterprise.

THE tribes of Chhotanagpur and Jharkhand region stretching upto Orissa and West Bengal, and of the north eastern region are the best examples of the result of contacts with Hinduism and Christianit)'. The relation of tribal folk to Hinduism or Christianity has been different because Hinduism has not been a proselytizing religion and secondly most of the tribes of India except those in north eastern region have been profoundly affected by Hinduism. While Hinduism has been unobstrusively making an impact on tribal life and culture, Christianity began making deep dents in it from the nineteenth century. Contacts with the Hindus led to the gradual adoption of popular Hindus deities, festivals and religious beliefs. This did not involve any significant break with the past. The tribals adopted these without giving up their own deities and gods. As mentioned earlier in this chapter the tribals willingly adopted and worshipped a few more gods. But this was not so in the case of Christianity. It meant total break with the past. The Christian priests and missionaries assured them that their (tribals) gods were blasphemous and obscene. Sometimes, it led to disintegration of stheir lives.

AS A result of culture contacts with the Hindus, the worship of Mahadeo in various forms is found not only among the Oraons but also among Gonds. Worship of Kali and Lakshmi is also common among many tribes. The growth of Bhagat cults such as Vishnu Bhagat, Tana Bhagat, etc., among the tribes of Chhotanagpur is also directly related to cultural contacts with the Hindus. It is also

## 100\_TRIBAL INDIA

interesting that many tribes tend to give up or.atleast claim to give up such practices as are not acceptable to their Hindu neighbours so as to raise themselves in their esteem.

THE impact of the Christian mission, however, is different. Acknowledging its impact, Sachidanand (1964) says that all over the world, the Church has been one of the most important agencies of social change. The religion of any primitive people inevitably reflects the social structure of the community in which it develops. Same is the case with Indian tribes and here lies the basic contradiction. Christianity reflects another type of social system in which geneological relationship is not so important. The Church asserts universality. A basis is provided for broadening the concept of brotherhood in which not only kith and kin but strangers are included as co-religionists. Christianity introduces a new kind of leadership and a new principle of social control. The priest becomes the all-round leader—the path finder, the friend, philosopher and guide. The importance of the traditional leader at once goes down. The concept of sin and the fear of retribution become powerful instruments of social control. This is accompanied by changes in material culture, outlook on life, worldview, etc. There is a change in dress, increased devotion to education, acceptance of the new system of medicine as well as loss of faith in magic and witchcraft. For political affiliation, the converts turn to the priest for guidance. Change of this nature may easily be discerned in Meghalaya, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland. It is also of immense importance that the impact of the mission is felt not only among the converts but also on those who come in contact with the Christians and are influenced by them by education, precept or example.

# HEAD HUNTING

THE very mention of \*head hunting\* induces many in India to think of Naga tribes of north-eastern region. However, it is a fact that the practice of head hunting has been widespread in many regions of the world. 'Head hunting\* refers to the practice of severing or slashing a head and keeping it as souvenir for a variety of purposes. Till the last century this practice has been prevalent among many primitive societies of the world including some of the Naga tribes of the north-eastern region of India. However, with the advent of the present centuiy especially during the last fifty years or so, head hunting has become a thing of the past with the erstwhile 'head hunters\* resorting to it in exceptional circumstances.

## TRIBAL INDIA\_ 101

THE head hunters believed that the soul and all the extra ordinary powers of the hunted person become sub irdinate of the hunter and he becomes more powerful. It also served as a means of status elevation in the society. It was also believed that head hunting brought good fortune, fertility and increased productivity in crops. Beside serving as a marker of muscular powers, head hunting was also believed to contribute for more reproductive power. Among the Nagas expertise in head hunting was considered ari added qualification for an eligible bachelor. Displaying the severed heads on bamboo poles as talisman, especially of the aged women, was the usual practice among the primitive Melanesians for obtaining better crops. Among all the head hunting groups the usual modus operand! has been to ambush the victim, usually of enemy groups, with utmost expertise. Heads of women were always more coveted because they were more guarded and hence their head hunting signified more valour on the part of the hunter. As far as the Naga tribes are concerned head hunting is no more prevalent. The British rulers dealt with it with iron hands and late on the government of independent India too made a multipronged attack on this custom through various socio-political and administrative means. The result of all these efforts is that except in very rare circumstances head hunting has become a thing of the past.

# SHAMANISM

SHAMANISM and Shaman are widely distributed phenomena among the tribal and non-tribal peasant communities in the world. Shamanism include those rituals and beliefs which are based on the principle that certain spirits enter into certain men who become 'possessed' and in turn are dictated by those spirits in performing various types of acts and rituals. Such people as the ones described above are popularly known as 'shaman'. Terms like 'Ojha' are also quite prevalent among a number of communities in India. Shamans are endowed by superhuman powers. They may be both benevolent as well as malevolent but more frequently they exist in benevolence.

AMONG most of the societies maintaining the Institution of Shamanism, the Shamans act as 'faith healers' or Yolk doctors'. However, they may also engage themselves in sorcery and witchcraft. In the former role they perform rituals and prescribe folk medicine to the affected people. If the practitioners of folk medicine are not able to deliver good, the Shaman steps in, communicate with the spirits and suggests propitiation of spirits as remedial measure.

THIS may include havan, sacrifice of animals or any strange "bizarre' rituals. Many tribes of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal have a strong Institution of Shamanism. The tribal communities specially primitive tribal communities feel very insecured because of uncertainties of the world around them. The fear of epidemic, natural disasters, inter group warfare, sorcery and witchcraft sustain Shamanism. or
