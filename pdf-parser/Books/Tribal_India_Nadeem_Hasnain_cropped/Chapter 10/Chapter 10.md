### (a) The Toda

WHENEVER one comes across the name of Toda one's mind flashes back to a very significant mode of matrimony. The Todas are known as a classic example of polyandiy. They have been a subject of interest since the early seventeenth century when they were first visited by a Portuguese missionaiy in 1602 A.D. Most of them inhabit the Nilgiri Hills of South India which fall under Ootacamund and Kunoor districts of Tamil Nadu while the remaining inhabit the contagious Kollegal taluk of South Kanara district of the State of Karnataka. The Nilgiris are an undulating plateau of about 478 square miles in area and 3000 to 8000 feet above the mean sea level. The Todas are probably the most extensively studied tribe of India which has been engaging the attention of anthropologists and other social scientists for more than a century. Apart from polyandiy they are also famous for their pastoral economy which they have raised to the level of a cult-the-cult of buffalo worshipping.

THEY call themselves as Tora and are known to their neighbours as the same. Among their closest neighbours are four other primitive tribes the Badaga, the Kota, the Kurumba and the Irula. According to the local social hierarchy the Todas share the highest social status with the Badagas followed by the Kotas, the Kurumbas and the Irulas. These four tribes play significant roles in the economic life of the Todas who maintain a high degree of interaction especially with the Badagas and the Kotas.

THE Nilgiris - their principal area of habitation are very rich in flora and fauna. The important wild animals include elephant, tiger, leopard, sambhur, bison, pigs and wild dogs. It's forests are also replete with white cedar, satinwood, rose wood, ebony, silver oak, eucalyptus and a host of other varieties of important trees.

THE Todas have their dialect but no script of their own. It exhibits similarities with Tamil language but the presence of some archaic words in it suggest some sort of previous connection of the Todas with the Brahuis of Baluchistan. The word Toda has possibly been derived from the word tudra which is the sacred tree of the Todas.

To their neighbouring Badagas a Toda is he who worships the tode tree.

THEIR light skinned complexion, tall stature, high and narrow nose, brown eyes, long beards and abundant body hair put them on a separate pedestal-strangers and misfits amidst the surrounding dark skinned Dravidian population. The males bear an athletic and robust physique while the females sport quite pretty and dignified appearance. Their racial affinities are still a matter of debate among the anthropologists and others. Some hold the view that they are a group of proto-Aryans who share a series of similar physical characteristics with the Ainus of Japan while others believe that they are Indo-Afghans or Nordics. The bewildering variety of opinions is enough to indicate the confusion regarding their racial composition and affinities and same is the case with their origin which is still shrouded in mystery.

Settlement Pattern and Housing: A Toda village usually consists of about six huts meant for individual families. It is mostly located at a slight elevation near a wood and a stream. A typical Toda hut is semi-barrel in shape with the barrel being split longitudinally. It usually consists of a big room with provision of several beds. Bamboo and thatch are the basic material used in the construction of these huts. The entrance of these huts is usually so low and narrow that one has to literally crawl while entering. A strict division is seen in the huts where the place meant for preparing milk produce is strictly earmarked from the rest of the place.

Social Organization: The Todas are strictly divided into two divisions or moieties called Taratharal and Teivaliol, thus possessing a dual oiganization. These moieties are strictly endogamous meaning they marry in their respective moieties like the castes but some irregular unions are allowed. Interestingly all the sacred herds and dairies are owned by the Tarthar while the Teivali only tend the herds, so the Tarthar occupy a higher status in the social hierarchy. These two moieties are further divided into several clans. The clans are endogamous. Each clan is territorial in nature and possesses a number of villages and is named after the chief of these villages. All the villages of a clan are usually located in the same part of the hill. Members of a clan are free to move over from one village to another in search of greener pastures or to perform certain ceremonial obligations. Thus, clans among the Todas have some social arid ritual significance.

THESE clans are divided into families locally known as Kudupeli. Since fraternal polyandry is the most popular mode of marriage among the Todas, a typical Toda family consists of brothers, their common wife or wives and their married and unmarried sons and unmarried daughters. The authority lies with the eldest male of the family. The division of labour in the family is not evenly balanced. While the adult male members do the herding, milking, churning, fuel gathering, cooking, trading and a host of other tasks the females perform minor domestic chores like fetching water, embriodering clothes, pounding and sifting grains, sweeping the floor, cleaning utensils and some other less significant tasks. The above disparity being not enough, the males also control all the political, religious and ceremonial activities thus further enhancing their role in the life of the tribe. Such a set up has given rise to a situation where women have been assigned an inferior status as compared to males.

THE females have been made to believe that their inferior status is directly proportional to their negligible role in the economy of the tribe. However, they are not treated with contempt or cruelty. But honestly speaking it is just the over-simplification of the situation. It certainly goes back to the days when female infanticide was in vogue. Fortunately enough, this nefarious and cruel practice has almost stopped and the status of women is also climbing up the ladder of respectability.

ALTHOUGH they are still not allowed to meddle in the preparation of any milk produce but in many cases they have taken up the responsibility of cooking other food. The very notion of ritual pollution imposed upon women is also loosening and the long suppressed ^untouchables' of the Toda society are gradually gaining respectability and acceptance in a variety of socio-economic spheres.

THE most popular form of marriage among the Todas is still fraternal polyandry though monogamy and polygamy are also not uncommon. They have adopted polyandry in such a way that there is hardly any jealousy among the husbands on the issue of the common wife. Significantly, it is the eldest brother who actually marries and the rest become husbands by the force of custom. If the brothers decide to marry another girl the actual bridegroom still remains the same. However, when the husbands are not brothers (that is, in case of non-fratemal polyandry which is also permitted) but clan brothers even then the eldest of them marries the girl and the common wife adopting the role of 'visiting wife' keeps on visiting every husband. Such visits usually stretch to a month or so.

UNLIKE the majority of Indian tribes, the Todas practice child marriage. Sometimes, their marriage is performed at the age of two or three. In these circumstances, the parents of the nascent bride and bridegroom settle the marriage and the bride remains at her parents' house till she attains puberty. A custom reported by earlier researchers but not easily verifiable today is quite important in this context especially when we analyse the status of women in the Toda society. It pertains to the initiation of the bride into sex life before she actually attains puberty and sent to her husband's house. It has been reported that just before the bride attains puberty a ceremony is held in which a young man of some other clan is invited to violate the 'chastity' of the bride. Now sometime later her groom comes with clothes and jewellary and takes away the bride to his house. Such practices may be taken as a strong testimony to the fact that through such customs women are made to believe that they are nothing but merely a chattel or commodity which can be used by its owner in any manner he likes. The custom of transferring wife from one man to another, with or without her consent, may be yet another proof in support of this statement. Under such circumstances of sexual permissiveness, extra-marital sex relations are also permitted. Moreover, the sacred dairymen have socially sanctioned right to enjoy sex with any woman they desire. Provoked by such a permissive attitude some scholars have remarked that the Todas live in a condition of 'promiscuity' or free sex and their world view is devoid of any notion of chastity or adultery.

THE Todas trace their descent through father but biological fatherhood does not carry much significance among them because of polyandry where it is almost impossible to know the actual father. Thus, they have evolved a ceremony known as 'bow and arrow ceremony' through which sociological fatherhood is ushered. During the seventh month of pregnancy any of the common husbands with common consent presents the wife with a bow and arrow in an elaborate ceremony and it is this husband who is regarded as father of not only the expected child but all children to come until some other husband, of course with common consent, presents another bow and arrow in the same way. Significantly the Toda children are considered children of the whole clan and not of a particular man. Also significant is the fact that all the husbands, who are not necessarily brothers, treat the children with the same affection and care and nobody bothers himself with the mystery of biological fatherhood. The bow and arrow ceremony still carries so much

social and ritual force that it is shameful for a women to deliver a baby without undergoing this ceremony.

DIVORCE is freely permitted among the Todas and it does not cany any stigma. The ground of divorce is usually laziness or foolishness and not barrenness or adultery like many other tribes. If a man divorces his wife he has to pay a fine of one buffalo to his wife's parents and is entitled to get in return any number of buffaloes he has given as funeral contributions from time to time.

THE Todas system of reckoning kins is of classificatory type. For example the term Tather' includes not only ones' physiological or legal fathers but also ones' paternal uncles, husbands of ones' maternal aunts and all other males of fathers' clan and generation. Similar is the case with the mother. Such a kinship system is well reflected during seyeral eventualities like death when all such kins are supposed to contribute towards funeral of the deceased. It is prohibited among the Todas to pronounce the names of father-inlaw and mother-in-law and it is customaiy for everyone to pay respect to father-in-law and other males of his status in a particular way. One has to prostrate and touch the feet of such male kins.

THE Todas have elaborate rules of property and inheritance. They recognize individual ownership as well as family and clan ownership of different kinds of property. Such movable items as dress, ornaments, household utensils and a host of other minor things belong to individuals. Ordinary and some of the sacred buffaloes are owned by individuals or families but the most sacred ones called UV belong to clans only. Among the immovable items, house and smaller villages are owned by the families while the land and the chief villages including the dairies are owned by the clans. The inheritance of property is followed along patrilineal lines which means that only sons inherit their fathers\* property. The legal or 'sociological sons' of a man either share their fathers' property in common or equally divide it among themselves. In such cases an extra buffaloes is given to the eldest and the youngest ones. When a man dies in debt, his liabilities are also distributed in the same way.

THEIR political oiganization is devoid of any tribal chief. Instead, the people are governed by a council of five elders locally known as "naim\ It has an interesting composition. Three of its members traditionally come from the Tarthar clans, one is taken from Teivali clans and the fifth one comes from the Badagas, the neighbouring tribe which has no independent existence of its own in isolation

from the Todas. This representative from the Badagas usually sits in cases involving the relations between the two tribes. Significantly the council enjoys hardly any power in criminal cases and it exercises its authority in civil disputes between individuals, families and clans. But interestingly it is not strong enough to assert itself fully even in its limited jurisdiction. It frequently succumbs to individual pressures and may be subdued with the help of bribery or intimidation. Besides this council the clans possess informal heads and each family has a head who is responsible for the collection of its share in clan's expenses.

THOUGH some Todas have converted to Christianity, the majority still adhers to their tribal religion which is marked by polytheism. They believe in an indefinitely large number of spirits, gods and godesses.

TWO of their most important deities are Teikirzi and On. The former being the supreme goddess rules the people on the earth. The latter is her younger brother who rules over the world of the dead. The remaining important deities are associated with different hill tops. There are also two river deities associated with the two chief rivers of the area. On the whole the dominant Toda religion is marked by elaborate rituals. The dairies are like temples for the Todas and the dairymen are like priests. But all the dairies are not equal in their veneration and their ritual importance varies. They also believe in divination and sorcery. They cremate their dead with elaborate rituals and fanfare in which offerings are made and buffaloes are sacrificed. Interestingly the flesh is not eaten but given away to others.

ECO-System and Economy: The Todas have not been quick to adapt themselves to their changing environment of predatory competition and exploitation by the new comers to the Nilgiris. Their whole economic life rotates round buffalo and they have renmined static or developed along their own line of social evolution embracing the all important buffalo. They practice neither agriculture, nor horticulture nor any craft. They also do not make use of such food gathering pursuits as hunting and fishing which are important pre-requisites of collectional economy. Interestingly they are vegetarian in their food habits and a little bit of food gathering which they occasionally indulge into is related to collection of some edible roots, fruits, and tubers as a supplement to their predominant milk diet.

BEFORE taking up the salient features of their pastoral economy let us take a look into another significant aspect of their life viz.

their intimate economic relationship with their neighbouring tribes. Apart from the Todas, the Badagas, the Kota, the Kurumba and the Irula are the other four tribes inhabiting the plateau. It is difficult to find any other tribal belt in the whole of India where a cluster of different tribes with such interdependence. Among all these tribes, the Kotas are one who live in a kind of symbiosis with the Todas. Traditionally, they are blacksmiths and musicians inhabiting seven villages interpersed among the Toda settlements and several Badaga villages. Although the Kotas have a definite vocational specialization yet interestingly their main source of livelihood is agriculture. They speak a dialect of their own which, however, is understood by the Todas. They traditionally serve the Todas, the Badagas and the Kurumbas. They supply iron tools and implements, wooden utentils and other articles of use. They also play music in rituals and ceremonies. In partial payment they receive the carcasses of the cattle and their flesh whenever they are sacrificed along with butter. They pay respect to the Todas and donate some grain to their pastoral neighbours as tribute. On ritual grounds they are not allowed to enter a Toda or Badaga house. The Todas consider their mere touch as polluting and a bath is required in such an eventuality. The Badaga are agriculturists and are mainly potato growers. They have been largely Hinduised and are highly ambitious and prosperous people. The Kurumba serve the Badaga as agricultural labour due to their inferior status in the local hierarchy. The Irula fall on the periphery of their social and economic life and hence do not play any significant role in this socio-economic symbiosis.

THE buffaloes constitute the economic as well as social backbone of the Todas. They have raised buffalo herding to the level of a cult. They subsist on the products of their buffaloes. On an average each household possesses eight to twelve buffaloes that belong to a finer variety than the common buffalo of India. Each buffalo is given a separate name and their pedigrees are carefully remembered. But all are not equal in sanctity. The ordinary buffaloes are taken care of by the boys and ordinary men and all the dairy operations as churning of milk etc. are performed in the house. But the sacred buffaloes kept in sanctified yards treated as sacred dairies and all the diary operations including preparation of various produce are performed in the dairy itself with elaborate rituals. The ritual status of diaiymen varies with the sanctity of buffaloes they tend to and take care of. are

AS ALREADY stated the dairy operations fall in 'all male domain' because females are considered by them as ritually impure, due to menstruation and other reasons, and are not supposed to touch the

buffaloes. In some cases the women are not allowed even to tread on the path used by the sacred buffaloes. Thus, the males completely dominate all the spheres of economic activities leaving the women high and dry with their inferior status. The dairymen have been elevated to the position of priests and they are admitted to this office only after an elaborate ordination.

THEY begin their day with the grazing of the buffaloes who are escorted by young males to the pastures. Just before dusk they are escorted back to their sacred quarters for milking operation. On the whole it may be said that they live buffalo, think buffalo and act buffalo which is omnipresent in all the spheres of their life.

THE elaborately made milk products are sold to the people of the plains usually through the Badagas who act as efficient middlemen. After retaining a part for personal consumption the rest is exchanged with neighbouring tribes for other articles of everyday life.

MILK products, vegetables and food grain constitute the staple diet of the Todas. Though, they are allowed to eat deer's flesh they usually avoid any non-vegetarian food including fish. Significantly, unlike many other Indian tribes who are addicted to alcohol, opium or other narcotics, the Todas have remained relatively free from such habits. If at all they are addicted to anything, they are certainly addicted to whey.

Problems and Prospects : The Todas have not been quick to adapt themselves to changing conditions. They have remained almost static or developed on their own line of the Badagas who came and settled in the Nilgiris much later advanced economically to the deterimenl of the Todas. But the foremost problem of the Todas is their steadily declining population. Partly on account of diseases, chiefly veneral diseases and partly on account of female infanticide coupled with their miserable economic condition. Veneral diseases are certainly' the gift from the early European and Indian tourists who had converted a great part of the Nilgiris into a summar health resort to escape the scorching sun. The Todas came across all sorts of tourists for the first time only during the British rule. Thanks to the dedicated work of certain medical agencies the rot has stopped and they can certainly look forward for a better tomorrow at least on their population front.

1\*HE Todas have traditionally been the lord of the land in the Wenlock ^ Downs near Ootacamund. This area comprised of about 18000 acres of land and it is reported that in 1822, the collector if Ootacamund

had to purchase land from the Todas for building the first bunglows. When European settlers started coming in increasing numbers and the vicious process of land alienation began, the government had to formulate what was called the Todapatta Land Policy' under which land was reserved for the Todas for pastoral purposes. With the advent of modem times when the land came under forest department, the Todas had a taste of the coming days of their diminishing authority over land. However, they were statutarily allowed to the forest produce and agriculture. The Todas having different frame of mind could not be weaned away from their buffaloes. Thus, the lands were leased to the Badagas while Todas became absentee landlords. The Todas continued to be given Patta (agricultural rights), renewable every year for cultivation but they did not fall in line. The demand of the Todas, however, is that they should be alloted these lands permanently. By virtue of their psychological attachment and deep rooted religious beliefs, the Todas would not like to leave the Wenlock Downs-their traditional abode and migrate to other areas. If they cannot be weaned away from cattle bearding to some other profitable ventures, the cattle herding itself may be made profitable and rewarding to these people with imaginative planning and purposeful assistance. use

### (b) THE CHENCHU

THE Chenchus represent that segment of tribal population of India whose economy does not seem to have changed in any significant manner for the last few thousand yeai-s. Concentrated in a small pocket situated in the heart of Andhra Pradesh, the Chenchus live on either side of the famous river Krishna with the Naliamalai forests on the southern side and the rugged and densely wooded plateau on the northern side. District wise, the majority of Chenchus arc scattered in Mehboobnagar, Kumool and Prakasham.

THEY are one of the laigest food gathering tribes belonging to the pre-agricultural level of living depending upon wild roots, tubers, fruits, honey, yam and small game. Carrying digging stick and bow and arrow they are clinging desperately to the outmoded food gathering economy. It is said that when the food gathering economy of southern India gave way to the food producing economy and tribal groups were transformed into village settlements. The majority of Chenchus faithfully resisted this change and finding themselves helpless against the onslaught of settled life, withdrew themselves from the mainstream of technological innovations and hid into the

depths of the forests. The remaining ones settled in peripheral villages and hence are distinctly different. They are mostly settled cultivators who have adopted the cultural pattern and economic pursuits of the neighbouring plains people.

THE Chenchus are medium statured and their complexion varies from wheatish to light brown. On the basis of their physical characteristics most of the anthropologists prefer to put them in the australoid racial stock but at the same time agree that they also contain some negrito strains. Though looking shy and fragile they demonstrate a high degree of physical endurance. They speak a corrupt dialect of Dravidian origin.

Settlement Pattern and Housing : Till recently the Chenchus had been leading a wholly nomadic life. They still carry the fond memories of those bygone days and this is reflected in their folklore. Linder certain economic compulsions they have given up their wholly nomadic life to a great extent and have started living in semi-permanent thatched huts. But this hardly means that they have downed the shutters of the past. They still keep on shifting their settlements after every couple of years. They make small conical thatched huts with the leaves touching the ground. These huts have such a small entrance that one has to stoop very low to enter it. Most of the Chenchu settlements contain two to fifteen houses with individual families occupying them. For a new settlement they prefer hill slopes or high ridges so that the enemies may be sighted from some distance and they have ample time to escape. Invariably, these settlements are located away from the water source to avoid wild animals who will also be coming to drink water from the same source. Their in-built defence mechanism has taught them to avoid the ferocious animals who cannot be tackled with a mere bow and arrow.

Social Organization : They are divided into exogamous clans with animal totems whose killing or eating are taboo for the members of the clan. Nuclear family containing the husband, wife and the unmarried children, is the most popular mode of family among them. In the mundane affairs of life husband and wife enjoy equal rights but in the scheme of ownership, except items of individual use, usually the husband owns all the property. This implies that authority and succession are patriarchal. Though, residence is partrilocal, matrilocal residence for a specified period is also not uncommon, especially immediately after marriage.

LIKE most of the other tribes child marriage is not popular among the Chenchus. In most of the cases the spouse is sought from outside one's own clan but among some selected ones life partner is usually selected from mother's clan and preference is given to mother's brother's daughter. This mode of matrimony is prevalent to such an extent that they have the same kinship term for maternal uncle and father-in-law. Though, marriage is an arranged affair among them yet care is taken to ascertain the wishes of the bride and groom before finalising; girls are also allowed to express their views freely on matrimonial affairs. The highly liberal attitude of the Chenchu towards their womenfolk is further reflected in the liberties the girls enjoy even before marriage. They are not captive birds. They freely mix up with the boys of those clans which may provide them life partner. In other words, courtship is quite popular especially during festive seasons when everybody enjoys life till the lease. But such affairs are not carried out publicly and a curtain of privacy is required in order not to hurt the feelings of the elders who may not react favourably if such affairs become public. Such relationship may result into sexual intimacy but every care is taken to camoflague it lest it should invite wrath from the elders. They maintain a 'reserved' posture in the matters of sex and avoid any discussion on sexual affairs and problems.

USUALLY the groom's side takes initiative in finalising marriage but the bride's side may also take first step. After it has been finalised, the biggest problem for the groom is to arrange a Saari and Choli for the bride and a Choli for his mother-in-law. Next comes the communal feast. These arrangements are enough to burden the groom economically to a considerable extent.

FRAGILITY of conjugal bonds presents lot of worries to the married couple. Family among them is unstable due to frequent divorce. A woman is free to choose her life partner with whom she lives at her will while the husband also enjoys these and frequently uses his customary right to send her wife back to her parents if he does not carry on well with her. In case the wife breaks the wedlock the husband may demand the amount of money back which he incurred on marriage. Traditionally, a divorced woman is not allowed to remarry another man in the life time of her former husband but interestingly she may live with any person of her choice without a formal marriage. Though the Chenchus are permitted to be polygynous yet the popular mode of martimony is still ,monogamy.

A VERY interesting and important feature of their kinship system is the deeply rooted suspicion of blood relatives especially brothers.

This is amply reflected during hunting expeditions or honey collection when they maintain a distance from their brothers and other blood relatives and tend to be closer to their affinal kins like brother-inlaw and prefer them for lending one a helping hand.

THE Chenchus have also evolved the institution of elderman. Every settlement has a traditional leader known as Peddamanshi but his hold on the community is quite loose and he cannot govern with a firm hand. He represents his village before the outsiders, settles minor disputes with the help of other elderly people, acts as priest and blesses the couple at the time of marriage. Though, his office is hereditary yet any elderly, knowledgeble and respiected male may be unanimously appointed to this office.

UNDER the Chenchu social organization only movable property may be owned individually. The immovable property like land, forests, trees etc. come under comunal ownership and every member of the community enjoys equal right over them. With the enactment of forest laws the complexion of the situation has considerably changed and now everybody has to follow them.

LIKE their simple economic life they have evolved a simple system of religious beliefs and practices. Although due to growing cultural contacts with the neighbouring Hindus of the plans, their religion, too, is undeiigoing changes, yet some of its features may still be distinguished. Bhairov is their most popular local deity to whom a small part of the hunted animal is offered but godess Garelamaisama still reigns supreme among that segment of Chenchus which still totally depends upon hunting and gathering for subsistence. She gives them strength and skill for success in hunting expeditions. On the whole, their religion is conspicuous by the absence of festivals and elaborate rituals.

TRADITIONALLY the Chenchus bury their dead but to growing Hiiidu influence those who reside amidst plains\* Hindus have started cremating their dep^ed ones.

ECO-system and Economy: The Chenchus depend mostly on what nature provides them. Their economic system is essentially that of a tribe of hunters and foodgatherers. On the top of it they have developed a psyche in which saving for future is alien to them and this has led to a carefree and hand-to-mouth existence.

THE changing seasons witness quick changes in a Chenchu's life. In one part of the year they go on digging out edible roots, in another collection of edible fruits is resorted to while in yet another

all the emphasis is laid on hunting and their life all the year round rotates round gathering and hunting.

AS A matter of routine a Chenchu wakes up in the morning with almost no food in the house and proceeds leisurely with his spouse to the forest to collect roots and fruits and consuming it at the time. After a couple of years when the warmth of conjugal ties cools down a little bit, males and females resort to segregation and males and females in small groups of 3-6 persons go out separately. same now

ALL available fruits and tamarind, mahua etc. constitute the staple vegetarian diet. With the onset of summer the bushes and leaves diy up and it becomes very difficult for them to trace the edible roots and tubers. Now they resort to hunting. Though their surrounding forests are quite rich in fauna where all sorts of small and big games are present but they are not good hunters. Hence, it becomes quite an uphill task for them to hunt according to their needs and requirements. They go out with their bows and arrows to hunt the birds, small games like hare, squirrel, black monkey etc. and when they spot their target like squirrel or monkey they chase it into the open by hurling sticks and stones until it comes within range of their arrows. When the animal has been hunted down a fire is made in the forest and after roasting the animal it is consumed right there with its skin on. It is rarely that some part is saved and brought home. They also use sharp pieces of stone, with amazing competence, as an important hunting weapon. Using them as missiles birds and squirrels are hunted down with much ease. The Indian monitor locally known as Udumu is also one of their favourite games who comes out of its hole usually in the rainy season in lai^e numbers only to fall prey to the waiting Chenchus who break its back with sticks and relish it as a delicacy.

SOME Chenchu groups who have developed a knack for domesticating a couple of animals also use dog in hunting. Their dependence on the mercy of nature may be gauged from the fact that they have no hesitation in eating even stale and highly decomposed flesh of animals found as left overs of wild dogs especially during days of scarcity. Some Chenchus have also started domestication of cattle like cow, buffalo and goat but they rarely stay with them for any long time due to their economic vulnerability. They are sold away for subsistence.

FISHING is also one of their modes of subsistence but it is restricted to a veiy small extent because only very few of their villages situated near rivers and str'eams. The traditional method of fishing is are

through poisoning and poisoning substance is prepared out of a powder produced from a local tree mixing it with sand and moth. But nowadays the Chenchus have started employing hook and rod techniques of fishing wherever possible.

HONEY constitutes an important item of their diet. They are very deft in handling honey combs hanging from trees and cliffs. When they get a honey comb they eat it entirely including the wax and the nascent bees. They have attained such an expertise in procuring honey that they do not have to search for the combs; they know where, when and how to find it.

THE budding season of Mahua brings such a gusto, happiness and ecstacy in their lives that they wait for it. Its flower dropping down are gathered eagerly all the year round. A great amount of it is eaten after boiling it and the remaining is used in brewing liquor. The much yearned and sought after mahua liquor tranforms their drab and monotonous existence into an orgy of marrymaking. This is the only time when they forget their miseries and hard struggle for existence and spend, much of their time in dancing and making love.

DESPITE a variety of food items their diet is nutritionally inadequate. It is ill balanced and lacks several essential nutrients. Infact only the intake of cereals during the summers and leaves during the rains is satisfactory to an extent. However, the consumption of oil, sugar, jaggery, vegetable and milk products is neglible. The net result of this ill balanced diet is that they are always deficient of Vitamin A and Calcium. Hence malnutrition is a rule rather than an exception.

Problems and Prospectus: They are yet to grow out of their food gathering stage and with the passage of time they are no more completely isolated and insulated either geographically or culturally. And this is the crux of the problem. Now the situation prevailing among them is that they can neither obtain their food completely from the forest due to depletion of forest resources and stringent laws, increase in the density of population, competition from the non-tribals, commercialisation of forests and unscruplous role of forest officials nor can completely switch over to the food of the neighbouring peasantry by taking up agriculture, animal husbandry or cottage industries. They are caught in a dilemma and are 'misfif in a fast changing society.

WITH the adoption of clothing arid growing requirement of better tools arid implements for food gathering and hunting the economic

pressure is mounting. Since they do not have cash they have to give something in exchange. Initially they offered such forest produce as honey, mahua, etc. With the growing demand they had to part with their cattle. Even this was not the end. Further growing demand and unscruplous dealing on the part of non-tribal traders pushed them into a situation when they were forced to offer their labour and quite a considerable number of Chenchus have forefeited their freedom and are working as beasts of burden for the contractors. Unfortunately, the psychic make up of the Chenchus is also responsible for this sorry state of affairs to a considerable extent. Their worldview is devoid of any vision of tomorrow. Curiously they always preferred a carefree and hand to mouth existence which was fully exploited by the technologically more advanced and unscruplous neighbours. Lack of cooperation is another factor responsible for their present state of affairs. Except taking care of an ailing relative or in construction of huts they seldom demonstrate a semblance of cooperation. They venture out in the forests for collection in groups but do the actual work individually and everybody prefers to fill up his own basket rather than doing the work collectively and dividing the fruits of labour on equal basis. Even during hunting expeditions they avoid taking each other's help. Such an attitude in the face of fast changing economic scenario only helped the impending disaster sooner and more severely than expected.

WITH the advent of independence a variety of programmes of tribal welfare and development have been initiated but nothing considerable could be done for the poor Chenchus. In view of the small size of population and scattered nature of their settlements no tribal development block could be started in their midst. After their identification as a primitive tribe new development schemes have been taken up. They have yet to show concrete results.

EVEN forest cooperative societies in their area did not survive for a longer period though a society named Chenchu Cooperative Society managed by the forest department still exists at least in name. As far back as 1940s attempts were made to lure them to settled life, agriculture, animal husbandry and cottage industries but the Chenchu lost almost all the lands through alienation and they returned back to forests. This shows that a more careful and imaginative planning is needed from the grassroot level, keeping firmly in mind their cultural ethos, world view and value system. It seems that their only hope lies in taking to agriculture for which they have not yet demonstrated any real taste or zeal.

## (c) THE KHASI

THE Khasi tribe holds the distinction of being one of the few remaining matriarchal tribes of the world. They are one of the most advanced tribal communities in India having an economy now diversified with substantial commerce, industry and urbanization. Educationally they are far a head of many non-tribal communities and they enjoy substantial representation in the higher All India Services. The erstwhile districts of the\United Khasi and Jaintia Hills of Assam - the traditional homeland of the Khasi - now falls under the nascent state of Meghalaya which became a full fleged state in 1972. Now an overwhelming majority of the state of Meghalaya consists of the Khasis, Garos and some minor tribes the Khasis being the numerically laigest and politically dominating tribal community in the state.

SOCIALLY the Khasis are divided into four main sub groups, viz., Khynrian Khasis or upland Khasis of the Shillong plateau of the Khasi hills, the Pnar of the Jaintia Hills - the War of the Western and Southern slopes of the district and the Bhoi of the lowlands. Besides these four divisions two other groups-the Hadem of Jaintia Hills and the Lynngam of the Khasi hills, have been recently recognised as Khasis. Since each of the above divisions of the Khasis observed territorial endogamy in the past they may be designated as sub-tribes.

THE erstwhile district of the United Khasi and Jaintia Hills - the homeland of the Khasi is 5541 sq. miles in area. It is bounded on the north by Brahmaputra Valley (Kamrup and Nowgong districts of Assam), on the east by the United Mikir and North Cachar Hill districts, on the south by Sylhet (now part of Bangladesh) and Cachar and on the west by the Garo Hills. The land of the Khasi consists of four plateaus rising abruptly above the low plains of Sylhet to a height of about 4000 feet above the mean sea level at Cherrapunji, the highest rainfall centre on the earth. Further towards the north at a higher level there is another plateau at Mawphlang where some of the villages are situated at an elevation of about 6000 feet above mean sea level. This happens to be the highest tract within the district. Shillong, the State Capital, is situated in this part.

THE whole area is characterised by the breath taking natural beauty. Some to the finest orchards in the whole of Assam where orange, pineapple and banana of an excellent quality are cultivated, are to be found here. The most striking natural feature of the Khasi area is

provided by the large number of rivers and rivulets coupled by some wavering waterfalls and picturesque surroundings. The climate of the whole area is very salubrious and Shillong has developed into a fashionable and popular health resort. This hill tract is richly covered with forests of sal, oak, pine and host of other woods while bamboo flourishes on the low hills of the north and the west. The fauna largely consists of bees, fowls, pigs, monkeys elephants, tigers, deer, wild dogs, etc.

RACIALLY the Khasis are sharply differentiated from the Indo-Mongoloid tribes surrounding them. According to the majority opinion they are an off-shoot of the Mon people of further India and they exhibit a fairly close proximity to the Malay type. Linguistically, they belong to the Mon-Khmer family because they speak a dialect that belongs to the Mon-Khmer branch of Austric family. They are, probably the only known representative of this family in India. Under the influence of the Christian missionaries they have adopted the Roman script, though in some places they still follow Bengali script.

THE term Khasi has particular significance. Kha means bom of and Si refers to an ancient mother. It assumes a great degree of significance when one tries to go into their social origin because apparently the name Khasi is itself indicative of their matrilieal system of reckoning descent.

PRESENTLY, a majority of the Khasis (about 55%) have embraced Christianity with some choosing Islam or Hinduism and the remaining still adhering to their original faith.

Settlement Pattern and Housing: The Khasi villages are usually situated a little below the hill tops, generally in small depressions unlike those of their neighbouring Naga and the Kuki tribes who prefer the summit of the hills. Since their economic life is intimately connected with their permanent fields for cultivation, they seldom change their village sites. Moreover, they have sentimental attachment with the memorial stones of their dead.

A TRADITIONAL Khasi house is made lai^gely of wood, bamboo and stones. It is oval shaped with low roof and a small entrance. The house is generally erected on a plinth some two to three feet above the ground. An ordinaiy Khasi house, consists of three portions, viz, a porch, a centre room and a retiring room. The hearth is generally situated in the retiring room with inadequate provision for the smoke to melt out of the room. With the growing prosperity and trends of modernization the traditional pattern is giving wayo modem

designs. Nowadays the houses are rectangular and corrugated iron sheets and tin sheets are being used for walls and roofs and economically sound Khasis have bunglows of modem style with iron roof, chimneys, glass windows and beautiful doors.

Social Organization: As already mentioned the Khasis include a number of sub-tribes each inhabiting a particular tract, speaking little vaiying dialects but sharing a common socio-cultural tradition. Each of these groups or sub-tribes is divided into a number of clans locally known as Kur. These clans are strictly exogamous and their member are not allowed to marry within their clans. Infact it is considered the greatest sin for a Khasi to marry within his clan. The members of these clans trace their descent from a common ancestress locally called Ka iawbei tynrai which means mother-progenitor, they attach great reverence to such mother ancestress and erect memorial stones as a mark of respect.

SIGNIFICANTLY some of these clans are named after certain animals and trees which is indicative of totemic practices but they are no more revered. The Khasi clans are characterised by a system of matrilineal descent which means that the descent is carried through female line downwards. The foremost function of a clan is to regulate marriage and the relationship between the clansmen is well exhibited on a ceremonial occasion when uncalcinated bones of a deceased member are transferred temporarily before their final disposal in the clan ossuary. The social bond is further characterised by the performance of common religious ceremonies, worship of common deities and spirits and the observance of mourning for a fellow clansman. Common ownership of land exhibits economic ties between members of clan. The clan is further subdivided into sub clans locally known as Kpoh. It is composed of the descendants of one great grandmother.

FAMILY or household is the smallest social unit of a sub-clan. It is denoted by a terming and it carries far reaching significance. A family generally consists of the grandmother, her daughters, their husbands and children. The grandmother is recognized as the head of the family as long as she survives. The permanent members of a family are the daughters who after their marriage, settle in their mother's family alongwith their husbands. The son after his marriage goes to live in his wife's family thus giving the matrilineal Khasi family a vertically extended structure. In a classical matrilineal family the youngest daughter holds the most prominent place because only she is entitled to live in the main house while the remaining ones

have to establish new homes either in the compound or in the adjacent quarters. Although the mother is always regarded as owner of the house but the actual authority lies with the father. This contradicts any such notion that in matriarchal-matrilineal society males have to contend with a subordinate status. In the scheme of division of labour males are expected to cany on agricultural chores, house construction, hunting and fishing and the females perform household chores alongwith the occasional work on the orchards.

A KHASI is supposed to marry within his sub tribe but they are not strongly rigid on this issue. They are strictly monogamou.s; polyandry is unknown to them and polygyny having little chance to be accepted in a matriarchal society. Like the majority of Indian tribes they are clan exogamous which implies that they have to marry outside their clan. The job of selection of spouse is fairly simple. A young man gets attracted to a girl or develops a liking for her and convey it to his parents. The rest is taken care of by the elders and the marriage is performed with elaborate ceremonies and much fanfare. Significantly, the range from which one has to select one's spouse is quite narrow because marriage is not unconditional. Traditionally a man can marry his mother's brother's daughter only after the death of his mother's brother. Same is the case with his father's sister's daughter. Also, a man can marry his Tribal Education deceased wife's younger sister but he cannot marry his wife's sister even after divorce as long as the divorced wife is alive. They do not practice child marriage.

IN CONFORMITY with the norms of a matriarchal-matrilineal society the mother's brother holds an important position. He manages the mother's ancestral property and looks after important social ceremonies. Thus, lack of importance and authority of a man is compensated through his predominantly significant status in the affairs of her sister's family.

HOUSE and all movable property is owned by the wife and though the husband is regarded as the executive head of the family he enjoys no property rights. Even the self acquired property of a man before his marriage cannot be retained by him and goes to the common family fund of his maternal grandmother or mother. A part of the property acquired by the man after his marriage is given to the members of his clan and the rest goes to his wife and children. All moveable property and the house of the family are inherited by the youngest daughter. The landed property in the absence of any will goes to the youngest daughter. If the deceased mother wished to

distribute it among tall the daughters, the youngest one gets the greater share. It is by virtue of her position as the youngest daughter locally known as iing Khaduh, that she is enjoined to perform all the religious rights and ceremonies of the family especially those related with its ancestress and that is why she is duly rewarded for shouldering this responsibility. With the spread of modem education and growing influence of Christianity the complexion of the situation is undergoing rapid changes among the Christian Khasis where the youngest daughter or for that matter any member of the family does not have to perforni all those religious rites and ceremonies due to change of religion and all the daughters are supposed to be equal. But in many cases the youngest daughter does not reconcile to this situation and demands the status of sole heiress of all the property and thus complicates the matter further.

THE traditional Khasi political organization still prevails in the land, though the advent of the British rule and the promulgation of the Constitution of India have modified it to a certain extent. It is characterised by an elaborate system of State, its chief and a council of ministers. The Khasi 'state' is formed by the voluntary association of villages or groups of villages. The head of the state or chief is called siem but his authority is very limited. The siem cannot perform any important business independently and he has to depend upon his durbar (court) which is an executive, council having judicial powers. He manages his state through the council of ministers. He exercises his judicial powers with the help and concurrence of the jury. In the absence of any system of land revenue the income of the Khasi state is quite meagre. Apart from the judicial fines, the most important source of state income is the collection of tolls that are chaiged on the commodities sold in the market. As the executive head of the state he is responsible for such work as the maintenance of the village paths, overseeing the safety of the orchards, maintenance of the markets, collection of toll and a host of other minor responsibilities. Originally the siem used to be a hereditary office and he was always succeeded by the eldest son of the his eldest sister and it was controlled by a small electoral body constituted by the heads of certain priestly clans. At present he is elected through adult franchise.

THE trjKiitional Khasi religion is characterised by theistic and aftfrrtistic beliefs where propitiation of spirits constitutes the important segment of religious rites. Kja lawbei is the most popular and revered ancestress and a laige number of megaliths are testimony to her

predominant position in the Khasi pantheon. Besides her there are also some other ancestral spirits. Natural phenomena exercise tremendous influence upon them and each of their villages has its own quota of sacred groves. Under the impact of Christianity and Hinduism their religion is undergoing important changes. Even among the non converted the traditional concepts have much heed affected especially by western education and exposure to newer populations and ideas. The non converts cremate their dead but after retaining the dead body in the home for some time.

ECO-System and Economy: The natural environment has inevitably, made a deep imprint on the people and has provided materials towards moulding and shaping the pattern of piasi life and culture. Although a growing number of them are now employed in government offices or are working as teachers, physicians, nurses, magistrates, administrators, merchants and businessmen the majority of them is still attached with the exploitation of land. The extent of their adaptation in the local physical environment may be gauged from the fact that even those who no more depend upon the exploitation of land and are engaged in other occupations have no qualms or hesitation in taking to hoe in their spare time. Even such people still love a day out in the woods hunting and fishing.

THE Khasis are living in a food producing economy. Cultivation of land, horticulture and domestication of animals form the principal occupation of the large majority of the Khasis. A monograph dealing with their economic aspects of life has rightly observed that no other among the hill tribes can compete with the Khasis in the value of their staples or the enlighted character of their agriculture.

DUE to its rugged and irregular nature a substantial portion of land always remains under water or quite wet while the rest remain diy. In order to cope with this situation they have developed two types of cultivation viz, dry and wet cultivation. The dry cultivation is done in clayey soil. The procedure being followed is that in winter the soils are turned up with the hoe and are left to dry for about two months or so. Then the grasses are collected and burnt and the ashes are strewn over the field. Now the seeds of paddy, millet and other crops are sown. Bottoms of the valleys and depressions between two hills are considered as ideal places for wet cultivation. The land so obtained is divided into numerous blocks with high embankments. After this an irrigation channel is made to pass through these embankments in such a way that each block receives only the desired quantity of water. For sowing, the soil is prepared by hoeing and

ploughing the muddy land. When the crop is ready for harvest the ripened corns are collected. Significantly the reaping is done by hands under the force of custom.

BESIDES the above mentioned modes of cultivation another method is also resorted to, generally on forest land, which is known as Jhum cultivation. This is simply a version of shifting cultivation. This is an age old institution among the hill tribes of India. This method involves the cultivation of a plot of land for a temporary period and then leaving it fallow. It consists of clearing the forest slopes by burning the fallen trees and bushes, and broadcasting the seed in the ash covered soil. The rest is left to nature. Maize and other coarse grains are main crops for Jhum cultivation. This method of cultivation is partly responsible for the fast pace of deforestation and attempts are being made to wean the Jhum cultivators away to settled mode of cultivation like the rest of the Khasi cultivators. Besides rice which is their principal crop, various kinds of millet, maize, potato, orange, beetelnut, paan (betel), pineapple, pulses and vegetables are also grown. Potato and orange are their cash crops and fetch them money.

THE Khasis also practice hunting and fishing and supplement their food with rich meat. As a matter of fact they resort to occasional hunting and fishing as a sport and pastime rather than as an economic activity. Bows, arrows and spears are the chief weapons of hunting and sometimes trained dogs also lend a helping hand. Big games are hunted by way of pitfalls, traps etc. while small ones and birds are taken care of with the help of bow and arrow. Communal hunting is still very much cherished by them specially in killing tigers. With the enactment of statutory ban on killing tigers this practice has almost been given up but a brief description of it shall interest the readers. At first the trained dogs get the scent of the tigers and the bush is encircled. Now the group is divided with hunting dogs and some men on one side and the drum beaters and shouters on the other side. When the scared tiger comes out the expert hunters with their dogs chase the tiger to a freshly dug out pit. When the prey falls into the pit it is covered with dried leaves and logs, a fire is put on and the tiger is burnt. As far as the fishing is concerned, poisoning of stream is the traditional and most popular way. With the introduction of nets, small fishes are now caught with its help. Like communal hunting, communal fishing is also cherished by them.

SIGNIFICANTLY, although they have completely come out of the food gathering economy, it does not stand in the way of following

their traditional mode of gathering forest produce like roots, tubers, fruits, firewood etc. It goes a long way in providing them some much needed nutrients and at the same time helps them maintain their ties with their erstwhile abode.

THEY have also taken to rearing of animals and their livestock consists mostly of pigs, cows, sheep and goats. When the cattle reach maturity they are sold to the traders in plains. They also rear bees on a substantial scale and after consuming some honey fondly. sell the surplus away.

SERICULTURE, weaving, spinning and dying are some such crafts where the Khasis feel quite at ease though the mill made clothes are fast catching up. They also make earthen pottery and are quite deft in using the black clay for making a variety of earthen vessels. They also practice bamboo work and make mats, baskets and other items of everyday life. Bamboo pipes used as water containers are the proof of the local genius. They are aware of iron smelting and are expert blacksmiths.

THE staple diet of Khasis is rice followed by potato which is also consumed in large quantities. They are very fond of taking meat of different animals and relish beef, mutton, chicken and pork. Hinduised Khasis however, avoid beef. Fresh fish is also taken as a delicacy among them. Formerly they did not like milk and almost abhorred it but with the spread of Christianity the consumption of milk has picked up. They are hard drinkers and consume large quantities of locally brewed liquor of rice and millet.

THE Khasis are inveterate chewers of pan leaf and beetelnut. Many of them irrespective of age and sex, indulge in this. Their addiction to the beetelnut may be gauged by the fact that in the interior parts of their lands the distance is often measured by the number of beetelnuts that are usually chewed on a journey. This addiction touches the fringe of obsession and many Khasis fancy of heaven as a huge betel nut garden.

Problems and Prospects : The problems facing the Khasis are not much different from the problems of hill people of India and in the context they practically do not have any economic problems exclusively their cwn. They do have some political and socio-political problems of their own but they chose not to go Naga or Mizo way of obtaining their objectives. Implicitly and explicitly there has always been a realization among the Khasis that they are a part of the Indian nation. Significantly, inspite of the influence of foreign

missionaries like the case with Mizos and Nagas, the Khasis never believed in the philosophy of separation from the rest of India. Their aspirations have largely been motivated by the. desire for safeguarding their economic interests from the economically more advanced neighbouring communities and maintaining their cultural identity in the vast sea of India, or to be more precise Hinduism.

THE birth of Meghalaya in 1970, an autonomous state within Assam, was the culmination of the political movement started by the people of the United Khasi and Jaintia Hills and the Garo hills. Then Meghalaya became a full fledged state in 1972 and they attained their aspired goal. This has certainly diffused as potentially explosive situation.

ANOTHER problem faced by the Khasis is related with readjustment in a changing socio-cultural milieu. They have been trying to make as smooth a readjustment as possible in the face of cross currents of contacts with Christianity, Hinduism and to a lesser extent Islam. Surprisingly the basic structure of their society remained largely intact inspite of the centrifugal pull of a variety of cultural contacts. However, the matriarchal structure of the Khasi society has been considerably weakened.

THEIR first contact with Christianity dates back to the early years of the nineteenth century but oiganised efforts to spread Christianity were made for the first time only around 1950 by the Welsh Mission and, from then on, there was no looking back. Now around 60% of the Khasi population has embraced Christianity.

ALTHOUGH their contacts with the Hindus are quite, older than with Christians or Christianity but in the absence of any organised efforts of proselytisation, Hinduism could not make much of a head way. But many elements of Hinduism did creep in very smoothly which do not interfere with their social structure. Many Khasi siems formally embraced Hinduism followed by their subjects. The writings of some eminent Khasi authors also indicate that they have been influenced, to a certain extent, by the Hindu literary traditions. Now we find a substantial number of Hinduised Khasis who have adopted a different cultural ethos; for example such Khasis have stopped eating beef.

THE contact of the Khasis with Islam is also a significant development in the traditional structure of the Khasi society. Unlike Christianity, there has never been an oiganised attempt to spread Islam and convert the Khasi. It was simply due to the presence of a

small groups of Muslims who married Khasi women and thus started a gradual process of \*Muslimisation\* or Mslamistation\*. Muslims of as far away place as Uttar Pradesh, Kashmir, Kerala and Punjab had been visiting the Khasi land as traders and wanderers. Some of them settled there and married local Khasi women. Significantly these Muslim Khasis, though negligible in number, have been instrumental in bringing in a variety of changes in the local social structure. Initially they shared all the local social traits, except religion, with their non-muslim brethren. With the passage of time they started providing themselves as a harbinger of Important changes. The weakening of the pre-eminent position of the youngest daughter and then the growing decline of the very matriarchal system maybe ascribed to the presence of Muslim elements in the Khasi society. Interestingly most of the Muslim Khasis declare that their religion has nothing to do with their tribal identity. Their claim alongwith such claims of Christian and Hindu Khasis may be taken as true. But the opening up of the Khasi land coupled with the cross currents of Hinduism, Christianity, Islam and tribalism are changing the simple tribal society of the Khasis to a sort of complex society. The Khasis are in for a bewildering variety of pressures and pulls hitherto unknown to them.

## (d) THE ORAON

THE Oraon, one of the major tribes of India, represent the agriculturist segment of tribal population. They are distributed over a large tract of eastern India. They are concentrated mostly in the plateau of Chotanagpur and occupy large areas of Ranchi, Palamau, adjoining districts Bihar and the neighbouring states of Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. Due to loss of land, population pressure and atrocities a lai^ge number of them have left their traditional habitat and have settled down as labourers in the tea gardens of Assam and West Bengal.

THE traditional abode of the Oraon i.e. Chotanagpur contains rich flora and fauna. Here one sees a rich growth of sal and mahua trees. Bamboo also grows in abundance. The fauna consists of tiger, leopard, bear, sambhar, antelope, spotted dee, hare, different varieties of snake, etc. Several types of birds also inhabit this region.

MOST of the Oraons speak a language of their own which belongs to the Dravidian family. It carries influence of those languages that are spoken in the vicinity wherever the Oraons live. That is why the influence of Oriya, Bengali and Hindi most discemable. Racially,

the Oraons are put in the Pre-Dravidian or Proto-Autraloid category. Physically, they are characterised by dark brown complexion, black hair, black eyes and medium stature.

Settlement Pattern and Housing: The settlement pattern of the Oraon shows a marked preference for high altitude. Most of the Oraon villages are traditionally situated on the higher level of usually cultivable wasteland. The houses are generally huddled together in disorderly fashion. The houses are mud built with tiled roofs. The relatively affluent ones maintain kitchen-garden in the rear for domestic consumption.

Social Organization: The popular mode of family among the Oraons is nuclear family which consists of husband, wife and their unmarried children. The bride comes to reside in her husband's house after marriage, but the husband residing with his in-laws is also not uncommon. Being a partriarchal and patrilocal tribe the authority in the family lies with the eldest male member. In the local scheme of division of labour adult males work on the fields and the females assist them and also do the whole of the domestic chores. Grown-up children also contribute to family economy.

THE Oraons recognise both types of kinship bonds viz. consanguineal and aftinai. The rule of descent is patrilineal and the clan name descends from father to son. The Oraons are divided into exogamous clans. Their clan names are taken from their respective totems. Hence these are derived from birds, fish, vegetables, plants, minerals or whatever totem they followed. For example Tirki clan name has been derived from young mice, Lakra from tiger, Bek from salt and so on. Like most of the totem following tribal groups, Oraons too do not eat or destroy their totem and consider it as a sacred heritage. Though the totems are neither ritually worshipped nor it is believed by them that they have descended from it yet these are revered and sometimes their replica is exhibited.

AS REGARDS marriage, monogamy is the most popular mode of matrimony. In exceptional cases one is allowed to go for more than one wife but polyandry is not permitted. The force of tribal endogamy is still very strong and those marrying outside the tribe are usually ex-communicated. Due to the concept of common ancestry they do not marry within the lineage or clan. Further, they also do not prefer the marriage of a boy with a girl of the same village. Like the majority of the Indian tribes Oraons, too, do not like child marriage. By force of tradition 'marriage by service' is also allowed in which the prospective groom serves the family of his prospective groom

serves the family of his prospective bride for some time, but such a way of acquiring mate has almost faded away from a number of Oraon villages. Due to changing values marriage by mutual consent or elopment seems to be the most prevalent way of marriage.

THEY are quite liberal vis-a-vis widow re-marriage and 'Junior Levirate' is resorted to which means that the widow is supposed to marry his diseased husband's younger brother. In case the younger brother cannot marry her then only she is free to marry anyone. Now-a-days a widow may also refuse to marry her diseased husband's younger brother. Divorce is also allowed and it is not infrequent. It is permissible on various grounds. Fugitiveness, laziness, adultery, barrenness, impotence, lunacy etc. may be valid grounds for seeking divorce. If the wife is found guilty, her parents are supposed to return the 'bride price' paid by the husband at the time of marriage and only then she can marry another man.

DUE to patrilineal nature of society the rule of inheritance is that when the head of the family dies the property is divided among all his surviving sons. As regards land, the eldest gets a small plot in excess of his usual share. When the sons are bom of different mothers, the sons by the first wife get larger share. And ex communicated son is not entitled to any share unless he is re-admitted to the social fold. A widow does not inherit but she is provided reasonable share for her proper maintenance, and an unmarried daughter, too, is entitled to a suitable maintenance until her marriage. All heirs of her deceased father are supposed to share the marriage expenses of their sister.

THE traditional political oiganization of the Oraons is based on the authority of the regional council called Parha-Panchayat A parha (region) is a territorial unit consisting of a number of contigous villages which may vary from five to thirty. Each parha defends its agricultural land, village sites, forest tracts, grazing lands, water supply, fishing pools, etc. One of the villages in a parha is cal led the raja village, another the dewan (prime minister) village, third the panrey (clerk), a fourth the Kotwar (orderly) village, and the remaining villages are the praja (subject) villages. The headman or mahato of the raja village acts as chairman. The village community is, in fact, administered by the authority of the pahan (village priest) and the mahato (secular head). Both these offices are usually hereditary. All the villages in the parha hunt together, fight together, and dance together at festivals. Although, the pahan and mahato exercise considerable authority, neither of them has economic or jural authority without the concurrence of the village panchayat.

THE religious beliefs of the Oraons are based on animism. Dharmesh, a spirit, is their supreme deity who is equated with sun for perpetuating light and life. They also have a strong belief in witchcraft and sorcery. The Oraon cremate their dead.

THE Oraons have been one of the tribes famous for their colourful youth dormitories locally called Dhumkuria. Though, under the impact of Christianity and outside influence this institution has almost faded away but wherever it still survives it fulfils a variety of functions. The Oraon dhumkuria caters mainly to the boys who are admitted to its membership at about eight years of age. A male supervisor known as dhangar mahato and a lady supervisor called barki dhangrin instruct the boys and girls in their social and religious duties. The dhumkuria boys and girls also serve as scouts. They cook at wedding, provide labour in house construction, run as errands, extend helping hands in the face of natural calamities, etc. If they receive cash in lieu of their services it is spent on dhumkuria; either musical instruments are purchased or it is spent on the upkeep and maintenance of dhumkuria. The boys and girls dance together and enjoy each other's company. It also provides opportunities to come together and freely mix with each other. This free mixing between boys and girls is, to a great extent, responsible for the negligible incidence of crimes against women. The advance of the so-called 'new civilization' has hit hard on this beautiful institution that has been serving the tribals of the region in a variety of ways. In several villages, the only thing left in the name of dhumkuria are dilapidated and neglected houses standing as memorial to a great social institution of the tribal folks.

ECO-System and Economy : Like the other major tribes of Chotanagpur, Oraons are also agriculturists. Hunting-gathering, fishing, cattle rearing and handicrafts are no more their primary occupation, but activities in leisure or any eventuality. In some cases these may be taken as their subsidiaiy occupation. Many of them who have become landless' or have land of uneconomic nature provide labour in road construction and other activities. A large number of them are also engaged in mines and tea gardens. They grow coarse rice, millet, pulses and oilseeds. Since most of their fields are unirrigated, they have to depend entirely on nature's generosity. As far as the food gathering is concerned it is confined mainly to roots, tubers, fruits and flowers. They also collect honey from honey combs whenever they find one.

THE livestock play an important role in their overall family economy. They rear such animals as cows, buffaloes, goats, pigs, sheep and

fowl. Goats and sheep supply them with meat and also serve as sacrificial animals. They also relish pork and it is usually consumed during festival season. Among the birds, they rear ducks which is a steady source of ' supply of meat and egg. They do not seem to be very fond of milk which is used mainly in preparing tea or for ailing children. Their staple food is rice and pulse and their vegetarian requirements are fulfilled by wild plants, leaves, roots and tubers. They are also fond of smoking and chewing tobacco.

Problems and Prospects : Since some ground has already been covered in other chapters, even a brief overview will do. Most of the tribal areas-of Bihar, including Oraon's habitats, have never been entirely isolated ^om the rest of the State. Non-tribal Hindu and Muslim communities have been living in the midst of the tribes for several centuries. There is hardly any tribal village in which a few Hindu caste families do not reside. They provide certain essential services for the tribals and speak the tribal languages. In many ways they have also been a source of destabilization of the tribal social organization and also their exploitation. At the same time they have also been a source of culture change.

ONE OF their most glaring problems is land alienation. As Sachchidanand (1972) rightly points out, most of the land in tribal areas has been reclaimed from the forest and made fit for cultivation by them and their forefathers. As they are predominantly agriculturalists, they are deeply attached to land. Land is not just a means of subsistence for them, it is a spiritual bond between them and their ancestors. As such any loss of land is deeply resented by them. The process of land alienation has been in operation for a long time. The recurrent needs of cash, frequent famines and die habit of drinking have forced the tribals into the clutches of moneylenders who are mainly responsible for grabbing their land. Land acquired in the wake of industrialization (see Chapter on "Problems') has also been a source of land alienation.

IN THE matter of planned development they feel that they have always been neglected. Obviously agriculture in tribal areas cannot look up unless a big boost is given in providing irrigation facilities. They have, by and laige, not benefitted even from industrialization. Despite a plethora of schemes their claims have been skipped over even for unskilled jobs and no concrete scheme ever implemented for their industrial training.

SINCE education has made impressive headway in the whole of the tribal region the Oraon's level of aspirations has also risen.

Unemployment among the educated Oraons is also mounting which further pushes them into frustration.

AS THE majority of the tribal agriculturists of this region are not able to produce enough for their subsistence, they have been in the practice of going out to seek employment in the four month's lean agricultural season. Hence, migration has also been one of their problems; they go to the tea gardens of Assam and North Bengal, to the jute mills and brick kilns round about Calcutta and, of course lately, to Punjab and Haryana as agricultural labour.

AS RIGHTLY pointed out by Jyotisen (1972) apart from the Christian Missions, there seems to be no voluntary organization which takes intelligent and effective interest in welfare of the tribals. There is none utilization of the official benefits meant for them. to give them proper guidance in matters relating to proper

THEY have become part of the larger Jharkhand movement. The maladies that gave rise to this popular movement are economic, administrative, sociopsychologicai and political (for details please see the chapter on "Regionalism"). Official apathy and indifference have been allowing the situation to drift more and more. Let those responsible for the present state of affairs understand that these tribal people are also normal, thinking human beings and their patience, too, cannot be stretched beyond a certain limit. The problems cry for solution.
