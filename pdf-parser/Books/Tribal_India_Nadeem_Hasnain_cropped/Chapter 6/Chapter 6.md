THE economic organization of Indian tribes is not different from the primitive economic organizations of other parts of the world. Basically, their economy is geared to the satisfaction of basic subsistence needs and hence they fall into the broad category of production-consumption economies. Contrasting this system with the more advanced one, Majumdar (1967) comments that with the accumulation of an economic surplus, human attention is increasingly devoted not only to various material needs other than food, sex and shelter but also to the refinement of the manner in which these three primary, and other derived and secondary, needs are satisfied. These latter types of economies are called the production-consumptiondistribution type.

ANOTHER very remarkable characteristic of contemporary primitive economies is that they used to be run in the absence of currency and other modern economic phenomena before their contacts with the modern world. Primitive societies living in isolation are still managing without these monetary instruments.

BEFORE taking up the economic organizations of Indian tribes, it seems imperative to make a brief overview of various types of economies man evolved as a result of cultural adaptation in different situations. Adam Smith was the first scholar who tried to present a classification of economic organization. He talked of hunters, pastoralists and agriculturists and later the categories of handicrafts and industrial pursuits were added to make it more comprehensive. Ernest Grosse, with the help of evolutionary perspective, put forward the following stages of development:

- (/) Collectional economy,
- (//) Cultural nomadic economy,
- (Hi) Settled village economy,
- (iv) Town economy,
- (v) Metropolitan economy.

SIMILARLY, Ehrenfels has put forward the four economic types among the early human societies of South Asia:

- (/) Food gatherers,
- (//) Higher hunters,
- (///) Plant cultivators,
- (iv) Nomadic herdsmen.

MOST of the tribal people of India fall under the first and the third of these categories.

DARYLL forde (1950) does not agree with the idea of economic stages because he does not believe that people live at economic stages and finds no single exclusive economy but combinations cf economies; the growth of cultures. Gordon Childe holds more or less the similar opinion with regard to prehistoric economies. Ford agrees with Herskovits' (1952) five-fold division of economies:

- (/) Collection,
- {if) Hunting,
- (Hi) Fishing,
- (iv) Cultivation,
- (v) stock raising.

ALSO, both agree that a people need not abandon one economy to adopt another.

THURNWALD has presented a scheme of various types of economic life, some of which concern us directly:

- (1) Homogeneous communities of men as hunters and trappers, women as collectors. The Kadar, the Chenchu, the Kharia, the Korwa are some of the Indian tribes falling into this category.
- (2) Homogeneous communities of hunters, trappers and agriculturists. The Kamar, the Baiga and the Birhor are examples of this type rom tribal India.
- (3) Graded society of hunters, trappers, agriculturists and artisans. Most of the Indian tribes fall under this category.
- (4) The herdmen. The Toda and some sections of the great Bhil tribe furnish classic examples in India.
- (5) Homogeneous hunters and herdmen. This categoiy is not represented among Indian tribes. The Todas do not hunt nor do they catch fish or birds.
- (6) Ethnically stratified cattle breeders and traders. The Bhotiyas of the SwO-Him'alayan region of Uttar Pradesh breed yaks and

jibus (cross between yak and cow) and are itinerant traders; they come down to the plains in winter and go over the hills right upto Tibet in summer.

(7) Socially graded herdmen with hunting, agricultural and artisan population.

THESE are some of the important classifications encompassing various facts of economic life as lived in different comers of the world. But it does not seem possible to study the economic organization of Indian tribes on the basis of any single classification given above. Every tribe lives by a variety of economic activities. A certain type of activity may be playing a dominant role in the economic oiganization but some others are also there to supplement. However, the tribes of India may be divided into following broad categories on the basis of dominant economic activities in the respective economies:

- (/) Food gatherer and hunter
- (//) Shifting cultivator
- (///) Cultivator
- (/v) Pastoral ist
- (v) Artisan
- (v/) Industrial labour

## Food Gatherers and Hunters

THIS is a fast vanishing category of tribes which persist in deep forests and mountain ranges. Due to fast expanding means of communication and consequently increasingjailture'Cdntacts with the people possessing advanced techndlb^ they are turning into cultivators. However, there are some tribes who still depend upon collection and hunting unaware of the techniques of cultivation.

THIS category includes those who earn their livelihood through collection of edible roots, fruits and honey and hunt small animals for food. They also go for fishing if the avenues are there. Some such tribes also collect wax, gum tusks, etc., for the purpose of barter or exchange. In this way they are able to fulfill their essential needs even in the absence of cultivation of foodgrains.

THE dependence of gathering and hunting people on nature is so pronounced that they appear to be a part of the nature exhibiting excellent mode of cultural adaptability. Most of such tribes are found in southern India and prominent among them are the Kadar inhabiting

the forests of Cochin; Malapatram, Paliyan, Irula, and Kurumba of Tamil Nadu and the Chenchu dwelling in the Annamalai mountain ranges of Andhra Pradesh. Besides, the Birhor and the Kharia of Bihar, Kamar, Baiga and Abhujmaria of Madhya Pradesh, Yenadi of Andhra Pradesh, Koya and Kontareddi of Tamil Nadu and Katkari of Maharashtra may also be included in this category. The Onge, Jarwa, etc., of Andaman Islands also fall in this category. Though most of the above mentioned tribes are also engaged in some other subsidiary economic pursuits, yet the dominant mode of economic oiganization still remains food gathering and hunting.

MOST of the characteristics of primitive economic oiganization are present in the economies of food gathering and hunting tribes of India, foremost of which is the lack of resources, tools and implements. Mostly, they live by their physical prowness and competence amidst the aweful lack of technological alternatives which is quite natural at this stage of technological development. The veiy notion of 'surplus' is absent in their economies because neither they are in a position to generate surplus nor they are equipped to preserve the surplus commodities of everyday life. Furthermore, their nomadic existence also prohibits the development of techniques of preservation and conservation among them. Since their entire physical existence is spent in procuring food, there is hardly any scope for rapid development in any other sphere of life.

# Shifting Cultivators

A CONSERVATIVE estimate suggests that more than 90 percent of the total population in India practise one type of agriculture or the other. Most of the Indian tribes who depend upon agriculture follow this pursuit in two ways viz, primitive and traditional mode of slash and bum known as shifting cultivation and settled or plough cultivation with the help of various types of agricultural tools and implements. Since the problem of shifting cultivation among the Indian tribes has been dealt with in detail in a separate chapter on 'Shifting Cultivation' a brief account shall suffice in the present chapter.

SHIFTING cultivation is an age-old institution among the Indian tribes. This, in principle, means the cultivation of a plot of land for a temporary period and then leave it fallow. It consists of clearing the forest slopes, burning the fallen trees and bushes, and broadcasting the seed in the ash covered soil. The rest is left to nature. The sowing on the plot may be done for one or more seasons but not

beyond this. After that, fertility of the soil is exhausted and then another plot of land is cleared and the agricultural operations are transferred to it.

IN INDIA this mode of cultivation existed in remote hill areas of north-eastern region, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and to a lesser extent in several other parts of the country. Although, it has been declared unlawful in most of the areas, it still exists on a lesser scale.

SHIFTING cultivation is known by different regional names in India. It is called Jhum among the tribes of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh; Bewar or Dahya in Madhya Pradesh; Podu in Andhra Pradesh; and Roman or Bringal in north Orissa. The major tribes practising it are Lohta, Angami Naga, Khasi and Kuki of north eastern region, Asura of Bihar, Saora and Juang of Orissa, Baiga and Gond of Madhya Pradesh and Korwa of Uttar Pradesh.

AN INTERESTING aspect of shifting cultivators is that they themselves inhabit permanent villages in a more or less settled way but keep on changing the plot of land for the purpose of procuring foodgrains.

I'ILL recently, the shifting cultivators confined their agricultural pursuit to producing only foodgrains and cereals. Now some of them have started growing even cash crops clinging to their age-old mode of cultivation. The shifting cultivators of Assam, Meghalaya and Nagaland grow cotton as cash crop while maize, vegetables, etc., are grown for domestic consumption. The Juangs of Orissa produce oil seeds as cash crop and paddy for themselves.

SINCE this mode of cultivation is highly uneconomic due to extremely low yield, most of the shifting cultivators spend their days in poverty and misery. It has been pointed out that if shifting cultivation is not stopped it will tie down the tribes practising it to an underdeveloped and low socio-economic level. However, it must be recognized that a change over from shifting to permanent plough cultivation cannot take place suddenly as the economic life of a people is woven inextricably with all the other aspects of their life.

## Cultivators

MOST of the Indian tribes have adopted the popular mode of cultivation, i.e., permanent plough cultivation like the rest of the peasantry of India. Such tribal cultivators have their own plots of

land for agriculture and they employ various animals and agricultural implements in their agricultural pursuits. Adoption of this mode of agriculture has been either due to highly uneconomic and unproductive nature of shifting cultivation or due to culture contacts with the neighbouring peasantiy.

THE Mizos of Mizoram and the Apatanis of Apatani valley in Arunachal Pradesh are two such examples of shifting cultivators emerging as expert cultivators. The Mizos grow various varieties of rice which is their staple food. The Apatanis are also expert cultivators of rice. Both men and women work together with dedication in the field and despite their lack of knowledge of modern agricultural implements and manures, get enough yield. They grow crops either on the meshy lands of lower plains or the terraces prepared on the mountains. Terrace cultivation which is another type of permanent plough cultivation provides a classic example of cultural and ecological adaptability of these people. The streams of upper forests are tapped in such a ways as to provide each terrace sufficient quantity of water and, if need be, extra water may be siphoned out. Though quite labour consuming, it exhibits the extreme dedication of the cultivator.

AMONG the tribals of India who have emerged as expert cultivators are the Santhal, Oraon and Ho of Bihar (including Jharkhand) and Bengal, Tharu and Korwa of Uttar Pradesh (including Uttrakhand), Gond, Bhil and Bhilala of Madhya Pradesh (including Chhatisgarh). Saora of Orissa and Badaga of Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu.

THE Tharus and Korwas of Uttar Pradesh have adopted settled cultivation to such an extent that they are aware of all the means of agriculture. Cowdung manure is used extensively, and dams are harnessed for irrigation and, above all, they grow Rabi and Kharif crops with the precision of the neighbouring peasantiy.

IT IS also commonly observed that the tribes who have embraced Christianity are highly advanced in agriculture as compared to other tribes. This may be due to the fact that missionaries working in these areas have not only preached the gospel of Christianity but have also equipped their followers to grasp the modern means of economic pursuits and take advantage of various developmental schemes floated by government and other developmental agencies. In this connection, the educational institutions run by missionaries are playing important role in shaping the destiny of the concerned tribal people.

### Pastoralists

PASTORAL economy is another aspect of economic organization of the tribes of India. Most of the Indian tribes rear cattle for a variety of purposes but when a people breed and rear cattle for commercial purposes and make it their source of livelihood, they may be said to be living under pastoral economy. The Indian pastoralists usually lead a settled life and become wanderers and nomads only under the pressure of changing weather. The pastoral tribes who inhabit mountainous regions migrate to the plains alongwith their cattle during severe winters but go back to their permanent abode at the advent of summer. Hence, they may be termed more or less as 'settled pastoralists'. Probably, this is a response to the urge of entering settled life from the food gathering hunting nomadic life of bygone ages.

AMONG the Indian tribes the famous Toda, inhabiting Nilgiri Hills of Tamil Nadu, furnish a classic example of pastoral economy, their social and economic organization being built around their buffaloes. The Toda, in the words of Majumdar, "obtain their living by drawing directly upon milk and milk products and by exchanging the same with neighbouring people to acquire other necessities of life. The buffaloes are ubiquitous, figuring in all aspects of their life. They form the economic base of Toda culture. They or their milk, play the prominent part in the socio-religious life of the tribe. The daily life of the Toda men is mainly devoted to the maintenance and care of their buffaloes and dairies"

THE Gujjars of Himachal Pradesh are also prominent pastoralist and they rear cows, buffaloes and sheep for commercial purposes. The Bhotia of Uttarakhand division of Uttar Pradesh are cattle breeders and traders at the same time. They breed yak and jihus and weave woollen pullovers, shawls and blankets and sell them in the cities of the plains. In this way, they are itinerant traders who come down to the plains in winter and traditionally go over the hills right upto Tibet in summar. But after the outbreak of war with China in 1962, their trade with Tibet has been ruined and now they depend mainly on the rearing of sheep and goat for milk, meat, and wool. These animals are also used as beasts of burden. Under the increasing pressure of fast changing economic life they are also adopting agriculture as one of the means of livelihood.

### Artisans

ARTISANS practising various handicrafts are found in all tribal zones of India. But there are very few tribal communities who live

by their handicrafts alone. Many tribal communities take it as their subsidiary occupation often pursued in leisure to supplement their income. The Maria Gonds distil spirit from forest produce. The Saoras devote themselves to metal working, weaving, can working, pottery and so on. The Korwas and the Agarias are traditionally well-known iron smelters, producing tools for local use only, their techniques being very crude. The Ghasis make gut from the fibre tissues of animals. The Tharus make furniture, household utensils, baskets, musical instruments, weapons, rope and mats. The Irulas make bamboo mats and baskets, and plough-shares and wheels for local use only.

THE Apatanis are expert makers of knives and swords and manufacture them for commercial purposes. The Kotas of Nilgiri Hills are efficient blacksmiths, carpenters and potters. The Mizos, Riangs, Nagas and Apatanis of north eastern region and the Saoras of Orissa are expert weavers of cloth which they sell in the nearby markets. The Marias and Muria Gonds of Bastar are famous for their toys and icons made of clay and metal which are marketed by various handicraft emporia in the country. The Bhils and Bhilalas of Jhabua district weave beautiful durris and cushions out of old clothes and cotton fibres.

## Industrial Labour

INDUSTRIAL labour is a comparatively new phenomenon in the economic organization of tribes of India. It encompasses very serious and significant implications. The problems of tribals as "industrial labour' have been dealt with in a separate chapter on 'Industrialization' in tribal areas in view of the serious nature of this problem. Indian tribal people have come into contact with industrial life in two ways. Either they have migrated to industrial areas or industries have sprung up in the areas they inhabit. Laige numbers of Santhals, Konds and Gonds have migrated to Assam and taken up various jobs in tea plantations. The other manner of contact with industrial life is more important in view of its far reaching consequences. Certain tribal areas in middle India have been found rich in natural ores; coal, iron and steel, and other industries have sprung up in these areas. This has happened particularly in West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. "Thus industrialization of these peoples' life has taken place, establishing a kind of tribalurban continuum" (Majumdar).

THE situation described above distinguishes two categories of tribes. The Santhal, Oraon, Munda, Kharia, Gond and some others may be

lumped together in the first category. In view of growing economic hardships, they migrate to Assam and the adjoining areas to work as tea plantation workers, while some members of the family migrate to other cities and towns to work as unskilled labour. The other category includes Santhals, Hos and others who are working in the mines and mills situated in their area. The steel complexes of Jamshedpur, Ranchi, Rourkela, Bhilai and Bailadila employ tribals in large numbers.

INDUSTRIALIZATION of these areas has certainly presented millions of tribal people new and permanent source of livelihood, but at a enormous and aweful cost. Industrialization and urbanisation have damaged their social fabric substantially. Decay and disintegration in their traditional social institutions have set in. Industrial values have distorted their own value system. Liquor addiction, gambling and prostitution are eating the vitals of their social oiganization. These Victims\* of industrialization have been pushed into an alien milieu without equipping them to face the hazards of a strange world.

## Division of Labour

COMPULSION of physiological factors like sex, infancy or old age and physical disability provide the only basis for specialization in pre-urban societies. Majumdar opines that besides this basic recognition of physiological differences and their implications which are reflected in the division of labour in primitive societies, there have been extentions of this basic fact which have resulted in further compulsive factors decreeing a sexual division of labour. The inability to understand the variety of physiological processes connected with healthy life of a woman, like menstruation and childbirth, has given rise to strange norms. The pampered and well-treated Toda women, for example, have been barred from touching the sacred buffalo or stepping into the dairy.

THE association of women with infants has also imposed checks on them, preventing their full participation in the tasl« of men. They have to take care of the infants and of cooking which naturally force them to stay longer at home. Among most of the Indian tribes, men never cook such food in which milk and milk products are used, obviously on ritualistic ground. Women do undertake most of the tasks generally done by men. Women among Indian tribes gather food; engage in cultivation (sowing and harvesting); go fishing; make baskets, cloth and pottery and so on. But they never go for

hunting big game, nor for felling trees, nor do they become blacksmiths or carpenters.

THE tribal women of hilly and mountainous regions are most hardworking, their menfolk being examples of laziness. The Khasa women of Jounsar-bawar in Uttar Pradesh are a glaring example of this situation. Here the women do all sorts of work from dawn to dusk, from collection of wood to carrying water from the mouth of steep slopes and from sowing and harvesting to taking care of the cattle, whereas the menfolk relax in tea stalls sipping tea, gossiping and smoking, discussing factional politics and scandals. The impact of industrialization, however, has affected both men and women. In such areas as affected by industrialization, men work in iron and steel factories, coal mines and tea gardens while women workers are engaged in mica and coal mines, in tea gardens, in quarries and so on. Engaging menial labourers is unknown in tribal India except among a couple of tribes like the Jounsari of Uttar Pradesh where Kolta, the traditionally landless and ritually untouchable section of the tribe, are kept as slaves, bonded forever by the higher caste Rajput-Brahmin landlords. Thus, except for a couple of such examples, division of labour into master and slave is unknown in tribal India.

# Property, Ownership and Succession

THE conception of property varies from one form of society to the other and hence modem conception of property cannot be applied to primitive societies. Among the tribes of India, ail the commodities controlled and regulated by social values may be termed as property. Misra and Tiwari (1975) while elaborating this point in the Indian context express the view that even among the food gathering and hunting tribes, forests and means or implements of food gathering and hunting constitute property. Though the members of the society are entitled to use and consume forest produce ^nd fauna in independent ways, yet their use is subject to certain social rules and values. Among the pastoral tribes, pastures, cattles, cattle-sheds, dwellings, clothes, objects obtained from animals, etc., are different forms of property. Similarly land, agricultural implements, house, clothing, etc., are forms of property among the agricultural tribes while sources of raw material, tools and implements, finished goods, clothing, houses, etc., constitute property among the artisan tribes.

AMONG the Indian tribes both types of ownership, viz., collective as well as individual, are fairly known. In whichever form property may be recognised, its recognition entails the existence of soige

rules of inheritance. Inheritance acquires particular importance when individuals possess property by themselves. In communal inheritance the group as a whole never ceases to exist suddenly as individual does, and is replenished through fresh recruitment from time to time. Though the emphasis nowadays is on individual ownership, there are instances like the Nagas who traditionally own the lands of the village collectively. Since the individual property is quite meagre, it is a custom among many tribes to bum the items of individual use alongwith the deceased.

THE laws of inheritance may be patrilineal or matrilineal or some kind of a combination of both depending upon the social structure of a particular society. The daughters inherit the property among the matrilineal tribes, like the Khasi of Meghalaya, and the sons among the vast number of patrilineal tribes. In some cases the eldest daughter or son inherits the entire property. Among the Toda tribe of Nilgiri Hills the eldest and the youngest son get an extra animal. The Badaga of the neighbouring region practise a different set of rules. Among these people the eldest son leaves home the moment he get married. It is the youngest son who remains in the house with his parents and he only inherits the property of his father and becomes his lawful successor.

## Market

EXCEPT with some food gathering and hunting tribes, the institution of market is seen to be present in one form or the other among almost all the tribes of India. However, regular markets are still a rarity among them. In most of the cases people assemble in an assigned place and on an appointed time and exchange their commodities with each other. Such markets are usually weekly or fortnightly. The markets held in tribal regions usually trade in commodities of local use like vegetables, cereals, meat, spices, salt, utensils, agricultural tools and implements, clothing, cosmetics, etc. Non-tribal traders are also seen to be interested in some of these markets which are visited by them in search of local produce at cheaper rates. Their transaction becomes easier when they lure the simple tribals with urban products and get away with the local produce at throw away prices.

THE tribal markets usually run for a few hours and during the day time. Some markets are held once a year and they continue for days. In the Bastar region of Madhya Pradesh such markets are known as Marai. These are held usually after harvest and people visit these

markets alongwith their families to buy necessary commodities for the year. Such markets present festive look where people sing and dance and engage in all sorts of merrymaking. They serve manifold purpose. Distant relatives meet each other, marriages are arranged, local politics is discussed and thus these annual markets carry a lot of social and cultural significance. To be more precise, the markets not only fulfil certain needs of the buyers and sellers but also act as agents of culture change.
