RESEARCH and training are the most important components in any scheme of tribal development and administration. These two components are vitaly right from the stage of planning to implementation because the feedback mechanism is always needed for a correct evaluation and assessment. This gives us the knowledge of what has been achieved and what remains to be achieved. As the Dhebar Commission Report puts it more explicitly, the development and welfare programmes for Scheduled Tribes should be in consonance and harmony with their way of life. This requires first hand information regarding their culture which includes their way of life, religion, etc., so that the development programmes can be adjusted to the tribals' needs and aspirations. The research into these aspects of tribal life is an essential prerequisite for effective planning.

### Research

THUS, research into their social organisation, value system and other segments of culture assumes important dimensions. Such research has several aspects. First, the collection of basic in'fbrmation regarding social oiganisation and economy of a tribe-its livelihood pattern, arts and handicrafts practised, its language, condition of its health, dietetics, etc. This will give not only first hand factual and statistical information but also help in the formulation of schemes with a tribal bias. Secondly, it is necessary to find out the economic potential of the area and how local talent and resources can be combined to develop tribal economy and raise the standard of living of the tribals. Thirdly, an assessment of the welfare measures undertaken from the point of view of physical taigets and the measures for acceleration of the progress of such schemes. And lastly, to study the effect of such schemes on the personality of tribals to gauge how far the development programme has helped the process of integration of the tribals with the rest of the population. Thus, the response of the taiget group, i.e. the tribals, to the governmental and non-governmental measures for their welfare is also crucial because on it depends the fate of the welfare and development programmes. At present the research in tribal welfare and ethnography is being conducted in one form or the other by the following agencies :

### (i) Government agencies

- (a) Cultural/Tribal Research Institutes,
- (b) Ministry of Home, Union Government,

## (ii) Other agencies

- (a) Universities
- (b) Non-official organisations.

FOLLOWING is a brief description of various institutes engaged in research into tribal life and problems :

### Tribal Research Institute, Bihar

BESIDES conducting socio-economic surveys and studies, it also runs orientation centre for providing training to the staff connected with the welfare activities. an

## Tribal Research Institute, Madhya Pradesh

IT CONDUCTS socio-economic surveys, provides orientation training to personnel engaged in tribal welfare and also undertakes the task of evaluation of schemes.

### Tribal Research Bureau, Orissa

IT UNDERTAKES studies of tribal life and evaluates various schemes for tribal welfere.

# Cultural Reseaifch Institute, West Bengal

BESIDES conducting various types of socio-economic studies, it also conducts philological studies in tribal languages with a view to preparing primers in these languages. It is also engaged in the evaluation of the schemes.

## Tribal Research Institute, Andhra Pradesh

IT CONDUCTS socio-economic surveys and studies, has compiled folk songs and has undertaken the study of psychological aspects of tribal life in the state.

BESIDES these centres and institutes. Tribal Research Institutes have been set up by the states of Assam, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. Recently, a separate research and evaluation cell under the Directorate, Harijan and Social Welfare, has also been opened in Uttar Pradesh. Besides conducting surveys in tribal areas, it also undertakes evaluation work.

IN ADDITION to these institutes, there is at Shillong a research unit set up by the North-East Frontier Agency (now Arunachal Pradesh)

### 482\_TRIBAL INDIA

and at Kohima, the Naga Institute of Culture started by the Government of Nagaland.

OTHER ^encies engaged in tribal research are the Anthropological Survey of India, the Handicrafts and Social Studies Unit of the office of the Registrar General of India, Tribal Education Unit of the National Council of Education, Research and Training (NCERT) and Universities, like the Universities of Lucknow, Udaipur. Raipur Baroda and Ranchi, etc. ^ '

THERE are also several non-official agencies which are also conducting surveys and researches in the field of tribal welfare. They are recipients of modest grants-in-aid. Prominent among such organisations are the Bhartiya Lok Kala Mandal, Udaipur and the National Council of Applied Economic Research, New Delhi. The former has prepared some documentary films on the tribes of Rajasthan and has conducted cultural survey of some tribes of Vindhya Pradesh and Mahakoshal regions of Madhya Pradesh. The Mandal has completed a report on the cultural survey of twelve tribes in Madhya Pradesh. The government has provided some grants-inaid for the completion of these works. The National Council of Applied Economic Research has also been doing commendable work. Besides making studies in non-tribal sectors, it has conducted a socio economic survey of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in Madhya Pradesh, covering Balaghat, Betul, Chindwara, Duig. Bastar. Mandla, Raigarh, Dhar and Raisen districts.

BESIDES there being full-fledged department of anthropology in universities, some universities have also conducted researches related with tribal life and culture. Some such universities are those of Agra, Bombay, Nagpur, Patna, Madras and some others.

ANY REVIEW of tribal research undertaken in the countiy would be incomplete without a reference to the valuable work of a basic nature done by the Census department which, besides compiling separate data on Scheduled Tribes with regard to their population, sex-ratio, rural- urban classification, occupational distribution, literacy levels, religion, etc., has prepared ethnographic notes on various tribes and mono^aphs On tribal handicrafts and on socio-economic conditions in about 300 villages in different parts of the countiy. The infonnation, thus collected during the census has facilitated intensive studies and led to a better appreciation of the present problems of Scheduled Tribes. The, need for associating the census oiganisation with the planning of research and development activities relating Scheduled Tribes needs no emphasis. to

REVIEWING the work done by several tribal research institutes, the . Shilu Ao Committee Report has made some significant observations. It observes that though they have been generally doing useful work, the tendency still persists in some of them to concentrate attention work of purely academic nature, while in certain others, much time which could otherwise be more profitably employed on research, is spent on the periodic collection of routine statistics, a type of work which could more appropriately be handled by the progress, , evaluation and coordination cells of the state governments. In same ' states-Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal-the tribal research institutes are located at the state capitals, while in others, they are located away from them. Thus the institute in Maharastra is located at Puna, the institute in Rajasthan at Udaipur and in Bihar at Ranchi. There is a school of thought which holds that it would make for a more intensive studies of tribal problem if the research institutes are located in the heart of the tribal areas. on

IT DOES not appear that tribal welfare departments have made adequate use of the research institutes to identify weaknesses in schemes which have either failed or not yielded expected results in order that mistakes may not be repeated and pitfalls avoided in the formulation of future programmes. Thus, the disappointing performance of land colonisation schemes, the dismal failure of housing programmes, the halting progress of cooperatives, the adverse consequences on tribals economy of laige scale acquisition of tribal land for industrial schemes and river Valley projects and a host of other matters affecting the welfare of the tribals could have been referred to the research institutes for investigation. It must be realised that tribal research institutes to be effective, cannot work in isolation and that in order to get the best out of them the tribal welfare departments should feed them with problems as and when they arise and profit by the findings of professional anthropologists, sociologists and economists engaged in the specialised field of tribal development

# Training

PUBLIC Administration in India in the pre-independence era was focussed on the maintenance of law and ordf and collection of revenue. The emphasis shifted towards developmental activities in the mid-fifties and the need for proper infra-structure including trained personnel, was intensely felt. As pointed out by GS. Grewal (1981) every training programme in development administration entails the matching of particular needs of personnel equipped with

#### 484 TRIBAL INDIA

various competences, with the goals of national or sectoral development. Development administration is a continuous cycle of formulating, evaluating and implementing inter-related measures to reach established objectives in a scheduled timesequence. It, therefore, basically differs from the traditional functions of administration such as the maintenance of a law and order and revenue collection. It is essentially concerned with planning and administering the social and economic changes. Training in development administration not only aims at inducing change in the persons' attitude and behaviour towards life but also induces him to work with the purpose of creating a dynamic and progressive society through the application of modern technology and humane social relations.

THE development concept in the areas where tribal way of life is predominant do not basically differ from those postulated in the development of under-developed non-tribal areas. As K.K. Srivastava (1981) puts it, the tribal areas are characterised by: (i) difficult terrain, often isolated for months, and (ii) backwardness due to long neglect by colonial administration. The tribal people have one thing in common, and that is they are, by and large, economically and socially backward. But ethnically, linguistically and culturally they are not only different from the general population but there is a lot of diversity even amongst themselves. Therefore, the personnel dealing with them need special training to understand and appreciate their problems before they embark on formulation and implementation of plans for their development. It was noted by the Elwin committee that the personnel working in Special Multi-Purpose Tribal Blocks (SMPTB), who came from different cultural and socio-economic background, were unable to appreciate tribal ways of life and could not understand the specific problems that tribals faced in different areas. This is just an instance to emphasise the need for proper training to the personnel engaged in tribal development at any level.

THE tribal development programmes reach the tribal communities through the following agencies :

- (i) Government officials functioning at different levels in the tribal development programmes and the general development programmes:
- (ii) Workers of the various non-official voluntary agencies and the personnel engaged by them:
- (iii) Office bearers and employees of the cooperatives and statutory organisations, for example, the panchayats etc.; and

## (iv) Village / tribal leaders.

THE various officials of the state governments engaged in planning and implementation of the tribal development programmes and are in need of training may be broadly classified under the following categories:

# (a) Planning and administrative Staff

DIRECTORS of tribal welfare, divisional commissioners and district magistrates shall be in this category,

### (b) The supervisory staff who are expected to guide and direct the field workers

THESE are the project executive officers of the Tribal Development Block, block development officers, and district welfare officers,

# (c) Technical non-field staff above and at the district level

THESE will include deputy directors of agriculture, conservators of forest, superintendents of education, civil suigeons, and executive engineers,

# (d) Technical staff below district level

ASSISTANT engineers, overseers, soil conservation & extension officers, assistant surgeons/medical officers, cpmpounders, agricultural officers, cooperative officers, social education oiganisers, extension officers in rural industries, extension officers in animal husbandry, forest rangers, station house officers,

### (e) Field staff

GRAMsevaks and gram sevikas (village level workere-both male and female), sanitrary inspectors, health visitors, midwives, stockmencum-health supervisors, head constable, forest guards, agricultural assistants.

THE personnel of the non-official voluntary agencies working in tribal area or amongst the tribals may be classified into following categories:

- (a) Office bearers,
- (b) Non-field technical personnel, and

(c) Field technical personal.

STATUTORY oiganisations which function in tribal areas are the panchayats. The office bearers and employees of these institutions also require training.

### **Training Facilities**

FACILITIES for imparting training to various categories of officers for work among the tribal communities exist in the tribal research institutes in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and West Bengal. Tribal orientation and study centres have also been set up in Bihar (Ranchi), Madhya Pradesh (Jabalpur), Orissa (Bhubneshwar) arid Rajasthan (Udaipur) for imparting training to personnel working in the tribal development blocks. As the Shilu Ao Committee Report correctly points out, though the curriculum of these tribal orientation centres lays emphasis on a proper understanding of the life and cultural values of the tribal people and the techniques of working through their institutional framework, a field in which the Tribal research institutes are actively engaged, there is little or no coordination between them and the institutes. This is because of the fact that while the administrative control of tribal orientation and study centres is the responsibility of the Community Development Department, the control of the research institutes rest with the Tribal Welfare Departments. But the authorities of the Department of Community Development maintained that the broad framework for the training to be imparted at the two sets of institutions had been worked out jointly and agreed to by the Department of Community Development and the Department of Social Welfare. Thus, while the tribal orientation centres are responsible for the training of middle level personnel posted in Tribal Development Blocks and undertake a number of other training programmes for official and non-official personnel working in these and other blocks, the tribal research institutes cater to the training requirements of village level workers and certain other functionaries working mainly in Tribal Development Blocks.

BESIDES the above mentioned agencies imparting training to the personnel responsible for tribal development, some others like the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Bombay, has also done commendable work by imparting training to the supervisory officers, namely, those working at and below the district level. The Social Education Organisers Training Centre at Ranchi has also served this cause to an appreciable extent. Some non-official agencies like the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Trust also extends training facilities especially for women field workers such as gram sevikas.

SINCE the average tribal folk are not literate, newer ideas reach them through their village elders whom they look for advice. The tribal leaders, thus, occupy a pivotal role in the transmission of ideas from the outside world and also in interpreting the views of the tribals to the administration. It is very crucial for the success of all developmental programmes that the local tribal leaders should be taken into confidence. Though, the Department of Community Development includes the training of these village elders in its various programmes and tries to accomplish it through holding training camps in tribal villages, but thus is their weakest link. Often, the camps take the form of classroom being run in highly formal way, and thus the impact, if any, melts away. It is also ironical that in some cases the tribal leaders develop vested interests and fail to fulfil their role and responsibilities of acting as healthy and reliable link between their brethens and the administration.

AS POINTED out very aptly by the Dhebar Commission, giving a tnbanDiasTbThTw1idIe~prognmnne-is-very important. An active effort should be made to recruit tribals for some of the jobs at the village or block level. There should not be any great difficulty in recruiting and training a number of tribals for jobs in their own areas which will not require a high educational qualification, namely, teachers in primary schools, midwives and nurses, compounders, forest guards, etc.

PICKING up the thread from Dhebar commission's report commenting on providing the whole programme a 'tribal bias', as pointed out in the preceding paragraph, Srivastava (1981) points out that a training programme based on stereo tape courses with theoretical anthropology, sociology, economics, statistics or stereotype course dealing with development programmes for the general people will not cover the regional or local problems the personnel will have to encounter in implementing any tribal development programme. The will have to be supplemented with practical bias oriented towards the tai^et group, viz. socio-economic development of the tribal areas and the various tribal groups living in various areas. While concluding the present chapter, it seems to be in the fitness of things to quote Grewal (1981) who has very correctly pointed out the desired and required objective of these training programmes. According to him, the training programme should seek to: courses

(i) produce an awareness that administration involves both technical and behavioural aspects of work and is the process by which the best answers to complex situational problems are produced;

- 488\_TRIBAL INDIA
  - (ii) explain the relationship between the administrator and ike government:
  - (iii) help the administrator improve his understanding ofhim self and his role in development activity:
  - (iv) establish concepts of administrative behavior and function: and
  - (v) introduce and develop administrative techniques, both technical and behavioral.

THE success of tribal development programmes is largely conditioned by the approach of the official and non-official agencies implementing them. Hence, their understanding of tribal culture and traditions and appreciation of social, psychological and economic factors alongwith their intellectual conditioning in grappling with the true objectives are most crucial in the process of welfare and development of a large, long neglected segment of Indian society.
