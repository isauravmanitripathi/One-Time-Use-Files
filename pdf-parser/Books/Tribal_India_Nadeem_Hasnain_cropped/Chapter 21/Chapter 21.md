NOT much attention has been devoted to a scientific study of the artistic efforts of the Indian tribes. However, whatever data we have reveal that in these tribes various types of art are present. Generally the "art of primitive peoples runs a wide gamut from technical clumsiness to high skill, from childlike simplicity to confusing complexity, from naturalism and realism to conventionalized abstraction" (Hoebel, 1949). The tribal is essentially a man of the nature, deriving all his traits and ways of living from natural phenomena. To a non-tribal layman most of the objects of tribal art may not look beautiful or artistic. But as a matter of fact, "for the full appreciation of a work of art it should be seen as far as possible in the setting for which it was created" (Leonard Adam, 1949). This is particularly true of primitive art because of its strange and altogether different cultural background. Verrier El win (1973) elaborates this significant point further by saying that the statue of an ancestor or of a deity under African conditions of light, and intended to remain always in the gloom of a shrine or temple, cannot be expected to produce the same effect when it has been removed from its original surroundings and displaced in a glass cabinet in a European room or an Indian room either.

THE art forms of the tribal art are :

(i) plastic art (ii) graphic art, (iii) music art, (iv) art of dancing and (v) oral literature.

MOST of the Indian tribes have all the above art forms and in the present chapter, all these aspects will be discussed in brief. But before discussing the tribal art of India it seems quite appropriate to remark that the primitive art is the most pure, most sincere form of art, partly because it is deeply inspired by religious ideas and spiritual experience, and partly because it is entirely unselfconscious; there are no tricks " which can be acquired by the unworthy, and no technical exercises which can masquerade as works of inspiration.

THE most significant aspect of the art of India's tribal folk is that the art is interwoven with religion and the distinction which is usually drawn between the sacred and the secular by more sophisticated people ceases to exist. Thus, both art and religion "tend to fuse with

each other into a unified whole" (N. K. Bose, 1971). The tribal artist is not ashamed of what might be regarded by others as crude\*. He remains true to the impression which an object has produced upon him, and tries to reproduce it faithfully. Interestingly, the tribal artist may be 'untutored\* but he is not uninitiated.

## Plastic and Graphic Art

UNDER the heading of graphic and plastic art among the Indian tribes, mention may be made of painting, wooden and stone sculpture and statuettes.

SIGNIFICANTLY, as Elwin observed, the worship of idols and images, which has been so potent as source of inspiration in other parts of the world, is weak in tribal India. It is extremely rare to find any representation of the tribal gods. The great tribes ^e Gond, the Santhal, the Bhil, the so-called Naga groups-represent their deities, if they make them at all, by stones, lumps of earth, bits of unshaped wood. Indeed, their shrines are nearly always empty in view of the fact that tribal gods are imagined in essentially anthropomorphic terms. Images are in fact made not to represent the gods but as offerings to the gods. In Bastar for example, the Murias offer at their shrines attractive little brass images of horses, elephants and human figures. Other tribes make offerings of birds, horses and elephants of clay. Besides, the representatives of demons, dummies and other products of fantasy are also artistically produced.

TERRACOTTA animals and the like are also popular with many of the Indian tribes and one can see heaps of terracotta figures in tribal villages under trees. Year after year, the figures go on piling. They may strike an outsider by the monotony of their form or by lack of any arrangement among the offerings. These are no more than tokens of memory, the symbol of an experience through which one has passed.

SOME of the tribal artists are remarkable painters. They paint on walls. The Saoras of Ganjam are almost obsessed by gods, ghosts and ancestors. Since they believe that these unseen things may interfere with the course of their lives, they have developed and elaborate system of sacrifices and actions intended to flatter their vanity. Among such actions is the custom of making paintings on the walls of the houses. These are made in honour of the dead, to drive away disease, to promote the fertility of the crops and on the occasion of certain festivals. Most of the tribal painters acts under the

#### 372\_TRIBAL INDIA

inspiration of a dream. The paintings are of great variety and some ^ of them are extremely striking,

MARRIAGE is another event in their life that has inspired art. In order to avoid evil spirit, baffling patterns are drawn on ground using a variety of colours. Some Central Indian tribes display a riot of colours on earth on such occasions. Besides diagrammatical representation on the ground, beautiful crowns for the bride and groom and a variety of lampstands are also made to decorate the site of marriage in making beautiful heads of deer and other animals. Some other tribes make it on wood. Among the tribes interested in indulging in various artistic activities on the occasion of marriage, Santhals appear to be the most enthusiastic. They are famous for making beautifully decorated palanquins in which bride and groom are carried from house to house.

EL WIN (ibid) while surveying the tribal art concerned with death has provided us very vivid narration. He saw the Marias of Bastar making splendid wooden pillars for the more important of their dead.

THESE are carved with the things that interested the deceased: we see dancers in their finery, women serving rice beer from pots, hunting scenes, shamans in the act of divination. But it is the Phoms and Konyaks of the north eastern region who excel in making grave effigies.

THESE are believed by some anthropologists to provide either temporaiy resting places for the soul of the dead or more permanent receptacles for their soul-essence. The figures are realistically carved with the usual tattoo marks and ornaments of the dead person, and are placed in little shrines which are decorated with spears and other weapons. But while on the one hand death encourages art, on the other it is its enemy not only because its relentless fingers stifle the creative purpose forever, but because some tribes believe that anything beautiful that a man has made must perish with his body. Thus, the Santhals bury or cremate any fine piece of carving, a favourite decorated flute or a splendidly ornamented fiddle with the dead. "Many of the tombs of the Chang, Phom and Konyak have the appearance of regular museums. On the bamboo platforms, upon which the corpse is exposed, are hung a great variety of ornaments, pieces of cloth, baskets, weapons, traps, etc. These are allowed to rot in wind and rain and I have often been tempted to remove them and so save them from oblivion. It is a real waste, tragic waste, but even to touch them would be a major breach of a strict taboo" (Elwin).

THE artistic taste of the tribal folk also finds expression in the decoration of their houses, in the clothes they weave and wear, as well as in the simple ornaments with which they decorate their own bodies. Though the range of colours is limited and mostly they are yellow, red, blue, green and deep black but we see a riot of colours even within this limited range.

MOST of the Indian tribes are very fond of tattooing. To the womenfolk of such tribes as Maria and Muria of Bastar, tattooing is like having gold and silver ornaments. They have a wide range of designs, figures, and pictures to select their favourite one and that will also fascinate her lover. Many of the Maria and Muria women have almost all of their body tattooed.

ORNAMENTS present excellent opportunity to the Indian tribal folk to express their artistic creativity. A variety of hairpins and combs made of bamboo and wood are proudly exhibited on their head. Besides, the way they decorate their hair, waist, neck and forehead with flowers, beads and cowries is a feast to the eyes. The Bhils with huge bangles, bronze anklets, necklaces and other jewellery made of white copper, lead, bronze, beads, nuts, straw, grass and silver present a very colourful and attractive look. Ornaments made of wheat straw and grass provide a special type of spring decor of Bhil girls. Various types of head-gears also add charm to a tribal's personality. The tribals of the north eastern region are famous for their beautiful and tastefully decorated head-gears made of feather and fibre. The Oraons make artistic costumes and ornaments from peacock and bhangara feathers. The head-gear of the Bison-Horn Marias of Bastar is a rare artistic piece made of the horns of bison. The scarcity of bison horn has made it all the more valuable and important. 'The cowarie decorations, and peacock feathers artistically tied around it make it artistic and goiBCOus. All these costumes, jewellery, head-gears, hair dressing styles etc., are manifest in almost all their functions, dances and festivals" (b.L. Samar, 1964). The bone decorations done by the Naga and other Manipur tribes, though look a little grotesque, are artistically designed. Since most of the north-eastern tribes live mostly on hunting, the hides and bones left as residue are made use of as decorative pieces for their homes and other places of collective activities. In Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Orissa where flowers grow in abundance they from the principle medium of dress and hair decoration. The tribes of Rajasthan use metallic ornaments made of white copper, bronze and silver.

EVEN hunting implements and weapons of war could not escape the artistic urged of these people. The Naga tribes are very well-known

### 374\_TRIBAL INDIA

for decorating their weapons of war and the human heads they keep as trophy (remnants of the head hunting days) in veiy artistic ways. The hunting implements like the arrow and the bow of the Bhils and other central Indian tribes and the spear of Manipur and other north eastern tribes are kept not as utility implements alone but also decorative article of show value. as

APART from the above mentioned articles, some more items of daily use may also be cited as art pieces. Stools, chairs and cots (wherever they are in use) also come in for decoration through engravings. Basketry and pottery also come in for occasional ornamentation. Totemic flags and emblems too are always products of artistic effort. The Nagas make beautiful wooden drinking mugs and spoons.

## Music, Dance and Oral Literature

MUSIC and dance include types of instrumental and vocal music, and also various types of dances and dance dramas. Oral literature includes folktales, folksongs, riddles, proverbs, myths and common sayings.

MOST of the Indian tribes have evolved one type of collective dance or the other accompanied by music. Karma dance of the Gonds arid the bihu of the north-eastern tribes are very famous. Bhils of Rajasthan are also justly famous for their gauri dance-drama.

AMONG the musical instruments used by Indian tribes mention may be made of drums of various types, pipes, flutes, horns, brass plates, Kartals, Jhahjh, etc. The Maria mradang, the Bhil modal, the Naga khol, the Bhilala dhol and nakkara used in their dances and other ceremonial occasions are also examples of excellent craftmanship. The decorations, paintings and designs done over them by tribals themselves are attractive and fascinating. Other musical instruments like the special type of drum and the pun^ of the Maharashtra Bhils too are known for their musical and artistic value. The gouija of Garasiya tribe of Rajasthan is also worth mentioning. It is temporarily made with ordinaiy clay for use in their famous gangore festival. It is artistically decorated with conch shells and cowries and is taken in procession followed by dancing and singing.

D.N. MAJUMDAR (1967) observes that in the myths and folktales heard in the tribal villages of the countiy is enshrined, in a poetic and imaginative garb, the philosophy of these simple folks. Eveiy tribe has several myths, often mutually contradictoiy about its origin. In these myths gods and men live together in an amoral world. But

#### TRIBALIND1A\_375

there are other types of myths the sole function of which is to compel obedience to some customs by pointing out how so and so was punished by the super-natural powers for such and such offences. The world of vegetation, the animal kingdom and man's dependence on them supply the subject matter for many myths current among the Indian tribes. Folktales are frankly imaginative and more entertaining than awe inspiring. In fact, their main functions appear to be entertainment. They are short like our short stories and long like our novels. They deal with human situations in which suspense, ghosts, heroes and heroines have their due place.

POETRY, dramatic stories and music generally go together. Ail kinds of poetry have been found among the Indian tribes, they have lullabies, nonsense rhyms, devotional songs, love lyrics, satiric verses and epic ballads. They have seasonal songs, marriage songs, dance songs, hunting songs, incantations, and funeral chants. Songs are sung in solos, in duets and also in choruses. Riddles, proverbs and sayings also are common among all tribes.

MAJUMDAR (ibid) rightly laments that there is so much in the everyday life of the Indian folk that requires to be changed; there is so much in it that has to be preserved and nourished for the good of the country as a whole, and that includes tribal art in all its forms. Verrier Elwin (1973), too, sadly comments that to study tribal art in modem India is a melanchol task. The march of civilization, for some reasons, has a paralysing effect on tribal people. The tribal people of India conquer the sorrows of daily life by discovering their own soul in the depth of religious and artistic experiences. As such, tribal art is everyone's art but this everyone's art has started fast losing its richness in the bewildering mosaic of the fast marching industrial civilization.
