## ROLE OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN TRIBAL DEVELOPMENT

Chapter 33

NEXT to Africa, India has the largest concentration of tribal population, but the problem of tribal welfare or tribal development in India is not an old phenomenon. A ^policy' for the development of its tribal population was adopted in India for the first time after independence. The object of this approach was to Mevel up\* the administrators, social scientists; especially anthropologists, social workers and a host of voluntary agencies in the formulation and implementation of this massive plan. The involvement of anthropologists and use of anthropology in tribal welfare and development programmes in not sudden. It took decades to appreciate the knowledge of anthropology for use in practical purposes. Let us briefly review this important development.

MOST of the tribal population spread in different regions of India remained isolated till 1750 or so, when administrative officers, missionaries, social workers and others started taking keen interest in them for one reason or the other. They tried to 'help\* (tribal people) in their own respective ways. Their objectives and orientations were different and hence they visualised varied approaches to the tribal problems. "The importance of knowledge of anthropology for efficient administration was, perhaps, first realised as early as 1807 when the Court of Directors of East India Company made a formal decision that 'such knowledge Would be of great use in the future of administration of the countiy\*. To this effect. Dr. Francis Buchnon was appointed by the Governor General-in-Council to undertake an ethnographic survey to enquire into the conditions of the inhabitants of Bengal and their religion'\* (Vidyarthi, 1968). Since then several anthropologically oriented administrative officers like Risley, Thurston, Dalton, Grigson, Gurdon and others were deputed by the British Government to prepare handbooks, gazetteers, monographs, etc. on tribes and castes of India. Thus, quite a lot of ethnographic literature was produced within a short time. Its scientific value should not be questioned severely because it was the result of some pioneering efforts made by the earliest ethnographers. These writings contained general information about land and people and were more in the nature of general description. However, the first problemoriented work came out only in 1931 when J.H. Hutton put forward his views regarding the evil effects of contact on the tribal people. He suggested "self-governing tribal areas with free power of selfdetermination." S.C. Roy made similar reports regarding the tribes of Bihar. Now a 'fiil-fledged\* anthropologist D.N. Majumdar did field work among the Hos. He also came out with his findings, published in 1937, that the Hos had undergone much degeneration since they were studied\* by Dalton in 1879. He also studied Korwas and came out with shocking conclusions regarding their plight.

HOWEVER, Verrier Elwin's monumental monograph on Baigas of Central Provinces may be regarded as the first work in which anthropological view about the future of the tribes found vocal, bold and explicit expression. He lamented that Baigas were iiiade a victim of "over hasty and unregulated process of uplift and civilization". As a remedial measure, he suggested the creation of a sort of National Park\* in which Baigas and the like could be accommodated. He also suggested that "administration was to be so adjusted as to allow the tribesmen to live their life with utmost possible happiness and freedom and where missionaries of any sort were not to be allowed to break the tribal life\*\*. This work was followed by another entitled "Loss of Nerve" (1941) which contained a stronger tone in favour of isolationism\*. Since Elwin\*s personality carried a lot of weight, he was regarded as the major spokesman of the majority of anthropologists of his time and thus anthropologists were labelled as 'isolationists\*, 'revivalists\*, 'no-changers\*, 'status-quoists\* by the social workers aligned with the Indian National Congress Party. Besides Elwin, D.N. Majumdar, S.C. Dube, N.K. Bose, L.P. Vidyarthi and others contributed quite considerably to the writings on tribes and tribal development.

THE social workers and politicians led by A.V. Thakkar, popularly known as "Thakkar Bapa\*\* had different views the views of social worker. They exploited the situation and branded\* the entire community of anthropologists as 'isolationists\* despite the fact that majority of anthropologists, while considering the ill effects of unregulated invasion of non-tribal people on the tribal areas, were not prepared to go to the extent of accepting the views of Elwin in go to. They just wanted that tribals should not be exploited and degenerated in the name of 'progress\*, 'civilization\* and 'development\*. But the damage had been done and allegations, half truths and insinuations were hurled at anthropology and anthropologists. While delivering R.R. Kale Memorial Lectures in 1941, Thakkar Bapa accused anthropologists of being selfish and that

is why they wanted to "keep these people confined to and isolated in their inaccessible hills and jungles, something like keeping them in a glass ease of a museum for the curiosity of purely academic persons". To him, ^separatism\* fend Msolationism\* seemed to be dangerous theories as they stuck at the root of national solidarity. He pleaded total assimilation of tribals and taking the posture of a typical social worker simplified the tribal problems into: (1) poverty, (2) illiteracy, (3) lack of communication, (4) ill health, (5) defects in administration, and (6) lack of leadership.

### After Independence

"ALL these controversies that took place in the thirties and forties of the present centuiy had a very devastating effect on the growth of applied anthropology in India. When India became independent in ^ 947, and the attention of the Government towards tribal welfare activities increased, the claims of anthropologists and experts on tribal problems were not taken into consideration at all. Their stand regaiding tribal problems continued to be condemned at governmental level and they were not needed for anthropological research and advice by the Government" (Vidyarthi, ibid). This situation gave rise to a trend that was not at all beneficial for the tribal people. The social workers and politicians who were out to 'civilize' them at any cost acquired the role of experts on tribal problems. They found their own colleagues and partymen at the helm of governmental affairs and thus, there was nobody to prevent them from doing anything they liked. In this way, social workers assumed the roles of both semi-officials and scientists. They held administrative posts for tribal welfare schemes and represented the government on national and international conferences on tribal problems. The anthropologists stood condemned and ignored. They were not needed anywhere except in museum and survey work.

THIS state of affairs continued till about 1960 but anthropologists were not sitting idle licking their wounds. Silently, they were developing newer insights, perceptions and concepts. They came out with veiy useful and pragmatic policies and programmes of tribal development in the changed socio-political climate. Even Elwin who took an extreme position also modified his views and began to emphasise on the need for 'careful planning' and 'planned acculturation'. But the old sharp differences of opinion prohibition, medium of instruction, etc., were not resolved. on

AFTER seeing the disastrous results of wrong approaches and performance of non-anthropologists, the government realised that it non-

had done unjustice to the real experts, the anthropologists. It gave impetus to the feeling that social workers, administrators and anthropologists should work in close harmony with each other, '^is trend started reflecting in the composition of newly constituted fribal research institutes, tribes advisory councils and v^ous committees of Planning Commission. Although,, anthropologists accepted this olive branch, but it hardly means tha't they are ready to accept "to civilise the savage approach" of social workers and administrators. Any approach devoid of values is not acceptable to anthropologists working on tribal problems and spirit of parentalism cannot be allowed to dominate over the right of self-determination.

## Anthropology Grappling with New Trends in Tribal Development

BEFORE dealing with the changed role of anthropology in tribal development, it will be quite appropriate to quote Kroeber (1956) who put forward beautifully the role of anthropology as compared with roles of other disciplines in understanding humanity and implementing programmes for its betterment:

"7/ is evident that anthropology, however spet^ific it may often be in dealing with the data-aims, is ultimately a co-ordinating science somewhat as a legitimate holding corporation coordinates constituent companies. We anthropologist does, or prices, credit and banking as well as economist, or heredity with the fullness of the genetic biologist. But we face what these more intensive scholars only glance at intermittently and tangentially, if at all: try to understand some measure how Chinese civilization and economies and human heredity, and some dozens of other highly developed special bodies of knowledge, do indeed interrelate in being all parts of man ftowing out of man. centered in, him, products of him". to

IF ANTHROPOLOGY, as an integrated science of man, deals 'holistically' both with the biological and cultural aspects of man, its applied or practical branch is equally comprehensive and strives to meet the need of mankind by planning for an allround development of human society.

COMMENTING on the role of anthropology in identifying the problems and suggesting remedial measures for the human society especially simple societies, George Foster puts forward three most important merits of anthropology:

500 \_TRIBAL INDIA

- (i) Anthropology as a point of view;
- (ii) As a storehouse or treasure of factual informations;
- (Hi) It's distinct research methodology.

THE holistic approach, belief in cultural relativism and a strong humanitarian tradition put anthropology on a different pedestal By virtue of Its vast experience of field work for more than 150 yeare among the simple societies, anthropologists have accumulated a vast treasure of factual information. The comparative method or crosscultural comparison has added an important dimension to such studies. Among the tools of data collection utilised by the anthropologists 'participant observation\* is a unique way of getting the most reliable information described by many as 'insiders view\* Thus, anthropology equipped with these distinct features and looking at development\* through a different angle, may play a unique role in tribal development.

THERE is difference in the way an administrator looks at the tribal and the way the tribal looks at the world. Though, anthropologists lacks practical experience of administration and are sometimes unable to translate their concepts into simple language for the benefit of administrators, yet by virtue of their training in anthropology, they understand the important\* of qualitative data in any programme for development which others sadly lack. Development means "growth\*\* plus "change\*\*. It involves both the material and the human factors. The school of thought which subscribes almost wholly to what has come to be known as "growthmanship\*\* is not acceptable to anthropologist, as opined by Vidyarthi (1981). They believe that a given number of material inputs, when assembled in certain proportions, yield the desired output measurable in quantified indicators such as rate of growth, national income, per capita income etc. They seem to be under the impression that growth, as assessed m terms of such gross indicators, is a value in itself. The non-material factors constitute for them but a context; social service a mere infrastructures; Md social change, a by-product of such growth. To an anthropologist such a mechanical concept of growth is not acceptable, and he has consistently emphasised that socio-cultural factors are an integral part of the dynamics of growth ar.d that social change is not simply a non-functional or a dysfunctional side effect of development planning (ibid).

IN THIS context the concept of development has to be defined and operated in terms of the cultural background of the community concerned. While striving for the development of a group or an area,

due emphasis has to be given to their traditional values and historical experiences. However, a practitioner of anthropology enjoys certain advantages over others who deal with the tribals. His residence for a period of time among them is paralleled only by missionaries or a few social workers. Administrators hardly even find time to spend more than occasional moments among the people for whose welfare or development they are responsible. "Whereas missionaries and social workers think it their task to teach, to change, the anthropologist is there only to learn. This double advantage of the anthropologist-long residence in an area and a concerted effort to learn and understand—qualifies him as the only 'outsider' able to give concrete and thorough recommendations for action" (Edward Jay, 1968). But at the same time, the anthropologist does not claim to prescribe panacea for all evils. He tries to understand the 'insider's view' of the problems and provides concrete and pragmatic recommendations to the government.

ANOTHER point which puts an anthropologist on a different pedestal is that he is not obsessed with 'end' only. For him means are as important as end because he understands it pretty well that wrong and coercive means prove counter-productive in any scheme of tribal development. Various failures in the governmental tribal development schemes bear testimony to this fact. Four decades of tribal development have not produced any satisfactory results. Now most of impartial analysts believe that this failure is due to unrealistic planning, apathetic bureaucracy, neglect of local and felt needs of the people, ignoring their cultural values and non-material indicators.

THIS state of affairs is also due to the fact that administrators have failed to appreciate that anthropologists are the only ones who can guide and advise most effectively in matters concerning tribal people. With their specialized knowledge, deep perception, sympathetic attitude and rigorous field-oriented approach, anthropologists are in a unique position in this respect. It is high time that administrators as 'generalists' and anthropologists as 'specialists' come together to collaborate in a team spirit, to make, tribal development programmes a 'pleasant' success. In this way anthropolo©' can be used to best advantage of the whole society in general and the tribal people in particular.
