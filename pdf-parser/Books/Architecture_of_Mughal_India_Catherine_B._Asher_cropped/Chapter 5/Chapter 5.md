### CHAPTER 5

# SHAH JAHAN AND THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF MUGHAL STYLE

Shah Jahan, Jahangir's third son, emerged victorious in the power struggle that developed after Jahangir's death and assumed the Mughal throne in 1628. His thirty-year reign is dominated by an outward sense of prosperity and stability unmatched even during Akbar's rule. At the same time, almost every aspect of courtly culture became increasingly formalized. Shah Jahan was portrayed as an aloof ideal king. Official histories thus present him as a just leader and staunch upholder of orthodox Islam, but they give little insight into the emperor's personal thoughts. Yet Shah Jahan's unreserved preference for Dara Shukoh, his eldest son, an eclectic mystic thinker, suggests other aspects of this ruler's character never alluded to in court histories. The painted image of Shah Jahan parallels the literary one. The emperor is portrayed in an idealized manner - while he ages over time, his features remain flawless. His inner character is never revealed. Rather, his role as semi-divine king of the world, a play on his name, is the focus of each portrait. His face is always surrounded by a halo, as in late representations of Jahangir. In some of these illustrations the metaphoric nature of the king's semi-divine and just quality is taken so far as to show small angels above his head, often crowning him, while at his feet are the lion and the lamb of peace. Even more than light imagery, paradisical imagery now evolves from verbal to visual forms, particularly in Shah Jahan's architecture.

Best known for his construction of the Taj Mahal, Shah Jahan was the greatest patron of Mughal architecture. The sums expended on his tombs, palaces, hunting pavilions, gardens and entire planned cities is extraordinary even by modern standards. Just as the literary and painted image of Shah Jahan became increasingly ceremonial and formal, so his architecture, much of it meant to serve as an imperial setting, assumed an air of formality unprecedented in earlier Mughal structures. The use of white marble inlaid with stones, noted during the later portion of Jahangir's reign, characterizes much of Shah Jahan's architectural production. His buildings appear increasingly refined, establishing a style that became an Indian classic.

#### SHAH JAHAN'S RULE

The future Shah Jahan, Prince Khurram, was the favorite of his grandfather Akbar and of his own father Jahangir. Schooled by renowned scholars and

religious thinkers, Khurram revealed a quick mind and good memory, although both father and grandfather were disappointed in his shallow mastery of Turki, Babur's native tongue. The prince did, however, excel in the martial arts. Unlike his father, Prince Khurram possessed great military prowess and was responsible for the major victories of Jahangir's reign. It was, for example, Khurram who had waged successful campaigns against Rana Amar Singh of Mewar and in the Deccan. In honor of his success in the Deccan, Jahangir bestowed upon the prince the title Shah Jahan (King of the World).

Jahangir recognized his son's military and administrative capabilities and so treated Shah Jahan as his heir apparent until about 1622. Then Nur Jahan realized that the prince was too independent to carry out her schemes and so convinced the emperor to support Shahriyar, her own son-in-law. Shah Jahan rebelled, establishing himself as an independent ruler in eastern India with Rajmahal as his headquarters. However, within three years, the prince again acknowledged Jahangir's authority.

At the time of Jahangir's death late in 1627, Shah Jahan had active, powerful supporters at court, most notable among them, Asaf Khan. With his help all rivals for the throne were eliminated and early in 1628 Shah Jahan was crowned emperor in the Agra fort. Adopting lofty titles, he proclaimed himself not only the King of the World, but also the Meteor of the Faith, a role he took seriously. He termed himself the Lord of the Auspicious Conjunctions, a title borrowed from Timur, for, like his predecessors, he was proud of his Timurid heritage. He had genealogies painted illustrating his links with Timurid ancestors, and, as we shall see, the Taj Mahal is modeled on Timurid buildings or at least on structures influenced by Timurid architecture.

Under Shah Jahan Islamic orthodoxy increased. For example, like Akbar and Jahangir, Shah Jahan often visited the tomb of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din Chishti in Ajmer. But unlike Akbar, who later abandoned the pilgrimage to Ajmer, and Jahangir, who never returned to the shrine once he left Ajmer as his residence, Shah Jahan paid homage to the saint at Ajmer until the end of his reign. Official histories indicate that the construction of Hindu temples was in some cases forbidden and a few earlier ones were dismantled, leading some to argue that Shah Jahan was intolerant of other religions. Even the percentage of high-ranking Hindu nobles decreased. Thus Islam took on an importance as never before in Mughal India, although it is difficult to say whether Shah Jahan himself was more orthodox than his predecessors.

The empire inherited by Shah Jahan was by early modern standards a stable one; however, unlike his father, Jahangir, Shah Jahan was interested in territorial expansion. The most consuming campaigns were those in the Deccan and in territories to the northwest, including the Timurid homelands of Balkh and beyond. The conquest and consolidation of the Deccan presented problems that continued into the next reign. By the end of his rule, Shah Jahan recognized

that the Mughal conquest of Timurid homelands was not feasible. While events in the Deccan, with the exception of his favorite wife's death there in 1631, had little impact on his architectural patronage, Shah Jahan's frequent journeys to the northwest, including Lahore, Kashmir and Kabul, inspired construction.

Internal rebellions, largely headed by vassal chieftains who wished to assert their independence from the Mughal empire, also disrupted but did not debilitate Shah Jahan's empire. Among the rebels was the successor of Bir Singh Deo, the raja of Bundelkhand. He was adequately subversive that Prince Aurangzeb was forced to intervene. Aurangzeb wrote his father about the palaces of Datia and Orchha, built during Akbar's and Jahangir's reign, and inspired him to visit them. En route, Shah Jahan stopped at Bari, a hunting resort that he came to love and there constructed a palace. While at Orchha, he ordered the destruction of a temple, not an iconoclastic act, but one intended to demonstrate his authority.

In 1657, Shah Jahan became so ill that those around him believed he had little time to live. His four sons - Murad, Shah Shujac , Aurangzeb and Dara Shukoh, the king's favored heir apparent - vied for the crown. Each proclaimed himself emperor, for in the Timurid tradition succession was not based on primogeniture, but on cunning and strength. Shah Jahan recovered fully within a month, but the war of succession already was well under way. Prince Aurangzeb emerged victorious, and to insure his position he had his brothers and their sons imprisoned or murdered. Proclaiming his father incompetent to rule, Aurangzeb declared himself Mughal emperor in 1658. Shah Jahan survived for another seven years, imprisoned inside the Agra fort in one of his own palaces that overlooked his most famous creation, the Taj Mahal. Dying in 1666, Shah Jahan was buried there next to his wife.

### SHAH JAHAN S PATRONAGE

#### *Shah Jahan's patronage as a prince*

By 1628, when Shah Jahan ascended the throne, he already had shown considerable interest in the construction of architecture and gardens. By the age of sixteen, the future Shah Jahan had built quarters that greatly impressed Jahangir inside Babur's Kabul fort,<sup>1</sup> and redesigned buildings inside the Agra fort. Also while a prince, Shah Jahan built the Shahi Bagh in Ahmadabad (Plates 74 and 75), a building characteristic of Jahangir's time. After forcing the Udaipur rana to submit to Mughal authority, he constructed buildings on a hill in Udaipur in

<sup>1</sup>  *Tuzuk,* 1: 115; Muhammad Salih Kanbo,  *cAmal-i Salih,* 3 vols. (Lahore, 1967), 1: 37-39. Henceforth cited as Kanbo.

1613.2 The prince's dwelling was near the summit. Below it the nobles built their own houses, the higher their rank, the closer to the imperial seat. Thus, early in his career, Shah Jahan revealed an interest in the organization of an entire imperial entourage. Near Burhanpur in the Deccan Shah Jahan built a fine hunting resort on an artificial lake he created by adding a second dam to one constructed before his time.3 Even earlier he had commenced construction of the renowned Shalimar garden in Kashmir. Shah Jahan deeply loved Shalimar garden and in 1634, after his coronation, further embellished the site.

### *Imperial tombs in Lahore*

Several events that occurred around the time of Shah Jahan's coronation relate directly to his subsequent patronage of architecture. These include the construction of Jahangir's tomb, a vow to construct a mosque at the shrine of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din Chishti in Ajmer, and finally an order to build the Public Audience Halls at the Lahore and Agra forts. Shah Jahan's construction at the Ajmer shrine and at the forts is described in detail by contemporary historians. By contrast, Jahangir's tomb is scarcely mentioned. Lahauri, Shah Jahan's official chronicler during the part of his reign when the tomb was built, does not discuss its construction but only mentions its forecourt, while Kanbo, a contemporary historian, describes the tomb and notes that it took ten years to build. Compared to the lengthy descriptions of other imperial projects, the brief reference to Jahangir's tomb suggests that the tension between father and son was never fully resolved in Shah Jahan's mind. It also suggests that Shah Jahan had little personal involvement in its planning and execution, unlike many of his other architectural projects.

Jahangir died in Rajauri while en route from Lahore to Kashmir. Because the terrain there was unsuitable for a large mausoleum, his body was carried to Lahore and buried in Nur Jahan's garden on the banks of the Ravi. The mausoleum (Plate 103), centered in a *char bagh* covering 55 acres, is entered through large gates on the north and south. The southern gate, today serving as the tomb's main entrance, is faced with red Sikri sandstone and profusely inlaid with white marble, recalling the less elaborate gates at I<sup>c</sup> timad al-Daula's 1626-28 tomb in Agra.

The mausoleum today consists of a single-storied platform about 84 meters square. At each corner is a towering minaret. Like the entrance gates, the tomb's red sandstone surface is decorated with white inlay depicting vessels and flower vases. Chevron patterns in white and pink stone embellish the minarets. The crypt is within the platform, reached by long corridors that

> *2* Kanbo, 1: 60-61. 3 Kanbo, i: 328.

![](_page_4_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 103. Jahangir's tomb, Lahore

extend from each of the four sides. It contains the marble cenotaph inlaid with black in lettering giving the year of Jahangir's death and the ninety-nine names of God. Floral arabesques cover the top of the platform upon which the cenotaph rests. This cenotaph thus is similar to the one at the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal, known as the Taj Mahal and built at the same time.

While the tomb today has no second story, originally marble screens enclosed a second cenotaph. The platform atop the large square first story still exists; even in the nineteenth century there were regularly placed oblong indentations for the placement of posts, and marks on the platform indicated that there had been a trellised screen. Some believe that this screened enclosure was surmounted by a roof, like that at I<sup>c</sup> timad al-Daula's tomb (Plate 71). However, Jahangir, before dying, had requested a tomb that would be open to the air, like Babur's, so that it could be directly exposed to God's mercy. Kanbo, who lived in Lahore and doubtless had seen the tomb, confirms that the cenotaph was uncovered.

Just west of the *char bagh* containing the mausoleum is a large rectangular enclosure wall that was completed in 1637. According to Lahauri, this quadrangle, today known as the Akbari Serai, served as a forecourt *(chowk-i jilo khana)* to the tomb. It was here that horses, weapons and other items were left before their owners went to pay homage to the deceased king. Thus, during the Mughal period, this quadrangle must have served as the main entrance. On the

quadrangle's west wall is a single-aisled three-bayed mosque. Its central portal, considerably higher than the flanking ones, as well as the exaggerated height of the three entrance arches, give the mosque an archaic appearance, recalling the Akbar-period mosque at Ajmer (Plate 40) more than contemporary imperial mosques, for example, Shah Jahan's mosque at the Ajmer shrine (Plate 105). No part of this mosque at the tomb shows the elegance generally associated with Shah Jahan's architecture, suggesting that he paid no more personal attention to its form than he did to other parts of Jahangir's tomb.

West of the tomb's forecourt a tomb was built on Shah Jahan's order for Nur Jahan's brother, Asaf Khan, who died in 1641.4 Asaf Khan's lineage was impeccable. Not only was he Nur Jahan's brother and the father of Shah Jahan's favorite wife, but also he was the emperor's closest adviser. Today only the brick shell of his octagonal tomb remains. The white marble that had been ordered for the dome and interior have been stripped away. The recessed entrance arches, however, bear multi-colored glazed tiles.

Although not constructed by Shah Jahan, the former empress, Nur Jahan, built her own tomb in close proximity to Jahangir's. She died in 1645, having survived her husband, Jahangir, by eighteen years. Despite the generous yearly allowance Shah Jahan granted to Nur Jahan, the relationship between this once formidable queen and Shah Jahan remained strained. Her tomb was modeled closely on the mausolea of her father and husband. The building is pierced by seven arched openings on each side. Today there is no second story, but it probably consisted of a roofless screened enclosure. Stripped of its original red sandstone and white marble facing, the tomb recently has been restored.

### *Ajmer:* dargah *and city*

Ajmer and its premier shrine had special significance for Shah Jahan, as it had for his Mughal predecessors. It was here that the prince Shah Jahan's victory over the rana of Mewar was celebrated. That victory inspired patronage of buildings, including work at the shrine of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din Chishti and the imperial residence.

In January, 1628 Shah Jahan encamped in Jahangir's palace on the Ana Sagar, which then consisted of a garden and a marble building. Shah Jahan then must have ordered extra buildings, for when he visited Ajmer next in December 1636 he saw his own newly constructed additions. Among these was a ceremonial viewing balcony *(jharoka-i daulat kbana khass o camm),* part of the Public Audience Hall.

While virtually nothing remains of Jahangir's garden and structures on the banks of the Ana Sagar, several white marble pavilions built by Shah Jahan on

#### 4 Kanbo, 11: 280-90.

![](_page_6_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 104. Pavilions on Ana Sagar, Ajmer

the lake's stone embankment do survive. These structures, known today as *baradaris,* were part of Shah Jahan's palace at Ajmer, considerably more refined and elegant than any of Jahangir's buildings there.

The buildings represent only a small portion of the original complex. Only four of these white marble pavilions, all trabeated structures, are still standing. A fifth has been dismantled, but was distinct from the others. These five pavilions almost certainly were intended for imperial use, since Mughal palace buildings overlooking water had an exclusively imperial function, while those structures increasingly distant from the shore - none of which remain at the Ana Sagar palace - were intended for others in the royal retinue. Probably the Private Audience Hall was located in close proximity to the shore, but the Public Audience Hall and its ceremonial viewing balcony, mentioned in contemporary texts, was probably located in a separate quadrangle, away from the structures intended exclusively for imperial use.

The two pavilions furthest south (Plate 104), similar in appearance, face each other and were conceived together. These trabeated structures are supported by faceted columns with multi-lobed brackets all carved in white marble. They are more refined versions of sandstone buildings constructed by Akbar and Jahangir (Plates 28, 59, 63 and 64). The other two pavilions are rather different, for one opens toward the lake and the other onto the embankment. The pillars

![](_page_7_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 105. Jamic mosque, Ajmer

of the second pavilion divide it into two distinct concentric spaces, recalling the plan of buildings that Akbar had designed specifically for his own use.

It was the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque (Plate 105), built within the famed Chishti *dargah* to the west of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din's tomb, that Shah Jahan himself felt to be his most significant act of patronage in Ajmer. Constructed entirely of white marble, quarried in nearby Makrana, this mosque remains even today the finest building at the shrine. A rectangular structure measuring 45 by 7.5 meters, the mosque is divided into two aisles by slender pillars. The central mihrab (Plate 106) is a deeply recessed tri-partite arched niche with stellate and net vaulting. Its fine appearance inspired later works in the city (Plate 137).

The east facade consists of eleven equal-sized arched openings supported on slender piers. These are not true arches, but brackets that meet at the center. This is not a new technique but one seen earlier on Akbar's Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque at Fatehpur Sikri (Plate 25). The smooth flowing lines of these entrance arches combined with the white marble give the structure a sophisticated yet pristine appearance often associated with the classicism of Shah Jahan's age. The mosque's appearance foreshadows the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque Shah Jahan built in 1653 inside the Agra fort (Plate 115).

Beneath the eaves on the mosque's east facade is a lengthy Persian inscription that gives the date of completion, 1637-38. In addition it states that Shah Jahan,

![](_page_8_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 106. Mihrab, Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque, Ajmer

when a prince, had resolved to build a mosque at the shrine of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din Chishti in thanksgiving for his second victory over the rana of Mewar in 1615. Because of his devotion to this esteemed saint, the inscription continues, Shah Jahan ordered the construction of a mosque compatible with the tomb's design.5 The mosque was built without a dome, insuring that the saint's tomb remained the shrine's dominant building.

The inscription further states that Shah Jahan ordered the mosque since there was none aligned with the mausoleum. The mosque's location thus would allow Shah Jahan during prayer to be positioned auspiciously between the qibla of the mosque and the saint's tomb. Finally, the imagery used throughout the inscription compares the mosque to the Kaaba m Mecca, the most sacred monument in Islam. While such imagery is not innovative, the presence of such a lengthy inscription on a Mughal mosque's facade is unusual and, as we shall see, is the first among several that will become standard on Shah Jahan's religious structures. Like the mosque's appearance, the imagery of its inscription anticipates that used in the epigraph of the Agra fort's Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque.

#### 5 Kanbo, 1: 182-83.

Although the orders for this mosque were issued in January 1628, shortly before Shah Jahan ascended the throne, it took about nine years to complete. This can be explained by the death of Shah Jahan's favorite wife in 1631 and the subsequent construction of her tomb, the Taj Mahal, which diverted resources and energy. The mosque's inscription is dated 1637-38, but most of the structure must have been completed by the time of the king's visit in December, 1636.6 At that time, Shah Jahan approached the shrine on foot, as his father and grandfather had done earlier, distributing large sums of money. Shah Jahan visited the shrine two more times. One was in 1643, when he ordered the preparation of food for the poor in the enormous caldrons, or *, given to the* shrine by his father, Jahangir. His last visit was in 1654, when he paid homage to the saint on three separate occasions, always approaching the shrine on foot. In that year, he ordered the construction of a large gateway for the shrine to commemorate his subjugation of a troublesome raja.<sup>7</sup> The gate was completed one year later, in 1655. Visible from the road, it serves as the first entrance into the shrine, in front of the much taller gate built earlier. This gate is marked by a pointed ogee arch in the high central *pishtag*, conforming to the gate which looms above.

### The renovation of palace and city

Shah Jahan constructed and renovated forts throughout his reign. For example, he continued to build at the Agra fort long after he shifted his capital to Delhi. However, most of the construction at his Lahore and Agra forts was done in about the first decade of his rule. By contrast, his entire Delhi (Shahjahanabad) fort was executed after 1639. All three of these major projects have striking similarities reflecting continuing Mughal practice. Perhaps the most notable was placing imperial chambers at the fort's far end overlooking a river. This practice was established certainly by Akbar's reign and probably as early as Babur's. Although the Agra and Lahore forts were constructed concurrently, they each have individual personalities and merit separate discussion.

Shortly after his accession, Shah Jahan ordered renovations at the Agra and Lahore forts, then the two most important ones. These are but two examples of Shah Jahan's continual effort to improve existing fortified palaces. In addition new buildings were added to Akbar's and Jahangir's structures in the Gwalior fort,<sup>8</sup> but it was little used by the king and served primarily, as it had earlier, as an important prison. The Kabul fort was Shah Jahan's residence during the unsuccessful campaigns to consolidate territory originally part of the Timurid

homeland. The emperor's commitment of a half million rupees for work there in 1646 included the construction of several buildings for ceremonial and administrative use, though none of them remains.<sup>9</sup> An identical amount was expended for strengthening the fort of Qandahar between 1648 and 1653 under the supervision of cAli Mardan Khan. Improvement here was to prevent the fort's capture by the Safavids.10

### *Lahore*

Lahore remained the most important Mughal city after Agra until 1648, when the new imperial capital, Shahjahanabad, surpassed them both. Shah Jahan's additions to the Lahore fort commenced in 1628, the year of his coronation, continuing through 1645. Here, as elsewhere, he was personally involved in establishing the forms for his architecture. He first ordered a Chehil Sutun, or forty-pillared Public Audience Hall. Until its construction, cloth canopies had protected courtiers from the elements when paying homage to the emperor. Although this hall is similar to a better preserved one built concurrently at the Agra fort, it is less elaborate.

About the time Shah Jahan built the Lahore fort's Public Audience Hall, he completed the courtyard containing a tower then known as the Shah Burj, today called the Musamman Burj. It had been commenced under Jahangir, but Shah Jahan was dissatisfied with the appearance of this tower, situated at the fort's northwest corner. Asaf Khan, Shah Jahan's father-in-law and the brother of Nur Jahan, was assigned to oversee the reconstruction, for he more than any other noble understood the emperor's taste. Asaf Khan presented the emperor with several plans, and Shah Jahan himself made the final decision, underscoring the personal role that this fifth Mughal emperor usually played in the development of his own architecture.

The entrance to the Shah Burj quadrangle, known today as the Elephant gate, is a large tile-covered brick structure. It was completed in 1631-32 by cAbd al-Karim, also known as Ma<sup>c</sup> mur Khan, who had designed the Lahore fort's Daulat Khana-i Jahangiri in 1617. The same architect also was probably responsible for the exterior tiled walls built largely in Jahangir's reign adjacent to this gate (Plate 61). This would explain the stylistic homogeneity.

The Shah Burj originally overlooked the river, whose course now has changed. Its white marble buildings, like their counterparts at Shah Jahan's palaces elsewhere, overlook the water and were reserved for the emperor and his family. Among the most impressive is the Shish Mahal (Plate 107). This name is a modern one, deriving from the mirrors, known in Mughal texts as Aleppo glass, that are inlaid into the walls and on the ceiling, thus creating a shimmering effect. Such chambers were even more impressive when filled with

> 9 Kanbo, 11: 392, 419. l0 Kanbo, in: 61-62.

![](_page_11_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 107. Pavilion within the Shah Burj, known today as the Shish Mahal, Lahore fort, Lahore

the lighted lamps so often mentioned in contemporary texts. The central portion of this pavilion's facade is composed of five cusped marble arches supported on faceted double marble pillars whose bases are inlaid with precious stones. This and a similar pavilion erected about the same time in the Agra fort indicates the emperor's predilection for highly ornate personal chambers.

A small rectangular marble pavilion, known today as the Naulakha (Plate 108), is on the west side of the quadrangle. This exquisitely carved marble building inlaid with stones is generally considered Shah Jahan's, but it may be a later addition. Originally it was covered by a deeply curved sloping roof. Such sloping roofs *{bangala)* were derived in part from the indigenous tradition of Bengal, where Shah Jahan as a rebel prince had spent much time, and in part from the baldachin coverings seen in European illustrations, associated during his reign with religious and royal images.11 These curved roofs were first used in Mughal architecture by Shah Jahan and are associated with imperial

![](_page_12_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 108. Pavilion within the Shah Burj, known today as the Naulakha, Lahore fort, Lahore

presence. Probably this roof, like similar ones in the Agra fort, was of gilded metal (Plate 113). The west facade, overlooking the fortification walls, bears a central arched bay composed of exquisitely carved marble screens; three rectangular windows in the screen possibly served as *the jharoka,* the window through which the king daily presented himself to the public. In the Agra fort is a similar structure constructed about the same time; it is designated by Shah Jahan's court historian as the public viewing window.<sup>12</sup> Enhancing the image of the king's daily appearances at the Naulakha are the glazed tiles illustrating angels leading jinns, Solomonic images of kingship, made of tile mosaic on the spandrels of the arches directly below the openings. This marble pavilion is situated close to the Elephant gate, whose inscription commences with lines that describe Shah Jahan as a Solomon in Grandeur.<sup>13</sup>

Later, in 1645, the emperor visited the Lahore fort, inspecting a new palace that overlooked the river, and, as he did frequently, indicated changes to be made. Although this new palace is not further identified, it was probably the white marble structure today known as the Diwan-i Khass, or Private

Audience Hall. Its interior consists of two concentric rectangular areas. This plan and the use of white marble, as we have seen at Ajmer, suggest that the building was intended for Shah Jahan's own use.

The fort's white marble mosque, known as the Moti or Pearl mosque, is probably the product of Shah Jahan's patronage, although it is not mentioned in any contemporary source. It is less elegant than his mosque at Ajmer, but the cusped arches that meet at acanthus leaf apexes, engaged baluster columns on the east facade, and white marble are all features associated with many of Shah Jahan's buildings. The smooth lines of the interior piers, coupled with the uniformity of the cusped arches, yield a formal crystallized appearance in keeping with the official image of Shah Jahan rendered in imperial chronicles, poetry and paintings.

#### *Agra fort*

Shah Jahan dismantled nearly all the structures that Akbar and Jahangir had built inside the Agra fort. He replaced them with white marble and stuccocovered buildings, all contained in walled quadrangles. With the exception of the mosque known today as the Moti mosque, which was not completed until 1653, Shah Jahan commenced his other structures in the Agra fort as early as 1628, his first regnal year, and completed them by the beginning of 1637, when he first used them for ceremonial purposes. As at Shah Jahan's other palaces, the buildings reserved solely for the emperor are made of white marble and overlook the river, while the others he built, for example the Moti mosque and the Public Audience Hall, are away from the waterfront.

Just as at the Lahore fort, so here in the first year of his accession Shah Jahan ordered a Chehil Sutun (Plate 109) to be placed inside the courtyard of the Public Audience Hall. This flat-roofed rectangular structure, today called a Diwan-i cAmm, is divided into three aisles of ten bays each. Faceted pillars support cusped arches with acanthus leaves in each apex. This is typical of those on much of Shah Jahan's architecture. Constructed of red sandstone, this pavilion is covered with a veneer of highly burnished plaster *(cbuna),* giving it the appearance of white marble.

The east wall of the Audience Hall contains a raised rectangular chamber with three tri-lobed openings (Plate no) that serves as *zjharoka* from which the emperor presented himself to those assembled in the Chehil Sutun. Unlike the nobles' area, covered with a burnished plaster veneer, this area reserved for the emperor is constructed of marble that in many places is richly inlaid with precious stones. The lower portion of the chamber's walls is carved with a row of baluster columns, that is, bulbous looking columns that appear to grow from a pot. This column type, first used in Mughal architecture during Shah Jahan's period, was inspired by European prints owned by the Mughal emperors; in these prints, kings and religious figures are flanked by this sort of

![](_page_14_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 109. Exterior, Chehil Sutun, today known as the Diwan-i cAmm or Public Audience Hall, Agra fort, Agra

column.<sup>14</sup> Since the Mughal baluster columns derive from illustrations in which they flank both royal and religious subjects, they were intended in Shah Jahan's architecture as a reference to his semi-divine nature.

Inside the hall silver balustrades were set up allowing the nobility to stand according to rank. Those who held a rank lower than 200 in the numerical hierarchy designating Mughal nobility stood not in the Chehil Sutun but in the red sandstone arched galleries that lined the perimeter of the huge quadrangle. A European visitor to the Mughal court relates that each noble was ordered to embellish one bay of this surrounding gallery at his own expense. Vying with one another for recognition, they covered the entire gallery with fine brocades and carpets, creating an opulent setting and a lasting memory of the Mughal emperor's power.<sup>15</sup> This, contemporary texts reveal, was the very goal of Shah Jahan, King of the World.

To the east of the Public Audience Hall is a quadrangle now called the Macchi Bhavan, for the storage of treasure. It contains a courtyard lined on three sides by two-storied arched galleries. The upper story's south projecting central bay (Plate 111) was designed as a throne niche whose appearance was enhanced by powerful imagery. It consists of four bulbous baluster columns supporting a rounded baldachin that, like the columns of the nearby Audience Hall, were intended to underscore Shah Jahan's semi-divine character.<sup>16</sup> Beside these structural baluster columns, the baldachin's carving is embellished with relief representations of baluster columns and a sun medallion at the top, thus continuing the long-standing Mughal fascination with sun and light imagery.

According to Lahauri, within this pavilion was Shah Jahan's golden throne, which he likens to the seventh heaven.<sup>17</sup>

On the quadrangle's eastern side, overlooking the river, is a raised white marble platform. At its northern and southern ends are marble pavilions facing one another. The northern one, originally faced with a gallery of inlaid marble pillars, is the royal multi-roomed bath, or *hammam*.<sup>18</sup> Here, in addition to bathing, private conferences were held. The Private Audience Hall (Daulat Khana-i Khass), popularly today called the Diwan-i Khass, is the pavilion at the southern end of the platform. This double-chambered structure is entered through five openings flanked by double pillars supporting cusped arches. Inside is a lengthy Persian inscription dated 1636-37 inlaid in black stone. It compares this room to the highest heavens, while the emperor himself is likened to the sun in the sky. Enhancing this celestial imagery is the ceiling that was once covered with gold and silver like the rays of the sun.

Shah Jahan's private residential quarters, inside another quadrangle, stand on a plinth that overlooks the river. On the north is the octagonal tower known today as the Musamman Burj. At this site Shah Jahan demolished Jahangir's palaces, just as he had done at the Lahore fort, and in their place erected this multi-storied tower whose marble fabric is richly inlaid with precious stones. Adjoining the tower to the west is a small pavilion, known as the Shah Burj, with an exquisitely carved sunken tank in its center (Plate 112). This pavilion,

decorated with inlay over most of its marble surface, is perhaps the most ornate building in the entire Agra fort. Its materials and design indicate imperial use, as does its location between the Private Audience Hall and the king's sleeping quarters.

The central pavilion on this platform is Shah Jahan's sleeping quarters, known today as the Khass Mahal, but in contemporary texts as the Aramgah, or place of rest. Flanking it on either side are two almost identical rectangular pavilions within screened enclosures. From the north one (Plate 113), Shah Jahan presented himself to the public outside the fort on the terrain below. This pavilion was surmounted by curved sloping eaves and a *bangala* roof that was gilded. Shah Jahan's official chronicler, Lahauri, notes that when the emperor presented himself to his subjects under this gilt roof, it appeared as if there were two suns.<sup>19</sup> One was light from the morning sun reflected on the roof of this pavilion. The other, Lahauri said, was the emperor himself. Light reflected from the gold roof appeared to crown the king with a halo of the sort often depicted in contemporary paintings and described in literature.

Plate 113. Exterior view of the public viewing pavilion and the Aramgah, Agra Fort, Agra

The nearly identical pavilion on the other side of the Aramgah was the living quarters of Jahan Ara, Shah Jahan's eldest and most devoted daughter. Known as the Begum Sahib, she assumed the responsibilities of the chief queen after the death of her mother, Mumtaz Mahal, in 1631.

There are two small marble mosques inside the fort. Although they are not mentioned in contemporary sources, they were probably completed in the initial phases of Shah Jahan's work there. The more important of them, known today as the Nagina mosque (Plate 114), is approached from the throne chamber of the Public Audience Hall and the Macchi Bhavan, suggesting that it was built as Shah Jahan's personal chapel. Its imperial character is further corroborated by baluster columns, used only on royal buildings at this time. This mosque consists of two aisles divided into six bays by slender piers supporting cusped arches. The parapet and eaves above the central bay are curved, recalling the exterior facade of the pavilion for public presentation near the imperial sleeping chamber and emphasizing its regnal character.

In addition to the small mosques is the fort's Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque, today known as the Moti or Pearl mosque (Plate 115). It was not completed until October 1653, about five years after the imperial residence had shifted to Delhi. After Shah

Plate 114. Mosque, known today as the Nagina mosque, Agra fort, Agra

Jahan saw the mosque in December, 1653, he was so impressed that later he returned to show it to two of his sons. Often considered the most majestic of all Mughal mosques, it is modeled on Shah Jahan's earlier Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque in Ajmer (Plate 105). Each is constructed entirely of white marble; each is divided internally into multi-bayed aisles; and each bears lengthy Persian inscriptions executed in black marble under the eaves. The Agra mosque is, however, situated in a walled enclosure following the Mughal version of a standard four*aiwan* mosque-type, while the Ajmer mosque is not walled, emphasizing direct alignment with the shrine of Muc in al-Din. The Agra mosque has twelve-sided piers, typical of Shah Jahan's later architecture, that support cusped arches. Three high bulbous domes as well as marble *chattris* surmount the roof of the Agra Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque, features not present in the earlier Ajmer mosque, but inspired by Akbar's Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque at Fatehpur Sikri (Plate 25). Both of these structures reflect the tendency for exquisite yet relatively unembellished marble in Shah Jahan's private religious architecture. The Agra fort mosque, more than any other, is a perfectly balanced marriage of form, mass and scale.

The similarity of the inscriptions on the Agra and Ajmer mosques is also striking. Both depict Shah Jahan as a world ruler while at the same time using

![](_page_20_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 115. Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque, today known as the Moti mosque, Agra fort, Agra

paradisical and sacral imagery to describe the mosques' features. The imagery of the Agra mosque's inscription, on the other hand, is more complex, a trend that, as we shall see, is evident in other aspects of Shah Jahan's architecture as well. While some have interpreted the use of heightened paradisical imagery as evidence for Shah Jahan's interest in mysticism, it is surely an elaboration of a long-standing motif in Mughal art.

### *Agra, the city*

As early as 1637 Shah Jahan expressed dissatisfaction with Agra's terrain, hence with its suitability as the imperial capital. Nevertheless, he and his favorite daughter, Jahan Ara, tried to improve the city. Soon after 1637 Shah Jahan constructed a public area *(chowk)* in the shape of a Baghdadi octagon in front of the fort. Its perimeter consisted of small chambers and pillared arcades.20 At the same time, Jahan Ara requested permission to endow a Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque close to the fort. Earlier one had been commenced near the river, but its construction was interrupted so that the Taj Mahal could be completed quickly. Some of the land for Jahan Ara's mosque was crown land, but the rest had to be purchased; in accordance with tradition, it could not be confiscated. The acquisition of this additional land must have taken some time, for, according to inscriptions

> 20 Kanbo, 11: 192-93-

![](_page_21_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 116. Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque, Agra

preserved on the mosque's facade, it was not even commenced until 1643 not completed until 1648.

Jahan Ara's imposing Jamic mosque (Plates 116 and 117) is elevated well above ground level and in Mughal times was visible from a considerable distance. Its large prayer chamber composed mainly of red sandstone and white marble trim is surmounted by three domes embellished with narrow rows of red and white stone. The prayer chamber's east facade is pierced by five entrance arches, the central one within a high *pishtaq.* It recalls the elevation, although not the ornamentation, of Wazir Khan's mosque in Lahore, built in 1634 (Plate 140). Framing the *pishtaq* is a rectangular band of black lettering inlaid into the white marble ground, similar to the bands used on the nearby tomb of Mumtaz Mahal (Plate 131). Here the inscriptions are not Quranic but Persian encomiums, largely praising Shah Jahan and his just rule.21

Quranic inscriptions are inlaid in black stone above a recessed mihrab. The minbar, or pulpit, only found in Jami<sup>c</sup> mosques, is carved with an illustration of this mosque's east facade, a unique feature. The side wings are divided into double aisles of three bays each following the standard pattern of imperial Mughal congregational mosques.

### Sbahjahanabad

Shahjahanabad, literally the abode of Shah Jahan, was not simply a fortified palace, but an entire walled city built as the new Mughal capital. It was constructed at Delhi, the capital of many earlier Islamic dynasties in India. North of the older Mughal nucleus of Delhi, the city was built on a bluff overlooking the Jumna river next to a fortified hillock known during Jahangir's time as

Nurgarh. As early as 1637 Shah Jahan lamented that Agra and Lahore provided inadequate space for the proper observance of court ceremony and processions. Two years later, in 1639, and at an auspiciously chosen moment, the foundations of Shahjahanabad were commenced. The city and palace plans were designed by Ustad Hamid and Ustad Ahmad, neither of whom lived to see the city's completion. Ghairat Khan, governor of Delhi, was appointed supervisor. Later Makramat Khan superseded Ghairat Khan, and it was under him that the bulk of the project was completed in 1648. As with most of his other architectural projects, Shah Jahan was actively involved. He played a role not only in the approval of the design, but also in the on-going construction. The emperor several times visited the site, ordered suitable changes in the plans, and rewarded the workers for their progress. While visiting the site in 1647, the emperor ordered the fort's completion within the following year. Thus two additional architects, cAqil Khan and Aqa Yusuf, were brought in to assist Makramat Khan.

### *The fort and interior palaces*

The fort was dedicated in April, 1648. Its buildings, especially the Public Audience Hall, where much of the celebration took place, were lavishly embellished with textiles embroidered with gold, silver and pearls. Large sums of money, valuable jeweled swords, elephants and other treasures were distributed to members of the royal family and the nobility; many, including Makramat Khan, the supervisor, were awarded an increase in rank.

This fortified palace, today known as Delhi's Red Fort, is irregular in plan, but essentially rectangular in shape (Plate 118). Its red sandstone walls, more than 3 km in circumference, enclose nearly 125 acres of land. The fort was situated on Shahjahanabad's eastern edge, dominating the newly constructed city. On the fort's east, just beyond its walls, lay the Jumna river; beyond the walls on its remaining three sides, the nobles, high-ranking ladies and members of the royal family provided markets, mosques and gardens. For themselves, the nobles constructed mansions that, while smaller in size, mirrored the form and function of the fort's palaces.22

Among the fort's gates, the south or Akbarabad gate (today called the Delhi gate) and the Lahore gate, situated centrally on the west, were the most imposing and led to the city's most important areas. The Akbarabad gate led to Shah Jahan's Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque, situated at the city's highest point, and from a major thoroughfare and market later known as Faiz bazaar. Even more important was the massive red sandstone Lahore gate. It was a focal point, the terminus of Shahjahanabad's main avenue through which a canal ran. On the other side, the Lahore gate was aligned with the palace's Public Audience Hall, in which Shah Jahan's magnificent marble throne was installed. Thus the enthroned emperor faced the heart of his newly established capital, symbolizing his role as a just ruler, who like a father was directly in touch with his subjects. This was a visual manifestation of the Mughal concept of kingship that had been established by Akbar.

Walking through the Lahore gate, one immediately enters a covered twostoried arcade, 70.1 meters long and 8.3 meters wide. On each side, it contains thirty-two arched bays that served as shops, just as they do today. The Agra fort had a similar set of shops, though not inside a covered arcade. The notion of a covered bazaar was stimulated by one Shah Jahan saw in 1646 in Peshawar. That one had been constructed by cAli Mardan Khan, then his highest-ranking noble. Impressed with this Iranian-style covered market, the king ordered that

#### SHAH IAHAN

its plan be sent to Makramat Khan so that such a structure might be included in his new fort of Shahiahanabad.<sup>23</sup>

Although the covered bazaar is well preserved, many other parts of the fort's interior have been altered. Most significantly, walls that divided the fort's interior into a series of quadrangles or courtyards as at the Lahore and Agra forts have been eliminated. Within each of these quadrangles was one of the fort's major marble buildings. Most of these buildings, like the bazaar, remain well preserved.

The covered bazaar leads directly to a building known as the Naqqar Khana, or Drum Room. Here music announcing the arrival of the emperor and other important nobles was played. This two-storied structure in turn leads into the courtyard of the Daulat Khana-i Khass o cAmm, or Public Audience Hall. Today this is known as the Diwan-i Amm. Originally both the Drum Room and Public Audience Hall stood within a courtyard enclosed on all four sides by an arcade.

The Public Audience Hall closely resembles the pillared Chehil Sutun of Shah Jahan's two earlier forts in Agra and Lahore (Plate 109). Within it is Shah Jahan's *iharoka* (Iharoka-i Khass o cAmm), the one from which he presented himself to his nobles (Plate 119). This marble throne, situated in the central bav of the east wall, is composed of a high plinth upon which are carved floral sprays and baluster columns like those on the throne niche in the Public Audience Hall of the Agra fort. At each corner of the platform is a large baluster column that supports a deeply sloping curved roof (*bangala*) or baldachin. The baluster columns and *bangala* covering, inspired by European illustrations of royalty and holy personages, explicitly symbolize Shah Jahan's role as a semi-divine world ruler.

Not only the architectural setting, but also the motifs formed by inlay in the throne itself, underscore this symbolism. The upper portion of the throne, as contemporary chroniclers relate, is "famed for its various colored stones inlaid into the walls ... and adorned with many rare pictures."<sup>24</sup> The emphasis on the word rare here is not hyperbole, for rectangular plaques of black marble are inlaid with rare stones, a technique known as *pietra dura*. These black marble plaques were imported from Italy, doubtless presented to the emperor as a special gift, while the surrounding white marble inlaid with precious stones forming the birds and flowers was Mughal work.

Most of these imported *pietra dura* panels depict single birds and floral motifs; a few that depict lions are probably Indian works, not imported. Different from all the others, the top central panel, an Italian product,

Plate i *ly.Jharoka,* Daulat Khana-i Khass o cAmm, or the Public Audience Hall, Shahjahanabad fort, Delhi

illustrates Orpheus playing his lute and wild animals seated peacefully before him. This panel's central location, directly over the emperor's head, was expressly chosen. Although the Mughals may not have known the meaning of the Orpheus theme, they used it, as earlier they had used other European forms, for their own purposes. Here the combination of Orpheus, the birds, flowers and lions symbolize the throne of Solomon, regarded as the ideal model of just Islamic kingship.<sup>25</sup> The theme is not a new one, for symbols of Solomonic kingship had been seen at the Lahore fort. But here Shah Jahan, King of the World, aligned with his city and subjects, is more specifically than ever before identified as an ideal ruler.

The quadrangle containing the Public Audience Hall is organized much like those in the Lahore and Agra forts. It, too, had a quasi-public function, and was centrally located inside the fort, but away from the river front. Those buildings reserved exclusively for the emperor's private use overlooked the river, as they did at Lahore and Agra. The riverfront pavilions were situated on an elevated plinth and were constructed of white marble. In front of each royal building was a courtyard enclosed by walls on three sides; the building itself served as the courtyard's fourth wall. Thus from within the fort there was no unobstructed view of the buildings reserved for royalty. A similar arrangement earlier was seen in the Agra and Lahore forts, revealing a continuity in the concepts that stand behind the design of Shah Jahan's palace architecture.

The white marble pavilions on the riverfront include imperial offices, residences for the king and his family, gardens and viewing towers. The northernmost riverfront building is the Shah Burj, or King's Tower, originally surmounted by a *chattri,* now missing. This pavilion is south facing and aligned with the other imperial chambers on the riverfront. Its exterior consists of five baluster columns supporting cusped arches. Above the central arch is a curved *bangala* roof suggesting a baldachin covering. According to contemporary sources, only the king and royal children entered this pavilion, underscoring the imperial connotations of this column and roof type.<sup>26</sup> Within the bay of the central arch is a lotus-shaped pool (Plate 120), from which water flows into a channel that originally ran south through the other marble pavilions on the riverfront. The source of the palace's channel, known as the Canal of Paradise (Nahr-i Behisht), was a larger canal 48 km north on the Jumna, excavated originally in the fourteenth century and then re-opened on Shah Jahan's orders.

South of the Shah Burj are two marble buildings, the bath *(hammam)* and the Private Audience Hall (Daulat Khana-i Khass) that were originally part of a single quadrangle. Like their counterparts at the Agra fort, these structures form a single unit. Here the most important state issues were discussed privately, particularly in the baths, where a select few could hold council in a

cool environment during the summer or a heated one in the winter. A threechambered structure, the bath's floors, sunken pools and the walls' dado are made wholly of inlaid marble. The most exquisite room, the central chamber, is marked by a sunken marble tank. This and the entire flooring are inlaid with uncluttered floral and chevron patterns, suggesting a simple yet elegant sophistication of form.

The Private Audience Hall (Plate 121) is south of the bath on the same elevated marble platform. It is a rectangular building measuring 27.5 by 14.3 meters. The chaste elegance of this Private Audience Hall's exterior, marked by marble piers supporting cusped arches, stands in contrast to its ornate interior. Here the marble is embellished with gilt and floral sprays rendered in inlaid jewels. The ceiling was silver, removed by marauders in the late eighteenth century. In this hall stood Shah Jahan's famous gem-encrusted Peacock Throne (Takht-i Shahi), completed by Bebadal Khan. On the walls of the central chamber Shah Jahan had inscribed the oft-quoted verse, "If there be a paradise on earth, this is it, this is it, this is it."<sup>27</sup>

![](_page_29_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 121. Exterior, Daulat Khana-i Khass or Private Audience Hall, Shahjahanabad fort, Delhi

Shah Jahan's residential quarters are adjacent to the Private Audience Hall. This follows the arrangement of his quarters in the Agra and Lahore forts. The Khwabgah or place of sleep, today called the Khass Mahal, is divided into three chambers with a projecting engaged octagonal tower (Burj-i Tila) off the east side that overlooks the river. The tower's arched windows served as the *jbaroka-i darshan,* the one from which he presented himself to the public, similar in appearance to the public viewing balcony at the Agra fort.

The Canal of Paradise that commenced at the Shah Burj flows through the Khwabgah's central chamber beneath an elaborately carved marble screen (Plate 122). Above the screen is a large gilt relief representation of the scales of justice, an allusion to Shah Jahan's perception of his rule. A lengthy Persian inscription records the date work on the fort was commenced and the date the fort was formally inaugurated; it cites the cost and praises the patron, Shah Jahan; and it compares his fort to the mansions of heaven.28 That comparison recalls the inscription on the adjacent Private Audience Hall that relates it to paradise on earth, and it recalls the many visual allusions to paradise in Shah

#### 28 *List,* 1: 16-17.

Plate 122. Scales of justice, Shahjahanabad fort, Delhi

Jahan's buildings. Rarely are the private quarters of other emperors provided such inscriptions, as if Shah Jahan anticipated history looking back on him.

South of the imperial sleeping quarter and viewing balcony were quarters reserved for the women. Among these is a pavilion known today as the Rang Mahal, properly called the Imtiyaz Mahal, that is, the Hall of Distinction. The Canal of Paradise flows through the central aisle of this building, too, and is caught in a centrally placed marble pool carved to resemble an open lotus (Plate 123). In the main chamber twelve-sided piers support cusped arches, a form used in most buildings of the Shahjahanabad fort. Inlay, gilt and polychrome originally covered the marble walls of the Rang Mahal. Thus in the Shahjahanabad palace, one of Shah Jahan's latest architectural projects, the imperial chambers, even more than those at Lahore and Agra, are elaborately embellished. This stands in striking contrast to Shah Jahan's private mosque architecture of nearly this same period.

The fort's remaining areas have been altered greatly. However, descriptions by seventeenth-century visitors indicate the functions of some of them. The fort was clearly a city within a city, not just a series of palaces. That is, all manufactured and processed products needed by the king, the court and its entourage were produced within the fort. The Frenchman Bernier relates that inside the fort were many roads that led to large halls or quadrangles containing *kar khanas,* workshops or centers of production for the goods required within the palace.<sup>29</sup> Here everything was produced from fine paintings, jades, textiles and swords to papers, prepared foods and perfumes. It has been estimated that a total of 57,000 people lived within the walls of this palace fort, the function of each intended to serve the emperor's needs.

#### *Sbahjahanabad: the city and its environs*

The original walls of Shahjahanabad were mud. They quickly fell into disrepair, however, and so in 1653 they were replaced with more permanent walls of red sandstone.<sup>30</sup> The new walls were punctuated with twenty-seven towers and eleven gates enclosing some 6,400 acres; about 400,000 people lived within them. Shahjahanabad was divided into sectors. In them leading court figures built mansions containing, like the imperial palace, residential buildings as well as all units of production needed to serve the extensive household inside. Even Dara Shukoh, the heir apparent, lived along the riverbank outside the palace.

Large bazaars further divided the city. One of the most important was situated due west of the fort's Lahore gate, corresponding with an area today known as Chandni Chowk. Texts indicate that it was composed of uniform pillared galleries on either side of a central canal. It was the prerogative of the leading court ladies to build in and around these markets. Just north of this

market, Jahan Ara Begum constructed a garden known as Sahibabad, used as a serai for the richest merchants. Manucci and Bernier praised its galleries, gardens and canals as among the city's most beautiful.31 Along the Chandni Chowk, not far from the city's Lahore gate, Fatehpuri Begum, probably Shah Jahan's third wife, built a mosque similar to Jahan Ara's Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque in Agra. This large structure, dominating the area, was completed about the same time as most of the palace, around 1650. Nearby Sirhindi Begum, an influential woman of the court, provided a smaller red sandstone mosque.

Akbarabadi Mahal, usually identified as Shah Jahan's first wife, provided a serai and an impressive mosque in a second major market in the south part of the city. The emperor used this mosque for prayer until his own was completed in 1656.32 It no longer exists, but nineteenth-century illustrations indicate that the mosque was similar to contemporary ones built by Fatehpuri Begum and Jahan Ara (Plate 116). This suggests that the uniformity in design for imperially sponsored mosques was intentional, signaling power throughout the city.

Kanbo, m: 90.

The two mosques Shah Jahan provided for the city, similar yet even grander than those of the court ladies, further underscore the notion of a uniform style to represent imperial presence. One was an cIdgah, completed in 1655. It was located outside the city walls, where adequate land was available for the enormous crowd that gathered for the annual celebration of the cId prayers.33 Today it is known as the Purani cIdgah (Old cIdgah), even though little remains of its once impressive red sandstone facade. The second and more important mosque was the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque of Shahjahanabad (Plate 124), located inside the city a short distance from the fort. It is today still considered the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque of Delhi. In September 1650 Shah Jahan issued orders for the commencement of this mosque under the supervision of cAllami Sac id Khan and Fazl Khan. It was completed after six years, in 1656. Shah Jahan called it the Masjid-i Jahannuma, or the World Displaying Mosque, and claimed he modeled it on Akbar's mosque at Fatehpur Sikri (Plates 24 and 2 5),34 although the interior is closer to the Agra Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque's (Plate 117). Years earlier Jahangir had proudly shown the prince Shah Jahan that mosque at Fatehpur Sikri, which clearly remained a symbol of Mughal heritage and pride. Like the Fatehpur Sikri mosque, Shah Jahan's Delhi mosque is appropriately situated on top of a rocky ridge, rendering it visible from a great distance. At the time of its construction, this mosque was the largest in the entire subcontinent; even today it is surpassed in size only by Aurangzeb's Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque in Lahore (Plate 162).

The mosque is approached by steep, high stairs recalling those leading to the Fatehpur Sikri mosque (Plate 23). Its interior court and facade, too, owe considerable debt to the great mosque at Fatehpur Sikri. The prayer chamber, faced with red sandstone and extensive white marble trim, is marked by multiple entrance arches. Three bulbous marble domes crown the mosque and towering minarets flank the south and northeast ends.

Above each entrance to the prayer chamber's side wings are marble panels inlaid with a lengthy black stone Persian inscription written by the calligrapher Nur Allah Ahmad. These verses extol the magnificence of the mosque and lavish praise on Shah Jahan. One interior motif may also serve as a reference to Shah Jahan: the baluster columns that appear in recessed demi-domes on the mosque's side walls (Plate 125) and in the mihrabs. Earlier such columns had been used in places frequented exclusively by the king and his family, but here they appear on the mosque intended for Shahjahanabad's entire population. While Shah Jahan performed his prayers here, others did as well. The pillars then possibly serve as a reference to the emperor, proclaimed in the mosque's inscription as the "strengthener of the pillars of state ... [and] the promulgator of... faith."<sup>35</sup>

walls; these elicited considerable praise from European travelers. Again the imperial women were responsible for much of this construction. Akbarabadi Mahal, noted for building a mosque and serai within the city, in 1650 also provided a magnificent walled garden, today known as Shalimar Bagh, about 8 km north of the city. Contemporary texts indicate that it was modeled on Shah Jahan's gardens in Lahore and Kashmir that are known today as the Shalimar gardens. Very little remains of this large terraced garden, which Bernier claims was Shah Jahan's country estate. That is probably true, for the layout and baluster columns of the largest remaining pavilion suggest that it was used as a throne room.

Another outstanding garden was provided north of the walled city by Raushan Ara, Shah Jahan's youngest daughter. Concurrent with prolific building activity in the new city about 1650, she commenced this garden and her own tomb (Plate 126). The garden maintains none of its original appearance, and only the tomb among the several structures once there remains.

![](_page_35_Picture_1.jpeg)

Approached by causeways, the pavilion containing her grave is in the midst of a small tank. The uncovered central portion of the pavilion contains Raushan Ara's grave; the surrounding flat-roofed galleries have cusped arches supported on bulbous baluster columns, generally an imperial perquisite during Shah Jahan's reign. Paradoxically, however, her simple cenotaph remains open to the air, indicative of her role as God's mere slave.

## *Palaces for hunting and retreat*

Hunting was sport, but it was also intended to show the emperor's prowess and skill. While hunting could take place anywhere, certain areas renowned for their excellent game were maintained as imperial reserves. At a number of these, Shah Jahan erected permanent palaces and pavilions. By far the best preserved and largest is the hunting estate at Bari.

The Bari palace, not far from Babur's Lotus garden at Dholpur, was completed by 1637. Almost every year thereafter Shah Jahan hunted here for several days. Known in Mughal times as the Lai Mahal, or Red Palace, on

account of its red stone fabric, the lodge is situated on the edge of a lake. Two small walled enclosures, one of them a *hammam,* overlook the lake's north end. A long causeway with *chattris* links these enclosures with a large pavilion on the lake's east. This pavilion is divided into three courtyards with a small *char bagh* in the middle of each. The side courtyards were used by men and women separately. The central one clearly was reserved for imperial use, and contained the very components essential to Mughal court ritual.<sup>36</sup> Centrally placed on this courtyard's east wall is the emperor's *jharoka* or viewing balcony covered with a *bangala* roof (Plate 127).

Surviving palaces at Rupbas and Mahal, not far from Agra, are considerably smaller than the one at Bari, but follow a similar layout, apparently one characteristic of a hunting lodge. Others, however, were less elaborate, for example, one at Sheikhupura (Plate 128) in the Punjab; it was commenced by Jahangir (Plate 68) and in 1634 the complex was partially reconstructed by Shah Jahan. The current appearance of this three-storied octagonal pavilion, situated in the center of a large tank, is the result of Shah Jahan's work. Its overall

appearance is one of refined elegance, with the light stucco veneer appearing to emulate the marble surfaces of Shah Jahan's palace buildings.

In 1653 Shah Jahan ordered the construction of a summer palace at Mukhlispur, about 120 km north of Delhi on the Jumna. He favored the palace and its pavilions, renaming it Faizabad. There he found respite from Delhi's blistering heat; moreover, toward the end of his reign, the palace served as a refuge when plague and cholera infested the imperial capital. Although but a shadow of its former magnificence, this summer retreat featured all the chambers necessary for Mughal court ceremony, administration and daily life.

### *Shah Jahan's gardens*

Shah Jahan had a life-long interest in the construction of superbly well-ordered gardens. Many of these served as the setting for major structural works, for example the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal, better known today as the Taj Mahal, or Jahangir's tomb in Lahore. Palaces also incorporated gardens into their layout. Other gardens, however, were developed independently of tombs and palaces. Structures enhanced these gardens, but they were not the reason for the gardens' existence. Most of the gardens Shah Jahan built or renovated were situated between Agra and Kabul. They thus could double as camps or as an imperial serai along the road to Kashmir and further to Kabul.

In 1634 when Shah Jahan was en route from Agra to Kashmir via Lahore, he

![](_page_38_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 128. Pavilion, Sheikhupura

stopped at a number of gardens, including one in Ambala.<sup>37</sup> Shah Jahan had constructed a garden there when he was still a prince. Upon his accession he gave the garden to Jahan Ara, his eldest and favorite daughter, and ordered that suitable buildings be erected there for the women serving as imperial wetnurses.

Continuing his travels to Kashmir in 1634, Shah Jahan proceeded from Ambala to Sirhind and there pitched camp in the Bagh-i Hafiz Rakhna. It had been initially constructed by Akbar and later renewed under Jahangir. During this visit Shah Jahan ordered Diyanat Khan, the *faujdar* (law and order official) of Sirhind, to add several structures including private quarters, an audience hall, a viewing balcony and terraced platforms on the banks of the garden's tank. These buildings, completed in 1635, were visited by Shah Jahan at that time. The garden, today known as the cAmm Khass Bagh, was divided into four sections, one for fruit trees, another for flowers, the third for vegetables and the fourth for the royal palace. Several structures there retain the imprint of Shah Jahan's patronage. The most notable of these is a two-storied building with a curved *bangala* roof, a type associated with imperial structures.

The climate and natural beauty of Kashmir made it the Mughal seat of rest and leisure. Shah Jahan enjoyed the many Mughal gardens there some imperially sponsored, others built by princes and high-ranking officials. Among those he praised were the one at Avantipur constructed by Dara Shukoh, Asaf Khan's Nishat Bagh, and Nur Jahan's Bagh-i Nur Afza, all located within the Srinagar Valley.38 But the most impressive of all are

> 37 Kanbo, 1: 519-20. 3S Kanbo, 11: 27-37, 275-76, 360-61.

Shah Jahan's own gardens in Kashmir, especially the world famous Shalimar garden.

Shalimar garden, situated on the edge of Dal lake in Srinagar and set against the Pir Panjal mountain range, was termed by the Frenchman Bernier the most beautiful of all the gardens.<sup>39</sup> While this site long had served as a garden, its conversion into a terraced Mughal-type garden commenced in 1620, when Jahangir ordered the prince Shah Jahan to dam the stream near Shalimar. In 1634 Shah Jahan further enlarged the garden. It was extended to reach the foot of the mountains, and additional pavilions were then built. Although the older name Shalimar was never abandoned, the Mughals called their new garden the Bagh-i Faiz Bakhsh and Farah Bakhsh, reflecting its division into two parts. The lower terraces, used for imperial audiences, formed the Farah Bakhsh garden (Garden of the Bestower of Pleasure). The higher terraces nearer the mountains, intended for private use, were known as the Faiz Bakhsh (Bestower of Plenty). The garden was approached from Dal lake. According to Bernier, a tree-lined canal led to a small fore-garden that originally fronted Shalimar proper.

The entire garden is divided laterally by a wide stream that commences from the mountains behind and runs the entire length of the garden through the terraced levels. Carved water chutes enhance the effect of rapidly running water. Recessed niches for lamps were carved into the terraced walls over which cascading water fell, illuminating the water at night, for the gardens were used as much then as during the day. Pools with spouting fountains further embellish the garden. In the center of each part of the garden is a black stone pavilion (Plate 129) covered with a tiered roof. Serving as imperial seats, these pavilions stretch across the canal overlooking cascading waterfalls. In the lower garden a centrally placed black platform, serving as the imperial throne, is situated across the water between bracketed pillars. Shah Jahan's Shalimar garden epitomizes the long-standing Mughal love of architectural setting within ordered nature.

Although the most famous Shalimar garden is the one in Kashmir, another Shalimar, also known in contemporary times as the Bagh-i Faiz Bakhsh and Farah Bakhsh, was constructed by Shah Jahan in Lahore. In Mughal times, it was on the city's outskirts, though now it is well within modern Lahore. Modeled generally on Shah Jahan's Kashmir Shalimar, it is a large terraced garden, though not situated on a river bank; instead, its water supply derived from a great canal that originated considerably north of Lahore and brought water to this Mughal city. In 1641, Khalil Allah Khan was ordered to commence the garden. A year and a half later it was completed at considerable

expense by the great Mughal engineers cAli Mardan Khan and Mulla cAlam Alahi Tuni.

This garden consists of three terraces divided laterally by a wide canal. The lowest terrace is essentially a square four-part garden of the standard Mughal type. Marble imperial residences and audience halls are located on the second terrace on the edges of the large central tank filled with spouting fountains (Plate 130). One marble platform is even located in the center of the tank and linked to each of the banks by narrow red stone bridges supported on cusped arches. Included in the garden were seats for public audiences, baths inlaid with stones, and residences for the emperor and his daughter. During Shah Jahan's time there were so many buildings that according to contemporary historians tents were not pitched when the imperial camp was in residence. When Shah Jahan visited Lahore, he often stayed here rather than at the imperial residence in the fort.

### *The mausoleum for Mumtaz Mahal (the Taj Mahal)*

Of all Mughal monuments, the renowned Taj Mahal (Plate 131) best represents the continuing imperial fascination with paradisical imagery. It was built as the tomb of Shah Jahan's favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; after his death Shah Jahan

2 0 9

![](_page_41_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 130. Tank, Shalimar garden, Lahore

was interred there as well, as probably he had long intended. While it is often said that Shah Jahan planned to construct for himself a structure similar to the Taj Mahal in black stone across the river, there is no evidence to support this.

The Taj Mahal has become one of the world's best known monuments. This domed white marble structure is situated on a high plinth at the northern end of a four-quartered garden, evoking the gardens of paradise, enclosed within walls measuring 305 by 549 meters. Outside the walls, in an area known as Mumtazabad, were living quarters for attendants, markets, serais and other structures built by local merchants and nobles. The tomb complex and the other imperial structures of Mumtazabad were maintained by the income of thirty villages given specifically for the tomb's support. The name Taj Mahal is unknown in Mughal chronicles, but it is used by contemporary Europeans in India, suggesting that this was the tomb's popular name. In contemporary texts, it is generally called simply the Illumined Tomb (Rauza-i Munawara).

Mumtaz Mahal died shortly after delivering her fourteenth child in 1631. The Mughal court was then residing in Burhanpur. Her remains were temporarily buried by the grief-stricken emperor in a spacious garden known as Zainabad on the bank of the river Tapti. Six months later her body was transported to Agra, where it was interred in land chosen for the mausoleum. This land, situated south of the Mughal city on the bank of the Jumna, had belonged to the Kachhwaha rajas since the time of Raja Man Singh and was purchased from

#### **2 1 0**

![](_page_42_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 131. Tomb of Mumtaz Mahal, known as the Taj Mahal, Agra

the then current raja, Jai Singh. Although contemporary chronicles indicate Jai Singh's willing cooperation in this exchange, extant farmans (imperial commands) indicate that the final price was not settled until almost two years after the mausoleum's commencement. Jai Singh's further cooperation was insured by imperial orders issued between 1632 and 1637 demanding that he provide stone masons and carts to transport marble from the mines at Makrana, within his ancestral domain, to Agra where both the Taj Mahal and Shah Jahan's additions to the Agra fort were constructed concurrently.

Work on the mausoleum was commenced early in 1632. Inscriptional evidence indicates much of the tomb was completed by 1636. By 1643, when Shah Jahan most lavishly celebrated the Urs ceremony for Mumtaz Mahal, the entire complex was virtually complete.

Some of the numerous artists who worked on the Tai Mahal are known from contemporary sources. Makramat Khan, later associated with the supervision of Shahjahanabad, and <sup>c</sup>Abd al-Karim, a master architect in Jahangir's reign and subsequently responsible for the Shah Burj in the Lahore fort completed in 1631-32, supervised the project. Amanat Khan was the chief calligrapher. No architect's name is recorded in the contemporary chronicles; however, a work by the poet Lutf Allah identifies the poet's father, Ustad Ahmad, later Shahjahanabad's architect, as the designer of Mumtaz Mahal's tomb.<sup>40</sup> Shah Jahan himself doubtless played a major role in the design and execution of this tomb, as he did in his other architectural enterprises. Possibly the emperor's active role in design explains why Ustad Ahmad's name is omitted in the official chronicle written by Lahauri.

The entire complex was proportionally designed according to a series of geometrically related grids, hence explaining not only the tomb's perfect balance but also that of the entire complex.<sup>41</sup> The initial part of the complex is a red sandstone forecourt (*chowk-i jilo khana*) south of the walled garden. This area, like its counterpart at Jahangir's tomb, was intended for the imperial retinue. A magnificent red sandstone gateway, about 30 meters high and leading into the walled garden, also serves as the northern wall of the forecourt. The entrance is within a deeply recessed central arch that is surmounted by small domed *chattris* recalling Akbar's ceremonial entrance, the Buland Darwaza, to his Jamic mosque at Fatehpur Sikri (Plate 23). The entire central *pishtaq* is framed by a rectangular panel composed of black Arabic lettering inlaid into a white marble ground and dated 1647. Four chapters from the Quran comprise this text, including the final verses from a chapter entitled Daybreak that invites the faithful to enter paradise  $(89: 28-30)$ . This message is

similar to that given not in Quranic verse but in a Persian poem on the gateway to Akbar's tomb in nearby Sikandra (Plate j8).<sup>42</sup> This parallel is not fortuitous, for the calligrapher responsible for both these gates was cAbd al-Haqq Shirazi, who had been awarded the title Amanat Khan early in Shah Jahan's reign. Although Amanat Khan died about two years before the calligraphy on the gate was completed, the close stylistic similarities and the programmatic unity of all the verses on the complex suggest that his design continued to be followed.

Beyond the forecourt is a four-part garden divided into quadrants by wide waterways that resemble the streams of paradise mentioned in the Quran more than the much narrower courses at earlier Mughal tombs. They meet at a large tank in the garden's center. The garden is clearly modeled on a wellestablished concept, the garden of paradise.

At the garden's northern end, not in its center, is the splendid tomb. It is flanked on the west by a red sandstone mosque surmounted by white marble domes and on the east by a nearly identical structure called in contemporary texts a guest house or *mehman khana.* The mosque's facade is delicately inlaid with white marble and in its spandrels are colored stones, while the interior is richly polychromed.

Mumtaz Mahal's superbly proportioned mausoleum is seated on the center of a high square marble plinth that elevates the tomb above the garden. The plinth is at the river's edge, and to compensate for the effects of flooding it rests on deeply sunk wells. At each corner of the plinth is a four-storied marble minaret recalling those used in earlier Timurid funereal architecture, for example the Gur-i Amir at Samarqand, as well as at Jahangir's tomb (Plate 103) whose construction was commenced by Shah Jahan only a few years before the Taj Mahal. Surmounted by a bulbous white dome, the tomb is essentially square in plan with corners chamfered to form a Baghdadi octagon. Each of the tomb's four faces is marked by a high central *pishtaq* flanked by deeply recessed arched apertures. The design is controlled and balanced, creating a unique architectural achievement that many consider one of the wonders of the world.

The Taj Mahal has often been likened to Humayun's tomb (Plates 18 and 19), a building essentially Timurid in character and designed by an architect trained in the Timurid homeland. This form, quite different from more nearly contemporary multi-tiered Mughal tombs, was probably adopted because Shah Jahan was immensely proud of his Timurid ancestry (upon his accession, remember, he adopted the very titles used by Timur).

2 I 3

<sup>42</sup> A discussion of all the calligraphy on the Taj is in W. E. Begley, "Amanat Khan and the Calligraphy of the Taj Mahal," *Kunst des Orients,* xn, 1978-79, 5-39.

The exterior of the mausoleum is primarily white marble. Inlaid colored stones are more sparsely used here than on his palace architecture constructed at the same time. As on the gate facade, rectangular panels with black calligraphy rendering verses from the Quran are inlaid into the tomb's white surface. The play of light, reflected and absorbed by the marble surface, is a dominant decorative device. Light continues to have a metaphoric role, associated with God's presence, as it did in Jahangir's monuments. While Islam teaches that God is everywhere, nowhere would God's presence be more appropriate than in the gardens of paradise, that is, the ultimate abode of the true believer. A series of panels carved with sprays of floral motifs form dadoes along the tomb's base. Although the matching of flowers with the leaves on a single spray defies botanical identification, the flowers depicted - roses, narcissus and tulips among others - came in Persianate culture to be associated with the flowers of paradise; moreover, they are the flowers used to describe the features of the beloved in Persian mystic poetry. The beloved on the most profound level is a metaphor for God and also might refer to the beloved of the emperor, his deceased wife here entombed.

The layout of the tomb's ground floor is similar to that at Humayun's tomb, although here the surrounding chambers are linked in a more fluid fashion. As at Humayun's tomb, they are intended to represent the eight levels of paradise in Islamic cosmology. The central chamber is octagonal. In its center is a magnificent inlaid marble cenotaph marking the placement of Mumtaz Mahal's interred body in the crypt below. Shah Jahan's cenotaph, similarly embellished, is to the west of the deceased queen's. The off-center position of Shah Jahan's cenotaph in no way indicates that it was added as an afterthought. In the tomb of I<sup>c</sup> timad al-Daula, built in *162.6—zj,* his wife's cenotaph, not his, occupies the more prominent central position. Surrounding the cenotaphs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal is a carved latticed marble screen that Shah Jahan ordered to replace the gold one designed by Bebadal Khan, his master goldsmith. Shah Jahan became worried that the gold one would be looted.

The interior, like the exterior, bears rectangular bands of Quranic verses, more than on any earlier Mughal building. Quranic passages, many of them entire chapters, are inscribed on the tomb complex. All those chosen for inclusion here have a common theme, the reward promised to believers and the fate of eternal doom that awaits non-believers on the Day of Judgment.<sup>43</sup> This theme is appropriate for funereal architecture. The number of Quranic verses and their emphasis on the Day of Judgment is reinforced by the location of the mausoleum, not only at the end of the paradisical gardens but also on the platform above them. That position matches the very location of God's throne,

<sup>43</sup> For this and material presented below, see Begley, "Amanat Khan," and his "The Myth of the Taj Mahal and a New Theory of its Symbolic Meaning," *Art Bulletin,* LVI, i, 1979.

which, according to Islamic tradition, will be above the gardens of paradise. This is illustrated in a diagrammatic drawing that Shah Jahan owned depicting the assembled on the Day of Judgment. This drawing possibly served as a model for the design of the Taj Mahal, intended not only as a tomb for his beloved wife and himself, but also as a visual replica of the throne of God on that momentous day. Although such an interpretation may seem radical, in fact, evoking God's throne was not an innovation here. Earlier it was a common poetic conceit and continued in contemporary writing to be used as an image for tombs, gardens, palaces and mosques.

All the designers of this unique tomb were highly educated not only in mathematics, engineering and astrology, but also in literature and, of course, theology. They were thus well prepared to formulate the tomb's symbolic program as the ultimate vision of paradise on earth. That such a program would appeal to Shah Jahan is not difficult to accept, for paradisical imagery is found in nearly every work he commissioned.

### BUILDINGS OF THE CHIEF IMPERIAL PRINCESS AND THE HEIR APPARENT

Nur Jahan's impressive architectural output in Jahangir's reign may have motivated the leading ladies of Shah Jahan's court to endow many of the major buildings within cities. The foremost leading lady was Jahan Ara, entitled Begum Sahib. Although not an architectural patron of Nur Jahan's innovative stature, Jahan Ara, Shah Jahan's oldest surviving daughter and his constant companion after Mumtaz Mahal's death, provided many notable buildings. Among these, the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque in Agra (Plate 116) and her serai and garden known as Sahibabad, were discussed earlier in their urban context. These, however, were not the only buildings she constructed.

Deeply religious, Jahan Ara wrote a biography of the Chishti saint Muc in al-Din and reputedly gave large sums to his *dargah* in Ajmer. She also added the white marble pillared porch before the entrance of Muc in al-Din's tomb in Ajmer. Today it is known as the Begumi Dalan, derived from her title, Begum Sahib. Jahan Ara's devotion to saints of the Chishti order is well known and even recorded on her simple white marble tombstone (Plate 167), situated in close proximity to Nizam al-Din's own tomb in Delhi. Less well known is her admiration for Mulla Shah Badakhshi of the Qadiri order and her subsequent initiation into the order. The princess built a mosque for the mulla (Plate 132) and spacious dwellings for the poor beneath Akbar's Srinagar fort on Hari Parbat hill.

Both Shah Jahan, visiting the recently constructed mosque in 1651, and the French traveler Bernier had only praise for this single-aisled three-bayed structure surrounded by high enclosure walls. While the grey stone used in

![](_page_47_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 132. Mosque of Mulla Shah Badakhshi, Srinagar

construction was local, the delicately carved and cusped entrance arches recall those on Shah Jahan's contemporary palace architecture. These apertures are actually extended brackets within a trabeated door frame, another feature typical of Shah Jahan's architecture.

Jahan Ara was not the only member of the royal family to build for Mulla Shah. The heir apparent, Dara Shukoh, a mystic who drew from both Hindu and Muslim traditions in his quest for spiritual fulfillment, also provided buildings for his spiritual guide, Mulla Shah. On a hillside overlooking Dal lake and set against the lofty mountains, he built a school, known as Pari Mahal. Like the nearby Mughal gardens, the now ruined school is constructed on a series of terraces. It has an austere stone-faced quadrangle enclosing spacious vaulted chambers.

Religious architecture was not Jahan Ara's only concern in Kashmir. The garden and spring at Achibal were also a focus of her attention. Among the works she ordered there in 1640 were a public viewing balcony *(jharoka),* a bath, and living quarters.<sup>44</sup> Her patronage made such an impact on the site that it came to be known as Sahibabad after Jahan Ara, who was known as the Begum Sahib. Bernier described the rushing spring, its ancillary canals, the fruit

trees and the garden's buildings as exceptionally handsome. Achibal remains one of the most impressive of all Mughal sites (Plate *66),* even though Jahan Ara's structures no longer survive in their original condition.

A contemporary writer listing the garden and estates of Lahore includes one built by Jahan Ara, probably the garden whose gate is known as Chauburji (Plate 133). The enormous gateway, marked by towering minarets at each corner, is brick constructed with elaborate tile facing, a material common in Lahore. This gate bears an inscription dated 1646, stating that Jahan Ara first built the garden's entrance gate, but then bestowed it upon Miyan Bai, probably a high-ranking attendant. Although Miyan Bai's identity is obscure, she possessed adequate wealth to construct a mosque in Ajmer (Plate 137), built only a few years earlier, and to complete the garden herself.

### SUB-IMPERIAL PATRONAGE

On the whole we have less insight into Shah Jahan's attitude toward the structures built by others than we do into Jahangir's. This is because Shah Jahan viewed the design and construction of architecture as his own special domain. Even so, Bernier observed that nobles hoping to gain Shah Jahan's favor embellished Shahjahanabad at their own expense. At least they gained the

2 I7

emperor's attention, for he rewarded his nobles for their architectural patronage. For example, Zafar Khan's rank was increased for the construction of a fine garden in Kashmir as well as for his diplomatic dealings with the unruly population.<sup>45</sup>

### *Western India*

#### *Thatta*

Nowhere in western India is the debt to Timurid-inspired brick construction and tile-covered surfaces more apparent than in the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque in Thatta. This is not surprising since the rulers of Sind whom the Mughals defeated had come from Afghanistan. Persian inscriptions rendered in tile indicate that the mosque was constructed between 1644 and 1647 at Shah Jahan's order. However, since Shah Jahan was nowhere near Thatta at that time, there is little reason to believe he was personally involved in the project. Nevertheless, the unusually careful crafting of this brick structure and its magnificent profuse tilework suggest that the mosque was subsidized by the imperial coffers. The mosque may have been constructed in part to reverse the effects of a devastating storm that had swept through the city in 1637.46

The mosque's prayer chamber's plan and even elevation derive from older conservative Timurid-influenced structures such as the Kachpura mosque in Agra or the Akbari one in Ajmer (Plates 12 and 40). The surface and its decor, however, are modeled on local brick buildings that in turn were based on Iranian prototypes, for example, the nearby tomb built in 1601 for Mirza Jani Beg, an earlier ruler of Thatta. There are no projecting eaves or other members that articulate the building's surface as characteristic of much Indo-Islamic architecture. Rather, deeply recessed arches pierce the brick-and-tile covered facade, producing a structure that appears to be composed of two contrasting planes. The placement and color of the inlaid tiles on the facade recall this monument's Iranian ancestry. For example, unlike tiles in contemporary Lahore, where only a single color was glazed on a tile, here multiple colors and patterns appear on a single tile.

The interior is a showpiece of glazed tilework (Plate 134). The central dome is embellished with tiles arranged in a stellate pattern designed to symbolize the heavens, while the walls are covered with floral, geometric and calligraphic patterns. The three mihrabs, also unusually designed, are composed of pierced stone screens that allow the entry of light. Thus in an area where often a lamp is carved referring to the Quranic verse that likens God's presence to a lamp within a niche, here actual light enters. The use of pierced screens allowing for the entrance of light was common on Mughal funereal architecture, but unique

here to a Mughal mosque. While this mosque reveals a close adherence to forms and techniques used earlier in this region, its plan and design suggest an awareness of architectural traditions beyond these local roots.

### *Gujarat*

Under Shah Jahan, Ahmadabad continued to be the major city of Gujarat. The new buildings, both religious and secular, generally were designed in the current Mughal style, not a local idiom, as we see in monuments provided by Ac zam Khan. Among his many works is the serai built in 1637-38. A<sup>c</sup> zam Khan had been appointed governor of Gujarat in 1636, a position he held for six years. The serai was located conveniently adjacent to the main entrance of the city's citadel. It has undergone alterations, although enough of the seventeenthcentury structure remains to determine its original appearance. This quadrangular building, measuring about 64 by 73 meters, is entered through a high two-storied central portal (Plate 135). The stellate and net vaulting of the interior chambers is typically Mughal. Neither this serai nor the similar nearby

![](_page_51_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 135. Entrance, Ac zam Khan's serai, Ahmadabad

Shahi Bagh palace (Plate 75) belongs to local building traditions, but rather to the Timurid-inspired Mughal tradition. The choice of such a style is hardly surprising since A<sup>c</sup> zam Khan was not only a high-ranking Mughal amir but also was extremely proud of his Iranian heritage, maintaining the customs of his homeland throughout his life.

Ac zam Khan was an enthusiastic builder. His structures are noted in Mathura and Jaunpur, among other places, but the greatest number is in Gujarat. These include three forts, one of which, Shahpur fort in Ranpur, still survives, but his mosques, a well and baths are known only from written references.

### Rajasthan

At Ajmer during earlier Mughal reigns, building activity was largely concentrated within the *dargah* of Muc in al-Din Chishti or in its vicinity (Plates 40 and 41). During Shah Jahan's reign, only the emperor and his family provided buildings within the shrine, while structures erected in close proximity, provided by the religious or courtly elite, emulate the imperially sponsored buildings.

For example, close to the esteemed shrine is the tomb of Khwaja Husain, the

### SUB-IMPERIAL PATRONAGE

![](_page_52_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 136. Tomb of Khwaja Husain, Ajmer

*dargah's* attendant early in Akbar's reign (Plate 136). The tomb, dated 1637-38, is located west of Shah Jahan's recently completed Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque, just outside the *dargah's* compound. Provided by Khwaja Dilawar, this tomb is constructed of a cream-colored stone. It is a less refined version of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din's nearby tomb, perhaps intentional since Khwaja Husain had restored the shrine's dome. In any event, Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din's tomb was *the* monument to emulate, as if to imply a link with the saint. Despite Khwaja Husain's fall from favor in Akbar's reign, it is notable that he - not the many other attendants of the shrine - was honored with a monumental tomb, as if to restore him to favor.

Two mosques were built during Shah Jahan's reign on the main street leading to the *dargah's* entrance. Each was built by a woman, one the daughter of a renowned musician and the other by Miyan Bai, to whom Jahan Ara had given a garden in Lahore. The more impressive is Miyan Bai's mosque, constructed in 1643-44 an d closely modeled on Shah Jahan's mosque completed some four years earlier within the nearby shrine. Five entrance arches supported on slender piers, almost identical in appearance to those on the nearby imperial mosque, form the east facade of Miyan Bai's mosque; the central mihrab (Plate 137) closely relates to those on Shah Jahan's larger mosque (Plate 106).

![](_page_53_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 137. Mihrab, Miyan Bai's mosque, Ajmer

Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din's house of meditation *{chilla khana),* where the saint resided until his death, was also a site of veneration. Located on a hill overlooking the Ana Sagar tank, this small dwelling was restored in 1628 by Daulat Khan, the revenue collector under Mahabat Khan, one of Shah Jahan's very highestranking nobles. The *chilla khana's* inscription suggests that Daulat Khan rebuilt it as a thanksgiving for the advancement he received when Mahabat Khan was appointed governor of Ajmer and given the new title Khan-i Khanan. It has been restored so frequently that its seventeenth-century appearance cannot be determined.

This was a period when the relationship between Rajput princes and the Mughal court was generally harmonious. For example, the patrons of an cIdgah (Plate 138) built between December 1655 and January 1656 in Merta (Nagaur District) state that they benefited from the kindness of the Marwar maharaja, Jaswant Singh. These patrons, Farahat Khan and Misri, son of Bahadur Khan, were probably Mughal agents. Their cIdgah reflects an interaction of Mughal and Rajput forms.

Mughal architectural forms are apparent in the similarity of this cIdgah to

Plate 138. cIdgah, Merta

one constructed in 1628 in Patna by Saif Khan, a pre-eminent grandee of Shah Jahan's court. The Merta cIdgah simply consists of a west wall as do most mosques of this type, allowing the entire Muslim community to gather in the open area to its east. Like the Patna cIdgah, this one is marked by shallow arched mihrabs in the west wall, each surmounted by an embattlement with cusped *kungura.* Reflecting Rajput prototypes, however, are the proportionately large *chattris* that mark the north and south ends of the structure. They resemble local forms, especially *chattris* used in this part of India as Hindu memorials for the deceased.

Interaction between Mughals and Rajput princes, however, was not always mutually beneficial. Imperial orders *(farmans)* indicate that Raja Jai Singh of Amber was prohibited from using the Makrana marble quarries in his own *watan jagir.* They were utilized almost exclusively during the 1630s for imperial buildings. With the commencement of Shahjahanabad in 1639, the imperial monopoly over the stone quarried here probably continued until the city's inauguration in 1648. While restricting the raja's own building activities, considerable income was generated at the quarries. For example, Pahar Khan was able to found a village, well and marble mosque, now totally ruined, in conjunction with two of the quarries between i65oand 1654. He was probably a Silawat Muslim, the community traditionally associated with the lucrative Makrana marble industry.

Plate 139. Muhammad Sharif Quraishi's mosque, known today as the Kachehri mosque, Didwana

Not everything built in Mughal times, even some works constructed in response to imperial order, reflects recent building trends. For example, the Kachehri mosque in Didwana (Nagaur District), built in 1638 by Muhammad Sharif Quraishi following royal command, reveals no awareness of contemporary trends elsewhere (Plate 139). In plan, this structure consists of three aisles of seven bays each. Slender faceted but wholly unembellished pillars, similar to those on Jahangir-period structures, support a flat roof. Generally the mosque's plan and overall appearance adhere to earlier regional types such as Nagaur's Sur-period Chowk-ki Masjid dated 1553.

#### *North India*

#### *Lahore to Delhi*

Lahore was situated strategically on the way to Kabul, Multan and Kashmir. Thus a strong imperial presence there was vital to holding important territories to the north and west. The city, according to Manrique who visited Lahore in 1641, was embellished with magnificent buildings and gardens. Imperial work at the Lahore fort as well as on the city's outskirts continued into the 1640s and, as at other major cities, stimulated similar activity by the nobility.

Plate 140. Wazir Khan's mosque, Lahore

Wazir Khan, governor of Punjab and a distinguished physician of the Mughal court, was among the active builders in Lahore. He embellished the city with many buildings, among them a residence known as *baradari,* probably originally within a larger garden complex. This is a two-storied flat-roofed structure surmounted by *chattris.* Its interior arrangement, typical since Akbar's time, consists of a central chamber surrounded by smaller ones. The *baradari* was built outside the city walls, in the suburbs of Lahore, though the majority of Wazir Khan's buildings were inside its walls.

Wazir Khan held a great deal of land in the city near the Delhi gate. There he provided a magnificent Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque (Plate 140) as well as shops, a serai, houses and a large *hammam* whose income supported the mosque. The singleaisled five-bayed mosque was constructed in 1634-35 at the grave-site of an esteemed saint, Miran Badshah, whose tomb is located in the mosque's open courtyard. It is elevated on a plinth and entered through a high portal on the east whose interior chamber is a Baghdadi octagon. The spectacular painted prayer chamber of this mosque is modeled on that of the mosque of Maryam al-Zamani dated 1613, also in Lahore. Other features, however - for example, the high arched galleries surrounding the mosque's deep central courtyard recall features of Iranian *(our-aiwan* mosques. Four towering minarets, one in each corner of the interior courtyard, dominate the building, an innovation at this time.

Following regional building techniques, the mosque is brick constructed and faced with tiles depicting floral sprays, arabesques and calligraphic panels, all executed in glazed, cut and inlaid tile. The tiles' colors are distinctive, different for example from the predominant blues and whites used in Multan, another tile-glazing center in the Punjab. The prayer chamber's interior as well as the central *pishtaq's* recessed arch bear stellate vaulting and are richly polychromed using a technique similar to that on Maryam al-Zamani's mosque (Plate 62).

Tile-covered brick structures were the hallmark of sub-imperial Mughal architecture in Lahore during Shah Jahan's period and later, generally distinguishing non-imperial works from most imperial ones. For example, garden entrances were often tile-covered, including the Gulabi Bagh gate built in 1655-56 by Mirza Sultan Beg, commander of the imperial fleet. Also beautifully tile-faced is a single-aisled three-bayed mosque provided in 1650. Commonly called the mosque of Dai Anga (a wet-nurse), inscriptions on its facade indicate it was built under the supervision of Maqbul, whom some have associated with Khwaja Maqbul, a trusted servant of Dara Shukoh.

The mosque of Maqbul, or Dai Anga as this building is still called, is irregular in plan so that it could be aligned with the pre-existing road and still face Mecca. The facade, adhering to a well-established type, is pierced by three cusped entrance arches, a feature not seen on the earlier tile-covered mosques of Lahore. The central *pishtaq* (Plate 141), higher than either flanking bay, is covered with calligraphic panels and bands, floral sprays and arabesques all executed in fine tilework inlaid in mosaic-like fashion.

The area between Lahore and Delhi came to be heavily traveled, necessitating the construction at this time of additional serais. Serai Dakhni and Serai Amanat Khan are the two most notable ones provided here by nobles during this period. Although uninscribed, Serai Dakhni (Mahlian Kalan, Jalandhar District) was probably constructed by a noble of considerable status. The tile ornamentation on its monumental entrance arches and the polygonal corner towers is remarkably similar to those features on Wazir Khan's Lahore mosque of 1634 (Plate 140). It suggests that either Wazir Khan, Shah Jahan's governor of the Punjab for seven years beginning in 1632, was the patron, or that the artists responsible for his mosque also designed this serai.47

Serai Amanat Khan, completed in 1640—41, was built by the calligrapher of the Taj Mahal. Its tile-covered gateways are more highly refined versions of those on Serai Dakhni. Bold calligraphic bands, rendered in blue and yellow tiles, frame the facade of the serai's main structure, that is, its gates and mosque. According to the dedicatory inscription on the west gate, Amanat Khan founded the serai, designing and writing this epigraph himself. Amanat Khan retired to the serai in 1639 after the death of his brother, Afzal Khan, to whom

he was deeply attached. The tomb of the famed calligrapher, who died in 1644 or 1645, is just outside the serai compound.

The prime location of buildings on the Lahore-Delhi road probably explains, in part, their reflection of current taste. That is the case even with some buildings whose patrons are unknown, for example, the tomb of Hajji Jamal, known locally as the tomb of the Shagird (student) in Nakodar (Jalandhar District). This brick tomb, dated 1657, is a large square structure with engaged octagonal corner minarets, recalling the general plan of Khusrau's tomb in Allahabad. This type had been well-established earlier in Mughal architecture, but the ornamentation of this brick tomb reveals a close awareness of contemporary buildings in Lahore. For example, the colored tile mosaic *(kashi kari),* inlaid into patterns representing floral sprays in vases and fruit in bowls, recalls ornament on the mosque of Wazir Khan and Jahan Ara's Chauburji.

More than almost any monument of the Delhi-Lahore road, Shaikh Chilli's madrasa and tomb in Thanesar (Kurukshetra District) reveal an awareness of contemporary Mughal taste. They do not, however, simply imitate earlier buildings or ornamentation, and their refinement suggests a patron of considerable wealth and taste. The madrasa is a quadrangle constructed around an open courtyard. Each interior side of the quadrangle has nine chambers, each entered through a high arch. These deeply recessed entrances emphasize the flatness of the surface, recalling Iranian prototypes.

The quadrangular school is brick-constructed, while the tomb (Plate 142) and mosque, situated in an elevated walled compound to the south, are built of buff stone. In plan and even to some extent in elevation, the octagonal tomb continues a type seen as early as Akbar's period, for example, the tomb of Shah Quli Khan at Narnaul (Plate 43). The differences in detail, however, are considerable. While the earlier Narnaul tomb has an elaborate facade whose surface is articulated by both contrasting colors and a variety of architectural shapes, the Thanesar tomb emphasizes the uniformity of its stone and highly burnished plaster surface. The tomb's style as well as its white bulbous dome resting on an elongated drum are characteristic of Shah Jahan's time.

Muqarrab Khan's renovation at Bu cAli Qalandar's shrine in Panipat was considered sufficiently important that it was mentioned in Mughal texts. The style chosen, however, is decidedly conservative. Muqarrab Khan, a highranking officer under Jahangir, retired to serve in Shah Jahan's reign as the shrine's hereditary custodian and probably had little contact with current architectural trends. Within the shrine Muqarrab Khan built a walled enclosure around the tomb of this fourteenth-century saint. There he also built his own tomb (dated 1643-44) and a mosque. The central chamber of his tomb is surrounded by a screened veranda (Plate 143). These stone-carved screens

## SUB-IMPERIAL PATRONAGE

Plate 142. Shaikh Chilli's tomb, Thanesar

recall those at the late Jahangir-period tomb of Mirza cAziz Koka in the *dargah* of Nizam al-Din in Delhi (Plate 79), reflecting a screening type popular before Muqarrab Khan's retirement. Also conservative in form is his single-aisled mosque built into the massive enclosure walls of the complex. Muqarrab Khan amassed great wealth and is noted for building several other structures in his native town of Kairana (Muzaffarnagar District).

## *Delhi and the central plains*

Despite the extensive building campaign that created Shahjahanabad, Delhi retains very few structures resulting from sub-imperial patronage in Shah Jahan's time. Those that do survive were built after Shahjahanabad was founded. Only two merit discussion, one in characteristic Mughal style, the other rather different. The Daiwali mosque, built in 1653-54, although heavily rebuilt, retains many features typical of Shah Jahan-period structures, for example, its single-aisled three-bayed plan and the entranceway crowned by cusped arches. By contrast a mosque provided by Khwaja Turab in 1652—53 was built not in a style currently in favor but in an older mode, surprising in the

Plate 143. Muqarrab Khan's tomb, Panipat

capital. This red sandstone mosque, no longer standing but known from old descriptions, was situated close to the Ajmer gate.

According to one European traveler, the area around Nizam al-Din's *dargab* infrequently was visited by members of the Mughal court during Shah Jahan's reign. Nevertheless travel near the shrine was sufficient to support the construction there of a new serai, built in 1642-43 by a daughter of Zain Khan, a high-ranking noble.<sup>48</sup> The *dargah* figures little in contemporary writing, but Shah Jahan did visit the shrine occasionally. When there in 1634 and again in 1638 he gave large sums to the tomb and shrine.<sup>49</sup> The shrine was enhanced in 1652-53 by the emperor's governor of Shahjahanabad, Khalil Allah Khan, who constructed a new veranda of red sandstone pillars around Nizam al-Din's Akbar-period tomb. These red pillars were replaced in the nineteenth century by the marble baluster-type columns that are still present.

European travelers make clear that even after Shah Jahan shifted his capital to Delhi, Agra still remained the largest city in all Hindustan. They comment on the numerous serais and road markers *(kos minar)* seen on the journey between Delhi and Agra, but according to these travelers the road provided little else of interest. Agra, by contrast, was a splendid city, although many of

Plate 144. Tomb of Firuz Khan, Agra

the roads were too narrow and irregular. Every European comments on the magnificent mausolea of Agra, most notably the tombs of Mumtaz Mahal and Akbar (Plates 131 and 56). The Frenchman Tavernier observed that the court eunuchs *(khwajasera)* in particular wanted similar tombs for themselves. He noted that these wealthy eunuchs had been denied permission to go on the Hajj, so that funds could be maintained within the confines of the Mughal empire.<sup>50</sup> They thus lavished expenses on themselves, among other things constructing their own fine tombs. They did this since all unexpended monies reverted to the state, thus ultimately encouraging a constant cash flow.

The mausoleum of the eunuch Firuz Khan (Plate 144), located just south of Agra on the Dholpur road, is a splendid example. Firuz Khan first served under Jahangir, and under Shah Jahan was responsible for the imperial harem until his death in 1647 or 1648. While contemporary texts praise a garden he constructed on the banks of the Jhelum, today he is remembered for his red sandstone tomb situated in a walled enclosure west of a large tank. A double-storied gate leads to the domed octagonal tomb, whose shape is similar to the contemporary

50 Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, *Travels in India,* 2 vols., tr. V. Ball (2nd ed., London, 1925), 1: 89.

tomb of Shaikh Chilli in Thanesar (Plate 142). However, in contrast to the uniform, largely unembellished surface on the Thanesar tomb, the surface of Firuz Khan's tomb is covered with exquisitely carved panels of contrasting colored stones. The entrance gate also is composed of red sandstone whose surface is carved prolifically (Plate 145).

Possibly Firuz Khan's tomb was built in the 1640s, when he was at the height of his career and had amassed great wealth. But the gate's profuse ornamentation is reminiscent of that on the Kanch Mahal or the mosque of Mu<sup>c</sup> tamad Khan, both structures of Jahangir's reign (Plates 81-83). 1° Shah Jahan's time, there is an increasing tendency toward sleek uncluttered lines. However, as head of the harem, Firuz Khan would have had access to Shah Jahan's private quarters. There he might have seen buildings such as the Agra fort's Shah Burj, whose interiors were more profusely ornamented, though by inlaid stones, not carving. Possibly then he was inspired by the private imperial quarters familiar to him rather than by any older aesthetic.

Not only eunuchs but other courtiers, too, built tombs in Agra. One tomb, known as the Chini-ka Rauza or the Tomb of China, after the profusion of tilework on its exterior, is believed to be the grave of Afzal Khan, Shah Jahan's finance minister *(diwan-i kull).* He died at the end of 1638. Contemporary texts note that his tomb was across the Jumna from the city of Agra. This corresponds with the location of the Chini-ka Rauza, on the banks of the Jumna between Nur Jahan's Nur Afshan garden and I<sup>c</sup> timad al-Daula's tomb. The tomb was originally within a garden. The exterior tilework of this squareplan tomb is badly damaged, but enough remains to indicate its original character. Covering the facade are panels of floral patterns within niches that recall the color, technique and patterns of designs on the near-contemporary mosque of Wazir Khan in Lahore dated 1634. No other contemporary structure in the Agra region is embellished with tile, suggesting a link between the tomb's designer and Lahore.

Inside the tomb is a central octagonal chamber with interlinking ancillary chambers at each of the corners. The interior is magnificently painted, although it has been severely damaged (Plate 146). Quranic verses are carved in stucco along the top of the tomb's central chamber. Although no calligrapher's name is recorded, these verses were clearly executed by a master artist, probably Amanat Khan, the calligrapher of the Taj Mahal, for the interred is Amanat Khan's brother, to whom he was devoted.<sup>51</sup>

Amanat Khan's name is inscribed on Agra's Shahi Madrasa mosque (Plate 147), built in 1636. He designed and signed the Quranic inscriptions on the three interior white marble mihrabs. The small single-aisled three-bayed mosque is strikingly simple in appearance. A panel of cartouche and lozenge

Plate 145. Detail of carving on entrance, Firuz Khan's tomb, Agra

medallions rendered in stucco frame the arched entrances in a manner similar to Humayun's Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque at Kachpura constructed over a century earlier (Plate 12). The very high and wide entrance arches open directly to the austere interior, allowing for excellent illumination. The only ornamentation is the three marble mihrabs. The attention given to these mihrabs suggests that perhaps Amanat Khan not only designed its calligraphy but also constructed the mosque. The content of the inscriptions here, like those Amanat Khan designed for the Taj Mahal and Akbar's tomb, are cogently ordered. That is, the outer band of verses on the central mihrab are ones that invite the faithful to pray and to avoid outside temptations. The inner verses proclaim the victory of Islam against unbelievers.52

Despite the common belief that Shah Jahan built the enormous red sandstone c Idgah in Agra (Plate 148), it is more likely a sub-imperial product and possibly not even of Shah Jahan's time. Little wonder that it is commonly attributed to Shah Jahan, for several features of this cIdgah are characteristic of

Plate 147. Shahi Madrasa mosque, Agra

his architecture. For example, it does not consist simply of the qibla or west wall, but has an interior chamber resembling the cIdgah that Shah Jahan erected outside the walled city of Shahjahanabad in 165 5. The cusped entrance, beneath a high cusped arch, stands within a tall central *pishtaq.* In the apex of the central mihrab is a radiating sun whose rays lead to delicate scrolled intersecting tracery. This recalls similar patterns found on the vault of the Macchi Bhavan's baldachin in the nearby Agra fort and in the mihrabs of Shah Jahan's Jami<sup>c</sup> mosques in Shahjahanabad and the Agra fort. Despite these features unique in Shah Jahan's period to imperial patronage - this building is mentioned in no text; moreover, the structure lacks epigraphs found on all of Shah Jahan's large mosques. In fact, it is possible that this cIdgah was built later, in Aurangzeb's reign, when motifs formerly used exclusively by imperial patrons became common. That possibility is further suggested by the overall sense of height, often associated with Aurangzeb's period.

About 1632, the noble Rustam Khan was awarded Sambhal, the site of the earliest Mughal mosque, as his landholding. Although he served in many regions, he continued to hold land in that vicinity for a considerable period. Most landholdings were changed about every two years. But just as earlier Raja Man Singh had held Rohtas for an extended time due to construction there, Rustam Khan's tenure of Sambhal may have been a reward for founding a new city and fort known as Moradabad, about 25 km from Sambhal. He named this new city Rustamabad, after himself, a name Shah Jahan did not sanction. He

![](_page_67_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 148. cIdgah, Agra

then changed the name to Moradabad, after Prince Murad Bakhsh, one of Shah Jahan's sons. This recalls Raja Man Singh's unsuccessful attempt to name his new city in Bengal after himself. More significantly, it suggests that the founding of cities by the nobility still was subject to imperial scrutiny.

The inscription on the Moradabad Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque indicates that a noble entitled Rustam Khan built it in 1636-37 on orders from Shah Jahan. The mosque overlooks the Ganges river. It is a very large structure on a high mound where, as the inscription notes, only infidels had resided. The Moradabad Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque has undergone considerable renovation. Only by examining the original east facade beneath the extensive modern veranda are its seventeenthcentury features recognizable. The central bay appears to have been higher than the flanking side wings, typical of mosques at this time. In its original condition, the mosque was double aisled.

Moradabad soon replaced nearby Sambhal as the area's primary city. However, Sambhal remained adequately important for Rustam Khan that in 1655 he provided an ^Idgah there. The following year he repaired the Baburperiod Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque at Sambhal. Only twenty-five years earlier the mosque had been repaired, suggesting the continued importance of this earliest Mughal mosque.

### *Eastern India*

### *Bihar*

When the prince Shah Jahan rebelled against Jahangir in 1623, he eventually took Burdwan in Bengal and then established a counter-court in Rajmahal. Subsequently he spent time at Rohtas, where his son Murad Bakhsh was born. After his accession in 1628, however, he never returned to the eastern hinterlands. Instead, powerful and effective agents such as his son Prince Shah Shujac , Shaista Khan and Saif Khan were entrusted with their administration.

During Shah Jahan's reign, Patna remained the primary city in Bihar Province. Saif Khan, governor there from 1628 until 1632, did much to enhance the city, paralleling his earlier largess when he was Jahangir's governor of Gujarat. He built grand mansions, though they no longer survive, and at least two religious structures. One is an cIdgah that he provided in 1628, his first year as governor of Bihar. The central bay of its qibla wall, the only wall of this c Idgah, is higher than the successively lower flanking ones. It contains a deeply recessed tri-partite mihrab (Plate 149) whose demi-dome is marked by net vaulting. Each side of the wall has an engaged octagonal turret. This feature, seen earlier in Mughal architecture of Bihar and Bengal, such as Farid Bukhari's

![](_page_69_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 150. Central entrance, mosque of Hajji Tatar, Patna

Bihar Sharif mosque (Plate 94) and the Hajipur Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque, is derived from the region's pre-Mughal Islamic buildings.

Saif Khan also provided a theological school (madrasa) on the banks of the Ganges. Peter Mundy when visiting the school considered it a magnificent structure, apparently recognizing it as a product of the pan-Indian Mughal aesthetic. Since Saif Khan was related to the queen, Mumtaz Mahal, this building's imperial appearance is not surprising. Today, however, the complex is sadly ruined. The large five-bayed mosque mentioned by Mundy is now faced with a newer veranda, concealing its seventeenth-century character. Originally built to house over a hundred students, the madrasa complex was lined with large vaulted buildings, including a *hammam.* On the north side, overlooking the river, are *chattris* to provide shade. Next to the mosque on the west was a large double-storied entrance portal that Mundy describes as stately. Despite its date of 1629, it was still not completed in 1632, Mundy observed, although he indicates it was nevertheless in use. Foreign traders, for a fee, used the school for lodging.

Several mosques were constructed at this time along Patna's main city street

### SUB-IMPERIAL PATRONAGE

Plate 151. Mosque of Habib Khan Sur, Bihar Sharif

paralleling the Ganges, though only a few still remain. The best preserved is the mosque of Hajji Tatar. Exquisitely carved black stone frames the three arched entrances on the east facade (Plate 150). Such black stone is used at times on Mughal structures in Bihar and Bengal, but was commonly found on the mosques of Bengal before Mughal times. It is never used on structures outside of eastern India. The arched niches flanking the entrances and the facade's ribbed engaged columns are typical of mid-seventeenth-century buildings in eastern India, for example on Habib Khan Sur's mosque built in 1638 at nearby Bihar Sharif. The mosque's ties with local buildings are thus evident, despite its overall conformity with the prevailing Mughal aesthetic.

Habib Khan Sur held a position of great responsibility in Bihar, especially during the frequent absences of the governor. He provided several works in Bihar Sharif, all in proximity to the *dargah* of Sharaf al-Din Maneri (d. 1381), one of the subcontinent's most esteemed sufi saints. Among these is a refined mosque dated 1638 (Plate 151). This single-aisled three-domed mosque is modeled closely on Shaikh Farid Bukhari's nearby Jahangir-period mosque (Plate 94). It was thus almost certainly the product of a local but skilled architect. Several years later, in 1646, Habib Khan Sur constructed a tank and c Idgah near the shrine of the saint. The cIdgah is crudely constructed, revealing

![](_page_71_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 152. Raja Bahroz's mosque, Kharagpur

none of the refinements of the patron's earlier mosque, suggesting he had little role in its design.

Yet another structure influenced by those in Bihar Sharif is the mosque Raja Bahroz built in Kharagpur in 1656-57. Kharagpur, today in Munger District, long had been the seat of a prominent Hindu family in Bihar. Although initially allied with the Mughals, the Kharagpur rajas were defeated by them in the late sixteenth century. One member of the family acknowledged Mughal authority and converted to Islam. He was then reinstated on the Kharagpur throne. There his successors built several mosques and many more tombs, suggesting that the newly converted Kharagpur rajas consciously attempted to create a seat that proclaimed their new religious affiliation.

The most magnificent of these is Raja Bahroz's single-aisled three-domed mosque (Plate 152). Situated just north of the raja's palace on the bank of the river Man, the mosque is elevated on a high plinth, an increasingly common feature of later Mughal mosques. Visible from a great distance, this imposing mosque is the largest one built in eastern India since Raja Man Singh's Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque of c. 1600 in Rajmahal (Plate 37). The facade of Raja Bahroz's mosque, now obscured by a modern veranda, adhered closely to the form of contemporary mosques in Bihar Sharif. Because of the sanctity held by Bihar Sharif, those mosques doubtless were known to the converted family. Yet, as if to

### SUB-IMPERIAL PATRONAGE

![](_page_72_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 153. Tomb of Malik Wisal, Akbarpur

outshine the mosques of this esteemed city, Raja Bahroz's is even more elegantly ornamented than the ones that serve as its models. Its polychromed stucco relief is more profuse than the ornamentation of any other contemporary structure in eastern India. This is perhaps one way that these new converts manifest their enthusiasm for Islam.

While the Gangetic valley including Bihar Sharif and Patna was completely under Mughal control, the whole of south Bihar, especially the area around Rohtas, remained semi-independent until Aurangzeb's reign. Shortly after the rebel prince Shah Jahan stayed at Rohtas, this hill fort fell into the hands of an independent Hindu raja. In 1632 the Mughals regained the fort. Just four years later, in 1636, a Mughal official at the fort, Malik Wisal, indicated considerable confidence in long-term Mughal authority there by commencing his own tomb at the base of the hill, in Akbarpur (Plate 153). There he also provided a step well and garden. The tomb's inscriptions tell us that Malik Wisal undertook the construction at a time of deep sorrow in his life, although he found solace in his relationship with Ikhlas Khan, the fort's superintendent *{qalc adar),* which the inscription compares to the relationship between a son and his father. This probably reflects their difference in rank, not age. Ikhlas Khan, higher ranking, would have treated his subordinate as a son, reflecting the Mughal emperor's relation with his nobles. The tomb is a simple structure consisting of a walled

rectangular enclosure entered on the north. In the center of this open courtyard is a raised platform upon which are seven graves. A stone-faced wall mosque punctuated by three mihrabs is attached to its western end. Just outside the tomb is a massive step well, rare so far east in India. Since Mughal authorities commonly were transferred from one part of the realm to another, they served as vehicles for the movement not only of style, but also, as in this case, whole new forms.

#### *Bengal*

The lasting impact of Mughal architecture was felt late in Bengal. Little had been built here in Jahangir's reign. Even at the beginning of Shah Jahan's reign, the pan-Indian Mughal aesthetic had not yet penetrated Bengal. For in the first year of Shah Jahan's reign, 1628-29, the Khondokar Tola mosque at Sherpur was completed, a building clearly inspired by the nearby Kherua mosque of 1582 (Plate 51), indicating a reliance on local building traditions. This singleaisled brick-constructed mosque was provided by Sadr Jahan, a local religious official.

Shortly after this, however, building styles began to reflect those at Mughal centers throughout India. Several monuments of this period remain in Dhaka, an important mercantile center and military outpost. An cIdgah of 1640-41 and a serai known as the Bara Katra, dated between 1643 anc^ 1646, were provided by cAbd al-Qasim, the administrator there. Little remains today of his oncesplendid serai. Its multi-storied entrance gate, however, still stands and is similar to A<sup>c</sup> zam Khan's serai entrance in Ahmadabad built less than a decade earlier (Plate 135). The cIdgah was modeled closely on Saif Khan's Patna cIdgah of 1628.

The mosque inside Dhaka's Lalbagh fort, dated 1649, is typical of Shah Jahan-period architecture in Bengal (Plate 154). For example, the faceted recessed arches of the central entrance are also seen on the nearby Bara Katra and the contemporary mosques of Rajmahal. Its cusped arches and rows of recessed niches give this single-aisled three-bayed mosque a more refined quality than those in contemporary Rajmahal. In spite of its fluted domes, an eighteenth-century restoration, it remains the best example of the fully mature Mughal mosque-type of this period in Bengal.53

Rajmahal (Akbarnagar), not Dhaka, was the capital of Bengal between 1639 and 1659. Shah Shujac , one of Shah Jahan's sons, resided there as governor. A great deal was built at Rajmahal during his governorship. Although Shah Shujac was a prince, he was not in Shah Jahan's eyes a serious contender for the throne. He, however, aspired to kingship and was the first of Shah Jahan's sons

to declare himself emperor when he believed his father was dying in 1657. His buildings in Rajmahal and elsewhere in Bengal reflect his imperial aspirations.

He provided Rajmahal with a palace, although only a small portion of it remains. Europeans who visited it describe a splendid complex whose grounds were divided into a series of symmetrically arranged quadrangles, suggesting that the palace plan was similar to the design of imperial palaces at Agra and Lahore. The best preserved surviving palace building, known as the Sangi Dalan (Plate 155), has a curved *bangala* roof on the side that overlooks the Ganges, recalling those at Shah Jahan's Lai Mahal in Bari and the Agra fort's windows at which the emperor presented himself to the public (Plates 113 and 127). Polished black stone pillars, essentially simple versions of those on Shah Jahan's Shalimar garden pavilion in Kashmir, support three cusped arches. Overlooking the river, this chamber was used by the prince, possibly as his private quarters or perhaps as a public viewing balcony, functions also suggested by notations on early plans made by European visitors.

Lining the main road between the palace and Raja Man Singh's earlier Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque are several mosques apparently built during this time. Above the central doorway of these brick buildings are recessed panels that once held dedicatory slabs, all of them now lost. Nevertheless, the Sirsi mosque, the Raushan mosque, and the Mahagan Toli mosque, among others, probably date

to the time Shah Shujac was governor. They all bear features similar to those on the mosque Shah Shujac built immediately across from his palace. Among these features are the four corner turrets, an established Bengali form, and engaged columns flanking the central entrance. While the patrons of these Rajmahal mosques remain unknown, probably none of these small structures was built by the governor himself. Just as Bernier observed that Shah Jahan's nobles at their own expense embellished much of Shahjahanabad to gain favor with the emperor, so, too, in Rajmahal, we may imagine nobles and wealthy merchants, eager to curry favor with Shah Shujac , the governor, took upon themselves the responsibility of embellishing his capital city.

Shah Shujac not only built at his city of Rajmahal, he also capitalized on the religious significance of Gaur, the ancient citadel of the independent Bengal sultans. Even in a city such as this, with its own established architectural tradition, the Mughal style now prevailed. The focus of Gaur's sacral significance long had been the Qadam Rasul, a domed square-plan structure that had been built in 1530, well before the Mughal conquest of Bengal. Housing an impression said to be the Prophet Muhammad's footprint, the shrine's importance continued into Mughal times. Shah Shujac embellished the grounds of the Qadam Rasul. He built rest houses and a monumental gate known as the

Lukochori Darwaza (Plate 156), a three-storied gateway rendered entirely in the imperial Mughal manner, radically different from the earlier architecture of Gaur.

In addition, Shah Shujac granted his spiritual mentor, Shah Nic mat Allah, funds to construct a mosque, *khanqah* and other buildings in Gaur's southern suburb. This area, known as Firuzpur, is today just inside the Bangladesh border. The tomb appears to be modeled on the ground floor of Ic timad al-Daula's tomb in Agra (Plate 71). The mosque is the single-aisled three-bayed type so popular in Rajmahal during this time. The proportionately small entrance arch lends a weighty quality to the mosque, reminiscent of the older Gaur style. While the mosque's exterior has no net patterning in stucco, it does appear in the central mihrab and pedentives of the interior, recalling the Raushan mosque in Rajmahal datable to the mid-seventeenth century. By providing these buildings in Gaur, Shah Shujac attempted to revive the status of the former Bengal capital and to associate his name with this revival.

#### BUILDINGS UNDER THE NON-MUSLIM NOBILITY

Shah Jahan, more orthodox than his predecessors, is generally depicted as considerably less tolerant of non-Muslims. His destruction of Hindu temples,

for example, is often cited. However, he did so only near the beginning of his reign and then largely for political purposes, not iconoclastic ones. His destruction of the enormous temple at Orchha in 1635, for example, was an imperial response to long-term rebellion on the part of the raja Jhajar Singh.54 Similarly, some believe that Shah Jahan's demolition of the Mewar raja's renovations of the Chitor fort was intended as an anti-Hindu expression. It was, however, a tactical measure. The raja's renovations had not been authorized, thus breaking an older agreement. Moreover, Shah Jahan wished to insure that his long-time Mughal opponent, recently turned unwilling ally, did not develop a secure base for attack.55

All the same it is notable that few significant or large-scale temples in north India date to this period, except in Bengal, an area of considerable distance from the center. Instead, most structures erected by non-Muslims are secular. They are either palaces or fortified structures built by vassal princes, largely Rajput, or they are domestic and public structures built by non-Muslim Mughal nobles in their landholdings and ancestral homes.

Among the most notable examples of the latter type are the mansion and serai of Rai Mukand Das in Narnaul. Mukand Das, a native of Narnaul, served as Shah Jahan's superintendent of grants. His multi-storied mansion is a rare example of a nobleman's house that maintains its original design without subsequent modernization. The general layout of the multi-storied interior, as well as many of the design elements, reveal an awareness of contemporary trends. The mansion is essentially organized around two small open courtyards (Plate 157). The rooms around one were probably intended for men, those around the other for women, following a model of larger Rajput palaces in Rajasthan.

Many Rajasthani princes extended older palaces or built new ones during this period. Particularly interesting are Mirza Raja Jai Singh's additions to the Kachhwaha palace at Amber. This house, more than any other in Rajasthan, continued to serve the Mughals loyally and was highly valued by them. Jai Singh ascended the throne of Amber in 1622, near the end of Jahangir's reign, and died in 1667, ten years into Aurangzeb's reign. Like his great-grandfather, Raja Man Singh, he was the most powerful non-Muslim noble in the Mughal empire. Unlike his great-grandfather, however, Jai Singh invested little money in architecture outside his ancestral domain, but built lavish additions to the Amber palace.

Work on Mirza Jai Singh's Amber palace was underway by 1637, for in that year Shah Jahan issued a decree *(farman)* ordering Jai Singh to cease work on his buildings there since all the marble cutters were needed for work at Agra, the imperial capital. The Amber palace probably was completed considerably

later, near the end of Shah Jahan's reign or even at the beginning of Aurangzeb's reign, after the imperial demand for Makrana marble lessened. The most notable structures added by Jai Singh include the white marble temple constructed to house an image of Shila Mata brought from Bengal by Man Singh and the buildings around two courtyards north of Man Singh's

zenana. The northernmost of these two courtyards is situated on an elevated terrace above the palace's large entrance court. In its northeast corner is a pillared Audience Hall. The style of this hall makes it difficult to date. Either it was built by Raja Man Singh before his death in 1614, or early in Jai Singh's reign. Constructed of pink and cream stone, the Public Audience Hall is a rectangular pavilion supported on all four sides by two rows of columns. The resulting plan is similar to buildings constructed since Akbar's time and associated with imperial presence. The faceted pillars on the exterior have bases that recall the carving on those at the Private Audience Hall at Fatehpur Sikri, as do the brackets (Plate 32).

At the southern end of this courtyard is the Ganesh Pol, or Elephant gate (Plate 15 8), named for its painted depiction of the Hindu elephant-headed deity of auspicious beginnings on its central entrance. It serves as a monumental gateway into the palace's private quarters. This gate, with its high entrance arch, is derived in general plan and elevation from Mughal gates. However, the overall

appearance is considerably lighter and more delicate than any imperial project. Further contributing to his delicate appearance are the floral sprays and arabesques painted over the entire facade. The emphasis on the structure's height, characteristic of late seventeenth-century architecture, suggests that it was built late in Jai Singh's reign.

The Ganesh Pol leads to a magnificent quadrangle which more than any other part of this palace is based on Shah Jahan's palace pavilions (Plate 113). The most impressive building here is the double-storied Jai Mandir, also called the Shish Mahal (Plate 159). It is centrally positioned on the east overlooking the lake below. Its second story is covered with a curved *bangala-type* roof, inspired by that on Shah Jahan's public viewing balcony at the Agra fort. The use of this curved roof suggests that it was provided after Aurangzeb assumed the throne. After his accession, forms such as the baluster column and *bangala* roof, once reserved for imperial use, came to be more broadly based. The interior, too, resembles Shah Jahan's palace buildings. On the ground floor, the dado has carved floral sprays, more closely spaced than on imperial prototypes. The net and stellate vaulting of the ceiling is encrusted with mirrors, recalling the decor of pavilions at the Lahore fort's Shah Burj (Plate 107). This area, in front of the older women's quarters, probably served as the raja's quarters.

Although Hindu temples were constructed in various parts of India throughout Shah Jahan's reign, especially in princely Rajasthan, the only region where temple construction has been systematically studied is Bengal. As noted in the previous chapter, terracotta temples there during the Mughal period took on an increasing regional character, borrowing from both the pre-Mughal Islamic architecture of Bengal and also well-established Hindu traditions. During Shah Jahan's period, the regional temple types continued to be constructed. For example, a temple dedicated to Raghunatha at Ghurisa (Birbhum District) is dated 1639. It has a *chau chala* roof (a vault with four curved sides that meet at a curved central ridge), a type characteristic of Bengali architecture at this time. A second temple-type developed, called a *ratna* temple, which was surmounted by several spires. The Gokula-Chand temple of 1639 at Gokulnagar and the Shyam Raya temple of 1643 at Bishnupur, both in Bankura District, are of this type. Each is surmounted with a central octagonal pavilion and flanked by a spire at each of the roof's four corners. While temples such as this had virtually no impact on architectural traditions outside of Bengal after this period, they represent an important regional form, indicating the continuing evolution of Hindu architecture under Muslim rulers.

#### CONCLUSION

Shah Jahan's active involvement in the design and production of architecture far exceeded that of any other Mughal emperor. Themes initially established in the buildings of his predecessors were finely honed and reached maturity under Shah Jahan. For example, the long-standing notion that imperial Mughal mausolea were symbols of paradise was manifest most precisely in the Taj Mahal. More than any other ruler, Shah Jahan sought to use architecture to project the emperor's formal and semi-divine character. He did so, in part, by adapting motifs found in western art and indigenous Indian architecture, such as the baluster column and baldachin covering, giving them a unique imperial context. The charged meaning of these motifs, however, is only found in Shah Jahan's reign, for they are seen on the earliest non-imperial structures of his successor's reign. He built many more mosques than did his predecessors and used this building type to project his official image as the upholder of Islam. This is a trend which accelerates under Aurangzeb, Shah Jahan's son and successor.

Just as the symbolic content of Mughal architecture peaks under Shah Jahan, so, too, the style favored by this ruler introduces a new classicism in form and medium. Favored is white marble or burnished stucco surfaces that emulate marble. While marble had been used sparingly by Akbar and Jahangir, it dominates Shah Jahan's palace pavilions, mosques, and the most important tomb he constructed, the Taj Mahal. The marble on secular structures, most notably palace pavilions, often is elaborately inlaid with multi-colored precious stones and at times ornately carved. By contrast, the marble surface of religious buildings, especially mosques, remains considerably more austere, suggesting a division between secular and sacred arts not seen previously. Even enormous public structures, such as his Jamic mosque of Shahjahanabad, while faced primarily with red sandstone, were profusely inlaid with white marble.

Shah Jahan's architectural style is deeply rooted in the buildings of his predecessors. The tomb of Mumtaz Mahal marks a return to Humayun's Timurid tomb-type, and indeed the interest in elaborate Timurid vaulting types is heightened in Shah Jahan's reign. Trabeated pavilions, as seen in earlier Mughal reigns, grace Shah Jahan's palaces, hunting estates and gardens. Now, however, there is an emphasis unprecedented in Mughal architecture on the structure's graceful lines and a harmonious balance among all the parts.

Shah Jahan's personal involvement in architecture and city planning appears to have motivated others, especially the high-ranking women of his court, to build. While the emperor provided palace buildings and forts, these women and the nobility assumed responsibility for embellishing the cities. Nowhere is this seen more clearly than in his *de novo* city, Shahjahanabad, where mosques, gardens, markets, serais and mansions were provided by the aristocracy.

#### CONCLUSION

As in other reigns, the nobility built in the provinces and areas outside the capital. The number of surviving structures is great, reminding us that the mechanisms of Mughal economy encouraged constant spending and cash flow. Although we know less about the emperor's reaction to these buildings than we do about Jahangir's response to structures built by his nobles in the provinces, we see the strength of the elegant imperial taste promulgated by the emperor: it is widely emulated across India.
