# CHAPTER 1

# PRECEDENTS FOR MUGHAL ARCHITECTURE

In 1526 a descendant of the Iranian house of Timur, Zahir al-Din Muhammad Babur, better known today simply as Babur, defeated the last ruler of the Lodi dynasty in a battle at Panipat, about 90 km north of Delhi. The Lodis were one of many short-lived Islamic houses that had ruled over much of the Indian subcontinent since the Islamic conquest of this area in 1192. Babur and his successors, who continued to rule north India until 1858, were known as the Mughals, a term Babur would not have liked, for originally it had a pejorative connotation. In contemporary eyes Babur's victory over Ibrahim Lodi was no more consequential than the frequent campaigns that brought changes in ruling power. However, well before the year 1600, during the reign of Babur's grandson, Akbar, it was clear that Mughal rule made a substantial impact on the cultural, economic, and political development of the lands it controlled - an area then called Hindustan. In the realm of architecture, the Mughals achieved master-builder status, producing monuments such as the Taj Mahal, which even today is considered one of the world's most magnificent buildings.

Unlike the contemporary and powerful Islamic rulers of Iran and Turkey, the Safavids and Ottomans, the Mughals ruled a land dominated by non-Muslims, largely Hindus. Just as indigenous religions and traditions were tolerated and in many cases even respected by the Mughal rulers, so, too, they incorporated in their patronage of the arts, literature and music many indigenous elements. Over their 300-year rule, Mughal attitudes toward the indigenous Indian population - Hindu and Muslim — varied; so did Mughal adaptation of earlier Indian art forms. During the earliest days of Mughal patronage, little attention was paid to India's non-Islamic architectural traditions; however, during the reign of the third Mughal ruler, Akbar (15 56-1605), indigenous Indian elements, both Hindu and Muslim, were incorporated consciously into Mughal structures. In subsequent Mughal architecture, patrons often abandoned the use of indigenous elements, seeking instead forms and symbols that might affirm the Islamic character of the Mughal house.

Mughal architecture is the product of innovative genius that borrowed from Indian, Timurid and even European sources. The Mughal artists interpreted these borrowed forms, both in terms of symbolism and style, to their own purposes. However, to imagine, as many do, that Mughal architecture was the first to make extensive use of indigenous motifs along with standard Islamic

forms - for example, domes and arches - is to overlook the heritage bequeathed to them by earlier Indo-Islamic dynasties.

## SOURCES OF MUGHAL INSPIRATION

## Indian Muslim sources

## The Delhi Sultanate, 1192–1451

Among the earliest remaining Islamic monuments in India are the foundations of walled city and mosque at Banbhore near Thatta in Sind, Pakistan. The site was commenced shortly after the birth of Islam, and is probably the earliest Arab settlement in the South Asian continent. Other remains indicating an early Islamic presence include a tomb dated to the mid-twelfth century found at Bhadreshvar in the coastal regions of Gujarat in western India. Another aspect of Islamic presence was the periodic incursions, more destructive than constructive, intended to take booty, not to build any record of a permanent presence. The incursions into India made by Mahmud of Ghazni in the eleventh century were of this sort. However, in 1192, Qutb al-Din Aibek, a military commander of the Afghan Ghorid dynasty, defeated the last Hindu ruler of Delhi. Within a few years, a great deal of north India was under Ghorid control, and in 1206 Aibek asserted his independence from the Ghorids, declaring himself sultan of India. He and his successors built architecture that served as one foundation of Mughal art.

Among the first concerns of the conqueror was the construction of a congregational (Jamic) mosque, necessary for the legitimization of the sultan in this newly acquired territory as well as for the establishment and spread of Islam. Aibek's first mosque, significantly now called the Quwwat al-Islam or Might of Islam, was erected in Delhi, the capital of the new Muslim rulers (Plate 1). Constructed from the architectural members of temples, the mosque in its first phases appears to be modeled loosely on a common form of Ghorid-period mosques. Such mosques, following a general Iranian fashion, had a central open courtyard surrounded by cloistered halls on three sides; the prayer chamber was on the fourth side.<sup>1</sup> Each side had a central vaulted entrance or *aiwan*. Hence, such mosques are known as four-aiwan types. In India their appearance is somewhat modified, and by the Mughal period the term *aiwan* assumes a different meaning. During this early period entrances are not vaulted. The prayer chamber is situated on the west, the side that in India faces Mecca, thus the direction toward which all Indian mosques are oriented. Variations of this Iranian four-*aiwan* plan continue to be constructed even through the Mughal

period. In elevation, however, the Quwwat al-Islam mosque initially followed traditional Indian building techniques. That is, the building in its initial phase was strictly trabeated, built in the post-and-lintel system. This contrasts to the more common arcuated or vaulted building types found throughout most Muslim-dominated lands. In Indo-Islamic architecture, however, trabeated buildings continued even through the Mughal period as one major mode of construction. As we shall see, to assume as most writers have done that all trabeated structures, especially in the case of Akbar's Fatehpur Sikri, are a revival or even conscious adaptation of Hindu forms is erroneous.

Aibek was evidently aware that his mosque, constructed entirely of elements pillaged from Hindu and Jain monuments, resembled more a rearranged temple than a traditional mosque. In 1198 he thus constructed an arched screen (Plate 2) across the front of the prayer chamber so his mosque might more closely mirror those in his homeland. This screen is richly adorned with vertical bands of carved calligraphy and naturalistically growing vines. While Arabic lettering, in this case verses from the Quran, typically embellishes the facade of prayer chambers throughout the Islamic world, the appearance of naturalistic, organic forms is a good deal more unusual. These naturalistic forms, in lieu of the more flattened, abstracted patterns generally found in the Ghorids' Iranian homelands, doubtless can be traced to Indian masons continuing to work in indigenous modes.

A rapidly growing Muslim population necessitated a larger mosque. Thus Aibek's structure was doubled in size by his son-in-law and successor, Iltutmish. Before the prayer chamber he also constructed an arched screen whose ornamentation differed from that of Aibek's. The motifs on Iltutmish's screen relate closely to those seen on Ghorid structures, for example the Shah-i Mashhad Madrasa in Ghargistan, north Afghanistan. They are more abstract than those on Aibek's screen and carved in a deep flat relief. The overall appearance is that of a rich tapestry, almost a *horror vacui* design. This tendency toward intense patterning over an entire stone-carved surface reappears in the early phases of Mughal architecture. Profuse surface decoration is characteristic of much Islamic ornamentation, not just that of India.

Under Iltutmish, the subcontinent's first monumental tombs were built. One, known today as the Sultan Ghari tomb, was constructed for his son, and a second was built for himself, both in Delhi. The interior of Iltutmish's own square-plan tomb was embellished in a fashion similar to his screen at the Quwwat al-Islam mosque. Some thirty chapters of the Quran are engraved on the tomb's interior walls. The themes of the chapters selected from these inscriptions include the oneness of God, the obligations of the devout, and the power of God - all themes of inscriptions on the Quwwat al-Islam mosque and its minaret, the Qutb Minar, both constructed under Aibek and Iltutmish. A new theme was introduced in the inscriptions of Iltutmish's tomb, one that

![](_page_4_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 2. Screen of Aibek's Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque, known as the Quwwat al-Islam Mosque, Delhi

became especially important for the Mughals, that is, eternal paradise as a reward for the true believer on the Day of Judgment.<sup>2</sup> Thus commences in India the tradition of paradisical imagery for tomb construction. Under the Mughals and culminating with the Taj Mahal, this theme came to be used with extraordinary effect, not only in inscriptions but in the entire conception of the monument.

No major Islamic structures remain in India that date between the death of Iltutmish in 1235 and the beginning of the fourteenth century. However, under the Khalji Sultan cAla al-Din (ruled 1296-1316), architecture assumed renewed importance. Focusing on the monument that remained symbolically paramount, cAla al-Din expanded the Quwwat al-Islam mosque to triple its original size. Although the project was never completed, its vast scale mirrors the ambitions of a prince who wished to become a second Alexander the Great. He sought to incorporate not only south India into his domain, but China as

*<sup>2</sup>* Anthony Welch, "Qur'an and Tomb: The Religious Epigraphs of Two Early Sultanate Tombs in Delhi," in Frederick M. Asher and G. S. Gai (eds.), *Indian Epigraphy: Its Bearing on the History of Art* (New Delhi, 1985), pp. 256-67.

well. In fact, the only remaining parts of the Khalji addition to the Quwwat al-Islam mosque complex are an enormous unfinished minaret, pillared galleries and an entrance portal on the south, known commonly as the cAlai Darwaza (Plate 3). Dated 13 n , many epigraphs on this gate are not Quranic, but hyperbole praising its patron, Sultan cAla al-Din Khalji. Although it is not a monumental structure, it is one that later builders, among them the early Mughals looked upon as a source of inspiration.

A square-plan gate, its layout adheres closely to that of Iltutmish's tomb. In ornamentation, however, major differences exist. The exterior of Iltutmish's tomb is austere, composed largely of plain dressed stones. In contrast, the cAlai Darwaza's facade as well as interior is entirely faced with carved stones. This ornamentation appears to be based on both indigenous Indian traditions as well as non-Indian Islamic patterns. For example, the Arabic lettering, flat-cut stencil-like arabesques, battlement motifs *{kungura)* and geometric patterns derive from earlier Iranian traditions, while the carved lotus medallions and budded creepers are adaptations of earlier Indian motifs.

By the Khalji period, Indo-Islamic culture had come into its own. Underscoring this is the contemporary work of Amir Khusrau, still considered one of the greatest Indian poets. Writing in Persian, the official language of most Muslim courts and kings in India, Khusrau used motifs such as the parrot, mangoes and flowers only found in India to supplement Persianate imagery, such as cedars and tulips, alien to the subcontinent. By this time, many motifs - architectural and literary - had no strictly sectarian connotation. To call a motif Hindu or Muslim has little meaning, for elements such as the lotus or even trabeated architecture, still found in parts of cAla al-Din's extension to the Quwwat al-Islam mosque, are now part of a well-established architectural tradition developed under the Indian sultans.

The cAlai Darwaza is covered with carved stones and calligraphy that give the appearance of a richly textured surface. Long strips of white marble, used frequently for calligraphic bands, effectively stand out against the red sandstone ground of the facade. This concern for contrasting colors on a facade, also seen for example on the Khalji-period Ukha mosque in Bayana, probably ultimately is derived from the architectural traditions of the Turkish Seljuks. A memory of Seljuk design was brought to India by nobles, intellectuals and artisans fleeing the invading Mongols. Multi-colored facades of inlaid stone are seen rarely over the next 200 years; however, beginning in the early sixteenth century, facades inlaid with multi-colored stone are seen with greater frequency. There is reason to believe that the cAlai Darwaza served as a direct source of inspiration for these structures, which in turn were the inspiration for the ornamentation on buildings such as the tomb of Ataga Khan (Plate 16), constructed early in Akbar's reign, or the Fatehpur Sikri Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque.

Following the Khaljis, the Tughluqs emerged as the ruling power. Assuming

![](_page_6_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 3. cAlai Darwaza, Quwwat al-Islam mosque, Delhi

control in 1320 over an area that included much of the Indian subcontinent, their territory quickly diminished as provincial governors declared independence from central authority, leaving them little more than Delhi and its suburbs. While the dynasty nominally survived until 1412, Delhi was sacked in 1399 by the invasion of Timur, the ancestor of the Mughals.

The Tughluqs were prolific providers of architecture, especially under the third ruler, Firuz Shah (r. 1351-88), whose extensive building campaigns were in a sense a cover for his politically weak regime. In general, architecture under the Tughluqs became increasingly austere into the fourteenth century. For example, richly carved stone facades and interiors were replaced with plain stucco veneers, and Quranic inscriptions rarely embellished any structure. While Tughluq buildings may have been painted, multi-colored stones on their surface were rare. With the exception of the *iour-aiwan* mosque type, few of the architectural forms and little of the ornamentation developed in their reign appear to have had any direct bearing on Mughal buildings. Nevertheless, the work of the Tughluqs foreshadows aspects of Mughal architecture.

Firuz Shah Tughluq constructed extensive earthworks, mosques, schools for religious instruction (madrasa), as well as other edifices that were aimed at enhancing the religious and economic well-being of his subjects. While such projects fit well with the theoretical duty of a good Islamic ruler, in India no sultan hitherto had built public works so extensively. The Mughals

subsequently did so, and like their Tughlug predecessors, they also provided support for the benefit of all subjects. For example, the Tughlug sultans and nobles endowed Hindu temples;<sup>3</sup> so, too, under the Mughal dynasty, was patronage provided for Hindu monuments. Even the Mughal Aurangzeb, traditionally considered an iconoclast and temple destroyer, gave orders for the protection of Hindus and their temples.<sup>4</sup> And some Hindu nobles under the Mughals provided funds for Islamic buildings.

The tomb of the first Tughlug ruler, Ghivas al-Din, reflects a further development in paradisical imagery. While not unique to India, this imagery is developed most fully in funereal architecture during the Mughal period. Ghiyas al-Din's tomb is located slightly to the west of this sultan's massive Delhi fortress, Tughluqabad. Originally connected to it by a long arched bridge, the tomb is situated within pentagonal walls that mirror the nearby larger fort. Today the square-plan tomb sits in the midst of grain fields, but originally it was surrounded by a vast body of water, making the tomb, already protected by sloping enclosure walls, even more inaccessible.

It has been suggested that the tomb's fortress-like design reflects the political instability of the time and that it was constructed during Ghivas al-Din's own life so that he could use it to protect himself against foes. However, such a structure could not provide long-term protection; rather, its setting in a pool of water evokes numerous references in the Quran to the abundant waters of paradise, an image so precious to the desert dwellers of Arabia, Islam's birthplace. This pool refers to the tank at which believers quench their thirst when entering paradise. The association of water with funereal structures to denote paradise will continue as a major motif in Mughal architecture.

While Iltutmish's tomb is a virtual storehouse of Quranic verse and Ghiyas al-Din Tughlug's tomb is a private vision of paradise, Firuz Shah Tughlug's tomb is austere, appropriate for its location in the midst of an Islamic theological college. Also in the grounds of this madrasa, in close proximity to Firuz Shah's tomb, are small kiosk-like structures known as *chattris*. They have domed superstructures supported by six or eight pillars. These *chattris* mark the graves of deceased saints or men of sufficient piety to be buried in the school's grounds. The nearby tomb of Firuz Shah overlooks a large tank, an appropriate location for a tomb. The tomb, characteristic of its period, is square in plan. The exterior walls have a thick unembellished stucco veneer. The interior is also stucco faced, generally plain, although the interior of the dome is incised and polychromed to evoke an image of the heavens. In addition to medallions and floral designs, the dome is inscribed with verses from the

Quran and sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad *(hadis).* The hope of paradise is a principal theme of these verses, a theme that will dominate the iconography of Mughal tombs.

## *The successor states of the Tughluqs*

As central Tughluq authority over regional territories weakened, Tughluq governors asserted their independence, creating a series of successor states. In the case of Deccani and Bengali governors, ties were severed with the Tughluq masters as early as the mid-fourteenth century. Gradually through the early fifteenth century other governors declared independence. Most of these regions remained autonomous until the very beginning of the Mughal period. Artistic trends to a large extent reflect political ones. That is, structures constructed in these areas during Tughluq domination or shortly thereafter are modeled closely on the Tughluq architecture of Delhi. For example, the first congregational mosque of the Ilyas Shahi dynasty (1352-1415; 1433-86) in Bengal, the Adina mosque of Pandua built in 1374, is inspired in both plan and overall appearance by Muhammad Shah Tughluq's congregational mosque in Delhi, commonly known as the Begumpuri mosque (c. 1343). So is the earlyfourteenth century Atala mosque in Jaunpur, the first congregational mosque of the Sharqi dynasty. However, buildings constructed after the initial phase of independence generally use plans and motifs indigenous to their area. This, as we shall see, is a pattern also reflected in some of the late Mughal architecture of the provinces.

The most dramatic examples of distinctly regional style are found in the architectural traditions of Bengal and Gujarat. In Bengal, the form of the village hut with its sloping roof, well suited for heavy rains, was adapted for tombs and mosques, for example the mosque of Baba Adam (1483) in Rampal, today located in Dhaka District, Bangladesh, and the Eklakhi tomb in Pandua, West Bengal, datable to the fifteenth century. Probably the curved roof was used in palace architecture as well, but we have no surviving examples. Similar roofs are common in Mughal architecture commencing around the mid-seventeenth century. Such roofs were called *bangala* in Mughal documents and were often used by the end of the seventeenth century far from Bengal in Mughal architecture.

Few other connections link architecture produced under the independent sultans of Bengal with monuments subsequently erected under the Mughals. For example, the delicate brick work seen in the Tantipora mosque in Gaur or the exquisite stone carving on the Adina mosque in Pandua had little influence on subsequent Mughal monuments. While a few motifs - among them the bell and chain - are common to the architecture of both Sultanate Bengal and the Mughals, these motifs are seen also in the Sultanate architecture of other realms, notably Gujarat. Thus the claim of Akbar's chronicler, Abu al-Fazl, that the

"fine styles of Bengal" were crucial in the development of Akbari architecture is little substantiated by the remains themselves.

In Gujarat, as in Bengal, architecture under the newly established Ahmad Shahi dynasty (1408—1578) assumed a distinctly regional character. Features found commonly on tombs, mosques and saints' shrines *(dargahs)* include ones such as serpentine-like gateways *(toranas)* or lintels above prayer niches (mihrabs), bell-and-chain motifs carved on pillars and walls, pillars supporting corbelled domes and ceiling insets, and carved panels often depicting trees, all ultimately derived from Gujarati temple traditions. Because of these borrowings, some scholars have assumed a conscious and continued Hindu influence. More likely, however, these features were first used by local Hindu artisans contracted to work on the Islamic architecture of the area, and their form, but not their original meaning, became assimilated into the standard architectural repertoire. Thus when many of these same ideas appear in the architecture of Akbar, there is no reason to associate them with any particular sectarian tradition.

Such features are not limited to Gujarat. They are also features of architecture in Mandu, related politically and geographically to Gujarat, and in Chanderi. For example, serpentine brackets, seen on the mid-fifteenth-century mosque at Sarkhej, Gujarat, also appear on the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque in Chanderi and on the tomb of Hoshang Shah in Mandu. Similarly, inlaid white marble was a dominant building material in both Gujarat and Mandu. The concurrent use of such features throughout western and part of north-central India has significance for Mughal architecture, where these features are common. It is generally assumed that artisans for Akbar's palaces came from Gujarat, but the widespread use of such motifs opens the possibility that they came from a greater area.

More important than the borrowing of individual motifs from Gujarat is the overall influence of the fifteenth-century *dargab* of Shaikh Ahmad Khattu of Sarkhej on the design of Mughal tombs. This tomb, situated outside of Ahmadabad, is a white marble shrine whose facade is embellished with pierced carved screens *(jalis).* Both the material and screens became major features of Mughal architecture. In addition, the tomb's plan as well as the juxtaposed colored stones used on the flooring had a major impact on Mughal mausolea.

The early structures erected by the independent rulers in the Deccan, as in the north, adhered closely to Tughluq models. However, unlike the monuments of Gujarat and Bengal, Deccani architecture was subject to the influence of Iranian Seljuk and Timurid forms in the course of developing its own regional styles. Although this Seljuk influence has no bearing on Mughal art, the Timurid influence is of concern here, for the Deccan felt the impact of Iranian Timurid tradition before north India. For example, intersecting pendentives, a Timurid device, appear in Bidar on the tomb of Sultan Kalim Allah (d. 1527), shortly before they are used in north India. It is thus possible that the Mughals, descended from Timurid ancestors, did not directly import the tradition of their heritage when they came to India but adopted Timurid forms from the Deccan. There is, however, no real evidence for the movement of artistic styles from south to north.

## *Immediate Mughal precedents: the Lodi and Sur traditions*

After some hundred years, during which Delhi enjoyed little prestige, the Afghan-descended Lodi dynasty (1451-1526) made vigorous efforts to revive the city's status. They vanquished their enemies, the Sharqis of Jaunpur, and soon afterward commenced extensive building in Delhi itself. Certain motifs on Lodi buildings are identical to those seen earlier only at Jaunpur. This is the case, for example, with engaged colonettes embellished with an interwoven pattern on the Bara Gumbad, almost certainly built as a ceremonial entrance to the Bagh-i Jud, known today as Lodi Gardens, the burial grounds for the Lodi rulers. This suggests that artists were taken to Delhi from Jaunpur, until then considered the cultural center of Islamic India, in an attempt to revive the prestige of the traditional capital. The revival of Delhi was accelerated under the reigns of the first two Mughals, Babur and Humayun, who succeeded the Lodis. Their architecture is the subject of the next chapter. Following their reign, however, Mughal authority in India was briefly interrupted when the Delhi throne was assumed in 1540 by the Afghan ruler, Sher Shah Sur and his successors (1538-55). Although fifteen years of Mughal rule separated the periods of Lodi and Sur authority, the architecture produced under these two Afghan dynasties can be discussed simultaneously since it is close in form and spirit.

Under the Lodis a new type of mosque developed, one that ultimately became a major type in Mughal India. In lieu of the large congregational mosque favored under earlier Sultanate dynasties, small single-aisled mosques composed usually of three or five bays were constructed. Although it is not fully understood how or why this type was developed, a Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque constructed by Sultan Sikandar Lodi and dated 1494, commonly known as the Bara Gumbad mosque in Delhi's Lodi Gardens (Plate 4), appears to be the first example. Subsequent examples include the Moth-ki Masjid, built in Delhi about 1510 by Sikandar Lodi's prime minister, and the Jamali mosque, probably built shortly after the Mughal conquest of India but in this Lodi style. The Jamali mosque was built adjacent to the house of Jamali (d. 1536), a poet and saint favored by the Lodis as well as by the first Mughals, Humayun and Babur. It represents a mature example of the small single-aisled type. The facades of these mosques show one or more of the following features not seen on mosques in Delhi since the Khalji era, yet important for the subsequent development of

![](_page_11_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 4. Jamic mosque, Lodi Gardens, Delhi

much Mughal mosque architecture: inlaid colored stones Qamali mosque), calligraphy (Sikandar Lodi's Jamic mosque), and a high central portal *(pishtaq)* on all these mosques, suggesting a renewed interest in the monumental appearance of the facade.

Within the walls of Sher Shah Sur's citadel, known today as the Purana Qal<sup>c</sup> a in Delhi, is a magnificent single-aisled mosque that was probably the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque of this Sur sultan (Plate 5). The citadel was commenced by the second Mughal, Humayun, but was probably finished by Sher Shah (r. 1538-45), an Afghan usurper, after he expelled the Mughals from Hindustan in 1540. Although this mosque, today known as the Qal<sup>c</sup> a-i Kuhna mosque, is attributed by some to Humayun, it follows forms and utilizes motifs seen on at least one other building of Sher Shah, the tomb he erected for his grandfather at Narnaul. Moreover, it shares little in common with any extant building of Humayun. Its use of calligraphy and contrasting colored stones on the richly textured exterior evokes the appearance of cAla al-Din Khalji's cAlai Darwaza. Significantly, Sher Shah's government revived many of the administrative features of cAla al-Din's own government. Sher Shah associated these features with the revival of the Delhi Sultanate's prestige. Abu al-Fazl, Akbar's official chronicler, guardedly applauded these revived administrative features in spite of Mughal contempt for this Afghan upstart. Not only is the overall appearance of this mosque's facade important for the future development of Mughal architecture, but also many details found there influence subsequent building. On the mosque, many features are presented in an only slightly less sophisticated manner than in Akbar's own architecture. They are here more developed than on any prototype, thus in a sense serving as a bridge to subsequent Mughal ornamentation.

Plate 5. Qal<sup>c</sup> a-i Kuhna mosque, Delhi

The single-aisled plan is used exclusively for Lodi- and Sur-period Jami<sup>c</sup> mosques and for many lesser mosques in those periods as well. Still, simple multi-aisled multi-bayed mosques, often trabeated and flat-roofed, continued to be constructed across India. Examples include the Sangi mosque in Phulwari Sharif, Bihar, dated 1549-50, and the Chowk-ki Masjid, dated i553,inNagaur, Rajasthan. Trabeated, flat-roofed structures continue a long-standing Indian tradition. They in no way represent a style that can be classified as non-Islamic.

Before the Lodis, elaborate tombs were built only for kings, members of the royal family and highly venerated saints. Although there were only three Lodi kings, more than a hundred large tombs constructed under Lodi auspices remain in Delhi alone, many times the number of tombs built under earlier regimes. Since surely there were not a hundred saints worthy of elaborate tombs during this brief period, the explanation appears to lie in the attitude toward kingship under the Lodis.<sup>5</sup> The sultan under earlier Indo-Islamic dynasties had been regarded as autocratic, a ruler whose power was absolute. The Lodis, however, were a tribe from Afghanistan. Although they were long settled in India, members of other Afghan tribes formed their support. These

<sup>5</sup> Matsuo Ara, "The Lodhi Rulers and the Construction of Tomb-Buildings in Delhi," *Ada Asiatica,* 43, 1982, 71-80.

tribal chiefs viewed a king not as an absolute but rather as a comrade who was first among equals. In this same manner, these nobles felt that they, too, should merit tombs, formerly a royal perquisite. Often the tombs of these nobles are even larger than royal ones. Generally the royal tombs were octagonal, while those of the nobles were square in plan. A typical square-plan tomb is that of Mubarak Khan in Delhi's South Extension, dated to 1481-82. Its facade is marked with multiple tiers of arched niches and windows divided by rows of string coursing, giving this single-storied structure the appearance of several stories. Mubarak Khan's tomb is surmounted by a single dome, and *chattris* mark each corner of the roof. Square-plan tombs adhering to this general plan were constructed by the Mughals as well, even into the eighteenth century.

For Sher Shah Sur the association of tomb construction with status assumed even greater importance. The only Indian sultan descending from a lowranking heritage, Sher Shah wished to fabricate an elevated genealogy to indicate that he had the requisite piety and high birth demanded of Islamic sovereigns. Shortly after he assumed the Delhi throne in 1540, this sultan constructed for his grandfather and father, each long-deceased and lowranking, enormous magnificent tombs that posthumously implied elevated status. His grandfather's tomb in Narnaul is of special interest, for not only is it a square-plan tomb of the type that had been reserved for high-ranking Lodi nobles, but also it is larger and more carefully crafted than Lodi prototypes. This enormous tomb is exquisitely rendered with contrasting grey and red stones on the facade. It serves as an immediate model for the finest Mughalperiod square-plan tombs. In Sasaram Sher Shah built for his father a huge three-tiered octagonal mausoleum, a type generally reserved for royalty, yet much larger than any Lodi prototype. Situated in the middle of a walled compound with structures usually found in a saint's shrine - a mosque, a madrasa, a serai, a hall for religious meditation and step-well - this tomb bestowed upon Sher Shah's low-ranking father the trappings of both a saint and a king.

The monumental octagonal mausoleum, completed in 1545, that Sher Shah constructed for himself, also in Sasaram, was at that time the largest tomb ever built in all India. Its setting, in the middle of an artificial lake, is a visual allusion to the abundant waters of paradise described in the Quran. Specifically this tank refers to the pool at which believers quench their thirst when entering paradise, a reference made lucid by the presence of these particular Quranic verses (108: 1-3) carved on the tomb's interior. The tomb's octagonal shape is again an allusion to the eight levels that comprise the Islamic notion of paradise. The eight-sided ambulatory around the tomb permits circumambulating the deceased, an act of veneration in itself. The symbolism apparent in this tomb anticipates that of Mughal tombs. Thus the roots of Mughal mausolea do not lie exclusively outside of India.

#### *Non-Islamic sources: IJOO-I^OO*

Although the Sultanate period is generally believed to be one of little tolerance for non-Muslims, Hindu and Jain architecture continued to be built in north India during this time. For example, at least three temples in Bihar are either dated or datable to the Sultanate period. One of them, in the Hindu pilgrimage city of Gaya, even bears an inscription praising the Muslim overlord, Firuz Shah Tughluq, a ruler traditionally considered belligerently anti-Hindu.<sup>6</sup> Some temples of this period are domed, as indicated by paintings illustrating a 1516 *Aryanyakaparvan.7* Thus domed architecture cannot be considered exclusive to the Muslims.

Secular architecture erected at this time under Hindu patrons had a substantial impact on subsequent secular buildings, notably those of the Mughals. One example, a magnificent one, is the Man Mandir palace built in Gwalior about 1500 by Raja Man Singh Tomar. Among the few buildings admired by Babur in India, the palace is rightly regarded as having influenced Akbar in the design of his own palaces. Situated atop the high flat plateau of the ancient Gwalior fort, the palace's exterior is marked with a series of circular buttresses each surmounted by a high domed *chattri,* and the facade is embellished with tiles glazed predominantly blue or yellow. While the Gwalior palace's exterior influenced the inlaid mosaic facade of the Delhi gate in Akbar's Agra fort, the interior of this palace had an even greater impact on Akbar's architecture. The main body of the palace consists of a series of small connecting courtyards around whose perimeter are galleries containing rooms. These rooms are never arcuated, but have essentially flat roofs, a type that reappears in Akbar's Agra and Fatehpur Sikri palaces. Like subsequent Mughal palaces, the Gwalior palace makes use of animal brackets supporting the gallery eaves *(chajjas),* probably ultimately modeled on *torana* motifs, that are used both as wall ornamentation as well as functional devices. While Man Singh's palace, not far from Agra and Fatehpur Sikri, had an apparent impact on Akbari architecture, it is wrong to consider the Gwalior palace uniquely Hindu in form. Rather, it belongs to a type of domestic architecture that late in the Sultanate period was utilized by both Hindus and non-Hindus.

#### *The Iranian tradition*

In spite of a long-standing Islamic heritage in India, Mughal rulers considered themselves the rightful heirs of the Iranian Timurid tradition, which they felt

was superior to Indo-Islamic culture. Important among Timurid artistic traditions adopted by the Mughals are those that had been maintained and further refined by a Timurid successor state, the Shaibanis of Bukhara. Their rule was contemporary with the beginnings of a Mughal domination of India. Thus, despite the fact that Safavid rule and artistic expression dominated most of the Iranian world, the Shaibanis provided a conduit for the transmission of Timurid architectural forms.<sup>8</sup>

Mughal architecture adopted from Timurid antecedents possesses a sense of grandeur and an extremely sophisticated realization of geometrical proportion. Timurid architects had developed an understanding of how interconnecting and stacked transverse arches could be used in lieu of solid walls to create new spatial organizations. This resulted in structures with a large central room surrounded by smaller chambers and arched entranceways of various sizes. Such a plan is seen in the Timurid cIshrat Khana, a dynastic mausoleum in Samarqand; it was built for women of the Timurid house and finished around 1464. Frequently imperial Mughal tombs were designed on a similar plan, specifically one consisting of nine bays. That is, a central chamber is surrounded by eight smaller rooms whose placement, size and shape depended on a geometric division of the whole. The Ak-serai tomb in Samarqand was of this type, as were some garden pavilions known from written descriptions. Other Timurid examples of this type include the *khanqah* of Qasim Shaikh in Kirman dated 15 58-59 and the tomb of Uleg Beg Miranshah in Ghazni (d. 1506). Since the architect of Humayun's tomb, the first Timurid-inspired tomb in Mughal India, came from Bukhara, where he had designed a variety of building types, the Timurid inspiration for this and later Mughal tombs is not surprising. In mature phases of Timurid architecture, the surrounding chambers became symbolic of the eight levels of paradise, a concept adopted for Mughal mausolea as well.

The complex geometrical formulae used for Timurid building plans and the arcuated systems of the walls allowed a proportionately large floor space to be covered by a narrower superstructure. New vaulting systems consisting of arch-nets in the squinches were created to cover angles formed by intersecting arches. Stellate forms, frequently based on the structure's geometrical proportions, adorned interior domes and vaults. These are found first in Timurid and then in Mughal architectural vaulting.

Following a long-standing Iranian tradition, the garden, symbolic of paradise, was developed by the Timurids and subsequently by the Mughals. Informally planted walled gardens with running streams, pools and often

## MUGHAL TASTE ANTICIPATED

pavilions were an inherent part of the large Timurid cities. Babur, the first Mughal emperor, lists in his memoirs numerous gardens that delighted him in Timurid Herat, a city whose splendid palaces and gardens went a long way in influencing Babur's own building schemes in India. These gardens were called *char bagh* (literally: four gardens), although their actual layout is open to dispute since none remains today. While some believe that this type of garden was divided into four sections as at the Mughal tombs, others believe that the term derives from the practice of planting in sets of four beds and that quartering a garden by waterways was a Mughal innovation.

The type of Jamic or large congregational mosque developed under the imperial Mughals derives from large Timurid mosques. These are *iour-aiwan* structures in whose center is an open courtyard. The prayer chamber of these mosques is entered through a large vaulted portal. The side wings are pillared corridors. This type of Timurid mosque, for example the Bibi Khanum in Samarqand (i398-1405), or the Kalan mosque (fifteenth-sixteenth century) in Bukhara, adheres closely to earlier Seljuk models that had been the prototype as well for the mosque (Plates 1 and 2) erected by the Ghorid rulers who had conquered Delhi in the late twelfth century. This would explain why early Mughal mosques ideally modeled on Timurid types often appear to resemble in plan many earlier Sultanate mosques of India.

## MUGHAL TASTE ANTICIPATED

The heritage bequeathed to the new Mughal rulers and their subjects was a rich and varied one. It included Iranian, indigenous Indian and eventually even European forms and symbolism. Attitudes toward this heritage during the subsequent 300 years, on both an imperial and a sub-imperial level, will formulate a Mughal aesthetic and create a unique cultural expression.

Mughal architectural taste and idiom evolves from the center outwards. It is triggered by imperial predilection, rarely arbitrary but embedded in political and cultural ideology. The ruler is not often solely responsible for construction outside central urban areas; rather, it is the nobility, usually high-ranking, wealthy and sophisticated, that are responsible for building there. They built, often prolifically, on their landholdings that were granted in lieu of salary, even though these lands were shifted about every two years to prevent the establishment of threatening power bases. Such construction, almost always rooted in a current Mughal idiom but often reflecting local taste as well, was essentially a way to curry favor with the emperor and to buy power and success. In return, the mosques, temples, palaces, gardens and other works erected served as symbols of Mughal presence and authority. Even during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when the capital, Delhi, increasingly became both the heart and perimeter of the Mughal empire, imperial Mughal architectural

aesthetic and taste served as the model for construction in developing splinter states. Mughal style eventually came to represent not Mughal authority, but the cultural and social values established under the Mughals. These values were cherished by Muslim subjects living increasingly under western colonial rule. How, why and where this transpired is the story of the next five chapters.
