#### CHAPTER 7

# ARCHITECTURE AND THE STRUGGLE FOR AUTHORITY UNDER THE LATER MUGHALS AND THEIR SUCCESSOR STATES

#### HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS

Aurangzeb died in 1707, but the Mughal empire endured, at least officially, for another 150 years. It lasted until the British exiled and imprisoned the last Mughal ruler after the uprising in 1858. Shah Alam Bahadur Shah succeeded Aurangzeb in 1707. Continuous political turmoil prevented him, however, from entering the long-standing Mughal capital, Delhi, after his coronation. Delhi again became the imperial residence in 1712, but the empire continued to suffer seriously from financial problems, political intrigue, inadequately prepared rulers, and invasions. Moreover, Delhi experienced difficulties that reflected on the entire state. In 1739 the city was sacked by the Iranian ruler Nadir Shah and again in the 1750s by Afghans who entered India four times. In fact, as Delhi became increasingly vulnerable, it also became virtually all that was left of the Mughal empire. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, two Delhis emerged – the older Mughal city where the king still resided in Shah Jahan's fort, and British Delhi which increasingly encroached upon and transformed the older city.

As the empire weakened, the nawabs of Murshidabad, Awadh and Hyderabad established their own successor states, while Sikh, Jat, Maratha and other Hindu rulers asserted their independence, carving out numerous little kingdoms from what once had been a single empire. The architecture sponsored by the rulers and inhabitants of these new domains is heavily dependent on the Mughal style established under Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb, yet in each case new formal interpretations and meaning are given to older forms. The results are often highly creative expressions, reflecting these houses' political allegiance and religious affiliation.

# PATTERNS OF PATRONAGE

## Delhi: the capital, 1707-1858

#### The city before 1739

For the first half of the eighteenth century Delhi remained the unrivaled center of Muslim culture in north India, although eventually many poets and artists seeking more secure and lucrative patronage went to such stable courts as

Awadh and Murshidabad.<sup>1</sup> While no Mughal ruler so much as entered the city between 1679 and 1712, Delhi's allure remained so great that an order was issued prohibiting those in the army from going there without permission. Literature, music, mystic thought and humanistic learning continued to flourish, although painting and architecture had suffered from a lack of imperial patronage well before Aurangzeb left Delhi. Between Aurangzeb's death and Muhammad Shah's reign (1719-48), little of consequence was constructed in the walled city of Shahjahanabad. In any event, no later Mughal ruler was a prolific provider of buildings. Rather, princes, queens, nobles and, increasingly, otherwise unknown citizens provided structures along with the ruler. Thus the study of architecture here will not be divided into imperial and sub-imperial categories as earlier in this book.

From the time he succeeded Aurangzeb, Shah cAlam Bahadur Shah never entered Delhi. He did, however, commission the construction of a mosque and his own simple screened yet roofless tomb in the *dargab* of Bakhtiyar Kaki, just behind the famous thirteenth-century Qutb Minar. The continued importance of this *dargab* is attested by buildings provided there by some of Bahadur Shah's successors and the fact that the last Mughal resided in a mansion attached to the *dargab.*

Qutb Sahib Bakhtiyar Kaki, a follower of the Chishti order, had been a fourteenth-century saint. His *dargab* was a venerated shrine even before his death, though never as popular as the *dargab* of Shaikh Nizam al-Din, also in Delhi. Before Aurangzeb's reign there is virtually no evidence of Mughal patronage at Dargah Bakhtiyar Kaki, although Babur did visit the shrine. By praying there upon his entry into Delhi in 1526, Babur may have confirmed its sanctity for the Mughals. Commencing with Shah cAlam Bahadur Shah, Dargah Bakhtiyar Kaki enjoyed unprecedented Mughal patronage. The reason for this remains unclear. In general, however, Mughal patronage at shrines in the vicinity of Delhi expanded, because Mughal authority outside Delhi was increasingly challenged.

Both the shrine of Bakhtiyar Kaki and also the emperor benefited from the close association that developed. On one hand the Mughal kings legitimized their rule by this intimate contact with the spiritual heirs of Shaikh Qutb Sahib Bakhtiyar Kaki; in turn, the shrine itself reaped economic and social benefits from imperial patronage. Once the Mughal rulers invested there, so, too, did high-ranking Mughal nobility and, by the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the nawabs of independent or vassal states.<sup>2</sup>

Plate 192. Shah cAlam Bahadur's mosque, known as the Moti mosque, Delhi

shrine of Bakhtiyar Kaki, is known as the Moti mosque. Probably built several years before Bahadur Shah's death in 1712, the marble mosque is situated in a walled enclosure to the west of the saint's grave. Unlike the double-aisled Moti mosque in the Shahjahanabad fort, this is a single-aisled structure. It is surmounted by three bulbous domes on constricted necks. On each corner of the east central bay is a slender engaged baluster-like column, a feature by now used in religious architecture.

Bahadur Shah's successor, Farrukh Siyar (r. 1713-19), further embellished the *dargah* by building a screened marble enclosure around Bakhtiyar Kaki's grave and two marble entrance gates leading to the grave site. He also rebuilt in white marble the *dargah's* original stucco mosque situated to the east of the saint's tomb. The marble gates (Plate 193) are inscribed with inlaid black marble characters, thus drawing upon forms and materials first introduced by Shah Jahan at the Ajmer Chishti shrine (Plate 105). The one closest to the tomb, dated 1717-18, is characterized by rounded cusped arches in whose spandrels are large floral medallions and arabesque creepers. Beyond Farrukh Siyar's gates the devotee goes through a series of passages from the first entrance to the grave. This architectural complexity helps emphasize the saint's importance.<sup>3</sup>

Plate 193. Farrukh Siyar's gate, Dargah Bakhtiyar Kaki, Delhi

Since *dargahs* have inherent authority, the Mughals, as a result of their patronage, draw upon that authority.

Farrukh Siyar's additions radically changed the shrine's appearance. Visually the Chishti *dargah* of Bakhtiyar Kaki now more closely resembled the premier Chishti shrine of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din in Ajmer, where during Shah Jahan's reign many of the major structures had been built by the royal family. But the shrine in Ajmer received no new support from the late Mughals due to unfavorable political conditions. Instead Bakhtiyar Kaki's shrine was revitalized by the later Mughals in white marble and building types that evoked a glorious Mughal past.

Festivities at the shrine also underscored Mughal affiliation with the Chishti order. For example, Raushan al-Daula Zafar Khan, by far the most influential amir in the court of Muhammad Shah, more powerful even than the prime minister *(wazir),* spent vast sums, much of them embezzled, on the cUrs ceremony at Khwaja Qutb Sahib Bakhtiyar Kaki's *dargah.* By providing elaborate lighting devices along the road that led from the palace in Shahjahanabad to the *dargah* some 15 km south, he created a spectacular

visual link between the Mughals and this shrine. These celebrations, popular with Muslims and Hindus alike, appealed to a wide section of the population.

Muhammad Shah assumed the throne in late 1719, reigning twenty-nine years, until his death in 1748. He was the third monarch to rule after Farrukh Siyar; his two predecessors did not survive even a full year. Muhammad Shah is credited with constructing a wall around Dargah Chiraq-i Delhi in 1729 and the construction of a wooden mosque inside the Shahjahanabad palace. He also built his own tomb (Plate 194) inside the shrine of Nizam al-Din in Delhi. This white marble screened tomb is modeled closely on the nearby tomb of Jahan Ara Begum (Plate 167), although this tomb-type long had become standard. Muhammad Shah's enclosure reveals more profuse floral ornamentation and highly carved surfaces, for example along the screen's base.

It is only commencing with Muhammad Shah's reign that considerable building activity is witnessed again within the walled city of Shahjahanabad. Significant construction occurred both before and after the invasion of Delhi by the Iranian Nadir Shah in 1739, suggesting that his attack had less devastating long-term effects than is commonly believed. Among the structures erected before Nadir Shah's invasions is the Sunahri or Golden mosque built in 1721-22 by Raushan al-Daula, who provided lavish celebrations at the cUrs

Plate 195. Partial facade, Raushan al-Daula's mosque, also known as the Sunahn mosque, Chandni Chowk, Delhi

ceremony of Bakhtiyar Kaki. This three-bayed single-aisled mosque is situated next to the Mughal police station (still in use today) in Chandni Chowk, then across from Jahan Ara's great serai. The mosque was provided at the beginning of Raushan al-Daula's rise to power. The location alone, close to the main entrance of the Shahjahanabad palace, indicates his close ties to the emperor. An inscription over the structure's east facade indicates that the mosque was erected to honor Shah Bhik, his spiritual mentor, who had died two years earlier.

Reached by a flight of narrow steps, the structure is elevated above the ground. Its slender minarets that rise above the roof line and the gilt metalplated bulbous domes resting on constricted drums added a delicate air to Shahjahanabad's skyline. The emphasis at this time was on delicacy and refinement, not just on the sense of awesome height that had been a major factor in late seventeenth-century taste (Plates 177 and 179). The mosque's facade (Plate 195) and interior are embellished with molded stucco arabesques and floral motifs. Panels of elaborate floral sprays similar to those on the Badshahi mosque form a dado along the base of the facade. The bases of the fluted engaged pilasters flanking the central bay are elaborately covered with floral tendrils. Thus floral sprays that were earlier reserved for Aurangzeb's palace mosques are now used outside the palace, yet by the highest-ranking nobility.

![](_page_6_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 196. Fakhr al-Masajid, Delhi

The use of hitherto imperial motifs reflects the increasing power assumed by the nobility — at times overshadowing that of the ruler himself.

Although Raushan al-Daula provided more buildings than any other noble during Muhammad Shah's reign, his was not the finest in Delhi. That superb building is the Fakhr al-Masajid, or Pride of the Mosques (Plate 196), provided by a noblewoman. The mosque was built in 1728-29 by Kaniz-i Fatima entitled Fakhr-i Jahan (Pride of the World), to commemorate her deceased husband, Shujac at Khan, a high-ranking noble under Aurangzeb. Situated on a high plinth, not far from Delhi's Kashmir gate, it is one of the few stone mosques built in Delhi during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This red sandstone mosque, faced with white marble, is clearly modeled on the major mosques of the city erected during the reigns of Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb (Plates 124 and 168). Most of those mosques, too, had been provided by the court ladies. Fakhr-i Jahan, by erecting this mosque, continues an earlier tradition. While the emphasis on the mosque's height due to its tall minarets is typical of the period, the delicate inlay and carved niches of its interior recall the uncluttered aesthetic of Shah Jahan's earlier religious architecture.

Other notable mosques of Muhammad Shah's reign built inside the city before Nadir Shah's invasion show the continued vitality of the evolving Mughal style, one that persisted even in the absence of strong central leadership. These include the mosque and school of Nawab Sharaf al-Daula dated

![](_page_7_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 197. Muhtasib's mosque, Delhi

1722-23 and the Muhtasib's mosque (Plate 197) provided in 1723-24 by Abu Sac id, the hereditary inquisitor *(muhtasib)* of Delhi. Both of these are singleaisled three-bayed mosques entered through openings with cusped arches and surmounted by bulbous ribbed domes. These domes recall those on the Moti mosque at Bakhtiyar Kaki's *dargah* (Plate 192) and are similar to many during this period. Nawab Sharaf al-Daulat's mosque is situated on a high plinth with chambers beneath, today shops, that may have served as the school. The mosque of Abu Sac id rather unusually for this time is not atop a high plinth. Unlike Sharaf al-Daula's solid appearing edifice, it bears delicate stucco ornament similar to that on Raushan al-Daula's mosque built only two years earlier.

Not all mosques inside the city were adequately large to serve an entire locality; rather, they were built for personal use. One such example is the mosque of Tahawwur Khan (Plate 198), dated 1727-28, built by a major landholder of Delhi. The area of the city in which this simple single-aisled flatroofed mosque is located is named for Tahawwur Khan and was the site of his mansion. On its facade three cusped entrances are supported by bulbous pilaster columns. Thus a variety of mosques was erected before 1739; possibly the lack of a strong imperial pattern accounts for this diversity in form and ornament.

Religious structures appear to dominate the later Mughal architecture of

![](_page_8_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 198. Mosque of Tahawwur Khan, Delhi

Delhi. That is because mostly sacred buildings remain, although serais, gardens and markets continued to be built. The surviving ones are outside the city wall. For example, an extensive bazaar known today as the Tripolia with a massive triple-arched entrance gate at either end was built in 1728-29 north of the walled city along the major highway leading to Lahore. This compound was built by Nazir Mahaldar Khan, superintendent of the women's quarter in the palace of Muhammad Shah.

At Muhammad Shah's request, the raja of Jaipur, Sawai Jai Singh Kachhwaha (1699-1743), provided Delhi with an extraordinary observatory known as the Jantar Mantar (Plate 199). This able statesman and astrologer constructed the observatory about 1725 in an area to the south of the walled city known as Jaisinghpura, probably the locale of his own estate there. Subsequently he built similar observatories with comparable sophisticated structural instruments in Jaipur, Benares, Mathura and Ujjain. Constructed of brick and plaster, the juxtaposed circular and angular shapes of these enormous instruments produce an effect unlike that of any other architecture of the period. Their forms as well as their scientific sophistication remain appealing to twentieth-century sensibilities. Muhammad Shah's desire for such an observatory speaks highly of his interest in promoting scientific knowledge, not simply the literary arts for which he is well known.

#### *Delhi: 1739-1858*

In 1739, the Iranian ruler Nadir Shah invaded Delhi. This was the city's first invasion in almost two centuries. From Raushan al-Daula's Sunahri mosque, Nadir Shah ordered the city plundered - a sack that lasted less than twelve hours. Many were killed, regardless of religion. The markets and buildings in the vicinity of Chandni Chowk as well as the fort suffered great damage. The psychological jolt given to the complacent citizens of Delhi was never fully forgotten. Poets many years later continued to lament this event as if it had happened yesterday. The Iranian ruler remained in the city for about two months, taking on his departure the money from the royal treasury, jewels including Shah Jahan's Peacock Throne and the Koh-i Nur diamond - and many other valuables. However, the loss of this wealth, essentially noncirculating, ultimately had little impact on the city's economy since trade continued to prosper.<sup>4</sup>

Indeed, Delhi recovered quickly, and new buildings replaced those destroyed. The very patron who had provided the mosque from which Nadir Shah issued his order for the destruction gave the city a second mosque. Raushan al-Daula Zafar Khan provided it in 1744-45.5 By now the former

*<sup>\*</sup>* S. Chandra, "Cultural and Political Role of Delhi," p. 206. <sup>5</sup>

Textual sources indicate Raushan al-Daula died in 1736; however, this mosque's inscription in the *List,* 1: 32-34, indicates he lived at least another eight years.

Plate 200. Raushan al-Daula's mosque, known today as the Sunahri mosque, Darayaganj, Delhi

influential amir had fallen from favor and was no longer active in politics. His second mosque, like his first one (Plate 195), is known today as the Sunahri or Golden mosque, and, like it, was also built in honor of the religious figure Shah Bhik, who had died some years earlier. Situated south of the fort along the main road that led to the Delhi gate, now an area known as Daryaganj, it is a singleaisled three-bayed mosque (Plate 200). Originally it was surmounted with gilt, copper-faced domes. However, the metal was subsequently removed and placed on the mosque Raushan al-Daula had constructed earlier in Chandni Chowk. Today even the domes are missing.

This mosque is more robust in appearance than the one he provided some twenty years earlier. It also bears considerably less stucco ornament. Whether this change in aesthetic was conscious is unclear, but the solid yet austere appearance suggests an infusion of new stability into the city.

In 1748 Muhammad Shah was succeeded by his son, Ahmad Shah. The new ruler's mother, Udham Bai, also known as Qudsiya Begum, wielded considerable influence over Ahmad Shah, as she had done in the early stages of Muhammad Shah's reign when she was that ruler's favorite consort. Now, in fact, this shrewd queen and her confidant, Javid Khan, the prime minister, held the true reins of power. Qudsiya Begum was an enthusiastic provider of architecture, best known for her palace and garden complex, Qudsiya Bagh. It

![](_page_11_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 201. Qudsiya Bagh mosque, Delhi

was probably commenced when Ahmad Shah assumed the throne in 1748. Located just north of Delhi's walled city, this garden housed a substantial residence that overlooked the river Jumna. The mansion has since been destroyed, but late eighteenth-century engravings of its riverside facade indicate its splendor and size. A large two-storied edifice, the mansion had polygonal turrets at each end. The facade was marked with projecting oriel windows surmounted with sloped *bangala-type* roofs, indicating that this roof type continued to be used on secular architecture. Today only an entrance gate and mosque remain, both made of stucco-covered brick.

The massive gate, probably that of the entire compound, is surmounted by unusually large *kungura.* Detailed ornamentation of the gate's stucco work contributes to an overall elaborate appearance. Beyond is the mosque (Plate 201), whose plan is similar to that of others in the later Mughal period. It is richly adorned with molded and polychromed stucco, marked by elaborate faceted patterns and exaggerated floral designs found at the base and apex of arches. Engaged pilasters are flattened and highly articulated with chevron-like designs. Such ornamentation is usually termed decadent, as if to reflect Qudsiya Begum's own character, generally considered low and unrefined. She was, however, a highly cultured woman. In any event, this ornamentation is

3°3

![](_page_12_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 202. Mosque of Qudsiya Begum and Javid Khan, known as the Sunahri mosque, Delhi

simply a more exuberant expression of that developed under the earlier Mughals.

During her son's short reign, Qudsiya Begum provided a second mosque (Plate 202), with Javid Khan, in 1750—51. Like the two mosques provided by Raushan al-Daula, this one, too, is known as the Sunahri mosque after its once metal-plated domes. Located along the main road just south of the palace, the compound is entered by a red carved stone gate. The red stone mosque is small and delicate, though flanked on either side by extremely tall minarets. These and the bulbous domes emphasize the mosque's height, giving the small building a grandiose air. It is decorated with more subdued ornament than that of Qudsiya Begum's private mosque on her mansion grounds.

In the year the queen mother provided the Sunahri mosque she also built several structures at a Shia shrine known as Shahi Mardan in Delhi, about 9 km south of the walled city. These included an assembly hall, a mosque and tank as well as a walled enclosure. Little is known about the shrine before Qudsiya Begum's patronage there, but it is probable that the queen mother erected these structures to augment a Qadam Sharif, a building housing a footprint revered as that of cAh, who according to the Shia sect was the rightful

![](_page_13_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 203. Qudsiya Begum's Shahi Mardan mosque, Delhi

successor of Muhammad. The current Qadam Sharif was built in 1759-60, probably renewing an older one. Although most of Qudsiya Begum's buildings here have been rebuilt, her mosque (Plate 203) remains a well-preserved example of eighteenth-century religious architecture. It closely resembles the overall plan and elevation of her private Qudsiya Bagh mosque. Lacking is the profuse stucco ornament, suggesting that more austere decor was considered appropriate for public buildings such as the Sunahri mosque, built concurrently. Qudsiya Begum's patronage here may have been an attempt to give this Shia shrine similar status to that enjoyed by Sunni shrines of Bakhtiyar Kaki and Nizam al-Din.

By the mid-eighteenth century Delhi was virtually all that remained of the once great Mughal empire. Nevertheless, that small empire and its emperor remained the model for Muslim culture and administration throughout north India. In Bengal and elsewhere, former provinces were transformed into autonomous states. In the case of Awadh, however, the ties with Delhi were broken gradually. For example, Safdar Jang, the Mughal governor of Awadh, never regarded himself as independent, but part of the larger empire. After his death in 1754 his body was transported a considerable distance to the imperial capital, Delhi, which Safdar Jang always considered his home. There his son, Nawab Shujac al-Daula, built an enormous mausoleum (Plate 204).

3°5

![](_page_14_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 204. Safdar Jang's tomb, Delhi

Not only was Safdar Jang's tomb built in the Mughal capital, it was, moreover, closely modeled on Humayun's tomb, the first imperial Mughal mausoleum (Plates 18 and 19). This square plan tomb is in the center of a walled *char bagh* complex. Although the tomb's layout, plan and its exterior, faced with pink and white stone, recall Humayun's tomb, Safdar Jang's tomb bears many features characteristic of mid-eighteenth-century architecture. These include complex stucco ornament on the interior, cusped rounded entrance arches, central *pishtaqs* surmounted by a series of bulbous domes and a central dome that rests on a tightly constricted drum. The structure presents a balance between increased surface articulation and mass. Commonly referred to as the last vestige of an older Mughal architectural style, this tomb exerted considerable influence on the mausolea of the subsequent nawabs of Awadh and their queens, who were buried in either Faizabad or Lucknow (Plate 216). This older imperial-type tomb appealed to the ruler of Awadh, the tomb's patron, who had adopted with minimal change many of the customs and regulations of the Mughal court.

Although the Mughal empire became increasingly impotent politically, Delhi continued to flourish even into the late eighteenth century. Much of Delhi's construction at this time was financed by persons employed by the East

Plate 205. Lai Bangala tomb, Delhi

India Company or by businessmen. Into the nineteenth century, the growth of wealthy Jain, Jat and other non-Muslim communities increased. In what was once the heartland of the Mughal empire, these non-Muslims constructed their own buildings that reflected Delhi's new elite. For example, almost directly in front of the Shahjahanabad fort several Jain and Hindu temples were built, and elsewhere in the walled city Hindu temples were erected in prolific numbers.

The Mughal emperors and their subjects continued to build, although not as extensively as before. Some mosques were added inside the walled city, among them one provided in 1779 by Qasim Khan, a high-ranking noble in the reign of Shah cAlam II. But increasingly construction occurred south of the walled city, in part because the esteemed Chishti *dargahs* were there. In 1755-56 the emperor cAlamgir II himself wrote an inscription now inside the tomb of Nizam al-Din indicating that he had made repairs and additions to the shrine. South of the city, moreover, there was vacant land suitable for the construction of garden complexes and tombs. Here, about 1730, Shah cAlam II buried his mother and daughter in a walled enclosure that contains three red stone tombs (Plate 205). Each of the single-story buildings is surmounted with a bulbous ribbed dome standing on a constricted neck. Internally they are arranged with eight smaller chambers surrounding a large central one, a plan common in Mughal tombs and dwellings (Plate 74). Known as Lai Bangala or the Red Pavilion on account of their color, they are today within the compound of the

Delhi Golf Club. They are rare examples at this time of domed mausolea for imperial family members.

In 1803, the British gained control of Delhi, and Mughal authority existed in name alone. The Mughal emperors, however, assumed their regal responsibilities as best they could, for they remained symbols of a way of life and refined culture whose significance even the British recognized. They continued to construct religious and palace edifices when possible. In 1811 new stone masonry bridges replacing older wooden drawbridges were placed before the Lahore and Delhi gates of the Shahjahanabad palace.6 Erected under the auspices of the Mughal ruler Akbar II, their construction was supervised by an Englishman, Robert Macpherson. These immovable bridges served British interests, for their presence meant that the fort could not be completely isolated by Mughal inhabitants.

An increasing number of religious buildings was provided by citizens identified only by name. For example, in 1837-38 Saddho, a woman who describes herself as a humble milkmaid, erected religious structures within the old city that no longer remain. Still standing, however, is a red sandstone

Plate 207. Mosque of Hamid cAli Khan, Delhi

mosque (Plate 206) built in 1822-23 by Mubarak Begum, known as Lai Kunwar, the consort of an Englishman residing in Delhi. This small singleaisled three-bayed mosque is probably the best surviving example of early nineteenth-century Mughal architecture in Delhi today. Its facade is marked by rounded cusped arches, above which is a tri-lobed arch whose central bay recalls the baldachin covering on Shah Jahan's throne in his nearby Public Audience Hall (Plate 119). The interior transverse arches are tri-lobed, the shape of decorative arches on the mosque's exterior. Tri-lobed arches also appear on the mihrab. The mosque's interior is finely but chastely carved with shallow recessed arches and cusped niches. This small but well-balanced structure suggests a waning taste for highly ornate surfaces in Delhi, while in contemporary Lucknow and Murshidabad, Mughal successor states, the desire for ornate surfaces was at a peak.

The last significant Mughal building erected within the old walled city is the mosque of Hamid cAli Khan (Plate 207), the prime minister of Bahadur Shah II (1837-58), the last Mughal emperor. Hamid cAli built it in 1841-42 not far from the Kashmir gate. Its inscription was written by Ghalib, the most famous poet of the time. This large mosque, situated on a raised platform, reveals a sense of spatial tension. Here the emphasis is on the horizontal, while spatial tension in the later seventeenth century had a vertical emphasis. Yet the sense of visual

imbalance is similar. The facade bears three large cusped entrance arches. The central bay, marked with a large arch whose central lobe forms a curved cornice, recalls Shah Jahan's throne in the nearby fort. Its flanking side-wings are surmounted with a parapet of miniature domes based on earlier Mughal entrance gates, in particular the entrance into the Taj Mahal. The mosque's interior (Plate 208) features cusped arches supported on baluster-type columns derived from those first used in Shah Jahan's architecture.

This evocation of forms from the past was intentional, for Hamid cAli chose not to include any of the increasingly apparent westernized features on his mosque; instead he looked back to motifs manifest most clearly during the height of Mughal power. In this same manner, Bahadur Shah only a decade later commissioned the poet Ghalib, the very poet who wrote the verse embellishing Hamid cAli's mosque, to write a history of the entire Mughal house commencing with Timur. The vision of the last Mughal and those associated with him was to the past, not to any future. Ghalib himself laments the passing of the past, a major theme in his verse and letters, evoking Shah Jahan's reign as a golden age.<sup>7</sup> Yet, while Hamid cAli's mosque shows features based on those of earlier Mughal buildings, they are here combined in a unique manner. This innovative structure suggests that even at the very end of the Mughal period architectural forms and decor maintained a deep debt to the aesthetic of Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb; yet at the same time these forms continued to evolve in a highly experimental and creative manner.

The last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah II, a sufi himself, constructed his own red sandstone mansion adjacent to the *dargah* of Bakhtiyar Kaki. It was known as Zafar Mahal after the king's poetic name. It is no accident that the residence was constructed close to the *dargah.* Just as tombs were built in the compounds of these shrines so that the interred might receive the divine power *(baraka)* of the saint, so the last Mughal, with little authority of his own, hoped to derive some from the inherent authority of the *dargah.*

For generations the Mughals had patronized the *dargah* of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din Chishti in Ajmer, but due to political difficulties did so no longer by the beginning of the eighteenth century. Not much later the Mughals lost Ajmer to Hindu authorities, who held it until 1818, when the British took control. All the same, the importance of Ajmer's Chishti shrines attracted support from Hindus and Muslims alike. Moreover, Mughal authority, while in reality

Plate 208. Interior column, Hamid cAli Khan's mosque

impotent in Ajmer, remained symbolically important. For example, in fulfillment of a vow made during an illness, cAli Jah, the nawab of Karnataka, constructed a white marble pavilion (Plate 209) at the *dargah* of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din in 1793. The flat-roofed rectangular pavilion is largely modeled on Shah Jahan's Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque in the *dargah* (Plate 105), including even details such as the inscription inlaid in black marble lettering. The inscription evokes the Mughal emperor's name, even though he had no political authority in Ajmer, reflecting his continuing role as a figure-head of Indian Persianate culture.

Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din inspired patronage even outside the *dargah.* A large cIdgah (Plate 210) was constructed some distance from the shrine to honor the saint according to the inscription embedded in its qibla wall. Only on the city outskirts was there adequate open space for this large structure. It was provided in 1773-74 by Nawab Mirza Chaman Beg, the governor of Malwa under the Sindhia rajas, then the masters of Ajmer. An impressive interpretation of a *bangala-msp'ireA* roof forms the upper portion of this vast wall mosque's upper central bay. Beneath this curved form is a pavilion depicted in stucco relief that resembles Shah Jahan's balcony from which he presented himself to the public (Plate 113). Subsequent variations on this pavilion type were used frequently in

the palace architecture of the Rajasthani princes, but in all cases this paviliontype maintained a royal or religious connotation. Its use here serves as a reference to Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din, who in the cIdgah's inscription is called "king of the dominion."<sup>8</sup>

Tombs built earlier in Ajmer continued to be embellished. cAbd Allah Khan, father of the king-maker Sayyid brothers who were so very prominent during the first half of the eighteenth century, had built a garden, mosque and tomb for his wife in Ajmer at the end of Aurangzeb's reign. cAbd Allah Khan's own tomb (Plate 211) was added to this garden complex in 1710 by his son, Sayyid Husain cAli Khan. Five years later, in 1715, he added a large arched entrance to the compound. The tomb is loosely modeled in plan and elevation on the Aurangzeb-period Sola Khamba, or tomb of Shaikh cAla al-Din, just outside the *dargah* of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din Chishti (Plate 169). A dome and four corner *chattris,* however, surmount the roof of cAbd Allah Khan's tomb, while the roof of the earlier tomb is flat. On cAbd Allah's tomb, the cusping of the arches is tighter, less exaggerated, and the supporting pillars are less ornate. While architecture under the later Mughals is generally considered a more exaggerated version of earlier Mughal material, here is one of several instances where the opposite pertains.

Plate 210. cIdgah, Ajmer

Construction in the city continued as well, the most notable example being the mosque of Mir Sac adat cAli, today across from the railway station. This two-storied mosque, dated 1852-53, when Ajmer was part of the Britishgoverned Rajputana Agency, is built in an eighteenth-century Mughal idiom with cusped arches and delicate stucco work. Its inscription, like that on its more experimental counterpart in Delhi, is also composed by the famous poet Ghalib.

While most cities grew randomly within and outside their confines, Jaipur, founded in 1727, was completely planned. Sawai Jai Singh (1688-1743), a remarkable statesman and head of the Kachhwaha house, built it on the plain below Amber, this house's older capital. The layout of his new capital was praised widely in contemporary sources. Based on ancient Hindu texts, the resulting walled city, with broad regular streets dividing it into quadrants in a grid-like pattern, is far more organized than the Mughal city of Shahjahanabad. Sawai Jai Singh's interest in astronomy as indicated by his observatories also had an imprint on the city's plan.

The focal point of the city is the palace. It is designed along the lines of a traditional Rajasthan mansion, but different from the residential part of Mughal palaces. Chambers for residential, administrative and courtly functions are all contained within these multi-storied walls. Even more graceful than

![](_page_22_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 211. cAbd Allah Khan's tomb, Ajmer

Mughal palaces, this one has a light appearance. This is achieved through the use of numerous cusped arches on slender columns, screens containing very delicate carving, and many pillared pavilions with curved roofs surmounting the roofline. These features emphasize the sense of height and also create a graceful skyline.

Much of the city and its uniformly designed buildings were constructed under Sawai Jai Singh, but his successors continued to build there as well. In 1799 Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh built the Hawa Mahal (Plate 212). This residential building, constructed to take advantage of the cooling breezes, was dedicated to the Hindu deity Krishna and his consort, Radha. Its six stories of clustered, articulated and projecting oriel windows, all surmounted by curved roofs, resemble a honeycomb. The building's top floor reflects each of the smaller roofs. This in essence utilizes traditional Indian building concepts of reduplication of forms, yet maintains the characteristic late eighteenth-century height, grace and lightness.

#### *North India*

#### *Lahore to Agra*

The Mughals were able to hold Lahore and most of the Punjab until the mideighteenth century, when political instability made their rule there tenuous. By 1768, Sikh chiefs had replaced the Mughals until the British, in turn, superseded

![](_page_23_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 212. Hawa Mahal, Jaipur

them in 1849. Few notable monuments were erected in the Punjab during the later Mughal period, possibly reflecting the unstable conditions as well as the lack of imperial intervention there. The tomb of Sharaf al-Nisa Begum, known as the Sarvwala Maqbara, or Cypress tomb, after its dominant ornamentation, is Lahore's best-preserved monument from the post-Aurangzeb period. Sharaf al-Nisa was the sister of Nawab Zakariya Khan, a governor of Lahore under Muhammad Shah. This tomb purportedly was used during her life as a meditation chamber. A unique structure, the building is a tapering tower surmounted with a pyramidal vault. Cypress trees and floral motifs rendered in glazed tile mosaic embellish the upper portion. Glazed tile is not new in Lahore, but the stiff, rigid quality of the design is a marked departure from the free-flowing arabesques of earlier periods.

Under the Sikhs building accelerated considerably. Many new buildings, often faced with marble stripped from older Mughal structures, were erected by the new government and leading Sikh citizens. The styles of these Sikh buildings in Lahore correspond with those found elsewhere in contemporary north India. That is, cusped arches, fluted domes, slender carved columns and curved cornice roofs dominate. For example, the Baradari (Plate 213) in the garden facing Lahore's Badshahi mosque is a delicate marble edifice whose columns and cusped arches belong to the Mughal tradition. This is a squareplan pavilion constructed in 1818 by Ranjit Singh.

The most important Sikh monument is not in Lahore but in Amritsar. This is the Golden temple, commenced in the late eighteenth century and completed largely during the nineteenth century. Situated in the middle of an enormous tank connected to land via a long causeway, the shrine is known as the Harimandir. This two-storied structure is entirely gilt-covered, glistening in the sun and giving the impression of extraordinary opulence. The temple's square plan and two-storied elevation surmounted by a small domed pavilion and *chattris* appear to derive from Mughal tomb-types as well as some palaces, for example, the one at Datia (Plate 99). However, the result is characteristic of Sikh shrines alone. Other features, however, such as the fluted domes, curved cornices and multiple small domes that surmount the shrine's parapet are pan-Indian devices of this period that transcend sectarian lines.

The Mughals lost control of Agra and its surrounding area to the Jats early in the eighteenth century. Here the older established Muslim families suffered more than those of Delhi as they were replaced by Jat and Maratha Hindu elites.<sup>9</sup> However, many Muslim artisans still found patronage since the products they originally produced were now demanded by the new Hindu elite, insuring a continuity of style. Little Muslim construction was witnessed

Plate 213. Baradari, Lahore fort

in this area during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but temples, palaces and gardens constructed under Hindu patrons now embellished the Agra region. This area flourished under these new rulers while they constructed their headquarters at Dig, Bharatpur and other localities. The area's association with the birthplace and childhood of Krishna further stimulated its vigorous revitalization. For example, members of the Jaipur royal family are credited with providing a number of temples in Brindavan, while the subsequent Jat rulers of the area also maintained these structures and added their own as well. Nearby at Govardhan multi-storied cenotaphs embellished with cusped arches, *bangala-rooied* pavilions and ribbed domes were built to memorialize the rajas of Bharatpur.

But by far the most impressive work is the palace at Dig in Bharatpur District (Plate 214). It was constructed as the new Jat headquarters under Badan Singh (1722-56) and his family, most notably Suraj Mai (1756—63) and his successors. Although built in several stages and under different patrons, the palace and its garden setting adhere to a symmetrical formality derived from Mughal gardens. A central square *char bagh* is surmounted on all four sides by pavilions, recalling the organization of Mughal gardens. Massive tanks on the north and south ends of the palace complex, however, recall Hindu temples more than any Mughal palace. The palace pavilions are characterized by an air

of solidity and grace. Badan Singh's portion of the palace, known as the Purana Mahal, consists of a series of rectangular pavilions surmounted by deeply sloped curved roofs topped with spiked finials, creating a highly articulated yet elegant skyline. Another portion of the Dig palace is the Keshav Bhavan, overlooking one of the large tanks. It is a single-storied open building with baluster-like columns supporting cusped arches on each facade. Short and somewhat squat, these fluted columns rise from bases out of which emerge large lotus petals. Not simply a mirror of structures executed at the nearcontemporary city of Jaipur, the buildings of Dig appear more substantial, with less emphasis on height. Their reflections mirrored in the nearby tanks, however, lend them an illusionistic quality. Mechanical devices to emulate rain and thunder were incorporated into Dig's architecture. The purpose was to evoke the yearning of lovers, a Hindu theme stimulated by painting and poetry.

Structures at nearby Mathura, built in the nineteenth century during the period of British supremacy there, are of a style similar to contemporary material in Delhi and Rajasthan. Among these is a cenotaph built as a memorial to a deceased Hindu, Parikhji, who died in 1837. In plan it is similar to the octagonal tomb-type of the Lodi and Sur kings. The ornamentation, however, is typical of nineteenth-century architecture here and in Delhi. Cenotaphs such as this were originally associated only with Muslim custom. Then, around the sixteenth century, they were erected by some of the Hindu princely families of Rajasthan to commemorate their ancestors. This cenotaph at Mathura has been adapted to non-royal Hindu use, blurring the distinction in architecture reserved for one religion or another as well as that reserved for the monarch on the one hand and his subjects on the other.

#### *Faizabad and Lucknow: architecture under the nawabs of Awadh*

The Mughal governors of Awadh became increasingly independent so that soon after the time of Safdar Jang (d. 1754) ties with central authority remained in name only. The governors administered Awadh from Lucknow, the Mughal headquarters, which soon became the premier city of Awadh. However, Faizabad, some 120 km to the northeast, was the initial residence of Safdar Jang and his immediate successors, the nawabs as they were called, in recognition of their original role as deputies to the Mughal emperor. During the reign of Safdar Jang's successor, Shujac al-Daula (1754-75), Faizabad became such a significant city that contemporary chronicles, probably exaggerated ones, claim that it equaled Shahjahanabad in beauty and magnificence. Most of the city has long since disappeared, but a mosque and the tombs constructed for Shujac al-Daula and his wife remain notable reminders of Faizabad's early splendor.

During the initial period of the nawabs' power, buildings were modeled closely on Mughal prototypes, for Delhi, still the center of courtly Muslim

![](_page_27_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 214. Palace, Dig, Bharatpur District

culture, remained the ideal to emulate. This is evident in buildings of the central market place *{chowk),* commenced about 1765 by Shujac al-Daula. He provided this *chowk* with an elaborate triple-arched entrance. In the market, Hasan Reza Khan, later to be one of the chief ministers of Awadh, built a mosque, known today as the Chowk mosque (Plate 215). The three bulbous domes and two minarets of this single-aisled three-bayed mosque, situated on a high plinth, dominate the skyline. This emphasis on the building's height recalls Mughal buildings of Aurangzeb's reign (Plate 179). Other aspects, however, relate to more contemporary architecture of Delhi, for example the stucco work above the cusped arches and the ornate treatment of the mosque's parapet (Plates 201 and 204).

Tombs in Faizabad also were inspired by Mughal models; particularly the tomb for Shujac al-Daula, built about 1775, and one for his wife, Bahu Begum (Plate 216), constructed about forty years later, after her death in 1816, show Mughal features. Both of these tombs, like the tomb of Safdar Jang (Plate 204), Shujac al-Daula's predecessor, have bulbous domes and are set in *char haghs.* The ornament on these tombs, like that on the Chowk mosque, is deeply rooted in earlier Mughal traditions. At the same time, these tombs reveal original characteristics such as multiple entrances on the facade and elaborate parapets on the roof, significant features in the developing independent Awadhi style.

![](_page_28_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 215. Hasan Reza Khan's mosque, known today as the Chowk mosque, Faizabad

Asaf al-Daula, Shujac al-Daula's son and successor, moved his residence to Lucknow, in part to distance himself from the powerful Bahu Begum. From the time of Asaf al-Daula onwards, that is from 1775 to the abolition of the house of Awadh by the British in 1856, Lucknow remained the seat of the nawabs. Although construction was considerable under the nawabs of Awadh, architecture in Lucknow can be placed generally in two broad categories. Those structures built by the nawabs commencing about the later eighteenth century for their own residences or as public works often reflect considerable European influence, while religious structures are usually based on the architecture of earlier Indo-Islamic houses.

Apart from bridges, whose parts were actually ordered from Europe and then assembled in Lucknow, it is the palace architecture that bears the most noticeable European characteristics. Such features as Paladian-style columns, triangular pediments, and Adam-style fanlights were all widely used in Lucknow's residential architecture. Even structures such as a zenana, whose purpose precluded numerous tall windows on the facade as favored by contemporary Europeans, reflect an awareness of European styles. Instead of windows, the architects provided niches with statues or fresco paintings of

![](_page_29_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 216. Bahu Begum's tomb, Faizabad

Plate 217. Gate, Kaiser Bagh in 1858, Lucknow

men.<sup>10</sup> Such ornamentation, however, was only a superficial adaptation of European tradition, for the buildings' interiors continued to follow traditional plans essential to indigenous modes of living. The European features suggest the nawabs' superficial display of regard for the British, yet at the same time an uneasiness with both British dominance and British artistic styles.

A series of palaces was constructed in Lucknow, from Asaf al-Daula's defensively viable Macchi Bhavan, built about 1774, to the Kaiser Bagh, built about 1848 by the last king of Awadh, Wajid cAli Shah. Today only isolated structures that once were part of the extravagant palatial Kaiser Bagh complex remain (Plate 217). Highly influenced by European art, the fine ornate stucco work in the shape of fish (the nawabs' royal emblem), and the floral motifs standing out along exaggerated cusped arches, are characteristic of the Kaiser Bagh buildings. While the well-fortified Macchi Bhavan was a symbol of the nawabs' power, the pleasure-garden nature of the last palace, the Kaiser Bagh,

![](_page_31_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 218. Rumi Darwaza, Lucknow

reflected the impotent nature of the politically moribund nawabs.<sup>11</sup> Thus the increasingly extravagant nature of each subsequent palace, culminating in the Kaiser Bagh, must be seen as reflecting a developing need to project an image of strength. The Europeanized mansions in each palace complex perhaps reflected an image of political power, one often more inflated than real.

The nawabs and their architects seem to have felt greater ease in constructing religious structures, even though they were often part of the palace grounds. In 1784 Nawab Asaf al-Daula commenced an enormous Imambara, a hall used during the Shia celebrations of Muharram and for storing movable shrines (tacziya) used in these ceremonies. This complex adjoined the Macchi Bhavan palace. It was erected to provide work and income for citizens who were suffering from a serious famine. The nawab himself participated in the construction process as an act of religious merit, thereby encouraging even the high-born to labor.<sup>12</sup> The compound consisted of the huge Imambara, a large free-standing mosque, a step-well and elaborate entrance gates. Even in these gates the complex's vast scale is emphasized. Nowhere is this better expressed than in the Rumi Darwaza (Plate 218), the gate serving as the west entrance to the Imambara. This enormous gate's high rounded *pishtaq* is enveloped by a

Llewellyn-Jones, A Fatal Friendship, pp. 177-78.

series of projecting green glazed ceramic finials from which water once spouted. Typical of the Awadh nawabs' architecture, the gate was highly creative, characterized by a sense of dynamic articulation never expressed in the more orderly structures of the Mughals.

The Imambara was at the time of its construction a technological achievement, for it had the largest vaulted hall that ever spanned an uninterrupted space. Yet other aspects of Asaf al-Daula's Imambara belong to a vocabulary of standard ornament found on mosques and madrasas throughout north India. For example, it is adorned with magnificently rendered high stucco relief, numerous arches edged with deep cusping and crowned by a parapet of bulbous domes. While these features, seen on many of Lucknow's religious buildings, are arranged in a manner unique to Awadhi architecture, they are all established forms used earlier on Mughal and other Islamic buildings. Thus in the architecture of Lucknow, just as in the other well-established Muslim house of north India, Murshidabad, long-standing Islamic forms served as the basis of religious structures, while European sources stood behind administrative and residential structures. European forms were meticulously avoided for religious architecture. Rather, the models for religious buildings were structures that had been erected by earlier Indo-Islamic houses. These models were, however, associated not with a dynasty but with the very essence of Islam.

#### *Benares*

Mughal rulers held Benares until the mid-eighteenth century, when the city and the region around it fell to Hindu zamindars who had been awarded the title raja by the Mughal emperor. The new ruler's authority, however, was less than absolute, for the territory held by the Benares raja was under the larger umbrella of the East India Company. Construction in Benares by Muslims diminished during this period. Although mosques continued to be built, the most noteworthy Islamic structure is the tomb of Lac l Khan (Plate 219), dated 1768-69. It overlooks the Ganges at the site where today the Mughal Serai bridge spans the river. The form of this square-plan tomb surmounted by a dome and four *chattris* is highly conservative, adhering closely to Mughalperiod monuments. Glazed-tile decoration on the tomb's surface produces a striking polychrome effect. While glazed-tile embellishment is not generally associated with Mughal and post-Mughal architecture in eastern India, it is also used in a mosque almost precisely contemporary in date, the one built by Mir Ashraf, dated 1773, m Patna. There, however, the tiles are on the floor.

In Benares, the most sacred of all Hindu cities, temples were erected in prolific numbers during the late Mughal period and the years of rule by zamindars. Most important of these was the Vishvanath temple, whose predecessor had been razed by Aurangzeb. A small structure, with delicate reduplicated spires that emphasize the temple's height, it was once again

Plate 219. Tomb of Lac l Khan, Benares

revitalized as the major site of pilgrimage in the holy city. In addition to temples, the ghats, often leading from massive edifices facing the waterfront, were built by Hindu rajas, some residing at a considerable distance, as a means of establishing their own standing in this sacred city.

#### *Eastern India*

#### *Bihar*

The finest late Mughal mausolea in Bihar are modeled on the tombs of Iftikhar Khan in Chunar and Shah Daulat in Maner, each built during Jahangir's reign (Plates 89-92). Among these are tombs built for Shamsher Khan (Plate 220) and Ibrahim Husain Khan, both following the plan and elevation of the tombs from Jahangir's time but embellished with motifs characteristic of eighteenthcentury ornament. That is, each tomb has a domed central chamber surrounded by an open veranda. Ibrahim Husain Khan's tomb in Bhagalpur bears no date, but its interior and exterior walls, ornately articulated with stucco ornament, reflect the increased surface elaboration seen in much eighteenth-century architecture across north India. Also showing the new motifs is Shamsher Khan's

![](_page_34_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 220. Tomb of Shamsher Khan, Shamshernagar

tomb. Among these new features is the dome's high drum with screens that are surmounted by *bangala* roofs. Shamsher Khan served for some time as governor of Patna (then known as cAzimabad) during the reign of Shah cAlam Bahadur Shah. He, like his uncle, Da<sup>c</sup> ud Khan, founded a town in his own name, Shamshernagar, not far from Daudnagar. There he built his own tomb, a serai and well before his death in 1712. Only the tomb remains.

In contrast to the fine late Mughal mausolea of Bihar is the austere Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque of Silao in Nalanda District. This single-aisled three-bayed mosque, constructed in 1741-42 by a father and son, Sayyid Muhammad and Sayyid Ghulam Najaf, is enclosed by high walls, not common in eastern India at this time. On each of the exterior walls are inscriptions, again unusual. Like the exterior, the mosque's interior is sparsely ornamented. Cusped mihrabs and a more complex form of pendentives than seen before in Bihar are the sole decorative devices. The contrast with such contemporary monuments as Ibrahim Husain Khan's tomb in Bhagalpur indicates that in eighteenth-century Bihar no single ornamental style prevailed, probably because there was no single strong patron or model.

Patna remained Bihar's leading commercial center. The city was even enlarged under Prince cAzim al-Shan, governor of Bihar in the early eighteenth century. He renamed the city cAzimabad, proclaiming his desire to create a

second Delhi. His efforts failed, as did his bid for the throne, but Patna still continued to benefit from the patronage of political figures and wealthy merchants. Among the structures they provided, the most elegant is the mosque of Mir Ashraf (Plate 221), constructed by a Patna businessman in 1773-74. Its articulated facade with petal-like *kungura,* cartouches and arched niches is characteristic of those seen throughout India in the eighteenth century. The interior, too, is ornate, for cartouches and arch motifs embellish the walls and dome. The floor of the prayer chamber is composed of multicolored tiles of the sort used on pre-Mughal Bengali structures. This unique flooring is in keeping with the mosque's articulated surfaces, related to that of contemporary architecture in Murshidabad, for example, Munni Begum's Chowk mosque built in 1767 (Plate 224).

Whether ornate or austere, religious architecture in Bihar, as in Awadh and Murshidabad, reveals virtually no European influence. There is no better example than the Bawli Hall mosque (Plate 222) on the estate of a nineteenthcentury residence. The mosque's central facade has a tri-lobed entrance arch and a parapet of domed *kungura,* recalling features of the 1841-42 mosque of Hamid cAli Khan, Delhi's last significant Mughal mosque (Plate 207). No European forms are used on the Bawli Hall mosque; rather, its design reflects contemporary work at the Mughal capital more than anything seen in the closer centers of Awadh and Murshidabad. By contrast, the residence reveals

![](_page_36_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 222. Bawli Hall mosque, Patna

considerable European influence following patterns set forth in Lucknow and Murshidabad. Bawli Hall, the nineteenth-century residence of Nawab Luft cAli Khan, was once an extensive mansion little different from contemporary British buildings in India. Now abandoned, it shows the extent that British architecture served as the model for houses of important figures in later Mughal successor states.

#### *Bengal: architecture under the nawabs of Murshidabad*

The architectural landscape of Bengal after Aurangzeb's death was dominated by three active groups, each responsible for different forms and types of buildings. Wealthy Hindu bankers, landholders and merchants built splendid terracotta temples in unprecedented numbers. An entire new city, Calcutta, developed under the British in a European idiom. Concurrently the Mughals and their successors, the nawabs of Murshidabad, embellished their own capital, only 200 km north of Calcutta.

Under previous Mughal rulers the capital of Bengal had fluctuated between Rajmahal and Dhaka. In 1703 Murshid Quli Khan, a high-ranking amir, shifted the administrative center from Dhaka to Murshidabad. By 1717 he had given himself unprecedented powers, paving the eventual break with the Mughal court. Murshid Quli Khan never ceased to regard himself as a Mughal agent,

![](_page_37_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 223. Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque, known as the Katra mosque, Murshidabad

even though he manifested signs of independence. For example, he annually remitted revenue to the imperial court in Delhi, but named the new Mughal capital after himself, in contrast with the earlier Mughal capitals of Bengal, Rajmahal and Dhaka, that initially had been named Akbarnagar and Jahangirnagar for the ruling Mughal monarchs.

Murshid Quli Khan's first architectural project in this new city was a Jamic mosque (Plate 223) constructed in 1724-25.<sup>13</sup> This impressive structure, originally surmounted by five domes, is today known as the Katra mosque. Its single-aisled plan is typical of the Mughal idiom in Bengal. However, several features recall the ornamentation of pre-Mughal Bengali architecture, for example, the facade's numerous niches. The mosque thus stands in contrast to the more refined buildings developed in Bengal during the time of Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb (Plates 154, 187 and 188). This break with the Mughal ornamental style parallels the patron's assertion of independence.

Surrounding the mosque are domed cloistered chambers used as a madrasa. The construction of this madrasa-cum-mosque, one of the very largest

Asher, "Inventory of Key Monuments," in Michell (ed.), The Islamic Heritage of Bengal, 87-104, this author's "The Mughal and Post-Mughal Periods," 206-11, in the same volume, and her forthcoming study, "Murshidabad: Regional Revival and Islamic Continuity," in A. L. Dallapiccola and S. Zingel-Ave Lallemant (eds.), Islam and Indian Regions, 1000-1750 A.D., forthcoming.

mosques in all Bengal, endows the city that hitherto held little religious significance with a dominant sacred importance - possibly an attempt to rival the traditional centers of piety in Bengal, Gaur and Pandua.

Less than fifty years later another Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque (Plate 224) was constructed by Munni Begum, the *de facto* ruler and highly influential wife of the recently deceased Nawab Mir Jac far. Known as the Chowk mosque, this elegant structure was built in 1767-68 in the tradition of Mughal, not pre-Mughal, mosques. The graduated size of the five rounded domes and two end-vaults flanked by slender minarets yield an overall appearance of restrained majesty. The interior and exterior are embellished with thickly applied plaster ornament. While more elaborate than that on the earlier Burdwan tomb, stucco ornamentation on structures erected under the Murshidabad nawabs remains considerably more subdued than that on buildings built by the nawabs of Awadh. The Chowk mosque, constructed at the height of Munni Begum's influence, was the most important religious structure in the city. Located on the ground of Murshid Quli Khan's former audience hall, this mosque may have been envisioned as the focal point for a politically rejuvenated Murshidabad under Munni Begum's leadership. In fact, however, the real power of Munni Begum and the succeeding nawabs had been eclipsed by the British.

From this time on, many mosques modeled on Munni Begum's were built in the city, although the embellishing motifs are less ornate. These mosques were almost always inscribed with the name of a patron, otherwise unknown, but never the name of the ruling nawab or British overlord. This suggests that mosques were no longer built as a means of gaining the favor of the ruler or of a powerful figure.

While mosques were the building type most commonly constructed in Murshidabad, two important religious complexes, each associated with the Shia sect, were built under private patronage in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. One is the Husainiya, located on the east bank of the Bhagirathi, in close proximity to the palace. This structure was intended to house portable models *(tac ziya)* of a building associated with the martyrdom of the Prophet's grandson, which were carried in procession at the time of Muharram. The Murshidabad Husainiya was commenced in 1804-05 and enlarged in 1854-55. A highly placed court eunuch, cAmber cAli Khan, was responsible for the initial construction, while another, Darab cAli Khan, was responsible for the later enlargement. Although they built the Husainiya as private citizens, they were nevertheless intimately linked with the court. The construction and renovation of a Husainiya facilitated the celebration of a religious rite observed in Shia Islam, the sect followed by the Murshidabad nawabs. The celebration of such rites appears to have become an increasingly important aspect of official ceremony under the Murshidabad nawabs. Since all important secular and political ritual was controlled by the East India

33°

Plate 224 Munni Begum's Jamic mosque, known as the Chowk mosque, Murshidabad

Company, it is not surprising that the nawabs might seek to foster religious ceremony. In Awadh, too, the nawabs promoted religious ceremony, having largely lost their authority over secular ritual.

Patronage by court eunuchs also was provided at Murshidabad's Qadam Sharif complex. The principal structure there is a shrine housing an impression said to be that of the Prophet Muhammad's foot. It was built in 1788-89 by Itwar cAli Khan, chief eunuch of Nawab Mir Jac far. This impression, said to be from Arabia, was removed from a shrine in Gaur; before that it had been housed in nearby Pandua. These cities each had served as the capital of the independent sultans of Bengal before Mughal times. In Gaur, the shrine housing this impression had been the focus of the city's sacral significance. Erected during the Husain Shahi dynasty, its importance continued into the Mughal period. Thus the transfer of the footprint to Murshidabad was intended to bolster the religious status of the city, whose administrative and economic role had been badly undermined six years earlier when government offices were shifted to Calcutta. Just as Murshid Quli Khan, the first nawab of Murshidabad, had attempted to transfer to Murshidabad the sacral significance that had been associated with Gaur, so, too, in the late eighteenth century, when the city's importance was greatly diminished, a similar attempt was made. The shrine's significance increased even more after 1858 and into the early

twentieth century, when it was revitalized in an attempt to infuse new life into this waning city, now almost entirely eclipsed by British power centered in Calcutta.

By the early nineteenth century, Murshidabad was the nawab's residence, nothing more. His powers continually reduced, he had to rely on the East India Company for his paltry annual stipend. The nawabs' utter dependence on the British is reflected in the residence of the nawab (Plate 225) constructed between 1829 and 1837. Designed by a European, Duncan McLeod, it follows the model of Government House in Calcutta, which in turn was modeled on Kedleston Hall in Derbyshire.

Yet, ten years after the completion of the palace, the nawab built to its north an enormous Imambara signaling his autonomy in matters religious. The Imambara's sheer size - some 80 meters longer than the palace itself underscores the notion that the patronage of religion and religious rite were among the few means for the nawabs to show authority independent of the British.

According to an inscription, the patron, Nawab Feredun Jah, appointed Sadiq cAli Khan as supervisor for the massive structure. He designed this Imambara, the largest in eastern India, with European features, in keeping with the palace opposite. Thus the appearance of the Imambara, an official structure

Plate 226. Sadiq cAli's mosque, known as the Chotte Chowk-ki Masjid, Murshidabad

part of the palace, stands in marked contrast to the city's privately patronized religious structures, all of which lack European motifs and forms.

That Europeanized features largely were reserved for official architecture is suggested by another mosque (Plate 226) commenced by the same architect who designed the great palace Imambara. This mosque completes an understanding of architecture in Murshidabad. Known as the Chotte Chowk-ki Masjid, it stands in an area earlier associated with Murshid Quli Khan's palace. An inscription over the central entrance ascribes its initial design and construction to Sadiq cAli. Since he died in 1850, much of it must have been completed by then. Contrary to what might be expected from the designer of the Imambara, this mosque is devoid of Europeanized features at a time when the near-contemporary mosques of Calcutta reveal considerable European influence. In fact, in plan and elevation it resembles Mughal-period structures in Bengal dating to Shah Jahan's time (Plate 154). That is, its simple cusped arches and plain facades have more in common with earlier Mughal structures than with the ornate facades of early nineteenth-century buildings in Murshidabad. This is characteristic of late non-imperial mosques of Murshidabad, those patronized by persons other than the nawab. They adhere to forms developed in Bengal much earlier in the Mughal period. This suggests that here, as in Awadh, the architectural styles developed under the Mughals

came, in Mughal splinter states, to be associated with the true architecture of piety, of Islam, and of the old social order, a style that by now had shed association with one or another ruling house. It was a style that stood in contrast to that built by the rulers, increasingly dominated by Britain as much in their architecture as in their authority.
