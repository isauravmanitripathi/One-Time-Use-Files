# THE BEGINNINGS OF MUGHAL ARCHITECTURE

# BABUR

# *Babur before his conquest of India*

Born in what is today the southern Soviet province of Uzbekistan, the Timurid Babur inherited the throne of a small principality known as Ferghana in 1494. He was then eleven years old. By the time he was twenty-one, he twice had held neighboring Samarqand, albeit briefly. For two years after his second loss of Samarqand, Babur, homeless and supported only by a tiny band of loyal followers, sought a principality. In 1504 his luck improved, and he captured Kabul and surrounding territories. In 1511, Babur tried for a third time to extend his rule to Samarqand, this time with support from the Safavid king Shah Ismac il. The Safavid extended his support only because Babur, a Sunni, had agreed to adopt trappings of the Shia creed, a heretical notion to the orthodox Sunni Muslims of Samarqand. Babur was able to enter the city and establish himself as its ruler. But within less than a year, the Sunni subjects of Samarqand withdrew support from Babur. After unsuccessful attempts to gain Bukhara, Babur returned to Kabul in 1512, once again holding only this province, nothing more.

While Babur's tenure in Samarqand had been short, the city's impact upon him was profound, shaping his attitude toward architecture and, even more significantly, toward landscape. Samarqand, embellished by Timur and his immediate successors with splendid *char bagh* gardens, mosques, madrasas and tombs, was one of the wonders of the fifteenth century. Babur was also deeply impressed by Herat, the seat of most cultured Timurid princes, which he had visited in 1507. Its many gardens and magnificent buildings are recorded in tourist-like fashion in his memoirs. These memoirs are not only intimate observations of his own exploits and travels, but also carefully observed descriptions of nature, be it human or the flora and fauna which abounded in his native Central Asia as well as in India. It thus comes as no surprise that among Babur's first enterprises in the province of Kabul was the layout of terraced, planted gardens with running streams. These doubtless were inspired by the gardens of Samarqand and Herat and reflected Babur's deep love of nature.

A true Timurid in spirit, Babur preferred to camp in gardens than reside in

19

any permanently constructed palace. Throughout his small principality, he either refurbished already existing gardens or created new ones. However, the creation of such gardens was not simply an indulgence in a personal pleasure or a whimsical pastime. They were used as camp sites, situated at a day's or halfday's horse ride from one another in the manner that other rulers built serais. The fruit of the gardens was consumed by Babur and his men, for frequently he refers to bananas, oranges or pomegranates eaten by his followers or given as special gifts. But such gardens probably had a greater significance. That is, the manipulation of natural untamed landscape into a rational, ordered creation was for Babur a metaphor for his ability to govern. Underscoring this is the allusion by Babur's faithful noble, Zain Khan, to "the garden of his [Babur's] powerful state," using other garden and floral imagery to proclaim Babur's regal character.<sup>1</sup>

The locations of many of these gardens, such as the ones at Nimla or Istalif, are known from Babur's writings as well as those of Zain Khan. They indicate the types of trees, flowers and fruit that grew in these terraced settings. Natural springs were formalized with stone edgings, streams were diverted through man-made watercourses and pavilions were constructed for the joy of the beholder. Of all Babur's gardens in Kabul province, the Bagh-i Wafa, or Garden of Fidelity, must have been his favorite, for he writes about it most frequently. Located near Jalalabad in modern Afghanistan, this garden lay close to the Khyber Pass, the only break in the mountain barrier between Kabul and Hindustan. Babur halted at the Bagh-i Wafa at various times over the next fifteen years. It was divided into four parts by running streams and planted with oranges, limes, pomegranates, bananas, sugar cane, jasmine, tulips and hyacinths, among other plants. Today none of these Afghan gardens exists in its original state, and even the location of many of them remains in doubt.

# *Babur's conquest of India*

Babur had long contemplated a conquest of India. As early as 1505 he made an initial foray as far as the Indus River, but until 1514 he largely aspired to retake his Central Asian territories. With this dream effectively quashed, Babur's thoughts turned again toward India. He then engaged a Turkish artillery-man and fortified his army with guns, weapons his Indian opponents lacked. He secured Qandahar, necessary in order to protect Kabul during long absences, and invaded India five times. Using innovative military tactics learned from Ustad cAli, his current head artillery-man, Babur's army defeated Sultan Ibrahim Lodi's more numerous foot and cavalry forces. Babur killed the Indian

sultan himself at the battle of Panipat in April, 1526. Declaring himself emperor of Hindustan, Babur established Agra as his capital. His first and most serious opponent was a Rajput Hindu, Rana Sangam of Mewar, leader of a largely Hindu-Rajput confederacy. A renowned warrior, Rana Sangam had also aspired to replace the Lodi sultans. His troops were defeated by Babur in March 1527 in close proximity to Fatehpur Sikri, a victory commemorated by the construction of large stepped wells. For the next several years until his premature death in 1530, Babur's career was devoted to conquering northern and eastern India. When he died, Babur bequeathed to his oldest son, Humayun, a shaky and as yet unconsolidated empire that extended from Afghanistan into Bihar.

# *Babur's Indian gardens*

Even before the battle of Panipat, Babur considered the Punjab, that is, the north-western territory between Delhi and Kabul, rightfully his since earlier it had been conquered by his ancestor, Timur. There, on a bitter cold, rainy day in February 1526, two months before his victory over the Lodis, Babur discovered a site near the Ghaggar river that he deemed ideal for a *char bagh.2* The garden, which he designed himself, was finished in 1528-29. Although it no longer survives, literary reports indicate that Babur's first Indian garden was built around a natural spring and that the garden itself was situated in a narrow mountain valley, a terrain close to that of Babur's own Kabul.

However, after his victory at Panipat in the hot summer month of April 1526, the morale of Babur's troops declined markedly. While Babur himself detested the heat, dust, flies and violent winds of the Indian summers, he was determined to stay, rallying the support of his followers. He responded to the climate by building gardens and baths. Gardens, ordered and regular, could shape the terrain to Babur's own liking and expectations. Running water required for all Mughal gardens was supplied by constructing Persian water wheels, in conjunction with deep stepped wells called *baolis.* Baths piped with hot and cold water were built in these gardens, for, as Babur states, inside such baths the heat and flying dust are shut out.<sup>3</sup> In Agra no suitable land for a garden existed, but Babur nevertheless laid out a *char bagh* that he named Hasht Behisht, the four-quartered Garden of Eight Paradises. It was situated on the east bank of the Jumna river. Although not stated explicitly, Babur's memoirs suggest that it served as his main residence and court, for it included baths, a large tank, an audience hall and private dwellings.

Babur, pp. 531-32, and Zain Khan, p. 161.

A second garden was constructed just inside the city's old fort.<sup>4</sup> By the end of 1526 this garden, its well, several stone structures and a mosque were completed. Babur disliked the mosque, for it was designed "in the Hindustani fashion," but the well pleased him, and he dedicated its completion to his victory over the Rana Sangam.<sup>5</sup> Some have associated this well with an extant *baoli* in the Agra fort, but that is probably a later project.

A second *baoli*, an octagonal one, is located at the base of the Fatehpur Sikri rock scarp about a kilometer from the Hiran Minar (Plate 27) constructed by Akbar later in the century. This was probably the original site of a well-known epigraph commemorating Babur's Fatehpur Sikri victory. A deep flight of stairs leads to the octagonal well; pillared and arched passageways mark each level of its shaft. These red sandstone corridors, which remain cool during the hot season, are embellished with rosettes, simply carved brackets and chandrashalas (elaborate niche-like forms) on pillar bases typically found during this period. While some writers confuse this *baoli* with the one Babur's memoirs describe in the Agra fort garden,<sup>6</sup> he probably constructed a *baoli* in each place, recording only one in his memoirs.

Agra, Babur's capital, figures large in his memoirs, but he much loved Fatehpur Sikri, which he named Shukri, or Thanks, for its large lake with water much needed by Mughal troops. Following his defeat of the rana on the outskirts of Fatehpur Sikri, Babur constructed a garden there called the Garden of Victory.<sup>7</sup> In it he built an octagonal pavilion which he used for relaxation and writing. In the center of a nearby lake he built a large platform.<sup>8</sup>

Only two of Babur's Indian gardens can be identified with any certainty. One is in Agra, today called the Ram Bagh. Although its original name is open to some dispute, it was probably the Gul Afshan garden, which served as Babur's burial site until his body was transferred to a garden in Kabul in accordance with his final wishes. A water-course with pools symmetrically dividing the terraced garden is still evident, although it belongs to Jahangir's reign (1605–27), when the garden underwent extensive renovations.

The second of Babur's gardens that can be identified is at Dholpur, today in Bharatpur District, Rajasthan. It is his Bagh-i Nilufar, or Lotus garden, described in his memoirs. Located atop the red sandstone ridge that looms high above the Chambal river, the Lotus garden is situated some 50 km south of Agra. The site, like all the settings for his gardens, was chosen by Babur personally, spotted when the emperor was examining a Lodi-period reservoir.

Plate 6. Pool, Bagh-i Nilufar (Lotus garden), Dholpur

Babur describes the process of building the garden in some detail and refers to a mosque, bath, well, twenty-six rock spouts, pillars, watercourses cut terracelike into the terrain, and stone platforms. The bath, well and water channels are still extant, although little remains of the garden's original character; however, a centrally situated large lotus-shaped pool (Plate 6) as well as smaller pools, some with edging resembling lotus petals, are still visible. Lotus-shaped pools and tanks had been used earlier in India, for example in the Sultanate of Mandu, but the notion of terraced symmetrical gardens divided into four quarters by courses of running water was introduced into India by Babur.

No traces of the original planting remain, but the placement and choice of plants at the Lotus garden, as at all Babur's gardens, were probably by the emperor. For example, melons brought from Kabul were grown successfully in Agra, grapes were introduced into India, trees were grafted and flowers especially cultivated for their color. His memoirs reveal a deep personal involvement with the cultivation of plants and flowers for his own gardens, and one section is devoted solely to a discussion of the fruits and trees of Hindustan. In short, Babur knew all potential plantings for his garden, and he demonstrated himself ultimate master and creator of each garden. Recalling that Zain Khan uses the garden metaphor for Babur's state, Babur's portrayal of himself as its master assumes special significance.

Babur issued orders that regular, symmetrical gardens and orchards were to

**23**

be laid out in all large cities.<sup>9</sup> A garden constructed in conjunction with a mosque was completed in Panipat upon imperial order.<sup>10</sup> In Gwalior, Rahim Dad, superintendent of Gwalior fort, constructed his own garden.<sup>11</sup> It no longer remains, although a madrasa constructed in a local style adjacent to the garden does. Doubtless other gardens not mentioned in the memoirs were built as well. This introduction of a new aesthetic and ordering of the land, a land that Babur refers to as "disorderly Hind,"<sup>12</sup> should be construed as concrete evidence of the Mughals' Timurid heritage. That these four-part, ordered gardens represented a Timurid tradition, even in the eyes of Babur's Indian subjects, may be surmised from their names. The area in Agra developed under Babur's nobles, Zain Khan, Yunus 'Ali and Khalifa, was called Kabul by local inhabitants;<sup>13</sup> and today the area in Panipat where Babur's garden originally stood is still called Kabuli Bagh.

# The quest for a Mughal style

Babur's memoirs indicate that the construction of permanent buildings assumed less importance for him than the construction of gardens. Just as he camped in gardens in Kabul when moving from site to site, so too in India the garden served as his camp. Moreover, his precarious financial situation – where the payment of troops had to be his first priority – left fewer resources for large stone monuments. Nevertheless, buildings were constructed, enough to employ almost 1,500 stone cutters at work on projects throughout his north Indian domain.<sup>14</sup>

Babur's view of indigenous Indian architecture is only partially reflected in his comment about a mosque within his Agra fort garden. He considered the building unattractively constructed in the "Hindustani fashion."<sup>15</sup> While his objections are vague, Zain Khan elaborates that the foundations as well as the walls of this Agra mosque were strong, constructed of brick and stone, but the "composition was not conformable,"<sup>16</sup> that is, not harmonious, referring to the spatial organization, doubtless much less sophisticated than that of Timurid prototypes. But Babur did not dislike all Indian architecture, for he describes favorably at some length the palaces of the Gwalior fort, praising especially those of Man Singh Tomar discussed in the previous chapter. Its special appeal lay in the carved stone walls, tiled facades and exterior chattris.<sup>17</sup> Just as Timur had admired Indian stone masons and some 225 years earlier had carried some back to work on his own buildings in Samarqand, so Babur - who had noted this in his memoirs - also favored the work of these artisans and employed

them freely.<sup>18</sup> Still today the hand of Indian masons is evident on the tanks at the Dholpur Lotus garden. These masons had been rewarded with gifts by Babur, who admired their craft.<sup>19</sup> He was astonished at the ability of Indian masons to inlay and bond pieces of colored stone without the use of mortar.<sup>20</sup>

In spite of his admiration for Indian craftsmen, Babur was concerned that the overall design of his structures in India should be modeled on Khurasani, that is, Timurid examples.<sup>21</sup> Such models, for example, were probably followed in the design of one structure in the Agra Hasht Behisht garden. Although it is only known from textual description, it appears to have had a large *pishtaq* on each of four sides, connecting galleries and four small interior chambers.<sup>22</sup> Possibly to insure fidelity to Timurid models, two artisans from Central Asia came to work for Babur in India. One was Mir Mirak Ghiyas, identified as a stone cutter in Babur's memoirs, possibly identical with Mirak Sayyid Ghiyas, the designer of Humayun's tomb, who came from Herat and owned much land in Khurasan.<sup>23</sup> A second stone cutter, Ustad Shah Muhammad, first had served Babur in Qandahar before his incursions into India and continued in his employ until at least 1529, the year before Babur's death.<sup>24</sup> These men doubtless enjoyed a status far higher than that of ordinary craftsmen, for routine workers would not have been identified by name.

Among the buildings of Babur's time that survive are one imperially patronized mosque and two others constructed by nobles on Babur's orders. These were all built in the final years of his reign. This is notable, for until Babur's conquest of India there is no evidence for his patronage of religious structures.<sup>25</sup>

The mosque that Babur himself provided is in Panipat, today in Karnal District of Haryana State (Plates 7-8). Inscriptions indicate that the mosque was well under way, if not finished, by the end of 1527, and its gate, well and garden were finished by  $1528$ . The mosque is not mentioned in literary sources; Babur's memoirs contain lacunae for this period, and Zain Khan's work ends abruptly with the events of early 1527. Nevertheless, we can certainly assume that the complex commemorates Babur's decisive victory over Sultan Ibrahim Lodi at Panipat and thus the Mughal conquest of Hindustan.

Since the garden has disappeared, the mosque's location within it is not known. However, the building's large size suggests that it, rather than the garden, dominated the complex. The rectangular prayer chamber, measuring

Plate 7. Babur's mosque, today known as Kabuli Bagh mosque, Panipat

53.75 by 16.50 meters, is dominated by a large central domed bay flanked on either side by three-bayed triple-aisled side wings. Each bay of the side wings is entered by an arched opening supported on massive piers. Over the mosque's brick construction is a heavy stucco veneer, reminiscent of that covering much Sultanate architecture. The northwest and southwest corners of the mosque were marked by octagonal towers crowned by domed pavilions, although only one survives. Each of the mosque's bays is surmounted by a dome, those over the westernmost aisle being smaller than those on the east.

The large central bay's qibla wall, the one oriented toward Mecca, is stonefaced, but elsewhere the veneer on the mosque's interior is stucco over a brick core. This central bay is the mosque's focal point, visible even from the outside

through the wide entrance. Attention is drawn to the mihrab by an epigraph including the Throne Verse from the Quran, and an historical inscription dated 1527—28 — rendered dramatically in black stone against white marble. While the chamber itself is a simple domed structure, recalling the Lodi Bara Gumbad built in Delhi's Lodi Gardens in 1494, the appearance of net pendentives here used only decoratively, evokes a Timurid flavor. Each side wing is divided into two aisles by massive brick piers; the resulting bays are crowned by domes resting on brick pendentives that are covered by a thick stucco veneer modeled to resemble net squinches, introduced to north India by the Mughals.

A stone gate stands in the courtyard's north wall. It is carved in the tradition of earlier Lodi gates, for example that at the Lodi-period tomb of Khwaja Khizr dated 1522-24 in nearby Sonepat. Most of the enclosure wall has disappeared, but remains suggest that the entire courtyard was walled and that each side had similar gates.

The Panipat mosque's prayer chamber appears to have been loosely modeled on the type of congregational mosque used by the Timurids. It also incorporates features of mosques built by the pre-Lodi sultans in this region. This mosque type, however, was favored by Babur not because of any earlier Indian associations, but for two rather different reasons. First, it is decidedly different from the single-aisled multi-bayed type used exclusively by Babur's immediate predecessors, the Afghan Lodis. Notably at Panipat, the site of this mosque, Babur had defeated the Lodis. Second, it is a type that, although somewhat transformed in the process of Indian translation, had been constructed by Timur, for example in his Bibi Khanum mosque in Samargand. As the Mughal Babur was the only surviving Timurid ruler, it must have been especially important for him to preserve at least a vestige of Timurid architectural forms.

A vestige it is, no more, surprising in light of Babur's admiration for the architecture of the great Central Asian Timurid cities Samargand and Herat. Despite his regard for Timurid architecture, it could not be replicated on Indian soil. It appears that there were only a few artists trained in the Timurid homeland and probably no architect capable of introducing the complex Timurid engineering principles. Moreover, Babur lacked the wealth needed for such construction.<sup>26</sup> Instead, local architects and artisans relied closely on older but familiar Indian techniques.

Two other mosques remain that were constructed by leading nobles following Babur's orders. Probably these orders were general ones, not commands to erect specific mosques. One of these mosques is at Sambhal (Plate 9), about 140 km east of Delhi. It was constructed in 1526 by Mir Hindu Beg, an important noble in the court of both Babur and Humayun. Built a year before Babur's Kabuli Bagh mosque in Panipat, the Sambhal mosque is the first extant Mughal building in India. The complex is entered through a gate on the east that opens to a large walled courtyard. The prayer chamber, like the one of the Panipat mosque, is rectangular with a large square central bay. Its entrance is set into a high *pishtag*, recalling those of Sharqi mosques at Jaunpur. The chamber is flanked on either side by three-bayed double-aisled side wings. A single dome surmounts the central bay, and a small flatish dome surmounts each bay of the side wings. The mosque's *pishtag* and other features resembling fifteenthcentury Sharqi structures in nearby Jaunpur suggest a reliance on local artisans and designers.

Even though the Sambhal mosque was renovated at least twice in the seventeenth century, enough of its original state remains to show that the plan and general appearance anticipate Babur's Panipat mosque commenced the following year.<sup>27</sup> The size (40.5 by 12.4 meters), too, anticipates the scale of Babur's imperial mosque, thus making this mosque at Sambhal the largest one constructed in the Delhi region since Timur's sack of that city in 1398. This mosque is situated high on a hill and dominates the city for a considerable distance. According to Hindu lore that was known to the Mughals, the tenth and last incarnation of Vishnu will appear in Sambhal at the end of this era (vuga).28

Plate 9. Mir Hindu Beg's mosque, Sambhal

A second mosque (Plate 10) probably built in response to Babur's general orders, not a specific command, stands at Ayodhya, today in Faizabad District, on the banks of the Ghaghara river. Three inscriptions indicate it was constructed by Mir Baqi, a noble, in 1528-29, that is, after the mosques at Sambhal and Panipat. Unlike the other mosques built under Babur's auspices, this one at Ayodhya is a single-aisled three-bayed type. It is also considerably smaller than the other two. The central bay's *pishtaq* is much higher than the flanking side bays, but all three bays contain arched entrances. Most of the mosque is stucco-covered, over a rubble or brick core, but carved black stone columns from a pre-twelfth-century temple are embedded into either side of the central entrance porch. The mosque is surmounted by three prominent domes.

The site today is highly charged. Many claim the mosque, situated on a hillock, replaces a temple which Babur had destroyed. Today this mound popularly is considered the birthplace of the Hindu deity Rama. An important Mughal chronicler, writing about seventy years after the mosque's construction, acknowledges Ayodhya's sanctity as Rama's dwelling,<sup>29</sup> but says nothing about the exact site of Rama's birth. It is thus difficult to disentangle recent popular passion from historical accuracy.

All the same, Ayodhya was a site of great importance to Babur's Hindu

subjects in the Mughal period. The incorporation of older Hindu architectural members prominently displayed on the mosque's facade, at a period when the reuse of Hindu material was highly unusual, suggests the patron. Mir Bagi, was attempting to make a general statement of Muslim superiority.<sup>30</sup> This mosque, then, like the others of Babur's time, appears to be located in an area that had a charged significance. Babur's own mosque in Panipat was built on the site of Lodi defeat and Mughal victory, while the other two sites were both associated. however loosely, with ancient Hindu tradition.

Babur's choice of Panipat for a mosque is not difficult to understand. However, the construction of mosques on sites associated with non-Islamic tradition is less comprehensible for a ruler who claimed his right to sovereignty based on his Timurid heritage and Turkishness, not on religious grounds.<sup>31</sup> While such rhetoric predominated in his pre-India conquest, once he established himself permanently in India, Babur added the establishment of Islam as a mission of his rule. He referred to Hindus as *kafirs*, that is, pagans or infidels, and war against his greatest Indian threat, Rana Sangam, was termed jihad or holy war.<sup>32</sup> Shortly after his victory over Rana Sangam, Babur assumed the title Ghazi, that is, a warrior dedicated to the cause of Islam, and wrote a verse stating his resolve to defeat Hindus and pagans.<sup>33</sup> All this rhetoric followed the long-established practice of Islamic rulers conquering non-Islamic lands. The placement of the Ayodhya and Sambhal mosques by his nobles in generally charged locales was well in keeping with the spirit of Babur's new legitimizing rhetoric.

Babur ruled Hindustan for less than five years before his death in December, 1530. Although he ruled for only a short time, he introduced Timurid architectural concepts and, most importantly, the rationally organized four-part paradise garden. This latter in particular was to become a Mughal trademark.

#### HUMAYUN

#### Humayun's reign

In 1530 Humayun, designated by Babur as his successor, acceded to the throne. Humayun was sensitive, kind and intelligent, but lacked long-term wisdom and a mature understanding of statecraft. He had proven himself capable in warfare; however, he was inclined to lose the fruits of his victory by abandoning himself to long periods of pleasure and celebration. For example, after victories in Gujarat, Mandu and Gaur, Humayun remained in the palaces of the

### HUMAYUN

defeated for extended periods. Meanwhile the Mughal opponents' strength increased, giving them time to plot Humayun's downfall. The most serious of these adversaries was the Afghan, Sher Shah Sur, based in eastern India.

Humayun underestimated Sher Shah's potential and occupied himself with lesser rivals in western India. In 1536, Humayun, alarmed by reports of Sher Shah's activities, headed toward Bihar and Bengal, where he captured Gaur, the Bengal capital. Apparently unaware that Sher Shah had proclaimed himself sultan, Humayun spent the next nine months in pursuit of pleasure in Gaur, even renaming the city Jannatabad, or Abode of Paradise. This led to his defeat in 1538 in a decisive battle with Sher Shah at Chausa, in Bihar. The Mughal emperor managed to escape across the swollen Ganges river, although most of his retinue drowned in its waters. He was then forsaken by his brothers, each of whom sought the Mughal crown for himself. As a result of this division, Humayun was again defeated by Sher Shah, this time at Kanauj in 1540. Sher Shah then assumed the throne of Delhi and drove Humayun from Hindustan. Homeless, Humayun and his wife, Hamida, were pursued through Rajasthan, where their first son, Akbar, was born in 1542. Reaching Kabul in 1543, they left the prince Akbar there in the charge of one of Humayun's brothers. Although Humayun himself was not safe from his brothers' treachery, Timurid custom protected the young child.

By 1544, Humayun reached Iran and found refuge in the Safavid court of Shah Tahmasp. The relationship between the deposed Mughal and this Safavid ruler was not a comfortable one, since Shah Tahmasp insisted that Humayun embrace Shiism just as Babur had been forced to do some years earlier. Nevertheless, Shah Tahmasp's support eventually enabled Humayun to regain the Mughal throne in 1555. These years in Iran introduced Humayun not only to Safavid painters and painting but also to the architecture of Herat and Samarqand and to the Timurid-Safavid Iranian traditions that Babur had so admired.

### *Humayun's patronage*

With the exception of a single inscribed mosque in Agra, no other surviving structure indisputably results from Humayun's patronage. Some hold that the Delhi Purana Qal<sup>c</sup> a, its mosque and octagonal pavilion (Plate n ) also are his. Despite the dearth of remaining buildings from Humayun's time, contemporary sources refer to his architectural output. They describe, for example, his unique conceptions, although they are based on Timurid design concepts. One of them was a floating palace formed from four barges each bearing an inward facing arch and attached in such a manner that an octagonal pool formed the central portion. In addition, he designed three-storied collapsible palaces, gilded and domed.

More traditional palaces were constructed at Gwalior, Agra and Delhi. Neither the Gwalior palace, constructed of chiselled stones, nor the multistoried Agra palace, with its octagonal tank, connected via subterranean passages to other parts of the palaces, survives.

Much controversy centers around Humayun's role in erecting the fortified enclosure today known as Delhi's Purana Qal<sup>c</sup> a. Humayun commenced a walled city and imperial palace on this site in 1533. The city, named Din-Panah or Refuge of Religion, was auspiciously situated upon the age-old site known as Indraprastha, long associated with the traditional Hindu epic *Mahabharata.* The city was also located in very close proximity to the shrine of Delhi's most revered saint, Nizam al-Din Auliya. The choice of the site must have been made with its history in mind, for Humayun, superstitious yet religious, sought advice from learned men as well as astrologers. Even after Humayun's victorious return to India in 1555, this site remained symbolic for the Mughals, for, as we shall see, Humayun's tomb was constructed in this same area.

Khwand Amir, a noble in Humayun's court, reports that by 1534 the "walls, bastions, ramparts and gates" of Humayun's Din-Panah were nearly completed, adding that it was hoped that the "great and lofty buildings" of the city

soon would be finished.<sup>34</sup> It is difficult to tell from Khwand Amir's bombastic prose exactly how much of the city in reality was ready by 1534; moreover, it is impossible to judge how much was completed before Sher Shah's accession to the Delhi throne in 1540, for Humayun was constantly engaged in defending the Mughal domain and struggling to maintain his crown. Sher Shah probably completed the fort and constructed its interior Qalca-i Kuhna mosque discussed in the previous chapter. Humayun almost certainly built the fort's small octagonal pavilion, known as the Sher Mandal (Plate 11) and traditionally associated with the library upon whose steps Humayun fatally fell in 1556, less than a year after his successful return to India. Abu al-Fazl, the official chronicler of Humayun's son and successor, Akbar, writes that the building in which Humayun had his fatal accident had only recently been completed,<sup>35</sup> presumably by Humayun. The pavilion's design, close to Timurid garden pavilions and unlike Sultanate architectural types, suggests Mughal

patronage. So does the appearance of the net pendentives in the structure's vaulting.

The sole inscribed monument belonging to Humayun's patronage is a mosque in Agra known after the name of its locality, Kachpura (Plate 12). Two inscriptions indicate that the mosque was completed in 1530, the year of Humayun's accession to the throne. Its location, across the Jumna from the land on which the Taj Mahal was later built, may have been the site of the Hasht Behisht garden, or Garden of Eight Paradises, used for Babur's court. This garden also most likely continued to serve as Humayun's court until he constructed his Delhi citadel.36 Like Babur's mosques, this one in Kachpura is mentioned in no text. It resembles Babur's Panipat mosque (Plates 7 and 8) in general plan and appearance, although the central *pishtaq* is much higher and the central vaulted chamber achieves a greater sense of open space than did the only slightly earlier Mughal mosques. The open character of the central bay with low flanking bays recalls earlier Timurid mosques, for example the Jamic mosque at Nishapur. As at Babur's Panipat mosque, stucco covers a brick core. On Humayun's mosque, eight-pointed stars and lozenge patterns are imprinted into the rectangular facade; possibly these were once painted to emphasize the design, evoking the brightly colored glazed tile ornamentation of Herat and Samarqand. The mosque today is ruined, so it is unclear how many bays originally composed the double-aisled side wings. The interior central bay is surmounted by a dome supported on kite-shaped pedentives and net squinches. The smaller domes of the resulting side wings are similarly supported. While no traces of enclosure walls and entrance gates remain, they were almost certainly part of the original plan. The overall appearance and plan of this structure suggests that it, like Babur's Panipat mosque, was intended to emulate older Timurid types.

# NON-IMPERIAL ARCHITECTURE UNDER BABUR AND HUMAYUN

Architecture erected in the Delhi region by those close to Babur and Humayun appears little influenced by Timurid concepts; rather, what remains reflects the older Lodi style. The most significant examples are at the shrine *(dargah)* around the tomb of Nizam al-Din Auliya. Belonging to the Chishti order, Nizam al-Din is Delhi's most esteemed Muslim saint. This shrine gained renewed significance in the Mughal period. In it is the tomb of Amir Khusrau (d. 1325), considered the greatest Persian poet of Hindustan. This tomb was restored by Babur's brother-in-law, who provided an inscribed marble slab next to an open-air grave. In Humayun's reign, in 1531-32, a red sandstone

screened enclosure (Plate 13) was built around the grave.37 This screen, carved with geometric and floral patterns, recalls Lodi-period tombs, for example that of Yusuf Qattal, also in Delhi.

Other monuments of this time include the mosque of Ghazanfar, constructed in 1528-29 during Babur's reign near the Delhi airport in Palam. In another part of Delhi, Malvianagar, a residential center for spiritual study *(khanqah)* was built in 1534-35 to honor Shaikh Farid al-Din Ganj-i Shakar, a long deceased saint. That makes it contemporary with Humayun's Din-Panah, although it reveals no awareness of new imperial forms. Both the mosque and *khanqah* are squat single-aisled three-bayed structures notable for neither their proportions nor ornamentation.

Inscriptions indicate that mosques, tombs and other structures continued to be erected by men of all ranks and classes outside of Delhi during the early Mughal period. However, few of these remain in their original state. Like subimperial monuments in the Delhi area, they reveal little or no Timurid influence. For example, the tomb of Tardi Kochak in Hisar, dated 1537-38 by

a stucco inscription incised on its facade,38 is a square-plan structure whose facade is articulated by a series of slightly recessed niches closely resembling the Lodi-period tombs of Delhi.

One more structure suggests the persistence of the older Lodi style. It is a small three-bayed single-aisled mosque in Fatehabad (Hisar District, Haryana), known as the Humayuni mosque (Plate 14). An inscription now detached from the structure bears the date 1539 and describes the construction of a mosque during Humayun's reign. This is probably the very mosque identified in the inscription.<sup>39</sup> Although another inscription on the mosque indicates that it was renovated in the nineteenth century, features from the time of Humayun are quite apparent. Small glazed tiles on the east facade, for example, are reminiscent of those on two sixteenth-century buildings in Hansi, about 30 km away: the Barsi gate restored in 1522 and the tomb of cAli Mir Tijara.

#### THE LEGACY BEQUEATHED

Ibn Khaldun, the fourteenth-century Islamic political thinker and historian, observed that the founders of dynasties generally channel substantial effort into consolidating their political strength, leaving little time for extensive architectural construction.<sup>40</sup> Nonetheless, the architecture of both Babur and Humayun sowed the seeds for future construction under the Mughals. This is especially true for the *types* of works built, although the purpose and meaning will change somewhat as the state matures and evolves its unique notions of legitimacy. Babur introduced the *char bagh* garden, which for him was a visual metaphor for his ability to control and order the arid Indian plains and ultimately its population. Subsequently such gardens gain even greater popularity, especially when used as a paradisical setting for funereal monuments. Before his conquest of India, Babur had built no mosques. In Hindustan, however, he

built mosques, probably because of his newly assumed role as a warrior in the cause of Islam. Humayun, too, built at least one mosque; however, his construction of palaces and pleasure pavilions reflected his apparent selfindulgence. The palace and its role as the center of regal ceremony, increasingly significant in each ruler's interpretation of the nature of Mughal kingship, continues as a major architectural form through the eighteenth century. Babur and Humayun, each keenly aware of their Timurid heritage, attempted to introduce Timurid-inspired architectural forms and spatial conceptions into India. Although the outcome was not necessarily successful, the ideology behind such forms is maintained by their Mughal successors.
