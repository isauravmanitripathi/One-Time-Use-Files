#### CHAPTER 3

# THE AGE OF AKBAR

#### MUGHAL THEORIES OF KINGSHIP AND STATE POLITY

Akbar is generally recognized as the greatest and most capable of the Mughal rulers. Under him Mughal polity and statecraft reached maturity; and under his guidance the Mughals changed from a petty power to a major dynastic state. From his time to the end of the Mughal period, artistic production on both an imperial and sub-imperial level was closely linked to notions of state polity, religion and kingship.

Humayun died in 1556, only one year after his return to Hindustan. Upon hearing the call to prayers, he slipped on the steep stone steps of the library in his Din-Panah citadel in Delhi. Humayun's only surviving son and heirapparent, Akbar, then just fourteen years of age, ascended the throne and ruled until 1605 the expanding Mughal empire. Until about 1561, Akbar was under the control of powerful court factions, first his guardian, Bhairam Khan, and then the scheming Maham Anga, a former imperial wet-nurse. Between about 1560 and 1580, Akbar devoted his energies to the conquest and then the consolidation of territory in north India. This he achieved through battle, marriage, treaty and, most significantly, administrative reform. Concurrent with these activities, Akbar developed an interest in religion that, while initially a personal concern, ultimately transformed his concept of state. Many of the policies he adopted, such as the renunciation of the poll-tax (jiziya) for non-Muslims, had a solid political basis as well as a personal one, for Akbar, much more than his Mughal predecessors, saw every advantage in maintaining good relations with the Hindu majority. Moreover, during this period, Akbar equally was interested in winning over the sympathy of orthodox Indian Muslims. In part, his goal was to reduce the power of the dominant Iranian nobles, that is, Persian and Central Asian nobles, by including Indians, both Hindu and Muslim, in his administration.

Always interested in religious affairs, Akbar showed a deep reverence for saints belonging to the Islamic Chishti order. His devotion to them peaked between 1568 and 1579. This coincides with the period that he commenced the *khangah* and palace at Fatehpur Sikri, whose construction was stimulated by his spiritual guide (*pir*) who resided there. Commencing about 1575, Akbar's interest in religions and religious matters broadened. First, he invited learned men from diverse Islamic sects and later Christian priests, Hindus, Jains and

Zoroastrians to join him in discussions, which more often than not turned into petty disputes, particularly among the leading Muslim thinkers. The result led Akbar increasingly away from formalized religion and into a deep personal spiritualism with strong mystical overtones, but one that was rooted within the font of Islam.

The events of the later part of his reign were marked by an attempt to control the Deccan plateau of central south India and territory in the northwest including Kashmir, Qandahar and Baluchistan. His final years were spent in conflict with his only surviving son, Salim, the future Jahangir, who rebelled against his father, establishing his own court in Allahabad. Eventually Salim and Akbar were reconciled, but it is believed by some that Akbar died poisoned by his son.

Our knowledge of Akbar's thought and policy comes from the writings of Abu al-Fazl, Akbar's chronicler and close companion. The first part of his massive Persian text commenced about 1589 was the *Akbar Nama,* or the *Book of Akbar;* it is a eulogistic chronicle of the events of Akbar's reign. The second part, known as the *A 'in-i Akbari,* or *Regulations of Akbar,* is a manual of statecraft. Together these present Akbar's mature concept of kingship and state. These, in large measure, continued to serve as the basis of the Mughal state.

Abu al-Fazl presents Akbar as a divinely inspired ruler who traced his lineage not only to his esteemed ancestor, Timur, but back further to a Mughal princess whose offspring were the products of a miraculous impregnation by light.1 Describing Akbar as an emanation of God's light, Abu al-Fazl plays upon light imagery, presenting the emperor as a superior being who had a special relationship with God. By contrast, earlier Islamic kings were considered but shadows of God on earth.

Abu al-Fazl's writings indicate that Akbar, adhering to well-established Perso-Islamic concepts of sovereignty, believed that the ultimate justification for the Mughal empire was the propagation of justice. He presents Akbar not only as divinely inspired, but also as a paternal figure concerned for his subjects' welfare. As patriarch of the state, Akbar's mantle does not only extend to Muslims, traditionally the only valid subjects of an Islamic state, but to non-Muslims as well. For example, in 1579, he issued a declaration *(mahzar)* allowing in some instances the emperor, rather than Islamic judges, to decide matters that affected the lives of all his subjects. Akbar further underscored toleration as a major concern of state by declaring his policy of *sulh-i kul,* universal toleration. That extended the canopy of justice to all, regardless of religious affiliation, thus establishing the groundwork for the successful and long-term domination of an Islamic state in the midst of a non-Muslim majority.

#### AKBAR'S PATRONAGE

Under Akbar, Mughal administration was divided into three categories: the household, the army and the empire. Akbar was the head of each of these, and it was to him personally that all high-ranking nobles answered. To further perpetuate his role as the head of state and as father to his people, Akbar established the Din-i Ilahi, a disciple-like relationship between himself and his most trusted nobles. Many have interpreted the Din-i Ilahi as a new religion. This is a misunderstanding, resulting in part from the nature of Akbar's relationship with his highest-ranking nobles. This relationship can be likened to that between an Islamic spiritual guide (*pir*) and his devotees (*murids*), or a master and his slave. Understanding the nobles' commitment to Akbar helps explain the diffusion of a uniform aesthetic across Mughal territory.

# AKBAR'S PATRONAGE

## Architecture in Delhi (1556-76)

Delhi, the traditional capital of north Indian Islamic rulers, served as Akbar's capital until 1565, when he commenced his massive Agra fort. This was followed by the construction of other forts in strategically important locations signaling the diminishing importance of Delhi, until its revival in the midseventeenth century.

While ruling from Delhi, Akbar continued to reside in Humayun's citadel, Din-Panah. There is no example of Akbar's architecture from these early years, but leading members of his court built mosques and tombs close to the Din-Panah. For example, the Khair al-Manazil mosque and madrasa were constructed in 1561 by Maham Anga. She had been one of Akbar's wet-nurses and had considerable influence over the young king during this early period. Erected under the supervision of Shihab al-Din Ahmad Khan, her son-in-law, the mosque closely follows the plan and elevation of the nearby Qalca-i Kuhna mosque probably built by Sher Shah. Her mosque is embellished with incised stucco and paint in lieu of inlaid stone. Its courtyard is enclosed with high cloistered walls used as a madrasa. The dominant feature of the mosque, however, is not the prayer chamber, but its monumental east gate (Plate 15). It is faced with red and white stones like those on the entrance gates into the Din-Panah. This gate, which lay on a main thoroughfare linking the fort with the city walls, commanded a dominant position in the city.

Nearby is the shrine (*dargah*) of Nizam al-Din Auliya. Restorations had been made there in Babur's and Humayun's reigns, and further renovations were made in Akbar's time. In 1562 a noble of Akbar's court, Farid al-Khan, rebuilt Nizam al-Din's tomb. The walls of this square-plan tomb consist of marble screens (jalis) supported by intricately carved pillars; the carved geometric patterns are more finely rendered than those on the nearby tomb of

Plate 15. Gate, Khair al-Manazil mosque, Delhi

Khusrau (Plate 13) carved in Humayun's reign. It is with this tomb that marble, probably in emulation of the tomb of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din in Ajmer, becomes an emblem of sanctity in Mughal architecture.

In the *dargah* of Nizam al-Din is the tomb of Ataga Khan (Plate 16), built in 1*566-67* by his son Mirza cAziz Koka. Ataga Khan, Akbar's prime minister and the husband of one of his wet-nurses, was murdered in 1562 by the jealous son of Maham Anga. The square plan of this tomb follows the older Indian tombtypes, while its red sandstone exterior inlaid with multi-colored stones and white marble slabs carved with Quranic verses reflects the influence of the exquisite Qal<sup>c</sup> a-i Kuhna mosque (Plate 5). This is the first Akbar-period monument for which we know the names of both the architect, Ustad Khuda Quli, and the calligrapher, Baqi Muhammad of Bukhara. The verses on the tomb were chosen carefully, referring specifically to the nature of Ataga Khan's demise, which Akbar's court chronicler Abu al-Fazl likens to martyrdom.<sup>2</sup>

Ataga Khan's murderer, Adham Khan, was immediately punished by death. Adham Khan's large octagonal tomb (Plate 17), containing his grave and that of his mother, who died a few months later, was erected by imperial order

Plate 16. Partial facade, tomb of Ataga Khan, Delhi

15 km south of Akbar's Delhi.<sup>3</sup> By contrast to Ataga Khan's tomb, reflecting the apex of Mughal technology and taste, his murderer's tomb, stucco covered and octagonal in format, represents the end of this older type. Octagonal tombs once had been associated with royalty, for example by the Surs, considered traitors by the Mughals. Thus a tomb-type associated with traitors was particularly suitable for the once-leading, now disgraced, noble, Adham Khan.

Timurid features are often evident in some of the most important Akbari buildings in Delhi, including his finest work there, his father's tomb. Many of these features are, however, largely dropped in Akbar's buildings constructed after moving the capital to Agra. Among the works that recall architecture in the Mughal homeland is the Sabz Burj, located south of the citadel. The tomb is probably a product of Akbar's reign, although it may date as early as Humayun's reign. It is designed as a Baghdadi octagon (see glossary) with a high dome resting on an elongated neck; originally green tiles covered its surface.

At least as clearly based on Timurid prototypes is the largest structure erected in Delhi during the early years of Akbar's reign, the tomb of the deceased emperor Humayun (Plates 18-19). Situated just south of the Din-Panah citadel and in close proximity to the esteemed *dargah* of Nizam al-Din,

Plate 17. Tomb of Adham Khan, Delhi

the mausoleum even today dominates its surroundings. A contemporary Mughal source indicates that the tomb was finished in 1571 after eight or nine years of work.<sup>4</sup> Tradition states that a devoted wife, Hajji Begum, was responsible for its construction; recently, however, Akbar has been proposed as the patron,<sup>5</sup> even though the tomb resembles none of Akbar's other architectural enterprises. Its Timurid appearance must be credited to its Iranian architect, trained in the Timurid tradition and known from contemporary texts as both Mirak Sayyid Ghiyas and Mirak Mirza Ghiyas.<sup>6</sup> His masterpiece came to be influential in the design of Mughal mausolea through the eighteenth century.

Mirak Mirza Ghiyas, originally from Herat, may have been a stone cutter who had worked for Babur. He worked extensively in Bukhara, where he excelled at buildings and landscape architecture. Around 1562, he returned to India to design Humayun's tomb. Before its completion, however, he died. His son completed the great project in 1571.

Plate 18. Humayun's tomb, Delhi

Today the tomb complex is entered by a large gate on the west, although in Mughal times the southern gate was widely used. Upon entering any gate, the centrally situated tomb and its *char bagh* setting are visible. Each of the four garden plots is further sub-divided by narrower waterways. Based on the *char bagh* types established in Iran and more fully developed in Babur's own concept of the ideal garden, such formalized and geometrically planned garden settings became standard for all the imperial Mughal mausolea and for those of many nobles as well. *Char bagh* gardens long had been associated with paradisical imagery. But at Humayun's tomb, the association is all the more explicit, for the water channels appear to vanish beneath the actual mausoleum yet reappear in their same straight course on the opposite side. This evokes a Quranic verse which describes rivers flowing beneath gardens of paradise.

The mausoleum is square in plan, 45 meters on a side. Crowned with a white marble bulbous dome and flanking *chattris,* the tomb sits on a high elevated plinth 99 meters per side. Each facade, faced with red sandstone and trimmed with white marble, is nearly identical and meets at chamferred corners. The west, north and east facades are marked by a high central portal flanked on either side by lower wings with deeply recessed niches. The south entrance, probably the main one, consists of lower wings on either side of a high central *pishtaq,* underneath which is a deeply recessed niche.

The seeming simplicity of this tomb's exterior is belied by the interior.

There, on the ground floor, the mausoleum has a central octagonal chamber containing a cenotaph. This chamber is surrounded by eight ancillary rooms, a radical departure from the single chamber of earlier Indian tombs. Passages connect these smaller chambers with the main one and with the outside. The second story of the tomb is similar. Such a spatial arrangement is based on geometric principles first applied in Timurid architecture and seen in structures such as the cIshrat Khana built about 1464 and used as a dynastic mausoleum for women.

These eight ancillary chambers are intended to evoke the paradises of Islamic cosmology. The passages connecting them are probably intended to facilitate circumambulation of the cenotaph in the central chamber. This ritual, drawn from sufic rites, was a common practice at Mughal imperial tombs.

The tomb's adherence to geometric principle and the complexity of its internal organization bear a clear imprint of Timurid tradition. This is not surprising since the architect himself had worked extensively in Bukhara, the last bastion of Timurid artistic traditions. Coupled with the fact that Humayun and his wife had long been exiled in Iran and developed a taste for an Iranian aesthetic, this easily explains the tomb's appearance. Moreover, the Mughals were extremely proud of their Timurid ancestry, and it is not without significance that this Timurid-inspired tomb and setting continued for the most part to serve as an important model for imperial tombs.

Some believe that Humayun's tomb was conceived as a Mughal dynastic mausoleum in the tradition of the great Timurid dynastic mausolea, for example, the Gur-i Amir in Samarqand.7 It was, however, not used as the tomb for subsequent rulers, although some members of the royal house were buried there. In 1565, only three years after its commencement, Akbar began construction on his massive Agra fort and moved his administration there.

Moving the imperial headquarters from Delhi did not signal its abandonment by either the emperor or highly influential court members. For example, Akbar in 1571 visited his father's tomb upon its completion and in 1572-73 gave orders for the restoration of the Jamac at Khana mosque at the Nizam al-Din *dargah.* In 1575-76, Akbar's chief theologian *(sadr),* Shaikh cAbd al-Nabi Khan, who wielded tremendous power until his fall from favor about 1580, constructed a mosque not in Agra or Fatehpur Sikri, then imperial residences, but in Delhi, suggesting that the city still was envisioned as a major urban center. This mosque, situated north of the Mughal Din-Panah, closely resembled Maham Anga's madrasa, although today few of its original features remain. The structure's epigraph, composed by Akbar's poet laureate, Faizi, the brother of Abu al-Fazl, does not specifically identify the structure's

function, but its close adherence to the earlier madrasa suggests that it was intended as a theological school, indicating Delhi's continuing role as an intellectual center.

# *Imperial forts and the formulation ofAkbar's taste*

While Humayun's Timurid-inspired tomb was still under construction, Akbar commenced a series of fort-palaces in a very different style at strategic locations across north India. The first of these was his great fort at Agra, which he commenced in 1565 and completed around 1571. Others that followed include

![](_page_9_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 20. Akbar's palace, Ajmer

Ajmer, the gate to Rajasthan, in 1570, and Lahore, traditionally guarding the northwestern portion of the subcontinent, in 1575. Later, in 1583, Akbar built a fort at Allahabad, situated east of Agra in the fertile Gangetic plain, a response to widespread uprisings throughout eastern India two years earlier. Beside these is his palace at Fatehpur Sikri, the most renowned of his capitals, although not a fortified one.

Few Akbari structures remain within most of these forts. In Ajmer, two Akbar-period palaces remain, each stone constructed. One is a trabeated structure today known as the Badshahi Mahal. Better known is a small palace, today used as a museum (Plate 20). There a nine-bayed pillared pavilion is enclosed within a fortified appearing quadrangle. In the Lahore fort Akbar's structures were replaced by subsequent rulers, and in the Allahabad fort, today still used as a major military headquarters, only one of the Akbari structures remains well-preserved. This is a *baradari* (pillared pavilion) situated in the center of a courtyard. The first floor of this three-stoned pillared structure bears a large central chamber surrounded by eight ancillary ones and an encompassing veranda. Buildings of such design had been used earlier at the Fatehpur Sikri palace, and appear to have been specifically intended for imperial use.<sup>8</sup>

Plate 21. Jahangiri Mahal, Agra fort, Agra

Abu al-Fazl states that more than 500 stone buildings were constructed in the Agra fort's interior.<sup>9</sup> While that number may be exaggerated, all the same, very few buildings remain. The fort was commenced in 1565 and completed in eight years under the direction of Qasim Khan Mir Barr o Bahr. It was intended to replace an older brick fort, so Akbar directed Qasim Khan to construct a stone fortification that would have unprecedented strength. The plan of the buttressed and crenellated walls, 22 meters high, roughly resembles a semicircle about 2.5 km in circumference. According to contemporary sources, thousands of workers, many of them stone masons, were employed on the project. The red sandstone facing inlaid with white marble detail gives a sense of majesty to the massive Delhi gate, the fort's main entrance. The fort's entire exterior, constructed with finer materials and crafted more meticulously than any other Indian fort, including Humayun's Din-Panah, imparts an awesome sense of the patron's power. It was the role of architecture to impress, according to traditional Islamic views of statecraft, and here Akbar succeeded immeasurably. That was his intention, as his biographer, Abu al-Fazl, makes clear.<sup>10</sup>

Within the fort the so-called Jahangiri Mahal (Plate 21) is the most notable

<sup>9</sup> Ain, II: 191. <sup>10</sup> Ain, I: 191.

remaining building of Akbar's time. Overlooking the river, this palace was probably one of a series that originally lined the waterfront. Palaces closest to the water in later periods are reserved for the king and his chief queens. This is probably the case here, too. However, the use of particular rooms and courtyards remains elusive, and indeed spaces that could serve multiple functions appear to have been typical in Akbar's palace architecture.

In plan and elevation the exterior of this Jahangiri Mahal closely resembles the so-called Jodh Bai's palace at Fatehpur Sikri or what remains of the small fortified appearing enclosure at Akbar's Ajmer palace. The main fabric of the exterior is intricately carved red sandstone trimmed with white marble. The heavily carved surfaces recall the Khalji-inspired Qal<sup>c</sup> a-i Kuhna mosque or pre-Mughal monuments from Kanauj and Bari. The main entrance of the edifice opens onto a large central courtyard flanked on its north and south sides by pillared halls, whose red sandstone bracketed supports are even more intricate versions of the sort of brackets seen on the Qal<sup>c</sup> a-i Kuhna mosque (Plate 5). The interior walls, too, are ornately carved. Abu al-Fazl comments that the red sandstone, quarried in the ridge of Fatehpur Sikri, hence known as Sikri sandstone, can be chiseled so skillfully that it is superior to wood.<sup>11</sup> Indeed, the brackets of the Jahangiri Mahal have wooden prototypes, but they appear earlier in stone on Man Singh Tomar's Gwalior palace, built at the turn of the sixteenth century. Both the layout and many of the motifs used on this earlier palace, much admired by the Mughals, appear instrumental in the design of this Agra palace and others built under Akbar's auspices.

Typical of several Islamic palaces in Central Asia, the Jahangiri Mahal's interior is symmetrically arranged around a central courtyard; a second courtyard on the east overlooks the river. A number of ancillary chambers and passages lead off from the central courtyard. Among these on the north is a large chamber with a flat roof supported by serpentine brackets. The source for such brackets is usually cited as Gujarat, especially Hindu or Jain architecture there. But such brackets long had been used in the Sultanate architecture of Gujarat and Bengal as well as at the Gwalior palace.

On the roof of this multi-storied building is a small rectangular pavilion with a veranda on three of its sides, whose exquisitely carved brackets in the shape of peacocks earlier appeared on the Gwalior palace. The attention to all stories, not just the ground floor, underscores the extraordinary quality of this palace. It was one of the few Akbari buildings in this fort that Shah Jahan maintained.

Aspects of this palace, especially the carved geometric patterns and even its trabeated form, may draw from the Timurid tradition. But its overall appearance reflects the form of domestic architecture, both Hindu and Muslim, popular across north India prior to Akbar's time. For example, trabeated

> 11  *Ain,* 1: 233.

#### AKBAR'S PATRONAGE

structures, the most common type in all Akbari palaces, were used for the palaces of the sultans of Chanderi. And residential structures in fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century paintings executed for both Hindu and Muslim patrons across north India were depicted as flat-roofed, not arcuated.<sup>12</sup> While Akbar's trabeated palaces may have Timurid origins, contemporary writers recognized their form as Indian. For example, Abu al-Fazl indicates a pan-Indian secular basis for Akbar's buildings in the Agra fort. He remarks that the Agra fort was built in the "fine styles of Bengal and Gujarat,"<sup>13</sup> commonly taken to indicate that Akbar based his palaces on Hindu buildings from Bengal and Gujarat. Akbar's architecture, however, was not based on any particular sectarian form. While some features of Akbar's buildings may be Bengali in origin or explicitly Guiarati, most of these motifs are found widely. Therefore, Abu al-Fazl's statement may be taken more on a figurative level than a literal one. That is, the architecture of Bengal and Gujarat was considered the most exquisite of the age, as we can tell from Babur's enthusiasm for the edifices of Chanderi built in the Gujarati style and Humayun's love for the palaces of Gujarat and Bengal. Thus "the fine styles of Bengal and Gujarat" is probably a metaphor for that which was deemed the ultimate in architectural perfection. Moreover, as Bengal and Gujarat at the time that Abu al-Fazl was writing essentially marked the eastern and western boundaries of the Indian subcontinent, he may have been alluding to styles that found favor throughout north India and symbolically were brought together with the construction of Akbar's palace-fort in Agra, which he terms "the center of Hindustan."<sup>14</sup>

# The new capital at Fatehpur Sikri

Akbar remained heirless until 1569 when his son, the future Jahangir, was born in the village of Sikri, 38 km west of Agra. That year Akbar commenced construction there of the religious compound as a sign of his esteem for the Chishti saint, Shaikh Salim, his spiritual adviser who had predicted the birth of his son. After Jahangir's second birthday, probably considered an adequate period to test his stamina since all the emperor's other offspring had died in infancy, Akbar commenced construction at Sikri of a walled city and imperial palace. He shifted his capital from Agra to this city, which came to be called Fatehpur Sikri. Just as Humayun's tomb earlier had been placed close to the Chishti *dargah*, Nizam al-Din, so Akbar situated his palace at a Chishti site. By constructing his capital at the khangah of his spiritual adviser, Akbar associated himself with this popular sufi order and so brought further

legitimacy to his reign through affiliation with popular yet orthodox Islam.<sup>15</sup>

The city is surrounded by about 11 km of walls except on the south, where there was a lake. Situated atop a rocky ridge (about 3 km in length and 1 km wide), the royal enclave, consisting of the Chishti khangah and palace, form the focal point of the city and the best preserved area (Plate 22). The numerous structures comprising this area are made from locally quarried red sandstone, known as Sikri sandstone. Although the site has been carefully studied, the identification and original purpose of many buildings there remain in question. The names they bear today were invented, largely for the benefit of nineteenthcentury European visitors to the site. Probably, in fact, the buildings had no single purpose, in keeping with Islamic tradition, but were adaptable to serve many functions. This matches well with Akbar's fluid and spontaneous approach to court ceremony.<sup>16</sup>

Akbar's orders for the construction of this great city included nobles' dwellings, a great mosque, imperial palaces, baths, serais, a bazaar, gardens, schools, a *khangah* and workshops. Thus Fatehpur Sikri was more than a royal residence; it had an economic, administrative and residential base. Contemporary accounts stress that the city was finished quickly. Work was ceaseless. One European visitor stated that because the work was done a short distance away and then assembled at the site, the inhabitants were spared from the stone masons' constant noise.<sup>17</sup> The city, however, was only inhabited by Akbar for about fifteen years. Then in 1585 he assumed residence in Lahore to be closer to the less stable part of his empire.

Situated on the highest place on the ridge, the *khangah* is the site's focal point. Within this religious compound, 111 by 139 meters, is an enormous Jamic mosque (Plate 25), its cloistered enclosure walls, three entrance gates, and the tomb of Shaikh Salim Chishti (Plate 26). Beneath the courtyard are underground reservoirs, an important consideration for a site which suffers from a poor water supply.

The Buland Darwaza (Plate 23), the complex's towering south entrance gate, 54 meters in height, is visible from a considerable distance. This enormous gate was almost certainly constructed concurrently with the mosque complex. While commonly believed that it was not erected until the early seventeenth century, this gate was certainly designed before 1587, when the calligrapher Ahmad al-Chishti, responsible for its monumental Quranic inscriptions, died. The gate was probably built to commemorate Akbar's successful Gujarat

campaign in 1573, when Sikri came to be known as Fatehpur Sikri, the City of Victory.<sup>18</sup> This monumental gate, however, was probably less intended to commemorate a military victory than to underscore Akbar's links with the Chishti order. Its surface is covered by marble slabs inscribed with Ouranic verses promising paradise to true believers, appropriate for the entrance into a *khangah*, a complex intended for meditation and devotion.

The Jamic mosque (Plates  $24-25$ ) is situated on the west side of the complex so that it can face Mecca as required in Islam. An inscription on the mosque's east facade states that it was built in 1571-72 by Shaikh Salim himself, while interior inscriptions are dated 1574, indicating its completion. Textual

Plate 23. Buland Darwaza, Fatehpur Sikri

references also verify that the mosque was finished about this time.<sup>19</sup> Measuring 89 by 20 meters, the mosque was at that time the largest in the Mughal empire. The exterior is marked by a high central *pishtaq* flanked on either side by delicately arched side wings. In addition to domes a row of small *chattris* crown the entire eastern edge of the roof. The mosque's multiple arched openings resting on slender pillars recall pre-Mughal Jami<sup>c</sup> mosques at Chanderi and Mandu. The superstructure also appears to be modeled on the type seen in the Mandu Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque; however, at Fatehpur Sikri, *chattris* are used in lieu of smaller domes. Thus much of the facade's overall appearance derives from an older pre-Mughal Indian tradition, but the high central *pishtaq* is characteristic of all Mughal Jamic mosques and can be considered a Mughal interpretation of an older Timurid architectural device. Here the Timurid origins of this *pishtaq* are more apparent than on Babur's or Humayun's mosques, for, like Timurid portals, the recessed portion above the arched entrance is vaulted.

Plate 24. Jamic mosque, Fatehpur Sikri

The mosque's interior central bay is a vastly more sophisticated rendition of the type found in the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosques built under Humayun and Babur. Behind the central *pishtaq* is the mosque's main prayer chamber magnificently embellished with white marble inlaid into the red stone to form intricate geometric patterns. Painted arabesques and floral motifs are rendered in polychrome and gilt, creating the most impressive Mughal monument of its time. While such patterns were known in the late Lodi and Sur times in India, the sophistication and intricacy of the motifs suggest an awareness of Timurid prototypes.

Side wings flank the mosque's central bay. Each is composed of multi-aisled trabeated bays and a double-aisled pillared veranda. The elegant slender red sandstone pillars of the side wings are surmounted by brackets similar to those on Akbar's Jahangiri Mahal in his Agra fort. This mosque is a unique blend of long-established Indian and Timurid techniques.

Akbar himself is said to have humbly swept the floor and called the prayer in this mosque. Yet, ironically, some of Akbar's acts here alienated the orthodox *culema,* the Islamic scholars and jurists who traditionally have ultimate authority over matters religious. Here in 1579 he himself read the *khutba,* the prayer legitimizing an Islamic ruler's sovereignty. Although this had been done by his Timurid ancestors, in India the  *culema* interpreted this as an attempt by Akbar to declare himself the arbitrator of religious affairs and thus a radical move. Then two months later Akbar issued the declaration *(mabzar)* which assigned to himself limited power in deciding religious matters. This declaration was approved unwillingly by the leading religious arbitrators and further alienated the orthodox *culema.* In fact, the *mahzar* was more a political document than a religious one, for it allowed Akbar control over secular and administrative affairs; his authority over religious matters was limited to instances when the leading religious figures failed to agree.

Shaikh Salim, Akbar's spiritual adviser who had predicted the birth of his son, died in 1572. His tomb (Plate 26) was completed almost a decade later, in 15 80-81, as indicated by inscriptions on its inner walls, even though it probably was commenced much earlier. This white marble single-domed building measuring 15 meters square is rightfully considered a masterpiece. The interior square chamber is surrounded by an enclosed corridor to facilitate circumambulation of the tomb. This tomb-type was known earlier in Gujarat, the source of this plan. The outer walls are composed of intricately carved white marble screens *(jalis).* Although less intricate, pierced screens are on the exterior of Shaikh Ahmad Khattu's tomb at Sarkhej, Gujarat's premier shrine. Exquisitely carved serpentine brackets belonging to the Indo-Islamic architectural traditions of Mandu, Chanderi and Gujarat support deep eaves *(cbajja)* that encircle the entire tomb and its projecting south entrance porch. These screens and the multi-colored stone flooring, similar to that at Sarkhej, were donated by a noble, Qutb al-Din Muhammad Khan, at his own expense; he had served in Gujarat and was buried in Baroda in 1583.20

Artisans trained in Gujarat and brought to Fatehpur Sikri by Qutb al-Din Muhammad Khan worked on Shaikh Salim's tomb. However, the features derived from the tomb of Shaikh Ahmad Khattu may have been used intentionally, for this shrine had been built by the sultans of Gujarat, and like the

Plate 26. Tomb of Shaikh Salim Chishti, Fatehpur Sikn

shrine of Shaikh Salim Chishti at Fatehpur Sikri was at the site of their palace. Hence the sultans of Gujarat are linked with Shaikh Ahmad Khattu, much as Akbar sought to link his rule with the Chishti saint.

Akbar's association with the Chishti saint explains the reason behind the tomb's extraordinary workmanship. Even its fabric, white marble, links it with the Chishti order. Twenty years earlier the tomb of the Chishti saint Nizam al-Din in Delhi had been renewed in white marble. It is ironic, however, that Shaikh Salim's tomb was not completed until Akbar began to break with the Chishti, in fact, with all saint veneration. After 1579, Akbar no longer made his annual pilgrimage on foot to the shrine of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din Chishti. Stopping this practice of long standing, he stated that saint worship was a shallow preoccupation, not a profound religious one.

Akbar probably commenced the tomb as a means of exerting authority over this popular Islamic order. He also denied the shaikh's descendants hereditary custodianship of the tomb, by now a popular site of pilgrimage. Instead, Akbar himself appointed the shrine's supervisor. The emperor had assumed similar control over the premier *dargah* of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din Chishti in Ajmer in 1570,

when he resolved a dispute regarding the shrine's successorship by appointing his own candidate. Thus, at both important Chishti sites, Akbar himself held the reins on matters elsewhere left to a saint's spiritual heirs. Chishti descendants, instead of serving these *dargahs*, were encouraged to enter imperial service, suggesting that Akbar's association with this mystic order served himself in political ways as well as spiritual ones.<sup>21</sup>

Akbar's palace complex at Fatehpur Sikri lies to the southeast of the mosque. This complex was clearly planned, for the palace buildings are axially and geometrically related to the *khangah*.<sup>22</sup> Abu al-Fazl described Akbar's architects and designers as "lofty-minded mathematicians";<sup>23</sup> even the emperor, one chronicler stated, had a "geometry decoding mind,"<sup>24</sup> and his architecture was described by the court biographer as understandable to "the minds of the mathematical."<sup>25</sup> Geometry here serves as a metaphor for Akbar's control and power.<sup>26</sup>

The Hathiya Pol, or Elephant gate, situated at the southern end of the palace complex, was probably the imperial entrance.<sup>27</sup> Here there was a *naqqar khana*, or chamber where ceremonial drums were played.<sup>28</sup> The view toward this southern entrance is imposing, almost as spectacular as that toward the powerful Buland Darwaza on the north. In front of the Hathiya Pol is a large serai. Beyond the gate, the *chattris* and roofs of the palaces are visible. Once one enters the gate, there is access to both the mosque complex (Plate  $25$ ) and the palace structures, including the Daulat Khana-i Khass o cAmm, or Public Audience Hall (Plate 28), one of the most important administrative units.

All Indian forts have an entrance associated with elephants. They probably were intended for the entry of palanguined elephants, in India long considered the imperial mount. For Akbar, moreover, elephants appear to have had a special importance. His reverence for these animals is discussed by Abu al-Fazl, who notes that they can only be controlled by wise and intelligent men. In the illustrated Akbar Nama in the Victoria and Albert Museum, generally believed to have been Akbar's personal copy, elephants are frequently depicted, and on several pages there are illustrations of Akbar controlling mad elephants elephants that no other mortal could ride. As the emperor indicated to Abu

al-Fazl, successfully riding such a beast without being killed should be taken as a sign of God's contentment with him.29

At the foot of the rampart leading to the Hathiya Pol is a minaret spiked with stone projections resembling elephant tusks (Plate 27). Popularly known as the Hiran Minar and considered a hunting tower, it is not mentioned in any contemporary text. This tower, derived from Iranian prototypes, was probably used to indicate the starting point for subsequent mile posts *(kos minar).i0* In Mughal India, such mile posts were conical-shaped smooth-faced minarets; many remain between Agra and Delhi as well as in other areas of northwestern India and Pakistan. The tusk-like shape of the protruding stones appears appropriate for this tower's location near the Elephant gate, and may be yet another reference to Akbar as controller of elephants and ultimately of the well-run state.

To the east of the Elephant gate is a large quadrangular courtyard known as

Plate 28. Akbar's throne, Public Audience Hall, Fatehpur Sikri

the Public Audience Hall. It is one of the few areas within the palace whose function is certain. The road leading from the city walls to this audience hall was lined with shops and markets that were commenced in  $1576-77$ . It is a focal point of the palace, a secular one complementing the mosque complex.<sup>31</sup> The rest of the palace lay between the mosque and audience hall, pivotal points which reflect Akbar's concerns with religion and the welfare of the state.

The structure enclosing the courtyard is simple given the nature of its importance, for here the emperor presented himself to all levels of the nobility and to others who wanted recourse to the king. This structure is essentially a pillared flat-roofed veranda, called an *aiwan*.<sup>32</sup> In the center of the west wall is a projection where Akbar sat enthroned (Plate 28). His subjects, when confronting him, faced the gibla or direction of prayer, perhaps suggesting the metaphor of Akbar as the qibla of the state.<sup>33</sup> This imperial chamber was even used as a mosque.

Due west of the Public Audience Hall is an area which appears to have been reserved for the emperor's private administrative and personal matters. Only a few structures in this area can be identified with much certainty. One of these is the Anup Talao, a square pool in whose center was a pavilion. Its base still

remains connected to each of the pool's four edges by stone planks. Here, Akbar engaged in serious discussion regarding Islamic law with leading Muslim theologians, as several contemporary writers describe. They also note that he filled this tank with gold coins and distributed them to shaikhs and

amirs. Surrounding the tank are trabeated structures, most of them a single story high. One, known as the Turkish Sultana's House, is completely covered with carvings of geometric patterns, trees, flowering vines, birds and animals. Although some of this ornamentation draws upon earlier Indian imagery, the decor of this palace, more than that of any other residential or civic structure here, is based on Timurid tradition.<sup>34</sup> The richly carved ornamentation (Plate 29) situated at floor level indicates that here inhabitants were intended to sit on silk and cotton cushions, not stand as in a public audience hall. The ceiling and walls, too, were often covered with luxurious fabrics. Thus we must recall that these buildings were not simply red sandstone, but decked, as contemporary accounts remind us, with rich textile trappings.

On the south edge of the Anup Talao is a multi-storied building,

34 Koch, "Architectural Forms," 141.

![](_page_23_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 30. Akbar's *iharoka*, exterior facade, Daftar Khana, Fatehpur Sikri

traditionally known as the Khwabgah, or Akbar's sleeping chamber. Its plain architectural members bear traces of figural painting and calligraphy, suggesting that structures not carved were polychromed. The painted verses make direct reference to Akbar, calling him "the adorner of the realm of Hindustan,"<sup>35</sup> and so suggesting that this palace was intended for imperial use. Further underscoring this is the plan of the top story, consisting of a central rectangular pavilion with a flat interior roof surrounded by a pillared veranda, a type identified at Akbar's Allahabad fort as one intended for imperial use.<sup>36</sup>

On the southernmost side of a courtyard aligned with the Khwabgah and immediately to its south is the so-called Daftar Khana, or records office (Plate 30). It consists of a small room with a large open window that overlooks the terrain below. This was Akbar's *iharoka*, the window at which daily he displayed himself to his subjects.<sup>37</sup> Although this ritual was derived from a custom of Hindu kings, the Mughals earlier had adopted it. For example, after Humayun's death, a man resembling the deceased ruler was displayed at a similar window in the Delhi citadel until the young Prince Akbar could be crowned. Such regular appearances reassured the population that all was well in the state.

Of all the buildings at Fatehpur Sikri, a small square building commonly known as the Diwan-i Khass (Plate 31) has been the subject of greatest speculation. Its location, situated just behind the Public Audience Hall and aligned with the jharoka, indicates that this was the Private Audience Hall. The

Plate 31. Diwan-i Khass, Fatehpur Sikri

exterior fits well with the other trabeated palace pavilions at Fatehpur Sikri. Its interior, however, is unique. There in the center of the building's single chamber is an elaborately carved faceted pillar reaching about half of the building's total height (Plate 32). Its capital is composed of serpentine brackets, reminiscent of those appearing in the Sultanate architecture of Gujarat, Mandu and Lodi Delhi. These brackets, fuller at the top than at the bottom, support a circular platform. It is connected to each corner of the building by stone slab walkways attached to the building's corners. A narrow path circumscribes the structure connecting the walkways.

Akbar probably sat upon this central platform. Thus some believe that here he projected himself as a *chakravartin,* or universal ruler, following the indigenous Indian notions of kingship;<sup>38</sup> however, since Akbar's deep interest in Hinduism and other non-Islamic traditions developed after much of Fatehpur Sikri was well under construction, this theory must be viewed as tentative. More likely, Akbar sat on this central platform to project himself as the dominant figure in the Mughal state, its axis and the pillar of its support.

Plate 33. Panch Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri

West of this area is a number of small palace complexes. Nearly all of them are multi-storied trabeated buildings. Often they are assumed to be the residences of Akbar's queens and nobles. More probably they housed only princes and women of the household, for all of them were linked to the Khwabgah, or imperial chamber, by covered screened passageways.

The tallest of these is the so-called Panch Mahal (Plate 33). The name derives from its five tiers, the final one consisting of a large single *chattri.* Suggestions that this was a pleasure pavilion are stimulated by its elevation and design, assumed to take advantage of cooling breezes. Because this tall building provided a view of the areas reserved for the emperor and the royal household, only the most trusted would have had access to it. Pierced stone screens faced the facade and probably sub-divided the interior as well, suggesting that it was used by the women of the imperial harem.

The largest among these small palace complexes is today called Jodh Bai's palace. This may have been the first palace constructed at Fatehpur Sikri since it leads most directly, via a passage that once was covered, to the Hathiya Pol. This palace's scale has prompted suggestions that it was the principal residence of Akbar's harem. The building, enclosing a square courtyard, is entered by an arched gate recalling the one at Akbar's Ajmer palace. The rooms of the

interior are trabeated. Their carved ornamentation derives more than that of any other palace from the traditions of Gujarat. The sinuous brackets atop recessed niches on the palace's interior recall similar ornamentation on both mosques and Hindu temples of Gujarat. Likewise, the hanging chain-and-bell motif carved on many of the pillars has precedents in the Hindu and Muslim architecture of pre-Mughal Gujarat and Bengal.

The so-called House of Raja Birbal, one of Akbar's principal courtiers, is inscribed with a date corresponding to 1572. A phrase following this date, "royal mansion of initiation,"<sup>39</sup> suggests that its purpose was not residential, but ceremonial or even administrative. It emphasizes how little we know about the function of Fatehpur Sikri's buildings.

The carved ornamentation of this palace, like that of most of the others, is deeply rooted in the decor of both Hindu and Muslim Indian architecture. For example, the palace's frequent *chandrashala* motifs were long used in pre-Islamic Indian architecture, as well as on Sultanate buildings. The ornate brackets, too, while much earlier seen on Hindu buildings, long had been incorporated into the basic vocabulary of Sultanate architecture. Buildings that would appeal to both Hindus and Muslims were important since these forts and palaces were recognized as vital in the maintenance of Akbar's wellbalanced state.<sup>40</sup>

Akbar's choice of a style that appealed to all subjects regardless of sectarian affiliation is better understood if we consider certain imperial policies promulgated while Fatehpur Sikri and the Agra and Ajmer forts were built. Abu al-Fazl clearly indicates that Akbar, adhering to well-established Perso-Islamic concepts of sovereignty, believed that the ultimate justification for the Mughal empire was the propagation of justice. Under Akbar, Abu al-Fazl reports, the canopy of justice was extended officially to all subjects regardless of religious affiliation. This is his policy of *sulh-i kul,* or universal toleration. The policy was evolving at the very time Fatehpur Sikri was under construction. In other words, the inclusion of styles appropriate to all groups of the nobility - that is, the political strength of the empire - was truly in keeping with Akbar's nascent policy of universal toleration.

In the early 1560s, prior to the construction of his palaces, Akbar instituted liberal treatment of Hindus, for example, forbidding the forced conversion of prisoners to Islam and renouncing the *jiziya,* the tax on non-Muslims. Political, not personal, considerations probably stimulated these measures and suggested the styles adopted for his palaces. It was not until much later, in the 1580s and 1590s, that Akbar began personally to adopt indigenous Indian customs and practices.

However, when these palaces were erected, Akbar equally was as concerned

39  *Sourcebook,* p. 258. 40  *Ain,1:1)2.*

with winning over the sympathy of the orthodox Indian Muslims. For example, the reorganization of the Sadarat (chief religious and legal office) probably was aimed specifically at gaining favor with the Indian Muslims, a group that in the previous Mughal rulers' administration held no power. Akbar's goal in doing this was to reduce the influence of the dominant Iranian nobles, that is, Central Asian and Persian nobles, by including Indian Muslims and even Hindus in his administration. In other words, what we see in these nascent stages of Akbar's policy of *sulh-i kul* is an attempt to place the indigenous elements of Indian society, be they Hindu or Muslim, on an equal footing with the traditionally more favored and powerful Central Asian and Persian nobility.<sup>41</sup>

#### SUB-IMPERIAL PATRONAGE

Once Akbar left Fatehpur Sikri, he built little. In the emperor's stead, his amirs served as architectural patrons, particularly in the developing Mughal hinterlands. Some nobles had provided buildings long before Akbar's departure from Fatehpur Sikri, in part to gain imperial favor. But especially in the later phases of Akbar's reign, patronage by nobles became increasingly significant. Much of this reflected the complex relationship between the emperor and his nobility. While the Mughal emperor was the highest authority, his power depended on carefully balanced and constantly fluctuating relationships with his own nobles and local rulers, be they Hindu or Muslim. By extension, these non-imperial works often aided the spread of styles favored by the center.

# Raja Man Singh, Hindu patron and Mughal agent

Raja Man Singh was a Hindu in the court of the Muslim Akbar and one of his highest ranking amirs. Although his landholdings shifted as his appointments changed, he was a prince with stable ancestral lands (*watan jagir*) as well. The buildings that he constructed on these lands provide insight into the relationship between the emperor and his nobles as well as into the extension of Mughal architecture in the hinterlands.<sup>42</sup>

Raja Man Singh's prolific patronage throughout the Mughal domain may in part reflect his special status. His family, the Kachhwahas, was the first princely house of Rajasthan to join the Mughal ranks and give their daughters in marriage to Mughal princes and emperors. As a result, Man Singh and his

tecture of Raja Man Singh," in Barbara S. Miller (ed.), Powers of Art: Patronage in Indian Culture (New Delhi, 1992), pp. 183-201.

father, Raja Bhagwant Das, were constant companions of Akbar. Akbar developed deep affection for Man Singh. As prince, Man Singh served Akbar well, leading major military campaigns. In 1589, after the death of Man Singh's father, Akbar awarded Man Singh the title raja as well as the highest rank *(mansab)* awarded at that time.

Raja Man Singh's architecture includes palaces and gardens, temples and even mosques. Among temples are the Govind Deva temple in Brindavan (Plate 34), not far from Agra, and the Jagat Shiromani temple in Amber (Plate 35), the seat of Raja Man Singh's ancestral land. Inscriptions on the Govind Deva temple, dated 1590, suggest it was built to commemorate his recently deceased father. The Jagat Shiromani temple, too, was built to honor a recently deceased relative, Raja Man Singh's eldest son and heir apparent who died in 1599. Other temples he built also memorialized recently deceased family members.

Raja Man Singh's temples reflect contemporary Mughal taste. The Govind Deva temple (Plate 34), nearly 80 meters in length, is by far the largest temple constructed in north India since the thirteenth century. In plan, the temple is cruciform, recalling many similar temple plans. Continuous horizontal moldings cover the entire elevation of the temple's exterior, broken only by pillared apertures on the ground floor and bracketed and pillared oriel windows on the upper level. The aniconic nature of the temple's exterior is in keeping with others, such as his father's slightly earlier temple at nearby Govardhan. While the Govind Deva temple's Sikri sandstone exterior, particularly in its brackets and pillars, reflects pan-Indian trends, its arcuated, vaulted and domed interior corridors flanked by elaborate bracketed pillars are very specifically Mughal in appearance.

Temples exhibiting features commonly associated with Muslim constructed architecture did not originate with Man Singh. For example, temples with domes are depicted in paintings executed about 1570, such as those illustrating the *Tuti Nama.* On Man Singh's Govind Deva temple, however, net pendentives, domes and lengthy barrel-vaults are used to create a sense of open longitudinal and vertical space unprecedented in Akbari architecture. Thus the Govind Deva temple does not merely reflect existing Mughal building, but in many ways anticipates trends yet to develop in imperial Mughal architecture. The Jagat Shiromani temple in Amber (Plate 35), built about a decade later, is based on artistic traditions established in Akbar's capital, Fatehpur Sikri; it is even more ornate than buildings of the capital. In this manner, Raja Man Singh can be said to be an innovator of Mughal taste, not simply an imitator.

Raja Man Singh, one of Akbar's most successful administrators, governed first the province *(suba)* of Bihar and then Bengal from 1578 through the early years of Jahangir's reign, a period of nearly twenty years. In the hill fort of Rohtas and at Rajmahal, Raja Man Singh's capitals respectively of Bihar and Bengal, he provided buildings that furthered his own image yet represented

![](_page_30_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 34. Govind Deva temple, Brindavan

Mughal presence. At Rohtas, Man Singh built by far the most impressive palace for any governor in the Mughal empire. It was also the largest non-imperial palace in the entire Mughal empire.

Man Singh's palace, completed in 1596 according to an inscription over the main entrance, served both himself and the Mughal empire. The palace, measuring 200 by 18 5 meters, is modeled closely on the plan of Fatehpur Sikri. Like the Fatehpur Sikri palace (Plate 22), Man Singh's palace at Rohtas can be divided into administrative and domestic sections. The domestic portions included *hammams,* latrines and residential quarters for Man Singh and his zenana. The administrative section had areas intended for public and private purposes. The public area included a viewing window for public audience *(jharoka)* (Plate 36) that faces an open quadrangle. This quadrangle for public audience is a large rectangular area in front of the palace that until now has been identified as a serai. An elaborate set of buildings, including one traditionally called a *baradari,* were probably in the private administrative area of the palace. Also in this area is a building known as the Private Audience Hall, situated just behind the public viewing balcony. Both a Public and Private Audience Hall were necessary so that a governor could enact the sort of court ritual that was maintained at the distant imperial seat.

Not only does the Rohtas palace recall the general plan and arrangement of Fatehpur Sikri, but also the style of the palace is very much in keeping with

![](_page_31_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 35. Jagat Shiromani temple, Amber

imperial Mughal architecture. The carved brackets on the Private Audience Hall, for example, recall those of several buildings at Fatehpur Sikri (Plates 28 and 31), and the arcuated forms of the Shish Mahal, part of the zenana, resemble those of the Fatehpur Sikri *hammams.* In these ways and others, the palace is the first structure to introduce the courtly style of architecture to eastern India. Man Singh's palace thus provides a powerful statement of Mughal presence, especially effective in showing Mughal authority over local recalcitrant zamindars, whose forts were crudely constructed.

This imposing site projected more than an image of Mughal presence. It also projected that of Man Singh himself. He was fully aware of his dual role as Mughal governor and rank holder *{mansabdar)* on one hand and as raja or prince in his own right. This we may glean from a large stone slab at the palace

![](_page_32_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate *}6.Jharoka,* Rohtas palace, Rohtas

entrance gate. It bears two inscriptions, one in Persian and one in Sanskrit. The one in Persian suggests that Raja Man Singh primarily built the palace as a servant of Akbar, for it first and most extensively addresses the emperor Akbar with only brief reference to Raja Man Singh, the actual patron. But in the longer Sanskrit inscription on the same slab, Akbar's name is omitted altogether. Instead the raja is mentioned twice, once even as king of kings, overlord, suggesting that he, the governor, was supreme monarch.

The grandiloquent title on a palace intended to serve both the governor's needs as well as those of the state underscores the dual nature of the relationship between the raja and the Mughal emperor. Under the Mughal state system, serving the emperor included defending one's own religion, honor and even patrimony if necessary.<sup>43</sup> Thus evoking a title which may have symbolized Rajput ideals and aspirations in itself did not conflict with Man Singh's role as Akbar's governor, for both were part of the integral success of the functioning Mughal empire. Similarly, the resemblance of the Rohtas palace to Fatehpur Sikri both recalls the emperor and permits Man Singh to assume the guise of the ruler that in fact he was. He thus played out his dual role as the emperor's agent

> 43 Richards, "Imperial Authority," 275.

and raja in his own right, a duality characteristic of the relationship between Akbar and his lesser authorities.

Even after Man Singh was transferred from the governorship of Bihar he continued to hold Rohtas and maintained his building program there. Thus his tenure over Rohtas lasted nearly twenty years, a remarkable span when most *jagirs* were changed every few years so that a power base could not be established. Man Singh's long-term tenure at Rohtas reflected his willingness to invest personal resources in a palace that far surpassed that of any other Mughal governor.

After rapidly consolidating Mughal authority in Bihar, Raja Man Singh was transferred to Bengal in 1594 to assume the governorship there. Akbar hoped that Man Singh's success in subduing rebels in Bihar might be repeated against the rebel Afghans, such as the Qaqshal, and zamindars who continued to challenge Mughal authority in Bengal. In 1595 Man Singh built a new capital at a site known today as Rajmahal. The selection of this site for the capital of Bengal had significance, since here Akbar's army in 1576 had defeated the last legitimate Afghan ruler of Bengal, ending over 200 years of independent rule there. Thus the site of Mughal victory - and Afghan defeat - was memorialized by a permanent Mughal presence and, as if taking power from victory, the seat of its government.

Abu al-Fazl reports that in a short time Raja Man Singh constructed "a choice city" to which the "glorious name" Akbarnagar was given.44 However, this name was not so harmoniously bestowed, for originally Man Singh had named it Rajanagar, after himself and in recognition of his own patronage. Later, however, he acceded to Akbar's objection and called it Akbarnagar.<sup>45</sup> This recalls the tension seen in the Rohtas palace inscriptions, suggesting that while the new capital was intended to serve the needs of the Mughal empire, the individuality of the governor, Raja Man Singh, was not to be sublimated in the process.

Among Man Singh's structures in Rajmahal are a small temple, a bridge and an enormous Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque (Plates 37 and 38). The construction of a temple and utilitarian bridge is not surprising; his patronage of a mosque, too, is not unusual, for earlier he had built a mosque in Lahore and since 1590 had maintained the shrine of a saint in Hajipur. But none of this would explain the tremendous size of the Rajmahal Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque, 77 by 65 meters.

This mosque, today partially ruined, is notably not designed in the style standard since the mid-sixteenth century in eastern India, that is, a single-aisled three-bayed type. Rather, in plan the Rajmahal Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque resembles earlier Mughal Jami<sup>c</sup> mosques, for example, Babur's mosque at Panipat (Plate 7). In

each, a central corridor is flanked on either side by multi-aisled side wings. Furthermore, the arrangement of the Rajmahal mosque's end chambers, otherwise unknown in Bengal, resembles that of Akbar's Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque at Fatehpur Sikri (Plate 24). Other features of the Rajmahal Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque also recall the Fatehpur Sikri Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque (Plate 25), although they are no longer apparent, but recognizable from an early nineteenth-century drawing. It indicates that the central barrel-vault was concealed by a high rectangular *pishtaq,* faced with bands of contrasting material, following the imperial model.

Thus this imposing mosque, built not in the Bengal tradition but that of the great Mughal Jami<sup>c</sup> mosques, was intended as a statement of Mughal presence in Bengal. Certainly in no other Mughal provincial seat of government during this period was such an extraordinarily large mosque built, especially remarkable in this case since Man Singh was a Hindu. In fact, local tradition holds that Raja Man Singh did not originally intend to construct a mosque, but a temple; Akbar, however, ordered that a mosque be built since such a structure would better suit the needs at hand. Man Singh seems to have accepted this order with enthusiasm, for the size of this mosque is unparalleled in the works of nonimperial patrons. Its size further may be explained by the chronic difficulties the Mughals had in subduing Bengal. Using the Rajmahal Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque as a symbol of imperial presence in the newly established capital doubtless would

have had effect since many of the rebels, themselves ex-Mughal amirs, would have recognized the allusion to the great mosque at Fatehpur Sikri.

Throughout Raja Man Singh's career, architectural patronage served varied and at times even seemingly conflicting purposes. Palaces such as the one at Rohtas were constructed for his own dwelling, administration and image, but inevitably they also represented Mughal presence and were built with this in mind. Similarly, the mosques this Hindu constructed to serve Muslim subjects represented a visual reminder of imperial presence. Temples were built as personal gestures in part to commemorate his family and in part to secure religious merit. It might be argued that the construction of temples elevated only the patron's prestige. Nevertheless, the temples, like most architecture provided by Akbar's nobles, utilized styles that originated with Akbar's court and in essence underscored Akbar's presence. These buildings further promulgated a uniform aesthetic throughout north India. Thus ultimately even the construction of temples served the state. Just as Akbar was the ultimate head of state whose authority was diffused through his nobles and others, so artistic and architectural styles used in the center were disseminated throughout the domain by these officials, both Hindu and Muslim. The degree of imperial intervention in construction remains unclear, but such enterprise certainly served the state and was valued by the emperor. This is apparent from the second of twelve orders issued upon the accession of Akbar's successor, Jahangir. It states that it is the duty *oi jagirdars* (amirs assigned land revenues in lieu of salary) to provide religious and secular buildings in the hinterlands to encourage population and stability throughout their domain.<sup>46</sup> This nobles such as Man Singh already had done - to such an extent and so successfully that his building activity may have stimulated the order.

No Mughal noble built as widely as did Man Singh. But others built, and did so with similar motivation. They, too, bolstered their status while at the same time serving the emperor and through their building activity extended the Mughal aesthetic into the provinces.

#### *Western India*

## *Nagaur*

Akbar realized that subjugation of the princely states in western India was in the Mughals' best interests. To do this, the Rajput princes had to be made Mughal vassals. First, Ajmer and Nagaur, part of the traditional area known as Marwar, fell to the Mughals shortly after Akbar's accession. Then major headway toward consolidation was achieved when Raja Baramal Kachhwaha of

Plate 38. Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque, Rajmahal

Amber, until recently the princely family of Jaipur, agreed to give his daughter in marriage to Akbar in 1562, commencing a long-standing relationship of mutual benefit between these families. By 1570, all the major princely states of Rajasthan, with the exception of Mewar, acknowledged the Mughals as overlord. At the same time, order had to be imposed even on some Mughal nobles. Such was the case with the landholder of Nagaur, Muhammad Sharaf al-Din Husain Mirza, who rebelled for reasons never fully explained. He was replaced in the same year, 1562, by Husain Ouli Khan, already a greatly trusted noble, who later was appointed governor of the Punjab and awarded the prestigious title Khan-i Jahan, or Noble of the World.

Husain Quli Khan built in areas where he was posted. His patronage of a mosque in front of the local raja's house in the Punjab is known only from texts.<sup>47</sup> His patronage of a mosque in Nagaur, locally called the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque, is confirmed by an inscription dated  $1564-65$ , some two years after his appointment there. This mosque suggests that structures patronized by the Mughal nobility in the early stages of Akbar's reign were constructed with some awareness of the imperial tradition, but largely in local idioms and, in all probability, by local artisans. The mosque, dominating Nagaur's numerous religious monuments, is a single-aisled three-bayed structure surmounted by a single central dome. Towering minarets flanking either end of the east facade make the structure visible for a considerable distance. While certain features, such as the mosque's plan and the deeply recessed tri-partite mihrab, reflect an awareness of architectural forms in contemporary Delhi, then the capital, the mosque draws heavily on the local architectural traditions of Marwar. For example, the facade recalls that of the fifteenth-century Shamsi mosque in Nagaur, and the stone canopied minbar inside this Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque (Plate 39) recalls those seen in the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosques of Mandu and Chanderi, but not on any imperially sponsored Mughal mosques.

The mosque's inscription suggests that the building was intended to represent Mughal authority. It is not on the facade where historical inscriptions are generally placed, but embedded into the gibla wall, within the minbar. Here the khutba was delivered, that is, the Friday prayer in which the ruling monarch's name was read. This inscription states that the mosque was constructed in the "reign of the ruler of the age, Akbar," and likens the building to "the qibla of deductions and principles."48 Thus Husain Quli Khan used the structure as well as the words of the inscription and its unique location to underscore the image Akbar had sought to project of himself: the qibla of the state. The inscription's verses were carved by Darwish Muhammad al-Hajji, whose pen

name was Ramzi; he executed several other inscriptions on monuments in this region.

#### *Ajmer*

Ajmer especially benefited from imperial interest and intervention. By 1579 Akbar had come on pilgrimage to the *dargah* of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din Chishti in Ajmer fourteen times. During this period, he repaired and enlarged the fort of Ajmer. Following his lead, nobles built gardens and dwellings for themselves in Ajmer. They also may have been responsible for the gates of the walled city, including one embellished with glazed tiles in its spandrels.

The construction of religious structures was encouraged by the new status that Akbar's interest in the Chishti sect conferred upon the city; this was enhanced by imperial decree. Annoyed that Khwaja Husain, the chief attendant of the Chishti shrine there, was improperly distributing its income, Akbar issued orders that mosques and *khanqahs* should be constructed in the territory, presumably with these funds as well as private ones. The mosque (Plate 40) situated immediately to the west of the *dargah's* south entrance is almost certainly a product of this order. It probably dates to the early 1570s,

![](_page_39_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 40. Akbari mosque, Ajmer

shortly after the order was issued. Called the Akbari mosque, the courtyard is entered through a large gate. The interior walls of the compound today are used as a madrasa, probably a continuation of their original function.

The mosque is not simply a regional expression; it clearly manifests an awareness of Timurid-inspired architecture at the center. In fact many believe the mosque was provided by Akbar himself. Colored stone bands frame the recessed large entrance arch and its spandrels, recalling Humayun's near-contemporary tomb (Plate 18). A high-arched *pishtaq* dominates the facade of the mosque's prayer chamber and appears a more refined version of the entrance to Humayun's Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque at Kachpura (Plate 12). The prayer chamber's plan, too, is based on the Kachpura mosque's. The east facade bears white marble inlaid in geometric patterns recalling designs on the Fatehpur Sikri Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque. The interior of the mosque, too, reveals an awareness of imperial trends, for example, the net pendentives that appeared on Humayun's Kachpura mosque and the Fatehpur Sikri *hammams.*

During the years that Akbar made pilgrimage to the shrine of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din Chishti, nobles also invested in the city. An inscription dating 1568-69 refers to the construction of a reservoir by Gesu Khan, in charge of the imperial

![](_page_40_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 41. Gate, *dargah* of Sayyid Husain Khing Sawar, Taragarh, Ajmer

kitchens and an officer in nearby Merta. The reservoir, however, cannot be identified, since the epigraph is no longer *in situ.* This inscription was designed by Darwish Muhammad al-Hajji al-Ramzi, the same calligrapher who designed the inscription on Husain Quli Khan's mosque in Nagaur.

He also designed the next known inscription from Ajmer. This epigraph is located on a towering gateway (Plate 41) marking the entrance to the shrine of Sayyid Husain Khing Sawar, situated on the fortified hill known as Taragarh above Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din's *dargah.* It attributes the gate's construction to Ismac il Quli Khan in 15 70-71. He was the younger brother of Husain Quli Khan, who had built the Nagaur Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque some four years earlier.

Sayyid Husain Khing Sawar had been the presiding officer of Ajmer under Aibek, the first Delhi sultan. He probably was martyred defending the fort in the early thirteenth century. Contemporary with the great saint, Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din, Sayyid Husain appears to have become his disciple. But it is only in the Mughal period that the religious status of Sayyid Husain was enhanced as was that of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din. Ismac il Quli Khan's gate at the foot of this hill, 19.5 meters high and 5 meters wide, remains the *dargah's* dominant feature. Looming above the architecturally undistinguished structures there, this red sandstone gate, now

whitewashed, serves as an entrance to the large interior courtyard that contains the saint's tomb. The gate itself is austere; its height, disproportionate to the narrow width, dominates the shrine. Surmounted by two *chattris,* the gate is pierced by a single open entrance whose apex terminates in an exaggerated ogee point. The use of the ogee arch appears to be a regional characteristic, recalling similar arches on near-contemporary monuments in nearby Nagaur and Merta. Regional, too, is the exaggerated height and much of the gate's form, similar to the pre-Mughal Buland Darwaza, serving as an entrance to the shrine below. At least one feature, however, recalls monuments in Delhi, the monumental rectangular band of Quranic verse framing the entrance. Similar bands of verse are also on the Sur-period Qal<sup>c</sup> a-i Kuhna mosque (Plate 5) and the madrasa of Maham Anga dated 1561.

After 1579, when Akbar made his last annual pilgrimage to Ajmer, construction there waned. At the *dargahs* of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din and Sayyid Husain Khing Sawar much had been built during the years of Akbar's pilgrimage. Among these is an enclosure around the graves of early Muslim martyrs at Sayyid Husain's shrine built in 1571-72 by Shah Quli Khan, an officer associated with Ajmer, Narnaul and Nagaur. Also several graves at the shrine of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din bear dates before 1579. Even Khwaja Husain, the very superintendent chastised by Akbar for mismanaging the *dargah's* income, constructed a dome over the tomb of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din Chishti in 1579. This may have been provided in response to Akbar's orders to build at the shrine and hence an attempt to regain imperial favor. But after 1579 Ajmer was provided with no new Mughal buildings until the reign of Jahangir. He revived the public display of devotion to Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din Chishti, and patronage in the city again increased with Jahangir's renewed interest in the shrine.

### *Baroda and Mandu*

Few monuments of Akbar's time survive in his westernmost domain, Gujarat. The octagonal tomb of Qutb al-Din Muhammad Khan(d. 1583), who provided the screens and floor at Shaikh Salim Chishti's tomb (Plate 26), breaks with the local regional style. This tomb, in Baroda, is a larger and less refined version of the type Shah Quli Khan had built about a decade earlier in Narnaul (Plate 43). Closer to central India, the fortified hill, Mandu, had been embellished with palaces, mosques and tombs provided by the fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Khalji sultans. Mandu was the doorway to the Deccan during the reigns of Akbar and Jahangir. Akbar visited it four times, while Jahangir stayed in the fort for about seven months. The Nil Kanth palace, a pleasure pavilion, was built there in 1574-75 by Budagh Khan, the officer in charge of Mandu under Akbar. Water is channelled through the central chamber of this palace to a pool in the open courtyard below, thus incorporating the landscape as is characteristic of Mughal architecture. One side of the palace is open and overlooks the

lush valley below. Inscriptions carved on the palace's walls record Akbar's victories in the Deccan in 1600—01, for Mandu was then used as a camp during Akbar's forays into the Deccan.

# *North India*

In the major Mughal cities of north India - Lahore, Delhi, Agra and Allahabad - mostly imperial monuments remain from Akbar's reign. In a few places, however, there are fine sub-imperial monuments. Those buildings show a degree of independence from imperial forms, even though their architects had absorbed or in some cases anticipated a sense of Akbar's imperial aesthetic.

One of these places is Hasan Abdal in Rawalpindi District, Pakistan, where Raja Man Singh built a terraced four-part garden over a waterfall. Not far from Hasan Abdal is the tomb of Khwaja Shams al-Din Khwafi, Akbar's governor there.<sup>49</sup> The flat-roofed octagonal tomb is pierced by deeply recessed arches and recalls similarly shaped pleasure pavilions such as the Hada Mahal at Fatehpur Sikri. Near the tomb is a deep tank fed by underground springs. In its crystal clear water large fish still swim, suggesting that the tomb building was originally conceived as a pleasure pavilion.

At Gwalior, the tomb of Muhammad Ghaus (Plate 42) is the most notable structure of Akbar's reign. The architecture of this fine stone building anticipates trends yet to become popular in Mughal architecture, especially in eastern India. Muhammad Ghaus, a celebrated saint and well-known writer of the Shattari order, died in 1563. His tomb was constructed sometime afterward. This impressive tomb is a square structure surmounted by a large squat dome and flanking *chattris* that give the structure a tiered or multi-storied effect. Around the walls of the tomb's central chamber is a continuous veranda enclosed in turn with screened walls. Such screened verandas derive from the architecture of Gujarat, for example, the tomb of Bai Harir in Ahmadabad. This reflects the considerable time Muhammad Ghaus had spent in Gujarat, a source of importance for Mughal tombs, for example, the tomb of Shaikh Salim Chishti built in 1580-81 at Fatehpur Sikri. Even through the mid-eighteenth century, many Mughal tombs including imperial ones continue to be enclosed by screens, although they often had no roofs.

#### *Narnaul*

In Narnaul, today in the state of Haryana, not far from Rajasthan, several Akbari structures are well preserved. During Akbar's time, Narnaul was a district headquarters and mint town in Agra Province. Its location between Delhi and the Rajput state of Marwar made Narnaul strategically important. It

#### 49 *Tuzuk,* 1: 99—100.

![](_page_43_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 42. Tomb of Muhammad Ghaus, Gwalior

was also an important place of pilgrimage for Hindus, and for Muslims, who concluded their sojourn at the shrine of a thirteenth-century *pir*, Shaikh Muhammad Turk Narnauli.<sup>50</sup> Akbar went to Narnaul to visit the esteemed contemporary Chishti Shaikh Nizam al-Din, one of the learned men of the time.<sup>51</sup> The Shaikh died in 1589 and was buried in a square stucco-covered tomb adhering to the older Lodi style; devotion to the Shaikh's memory was so great that in 1622 Ni<sup>c</sup>mat Allah, otherwise unknown, built a single-aisled threebayed mosque facing the tomb. It is beautifully covered with polychromed arabesques and Quranic inscriptions.

No one constructed more in Narnaul than did Shah Ouli Khan. Originally a protégé of Bhairam Khan, the powerful guardian of the young Akbar, Shah Quli Khan advanced rapidly in the Mughal court. First he rose in imperial favor when he wounded the Sur general Hemu, preventing the fall of the Mughals just after Akbar's accession. By the end of his life, he had been awarded the highest rank then bestowed on any noble. Renowned for his generosity, Shah Quli Khan gave large salary advances to his retinue and upon his deathbed in 1601-02 bestowed much money to charity. This later act, however, might be considered one of shrewdness, for all the property and money of a noble such

Plate 43. Tomb of Shah Quli Khan, Narnaul

as Shah Quli Khan, who had no immediate heirs, returned to the state upon his death.

Shah Quli Khan's architecture in Narnaul was of a personal sort, rather different from the enclosure he had built at the Taragarh shrine. His patronage of the Narnaul monuments was considered remarkable enough by his contemporaries that these works are mentioned in Mughal-period texts.52 Shah Quli Khan's first architectural project in Narnaul, his tomb (Plate 43), is dated 1574—75, three years after his enclosure at the Taragarh shrine. A multi-storied arched gateway, built fourteen years after the tomb, serves as the entrance to the tomb's walled garden compound. The tomb is a small octagonal structure faced with red and gray contrasting stones and surmounted by a white dome. While the contrasting stones closely resemble those used on the nearby tomb of Sher Shah's grandfather, the tomb's octagonal plan is very different from the octagonal type constructed by the Lodi and Sur kings. That type had consisted of an eight-sided veranda encircling a central chamber. Shah Quli Khan's tomb, however, has no veranda and more closely resembles the cylindrical octagonal

> 52  *Maasir,* in: 776; Bhakkari, *Dhakhirat al-Kbawanin,* 1: 181.

pavilion known as the Sher Mandal (Plate 11) in Delhi's Purana Qalca and the so-called Hada Mahal, a pleasure pavilion situated near the lake at Fatehpur Sikri, both inspired by Iranian pleasure pavilions. That Shah Quli Khan's tomb resembles a pleasure pavilion is appropriate. The building, constructed some twenty-five years before Shah Quli Khan's death, was situated in a large planned garden and was used in his life as part of his residential estate.

Variations of this octagonal tomb-type are widely used in north India. For example, Shamsher Khan's elegantly painted tomb in Batala constructed in 1589-90 is similar, as are the undated octagonal tombs in Bahlolpur, said to be those of Bahadur Shah and Husain Shah. A similar structure, the tomb dated 1612–13 built in Nakodar for Mumin Husaini (Plate 78), a musician at the court of the Khan-i Khanan, a high-ranking noble under Akbar and Jahangir, indicates the continuing popularity of this type later in the Mughal period.

Some fifteen years after he built his tomb, Shah Quli Khan constructed nearby a second gateway situated on the northern edge of a large square tank. It opens to an arched causeway that leads to a pleasure pavilion (Plate 44) situated in the tank's center. The tank and pavilion were commenced in 1590-91 and completed two years later. Inscriptions here show that paradisical imagery continues to be a trademark of Mughal architecture, for the tank in which the tomb sits is called a "second Kausar" (a pool in paradise) and its water "the water of immortality";<sup>53</sup> in addition, both the pavilion itself and Shah Quli's tomb are equated with paradise. While such inscriptions often praise the patron, their flattery is usually very general. Here, however, specific reference is made to the patron's heroism of nearly fifty years earlier, when he defeated the Sur general Hemu, thus saving Mughal hegemony. Shah Quli Khan is called "the honor of the country ... who carried away the ball of valor from his rivals."54

Shah Quli Khan's pavilion, locally known as the Jal Mahal or Water Palace, resembles various imperial structures in its individual parts; in combination, it resembles no single one, but combines these features in an innovative fashion. For example, the pavilion's location in the midst of a tank recalls water pavilions at Fatehpur Sikri that sat on the edge of a lake, although both the Hada Mahal and Qush Khana there are octagonal. The chattris of the superstructure recall another building at Fatehpur Sikri, the so-called Diwan-i Khass. Such multiple *chattris* on flat roofs were typical of domestic architecture, as contemporary illustrations show. This pavilion, then, probably draws inspiration from buildings at Fatehpur Sikri, and in turn it served as a model for a similar pavilion in Bairat (Jaipur District). That pavilion, dated about a decade later than the Jal Mahal and attributed to Raja Man Singh, was also set in water.

Other tombs constructed by amirs of Akbar's time also adhere to no single architectural form, even though their individual components are commonly rendered in evident Mughal style. That is the case, for example, with the tomb of Mirza Muzaffar Husain (d. 1603) in Delhi, known locally as the Bara Batashewala Mahal. This is a flat-roofed structure once probably surmounted by a textile canopy. Its ground floor, like that of the Jal Mahal and Humayun's tomb, has a central chamber surrounded by eight smaller rooms. This type of plan is derived from Iranian prototypes. Perhaps it is no accident that the Bara Batashewala Mahal is situated just outside the walls of Humayun's tomb. Another type, this one rooted in the earlier Sultanate architectural tradition, simply consists of a single *chattri* on a raised plinth. At times, this type includes a wall mosque and a small entrance gate, as in the case of the tomb of Miyan Raib, dated 1594, in Jhajjar (Haryana). This is not the first Mughal tomb of this older type; the tomb of Saqi Sultan (Plate 45) in Rohtas fort, Bihar, dated 1579—80, is similar.

## *Eastern India*

Mughal authority was imposed with difficulty on eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, and Orissa. When the Mughals were attempting to consolidate their power in areas closer to Delhi and Agra, Afghan clans and nobles reasserted

![](_page_47_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 45. Tomb of Saqi Sultan, Rohtas

themselves in eastern India. Slowly, however, this region fell to the Mughals. Eastern Uttar Pradesh came under Mughal control early in Akbar's reign; the Gangetic valley of Bihar was tentatively taken by Akbar in 1574. It was secured by him after a serious uprising in 1580 instigated by a number of dissatisfied Mughal amirs and Afghans under the leadership of Mac sum Khan Kabuli; then this territory, as well as much of Orissa, was successfully incorporated into the Mughal domain. While Bengal was claimed by Akbar in 1575, Mughal consolidation there was not fully achieved until Jahangir's reign. This prolonged effort to assert Mughal authority in eastern India was accompanied by vigorous architectural construction on the part of Mughal governors and other officials, an attempt to underscore a permanent Mughal presence there.

## *Jaunpur and Chunar*

Jaunpur, some 40 km north of Benares, also known as Varanasi, had been a leading intellectual center in northern India during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Until Akbar's forces took Patna and other territory in the Bihar Gangetic valley, Jaunpur remained the most important eastern seat of the Mughal empire. In 1567, Akbar appointed Khan-i Khanan Muhammad Mun<sup>c</sup> im Khan, a noble faithful since the days of Humayun, as governor there.

![](_page_48_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 46. Munc im Khan's bridge, Jaunpur

His tenure in Jaunpur and the extensive surrounding territory, including the stronghold of Chunar, lasted until his death in 1575. Instrumental in Mughal expansion to the east, Mun<sup>c</sup> im Khan was considered one of Akbar's most loyal nobles.

He extensively refurbished the city of Jaunpur, which had been ravaged by the Lodis. Among his works there is a bridge and additions to the older fort. Tradition records that he also constructed mosques throughout the city. Epigraphic evidence, however, indicates these were built by others, suggesting that Mun<sup>c</sup> im Khan's own patronage served as a stimulus for nobles directly responsible to him.

Mun<sup>c</sup> im Khan's bridge (Plate 46), still used today, is generally recognized as Jaunpur's most significant Mughal structure. One Mughal writer states that although the Khan-i Khanan had no heirs, his descendant, the Jaunpur bridge, "will preserve his name for ages."55 It consists of ten arched openings supported on massive pylons; *chattris* line either side of the top. The six inscriptions on the bridge indicate that it was commenced in 1564-65 and completed in 1568-69. A Persian history of Jaunpur states that Mun<sup>c</sup> im Khan constructed the bridge in response to a discourse by Akbar in which he, hearing a widow

#### 55 *Maasir,* n: 291.

complain about the lack of ferry service across the Gumpti, proclaimed that it is better to provide public works than religious edifices.56 The story is probably apocryphal, but it suggests that just as amirs in Ajmer built in response to Akbar's decree, so here, too, the Khan-i Khanan's architectural patronage was inspired by the ruler himself.

The fort walls were constructed earlier, but the massive eastern gate is generally ascribed to Mun<sup>c</sup> im Khan's patronage. It is embellished with blue and yellow tiles similar to those on contemporary buildings of the independent sultans of Bengal. So also a palace known as the Chehil Sutun was probably his product. While traditionally the palace is said to have been built in the fourteenth century, early nineteenth-century drawings indicate that this administrative or residential structure was constructed in a typical Akbari idiom. These drawings of the now demolished palace suggest the early introduction of an imperial style in these eastern hinterlands. The ground floor of this square double-storied structure is encompassed by a pillared veranda or *aiwan;* the whole is surmounted by a large pillared *chattri.* While no specific remaining structure at the Agra fort or Fatehpur Sikri can be cited as the model, the Jaunpur palace captures the flavor of contemporary imperial architecture. In turn, it may have been instrumental in the design of the palace Raja Man Singh constructed in the Rohtas fort about twenty years later, when he served as Akbar's governor of Bihar.

Near the site of the Chehil Sutun is a domed and vaulted multi-chambered *hammam* (Plate 47) that closely resembles the baths of Fatehpur Sikri. This Jaunpur bath, with its carefully planned arrangements for hot and cold water, is a rare example of an intact provincial bath. Since the *hammam* appears not to have been introduced to India until the Mughal period, its presence in the easternmost hinterlands early in Akbar's reign is indicative of the rapid spread of technology and style.

Although the Jaunpur fort served as the governor's residence early in Akbar's reign, two forts were defensively more important: the fort of Chunar, acquired by Akbar in 1561, and the fort of Allahabad, constructed in 1580. Eventually as the Mughals increased their landholdings further to the east, as far as modern Bangladesh, Jaunpur's significance was overshadowed.

Possession of the Chunar fortress long had been considered pivotal to the ultimate control of eastern India, for it guarded both the Ganges and the major land routes. Humayun held the fort briefly, but it was recaptured by the Surs. It was ceded to other Afghans, who held it until 1561, when they joined the Mughal ranks. Abu al-Fazl, discussing Chunar's importance, called its acquisition by Akbar one of the important events of that year. In 1566 Akbar

Plate 47. *Hammam*, Jaunpur

visited the fort personally, but in describing that visit Abu al-Fazl neglected to note the fort's appearance. However, its present appearance suggests that much of it was constructed in Akbar's reign. Chunar's stone quarries, famous since Maurya times, provided abundant stone and skilled masons. Thus, the task of rebuilding the fort was relatively simple.

The fort's west gate is its only inscribed structure. It bears four Persian epigraphs indicating that the gate was built during the reign of Akbar in 1573-74 by Muhammad Sharif Khan.<sup>57</sup> His identity has not yet been established, although he may have been the son of Abd al-Samad, the famous painter. Muhammad Sharif probably served under Mun<sup>c</sup>im Khan, who had been granted Chunar and a great deal of surrounding territory as income-yielding land in 1567.<sup>58</sup> Muncim Khan held Chunar until his death in 1575.59

This gate bears little ornamentation other than the beautifully executed calligraphic slabs. The fort's other gates, by contrast, have intricately carved panels and brackets (Plate 48). Such carving in general fits well with contemporary trends. For example, the S-shaped brackets of the oriel windows on some of these gates more closely resemble work in Agra than any pre-Mughal monuments in eastern India. However, some of the designs, for example a continuous knot motif, are closer to work on Sur-period architecture in Chainpur and Sher Shah's fortress at Shergarh, both some 60 to 75 km east of Chunar, than they are to the Mughal material. This suggests not only a reliance on local artisans, but also a continuation of some regional traditions.

## *Bihar*

In Bihar province, today roughly corresponding to the northern and central portions of Bihar state, by far the most important work of Akbar's time was in the hill fort of Rohtas. In 1576 Akbar's troops captured Rohtas from rebel Afghan forces and used the hill fort, some 45 km in circumference, as a garrison pivotal in controlling the rest of eastern India.

Although Rohtas had served as an important fort under the Sur dynasty, the Mughals developed a different portion of the fort. The palace at Rohtas that Raja Man Singh built was discussed earlier in this chapter, but it was not the first Mughal building in the fort. A mosque (Plate 49) had been built in 1578, only two years after the fort became Mughal. This was the first Mughal monument in all Bihar province. Built by an Akbar loyalist, Habash Khan, who died defending Rohtas against renegade Mughal amirs and Afghan rebels, the mosque is similar in appearance to the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque constructed on the hill thirty-five years earlier by Haibat Khan, one of Sher Shah Sur's leading generals. Both adhere to a single-aisled three-bayed rectangular plan. Differences are slight. The central *pishtaq* of the Mughal mosque is lower, and its facade bears intricately carved panels, recalling similar work on a gate at the Chunar fort. Although the Mughal mosque resembles the earlier Afghan one,

situated about 3 km away, it bears an inscription over the central entrance arch that might be interpreted as a poignant statement of Mughal supremacy. Opening with the Quranic phrase, "With God's help victory is imminent," most of this Persian inscription refers to Akbar's victories and concludes with an appeal, in Arabic, to "deliver this good news to believers."<sup>60</sup> Considering the shaky political situation at this time, the inscription can be interpreted as a proclamation of Mughal authority over rebels in Bihar.

A single mosque is not enough to suggest an urban setting. There were, however, other Akbari structures on the hill which indicate the presence of a permanent and continuous large population. By far the largest and most important of these is the palace of Raja Man Singh, discussed earlier. Numerous smaller buildings, mostly tombs, remain in the vicinity of the palace and Habash Khan's mosque. Among these are a *chattri* and wall mosque serving as the tomb of Saqi Sultan (Plate 45), who died in 1579-80, before he could attain the title khan, which he greatly coveted.<sup>61</sup> Further testimony to the fort's large population is a service town at the foot of the hill. It was – and still is - called Akbarpur, after the then-ruling monarch. Thus, although relatively

inaccessible and strongly fortified, Rohtas appears to have functioned as a major urban center as long as it remained a significant administrative center. During the latter part of Akbar's reign, Rohtas fort operated in much the same manner as his completely planned city-palace of Fatehpur Sikri. That is, it was the symbolic seat of the head of state, here the Mughal governor of Bihar, who was the official representative of Mughal authority. But here, even more than at Fatehpur Sikri, the commercial and agrarian components largely were aimed at serving the immediate city.

While Rohtas was an important military headquarters, it was the cities of Hajipur, Patna and Munger, situated on the Ganges, as well as Bihar Sharif, the traditional administrative center of Bihar and long a site of tremendous religious importance, that were the major urban settlements. Inscriptions indicate Akbar-period building activity in all of them except Patna. This is ironic, for Patna was very large, even containing the mint for Bihar Province, and except during Man Singh's governorship it was the leading administrative center.

Hajipur, situated at the confluence of the Gandak and Ganges, across from Patna, was considered the key to north Bihar. The city had been the landholding of Sac id Khan, who on three separate occasions served as governor of Bihar. Here in 1586-87, during Sac id Khan's first period of governorship, his brother Makhsus Khan built a mosque, the second known Mughal mosque in Bihar. Although the mosque's facade and entrance gate were seriously damaged in the 1934 earthquake, the original layout is intact, and the interior (Plate 50) appears little changed. The mosque's adherence to older Afghan style mosques as well as its Bengali forms, for example, the minbar and curved cornice of the entrance gate, suggest a reliance on local designers. The link with Bengal in particular is not surprising since Hajipur, often in Bengali hands, was an important naval headquarters under the pre-Mughal Husain Shahi dynasty. Thus in Bihar, except for Raja Man Singh's outstanding patronage, architectural design remained conservative.

#### *Bengal*

Until 1575 Bengal was under the control of various Afghan houses. Then Akbar's troops brought Bengal into the Mughal empire. Subsequently several revolts against Akbar's authority were staged by renegade nobles of the Mughal camp. Ironically, during this chaotic period, a Mughal style of architecture was introduced by the rebels.

Bengali Islamic architecture had a marked regional character. It was founded on a well-established Islamic style in Bengal illustrated by several monuments constructed on the eve of Mughal authority there. Among these are the doubleaisled six-domed mosque of Kusumba built in 1558-59, and the square-plan single-domed tomb of Pir Bahram in Burdwan dated 1562-63. The former is

Plate 50. Interior, Makhsus Khan's mosque, known also as the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque, Hajipur

stone-faced, while the latter is brick-constructed, and both, like most pre-Mughal architecture of Islamic Bengal, have a prominent curved cornice. Their plan and elevation - even the ornamental brick - reflect forms that were at the time several centuries old. From this foundation, the Mughal style of Bengal evolves.

Only five years after the establishment of Mughal authority in Bengal, and before any known Mughal building had been erected there, Afghan chiefs revolted against Mughal authority and assumed power. The Afghan Mac sum Khan Kabuli, a renegade Mughal noble, declared himself ruler of Bengal, even though the imperial Mughals maintained nominal control. By 1581 Mac sum Khan Kabuli had assumed the title of sultan, as indicated by an inscription on the first surviving Mughal monument in Bengal, the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque at Chatmohar (Pabna District). About one year later, in 1582, two mosques were constructed, each reflecting divergent stylistic traditions. The Qutb Shahi mosque of 1582-83 in Pandua, built by Makhdum Shaikh in honor of the longdeceased but deeply revered saint, Nur Qutb cAlam, adheres to a plan popular in Bengal since the fourteenth century. This stone-faced mosque is divided into two aisles of five bays each. Not only is it constructed in the traditional Bengali

style, but also the inscription is in Arabic, the language of most pre-Mughal inscriptions in Bengal.62 This is the last stone-faced mosque built in Bengal until the twentieth century, and it is the last small double-aisled rectangular mosque constructed in Bengal until the nineteenth century. A different trend is represented by the single-aisled, three-bayed plan of the Kherua mosque in Sherpur (Bogra District), also built in 1582 (Plate 51). Its patron was Murad Khan, son of Jauhar cAli Khan Qaqshal. The Qaqshal were an Afghan tribe that, along with other Afghan groups who followed Ma<sup>c</sup> sum Khan Kabuli, sought to oust the Mughals from Bengal. Sherpur, the city in which the mosque is situated, served as the rebel headquarters. Ironically, however, it was this mosque-type that became standard in Mughal and post-Mughal Bengal.

The Kherua mosque's single-aisled, three-bayed plan recalls not only north Indian types but also that of Habash Khan's mosque of 1578 built in Rohtas (Plate 49). While Bengali features remain, such as the brick construction, curved cornice and engaged ribbed corner turrets, the plan is a departure from that of traditional Bengali mosques. This may be attributed to the fact that the ruler, Ma<sup>c</sup> sum Khan Kabuli, and many of his rebel followers who had served earlier in Bihar under the Mughals, were familiar with north Indian forms, as well as with the mosques in the great stronghold of Rohtas. When serving the Mughals they had assisted with the fort's initial takeover and later tried to capture Rohtas for themselves.

Older Hindu sculptures were imbedded in the mosque's east facade, leaving only the back visible; that part was carved with a Persian inscription. Reuse of Hindu materials in such a prominent fashion is rare in Bengal after the fourteenth century; the Qaqshal rebels were probably cut off from sources of freshly quarried stone, which would have been used for an inscription on a brick monument, and so had to rely on available materials. This, as much as desecration of a Hindu shrine, probably explains the images' use. Both epigraphs are written in Persian, the *lingua franca* of the Mughal court, rather than Arabic, more common in Bengal. This is yet another indication that Bengali architecture was moving closer to a pan-Indian idiom whose standards were established at imperial centers. Because of their former association with the Mughal court, the Qaqshal, now rebels, were nevertheless planting the seeds in Bengal of an architectural vocabulary that would become standard throughout the subcontinent from the seventeenth century on.

While the language of the inscriptions is characteristic of Mughal epigraphs, the content of these inscriptions is unusual.<sup>63</sup> However, it is perhaps apt for a mosque constructed by rebels. The inscription, still *in situ,* recounts the story

of two pigeons from Mecca, a metaphor for the rebel Qaqshal, who request from a faqir shelter for themselves and for their friends. The faqir grants the permission but states that the mosque is small and will not shelter them from violence. In response, the pigeons say that God's wrath would be great if the mosque or pigeons were harmed. The second inscription, no longer *in situ,* also admonishes protection of the mosque. Such a plea for protection is appropriate to the world of rebels and appears to have been taken seriously, for the mosque remains in excellent preservation. The otherwise unknown Nawab Mirza Murad Khan Qaqshal thus should be remembered for erecting the first known Bengali mosque of a type that was to become popular throughout Bengal.

Elsewhere in Bengal, architectural activity in Akbar's time was confined largely to Rajmahal, the capital, where Raja Man Singh was active; his Mughalstyle architecture is discussed earlier in this chapter. However, in Malda, a large trade city that benefited from the prosperity of the important shrines in nearby Pandua, a Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque (Plate 52) was erected in 1595-96, shortly after Raja Man Singh assumed the governorship of Bengal. This was a period when the Mughals began to have some effect in quelling the dissident rebel forces. In the mosque's inscription, neither the patron nor ruling monarch is recorded. It

does, however, identify the mosque's location as in "Hind,"<sup>64</sup> an area roughly corresponding with north India. This reveals identity with the territory then ruled by the Mughals, not just Bengal.

The Malda Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque shows an increasing adoption of north Indian forms. The interior gives a sense of open space rarely seen in Bengali rectangular mosques, but common in north Indian examples. The central vaulted corridor is derived from Bengali prototypes, for example the Adina and Gunmant mosques, while north Indian influence is seen in the single-aisled plan. The mosque's ornamentation, too, shows a heightened awareness of north Indian models, for both the facade and interior are largely plastered with a smooth stucco veneer reminiscent, for example, of Humayun's mosque in Kachpura (Plate 12).

The construction of this large mosque suggests the continued economic importance of Malda, despite political turmoil. This is not surprising, for urban centers not wholly created as political centers tend to survive administrative changes, wars and even natural calamity.

The most notable Mughal monument in Malda is a tower known today as the Nim Serai Minar (Plate 53). Located across the river from the mosque, this

> 64 Ahmed, *Inscriptions of Bengal,* pp. 258-59.

![](_page_58_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 53. Nim Serai Minar, Malda

minaret or tower is aligned with the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque's qibla wall, the west-facing one. Its name, meaning half, suggests a location between Gaur and Pandua and indicates that it probably served as a mile marker, as did the similar tower at Fatehpur Sikri (Plate 27). The location of this tower, on a hill overlooking the confluence of two rivers, at that time major transport routes, suggests that it also may have served as a watch tower.

The tower's facade is covered with stone projections resembling elephant tusks, similar to those on the tower at Fatehpur Sikri. Overall, the Malda tower's form recalls the earlier Chor Minar in Delhi, used to display the heads of thieves. It is thus possible that the Malda tower was constructed when Mughal governors in Bengal were subduing rebel forces and here displayed rebel heads, a custom earlier practiced by the Mughal forebear, Timur. Later than this, during the rebel prince Shah Jahan's bid for the throne in 1625, the heads of some 430 traitors were reportedly on display at Akbarnagar, that is, Rajmahal. In addition, Peter Mundy, traveling through the Mughal empire in 1631, makes references to numerous minarets or towers displaying the heads of executed thieves, noting that these were to be found near important cities. The

location of the Malda tower, aligned with a mosque inscribed as being situated in greater India, not just Bengal, makes the possibility of this tower serving as a symbol of strong Mughal presence in this trade town all the more likely.

## CONCLUSION

During Akbar's reign imperially sponsored architecture incorporates Timurid design concepts with forms, motifs and building techniques long indigenous to Indian architecture. Many of the resulting buildings, for example much of the palace at Fatehpur Sikri, are highly refined products of prevailing Indian tastes, although the organization and spatial arrangements owe much to Timurid concepts. Akbar, like Humayun, was little involved with religious architecture with the exception of the great *khanqah* at Fatehpur Sikri. He built primarily forts and palaces, building types that reflect his concept of the Mughal state. The function of many parts of his palaces is often impossible to determine, reflecting the fluid nature of court ceremony in Akbar's reign. This, as we shall see, contrasts with palaces built under subsequent rulers. Akbar also continued to build *char baghs,* initially introduced to India by Babur. The tomb he built for his father, Humayun, is the first to be set in such a garden. Such funereal settings, evoking visions of paradise, commences what will become a longstanding Mughal architectural concern.

Akbar built primarily at his capitals and also defensively at the major cities on the frontier of his domain, such as Allahabad. But Mughal architecture was not confined to these places; rather, it expanded to the hinterlands. There, though, the architecture was built not by the emperor but by his nobles, whose taste most often echoed that of the center. In this expanding Mughal empire, architecture increasingly served as a symbol of Mughal presence.
