## CHAPTER 4

# IAHANGIR: AN AGE OF TRANSITION

Upon the death of Akbar in 1605, Muhammad Sultan Salim assumed the imperial throne. He took the title Nur al-Din Muhammad Jahangir Badshah Ghazi, hence the name Jahangir by which he is most commonly known. It is generally believed that during Jahangir's 22-year reign, half as long as Akbar's, patronage for buildings declined because of his enthusiasm for painting. Further, common belief credits Jahangir's influential wife, Nur Jahan, a leading taste setter of the time, with stimulating the construction of buildings later in the emperor's reign. Her role as patron cannot be denied, but Jahangir continually refers in his own memoirs to his patronage of tombs, pleasure pavilions, forts and gardens as well as to the restoration of older structures. In fact, Jahangir in his memoirs refers more often to architecture he found pleasing or to buildings he ordered than to paintings he commissioned, even though he is regarded as a great connoisseur of painting. During Jahangir's reign the realm was secure. Thus the nobles were encouraged to embellish cities, construct serais, gardens and dwellings and endow shrines - all concrete manifestations of a prosperous state.

#### HISTORICAL CONTEXT

Salim was the name given to Jahangir by his father, Akbar, in honor of Salim, the Chishti saint of Fatehpur Sikri who had predicted his birth. He was Akbar's oldest son and heir-apparent. Akbar gave the young prince an education befitting his rank. The leading nobles and scholars such as the great littérateur, Khan-i Khanan cAbd al-Rahim, and the leading theologian, Shaikh cAbd al-Nabi, were charged with responsibility for educating the future emperor. Well versed in Persian and Hindi and with a respectable knowledge of Turki, Prince Salim also possessed a good grounding in history, the natural sciences, geography, martial skills and theology - all part of the traditional Islamic curriculum considered appropriate for a prince. But more than this formal education, his innate sense of observation, inherited from his greatgrandfather, Babur, coupled with his extraordinary taste for the exquisite and the unusual made him a remarkable connoisseur of art, rare animals and birds, as well as jewels. His ability to discern the beauty of objects and animals never waned, while his treatment of fellow humans vacillated between cruelty and sensitive tenderness.

Before Salim ascended the throne and assumed the title Iahangir, his two brothers had died prematurely, reputedly from drink, one in 1599 and the other in 1604. Nevertheless, his accession was not without issue. Eager to obtain the throne. Salim revolted in 1600 and established his own court in Akbar's Allahabad fort. Salim struck coins in his own name and assumed imperial titles. Akbar thus sought to consult his confidant and biographer, Abu al-Fazl, then in the Deccan, Salim, however, had him assassinated in 1602. While Salim's revolt did not shake the stability of Akbar's empire, it did shape future events. Several of the most prominent courtiers urged Akbar to skip a generation by designating Khusrau, Salim's oldest son, as his successor. As a result, a tremendous rift occurred between the two princes, father and son, each aspiring to the throne.

Finally, late in 1604 Akbar marched toward Allahabad, but turned back to Agra upon hearing that his mother, Maryam Makhani, had died. After Akbar's return to Agra, Salim followed, probably eager to curtail the elevation of his son, Khusrau, to heir-apparent. Salim and Akbar were more or less reconciled, and the scheme to designate Khusrau as heir failed. On his death-bed in 1605, Akbar designated Salim as his successor.<sup>1</sup>

Salim, who began writing his memoirs at the time of his accession, explains that he took the title Jahangir, or World Seizer, since it was the business of kings to control the world; the title Nur al-Din, or Light of the Faith, was appropriate since his accession "coincided with the rising and shining on the earth of the great light, the Sun."<sup>2</sup> The assumption of this title is particularly noteworthy, for it indicates, among much other evidence, that the importance of light and light-imagery under Akbar continued under Jahangir. For example, light imagery is also apparent in painting commissioned by Jahangir, especially in his allegorical portraits, as well as in imperial funereal architecture. Abu al-Fazl had developed the notion of light imagery associated with the emperor's semidivine status. How ironic, then, that Jahangir, responsible for Abu al-Fazl's brutal murder, made extensive use of light imagery in his writing and art.

Mughal ties with the Chishti saints, maintained by Akbar until 1579, were revived by Jahangir. The emperor's memoirs open with an account of Akbar's journey on foot to the great Chishti shrine in Ajmer and Shaikh Salim's prophecy of the birth of a son. Subsequently in his memoirs, Jahangir recalls that early in his childhood the dying Shaikh Salim had placed his turban on the young prince's head, saying that the prince would be his spiritual successor. Jahangir enacts this role by endowing the Chishti shrines when on pilgrimage. Such patronage must be viewed as an attempt to link Mughal rule to a spiritual source, specifically the one that once had guided his father. It is also motivated

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>2</sup> Tuzuk, 1: 2-3.

by personal piety, but the renewed Chishti link in no way suggests increased orthodoxy in official policy.

Military campaigns were relatively unimportant in the reign of Jahangir. Happy to reside in Akbar's largely consolidated empire, Jahangir waged few offensive campaigns. His major victories included the defeat of Rana Amar Singh of Mewar, a campaign brilliantly conducted by Prince Khurram, the future Shah Jahan. This victory was commemorated by the construction of a palace at Pushkar. Jahangir's troops also captured the Kangra fort, and they consolidated Mughal rule in Bengal and Assam. Other campaigns were less successful. During all of them Jahangir remained far from the action.

The course of Jahangir's reign was changed by his marriage in 1611 to Mehr al-Nisa, the widow of Sher Afghan, a Mughal noble. Although he had other wives, she was brilliant and by far the most powerful of them all. She was first given the title Nur Mahal (Light of the Palace) and later, in 1616, Nur Jahan (Light of the World), the name by which she is best known. Born of Iranian parents, Nur Jahan together with her father, I<sup>c</sup>timad al-Daula, and her brother, Asaf Khan, assumed increasing power. By 1622, when Jahangir's poor health, exacerbated by immoderate consumption of wine and opium, rendered him incapable of attending to the affairs of state, Nur Jahan's power was nearly absolute.

Until this time, both Jahangir and Nur Jahan considered Khurram, the future Shah Jahan, to be Jahangir's heir. However, upon the marriage of Nur Jahan's daughter from her first marriage to Prince Shahriyar, Jahangir's son by another wife, the empress no longer supported Khurram, but actively championed Shahriyar's cause. This, in part, led to a rebellion on the part of Khurram, which resulted in his seizure of Bihar and Bengal and ultimately the loss of Qandahar for the Mughals. Jahangir died in 1627. Nur Jahan's schemes failed, and although she survived her husband for eighteen years, she wielded no more power in the Mughal court.

# PATRONAGE OF THE EMPEROR AND EMPRESS The establishment of authority (c. $1600-10$ )

In 1600, Prince Salim established his own court in Akbar's Allahabad fort. Assuming the title Shah Salim, he operated as an independent ruler but did little to upset Mughal authority much beyond Allahabad. The rebel prince's patronage of painters, especially Aqa Reza, is well known, but there is no evidence that he constructed buildings during this period. The self-styled king, rather, commissioned smaller objects that he himself might use. In 1602-03 Shah Salim ordered construction of a black throne (Plate 54), essentially a large polished slab whose sides were engraved with verses praising the throne and its occupant, Shah Salim. While no calligrapher's name is given, the lettering and

sinuous floral background indicate the work of Mir cAbd Allah Mushkin Qalam.<sup>3</sup> Even five years after he became emperor, this throne continued to hold significance for Jahangir; he ordered that it be brought from Allahabad to the Agra fort and then added verses to those already on the throne. These new verses, crowded under the original composition, state Jahangir's rightful claim to the throne.

Just after his coronation, Jahangir commissioned a verse in honor of his accession. Composed and designed by Muhammad Mac sum of Bakkar, a renowned calligrapher of Akbar's reign, it was carved on the Delhi gate of Akbar's Agra fort. The verse itself is a hopeful portent for Jahangir's long and successful rule; its location, under an inscription of Akbar, links Jahangir to his father and further underscores the concept of his rightful claim to kingship.

Like all the Mughal emperors, Jahangir was proud of his Timurid heritage. This is made apparent by a monument that attracted Jahangir's support on the eve of his accession - a Maurya-period (third century B.C.) monolithic column that long had been lying on the ground of Akbar's Allahabad fort. Jahangir re-erected it, as indicated in a Persian epigraph written on the shaft by Mir cAbd Allah Mushkin Qalam, between 15 August and 13 September, 1605, several months before Jahangir's coronation. This inscription gives Jahangir's entire lineage down to Timur; the names of God are interspersed with those of his ancestors, underscoring the Mughal notion that kings are divinely chosen. This text was added to other inscriptions on the column, including edicts of the famous Maurya emperor, Ashoka. Thus, in a sense, he continued his father's long-standing policy of linking Mughal rule to both the Timurid tradition and to deeply rooted Indian traditions.

In 1607 Jahangir entered Kabul and there visited Babur's gardens. Between two of the gardens he ordered the erection of a large white stone slab. There he had inscribed his lineage back to Timur and verses linking his name with justice. Jahangir also recorded in his memoirs another garden, known as the Seat of the King, Takht-i Shah, where Babur in 1508-09 had carved a large stone basin and throne inscribed with his name. There Jahangir ordered a twin wine basin and throne inscribed with Timur's name and his own.

Thus early in his reign Jahangir used inscriptions on large monuments to link himself with his immediate Mughal predecessors as well as with Timur, the ultimate source of Mughal legitimacy. By the time he was well established, he no longer did this.

A concern with legitimacy was not Jahangir's sole reason for architectural patronage during his initial years as king. His memoirs indicate a lively and varied interest in building. In 1606, he ordered a tower (Plate 68) similar to the

Hiran Minar at Fatehpur Sikri (Plate 27), to be built next to the grave of a favorite antelope at Jahangirpur, a place known today as Sheikhupura, near Lahore. Jahangir ordered it be inscribed with a prose eulogy written by Mulla Muhammad Husain, whom Jahangir cites as the "chief of the elegant writers of the day."<sup>4</sup> Also in the same year he ordered buildings and a garden at his favorite spring in Kashmir, Vernag (Plate *6y).* According to Jahangir's memoirs as well as epigraphical evidence, he continued to develop both Sheikhupura and Vernag during the course of his reign. Jahangir also expressed delight over the small pleasure pavilion in Hasan Abdal, today in Punjab, Pakistan, that had been built by Raja Man Singh. Here Jahangir relaxed for several days in 1607, among other activities putting pearls in the noses of fish. Perhaps out of respect for Man Singh's pavilion at Hasan Abdal and the garden around it, Jahangir later ordered that a sizable sum be given for the construction of a bridge and serai and for restorations to an existing building there. These works at Hasan Abdal were not the only building enterprises of others that he admired. For example, he so liked Hakim cAli's house and underground reservoir that he elevated his rank. He described the quarters of Prince Khurram, the future Shah Jahan, in the Kabul fort as "delightful and well-proportioned."<sup>5</sup> On the other hand, Jahangir found his own quarters in this same fort unsuitable and ordered them destroyed to make room for a new palace and royal audience hall. Thus

> 4  *Tuzuk,* 1: 90-91. <sup>5</sup> *Tuzuk,* 1: 115.

Jahangir's keen aesthetic sense, best recognized in his admiration of painting, extended to architecture as well.

## Imperial terraced tombs

Jahangir's first wife, Shah Begum, the Rajput mother of Khusrau and sister of Raja Man Singh, poisoned herself in 1604. Jahangir attributed her suicide to Khusrau's quest for the throne; more certainly the public contention between her son and Jahangir were the cause of her unmitigated shame. She was buried in a garden in Allahabad, which came to be called Khusrau Bagh after Khusrau was buried there in 1622, and even today retains that name. Finch, traveling through Allahabad in 1611, called the garden Menepur and observed Shah Begum's sumptuous tomb there.

Aga Reza, the principal artist in Salim Shah's Allahabad court, was charged with the responsibility for constructing Shah Begum's tomb.<sup>6</sup> The garden's enormous west entrance gate, aligned with Shah Begum's tomb, bears an inscription of 1606-07, stating that "this lofty edifice was completed by Aqa Reza, the painter, a devoted official of the emperor."7 The inscription indicates that Mughal painters were expected to have talent beyond wielding the brush.

Dated 1606–07, Aqa Reza's Chunar sandstone gate is handsome, resembling more the entrance to a fort than to a pleasure garden. The deeply recessed entrance arch is flanked on either side by massive engaged bastions. The top is surmounted with battlements. Little ornamentation is carved on the solid surface.

By contrast, Shah Begum's three-tiered tomb (Plate 55) has a lighter, more graceful appearance. The overall conception may have been inspired by the Lodi-period tomb of Darya Khan in Delhi, formed of tiered plinths surmounted by a domed *chattri* covering a grave. The basic plan of Shah Begum's tomb, in turn, seems to have been a prime source for the design of Akbar's tomb. From the exterior, the ground floor today appears to be an austere platform, although eighteenth-century drawings indicate that here as well as on the next level carved screens surmounted each platform.

The top floor consists of a *chattri*. Situated centrally is the false cenotaph, common to Islamic tombs. On one end of the cenotaph is a vertical marble slab carved with a Persian epigraph giving the date of Shah Begum's death, 1604. This inscription as well as those on the sides of the cenotaph that describe Shah Begum's qualities were designed by Mir cAbd Allah Mushkin Qalam, a major

calligrapher for Jahangir. Earlier he designed Shah Salim's inscriptions on his black throne in Allahabad (Plate 54); shortly before Jahangir's accession, he executed the inscription on the Allahabad fort pillar. The calligraphy of these inscriptions, characteristic of Mir cAbd Allah's work, is interlaced with delicate floral arabesques.

Although the tomb bears no date, it was probably constructed concurrently with Aqa Reza's gate and certainly before 1611, when Finch saw it. The tomb, like the gate, is a relatively plain structure. Possibly, it would have been too plain for Jahangir's tastes, for he found the initial appearance of his father's tomb unsatisfactory. But given the difficulties during the first several years of his reign, when he had no time even to visit the tomb he was building for Akbar in Sikandra, it seems unlikely that he had much direct role in the design of Shah Begum's tomb.

The construction of Akbar's large multi-storied tomb within a *char bagh* (Plate 56) was Jahangir's most pressing architectural project. Although completed in Jahangir's reign, many believe that the tomb was commenced in Akbar's lifetime; however, its commencement is not mentioned in any contemporary history of Akbar's reign. The *Akbar Nama* simply states that the emperor was buried in a sacred garden called Behishtabad, that is, the Abode of Paradise, in Sikandra, a suburb of Agra. Other writers of the time, for example,

Muhammad Bagir Najm-i Sani in his literary praise of the tomb, mention only Jahangir as its patron and designer.<sup>8</sup>

Jahangir refers several times to Akbar's tomb. The first and most extensive reference records events of the year 1608, when Jahangir first saw the tomb and expressed great dissatisfaction with its progress. He noted that architects had built the tomb after their own designs, so he ordered that "experienced architects should again lay the foundations, in agreement with men of experience, in several places, on a settled plan. By degrees a lofty building ... a garden ... and a large and lofty gateway with minarets of white stone [were] built."9 The complex took several years longer to complete. William Finch, visiting the tomb in 1611, states that it was nowhere near completed. His description, however, suggests that the mausoleum itself was largely finished, while the surrounding gardens and gates were incomplete. Dated inscriptions on the south gate, the main entrance, indicate that it was completed between 1612 and 1614.

The tomb's garden setting follows that same basic format established with Humayun's tomb (Plate 19). That is, the square walled garden was sub-divided into four major sections by watercourses evoking the rivers of paradise. Thus the tomb is situated metaphorically in the center of a paradisical garden located in Behishtabad, the Abode of Paradise.

While the garden setting is modeled on that of Humayun's tomb, Akbar's mausoleum itself has little in common with his father's Timurid-influenced tomb. Akbar's tomb consists of five tiered stories. The top floor has no superstructure but consists of an open-air courtyard enclosed on all four sides by walls of carved white marble screening. There had been earlier multistoried tombs, such as that of Muhammad Ghaus (Plate 42), and the nearcontemporary tomb of Shah Begum, which influenced the appearance of Akbar's tomb. But the resemblance of this tomb to contemporary palace architecture distinguishes it from its predecessors. The tomb's pillared terraces and the numerous domed *chattris* of the upper stories yield a delicate silhouette resembling closely the five-tiered structure known as the Panch Mahal at Fatehpur Sikri (Plate 33).

The shift from Humayun's Timurid-inspired building type replete with paradisical imagery to tombs resembling contemporary palaces may appear surprising considering the Mughals' pride in their Timurid heritage. Palace building-types, moreover, are more suggestive of splendor, power and wealth than of paradise, the eternal abode of the just ruler on the Day of Judgment. However, the Quran mentions the "beautiful mansions in the Gardens of

<sup>9</sup> Tuzuk, I: 152.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>8</sup> Muhammad Baqir Najm-i Sani, *Kulliyat* (India Office Per. Ms. 1330), fls. 348–49. Baqir, who died in 1636, refers to Jahangir's "geometrical problem-solving mind" that he used for the construction of Akbar's mausoleum. for assistance in translation.

everlasting bliss" (9: 72) and more specifically proclaims, "lofty mansions, one above the other, have been built: Beneath them flow Rivers of delight" (39: 20).10 Hence paradisical imagery in imperial funereal architecture continues; however, it is now modeled upon, yet surpasses, a form of luxurious royal architecture.

The tomb's first floor, measuring nearly 105 meters per side, serves as a large square plinth for the top four stories. It houses the sarcophagus in a square central chamber; a continuous domed and vaulted gallery is on the building's perimeter. According to Sebastien Manrique, who visited the tomb in 1641, these chambers were used for the 200 readers of the Quran who maintained the tomb's sanctity. The central bay of each side is marked by a high *pishtaq* surmounted by a rectangular *chattri.* White marble inlay is used copiously both to form panels of geometric patterns along the sides of the central *pishtaq* and arabesques in their spandrels. The red sandstone fabric serves as a backdrop for the white marble. Hence the very materials used on this tomb are suggestive of the opulence promised to the true believer in paradise on the Day of Judgment.

<sup>10</sup> Translations from the Quran are by Abdullah Yusuf Ali (ed. and tr.), *The Meaning of the Glorious Qur'an,* 2 vols. (Cairo, 1938).

Of the interior vaulted chambers behind the four *pishtaqs,* the south one, which leads to the central domed chamber via a narrow corridor, is the most elaborate. The lower portions of the walls are inlaid with brown, yellow and black stones, like those on the floor of Shaikh Salim Chishti's tomb at Fatehpur Sikri, while the upper walls and flat domed roof are richly ornamented with incised and polychromed stucco forming floral patterns and arabesques. Gold-painted calligraphy against a deep blue background reproduces chapter 47 of the Quran and several other verses (33: 56; 37: 180-182). They stress God's unique power and glory and describe the gardens of paradise as the just reward for the true believer.

A long narrow corridor leads to an interior domed chamber that contains Akbar's sarcophagus. This square room, about 18 meters high, reaches the level of the tomb's third story. Although this interior was later whitewashed, European visitors report that originally it was painted with Christian subjects including angels and the Virgin Mary. But the presence of such images was a matter of fashion, not a reflection of religious belief.

Contemporary accounts describing the tomb's desecration by plundering Jats in the late seventeenth century indicate how sumptuous was the tomb's interior. Gold, silver and precious stones as well as all the carpets were pillaged. Significantly, the attack on Akbar's mausoleum was perceived as a blow to Mughal prestige, suggesting its continuing importance as a dynastic symbol.

Three stories rise above the ground level, each smaller than the previous one. Delicate red sandstone *chattris* are placed at frequent intervals along the exterior walls. The uppermost story consists of a square high walled enclosure composed entirely of white marble screens used increasingly into the seventeenth century for imperial mausolea (Plate 71). Since white marble previously had been associated with saints' shrines, the distinction between royalty and saints was now blurred. At each corner is a large domed *chattri;* the tomb has no other finials. Above the veranda's arch-shaped entrances are lintels that bear verses eulogizing the deceased emperor.

The tomb's upper story remains open to the sky (Plate 57). In the center is a magnificently carved white marble cenotaph; at its north end is a lamp stand *(chiraqdan),* also rendered in finely carved white marble. Many believe that such an exquisitely rendered marble cenotaph, carved with the ninety-nine names of God and intricate floral motifs, could not have been intended to remain exposed to the elements and that once there must have been a central dome. Yet an uncovered cenotaph is the grave-type that meets orthodox approval and may have been the reason for the open top story of Akbar's tomb. But that is only a partial explanation. Considering the Mughal fascination with light and light symbolism, the placement of this cenotaph directly under the sun and moon follows especially the interests of Akbar and Jahangir. Under-

Plate 57. Interior top story, Akbar's tomb, Sikandra

scoring this interpretation is the final verse of the Persian inscription on the tomb's entrance gate that reads: "May his [Akbar's] soul shine like the rays of the sun and the moon in the light of God."<sup>11</sup>

The imposing gate leading into the complex (Plate 58) bears the dates 1612-13 and 1613-14. It consists of an enormous recessed central arch flanked on either side by double-stacked side arches. Surmounting the gate are four towering white marble minarets, one at each corner. The ornamentation of this gate is more elaborate than that embellishing the tomb. Geometric patterns and large floral motifs formed from inlaid white marble and multi-colored stones stand out against the red sandstone ground. Continuous inscriptional bands of white marble follow the shape of the recessed arch on both the north and south facades. They were designed and written by cAbd al-Haqq Shirazi, later known as Amanat Khan, the designer of inscriptions on several major Mughal monuments including the Taj Mahal. The inscriptions on the north facade, the side

facing the tomb itself, appropriately eulogize the deceased emperor. Those on the south facade, however, largely praise the patron, Jahangir, but terminate with a poem confirming that the visual metaphors on the Mughal tombs are indeed references to paradise:

Hail, blessed space happier than the garden of Paradise Hail lofty buildings higher than the divine throne A paradise, the garden of which has thousands of Rizwans as servants A garden of which has thousands of paradises for its land The pen of the mason of the Divine Decree has written on its court These are the gardens of Eden, enter them and live forever.12

## *The past, and public works*

Jahangir's memoirs are full of details recounting his visits to the buildings of pre-Mughal rulers and the Mughal nobility. He even commented on how to tell if a house would bring prosperity or misfortune, indicating the significance that domestic architecture had for him.13 Subsequent comments indicate his sense that the structure's success does not depend on the building alone. The garden setting, the role of water and the view become crucial elements in his taste, a notion that had commenced with Babur. This is probably why pre-Mughal dwellings rarely please the emperor. He complains that most pre-Mughal structures in the famous Ranthambor fort were devoid of air and space; by contrast he praises the view, spatial arrangement and airiness of a bath, residence and garden also at Ranthambor built by a noble in Akbar's reign. While most Mughal-period structures seem to gain his favor, some do not. For example, he finds fault with Khwaja Waisi's maintenance of his lands in Sirhind, enjoining him to replant the gardens, to repair the baths and build new structures where necessary.

In spite of Jahangir's general dislike of pre-Mughal houses, he shows much enthusiasm for the great congregational mosques of the provinces, for example, the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque of Srinagar or the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque of Ahmadabad. However, the mosque he most admires is at Fatehpur Sikri. Due to a serious plague epidemic in Agra, Jahangir halted at Fatehpur Sikri for some time. He took much delight in showing his son, the future Shah Jahan, Akbar's palace there. Among the buildings of Fatehpur Sikri he discussed at length are the *khanqah* of Shaikh Salim Chishti, including a detailed description with measurements of the Shaikh's tomb and Akbar's great Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque (Plates 25 and 26). Jahangir's interest in this architecture of the past takes on special meaning, for he carefully explains that here he was designated by Shaikh Salim himself as his spiritual successor.

The emperor did not neglect the immediate needs of state in spite of this deep interest in the past. In 1611, he issued orders for the establishment of kitchens for the needy *(bulghur khanas)* in all large cities, and in 1619 he ordered that public wells and towers to mark distances *(kos minar)* should be erected at frequent, regular intervals between Bengal and the Punjab for the welfare of travelers. A number of *kos minar,* probably datable to Jahangir's time, still remain between Agra and Lahore. Tall conical structures composed of stone and rubble and covered with a stucco veneer, these dominant towers were possibly painted and covered with information giving distances and popular slogans - as they are today.

## *Jahangir's palaces: Agra and Lahore*

Historians of Shah Jahan's reign make clear that all Jahangir's structures in the Agra fort were destroyed and replaced with Shah Jahan's marble pavilions. Fortunately, however, these sources and others give us some insights into Jahangir's palaces there. In 1611 he entered a palace inside the Agra fort prepared for him by Khwaja Jahan Muhammad Dost, an architect who also

#### **i n**

built palaces for this emperor at Lahore and elsewhere. This palace, according to Jahangir, was completed in three months, suggesting that it was a fairly small structure, not the full extent of his buildings in the fort. Later historians, in the context of discussing Shah Jahan's renovations, state that Jahangir built three marble pillared chambers, indicating that the use of marble for palace structures pre-dates Shah Jahan's reign. These chambers were in close proximity to an octagonal turret known today as the Musamman Burj, that overlooks the Jumna river. This turret is a product of Shah Jahan's reign, replacing an earlier structure known as the Shah Burj, or King's Tower. To this tower Jahangir attached his famous Chain of Justice leading outside the fort. The bells of this chain permitted subjects to rouse the emperor so that he might hear their grievances, ideally at any time.

Accounts by European visitors to the court, some of whom stayed for considerable periods of time, indicate that Jahangir's viewing balcony *(jharoka)* from which he daily presented himself to the public was in close proximity to the Shah Burj. Beneath this balcony Jahangir in 1616 erected marble statues of the defeated rana of Mewar, Amar Singh, and his son, Karan. It is generally assumed that these statues of the now-submissive princes were a sign of the emperor's respect. Akbar, however, had placed statues of defeated Rajput foes at the Agra palace's Elephant gate to serve as a reminder of the emperor's strength. Jahangir probably had much the same message in mind.

European visitors, awed by the court and its ceremony, describe gold, silver and rich textiles ornamenting Jahangir's throne in the Public Audience Hall of the Agra fort. William Hawkins, who resided at court from 1609 to 1611, indicates that two red railings separated the most favored members of the nobility from the slightly less favored and then, in turn, from the lower ranks. Jahangir's own description of his Public Audience Hall at this time concurs with Hawkins'. In 1613 Jahangir decided to differentiate the first railing from the second by covering it with silver; he similarly embellished the steps leading to the *jharoka* and two wooden elephants flanking it, further underscoring the levels of hierarchy within the court.

Persian sources refer to Jahangir's Agra palaces as pillared *aiwans,* or halls, giving no further indication of their appearance. However, references by several European writers, including the Jesuit Father Jerome Xavier, indicate that Christian subject matter embellished the interior of Jahangir's Agra fort palaces. Small renderings of the Virgin and winged angels appear in an illustration belonging to *the Jahangir Nama,* the emperor's memoirs, that depicts an audience scene with the emperor seated in his *jharoka.* These paintings of Christian subjects reflect an awareness of newly arrived western paintings, not any sympathy with Christianity. The Mughal emperors, who fully recognized the significance of these works through close contact with Jesuits and other

**1 1 2**

Europeans, used the imagery to enhance their own semi-divine imperial image.<sup>14</sup>

The only remaining addition made by Jahangir to the Agra fort is an enormous stone basin, 1.5 meters high by 1.2 meters. Dated 1611, the same year Jahangir married the formidable Mehr al-Nisa, later entitled Nur Jahan, this cistern may be associated with the nuptial celebrations. It was probably made as a wine basin similar to the one discussed earlier that Jahangir had carved into the hillside in Kabul.

In 1612 Jahangir mentions his first additions to Akbar's Lahore fort. They were designed by Khwaja Jahan Muhammad Dost, the architect named only one year earlier as the designer of a palace in the Agra fort. At Lahore, work under Jahangir must have begun much earlier, for William Finch, visiting Jahangir's Lahore palaces in 1610, describes these buildings and their interior decoration in detail. Jahangir refers to work at the fort on several occasions, and in 1620, visiting the fort, praises the "charming residences . . . erected in great beauty . . . and embellished with painting by rare artists."<sup>15</sup> One of the buildings to which Jahangir here refers is a small walled courtyard known today as the Maktab Khana, identified as the Daulat Khana-i Jahangiri in its inscription. It was constructed in 1617 under the supervision of Macmur Khan, also known as cAbd al-Karim, an architect associated with other projects of Jahangir and Shah Jahan. Composed of arched chambers around a central courtyard, it is situated on the Public Audience Hall's west side; it served as a large passage from the palace buildings on the north to the Audience Hall. To the west of this courtyard is a small white marble mosque known as the Moti mosque. Although some credit Jahangir for its construction, it is probably Shah Jahan's work.

Among other buildings in the fort generally assigned to Jahangir's patronage are several small flat-roofed rectangular chambers supported by red sandstone pillars (Plate 59). These buildings today are in an area known as the Jahangiri Quadrangle. While their format differs little from Akbar's palaces, the intricate, complex carving of elephant brackets, the pillars, and the screened windows of the northernmost pavilion suggest a date in Jahangir's reign. These features compare favorably to those on the Kanch Mahal in Agra, also probably constructed in Jahangir's reign.

The most important remaining Jahangiri structure in the Lahore fort is the Kala Burj (Plate 60).<sup>16</sup> Although undated, the flattened interior of the dome,

with a net pattern that converges at a stellate medallion center, resembles other Jahangiri vaulting systems, for example, that of the mosque of Maryam al-Zamani (Plate 62) dated 1611. Conservation on the dome has revealed paintings of European-influenced angels and birds - some mythological, others real. They so closely resemble Finch's descriptions of angels in Jahangir's Lahore palaces that this must have been the one he described when visiting the Lahore fort in 1610. Angels painted in the vaults of the palace's dome represent the heavenly retinue of King Solomon, established in the Quran as an ideal ruler and the mythic kingly figure with whom Islamic rulers frequently associate themselves. Indeed, this association between ruler and Solomon is no accident, for, in his sole inscription at the Lahore fort, Jahangir is described as "a Solomon in dignity,"<sup>17</sup> while imagery on the fort's exterior tile work, datable to his reign, alludes to a Solomonic retinue. Included on the tiles are angels, who aid the mythic king Solomon's control of the world by leading jinns, or

spirits, on chains; this is imagery appropriate for a king who equates himself with the glory of Solomon.

The other subjects seen by Finch, that is, portraits of the nobility and princes, each of whom he very carefully identifies, jinns, the Virgin Mary and Jesus no longer remain. These were probably similar to illustrations known to us from smaller-scale works on paper.

Unlike the Agra and Allahabad forts, whose outer walls are made of red stone, the Lahore fort's walls are brick, a traditional building material of the northwestern area of the subcontinent. The north and west exterior brick walls are divided into vertical blocks of arched and paneled areas. The upper panels are decorated with tile mosaics (Plate 61). Commenced under Jahangir, the west wall may have been completed under Shah Jahan; but if so the mosaics were probably done by the same artists, since there is no change in style or technique.<sup>18</sup>

In addition to images of angels, sometimes leading jinns, the tile mosaics on the fort's north and west walls depict a myriad of subjects. Since few tiles remain, it is difficult to determine whether this ornamentation had a specific program. However, it is notable that the large angels either leading jinns or holding a regnal standard, and the Simurgh, a mythical bird long associated

with imperial symbolism as well as with Solomonic imagery, are situated in spandrels above arched openings.

## *The city under Jahangir*

## *Lahore*

Just outside the fort is the mosque of the queen mother, Maryam al-Zamani, the city's oldest surviving Mughal mosque. Located near the fort's Akbar-period Masti gate, this mosque was probably built as the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque for those attending court. It was not provided by the emperor, but its construction doubtless met Jahangir's approval and commenced a Mughal tradition whereby important court ladies provided the major mosques in imperial cities. Known as the Begum Shahi mosque and the mosque of Maryam al-Zamani, it was built in 1611-12. The mosque originally was entered by three handsome gateways, though only two remain, each bearing historical inscriptions. The gates provide access to a large walled courtyard before the prayer chamber, whose east facade is pierced by five arched entrances, the central one within a high *pishtaq.* Thus the mosque's exterior form belongs to a type long popular in Indo-Islamic architecture. The brick core is covered with a plaster veneer which originally bore painted ornament.

![](_page_18_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 62. Interior dome, Maryam al-Zamani's mosque, also known as the Begum Shahi mosque, Lahore

Although the interior of the prayer chamber follows a form once associated with Afghan builders - and now a common Mughal one: a single-aisled rectangular space divided into five bays - the interior decor established trends for the later Mughal buildings of Lahore. At the center of the main dome (Plate 62) is a medallion with radiating stellate and net forms rendered in stucco, completing the exquisite decor of the domes. Similar forms are seen in subsequent Mughal architecture. Also anticipating later works is the treatment of the mosque's vaulting, brilliantly painted as are the walls. Unlike the secular wall painting on Jahangir's palaces and garden pavilions, here, in keeping with the aniconic tendencies of Islamic religious art, the patterns are largely floral and geometric, while the names of God are inscribed within stars on the dome. Cypress trees and wine vessels are the only representational objects depicted, but they are symbols of the divine. They are usually associated with later tombs, but their presence here indicates the adoption of this Iranian motif much earlier than generally assumed.

Maryam al-Zamani died in Agra in 1623. There is no mention of the construction of a tomb for her in contemporary texts; however, tradition holds that Jahangir converted for her tomb a *baradari* in Sikandra not far from Akbar's tomb. It is believed to have been initially constructed in the early sixteenth

**" 7**

century by the Lodis. Reusing an older building as a tomb for such an important member of the imperial family is not within Mughal tradition. Thus, if the structure is correctly identified, it was surely newly constructed. Indeed, the tomb adheres to Mughal funereal forms, for its exterior resembles closely the plinth of Humayun's tomb (Plate 18), while the multi-chambered interior is typically Mughal.

About 2.5 km from the Lahore fort is an octagonal structure known as Anarkali's tomb. She was probably one of Jahangir's wives. Its magnificently carved cenotaph is inscribed with the phrase "the profoundly enamored Salim, son of Akbar" and the dates 1599 and 1612.<sup>19</sup> This probably indicates the year of her death and the tomb's completion.

This octagonal mausoleum, originally situated in a four-part garden, has several features that depart from those of other imperial tombs. Among these are the arched opening marking each facade and the semi-engaged octagonal turret at each of the eight junctures. The interior, however, follows the familiar plan used for tombs: a central domed chamber is surrounded by smaller ones. Its marble cenotaph carved with floral arabesques and the ninety-nine names of God inlaid in black stone is close in ornamentation to the near-contemporary cenotaph on the upper story of Akbar's tomb.

#### Ajmer

In 1613 Jahangir left Agra for Ajmer in order to conduct a vigorous campaign against Rana Amar Singh of Mewar, one of his most formidable opponents. Two events especially pleased Jahangir during his three years in Ajmer. One was visiting the shrine of Mucin al-Din Chishti; the second was the defeat and submission of Rana Amar Singh in 1615. His resulting enthusiasm for the city appears to have colored favorably much of Jahangir's attitude toward architecture - be it pre-existing or newly created - in the environs of Ajmer.

An auspicious moment was chosen for the emperor's entrance into the city. He immediately proceeded to the Chishti *dargah* on foot, thus re-enacting the pilgrimage to this esteemed shrine that Akbar had performed annually until 1579. En route money was distributed to the poor and pious. Jahangir writes that, during his nearly three-year stay in Ajmer, he visited the shrine nine times. Four paintings illustrating these visits are known, suggesting the importance that the shrine held for Jahangir.

During one visit to this shrine in 1614, Jahangir donated an enormous cauldron ( $dig$ ), made in Agra, that could feed 5,000 needy people. It no longer remains. Akbar earlier had donated a similar vessel at this shrine,<sup>20</sup> suggesting

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>19</sup> Muhammad Baqir, *Lahore, Past and Present* (Lahore, 1952), pp. 414–17.

 <sup>&</sup>lt;sup>20</sup> See the Persian text in S. A. I. Tirmizi, *Ajmer through Inscriptions* (1532-1852 A.D.) (New Delhi, 1968), p. 17, for the English translation in al-Badayuni, *Muntakhab al-Tawarikh*, II: 108, is not clear

that this act had dynastic significance. During the course of a worrisome illness later in the same year, the emperor paid homage to the shrine. After his recovery, Jahangir began wearing pearl earrings as a sign of devotion to the Chishti saint. This custom was quickly adopted by his courtiers. In 1615, on the occasion of the saint's cUrs, the annual remembrance of the saint's death, the emperor personally distributed money and other material rewards; this event was illustrated for the *Jahangir Nama.* His major material donation to the shrine was a "gold railing with lattice work" that was installed around the tomb of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din in 1616,21 but taken in eighteenth-century raids. Jahangir states that the railing was donated in fulfillment of certain vows, but leaves their exact nature unclear. Another painting for the *Jahangir Nama* illustrating the railing's installation includes Prince Khurram, the future Shah Jahan, and the military commander in the campaign against the rana of Mewar, standing with Jahangir at the tomb's entrance.<sup>22</sup> Thus one of Jahangir's vows may have been the successful subjugation of Mewar. While this is the emperor's last specific reference to the shrine, in 1623 Jahangir dispatched Habash Khan to repair buildings in Ajmer, possibly including ones at the *dargah.*

With the exception of the gold railing, Jahangir's donations to the shrine consisted of food and alms, items whose value was most immediately felt by the pious and needy. Just as Akbar's interests in the shrine had stimulated increased patronage on a sub-imperial level, so, as we shall see, the same was true during Jahangir's reign.

His sincere devotion to the Chishti saint notwithstanding, Jahangir was in Ajmer to complete successfully the on-going Mughal campaign against the ranas of Mewar. Their unwillingness to submit to Mughal authority had been a source of immense concern. Thus Jahangir celebrated his victory by some harsh acts - generally idolatrous and certainly disrespectful to local tradition all clearly directed at the ranas of Mewar. For example, Jahangir violated local order by hunting on the banks of the sacred tank at Pushkar, on the outskirts of Ajmer. While at Pushkar, Jahangir visited some of the Hindu temples surrounding the tank, and, upon seeing an image of Varaha, the Boar incarnation of Vishnu, ordered that it be destroyed and thrown into the tank. Worshiping a deity in the form of a pig, considered unclean in Islam, was repulsive to Jahangir. But he desecrated the image because the temple in which it had been installed belonged to an uncle of Rana Amar of Mewar, Jahangir's arch enemy. Later, in 1620, when Jahangir became the first Muslim ruler to conquer the Kangra valley, he did similar things. Again, not out of religious sentiment but for a show of strength, he slaughtered a bullock within the fort's walls and erected a mosque as well as other Mughal-style buildings in the vicinity.<sup>23</sup>

Plate 63. Hunting pavilion, Pushkar

Jahangir notes simply that the ruling power was now the Mughals, a Muslim state; Hindu subjects were not in any way persecuted or harassed.

In 1615–16 Jahangir constructed a small hunting palace on the banks of the Pushkar tank (Plate 63). The inscription there states that its buildings were erected in celebration of Jahangir's victory over the rana only a short time earlier. Hence imperial Mughal presence was made permanent on the shores of a sacred Hindu spot (tirtha). The impact of Mughal authority on the Hindu devotees coming on pilgrimage to this site, considered one of the holiest of all tirthas, a locale where nothing was to be killed, would have been powerful indeed. Jahangir, who loved hunting on these shores, visited the Pushkar palace fifteen times during his residence at Ajmer.

Situated at the edge of the tank in an area away from the temples that line the water's banks, this hunting pavilion today is largely in ruins. Even in this condition it is possible to see that the overall appearance of the buildings lacks the refinement and elegance of those in his Jahangiri Quadrangle at the Lahore fort (Plate 59). Only two of the original three small pavilions remain on the elevated rectangular plinth. These nearly identical structures, located at the plinth's east and west ends, face each other. Constructed from a brown-colored stone, each consists of a single flat-roofed chamber surrounded on the front and sides by a deep veranda supported on squat polygonal columns. This

Plate 64. Pavilion, upper terrace, Chesma-i Nur, Ajmer

trabeated palace, basically modeled on traditional Mughal prototypes, probably relied on local labor, thus explaining its unrefined appearance.

In the vicinity of Ajmer, Jahangir most loved a small palace he constructed in 1615. He named it Chesma-i Nur, or Fountain of Light, after himself, Nur al-Din Jahangir. Situated in a picturesque valley on the west side of Taragarh hill, Jahangir visited the Chesma-i Nur thirty-eight times during his three years in Ajmer. He laments that it was far from the city and could only be visited on the weekends. Thomas Roe, at the palace in 1616, recounts the rigorous journey to reach it. Jahangir describes the palace as having a square tank and a high-shooting fountain with lovely buildings situated at the fountain's edge. The chambers were painted by master artists, although Jahangir does not mention any subjects illustrated.

Roe similarly describes the Chesma-i Nur. Today it is sadly ruined, but the tank remains as do some buildings on two levels around it. The upper level of the palace consists of stone pillared pavilions (Plate 64) constructed on either side of a stone stream bed. They face each other as do those at the Pushkar pavilion. The stream cascaded to the lower level, where an arched and vaulted chamber (Plate 65), created in part from the natural rock, was built adjacent to the square tank into which the cooling waters fell. On its arched facade is an inscription designed by the scribe cAbd Allah, known earlier for his work on

#### **1 2 1**

the Allahabad pillar and Shah Begum's tomb. Although these buildings were overall more elegant than those erected concurrently at Pushkar, it is the setting that makes them spectacular. Considering Jahangir's concern with any structure's total environment, it is hardly surprising that this was among his favorite dwellings.

Jahangir mentions two large tanks in the city of Ajmer. The Visal Sar, the smaller of the two, had been in a ruined condition, and in 1616 Jahangir repaired it. He especially loved the larger tank, the Ana Sagar, which is nearly 13 km in circumference and with its waves appears like a veritable lake. Jahangir describes how he spent the night with the palace ladies on this tank's lamp-lit banks. He makes no mention of construction on its banks, but an official chronicler of Shah Jahan's reign indicates that Jahangir built marble pavilions there. While the white marble pavilions on the banks of the Ana Sagar (Plate 104) are generally attributed to Shah Jahan, Jahangir's son and successor, they may have been started by Jahangir. The ruins of other structures, still visible at the west end of the adjoining park, are the only remaining part of Daulat Bagh, a garden credited to Jahangir.

## *Mandu*

In 1615 Jahangir moved to Mandu, the major hill fortress in Malwa, an area of west-central India. He wanted to be closer to the Deccan, where Mughal campaigns had been suffering setbacks for some time. Ahead of him he sent c Abd al-Karim, later associated with buildings in the Lahore fort. In this hill fort, the capital of the former sultans of Malwa, the architect was charged with repairing old palace buildings and with constructing new ones. Jahangir and the imperial entourage departed from Ajmer in November 1616, reaching Mandu about four months later. During the journey, the emperor hunted daily, taking time to explore and even repair buildings along the way. For example, near Ujjain he restored the mansion of Nasir al-Din Khalji, an earlier sultan of Mandu, piping water into gardens and fountains. Reaching Mandu in early 1617, Jahangir was delighted with the fort, its setting and climate. cAbd al-Karim's restorations there as well as his new construction so pleased the emperor that he increased the architect's rank and rewarded him with the title Ma<sup>c</sup> mur Khan. Buildings such as the so-called Gada's house in the Mandu fort and the Taweli Mahal appear to be products of Mughal restoration or construction, although they cannot be attributed with certainty to Ma<sup>c</sup> mur Khan, since the fort had been used under Akbar and Humayun and was subsequently used by Shah Jahan as well. Probably more restoration than new construction was carried out. For example, Jahangir's description of a banquet at Nur Jahan's palaces indicates that she occupied structures around the so-called Jahaz Mahal and the surrounding tanks, structures built previously by the sultans of Mandu. Further evidence of Jahangir's admiration for the buildings

## PATRONAGE OF THE EMPEROR AND EMPRESS

Plate 65. Pavilion, lower terrace, Chesma-i Nur, Ajmer

of the Mandu sultans is his favorable descriptions of the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque of Mandu, the tombs of the early kings, and their palaces, especially the Haft Manazil. Included in his praise is the Nil-Kanth palace, constructed during Akbar's reign in 1574.

## *Architecture of pleasure: gardens and hunting pavilions*

In 1619 Jahangir returned to Agra after a five-year absence. There he once again found greatest delight in the mansions and gardens of his highest-ranking nobles and those of his wife, Nur Jahan. Jahangir was highly pleased with his Gul Afshan garden, probably the same garden later owned by Nur Jahan and renamed the Nur Afshan Bagh. But at this time Jahangir clearly regarded it his own project, for he personally rewarded the architect, Khwaja Jahan, by increasing his rank. This is yet another indication of the emperor's regard for architects and garden settings. The Nur Manazil garden, also in Agra, was well under way about the time of the emperor's return to the city and appears to be another of Khwaja Jahan's designs.24 Delighted with its appearance, Jahangir

*Tuzuk,* 11: 76-77. It is not stated specifically that Khwaja Jahan is this garden's designer, but the context suggests this is the case.

describes a large walled garden with richly embellished dwellings, water basins, canals and planted plots. The emperor mentions that a large sum had already been expended on the project and more was to be spent. Clearly this was done, for later he mentions this garden as an entertainment site.

In Kashmir's capital city, Srinagar, Akbar had constructed a massive fort on a high hill known as the Koh-i Maran or Hari Parbat overlooking Dal lake. There Jahangir ordered the completion of the unfinished portion of the fortifications and the restoration of the palace buildings in it, especially a garden and Public Audience Hall. Muc tamad Khan was charged with this work. He created a three-tiered garden. There he had its pavilion embellished with the work of master painters, as was done at Jahangir's palaces in Ajmer, Agra and Lahore. Again, in keeping with many of his earlier works, Jahangir renamed this garden Nur Afza, Light Increasing, after himself, continuing his long-standing fascination with light imagery.

The banks of Srinagar's Dal lake are famed for their magnificent Mughal gardens. Although Jahangir visited Kashmir more times than any other Mughal ruler, his role in the construction of the gardens around Dal lake is less clear. However, in 1620 Jahangir ordered his son, the prince Shah Jahan, to block up the stream in an area known as Shalimar, near the banks of Dal lake. While the choice of the setting was Jahangir's, the garden is Shahjahan's (Plate 129). This world-famous garden will be discussed in the next chapter.

Jahangir gave special attention to gardens in the valley south of Srinagar. He loved the natural streams and springs, and so added to them canals, fountains and buildings to create terraced gardens. At Loka Bhavan, some 40 km south of Srinagar, Jahangir ordered the restoration of the reservoir in front of the springs, indicating that he was not the spring's first patron, and constructed a new building there. In fact, few of these gardens are the result of a single patron. In close proximity to Loka Bhavan are the springs of Macchi Bhavan and Inch. Here the patronage was not imperial but that of high-ranking Hindu nobles; Jahangir describes Ram Das Kachhwaha's Macchi Bhavan garden and spring with crystal clear waters, large fish and splendid trees beautiful beyond words. It seems likely that imperial example stimulated the construction of the numerous gardens through this valley.

About 8 km north of Loka Bhavan are the natural spring and waterfall of Achibal (Plate *66).* Jahangir describes its water, magnificent trees and enchanting pavilions. He notes a garden with beautiful flowers, not necessarily one he constructed. Although the garden later was associated with Jahan Ara, Shah Jahan's favorite daughter, its appearance was probably established by Jahangir's time. At the summit of the terraced garden is the natural spring which still today is gathered in a large pool that is dammed so that water pressure produces a powerfully impressive waterfall gushing into lower terraced canals. The water chutes, carved to resemble rushing water, are of

Plate *66.* Garden, Achibal

Mughal origin as are the pavilion bases; however, the pavilions' superstructures, as in most Mughal gardens, are more recently constructed. Achibal, more than any other Mughal garden, preserves the natural beauty of the falls and dense foliage, set against the towering hills.

The site in Kashmir most often mentioned by Jahangir is the spring at Vernag (Plate 67), about 10 km north of Achibal. When still a prince Jahangir visited Vernag twice. Then the crystal clear waters of the spring, the source of the powerful Jhelum river, were contained within an octagonal reservoir with cells nearby for recluses. In 1606 Jahangir ordered that the sides of the spring be faced with stone and that a garden, canal and splendid edifices be constructed. However, both epigraphical and literary sources indicate that they were not completed until his fifteenth regnal year, 1619-20. Even then, the canal and its watercourses were not fully finished, for a second inscription, dated 1626-27, describes the construction of a water course and cascade by the architect Haider. While much of the garden and surrounding pavilions have disappeared, the tank, with low walls containing arched apertures and blind arched niches, still exists as do descendants of the large fish that swim in the lucid waters, creating a spectacle of royal splendor.

Jahangir twice mentions a tower, tank and pavilion used as a hunting palace about 29 km from Lahore. Today the site is known as Sheikhupura, but

![](_page_27_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate *6y.* Pool, Vernag

Jahangir in 1606 refers to it as Jahangirpura and then in 1620 calls it Jahangirabad, both meaning City of Jahangir, the latter a more Persianate form. Here the emperor's favorite tame antelope died before 1606; it was buried in a grave above which a sculpted antelope and eulogy written by Mulla Muhammad Husain of Kashmir were placed. Adjacent to this gravestone, a tower was constructed around 1606 (Plate 68) under the supervision of Sikandar Mu<sup>c</sup> in Khan, the landholder of the area. On Jahangir's orders, Sikandar Mu<sup>c</sup> in Khan also built a tank and royal residence. Despite Mu<sup>c</sup> in's death while the work was in progress, the complex was handsomely completed by 1620, the later stages of construction having been supervised by Iradat Khan. The expenses incurred were sufficiently awesome that the emperor recorded the amount in his memoirs. Jahangir considered the site a "kingly hunting place,"<sup>25</sup> although his successor found the place inadequate and in 1634 spent another sizable sum rebuilding the pavilion.

The tank, tower and pavilion are well preserved. Situated to the west of the tank, the tower resembles closely the plan and elevation the so-called Hiran Minar at Fatehpur Sikri and the Nim Serai Minar at Malda, both datable to Akbar's reign (Plates 27 and 53). Built about 1606, the Sheikhupura tower belongs to the very early part of Jahangir's reign; hence, the close resemblance

#### 25 *Tuzuk,* 11: 182.

# PATRONAGE OF THE EMPEROR AND EMPRESS

![](_page_28_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 68. Tower, Sheikhupura

to Akbari prototypes is not surprising. Missing are the tusk-like projections around the sides, but holes that would have accommodated them remain. The tower's brick fabric was originally covered with a thick stucco veneer which retained traces of red, yellow and green polychrome until recently, when it was plastered anew. The tower sits on an octagonal base and was possibly used as an observation post for hunting. Aligned with the tower is a three-storied octagonal pavilion situated in the center of a large square tank. The tank was constructed in Jahangir's reign, but the three-storied octagonal pavilion in its current state is a product of Shah Jahan's patronage (Plate 128).

## *Nurjahan 's patronage*

Jahangir married the widow Nurjahan in 1611, although his writings do not mention her until 1614. She quickly overshadowed Jahangir's other wives and assumed an unprecedented role in courtly and political life. Nur Jahan, her father, I<sup>c</sup> timad al-Daula, and her brother, Asaf Khan, formed a powerful triumvirate and essentially controlled the state. By the end of Jahangir's reign, when the emperor was incapacitated by failing health, Nur Jahan was the

I 2 7

virtual ruler. Jahangir himself acknowledged her ability and legitimized her power. He made her Finance Minister after the death of the previous minister, her father. Coins were even minted in her name, an honor otherwise reserved for the emperor. While the powerful queen was deeply appreciated by Jahangir, other factions viewed her less favorably, ultimately creating schisms within the state. Much of this factionalism was contained until late 1621, when I<sup>c</sup> timad al-Daula, a stabilizing force, died. Because Nur Jahan championed her son-inlaw, Shahriyar, as Jahangir's heir apparent, the eldest prince, Shah Jahan, revolted. She nevertheless maintained control until Jahangir's death in 1627, thereafter residing quietly in Lahore until her death in 1645.

Not only interested in politics, Nur Jahan is famed for her impact on culture. She invented a rose perfume, fashioned clothing styles, created new carpet designs, and wrote poetry. Her patronage of architecture is well established although rarely mentioned in contemporary texts. It is better known from inscriptions and the writings of European travelers.

According to Francisco Pelsaert, a European residing in India during the height of Nur Jahan's power, the queen constructed pleasure gardens, palaces and serais throughout the land in order to enhance her image and reputation. He further indicates that she built for financial gain. For example, her serai just outside of Agra, situated at the end of the lucrative Patna-Agra trade route, gave the queen complete control over tariffs levied on goods coming from eastern India into Agra and further north. Without these goods, he notes, the country soon would starve. The serai, no longer extant, covered a large area on the east bank of the Jumna; on its outskirts were the tomb of I<sup>c</sup> timad al-Daula and several gardens, including the Nur Afshan garden, both products of the queen's patronage. Thus most of the river frontage on the Jumna's east bank probably was under the empress' control. Peter Mundy, who stayed twice in this serai, describes it as a handsome stone structure with arched and domed chambers capable of housing 2,000 to 3,000 people and 500 horses.

Although the Agra serai no longer exists, another constructed by her, known as Serai Nur Mahal (Plate *69),* stands in a town of the same name in Jalandhar District, Punjab. Inscriptions on the serai indicate that it was commenced in 1618-19 and completed two years later. Jahangir records that he stayed in this serai in 1621 and was splendidly entertained by his queen there. Serai Nur Mahal was commenced about the time that Jahangir had issued orders for *kos minar* to be constructed from Agra through the Punjab and for the repair of the road between Kashmir and Agra. One of many serais along this road, Serai Nur Mahal with its carved red sandstone gates was especially impressive. Its enclosure walls contained 124 chambers and a mosque. In the center of the south wall was a three-storied royal apartment, originally painted, probably with motifs similar to those in Jahangir's Lahore fort (Plate 60) and the queen's Nur Afshan garden in Agra. Among Mughal serais this one is

## PATRONAGE OF THE EMPEROR AND EMPRESS

![](_page_30_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 69. Serai Nur Mahal, Serai Nur Mahal

unusually handsome, not surprising considering Nur Jahan's resources and taste.

Among the many gardens credited to Nur Jahan is her Bagh-i Nur Afshan in Agra, known today as the Ram Bagh. It was probably constructed on the site of Babur's Gul Afshan, or Flower Scattering Garden. By 1621 the name apparently had been changed to Bagh-i Nur Afshan, Light-Scattering Garden, once again using light imagery while playing upon the imperial names.

This *char bagh* is terraced and laid out with stone water courses. Originally the garden, like all Mughal gardens, was planted with cypress trees, small groves of fruit trees and flowers. Although the current planting of the Bagh-i Nur Afshan little resembles the original layout, portions of the channels, tanks and pavilions remain.

At the top of the terrace overlooking the river Jumna are two similar pavilions that face one another (Plate 70), an arrangement seen earlier at Pushkar and Chesma-i Nur. Between them is a large sunken tank and stairs leading to vaulted chambers below. Each rectangular pavilion is composed of three sections of pillared *aiwans* that alternate with two flat-roofed enclosed chambers. Although largely white-washed, portions of the interior painted

vaulting have been restored. Within net vault forms are painted birds, angels, a Simurgh and floral designs, all related to Solomonic imagery appropriate for royalty and similar to that within Jahangir's Kala Burj in the Lahore fort (Plate 60). Traces of paintings, including one of a courtly lady that is Europeaninfluenced, also remain on the exterior walls. According to Mundy and others, European-influenced painting was common on the walls of similar pavilions.

Today the best preserved of all Nur Jahan's architectural projects is the tomb she constructed for her parents in Agra (Plate 71). This white marble mausoleum is known as the tomb of I<sup>c</sup> timad al-Daula, although both Nur Jahan's mother, Asmat Begum, who died in 1621, and her father, who died in the same year, are buried there. Nur Jahan, who genuinely was devoted to her parents, spent vast sums on its construction. The tomb was completed about six years after their death as indicated by inscriptions dated 1626-27 and 1627-28 that were written by the scribe cAbd al-Nabi al-Quraishi.

Situated on the river bank, the tomb is a small two-storied marble structure in the center of a *char bagh* about 165 meters square. It is approached by road from the east through a red sandstone gate; a gate on the west serves as the river entrance. This multi-storied western entrance is conceived as a pleasure pavilion with spacious interior chambers and arched openings overlooking the river. Similar sandstone structures, not actual entrances, are on the north and

south sides. On all four, the red stone is inlaid with white marble, a typical Mughal device.

The white marble tomb, about 7 meters per side, is magnificently crafted and profusely inlaid with semi-precious stones. Resting on a low red sandstone plinth, the tomb's first story is marked at each corner by an engaged octagonal turret. On each side is a single arched portal flanked by screened openings for illumination. The interior is divided into nine bays, recalling in concept the arrangement of Humayun's tomb. However, unlike the radial plan based on an octagon found at Humayun's tomb, here eight rooms, two on each side, hug the central vaulted chamber. This plan is seen earlier at Akbar's Ajmer palace, and derives in its Indo-Islamic context from palace structures. The walls of all these rooms are richly painted with flowers, vases, cypresses and wine vessels, but the central chamber, containing two stone cenotaphs, is the most lavishly embellished. The ceiling's richly polychromed net vaulting and stellate forms are a more refined version of those at Maryam al-Zamani's mosque (Plate 62), built early in Jahangir's reign.26

> 26 Koch, "Jahangir and the Angels," 176.

The second or top story is marked at each corner by a *chattri-topped* turret. In the center is a single chamber, surmounted by a truncated pyramidal vault. Intricately carved pierced screens, modeled on those at Shaikh Salim Chishti's tomb, essentially form the walls.

Semi-precious stones are profusely inlaid into the white marble of the tomb's exterior as well as in the interior of the second story. Most believe that this *pietra dura* technique - that is, design rendered by the inlay of hard precious stones into marble — was introduced from Europe in the seventeenth century; others maintain that this technique developed independently without western stimulation. Regardless of the technique's origin, in India only on Mughal architecture is it used as a major source of decoration.

Inlay forming designs similar to those on the gateway to Akbar's tomb, where they are executed in less precious stones, cover the first story's exterior. On the upper story there are wine vessels, fruit and cypress trees (Plate 72). These forms, drawn from Persian poetry, were long known in Indo-Islamic culture, but their depiction on Mughal architecture probably derives from Safavid sources. For example, there are wine vessels in the ceiling of the cAli Kapu, the entrance to Shah cAbbas' palace in Isfahan built about the turn of the seventeenth century. Such motifs appear in India first on Jahangir-period architecture, for example on the mosque of Maryam al-Zamani in Lahore. Since I c timad al-Daula and his family come from Safavid Iran, the use of these motifs is particularly appropriate. At this time, many artists from the Safavid court immigrated to Mughal India.

While Safavid in origin, these forms serve as symbols of paradise and the divine. For example, fruit is a promised commodity of paradise in numerous Quranic verses, thus appropriate for funereal imagery. Although the consumption of wine is forbidden in Islam, the promised nectar in paradise according to the Quran will be a pure wine that gives neither inebriation nor headache. In addition, wine and the consumption of wine in Persian mystical poetry is used as a metaphor for spiritual intoxication resulting from the intense feeling of love for the beloved, who on the most profound level is God. The cypress tree in mystical poetry is yet another reference to God. In lieu of literary inscriptions inviting one to paradise, as on the entrance to Akbar's tomb, here the concept of paradise is enhanced by using expensive materials and visual devices to suggest that the heavenly abode of the deceased royal noble will surpass even his earthly abode.

Although the tomb is commonly described as Safavid influenced, this only pertains to the choice of decorative motifs. The overall appearance of the tomb is wholly Indian, recalling, for example, the exterior of Akbar's Diwan-i Khass at Fatehpur Sikri (Plate 31). Ic timad al-Daula's tomb, like Akbar's (Plate 56), belongs to the type based on contemporary palace pavilions.

The intricately carved marble screens of the top floor (Plate 73), similar to

Plate 72. Detail of inlay, I<sup>c</sup> timad al-Daula's tomb, Agra

those on Shaikh Salim Chishti's tomb (Plate 26), allow light to flood the room, making it appear to dissolve. Given the imperial Mughal fascination with light and in particular Nur Jahan's and Jahangir's obsession with light imagery, the manipulation of light here seems intentional. Light was more than an imperial symbol. For the Mughals, it also served as a metaphor for Divine Light, symbolizing the very presence of God. This play of light upon the solid marble of the room may be intended as a reminder that only God, here symbolized by light, is real - all other is illusion.

In contrast to the chamber's light-flooded elevation are the sinuous arabesques and floral motifs formed from yellow and brown semi-precious stones inlaid into the white marble floor. This recalls the design of expensive carpets, such as those depicted in contemporary court paintings, for example, one at Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din's shrine in Ajmer illustrated for the *Jahangir Nama.* Here again is an instance where the most coveted forms from temporal life are used to depict the luxury anticipated in paradise.

### *Western India*

#### *Ajmer and vicinity*

Roe, writing in January 1616, noted that in Ajmer the nobility resided in tents since there was only one stone-constructed residence there - that of the king all others being mud-built. Not much later, however, the nobility must have built stone dwellings, for Mundy, who visited Ajmer in 1633, states that the housing constructed by Jahangir's court was already in ruins.

In Ajmer, as elsewhere, Jahangir's presence stimulated building by others. This is particularly so at the Chishti shrines of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din and Khwaja Sayyid Husain Khing Sawar. Concurrent with Jahangir's presence in Ajmer inscribed gates, graves and ancillary buildings were constructed at each shrine. The most significant material contribution was I<sup>c</sup> tibar Khan's lattice railing provided in 1615 around the grave of Husain Khing Sawar. It was given in celebration of Jahangir's victory over the rana of Mewar. Jahangir a year later donated a gold railing to the Chishti shrine below, almost certainly for this same reason, perhaps in a curious reversal deriving his inspiration from sub-imperial patronage.

Patronage in Rajasthan was not limited to shrines. For example, in 1615 Gajhast Khan, Jahangir's supervisor of elephant stables, constructed a step-well in Gangwana, close to Ajmer. Carved at the bottom of the inscriptional slab is an elephant and prodding implements, emblems appropriate for his position. In the same year Nawab Daulat Khan provided additions to a palace he had commenced during Akbar's reign in Fatehpur, Shekhawati District. Jahangir's mother, Maryam al-Zamani, built a serai and well near Bayana in 1613-14. Lying on the Fatehpur Sikri-Ajmer route in an important indigo growing center, it accommodated both Jahangir and the traveler Finch. Nobles built mosques during this period at Merta, Hindaun and Jalor, and an cIdgah (a mosque intended especially for the annual cId celebrations) was constructed in 1613 at Bairat, in the ancestral lands of Raja Man Singh. With the exception of Jalor, situated on the Surat-Ajmer trade route, all these works were constructed in a region between Agra and Ajmer, then under firm control of the Mughals.

#### *Ahmadabad*

Ahmadabad remained the primary city of Gujarat under the Mughals just as it had been under the independent sultans of Gujarat. During Jahangir's reign, both gardens and mansions were built, although few of these survive in their original condition. The garden and palace (Plates 74-75) that the prince Shah Jahan constructed for himself is today used as a museum and known as the

## PATRONAGE OF PRINCES AND NOBILITY

![](_page_36_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 73. Interior top story, I<sup>c</sup> timad al-Daula's tomb, Agra

Moti Bagh. Built during the prince's tenure as governor there between *1616* and 1623, it was known then as Shahi Bagh (Princely Garden). Jahangir, who admired this residence, had a marble seat built in its garden. A European visiting Ahmadabad in 1638 praised the gardens, its reservoirs and the palace as unusually lovely. This is not surprising, for its patron, Shah Jahan, would become the greatest Mughal patron of architecture. Shah Jahan's palace is characteristic of contemporary Mughal architecture. The exterior is a twostoried trabeated structure with a delicate pillared entrance, essentially a more refined version of Akbar's Ajmer palace (Plate 20). It contains vaulted subterranean rooms with water cascades for protection from the summer's heat. The ground floor is similar in plan to many Mughal-period mansions. There is a large square central chamber surrounded by eight smaller ones. These rooms are covered by stucco vaulted ceilings embellished with delicate net patterning. According to an eighteenth-century visitor, the rooms were finished with a highly burnished *chuna* and tastefully painted.

Although other gardens and palaces were built by nobles in Ahmadabad, hardly any survive. Rather, religious structures are best preserved because they

![](_page_37_Figure_0.jpeg)

![](_page_37_Figure_1.jpeg)

Plate 74. Plan of Shahi Bagh, today known as the Moti Bagh, Ahmadabad

had a popular and continuing base of support. This may be seen with the architecture of Shaikh Farid Bukhari, entitled Murtaza Khan, who was Jahangir's governor of Gujarat from *1606* to 1609. Known for his patronage throughout the Mughal domain, he established in Ahmadabad a quarter known as Bukhari, after himself, and built administrative buildings in the city; none of these remains. Still standing, however, is the tomb he constructed for Shaikh Wajih al-Din (Plate *j6),* who had died in 1598. Shaikh Wajih al-Din was a disciple of Muhammad Ghaus, who had resided in Gujarat and whose tomb in Gwalior was discussed in the previous chapter. When governor, Shaikh Farid Bukhari built Wajih al-Din's tomb. It is a large stone structure whose interior is divided into eighteen bays. Small domes surmount the roof; over the saint's

![](_page_38_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 75. Shahi Bagh, Ahmadabad

grave is a bulbous dome resting on a high constricted neck, recalling the shape of the dome on Ataga Khan's tomb in Delhi (Plate 16). The screens that comprise the walls are small square panels emulating those at the nearby shrine of Sarkhej that later Jahangir greatly admired. Thus the tomb reflects pan-Mughal and regional traditions.

### *North India*

### *Lahore and the road to Delhi*

During Jahangir's reign, Lahore, Delhi and Agra remained the primary cities in north India. They lay along the route to Kashmir, the imperial pleasure grounds, as well as on the road to Kabul and Qandahar further to the northwest. This was territory that Jahangir, because of his Timurid heritage, believed was rightfully his, even though by the end of his reign it was no longer Mughal. Just as Jahangir and Nur Jahan built in cities along these routes, so did other members of the Mughal house and the nobility.

Under Jahangir, Lahore gained increasing prominence. European visitors describe Lahore as one of the great cities of the east. Included among the subimperial structures they mention are the *char bagh* of Asaf Khan, the mosque of Shaikh Farid Bukhari, a serai and a great bazaar, none of them surviving.

On the road from Lahore to Kashmir, Jahangir ordered his nobles to build

Plate *j6.* Tomb of Shaikh Wajih al-Din, Ahmadabad

serais because it was too cold to stay in tents.<sup>27</sup> Similarly, the road from Lahore to Agra was lined with serais. Many of them were constructed in response to Jahangir's accession orders demanding that serais and wells be constructed in the hinterlands. Beside the empress' Serai Nur Mahal (Plate *69),* already discussed, others were in regular use. Finch, writing in 1610, mentions many serais, including one at Sirhind with a tank and pleasure pavilion in the middle and another under construction by Jahangir at Fatehpur to celebrate his defeat of Khusrau. Others traveling later in the century state that beautiful serais were built about every 20 km by great men or the king to enhance the road, to glorify the patron's name and to ensure the safety of travelers.<sup>28</sup>

One of the best preserved serais of Jahangir's time on the Lahore-Delhi route is Serai Doraha (Plate 77) in the Punjab between Serai Nur Mahal and Sirhind. Constructed of brick, a medium typical of this region, the serai covers a square of about 168 meters. Within the walls are the remains of a *hammam.* A domed mosque, originally covered with paintings, is situated in the serai's

center. The north and south brick entrance gates remain the most striking portions of the serai. Each facade is pierced with a large recessed entrance arch that is framed with a rectangular band of glazed tile-work, also typical of this region.

The Doraha serai bears no inscription, but on the basis of stylistic and literary evidence it is datable to about 1610. The gates' geometric tile decoration resembles closely that on the nearby octagonal tomb built in 1612-13 at Nakodar. Moreover, in 1611 and 1615 travelers mention Doraha as a halting place, suggesting that it was ready for use as early as 1611. Later it was known as I<sup>c</sup> timad al-Daula serai, indicating that this powerful figure may have been the patron. Doraha was part of his landholding.<sup>29</sup>

Although serais directly facilitated trade and travel and so were a highly significant architectural form, many other structures in the area between Delhi and Lahore result from sub-imperial patronage. At Nakodar, for example, is a tomb consistent with contemporary courtly taste (Plate 78). Dated 1612—13, this octagonal tomb was built for Muhammad Mumin Husaini, a musician in the court of cAbd al-Rahim Khan-i Khanan, who was a very high-ranking noble under Akbar and Jahangir. It is constructed of brick and embellished

<sup>29</sup> Wayne E. Begley, "Four Mughal Caravanserais Built during the Reigns of Jahangir and Shah Jahan,' *Muqarnas,* i, 1983, 172.

with glazed tiles inlaid in geometric patterns, materials and designs typical of Mughal architecture of this region. Even the plan anticipates evolving Mughal taste, for it is not a regular octagon but a type known as Baghdadi octagon, that is, with four sides longer than the intermediate ones. Here the larger sides bear deeply recessed arches flanked by shallow arched niches, while the alternating smaller ones are marked by two vertically arranged arches. A Timund building type, the Baghdadi octagon had been used in the early Mughal period, for example at the Delhi Sabz Burj. It is seen increasingly in Jahangir's, but especially in Shah Jahan's reign.

Some structures, however, continue to follow older patterns, but generally they were constructed by little-known subjects, not high-ranking nobles, who more often than not followed and perpetuated contemporary Mughal taste. At Jhajjar, for example, several tombs built between 1611 and 1625 are in the form of pillared *chattris* similar to ones built here in Akbar's time. Others are small square tombs reminiscent of even older structures, those built commonly during the pre-Mughal Lodi period.

## *Delhi*

Delhi remained a city of major importance during Jahangir's time and architecture there tended to be innovative. Here, for example, notables such as Shaikh Farid Bukhari built their own tombs; nearby Shaikh Farid Bukhari established the town of Faridabad, providing a serai and mosque. Visits by the emperor to Delhi inevitably included hunting in the environs, attending to administrative concerns and visits to Humayun's tomb and the adjacent Chishti *dargah* of Nizam al-Din. The *dargah* was particularly revitalized through architectural patronage during the Mughal period. In it, the tomb of the fourteenth-century poet Amir Khusrau, considered by many the greatest writer of Indian Persian, had been embellished during the reigns of Babur, Humayun and Akbar. The tomb as it presently appears, however, was constructed in 1605-06 by Khwaja Tahir Muhammad Imad al-Din Hasan during Jahangir's reign. Within a Humayun-period rectangular enclosure composed of red sandstone latticed walls (Plate 13) is the Jahangir-period tomb (Plate 194). It is constructed of white marble lattice screen walls continuing a tradition established in Akbar's reign (cf. Plate 26). There screens are surmounted by a pyramidal vault. The white marble provides a subtle visual link between the poet, long revered as a saint, and Nizam al-Din himself, also enshrined in a tomb of this material.

Nizam al-Din's own tomb, reconstructed during Akbar's reign, was further embellished by Shaikh Farid Bukhari. In 1608—09, he provided a canopy for the tomb's interior. Constructed of wood exquisitely inlaid with mother-of-pearl, this canopy is a rare example of dated Mughal woodwork. Four bracketed pillars support the canopy's vaulted roof, reflecting the inscription here that

## PATRONAGE OF PRINCES AND NOBILITY

![](_page_42_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 78. Tomb of Muhammad Mumin Husaini, Nakodar

describes the sky as supported on four pillars. The inscription further states that the canopy was donated to honor the saint, but also to increase the honor of the builder. Concurrently with the provision of this canopy, Shaikh Farid Bukhari built the tomb of another Chishti saint, Wajih al-Din, in Ahmadabad, and several other religious buildings in the eastern Indian city of Bihar Sharif (Plates *y6* and 94).

While these two structures in the *dargah* date to the initial period of Jahangir's reign, the next monument, containing a grave inscribed 1623-24, belongs to his final years. This is the tomb of Mirza cAziz Koka Khan-i Ac zam, the son of Ataga Khan (Plate *79).* He built this, his own mausoleum, during his lifetime, but earlier, in Akbar's reign, he had constructed a tomb for his father in this *dargah.* Mirza cAziz Koka obviously favored beautiful buildings. For example, his house in the Agra fort was painted by the head of Akbar's painting atelier, cAbd al-Samad,30 and his tomb remains the finest Jahangir-period building in Delhi today. Constructed wholly of white marble, the tomb is known popularly as the Chausath Khamba after the sixty-four pillars that divide it internally into twenty-five bays. Each bay is surmounted by a dome; nevertheless, externally the tomb appears flat-roofed. Each facade contains five

> 30 Bhakkari, *Dhakbirat al-Khawanin,* i: 87.

![](_page_43_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 79. Mirza cAziz Koka Khan-i Ac zam's tomb, Delhi

arches supported by square pilasters. Between each pilaster is a screen recalling those at the tomb of Sarkhej in Gujarat. The links with Sarkhej are not accidental, for Mirza cAziz Koka served several times as Jahangir's governor of Gujarat. He died there and was temporarily buried at Sarkhej. With the exception of the marble screens, the tomb bears very little ornamentation; its forms instead emphasized by uncluttered lines of the white marble surface serve as the main architectural vocabulary. Thus this tomb, perhaps more than any other surviving example of late Jahangir-period architecture, serves as a transition to the style associated with Shah Jahan's period.

Yet not all work in Delhi reflects current trends. Situated roughly between the *dargah* and Humayun's tomb is the tomb of cAbd al-Rahim Khan-i Khanan, who died in 1626, a great general under both Akbar and Jahangir. Modeled on Humayun's tomb, the Khan-i Khanan's tomb is a large square domed structure that probably once stood in a four-quartered garden. This tomb was originally embellished with red sandstone and narrow strips of white marble trim as at Humayun's tomb. Most of the facing, however, was stripped in the eighteenth century and used on the tomb of Safdar Jang in south Delhi. The tomb appears remarkably conservative for a structure built at the time of the Khan-i Khanan's death. It may, in fact, be an earlier work, for, despite its half-dome and the net squinches within recessed entrance arches, one Mughal

# PATRONAGE OF PRINCES AND NOBILITY

![](_page_44_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 80. Entrance, serai, Chatta

source states that the Khan-i Khanan was buried in the tomb of his wife, who had died in 1598.31

## *The road from Delhi to Allahabad*

The road between Delhi and Agra was marked during Jahangir's reign by *kos minar,* many of them still extant. Along this road, the highest-ranking nobles built magnificent serais - at Faridabad, Hodal, Palwal, Chatta and Mathura. This construction was intended in part to protect their own investments; for example, Maryam al-Zamani, the queen mother, invested heavily in trade. It also responded to Jahangir's accession order that serais be built, earning these nobles greater favor with the king, while at the same time serving as a manifestation of their own power and wealth.

Although most of these serais have disappeared, at least the entrance gate of one, at Chatta, about 60 km north of Agra, is well preserved (Plate 80). The red sandstone gate, flanked on either side by oriel windows, is entered through a

<sup>31</sup> See Bhakkari, *Dhakhirat al-Khawanin,* 1: 60, for the burial spot and *Maasir,* i: 88, for the date of his wife's death.

Plate 81. Partial facade, Kanch Mahal, Agra

deeply recessed arch. Although the gate is uninscribed, the carved wine vessels and elaborate battlement that embellish it reflect current Mughal taste. That date is also supported by literary evidence. Finch, traveling in 1611, omits Chatta from his extensive list of serais, but Steel and Crowther, traveling in 1615, mention it, suggesting that the Chatta serai was constructed between 1611 and 1615.

Beyond Chatta lay Agra, Jahangir's paramount city, then known as Akbarabad. Contemporary texts refer to the splendid structures built by the nobility there. Few of these remain, however, except the mosque of Mu<sup>c</sup> tamad Khan and two buildings known as the Kanch Mahal and the Suraj Bhan-ka Bagh, both constructed of red sandstone that bears elaborate carved ornament.

The Kanch Mahal (Plate 81), a gateway to a tomb, is situated east of Akbar's tomb. Its proximity to this imperial tomb suggests that the structure was built by a member of the royal household; the elaborate screens in its windows, areas that otherwise are left open, indicate it was used by women. A two-storied structure, this entrance gate opens onto a rectangular courtyard containing an octagonal tomb. Several features of the Kanch Mahal confirm its Jahangirperiod date. Its interior plan with a central chamber surrounded by eight smaller ones follows that of other buildings of the time, for example, the prince Shah Jahan's Shahi Bagh in Ahmadabad (Plate 74). Its elaborately carved red

## PATRONAGE OF PRINCES AND NOBILITY

![](_page_46_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 82. Mu<sup>c</sup> tamad Khan's mosque, Agra

sandstone facade is magnificently trimmed with white marble inlay, an elaboration of the surface that evolves from such earlier buildings as Akbar's so-called Sultana's House at Fatehpur Sikri and the Jahangiri Mahal at Agra fort (Plate 21). Here, however, the surface of the Kanch Mahal is even more complex. Motifs such as the wine vessels, not seen in Akbar-period buildings, and the dominant arabesque of the spandrels recalling those on the gateway of Akbar's tomb, confirm the Kanch Mahal's Jahangir-period date.

In the heart of Agra city is a well-preserved red sandstone mosque attributed to Mu<sup>c</sup> tamad Khan (Plate 82). He was responsible for Jahangir's officers serving in the Deccan. The emperor was very fond of Mu<sup>c</sup> tamad Khan and entrusted him with writing his memoirs when he himself was no longer able to do so, stating that Mu<sup>c</sup> tamad Khan "is a servant who knows my temperament and understands my words."<sup>32</sup> Perhaps inspired by this trust, he wrote his own history of Jahangir's reign, the *Iqbal Nama.*

As at the Kanch Mahal and Suraj Bhan-ka Bagh, the red sandstone surface of this rectangular mosque is divided into square and rectangular panels carved with wine vessels and geometric patterns (Plate 83). The engaged exterior

> 32  *Tuzuk,* 11: 246.

![](_page_47_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 83. Detail of Muc tamad Khan's mosque, Agra

turrets, similar to those on Ic timad al-Daula's tomb (Plate 71), may suggest a date toward the end of Jahangir's reign. The placement of the decoration in panels that cover the surface in a grid plan is characteristic of later Jahangiri ornamentation, seen, for example, on the Serai Nur Mahal dated 1618-20 (Plate *69).* Thus, in the Agra region, close to the Fatehpur Sikri quarries, nobles favored construction in red sandstone carved with elaborate decoration.

A number of serais marked the road between Agra and Allahabad but few remain. The largest monument in Allahabad remained Akbar's fort that had been seized by Jahangir in his days as Shah Salim. But he appears to have made no subsequent additions there. Rather it was the four-part garden containing the tomb of his first wife, Shah Begum (Plate 55), that was embellished later in his reign. It became the site of two more princely tombs. In the center of this garden, aligned with the queen's tomb, is that of her daughter, Sultan Nisar Begum, while the more distant from the queen's tomb but still aligned with it is the tomb of her son, Khusrau. Behind Sultan Nisar Begum's tomb is a large *baoli,* praised by Mundy, that provided water for the four-part garden.

In 1621 Jahangir delivered his ill-fated son, Khusrau, into the hands of Prince

## PATRONAGE OF PRINCES AND NOBILITY

![](_page_48_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 84. Khusrau's tomb, Allahabad

Shah Jahan; a year later Khusrau was dead. Many believe that Shah Jahan murdered his elder brother, seeing him as a potential rival for the throne. Khusrau's body, according to the European Manrique, was taken first to Agra, but at Nur Jahan's insistence was removed from the imperial capital to Allahabad. During the journey, shrines honoring him as a saint were erected, but quickly dismantled under imperial order.

A verse inside the Chunar sandstone tomb bears the date 1622, recording the year of Khusrau's demise, not the tomb's construction. It was probably commenced by Sultan Nisar Begum, Khusrau's sister, when she constructed her own tomb. This square-plan tomb appears two-storied from the exterior, even though it consists of a single chamber (Plate 84). A single dome surmounts it, and a *chattri* is placed at each corner. Above the tomb's arched entrance is a recessed demi-dome in whose kite-shaped pedentives are painted floral patterns and an angel.

On the interior of the tomb's dome is a central medallion with radiating stellate and net patterning; it is similar to the one at I<sup>c</sup> timad al-Daula's nearcontemporary tomb. The walls are painted with cypress, floral and other motifs, but it is the Persian verses, whose message reflects the sorrow of Khusrau's own life, that dominate the interior. Next to the cenotaph, Mundy observed in 1632, was Khusrau's own copy of the Quran. Then, too, a wooden

*H7*

![](_page_49_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 85. Interior dome, Sultan Nisar Begum's tomb, Allahabad

canopy, probably similar to that in Shaikh Nizam al-Din's tomb, was over the grave. Thus despite imperial injunction, the deceased Khusrau was given saintly status.

The tomb Sultan Nisar Begum built for herself in 1624-25 but never used is the most impressive. Similar to Khusrau's tomb, this one sits on a very high plinth, dominating the garden. Its Chunar sandstone fabric is more elaborate than Khusrau's, embellished with panels of carved scalloped arches.

Within the crypt in the plinth's interior is a small chamber whose ceiling is conceived as a series of concentric stars within a net-like vault. Here the original polychrome of yellows, blues and reds is beautifully preserved. The dome of the tomb's main chamber (Plate 85) is similar in conception; its walls (Plate 86) bear paintings of wine vessels, geometric dadoes, cypresses and flowering plants of the type derived from European herbals popular in the late Jahangir period. Persian verses evoking God as the sole refuge also embellish the walls. These are the best preserved examples of painting in any Mughal tomb. The motifs, borrowed from the vocabulary of mystical poetry, are similar to those found on the interior of I<sup>c</sup> timad al-Daula's tomb. While Sultan Nisar Begum embellished this garden site ostensibly to honor her ill-fated brother, in truth, the central position and beauty of her own tomb suggest that her own glorification was also intended.

## *Eastern India*

# *unar* **Ch**

Akbar's fortress at Chunar, the gateway to eastern India, remained a Mughal garrison, though no significant buildings were added there during Jahangir's reign. Elsewhere in Chunar, however, are two fine Jahangir-period buildings constructed of stone from the Chunar quarries that had provided building materials since the third century B.C. One, Shah Qasim Sulaiman's *dargab,* not far from the fort, was admired by British travelers and artists, although it is rarely noticed today. The second, the tomb of Iftikhar Khan, is located several kilometers from the town.

Shah Qasim Sulaiman, also known as Shaikh Qasim Qadiri, had attracted a considerable following in Lahore, but supported Khusrau and as a result was imprisoned in the Chunar fort. A year after his death in 1606, his followers reputedly constructed his simple unadorned tomb. Its entrance gate (Plates 87 and 88), unusually refined and elegant, is far more impressive than the tomb itself. This is, in part, due to the emphasis on height achieved by the balance between the proportionately small entrance arch and the soaring *pishtaq.* The screened walls surmounting the roof, the projecting battlement, and the corner finials *(guldasta)* further accentuate the sense of height. The entire facade is

![](_page_51_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 87. Gate, Shah Qasim Sulaiman's *dargah,* Chunar

covered with superb carving that further enhances the structure's refinement. The jewel-like work, one of the best examples of Mughal carving in all eastern India, is reminiscent of that on Sultan Nisar Begum's tomb, although here there is considerably more detail.

Clearly a patron of considerable taste must have constructed the *dargah* gate. In fact, it may have been the emperor himself, for tradition claims that Jahangir eventually recognized the sanctity of Shah Sulaiman's *dargah* and endowed land for its support. Considering Khusrau's popularity, Jahangir's provision of funds for this gate at the shrine of the deceased prince's supporter would have been one way for the emperor to absolve his role in Khusrau's death and at the same time maintain popular support.

On the outskirts of Chunar, in a village known as Serai Sikandarpur, is the Chunar sandstone tomb of Iftikhar Khan, known locally as the Tahsildar Daftar, or the Tahsildar's Office (Plates 89 and 90). It is a striking monument, though it lacks the prolific carving of the nearby *dargah* gate that was built about the same time. In 1612 Iftikhar Khan, noted for his bravery in warfare, died in Bengal. His association with Chunar remains unclear, although he probably had a landholding there. The tomb is not dated, but an inscription of 1613-14 in a well just outside the compound's sole entrance gate records the construction of a building, almost surely the tomb, by Sikandar. Nothing is

Plate 88. Detail of gate

known about Sikandar, even though his name is memorialized by the site's current name. The well served as the water source for the garden in which the tomb is set.

Iftikhar Khan's tomb establishes a type that quickly becomes popular across eastern India. Its entrance gate, similar in form to the one at the nearby *dargah* of Shah Qasim Sulaiman, leads to the square-plan tomb situated on a high plinth in the middle of the garden. Its central chamber is surrounded by a veranda. In lieu of screened walls, as seen at the Akbar-period tombs of Muhammad Ghaus in Gwalior or Salim Chishti at Fatehpur Sikri (Plates *16* and 42), here the veranda is left open. The tomb is surmounted by a single dome that sits on a high square base; a *chattri* marks each corner of the roof. All these features are adopted for a tomb-type that becomes especially popular in eastern India.

### *Bihar: tombs at Maner and Champanagar*

The second and most magnificent tomb of this type is at Maner, in Mughal times at the confluence of the Son and Ganges rivers, about 25 km west of Patna. There an important shrine known as the Bari Dargah had developed around the grave of Yahya Manen, the father of Sharaf al-Din Manen, a fourteenth-century mystic. Pre-Mughal sultans as well as Humayun and Akbar

Plate 89. Iftikhar Khan's tomb, Chunar

had visited this shrine. Then, between 1605 and 1619, Ibrahim Khan Kakar, whose title was Dilawar Khan, methodically enhanced this shrine and built other structures in Maner, for example, an extensive *khanqah.* Tradition holds that he was the disciple of Shah Daulat, a descendent and spiritual heir of Yahya Maneri. His wealth probably came from landholdings, among them Jaunpur, which was granted as his *jagir* in 1607, two years after he had constructed a mosque in the Bari Dargah.

Ibrahim Khan Kakar's most ambitious architectural endeavor was a second shrine, the Chotti Dargah, built around the grave of his spiritual master *(pir),* Shah Daulat, and housing a large tomb that follows the type established by Iftikhar Khan's tomb at Chunar (Plate 90). The Chunar sandstone complex is the most magnificent Mughal mausoleum in eastern India. The compound's north entrance gate was built in 1613-14; three years later, in 1616-17, the main tomb was finished; and the mosque and enclosure walls (actually never completed) were constructed in 1618-19. Linking this *dargah* to the Bari Dargah is a large tank whose ghats (stepped embankments) are embellished with *chattris.*

The overall appearance of the elevated two-storied gate is fortress-like, but its individual features are finely carved. So, too, is the three-bayed single-aisled mosque, surmounted by a single truncated cloistered vault. Its east facade is

![](_page_54_Figure_0.jpeg)

## PATRONAGE OF PRINCES AND NOBILITY

Plate 90. Plan of Iftikhar Khan's tomb

highly articulated by numerous arched niches, although it is less ornate than the entrance gate at Shah Qasim Sulaiman's *dargab.*

Shah Daulat's tomb (Plates 91 and 92), the first of its type in Bihar, is a refined version of Iftikhar Khan's tomb in Chunar, built three years earlier. It is, moreover, taller and better proportioned. Like Iftikhar Khan's tomb, this one consists of a central square chamber surrounded by a continuous veranda. It is also crowned by a single central dome and flanked at each corner by a domed *chattri.* Overall, the tomb is embellished with well-executed inscriptions and exquisitely carved floral and geometric patterns as well as fine stone screens. This is the last major monument in all eastern India to be constructed

![](_page_55_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 91. Shah Daulat's tomb, also known as the Chotti Dargah, Maner

wholly in ashlar masonry; however, the tomb-type will be seen again in slightly variant forms in both Bihar and Bengal, for example, in the tomb of Bibi Maryam in Narayanganj (Dhaka District) and the tomb of Shamsher Khan in Shamshernagar (Aurangabad District) (Plate 220). This tomb-type, like the sandstone from which Shah Daulat's mausoleum was constructed, was carried eastward along the Ganges.

By contrast to the standard eastern Indian tomb-type established at Chunar and enhanced at Maner, one tomb is different in its obvious use of pre-Mughal Bengali features. This is the tomb of Makhdum Sahib at Champanagar, just outside of Bhagalpur (Plate 93). This tomb, known as the Maskan-i Barari and dated to 1622-23, wa s constructed by Khwaja Ahmad Samarqandi, a recently appointed Mughal administrator. Characteristic of its pre-Mughal Bengali style are the simple square form, the austere brick facade, and the curved cornice. While the impact of pre-Mughal Bengali architecture is seen on buildings of Bihar well into the late sixteenth century, for example the 1587 Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque at Hajipur, the lack of Mughal traits on the tomb of Makhdum Sahib is unusual considering the fact that there was a well-established Mughal tomb-type in eastern India. That it was not used here is surprising because by now the Mughals had long ruled Bihar. In fact, the very name of Prince Parviz appears on this tomb's inscription.

## *Bihar: Bihar Sharif*

Bihar Sharif, the capital of pre-Mughal Bihar, remains today a site of considerable importance, since the saint Sharaf al-Din Maneri (d. 1381) is buried here. Even though the town had diminished in administrative significance, Mughal nobles continued to build there. Among them was Shaikh Farid Bukhari, known for his patronage in Delhi, Lahore and Ahmadabad (Plate *76),* who, with his wife, provided the most notable Mughal building in Bihar Sharif. This is the Bukhari mosque (Plate 94), completed on November 20,1608. Epigraphs indicate that Shaikh Lad, otherwise unknown, was responsible for the procurement of the materials as well as for the supervision of the work. More

![](_page_57_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 93. Tomb of Makhdum Sahib, also known as the Maskan-i Baran tomb, Champanagar

important, they relate that the mosque was designed by Shaikh Farid himself, noteworthy since he was not in Bihar when it was built. However, during Akbar's reign his family must have been associated with Bihar, for his brother is buried in a grave dated 1583-84 close to Maner.

Although the mosque form derives in large part from that of the 1587 Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque in Hajipur, at that time a highly localized type, it becomes the standard for subsequent mosques across eastern India. This Bihar Sharif mosque is a large single-aisled three-bayed rectangular structure surmounted by three domes and marked at each corner by semi-engaged octagonal turrets. For more than a century it served as the standard for mosques in Bihar and Bengal, for example Mirza Ma<sup>c</sup> sum's mosque (1614—16) in Patna and the mosque of Raja Bahroz (1656-57) in Kharagpur (Plate 152).

The mosque's patron, Shaikh Farid, is noted in Mughal texts for his generous patronage of architecture throughout north India. His buildings, however, were constructed during the few years between 1606 and 1609, perhaps in thanksgiving for his newly bestowed title, Nawab Murtaza Khan, invariably mentioned in the building's inscriptions. Possibly, then, grateful for his increased prestige under Jahangir, he took seriously the emperor's accession orders to build both serais and religious structures.

Plate 94. Bukhari mosque, Bihar Sharif

## *Bihar: Khurramabad and Sasaram*

Although the role of construction by highly placed nobles such as Shaikh Farid is mentioned in Mughal histories and biographies, much of the work in the Mughal hinterlands remains unnoticed. Such is the case with an entire town named Khurramabad, in honor of the then heir apparent, Prince Khurram, the future Shah Jahan. According to an inscription on the east face of the town's Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque, cAli Akbar constructed here a bridge, mosque, serai, fort and baths between 1612-13 and 1617. The Khurramabad bridge (Plate 95), used until recently, is a smaller version of Raja Man Singh's bridge in Rajmahal and an eleven-arched bridge in Delhi dated 1612. Of Akbar cAli's other buildings only the largely ruined mosque remains. It was a single-aisled three-bayed structure whose central *pishtaq,* some 12 meters high, was flanked on either side by bays with narrow arched entrances, revealing the influence of north Indian Mughal buildings.

The date of Khurramabad's commencement, 1612, suggests that the town, near the notorious dacoit-ridden Kaimar hills on the main road from Benares to Sasaram and Rohtas, was built in response to Jahangir's accession order issued some five years earlier. Peter Mundy, traveling through eastern India in 1632, twice mentions Khurramabad as a flourishing settlement constructed as a residential headquarters for the landholder of Sasaram, situated about 20 km to the east.

![](_page_59_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate95. Bridge, Khurramabad

At Sasaram is a mansion, or Qal<sup>c</sup> a as it is known today, a rare example of Mughal residential architecture in the hinterlands. It is attributed to cAli Akbar, who according to local tradition was also known as Safdar Khan, the landholder of Sasaram in Jahangir's period. The main building is three stories high. The interior consists of a high central chamber almost certainly used as the Diwan Khana, or main reception room. Surrounding this on all the floors were ancillary chambers, many of which overlooked the central room. On the west exterior facade is a large *pishtaq,* whose recessed arch is ornamented with patterns on burnished stucco recalling Mughal decor elsewhere, for example, Narnaul's Jal Mahal. Surrounding this three-storied building are traces of a single-storied flat-roofed gallery similar to the contemporary galleries of the Chotti Dargah in Maner. This complex matches well the descriptions written by European visitors of the housing for Mughal nobility in Agra or Delhi during Shah Jahan's reign and later. It thus suggests that the housing type of the Mughal nobility was established before Shah Jahan's reign and that this particular dwelling was modeled on those constructed at the major centers.

#### *Patna*

In Patna, as in many cities that still retain their importance, very few buildings of early Mughal date remain. The continuous process of urbanization has

PATRONAGE OF PRINCES AND NOBILITY

![](_page_60_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 96. Central mihrab, Mirza Mac sum's Jamic mosque, Patna

replaced them. Only two early Mughal monuments in Patna are worthy of comment, both characteristic of styles more widely seen in Bihar. The first is Mirza Ma<sup>c</sup> sum's mosque, inscribed as a Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque and constructed between 1614-15 and 1616-17. Mirza Mac sum entered imperial service during Akbar's reign and then served in Bengal under Jahangir's governor, Islam Khan. Evidently Mirza Mac sum left Bengal after Islam Khan's death in 1613 and retired to Patna, where he constructed a mosque and also a market.

Mirza Ma<sup>c</sup> sum's mosque is a less refined version of Shaikh Farid Bukhari's mosque built in Bihar Sharif in 1608 (Plate 94). The engaged columns flanking the central bay rise above the central *pishtaq,* a feature characteristic of many mosques in Patna and elsewhere in eastern India. Net patterns rendered in stucco appear in the central mihrab's soffit (Plate *96)* and again in the vaulting. This is the earliest known use of net patterning in stucco on an eastern Indian mosque, although the technique is seen earlier in parts of the Rohtas palace.

The second surviving Mughal monument in Patna is the Patthar-ki Masjid, built by Nazar Khwishgi in 1626-27. Nazar Khwishgi is best known for his stellar career under Shah Jahan, but during Jahangir's reign he was a close attendant of Prince Parviz, one of Jahangir's sons. Parviz was governor of

Bihar, but never actually went there; probably Nazar Khwishgi served as his deputy.<sup>33</sup>

The mosque's east facade is stucco faced and adheres to the formula already seen in all Mughal mosques in Bihar. The other three sides, however, are stonefaced, nearly the last use of stone for a building's facade in either Bengal or Bihar. The stone is carved with small floral medallions and slender-necked wine flasks, a motif seen on contemporary monuments at the center (Plates 72 and 83), but rarely in eastern India.

## *Bengal*

Islam Khan, Jahangir's governor of Bengal from 1609 to 1613, finally terminated rebel activities that had plagued the Mughals in Bengal since Akbar's time. He moved the capital from Akbarnagar (Rajmahal) to Dhaka, then named Jahangirnagar. Little remains of early seventeenth-century Dhaka except some small river forts used against pirates, a constant threat to Mughal authority.

Outside of Dhaka, the Jamic mosque at Atiya (Plate 97) in Tangail District, Bangladesh, constructed in 1609, is the sole dated monument of Jahangir's era in all Bengal. This is the latest mosque here built in a pre-Mughal regional idiom. It consists of a single-domed square prayer chamber with a tripledomed veranda projecting on the east, suggesting that in areas away from Mughal administrative centers there was little influence from the mainstream Mughal architectural tradition.

The rebel prince Shah Jahan, in his quest for the Mughal throne, was well aware of the continued weakness of imperial authority in Bengal. He marched to Bengal in 1624, defeated Jahangir's governor, and gained control of Akbarnagar, long the key to Bengal. From this strategic vantage, the rebel prince easily gained all Bengal and Bihar. While credit for re-establishing Akbarnagar's pre-eminence generally is given to Shah Shujac , his father Shah Jahan was initially responsible.

The memoirs of Mirza Nathan, a noble posted in Bengal since the early seventeenth century and serving in the rebel prince Shah Jahan's army, give insight into several architectural projects of the time. Among these are a palace at Akbarnagar and a new fort at Garhi. Today known as Teliagarhi, Garhi is just 30 km northeast of Akbarnagar. The fort, situated at the traditional approach to Bengal, was secured with stone walls. Mirza Nathan, charged with erecting this fort, notes that a different officer was responsible for every 20 meters of the fortification walls, thus assuring their speedy completion. In spite of this, the walls, constructed of alternating layers of local brown and black stones, appear uniform. No royal palace, however, was built inside, since

Plate 97. Jamic mosque, Atiya

the hasty construction of such an edifice, a contemporary stated, would alarm the local population. In any event, all the available workers were already engaged on the walls. John Marshall, an early agent with the East India Company who visited the fort in 1761, reports that it was remarkably strong, adequate for about eighty cannon and twice as many small guns and muskets. Partially still standing, the fortifications remain as testimony to solid workmanship in spite of speedy construction.

While Garhi was being built, the rebel prince Shah Jahan ordered Muhammad Salih to construct a palace at Akbarnagar. Mirza Nathan describes the palace, which no longer survives, as consisting of the following buildings: a Private Audience Hall *{Ghusl Khana),* a Throne Room *(Takht-i Daulat),* quarters for the harem, a Public Audience Hall and a bath. They probably were tent-constructed, not built of more durable materials, since he describes them as easily rearranged.

#### CONSTRUCTION BY THE HINDU NOBILITY

Although Akbar's reign is generally considered the period most tolerant of the Hindu nobility, under Jahangir they also fared well. Hindu nobles built

![](_page_63_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 98. Jahangiri Mandir, Orchha

mansions, palaces and temples. And just as the houses and gardens built by the Muslim nobility were considered state, not private, property, the same held true for the Hindu amirs. For example, the Matiyaburi palace of Ram Das Kachhwaha, a Hindu, was confiscated in 1612 when Jahangir became displeased with his performance in battle, indicating that the dwelling was regarded as state property, not a personal investment to which the patron had absolute right.34

Construction on a *watan jagir*, an ancestral landholding of a vassal prince, seems to have been more secure. That land was generally left in the hands of successive rulers, although the Mughal monarch occasionally ignored primogeniture and awarded the title raja if he believed another candidate was more suitable. During Jahangir's reign there is no better example of patronage in a watan jagir than that of Raja Bir Singh Deo in his territory of Orchha in Bundelkhand. Bir Singh's rise commenced in 1602, when at the future Jahangir's request the raja killed Abu al-Fazl. In 1623, after steady advancement, Jahangir awarded him the title maharaja (great prince), the first time this was bestowed as an official Mughal title.<sup>35</sup> The raja died in 1627, the same year as his patron, Jahangir.

Plate 99. Bir Singh's palace, Datia

Although Jahangir makes no reference to Bir Singh's building activities, chronicles of Shah Jahan's time praise the works he constructed. Among these, the most notable are his palace at Datia and an addition known as the Jahangiri Mandir to the earlier sixteenth-century palaces at Orchha. The Jahangiri Mandir (Plate 98) is a square-plan structure measuring *6j* meters per side. Impressively high, it is surmounted by *chattris.* The interior consists of three stories arranged around a large open courtyard, similar to the zenana at the palace Raja Man Singh built at Rohtas. Many of the interior walls are magnificently painted with scenes from Hindu lore as well as courtly figures based in large measure on Mughal types.

The palace Raja Bir Singh constructed at Datia, about 30 km northeast of Orchha, was built about 1620. This square-plan building, situated on a rocky outcrop, dominates the terrain (Plate 99). The five-storied palace, rising to a height of 40 meters, has a layout similar to that of contemporary Rajput royal dwellings, but many of the motifs that adorn it belong to a characteristic Mughal vocabulary. Its multi-storied chambers are arranged around a central courtyard, a plan like that at the Orchha Jahangiri Mandir. Here, however, a pavilion at the courtyard's center is linked to each wing by double-storied corridors, thus dividing the palace's courtyard into four units, recalling the

arrangement of a *char bagh.* Most of the palace's chambers are trabeated, although some of the ceilings are vaulted and bear traces in stucco of net patterning typical in Jahangir-period architecture (Plates 60, *61* and 85).

Also revealing the influence of imperial Jahangir architecture are the motifs painted on the stucco. These are rendered in a Persianized manner similar to motifs on the walls of Sultan Nisar Begum's tomb dated 1624-2 5 (Plate 85). On the spandrels and sides of a high arched niche that towers over the main entrance are fine paintings (Plate 100). There, in addition to the centrally placed figure of the elephant-headed god Ganesh, found at the entrance to many Hindu dwellings, are subjects more characteristic of Mughal painting: geometric patterns, horses and riders, wine vessels and nobles.

At Orchha Bir Singh constructed an enormous temple, today known as the Chaturbhuj. Although it was partially demolished under Shah Jahan in response to considerable political difficulties the Mughals were having there, it remains well preserved. The temple's interior is domed and arcuated, possibly inspired by Raja Man Singh's Govind Deva temple of 1590 at Brindavan. Close to Brindavan, at Mathura, Bir Singh built another temple, known as the Keshava Deva temple, dismantled at the beginning of Aurangzeb's reign. It was constructed of red Sikri stone at a cost of 33 million rupees, an enormous sum. The Frenchman Tavernier relates that the temple was very large and sumptuous, visible from a distance of 16 km. The sanctum of this temple, too, was probably influenced by Raja Man Singh's Govind Deva temple at Brindavan. On the temple's walls was a profusion of carved images, a feature lacking at the earlier Govind Deva temple.

Under Jahangir, just as under his father, rank and favor appear to have played a much larger role than sectarian affiliation in determining who built major structures. Moreover, building temples in the Mathura-Brindavan region, an area not far from the imperial seat at Agra, appears to have been one way that Hindus who were part of the Mughal administrative system could display their status and •wealth. This did not go unnoticed, for Jahangir comments on the beauty of Brindavan's temples. Moreover, a considerable number of those in Brindavan were the beneficiary of imperial grants.<sup>36</sup> Among those the emperor probably admired were the temple complex of Madan Mohan and the Jugal Kishore temple (Plate 101). Each is constructed of Sikn sandstone and with features adhering to a Mughal idiom.

Unlike north Indian temples reflecting current Mughal taste, temples constructed in Bengal assumed an increasingly regional character. Among these is

a type known as *bangala,* probably modeled on the curved roofs of Bengali huts, which is pertinent to the subsequent development of Mughal architecture (Plates 113,119 and 175). Although this building type only survives in Bengal's temples, it was probably used in domestic settings as well. These temples are rectangular in plan and surmounted by curved roofs described as *bangala,* for example the Gopinath temple in Pabna, dated 1607. Such temples were not limited to Bengal, but are found also in the eastern portions of Bihar, adjacent to Bengal, for example, the Raja Rani temple (Plate 102) in Kharagpur (Munger District). Built by the Kharagpur rajas before their conversion to Islam in Jahangir's reign,37 temples of this sort would have been known to the rebel prince Shah Jahan from the period that he spent in nearby Rajmahal. Later in Shah Jahan's period, as we shall see, rectangular-plan structures with *bangala* roofs are adopted in imperial palace structures, especially those associated with public viewing chambers.

## CONCLUSION

Jahangir had considerably more interest in architecture than is commonly believed. He constructed extensively - palaces, hunting lodges and tombs although hardly any religious buildings, despite his devotion to Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din. Under Jahangir, Mughal architecture shows considerable continuity as the concepts mature. Thus, for example, paradisical imagery associated with funereal settings, first seen in Akbar's architecture, is developed in the tomb Jahangir constructed for his father. Also, like Akbar, Jahangir used architecture to imply the ruler's semi-divine status, foreshadowing developments under his son and successor, Shah Jahan. This we see both in tile and painted ornament on surviving buildings, for example, the Kala Burj in the Lahore fort, as well as in paintings illustrating the emperor enthroned. In addition, Jahangir, like his grandfather, Babur, was concerned not only with the building itself but also with its setting. Buildings such as his Chesma-i Nur are architecturally uninspiring but spectacularly situated.

## CONCLUSION

![](_page_68_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 102. Raja Rani temple, Kharagpur

Many aspects of Jahangir's architectural style have strong roots in the buildings of Akbar. They are not, however, always the roots one might expect. Tombs, for example those Jahangir built for Akbar and Shah Begum, are not based on older Timurid-inspired tomb-types but rather on Akbar's multistoried palace pavilions. The few surviving palaces Jahangir constructed, on the other hand, are modeled on older palace types, such as Akbar's trabeated pavilions at Fatehpur Sikri, even continuing the dominant use of red sandstone. Now though, surfaces are at times more highly articulated, and white marble, previously used only for tombs at the shrines of saints, was introduced for palace architecture. This sets the stage for the substantially more extensive use of white marble under Shah Jahan.

Despite the fact that most of Jahangir's residential architecture - his forts, palaces and hunting pavilions — is trabeated, Timurid building techniques were not altogether rejected during his reign. The Kala Burj, for example, reveals an elaborately vaulted interior as does the tomb Sultan Nisar Begum built for herself in Allahabad near the end of Jahangir's reign. Buildings such as those constructed in Jahangir's reign explain the persistence of Timurid forms into the reign of Shah Jahan, where they surface most clearly and magnificently in the world-famous Taj Mahal.

The emperor was not the only trend setter, for his favorite wife, Nur Jahan, was a leading arbitrator of taste. She built elegant serais, gardens and an

exquisite white marble tomb whose inlay and motifs foreshadow developments in Shah Jahan's reign. Her dynamic interest in construction stimulated a similar interest by court women in subsequent reigns.

Jahangir not only encouraged the nobility to build, especially in the hinterlands, but also often rewarded them by advancement in rank. If in Akbar's period architecture at the frontier was often a symbol of Mughal power, in Jahangir's reign it was an indication of genuine presence, serving permanent populations as well as encouraging trade across the empire. Hindu rajas, also members of the Mughal nobility, built palaces on their ancestral lands that incorporated trends at the Mughal court. The styles of all these structures, as in Akbar's time, introduced new aesthetics to the provinces, ones that usually echoed contemporary tastes in the major cities of Agra and Lahore.
