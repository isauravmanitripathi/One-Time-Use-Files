# CHAPTER 6

# AURANGZEB AND THE ISLAMIZATION OF THE MUGHAL STYLE

Shah Iahan's third surviving son and successor, Aurangzeb, is generally considered the last effective Mughal ruler. Under his successors the Mughal domain diminished. Even in Aurangzeb's reign, persistent warfare in the Deccan and increased factionalism among the nobility had an impact on the empire's stability. Most believe that a lack of vitality in artistic production paralleled this military and political instability. As a result, the architecture of Aurangzeb and the later Mughals has largely been ignored. It should not be.

All the same, under Aurangzeb and his successors the framework of earlier architectural patronage was changed. That is, under the earlier Mughals the emperor was the model patron. The nobility generally regarded the type of structures he built and the styles he favored as the ideal to emulate. Under Aurangzeb, and especially under his successors, that changed. There was no dynamic imperial patron, so the nobility and other classes built independently of strong central direction, often employing styles and motifs that still echoed those established in Shah Jahan's reign.

# HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS DURING AURANGZEB'S REIGN

When Shah Jahan became ill in 1657, most believed that he would not survive. This sparked a war of succession among the imperial princes with Aurangzeb emerging as victor. He first celebrated his coronation in Delhi's Shalimar garden in 1658 and again the same year in the palace of Shahjahanabad, then adding to his name the title 'Alamgir (World Seizer). Although Shah Jahan recovered and lived until 1666, he remained a prisoner in the Agra fort for the rest of his life. Aurangzeb's brothers, including the former heir apparent Dara Shukoh, were executed, murdered or, in the case of Shah Shuja<sup>c</sup>, pursued until death.

Until 1681, Aurangzeb maintained his residence in Delhi. Among his most pressing problems were on-going troubles with the rebel Maratha Shivaji which finally ended in victory for the Maratha. Shivaji's death in 1680 did not terminate the Maratha threat to Mughal authority, for his son Shambuji was no less a warrior than his father. It was in pursuit of him that Aurangzeb permanently left Delhi for the Deccan. The second half of Aurangzeb's reign was spent in the Deccan where Shambuji and his Maratha successors continued to plague Mughal forces until Aurangzeb's death in 1707. As a result north India

received less imperial attention than previously, changing the nature of architectural patronage there.

By the end of Aurangzeb's fifty-year reign, the Mughal empire covered nearly the entire subcontinent. The only area not under Mughal control was the southernmost tip of India and a small area controlled by Afghans in the northwest. This is comparable to the situation at the end of Akbar's almost equally long reign, when the Mughal empire stretched into the Deccan. However, despite these seeming similarities, the differences were much deeper. Akbar bequeathed to his successors the foundations of a stable empire, unshakable until the early eighteenth century. By the time of Aurangzeb's death, the fabric of the empire had been weakened considerably by continuous warfare in the Deccan, by Sikh uprisings as well as by rebellion of the various houses of Rajasthan. Financially the empire was in dire straits. Aurangzeb also failed to maintain balance in the Mughal administrative system, most notably in the matters of rank *(mansabdari)* and landholdings. Factionalism among the nobility thus increased. Moreover, Aurangzeb's progressive inability to assimilate local elite chieftains (zamindars) into the Mughal government estranged yet another influential group. The alienation of these groups undermined a critical feature of the Mughal state. That is, Aurangzeb's predecessors had viewed themselves as fathers to their people and made their presence felt through close contact with the highest-ranking nobility, who, in turn, maintained close contact with lesser nobles, petty princes and local landholders. Aurangzeb failed to maintain this system effectively, thus essentially promoting factionalism and, by extension, rival patronage systems.

#### AURANGZEB' S PATRONAG E

#### *Attitude toward Hindu construction*

Condemned by some as a religious zealot and praised by others as an upholder of Islam, Aurangzeb and his religious policies are among the most misunderstood of all Mughal history. There is no doubt that Aurangzeb was a devout Sunni Muslim. Highly educated, he spent his leisure reading the Quran and in prayer. Aurangzeb's court also assumed an increasingly orthodox atmosphere. For example, the practice of *jharoka,* the daily presentation of the emperor to his subjects, was abandoned since it was derived from the Hindu notion of *darshan.* Court dancing girls and musicians were released, but only ostensibly for religious reasons. Aurangzeb did not have the resources to maintain them.

More controversial than the increasing austerity of the court and its ritual is Aurangzeb's attitude toward Hindu construction, especially temples. Common belief holds that he destroyed massive numbers of Hindu temples and banned the construction of new ones. True, he did not encourage the

construction of new temples, continuing a policy already in practice under his father, Shah Jahan. But when Aurangzeb did destroy temples, he did so not out of bigotry but as a political response when his authority was challenged. For example, the Keshava Deva temple in Mathura, built by the Mughal amir Raja Bir Singh and supported by imperial grants, was destroyed to retaliate for seriously disruptive Jat uprisings in the Mathura area in 1669-70.1 Mughal losses were heavy. Abd al-Nabi Khan, the commandant of Mathura (faujdar) and the patron of that city's Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque (Plate 177), was among the Mughals killed.<sup>2</sup> Temples in Cooch Behar were destroyed in 1661 after the local rajas there had defied Mughal authority.<sup>3</sup> Those Hindus who remained loyal were rewarded, indicating that temple destruction in Cooch Behar was politically motivated, not simply an aggressive act against Hindus. The demolition of temples as Udaipur, Jodhpur and other places in Rajasthan in 1679 and 1680, too, was a response to long-term recalcitrance on the part of the ranas there.<sup>4</sup> Similarly the destruction of Raja Man Singh's famous Vishvanath temple in Benares was largely to punish Hindus, especially those related to the temple's patron, who were suspected of supporting the Maratha Shivaji.<sup>5</sup> Many of these temples desecrated by Aurangzeb, including the largest and most notable among them, had been built by Mughal amirs. In each case, Aurangzeb reacted to the violation of a long-established allegiance system binding emperor and nobility by destroying property maintained previously with Mughal support. Thus in a sense Aurangzeb destroyed state-endowed property, not private works.

Some of Aurangzeb's alleged destruction is more legendary than real. He is commonly accused of destroying the caves at Ellora and other sites in modern Maharashtra, but these assertions are made in considerably later sources.<sup>6</sup> They are not mentioned in any contemporary Persian chronicle, where such destruction is generally reported in terms of glorious holy war (jihad). Rather, Aurangzeb's own writings praise the beauty of Ellora. Aurangzeb himself says the caves must be the work of Almighty God,7 indicating that he had an aesthetic sensitivity that many assume he lacked, in fact, a sensitivity not

limited to Islamic patronized structures. Moreover, decrees (farman) testify that imperial support was provided for temples throughout Aurangzeb's reign.<sup>8</sup> These orders were issued either to protect the rights of Hindu subjects or to reward service rendered by Hindus.

# Imperial mosques

Contemporary histories relate that Aurangzeb repaired numerous older mosques.<sup>9</sup> The frequent mention of his repair and construction of mosques suggests that this was the architectural enterprise he most highly valued. He reputedly repaired more mosques than any of his predecessors, not just Mughal mosques but also those built under the Tughluq, Lodi and Deccani sultans as well.<sup>10</sup> In other cases Aurangzeb was attentive to the maintenance of mosques.<sup>11</sup> Once he ordered a lamp for a mosque in an old outpost, and on another occasion he wrote to his prime minister (*wazir*) to express dismay that the carpets and other furnishings of the palace were in better condition than those of the palace's mosque.

After capturing Maratha forts, Aurangzeb often ordered the construction of a mosque. In part they were erected from religious fervor and in part they served as a symbol of Mughal conquest. These mosques were probably constructed quickly of locally available materials. Other mosques he built filled a genuine need. For example, in Bijapur city he built an 'Idgah since there was no suitable one there.<sup>12</sup> In the Bijapur palace he added a mosque for his personal use. To gain special merit, the emperor even laid some of the stones himself.<sup>13</sup> Concerned that all remaining materials should not be used for impious purposes. Aurangzeb ordered them buried.<sup>14</sup>

Shortly after his accession, Aurangzeb ordered a small marble chapel, known today as the Moti or Pearl mosque, to be constructed inside the Shahjahanabad fort (Plate 160). Shah Jahan had built no mosque inside this fort, using instead the large Jamic mosque for congregational prayers. Aurangzeb, however, wanted a mosque close to his private quarters. Five years under construction, his exquisite mosque was completed in 1662-63 at considerable personal expense. It is enclosed by red sandstone walls that vary in thickness to compensate for the mosque's angle, necessary to orient the building toward Mecca, and at the same time to align it with the other palace buildings.

east, the compound consists of a courtyard with a recessed pool and the mosque building.

Although the mosque and its courtyard are small, about 9 by 15 meters internally, the high walls, over which nothing can be seen, emphasize the sense of compact verticality creating a sense of spatial tension, a characteristic of Aurangzeb's architecture. This is further underscored by the three bulbous domes on constricted necks, the central one rising above the others. These domes were originally gilt-covered copper that resembled gold, drawing attention to the height. They later were replaced with white marble domes, still in place.

Closely modeled on the Nagina mosque (Plate 114), the prayer chamber, entered through three cusped arches, is divided into two aisles of three bays each with an ancillary corridor on the north for use by the court ladies. The marble surfaces here and on the courtyard walls (Plate 161) are more ornately rendered than those on Shah Jahan's mosques (Plates 105, 114, 115 and 124). Here arabesque foliate forms - unique during this period to imperial palace mosques - cusped arches, and even architectural members are elegantly carved. They serve as a contrast to the much more sedate ornamentation of Shah Jahan's religious edifices. The immediate source of this ornate decor is surely

# AURANGZEB S PATRONAGE

![](_page_5_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 161. Courtyard walls, Moti mosque, Shahjahanabad, Delhi

the organic carving on Shah Jahan's later palace architecture, for example, the nearby throne of Shah Jahan's Public Audience Hall (Plate 119).

Aurangzeb's Badshahi mosque (Plate 162) also reveals an ornateness and emphasis on spatial tension seen in the Moti mosque, but on a much larger scale. Adjoining the Lahore fort, the Badshahi mosque remains the largest mosque in the subcontinent. An inscription over the east entrance gate indicates that it was built in 1673-74 by Aurangzeb under the supervision of Fidai Khan Koka, the emperor's foster brother. Prior to this time Lahore had no monumental mosque capable of serving the population. Aurangzeb's construction of this mosque follows Shah Jahan's provision of large mosques close to the Agra and Delhi forts.

Situated on a raised platform, the mosque is approached by high steps. The east entrance is a large vaulted gatehouse made of red Sikri sandstone. It opens to an enormous courtyard. Built to hold 60,000 persons, the mosque served an unusual dual function of cIdgah and Jamic mosque. The prayer chamber adheres generally to the plan of Shah Jahan's Delhi mosque (Plate 124) constructed about two decades earlier, although it is considerably larger.

While closely modeled on Shah Jahan-period congregational mosques, the Badshahi mosque reveals a greater sense of spatial tension in keeping with the new aesthetic established early in Aurangzeb's reign. This is achieved, in part, by the sheer scale of the complex and by the facade's arched openings that are

![](_page_6_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 162. Badshahi mosque, Lahore

small in comparison to the building's overall massive size. Further underscoring this spatial tension are the bulbous domes and the minarets at the compound corners that emphasize the sense of verticality.

The ornamentation, like that on Aurangzeb's Moti mosque, is less chaste than on Shah Jahan's religious buildings. Here floral designs, cusped arches and cartouche motifs are outlined with white marble inlaid into the red surface. In lieu of the smooth flowing lines that characterized ornament on Shah Jahan's mosques, a series of short curved lines form the designs, thus creating a sense of ornateness that becomes characteristic of later Mughal design. The mosque's stucco interior relief, including baluster columns (Plate 163), is polychromed to achieve the effect of inlaid stone seen earlier in Shah Jahan's architecture.

Aurangzeb's mosques built in close association with palaces - primarily those dating to the time of his father, Shah Jahan - are considerably more ornate than the mosques of Shah Jahan's reign. Their decor, however, is inspired by Shah Jahan's palace architecture. Ornateness formerly reserved for palaces is now found in mosques which to Aurangzeb were the most significant architectural type. As palaces were less important to him, he curtailed some of the earlier court ritual; for example, in his eleventh regnal year he abolished the practice *oijharoka.* Significantly after this time, his most elaborate mosque, the Badshahi mosque, was built. For Aurangzeb, personal devotion and the ritual

#### AURANGZEB'S PATRONAGE

![](_page_7_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 163. Detail of interior stucco, Badshahi mosque

of prayer were more meaningful than courtly ritual such as the viewing of the emperor at the *jharoka* that had developed to bolster the semi-divine character of earlier Mughal rulers. Thus, by extension, features formerly associated with royalty were now associated with piety and Islam. Most telling is the use of the baluster column and fulsome floral forms found earlier on the marble throne in the Shahjahanabad palace's Public Audience Hall, but now found in what Aurangzeb must have considered a strictly religious realm.

By contrast to the ornateness of Aurangzeb's palace mosques is the impressive red sandstone cIdgah at Mathura (Plate 164), also certainly sponsored by Aurangzeb. This cIdgah, a mosque for the annual cId celebration, replaced the temple of Keshava Deva, destroyed in 1669-70 by Aurangzeb's command to avenge on-going insubordination by Jats. One chronicler notes that after the temple's destruction a large sum was spent on the construction of a mosque. The patron's name is not mentioned by the Mughal chronicler, but a European visiting Mathura within the decade states that it was built by Aurangzeb himself. The structure's size, 52 by 20 meters, as well as its appearance suggest imperial patronage. Situated high on a hill, the cIdgah is built on

the foundations of the destroyed temple. The facade is similar to that of the contemporary Badshahi mosque. For example, all the entrances are cusped, but they have no inlaid marble work. The mosque's double-aisled multi-bayed interior also bears little ornamentation; a large recessed tri-partite central mihrab is its most striking feature.

This mosque bears considerably less ornamentation than do the other two built by Aurangzeb, but they were associated with imperial palaces. The Mathura cIdgah, however, was situated nowhere near a palace. Rather, it was built at Mathura, a city then of secondary importance, on top of a demolished temple, to remind rebel forces that non-Muslims would be tolerated only so long as Mughal authority was obeyed.

### Tombs

Like his predecessors, Aurangzeb visited the *dargahs* of esteemed saints and contributed sizable sums for their maintenance, especially those of Gesu Daraz in Gulbarga, Mu<sup>c</sup>in al-Din in Ajmer and Khwaja Qutb Sahib Bakhtiyar Kaki in Delhi. But unlike the earlier Mughal rulers, his attitude toward building at these shrines is ambiguous. At one point he comments that the erection of mausolea over graves is not in accordance with orthodox Islamic practice.<sup>15</sup> In fact, he provided no buildings at the Ajmer or Gulbarga shrines. Yet he did order renovation of Bakhtiyar Kaki's tomb in Delhi and had a drawing made of the shrine's layout. Although the *dargah* dates to the thirteenth century, active Mughal patronage of it commenced under Aurangzeb, when several princes were buried there.<sup>16</sup> The colored tiles with floral sprays inlaid into the west wall of the saint's tomb are probably Aurangzeb's contribution.

Toward the end of his life, Aurangzeb noted that visiting graves was not acceptable in orthodox Islam. Nevertheless, the location of his own tomb indicates that he personally never lost esteem for saints. For just before he died, Aurangzeb ordered the construction of his tomb at the *dargah* of Shaikh Burhan al-Din in Khuldabad, meaning the Abode of Eternity, not far from Aurangabad and the Ellora caves. This area long had been the burial site of esteemed saints as well as some Deccani and Mughal princes. The emperor's open-air grave, in accordance with his final wishes, was marked by a simple stone cenotaph, although in the early twentieth century it was faced with white marble. The top was filled with earth so plants might grow. Its original simplicity followed a form used earlier at Jahan Ara's tomb (Plate 167), one that in the eighteenth century became common.

## AURANGZEB'S PATRONAGE

Plate 164. cIdgah, Mathura

Throughout his life Aurangzeb was concerned about the maintenance of royal tombs, foreshadowing the interest in his own. He protested bitterly when land containing the grave of one of his deceased daughters was purchased.<sup>17</sup> When a prince, Aurangzeb had written Shah Jahan regarding repairs that he felt were mandatory for the preservation of his mother's tomb, the Taj Mahal (Plate 131). After Shah Jahan's death, Aurangzeb ordered the governor of every province to send 2,000 rupees for the maintenance of this tomb.<sup>18</sup>

#### *Fortification, palace and garden architecture*

Despite his primary concern with religious building, Aurangzeb maintained a lifelong interest in secular structures. For example, he built and repaired serais, wells and bridges - structures all necessary for the welfare of the state. In addition, the construction of fortifications was well in keeping with this emperor's interests in territorial expansion. During the first few years of his reign, Aurangzeb constructed outer defensive gates before Shah Jahan's Lahore and Delhi gates of the Shahjahanabad palace. Reputedly the imprisoned Shah Jahan, upon hearing of this, wrote, "You have made the fort a bride and set a

> 17 Kashmiri, *Kalimat-i Taiyibat,* p. 43. 18 Saqi Must'ad Khan, p. 203.

veil before her face."<sup>19</sup> These monumental gates, composed of red sandstone. obscured Shah Jahan's ceremonial entrances into the fort and their original direct alignment with the city's main bazaar, its canal and Jahan Ara's gardens. They did, however, lend military strength to the fort. Aurangzeb also ordered an outer defensive wall (sher hajji) erected around the Agra fort. It was built in three years under the supervision of I<sup>c</sup>tibar Khan. Later in his reign, Aurangzeb ordered forts constructed during the campaign against the Afghans, and in 1705 another was built in conjunction with the campaign against the Marathas. In various Deccani cities additional fortification was provided. In 1683 Ihtamam Khan was charged with building walls around the city of Aurangabad. These masonry walls today have virtually disappeared, but several of the original thirteen gates still exist. The Delhi gate (Plate 165), marked by a wide entrance arch and engaged polygonal turrets surmounted by a domed *chattri* on each side, follows an older regional form, not one characteristic of contemporary Mughal structures elsewhere in India.

Aurangzeb's concerns extended beyond the military security of a locale. In Delhi he banned any construction that did not have his prior approval and went so far as to dismantle a structure erected by a lady of the court without his permission.<sup>20</sup> Even after his permanent departure from Shahjahanabad, Aurangzeb ordered Aqil Khan, governor (subadar) of Delhi, to maintain its gardens, palaces and serais. The emperor ordered reports on their condition and had drawings of them prepared.<sup>21</sup> The rooms of the palace were cleaned, locked and the carpets stored to prevent damage.<sup>22</sup>

Once Aurangzeb had moved permanently to the Deccan he did not reside in older palaces of the Deccani sultans. He had new ones built, including the palace at Aurangabad. In addition, Aurangzeb repaired the residences of others. For example, in 1685 he ordered renovations to an earlier palace near Ahmadnagar. Aurangzeb, like his predecessors, clearly felt that palatial residences were a necessity for a king. He objected, however, to the misuse of palatial settings, stating that dissipated rulers spent inordinate time in the pleasures of a palace.<sup>23</sup>

Like his predecessors, Aurangzeb loved garden settings and rewarded gardeners for good work.<sup>24</sup> He built only a few, mostly when still a prince, including a garden and tank in the vicinity of Bijapur as well as one in Ujjain.<sup>25</sup> Aurangzeb, again like his predecessors, was taken by the beauty of Kashmir

and its gardens, although he decreed in the sixth year of his reign that no king should visit there unless on military or administrative business; the pursuit of pleasure, he believed, was inadequate reason for going to Kashmir.<sup>26</sup>

#### PRINCELY PATRONAGE

During Aurangzeb's reign, most members of the imperial family were more devoted to the patronage of literature and religion than to the construction of grand edifices and gardens. However, several notable tombs and mosques were constructed by the royal family, including the Bibi-ka Maqbara, or Tomb of the Queen, built in Aurangabad (Plate 166). This monumental white tomb, completed in 1660-61, was built for Rabic a Daurani, Aurangzeb's wife, also known as Dilrus Banu, who died in 1657. At Aurangzeb's command, their eldest son, Prince A<sup>c</sup> zam Shah, built this tomb closely modeled on the Taj Mahal (Plate 131).

Persian inscriptions on the tomb's south entrance gate give the names of the architect, cAta Allah, the supervisor, Aqa Abu al-Qasim Beg, and the engineer, Haspat Rai. Other contemporary documents indicate that the supervisor and others in responsible positions were at the site continuously during this time,

![](_page_12_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 166. Tomb of Rabic a Daurani, also known as the Bibi-ka Maqbara, Aurangabad

thus resulting in the tomb's completion within four years of the queen's death. The architect, cAta Allah, was the son of Ustad Ahmad, architect of the Taj Mahal and Shahjahanabad fort. This does much to explain the tomb's close resemblance to the Taj.

Rabic a Daurani's tomb is situated in the middle of a *char bagb,* typical of most imperial Mughal tombs (Plate 19). Approximately half the size of the Taj Mahal, this tomb is different in notable ways. At Rabic a Daurani's tomb there is an emphasis on the building's verticality, not the harmonious balance of proportions as at the Taj. This rapid shift in spatial arrangement occurring shortly after Aurangzeb's accession triggers innovative directions for eighteenth- and nineteenth-century architecture.

While marble is the predominant building material for the Taj, burnished stucco covers the Bibi-ka Maqbara and its adjacent mosques. Only on the tomb's interior is marble used. Unlike the Taj, Rabic a Daurani's tomb has no inlaid work. Instead, the tomb's ornate surfaces are carved with panels of intricate floral sprays. Although the mausoleum itself is not painted, rich polychrome decorates the elaborate net vaulting of the entrance gates.

The carving, polychrome and the emphasis on the tomb's verticality are characteristic of late seventeenth- and eighteenth-century tombs and elaborate dwellings. By contrast the two mosques inside the tomb's compound bear

# PRINCELY PATRONAGE

![](_page_13_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 167. Tomb of Jahan Ara, Shahjahanabad, Delhi

little elaborate ornament, recalling more the private mosques of Shah Jahan (Plates 105, 106, 114 and 115) than Aurangzeb's contemporary Moti mosque in the Shahjahanabad fort (Plates 160 and 161).

Rabic a Daurani's tomb is the last imperial Mughal tomb built in the tradition of monumental covered mausolea set in a *char bagh.* Raushan Ara's structural tomb had been built in Shah Jahan's time with an opening in the roof exposing the cenotaph to the elements. The taste for simple graves uncovered by any superstructure, hence in accordance with orthodox practice, increases throughout the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Aurangzeb's own grave was of this type. So was the one built by Shah Jahan's devoted daughter, Jahan Ara, for many years the most powerful woman in the empire. She is buried in Delhi at Nizam al-Din's *dargab,* not far from the tomb of the esteemed saint. Enclosed by beautifully carved marble screens, her white marble cenotaph serves as a planter (Plate 167). It is marked by a marble slab carved with a verse demonstrating her humble piety and devotion to the Chishti saints.<sup>27</sup> Forgiven

Plate 168. Mosque of Zinat al-Nisa, Delhi

by Aurangzeb after Shah Jahan's death, Jahan Ara regained her position as a significant cultural force. She lived the rest of her life in Delhi writing a biography of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din Chishti and died in 1681.

Simple graves and cenotaphs now mark the burial sites of imperial princesses. Among them was Zeb al-Nisa, who died in 1702, the oldest of Aurangzeb's children and a beneficent patron of poetry and literature, and Zinat al-Nisa, Aurangzeb's second daughter, who was noted for her piety and charity. Each was buried in separate grave sites near or in Shahjahanabad. Their tombs, each destroyed, had simple graves marked by a cenotaph and headstone carved with Quranic verses similar to those at Jahan Ara's grave.

In conjunction with her simple tomb, dated 1711-12, Zinat al-Nisa constructed a large mosque in Shahjahanabad (Plate 168). Located due south of the palace and overlooking the Jumna river, it was built on a high plinth. The location and size of this mosque, along with those constructed by earlier ladies of the court (cf. Plate 116), underscore the status of the patron. The mosque's red and white striped domes and high central*pishtaq,* among other features, are modeled closely on Shah Jahan's Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque (Plate 124). Typical of Aurangzeb's architecture, however, are the tightly constricted necks of the domes and cusped entrance arches supported on slender piers, emphasizing the structure's height.

# PATRONAGE OF THE NOBILITY

*Western India*

### *Ajmer and vicinity*

Aurangzeb paid homage on several occasions at the *dargah* of Mu<sup>c</sup> in al-Din Chishti and continued his predecessors' practice of generously distributing alms there, but added no structures to the shrine. One, however, was built there during his reign. Shaikh cAla al-Din, who until his death was in charge of the shrine, built his tomb in 1659-60 just outside the shrine on its west. Known as the Sola Khamba (Plate 169), this rectangular marble building derives its name from the sixteen columns that support cusped entrance arches. Its three mihrabs are closely modeled on the central one of Shah Jahan's marble mosque immediately to the tomb's east (Plate 106), again underscoring the impact of this mosque on the subsequent architecture of Ajmer. The Sola Khamba, however, introduces cusping, not seen on Shah Jahan's public architecture in Ajmer. This and the increasing number of columns supporting these cusped arches reveal an elaboration of form common to Aurangzeb-penod works.

Another structure bearing the impact of Shah Jahan's Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque is one provided in 1692-93 close to the *dargah* by Sayyid Muhammad, an attendant *(mutawali)* at the saint's tomb. Unlike the Shah Jahan-period mosques on the

Plate 170. Mosque of Sayyid Muhammad, Ajmer

same street, this small single-aisled mosque (Plate 170) is not on ground level, but located above the shops, following contemporary practice in Delhi, suggesting the scarcity of open land. It bears several inscriptions, including a lengthy Persian one inlaid with black stones into a white marble ground. This elegant inscription, designed by Naji, a well-known poet and calhgrapher of Aurangzeb's time, is similar in appearance, location and design to the one on Shahjahan's mosque at the shrine (Plate 105). The mosque itself is a simple yet elegant structure whose facade consists of three cusped arches supported on polygonal columns, a form typical of Aurangzeb-period architecture in Ajmer.

Ranking in quality with imperial works is an exquisite white marble tomb believed to be that of the wife of cAbd Allah Khan (Plate 171). He was the father of the famous Sayyid brothers, who after Aurangzeb's reign were known as the king-makers. Her tomb is modeled closely on those built for imperial princesses, for example, the tomb of Jahan Ara (Plate 167). Like that tomb its cenotaph, surmounted by finely carved screens, is left open to the air. Today it bears no inscription, but a plaque dated 1702-03, now embedded in the wall of c Abd Allah's nearby tomb, refers to the death of a lady and probably once belonged to the white marble tomb. Other inscriptions indicate that a mosque and garden were built in conjunction with the tomb between 1702 and 1704. Later in 1710 cAbd Allah's tomb in the same compound was built by his sons.

Plate 171. cAbd Allah Khan's wife's tomb, Ajmer

Even structures outside of Ajmer reveal an awareness of current Mughal idiom. Among these is the Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque in Merta, about 100 km north of Ajmer (Plate 172). It was built by Hajji Muhammad Sultan, the son of a local religious official, in 1665.28 The mosque, constructed in local red stone, is situated on a high plinth above shops. Very tall minarets, visible from a considerable distance, advertise its presence as do its three bulbous domes. The central one has a tightly constricted neck and is faced with alternating red and white stripes like those on Shah Jahan's Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque in Shahjahanabad built about a decade earlier (Plate 124). The overall effect is an emphasis on verticality and a clear sense of spatial tension such as we see a few years earlier at the Bibi-ka Maqbara at Aurangabad and the Jamic mosque in Mathura, both products of 1660-61 (Plates 166 and 177).

### *Abmadabad*

Aurangzeb, who was born in Ahmadabad, ordered repairs to both Mughal and pre-Mughal buildings there, revealing his interest in the maintenance of older structures, especially mosques. New buildings were constructed on behalf of the Mughal administration by Muhammad Ac zam Shah, a governor of Gujarat.

*<sup>2</sup>S* The mosque bears two inscriptions, but the earlier one seems to refer to a mosque that no longer remains.

![](_page_18_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 172. Jamic mosque, Merta

He erected palace buildings on the Sabarmati river, but no trace of them remains. Also at this time Mughal governors, amirs and religious officials erected religious structures to enhance Mughal presence and at the same time to immortalize their own names. Among these are the mosque and tomb of Sardar Khan, a noble who had gained Aurangzeb's favor during the war of succession, when he prevented Dara Shukoh from entering Ahmadabad. Sardar Khan's tomb (Plate 173) and its adjacent mosque bear features typical of contemporary Mughal architecture, for example, bulbous domes with constricted necks (Plate 168). The mosque's plan, a single-aisled three-bayed form, is common in contemporary Mughal architecture elsewhere but not typical of architecture in Gujarat. The mosque and tomb, however, also display many local features, especially the tomb's screened walls that are modeled on those of the more famous tomb of Shaikh Ahmad Khattu at nearby Sarkhej. The tomb, based largely on local tradition, is domed, unlike the characteristic royal tombs of Aurangzeb's time. Other notable monuments of this time, for example the Hadayat Bakhsh madrasa (1690-1700) and the mosque, madrasa and tomb of Nawab Shujac at Khan (1695), also combine local idiom with standard Mughal vocabulary. Thus in Gujarat throughout the Mughal period most buildings,

![](_page_19_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 173. Sardar Khan's tomb, Ahmadabad

except those built b y princes and the highest-ranking amirs, appear to be products o f local designers.

# *North India*

# *Lahore to Delhi*

Althoug h Aurangze b built his largest mosque in Lahore , he rarely visited the city. In fact, the Frenchman Bernier reported that Lahor e wa s rapidly decaying, probably because the city lacked an imperial presence and had been ravaged b y floods. Al l the same, high-ranking officials and their families con tinued to reside in Lahor e and to embellish the forme r Mugha l capital. Th e most notable structure at this time is the tomb of Da i Anga , dated 1671-72 . She wa s a wet-nurs e wh o served in the imperial court and hence a woma n of considerable stature. In keeping with local techniques, her brick tomb wa s originally covered wit h tiles, but only a few no w remain. Th e tomb is modeled on those seen widel y across the subcontinent. Th e square single-storied structure surmounted b y a single dom e and *chattris* at each corne r is closely related to tombs such as that of Shah Ni <sup>c</sup> m a t Alla h at Gau r built during Shah Jahan's

reign. The tomb's interior arrangement, with a central chamber surrounded by eight smaller ones, is also found throughout the subcontinent at this time. The interior dome (Plate 174), like that of Wazir Khan's nearby mosque, is magnificently polychromed. The tomb is thus a regional version of a general type popular throughout Mughal India.

During the time that Aurangzeb resided in Shahjahanabad, revenue from Kashmir soared, and new serais were needed to support the increased trade.<sup>29</sup> Among these a serai on the road between Lahore and Delhi in Ludhiana District was built in 1669-70 by Lashkar Khan, a general in the military. This serai, known as Serai Lashkar Khan, is a square enclosure entered through massive gates similar to those of Serai Amanat Khan but even larger than the gates of that earlier one. This serai is brick constructed, but devoid of the usual tile ornamentation. Also serving the needs of travelers on this route were deep step-wells *(baolis).* Shortly after Aurangzeb's accession one was excavated at Mahem in Rohtak District. It was built by Saidu, a mace-bearer in the imperial court. Three stages of steps descend to this extremely deep well. On the second level an arched opening overlooks the circular well beyond and serves as a pavilion to catch cooling breezes.

In the foothills north of Delhi, Fidai Khan Koka, the supervisor of the Badshahi mosque in Lahore, built a terraced garden at Pinjaur around a natural spring. Although the exact date of this summer retreat is not known, its pavilions with cusped arches supported on baluster columns, reserved in Shah Jahan's reign solely for buildings intended for the emperor and his immediate family, suggest that the garden was built in Aurangzeb's time. By now such strictures had loosened (Plate 178), probably because Aurangzeb had little desire to associate himself with symbols suggesting a semi-divine status.

# *Delhi to Mathura*

Delhi remained a leading center of culture and learning even after 1681, when Aurangzeb permanently shifted the empire's administration to the Deccan. In Delhi Jahan Ara presided as a patron of sufic learning, and the princess Zeb al-Nisa provided generous patronage for literary figures, theologians, calligraphers and others. cAqil Khan, the governor of Delhi from 1680 to 1696, was a poet and historian, instrumental in maintaining Delhi as a vital cultural center. Delhi's small but wealthy leisure class not only patronized poets and other cultural figures but also built gardens, markets, mosques and magnificent mansions. Among these works was a large caravan serai known as Bakhtawar Nagar, built in 1662 by Bakhtawar Khan outside the city walls.

<sup>29</sup> According to Neera Daraban, *Northern India under Aurangzeb: Social and Economic Condition* (Meerut, 1982), p. 296, the revenue from Kashmir increased greatly during Aurangzeb's reign.

![](_page_21_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 174. Interior dome, tomb of Dai Anga, Lahore

Although Delhi suffered three major fires in 1662, it was mostly the poor, living in crowded conditions, who were affected, while the spacious mansions of the wealthy, modeled on the imperial residence, survived well. New mansions were built during Aurangzeb's reign, while those erected earlier under Shah Jahan also continued to be used, but not necessarily by the same family. Once a noble died his house became state property and was bestowed upon the next inhabitant by the ruler himself. For example, after the leading noble cAli Mardan Khan died, Aurangzeb awarded his mansion to Jahan Ara.

There was little architectural activity far south of the walled city. True, doors were donated at the tomb of Amir Khusrau in the *dargah* of Nizam al-Din Auliya during Aurangzeb's reign. But most building was concentrated close to the western part of the walled city, in proximity to its Lahore and Ajmer gates. The mosque and tomb of Nasir Daulat, built in 1658 but no longer surviving, were just outside the city's now-demolished Lahore gate. Inside the city walls, between the Lahore and Ajmer gates, the Anarwali mosque was built by a pious lady. This mosque as well as the mosque of Khalil, just inside the Ajmer gate, still stand although they have been considerably remodeled. The mosque of Khalil, dated 1698-99, is a single-aisled three-domed structure situated on a high elevated plinth with shops beneath. Small mosques such as this, built

![](_page_22_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 175. Gate from southwest, madrasa of Ghazi al-Din, today Zakir Husain College, Delhi

above shops and towering over the street below, become typical of much mosque architecture from Aurangzeb's period on.

Just outside the city walls other buildings were erected. The *dargah* of Hasan Rasul Nama was established in 1691, some ten years after Aurangzeb had departed from Delhi. A gateway and other additions were made in 1671 at the Tughluq-period Qadam Sharif shrine. This construction, clustered to the city's west and away from the river, was probably on newly developed land, since no earlier Mughal structures were there.

Among these buildings the complex containing the tomb, mosque and madrasa of Ghazi al-Din, immediately beyond the Ajmer gate, is the largest and best preserved. Such a large edifice on this major thoroughfare underscores the notion that this portion of the city had been undeveloped. The school, today housing Zakir Husain College, has been one of Delhi's leading educational institutions since its establishment and is the oldest continuing school in the city. The patron, Mir Shihab al-Din, came to India from Bukhara in 1674. In 1683 he received the title Ghazi al-Din Khan Bahadur for his successful campaigns in the Deccan. Sometime after this date and before his death in 1709 he built his complex in Delhi.

The school is a quadrangular building apparently influenced by traditional Iranian *iour-aiwan* structures, reflecting the patron's Bukhara origins. The

![](_page_23_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 176. Mosque in madrasa of Ghazi al-Din, Delhi

main gate is a massive red sandstone portal, leading to a courtyard on three sides of which are double-storied galleries whose vaulted chambers serve as living quarters. On the east are projecting oriel windows surmounted by curved sloping roofs (Plate 175) inspired by the *bangala* style superstructures of Shah Jahan's palace architecture (Plate 113). The mosque (Plate 176), on the west, is not an extension of the wall, as is usual in Iranian madrasas, but is freestanding. It resembles Zinat al-Nisa's mosque on the river bank built about the same time (Plate 168). The emphasis on verticality is apparent here as well, and devices similar to those at Zinat al-Nisa's mosque are used to achieve this effect. Its three bulbous domes, originally faced with strips of red and black stone, sit on very high constricted necks.

Ghazi al-Din's simple grave, adjacent to the mosque, is enclosed by marble screened walls but has no superstructure to protect it from the elements. This is similar to the type established for the royal family during this period.

The royal court rarely was in Agra, for until 1666 its fort served as Shah Jahan's prison. Thus there was little notable construction here during Aurangzeb's reign. But in nearby Mathura a Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque (Plate 177) of some

![](_page_24_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 177. Jamic mosque, Mathura

significance was constructed in *1660-61* by cAbd al-Nabi Khan, the *faujdar* of the city who later was killed during Jat uprisings. It was in part his death that prompted Aurangzeb to demolish the huge Hindu temple there and to erect in its place the cIdgah discussed earlier (Plate 164).

The Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque, the earliest notable non-imperial mosque of Aurangzeb's reign, is situated on a high plinth in the center of the city. It echoes the verticality and spatial arrangements seen in the contemporary Bibi-ka Maqbara, built by one of Aurangzeb's sons. The mosque's high plinth, tile-covered gateway and towering minarets appear to diminish the small prayer chamber, thus emphasizing the structure's vertical nature in conformity with the imperial style of the time. The courtyard's rectangular pavilions surmounted by *bangala* roofs (Plate 178) also adhere to forms seen in imperial architecture of the period. During Shah Jahan's reign such pavilions had been associated with imperial presence, but very early in Aurangzeb's reign they lost this meaning and are often found on structures built by non-imperial patrons. The rapid adoption of motifs formerly restricted to imperial use appears to be related to Aurangzeb's relative disinterest in forms that originally had been associated

![](_page_25_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 178. Pavilion on courtyard, Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque, Mathura

solely with royalty. It thus appears that there was little centralized direction for artists and patrons, allowing them greater freedom in the use of forms previously charged with exclusive meaning.

The *bangala* roof is also seen early in Aurangzeb's reign on the entrance portal of another sub-imperial mosque. This impressive stone Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque (Plate 179) was provided in 1664-65 by Mu<sup>c</sup> tamad Khan, commander *(qalc adar)* of the Gwalior fort. Located at the fort's base, the stone-faced mosque recalls the plan and elevation of the slightly earlier Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque at Mathura (Plate 177), but not its ornamentation. Although mentioned in no contemporary text, the inscription over the prayer chamber indicates that Mu<sup>c</sup> tamad Khan destroyed a temple associated with the Hindu sage for whom Gwalior was named and in its place constructed the mosque. Inscriptions of this nature during the Mughal period are not common but a few similar ones can be cited: there is one on the Patthar-ki Masjid in Patna. In both cases, however, the destruction stems from no recorded imperial order.

#### *Benares*

Tradition still perpetuated in Benares blames Aurangzeb for destroying many of that city's temples, even though imperial documents indicate that he long had been concerned with maintaining harmony between the Hindu and

![](_page_26_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 179. Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque, Gwalior

Muslim communities there. In fact, there is evidence only for his demolition in 1669 of the Vishvanath temple, built almost certainly by Raja Man Singh during Akbar's reign. Aurangzeb's demolition of the temple was motivated by specific events, not bigotry. One was the rebellion of zamindars in Benares, some of whom may have assisted Maratha Shivaji in his escape from Mughal authorities. It widely was believed that his escape initially had been facilitated in Agra a few years earlier by Jai Singh, Raja Man Singh's great-grandson, thus explaining the destruction of this particular temple. Another was reaction to recent reports of obstructive Brahmins interfering with Islamic teaching. The demolition of the Vishvanath temple, then, was intended as a warning to anti-Mughal factions, in this case troublesome zamindars and Hindu religious leaders who wielded great influence in this city. Moreover, the temple had been built by a Mughal amir, some of whose successors recently had abetted the emperor's most persistent enemy.

The ruined temple then was used as the qibla wall of the large mosque constructed in its place, underscoring Aurangzeb's displeasure with Benares' politically and religiously active Hindu elite. Today this mosque (Plate 180), whose facade is modeled partially on the entrance into the Taj Mahal, is known as the Gyanvapi mosque. The name of the patron is not known and its construction is cited in no Mughal text.

Tradition holds that another mosque of Aurangzeb's reign was constructed

![](_page_27_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 180. Partial facade, Gyanvapi mosque, Benares

on the site of a destroyed temple, although no evidence supports this. Today known as the Jami<sup>c</sup> or Aurangzeb's mosque (Plate 181), it dominates the famous Benares riverfront. Located at the top of the very steep steps leading to Panchganga Ghat, the mosque was even more visible and clearly symbolized a powerful Muslim presence in this holiest of all Hindu cities when its very tall minarets still stood. Inscriptions of later date record repairs to the mosque, but none reveals its original construction date or patron. Yet it is characteristic of Aurangzeb-period architecture. The proportionately tall height of this threedomed mosque and its now-missing minarets emphasized the structure's verticality. Unusually refined, the stone-faced mosque is a single-aisled threebayed type usually associated with private, not imperial, patronage. Its brown stone facing is delicately carved with niches and arches. The finely rendered stucco, stone and polychrome work suggest a patron of fine taste and great wealth.

# *Eastern India*

*Bihar*

The flourishing trade of Bihar and the relatively calm political climate made conditions here ripe for building activity. For example, Da<sup>c</sup> ud Khan Quraishi,

# *1-79*

![](_page_28_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 181. Jamic mosque, also known as Aurangzeb's mosque, Benares

governor of Bihar from 16 5 9 to 1664, provided structures himself and by example encouraged others to do so as well. He ended the last significant source of on-going opposition to Mughal authority in Bihar by conquering Palamau, inhabited by Chero rajas. Inside the Cheros' seventeenth-century fort, whose elegant gates had been built during Shah Jahan's reign, Da<sup>c</sup> ud Khan constructed a brick mosque in 1660. A single-aisled three-bayed structure surmounted by three low rounded domes, this mosque lacks the sophistication of the fort itself and other contemporary projects, possibly a result of its hasty construction. Nevertheless, it served as a powerful indicator of Mughal presence in this newly conquered territory.

Da<sup>c</sup> ud Khan's serai (Plate 182), in contrast to his Palamau mosque, is finely built. He constructed it with the emperor's permission for the protection of travelers in a robber infested area. This brick serai is in the town still called Daudnagar (Aurangabad District). It remains today the best-preserved example of seventeenth-century secular architecture in Bihar. The serai is entered on the east and west sides by arched portals with chamfered sides, recalling earlier Mughal portals at the Ajmer fort built around 1570. Details, however, such as the stone pillars and cusped arches recalling those on the Sangi Dalan built about a decade earlier in Rajmahal have a more contemporary air. So do the small domed *chattris* atop the portal roof that probably derive from those on the gateway into the Taj Mahal complex.

![](_page_29_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 182. Entrance, Da<sup>c</sup> ud Khan's serai, Daudnagar

A second example of secular architecture was built in Bihar Sharif for Shaikha, a member of the Afghan Ghakkar tribe, many of whom had lived in Bihar since the early sixteenth century. Called the Nauratan (Plate 183), it was built in 1688-89. The main building in the Nauratan compound is a singlestoried flat-roofed square-plan structure. The interior arrangement, however, is familiar throughout Mughal India (Plate 74). That is, a central domed chamber is surrounded by eight ancillary vaulted rooms, a total of nine chambers, the source of the building's name, Nauratan, or nine jewels. Beside this building, others in the compound include a tank with underground chambers, a mosque and domestic quarters, some of which are still extant. The building, today a school, provides a rare view of the predilections of the upper class in the late seventeenth century.

Throughout Aurangzeb's reign, buildings were constructed in Patna, the capital of Bihar. Only one of them, however, is credited, at least by its inscription, to Aurangzeb himself. That is the Rauza mosque dated 1667-68. It is, in fact, the only Mughal building in all Bihar that claims imperial Mughal sponsorship. This simple single-aisled three-bayed mosque was built in conjunction with the graves of two saints. It adheres closely to the form established by the early seventeenth-century mosque of Mirza Ma<sup>c</sup> sum. In spite of the brief inscription, the Rauza mosque's unpretentious style and plan suggest that it

![](_page_30_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 183. Nauratan, Bihar Sharif

was built in response to a general order encouraging the construction of mosques, but was not actually paid for by the ruler. Aurangzeb was never in Patna, nor did he construct mosques at sites with which he did not have a strong personal interest.

Unlike the simple Rauza mosque, one constructed nearly twenty years later by Khwaja cAmber, in the service of the empire's highest-ranking noble, Shaista Khan, features the most elaborate stucco work on any Patna structure of this time. However, the decor of this mosque, dated 1688-89, is considerably more subdued than contemporary ornament elsewhere. Here only the interior of the domes is intricately embellished (Plate 184), recalling similar designs on the Benares Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque or the Bibi-ka Maqbara in Aurangabad built at the beginning of Aurangzeb's reign. This contrasts with the more characteristically austere architecture of Mughal Bihar, generally unembellished by contrast with contemporary architecture in the Mughal Bengal capitals of Dhaka or Rajmahal.

#### *Bengal*

Although most of Bengal had been under Mughal rule since Jahangir's time, Assam, Cooch Behar and Chittagong lay outside the grasp of Mughal

![](_page_31_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 184. Interior of dome, mosque of Khwaja cAmber, Patna

authority. Cooch Behar and Assam, territories to the north of Mughal Bengal, were conquered in the early 1660s. At that time temples were destroyed and mosques established, again for political purposes. Assam was eventually lost again, never to be consolidated into the Mughal empire. To the southeast, however, Buzurg Umed Khan, the son of the empire's leading noble, Shaista Khan, conquered Chittagong, on the southeast coast of Bengal. The Mughals long had vied with local rajas and Portuguese adventurers for Chittagong. When Buzurg Umed Khan secured it for the Mughals in 1666, it became a Mughal headquarters. There in 1668 he completed a Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque modeled on ones at Dhaka, although today it has undergone considerable change.

For some twenty years, Rajmahal had been the capital of Bengal under the governorship of Prince Shah Shujac . When Aurangzeb assumed the throne, Shujac was pursued into the jungles of Assam where he died. Aurangzeb's governor then abandoned Rajmahal, by then associated with the nowdisgraced Shujac . As a result, nearby Gaur, too, lost much of its significance, although one notable monument was constructed there, probably early in Aurangzeb's reign. It is the tomb of Fateh Khan (Plate 185), a noble associated with Shah Shujac and his spiritual mentor Shah Ni<sup>c</sup> mat Allah. Fateh Khan's

![](_page_32_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 185. Tomb of Fateh Khan, Gaur

rectangular tomb is surmounted by a deeply sloped *bangala* roof and appears to be the first extant example in Bengal of a Mughal structure that is entirely covered with this roof type, commonly believed to have originated here.

The capital was moved to Dhaka, which once again became the premier city of Bengal. Construction in Dhaka, long a major trade center, increased. It was at this time that one of Dhaka's most famous monuments, known today as the Lalbagh fort, was built. Its construction is credited to Shaista Khan and Prince c Azim al-Shan, Mughal governors of Bengal from 1678 to 1684. Within this compound, designed as a four-part garden, they built the tomb of Bibi Pari, an audience hall (Plate 186) and attached *hammam,* a tank, enclosure walls and gates. Since the mosque within the walls is dated 1649, however, the present compound was probably built on the foundations of an earlier site. There is considerable empty space within the walls, and no residential quarters are apparent.

The structures in this compound as well as their axial layout adhere to the imperial Mughal idiom. The appearance of the audience hall closely follows that of the Sangi Dalan in Rajmahal (Plate 155) as well as the viewing pavilion in the Agra fort. Bibi Pari's tomb is modeled on that of Shah Ni<sup>c</sup> mat Allah in Gaur, which in turn is inspired by the tomb of I<sup>c</sup> timad al-Daula in Agra (Plate

![](_page_33_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 186. Audience Hall, Lalbagh, Dhaka

71). However, the placement of Bibi Pari's tomb adjacent to the audience hall is quite out of place. Although it reputedly contains the remains of Shaista Khan's favorite daughter, Bibi Pari, that does not explain the unorthodox location of the tomb.

Despite the fact that the compound is almost universally called the Lalbagh fort, it more closely resembles an elaborate walled garden, for example, the c Amm Khass Bagh in Sirhind, though the Lalbagh is not terraced. No structure in the compound is inappropriate to a garden. As was the case with most imperial gardens, it appears originally to have been intended for ceremonial and administrative purposes as well as for pleasure. In the life of a prince, these functions were not entirely discrete.

Dhaka, like the other Mughal urban centers, has several surviving mosques belonging to Aurangzeb's reign. Among them is the Satgumbad mosque (Plate 187), uninscribed but traditionally credited to Shaista Khan. Others include the mosque of Hajji Khwaja Shahbaz built in 1678-79, the mosque of Kar Talab Khan (the future Murshid Quli Khan) constructed between 1700 and 1704, and the mosque of Khan Muhammad Mirza dated 1704-05 (Plate 188). All these are single-aisled, multi-bayed mosques surmounted by domes. Both their interior and exterior surfaces are significantly more articulated than Bengali buildings of Shah Jahan's time, in fact more elaborate than mosques of eastern India in general, which are conservatively embellished (Plates 94 and 151). Their surface

![](_page_34_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 187. Satgumbad mosque, Dhaka

is usually a plaster veneer over a brick core, not the more impressive stone facing used for many imperial structures.

Increased articulation of surfaces is seen, for example, on the projecting corner turrets of the Satgumbad mosque. On Kar Talab Khan's mosque, the rectangular chambers surmounted with deeply sloped and curved *bangala* roofs flank the north and south ends. These recall the tomb of Fateh Khan in Gaur, built at the beginning of Aurangzeb's reign (Plate 185). Earlier mosques in Bengal have only two engaged columns on the east facade, while there are four on the Hajji Khwaja Shahbaz mosque, six on the Khan Muhammad Mirza mosque dated less than forty years later, and even more on the larger Kar Talab Khan mosque. Other innovations of the period include cusped entrance arches on the facade and mihrabs with cusped arches supported on engaged colonettes with bulbous bases. More elaborate is the interior of the Hajji Khwaja Shahbaz mosque (Plate 189). Its mihrabs have ornate cusped arches supported by slender colonettes and cusped transverse arches that contrast to the plain ones of Shah Jahan's time.

Burdwan was another city in Bengal long associated with the Mughals. Here Nur Jahan's first husband was killed and buried. Later the capture of Burdwan gave the rebel prince Shah Jahan all Bengal. In 1698, Khwaja Anwar-i Shahid, a

![](_page_35_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 188. Mosque of Khan Muhammad Mirza, Dhaka

noble in the service of Prince cAzim al-Shan, then governor of Bengal, was ambushed and killed in Burdwan. It is popularly believed that after this incident the prince built the Burdwan Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque, dated 1699-1700, as a gesture of thanksgiving, since apparently he was the target, not the Khwaja. However, cAzim al-Shan's name is not mentioned in the inscription, and the heavy unrefined features of this mosque do not suggest princely patronage.

Although the mosque in Burdwan is not an outstanding structure, the tomb complex of Khwaja Anwar-i Shahid is the most refined monument in all Mughal Bengal. This complex includes a splendid gateway, tank, mosque, madrasa and the tomb itself (Plate 190), all within a walled enclosure. Even though tradition states that the tomb complex was built in 1712 by the future emperor Farrukh Siyar, also in Burdwan at the time of the ambush, it may have been the product of cAzim al-Shan's princely patronage. The three-bayed mosque's highly articulated interior is replete with cusped niches. Such ornateness is unprecedented on any seventeenth- or early eighteenth-century Bengali mosque and is probably inspired by imperial architecture such as Aurangzeb's Badshahi mosque in Lahore (Plate 163). The interior of this Burdwan mosque probably served as a basis for later eighteenth-century architecture in Murshidabad. The tomb, however, is the most creative structure in

![](_page_36_Picture_1.jpeg)

Plate 189. Interior, mosque of Hajji Khwaja Shahbaz, Dhaka

the complex. Its format, unique in India, consists of a square single-domed central chamber with rectangular-plan wings on the east and west sides crowned by *bangala* roofs. The tomb's plastered facade is covered with cusped medallions and niches as well as finely incised geometric patterns that recall the exterior of Sultan Nisar Begum's tomb in Allahabad.

Despite Aurangzeb's reputed anti-Hindu stance and ban on temple building, in fact terracotta temples were constructed in Bengal in unprecedented numbers. There are nearly forty dated terracotta temples and many others as well. A variety of types was produced. The facades of most of these temples are profusely embellished with images of deities and genre scenes indicating the strength of the Hindu visual tradition.

The founding of Calcutta by Job Charnock in 1690 and its subsequent fortification, although of little significance during Aurangzeb's reign, were ultimately to affect the future of the Mughal empire and its successor states. For the next 150 years in Bengal, three rich building traditions - Mughal-type mosques, Hindu temples and British secular structures - made this eastern area the most diverse in all north India.

#### *Aurangabad*

Although Aurangzeb spent the last twenty years of his reign in the Deccan, and Aurangabad served as the primary royal residence after the move south in 1681, little survives from this time. Unlike the north, where nobles generally followed imperial lead in providing architecture, few apparently did so in the Deccan. The Mughal situation there was not sufficiently stable to make architectural construction a prudent investment.

Among the few structures provided by nobles at this time are two mosques constructed in Aurangabad shortly after 1661, when Rabic a Daurani's tomb was built (Plate 166). In 1661—62 the Chowk mosque was provided by Shaista Khan, noted for his architectural patronage throughout the empire.<sup>30</sup> A doubleaisled structure of five bays each, the simple mosque is surmounted by a single dome. It is modeled on the nearby Jami<sup>c</sup> mosque dated 1615-16, built before Mughal presence here, and so shows few Mughal characteristics. Shaista Khan probably used a locally trained architect and took little part in its construction.

Much more in the Mughal mode is the Lai mosque (Plate 191) provided in 1665-66 by a government official, Zain al-Abidin. The plan of the Lai mosque is almost identical to that of the Chowk mosque built in the local idiom.

However, the cusped arches of the facade supported on bulbous balusterinspired columns are within the Mughal tradition. The use of these features was probably inspired by a mosque in the compound of Rabic a Daurani's tomb. Other structures in Aurangabad that appear to date to Aurangzeb's time include the Panchakki, a garden and reservoir complex built around a saint's shrine, and a small white mosque, now part of a girls' school, with cusping and columns similar to those on a mosque at Rabic a Daurani's tomb.

# CONCLUSION

Aurangzeb was much less involved in architectural production than his predecessors were, but he did sponsor important monuments, especially religious ones. Most notable are mosques that date prior to the court's shift to the Deccan. Some of these, such as the cIdgah at Mathura, were built by the ruler himself, others by his nobles to proclaim Mughal authority in the face of opposition. On Aurangzeb's palace mosque we see an elaboration of floral and other patterns derived from those on Shah Jahan's palace pavilions. But these forms are no longer intended to suggest the semi-divine character of ruler, a notion that little concerned Aurangzeb.

# CONCLUSION

architecture is rejected in favor of an increased sense of spatial tension with an emphasis on height. Stucco and other less expensive materials emulating the marble and inlaid stone of earlier periods cover built surfaces. Immediately after Aurangzeb's accession, the use of forms and motifs such as the baluster column and the *bangala* canopy, earlier reserved for the ruler alone, are found on non-imperially sponsored monuments. This suggests both that there was relatively little imperial intervention in architectural patronage and that the vocabulary of imperial and divine symbolism established by Shah Jahan was devalued by Aurangzeb. At the same time architectural activity by the nobility proliferated as never before, suggesting that they were eager to fill the role previously dominated by the emperor.
