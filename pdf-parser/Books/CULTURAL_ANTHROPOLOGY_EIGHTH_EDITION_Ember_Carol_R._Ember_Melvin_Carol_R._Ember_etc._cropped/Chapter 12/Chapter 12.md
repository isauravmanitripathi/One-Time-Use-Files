# Associations and Interest Groups

![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg)

Samuel Johnson, the eighteenth-century English author, was once asked to describe James Boswell, his companion and biographer. "Boswell," he boomed, "is a very clubable man." Johnson did not mean that Boswell deserved to be attacked with bludgeons. He was referring to Boswell's fondness for all sorts of clubs and associations, a fondness he shared with many of his contemporaries. The tendency to form associations was not unique to eighteenth-century England. At all times and in all areas of the world, we find evidence of human beings' "clubability."

The notion of clubs may make us think of something extracurricular and not terribly important, but associations play very important roles in the economy and political life of many societies. In this chapter, we examine the various kinds of associations formed in different societies, how these groups function, and what general purposes they serve. When we speak of **associations**, we mean different kinds of groups that are not based on kinship, as in the preceding chapter, or on territory, as in the next chapter. Associations, then, are nonkin and nonterritorial groups. And, although they vary a lot, they also have several common characteristics: (1) some kind of formal, institutionalized structure; (2) the exclusion of some people; (3) members with common interests or purposes; and (4) members with a discernible sense of pride and feeling of belonging. Contemporary American society has an abundance of interest groups-to use the terminology of the political scientist-that display these general characteristics of associations. Such groups vary considerably in size and social significance, ranging from national organizations such as the Democratic and Republican parties to more local organizations such as college sororities and fraternities.

But societies differ considerably in the degree to which they have such associations and, if they do have them, in what kind they have. To make our discussion somewhat easier, we focus on two dimensions of how associations vary from one society to another. One is whether recruitment into the association is voluntary or not. In our society, with the exception of the government's right to draft men into the military, just about all our associations are voluntary—that is, people can choose to join or not join. But in many societies, particularly the more egalitarian ones, membership is nonvoluntary: all people of a particular category must belong.

A second dimension of variation in associations is what qualifies a person for membership. There are two possible kinds of qualifications: those that are achieved and those that are ascribed.

Achieved qualities are those an individual acquires during his or her lifetime, such as superior skills in a sport or the skills required to be an electrician. Ascribed qualities are those determined for a person at birth, either because of genetic makeup (for instance, sex) or because of family background (for instance, ethnicity, place of birth, religion, social class). We speak of two kinds of ascribed qualities or characteristics: universally ascribed qualities, those that are found in all societies (such as age and sex), and variably ascribed qualities, those that are found only in some societies (such as ethnic, religious, or social-class differences). Table 12-1 gives these two dimensions of variation in associations (voluntary versus nonvoluntary recruitment and criteria for membership) and some kinds of associations that fit neatly into our classification. Of course, some associations do not fit so neatlyfor example, the criteria that qualify someone for Girl Scout membership include an interest in joining (an achieved quality) as well as biological sex (an ascribed characteristic).

## NONVOLUNTARY ASSOCIATIONS

Although complex societies may have nonvoluntary associations, such associations are more characteristic of relatively unstratified or egalitarian societies. In relatively unstratified societies, associations tend to be based on the universally ascribed characteris-

tics of age and sex. Such associations take two forms: age-sets and male or female (unisex) associations.

#### Age-Sets

All societies use a vocabulary of age terms, just as they use a vocabulary of kinship terms. For instance, as we distinguish among brother, uncle, and cousin, so we differentiate infant, adolescent, and adult. Age terms refer to categories based on age, or age-grades. An **age-grade** is simply a category of persons who happen to fall within a particular, culturally distinguished age range. Age-set, on the other hand, is the term for a group of persons of similar age and the same sex who move through some or all of life's stages together. For example, all the boys of a certain age range in a particular district might simultaneously become ceremonially initiated into "manhood." Later in life, the group as a whole might become "elders," and still later "retired elders." Entry into an age-set system is generally nonvoluntary and is based on the universally ascribed characteristics of sex and age.

Kinship forms the basis of the organization and administration of most noncommercial societies. In some societies, however, age-sets crosscut kinship ties and form strong supplementary bonds. Two such societies are the Karimojong of East Africa and the Shavante of Brazil.

Karimojong Age-Sets. The Karimojong number some 60,000 people. Predominantly cattle herders, they occupy about 4,000 acres of semiarid country in northeastern Uganda. Their society is especially interesting because of its organization into combinations of age-sets and generationsets. These groupings provide "both the source of political authority and the main field within which it is exercised."1

A Karimojong age-set comprises all the men who have been initiated into manhood within a span of about five to six years. A generation-set consists of a combination of five such age-sets, covering twenty-five to thirty years. Each generation-set is seen as "begetting" the one that immediately follows it, and at any one time two generation-sets are in

Some circumstances have changed, but the age-sets of the Nandi of Kenya still have importance. This warrior-aged Nandi man (in a suit) is told by a traditional spiritual leader (in a skin cloak): "In the past, when our young warriors went out for the first time, we gave them spears and shields and told them to bring back wealth to the community. Today we give you a pen and paper and ask the same."

corporate existence. The senior unit—whose members perform the administrative, judicial, and priestly functions—is closed; the junior unit, whose members serve as warriors and police, is still recruiting. When all five age-sets in the junior generationset are established, that generation-set will be ready (actually impatient) to assume the status of its senior predecessor. Eventually, grumbling but realistic, the elders will agree to a succession ceremony, moving those who were once in a position of obedience to a position of authority.

The Karimojong age system, then, comprises a cyclical succession of four generation-sets in a predetermined continuing relationship. The retired generation-set consists of elders who have passed on the mantle of authority, since most of the five age-sets within the retired generation-set are depleted, if not defunct. The senior generation-set contains the five age-sets that actively exercise authority. The junior generation-set is still recruiting members and, although obedient to elders, has some administrative powers. The noninitiates are starting a generation-set. Figure 12-1 illustrates the Karimojong age system.

Once initiated, a boy has become a man, one with a clearly defined status and the ultimate certainty of exercising full authority together with his set partners. Indeed, a Karimojong is not expected

#### FIGURE 12-1

The Karimojong age system is composed of four distinct generation-sets (labeled A, B, C, and D in this diagram), which succeed each other cyclically. Each generation-set, in turn, is divided into five age-sets or potential age-sets. The senior generation-set  $(A)$  exercises authority. The junior age set (B)—the warriors and policemen—is still recruiting. Generation-set D consists of retired age-sets. Noninitiated and not-yet-born boys constitute the potential age-sets C1-C5.

to marry—and is certainly barred from starting a family-until he has been initiated. The initiation ceremony itself illustrates the essential political and social characteristics of the age-set system. Without the authority of the elders, the ceremony cannot be held; throughout the proceedings their authority is explicit. The father-son relationship of adjacent generation-sets is emphasized, for fathers are initiating their sons.

Shavante Age-Sets. The Shavante inhabit the Mato Grasso region of Brazil. Until recently, they were extremely hostile to Brazilians of European ancestry who tried to move into their territory. It was not until the 1950s that peaceful contact with the 2,000 or so Shavante was achieved. Although the Shavante have some agriculture, they rely primarily on food collection. Wild roots, nuts, and fruits are their staple foods, and hunting is their passion.<sup>2</sup> The Shavante have villages, but they rarely stay in them for more than a few weeks at a time. Instead they make frequent community treks lasting six to twenty-four weeks to hunt or collect. They spend no more than four weeks a year at their gardens, which are located at least a day's journey from the villages.

Age-sets are an extremely important part of Shavante society, particularly for males. Boys emerge from the status of childhood when they are formally inducted into a named age-set and take up residence in the "bachelor hut." An induction ceremony takes place every five years, and boys from seven to twelve years of age are inducted at the same time. The five-year period of residence in the bachelor hut is relatively free of responsibility: the boys' families provide food for them, and they go out hunting and collecting when they feel like it. But during the five-year period they are instructed in hunting, weapon making, and ceremonial skills. At the end of this period, a much more elaborate series of initiation ceremonies marks the entry by these boys into a different status—that of "young men." The day they emerge from the bachelor hut for the last time, during the final rites of initiation, the whole age-set is married, each to a small girl, usually not yet mature, chosen by the boys' parents. Marriages cannot be consummated at this time, because the young men must wait until their wives are more mature. When the ceremonies are over, the young men make war clubs, for they are thought of now as the warriors of the community, and they earn the privilege of sitting in the evening village council. But they have no authority at this stage and few responsibilities.

The next stage is that of the "mature men," and when an age-set is inducted into this stage the members begin to experience some authority. It is in the mature men's council that important community decisions are made. This last status position actually consists of five consecutive age-sets (because new age-sets are formed every five years and each one continues in existence until the death of its members). Among the mature men the oldest sets are considered senior to the younger ones. Members of the most junior mature men's age-set rarely talk in the council; they assert themselves more as they progress in the system.

In contrast to the Karimojong, who have agesets just for males, the Shavante also have them for females. Shavante girls are inducted into an age-set when boys about their age enter the bachelor hut, but they belong to the age-set in name only. They do not participate in the bachelor hut (nor do they have their own equivalent), they are not initiated, and they cannot participate in the village council, which makes community decisions. About the only thing the age-set gives them is occasional participation with males in a few ceremonies. For Shavante women, then, the age-set system does not function as an association.

#### Unisex Associations

Unisex, as used here, has quite a different meaning from its current connotation in our own society, where it signifies something that is suitable for both sexes. We use the word **unisex** to describe a type of association that restricts its membership to one sex, usually male. Sex as a qualification is directly related to the purpose of the unisex association. In many male unisex associations, this purpose is to strengthen the concept of male superiority and to offer men a refuge from females. In noncommercial societies, men's associations are similar to age-sets, except that there are only two sets, or stages—mature males, who are association members, and immature males, who are nonmembers. Like societies with agesets, societies with male unisex associations are very likely to have traumatic and dramatic male ceremonies initiating males into the group of "mature" men. We will discuss these ceremonies further in the chapter on psychology and culture.

In most noncommercial societies, women have few associations perhaps because in such societies the men are dominant in the kinship, property, and political spheres of life. (There is also the possibility that anthropologists, most of whom were

men, have given women's associations less attention than men's associations.) In some partly commercialized economies, such as in West Africa, women's associations are more common.<sup>3</sup> Unisex associations or clubs are also a feature of very industrialized societies. The Boy Scouts and the Kiwanis, the Girl Scouts and the League of Women Voters, are cases in point. Admission to these clubs, however, is voluntary; in noncommercial and less complex societies, recruitment is more often nonvoluntary.

Mae Enga Bachelor Associations. The Mae Enga are a subgroup of about 30,000 sedentary horticulturalists living in the New Guinea highlands. Their society has received a great deal of attention from anthropologists for its practice of sexual segregation-indeed, for the strain of active hostility to women that runs through its culture.<sup>4</sup> It is the custom for Mae men to live in a separate, communal house. Up to the age of five, a young boy is permitted to live in his mother's house, although he is unconsciously aware of the "distance" between his father and mother. As he grows older, this awareness is made explicit by his father and elder clansmen. It is undesirable, he is told, to be so much in the company of women; it is better that he join the menfolk in their house and in their activities. As the boy grows up, the need to avoid contact with women is made abundantly clear to him. He is told that contact with menstrual blood or menstruating women, if not countered by magic rites, can "pollute" a man. It can "corrupt his vital juices so that his skin darkens and wrinkles and his flesh wastes, permanently dull his wits, and eventually lead to a slow decline and death."5

Because Mae culture regards a woman as potentially unclean, to say the least, it enforces strict codes of male-female behavior. These codes are designed to safeguard male integrity, strength, and possession of crops and other property. So strict are these regulations that many young men are reluctant to marry. But the elders do try to impress upon the young men their duty to marry and reproduce. The men's association attempts to regulate the males' sexual relationships. The association is said to have several purposes: to cleanse and strengthen its members; to promote their growth; to make them attractive to women; and, most important, to supervise contact between the sexes so that ultimately the "right" wives are procured for the men and the "right" children are born into the clan.

By the time he is fifteen or sixteen, a Mae youth has joined the village bachelors' association. He agrees to take scrupulous care neither to copulate with a woman nor to accept food from her hands. As a club member, he will participate in the sanggai rituals. Bachelors, under the supervision of senior club members, go into seclusion, in a clubhouse deep in the forest, to undergo "purification." During four days of "exercises" (which are rather similar in purpose to those of a religious retreat), each youth observes additional prohibitions to protect himself from all forms of sexuality and impurity. For instance, pork is denied him (women have cared for the pigs), and he may not look at the ground during excursions into the forest, lest he see feminine footprints or pig feces. His body will be scrubbed, his dreams discussed and interpreted. Finally, together with his club, now restored to purity and reprotected at least for a while against contamination, he will participate in organized dances and feasting with his chosen lady.

The sanggai festivals afford the entire clan an opportunity to display its size, solidarity, and magnificence to its enemies, whom on other occasions it fights. Hostility toward women may not be surprising in view of the fact that a man's wife and mother come from neighboring clans (the Mae clan villages are exogamous) perpetually in conflict with his own. Male-female hostility, then, seems to reflect the broader, interclan hostility. The Mae have a succinct way of describing the situation: "We marry the people we fight."<sup>6</sup>

Men's houses, and occasionally women's, are found among many peoples, especially in Melanesia, Polynesia, Africa, and South America. Men's associations generally involve bachelors, although older married men will often come by to instruct the youngsters and pass on the benefits of their experience. In more militant days, men's houses acted as fortresses and arsenals—even as sanctuaries for fugitives. By and large, they serve to strengthen-certainly to symbolize—male power and solidarity. As do age-sets, men's clubs often provide ties that cut across and supplement kinship bonds. Hence, they permit a given group of men in a given society to act together toward the realization of mutually agreedupon objectives, irrespective of kin relationships.

Poro and Sande. There is usually some secrecy in all associations, as in social life in general. In the examples we discussed above, many of the details of male initiation ceremonies usually are kept secret. But more secrecy seems to be required in the Poro and Sande associations of West Africa.

The Poro and Sande associations exist in several cultural groups that speak Mande languages and are located in what is now Liberia, Sierra Leone, the Ivory Coast, and Guinea. In Guinea, the Poro and the Sande were recently declared illegal, but in the other countries they are not only legal—they are an integral part of local political structure. Membership in them is public and nonvoluntary; all men in the community must belong to the Poro, and all women must belong to the Sande.7

Where the Poro and the Sande associations are legal, the community has two political structures-the "secular" and the "sacred." The secular structure consists of the town chief, neighborhood and kin group headmen, and elders. The sacred structure, or Zo, consists of the hierarchies of "priests" in the Poro and Sande associations. Among the Kpelle of Liberia, for example, the Poro and Sande Zo take turns in assuming responsibility for dealing with in-town fighting, murder, rape, incest, and disputes over land.

So in what sense are the Poro and Sande secret? If all adults belong to them, their membership and what they do can hardly be described as secret. Furthermore, anthropologists have not only written about these associations; some have even joined them. Beryl Bellman, who joined the Poro of the Kpelle,<sup>8</sup> suggested that what is "secret" about these associations is the necessity for members to learn to keep secrets, particularly about how people are initiated into membership. Only when people learn to keep secrets are they considered trustworthy for participation in political life.

The Poro leadership establishes the place where the initiates will undergo scarification and live in seclusion for about a year (formerly it was three or four years). The boys are taken out of town, where they engage in a mock battle with a *ngamu* (a member of the Poro masquerading as a forest "devil") who incises marks on their necks, chests, and backs. These marks symbolize being killed and eaten by the devil; but then the initiates are "reborn." In the initiation "village" outside of town, the boys learn crafts, hunting, and the use of basic medicines. The children of the Zo are given special instruction so that they can take over the rituals from their fathers. Some are trained to perform as "devils." At the end of the year, the initiates are given Poro names, by which they will be known from then on. Secrecy is attached to events surrounding the initiates; everyone knows that the boys are not killed and eaten by the devil, but only some can speak of it. For example, women must say that the boys are in the devil's stomach; if they say otherwise, they might be killed in punishment.<sup>9</sup>

The initiation of females into the Sande also involves taking the initiates into the forest for a year (formerly three years). The girls not only undergo scarification; they also undergo a clitoridectomy (removal of the clitoris). Like the boys, the girls receive training in adult activities. In the years just before and during the Sande initiation (which occurs every seven years or so), the women are responsible for the moral behavior of the community. Persons who commit crimes are first brought before the women; if a man is the accused, he is tried by the Poro Zo, but a portion of any fine is given to the women.<sup>10</sup>

The Poro and Sande Zo are held in great respect, and the devils are viewed with fear and awe for the powers they possess. Some authors suggest that fear of the Poro and the Sande strengthens the hands of secular political authority, because chiefs and landowners occupy the most powerful positions in the associations.<sup>11</sup>

Secret associations are common in many areas of the world-the Pacific, North and South America, as well as various parts of Africa-although they may be voluntary organizations in some places. In Africa, according to a recent crosscultural study, secret associations are usually involved in political activities, as are the Poro and Sande. These activities punish persons who, according to the secret society, have committed some wrongs. The fact that the punished persons almost never seem to be members of the native elite or foreign rulers supports the observation about the Poro and Sande that they typically strengthen the hand of existing political authority.<sup>12</sup>

Ijaw Women's Associations. Among the Ijaw of southern Nigeria, only women in the northern part of this society are organized into associations. In one northern Ijaw village there are seven women's associations.<sup>13</sup> Once a married woman shows herself capable of supporting a household independent of her mother-in-law, which she does by engaging in marketing and trading, she has to belong to the women's association linked to her husband's patrilineage. Membership in such an association is nonvoluntary; all eligible women must join, and members are fined if they do not come to meetings or come late.

The women's associations act as mediators in disputes and impose punishments even in cases that have gone to court. For example, an association may impose fines for "crimes" such as defaming a woman's character or adultery. An association may also adopt rules for proper behavior. Judgments and rules are arrived at by consensus of all the women members. If a punished member does not accept a judgment, the other members might get together and taunt the woman or take some important item

Before the competition a Samba "school" participates in a parade. To become champion is like winning the Superbowl in the United States.

from her house and refuse to have anything to do with her.

Some of the larger associations also act as lending institutions, using their cash reserves from fines to lend to members or nonmembers at an interest rate of 50 percent or more. Even a male in debt to the association might be held captive in his own house until he pays his debt. (It is no wonder, then, that few resist an association's judgment for long.) Although it is not clear why women's associations such as the Ijaw's are common in West Africa, one of the factors that may have been important is the women's participation in marketing and trade, which allows them to be financially independent of men.

We shall see in the next section that women are increasingly forming voluntary self-help groups to improve themselves economically.

## VOLUNTARY ASSOCIATIONS

Voluntary associations such as the military associations of the Cheyenne of North America (see below) may be found in some relatively simple societies. But voluntary associations tend to be more common in stratified and complex societies, presumably because stratified societies are composed of people with many different, and often competing, interests. We deal here with some examples of voluntary associations that are not familiar in American experience.

#### **Military Associations**

Military associations in noncommercial societies may be compared to our own American Legion or Veterans of Foreign War posts. They all seem to exist to unite members through their common experiences as warriors, to glorify the activities of war, and to perform certain services for the community. Membership in such associations is usually voluntary and based on the achieved criterion of participation in war. Among the North American Plains Indians, military societies were common. The Cheyenne, for example, had military associations that were not ranked by age, but were open to any boy or man ready to go to war.<sup>14</sup>

In the beginning of the nineteenth century the Cheyenne had five military associations: the Fox, the Dog, the Shield, the Elk (or Hoof Rattle), and the Bowstring (or Contrary). The last-named association was annihilated by the Pawnee in the middle of the nineteenth century. Later, two new associations were established, the Wolf and the Northern Crazy Dogs. Although the various associations may have had different costumes, songs, and dances, they were alike in their internal organization, each being headed by four leaders who were among the most important war chiefs.

Several of the Cheyenne military associations selected four virgin daughters of tribal leaders to serve as "maids of honor." These girls participated in the associations' ceremonies and sat with the war chiefs during council meetings. Although women had no political authority, they were highly respected among the Cheyenne. The maids of honor of the military associations were looked upon as reflecting the ideals of female chastity and deportment. So important was the virtue of female chastity among the Cheyenne that a defiled maid of honor was believed to bring bad luck to the warriors of the association. As a result, the Dog and Contrary associations were unwilling to take the risk of having maids of honor affiliated with them.

When various Plains groups were confined to reservations, the military associations lost many of their old functions. But they did not entirely disappear. For example, among the Lakota, warrior soci-

#### DO SEPARATE WOMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS INCREASE WOMEN'S STATUS AND POWER?

Some women's associations, like those of the Ijaw of southern Nigeria, are reported to have considerable power. Do women generally have more power where women create and join their own associations? We might assume that the existence of such organizations would increase the status of women overall, or at least lead to more equality with men. But it could also be argued the other way around, that "separate" does not generally lead to more equality; it may just increase separateness. As far as we know, researchers have not yet tried to assess the cross-cultural effect of women's associations on female status in various domains of life, but there has been one crosscultural attempt to see if the presence of women's associations predicts various aspects of women's participation in the political process.

Marc Howard Ross looked at four aspects of women's political participation: (1) the degree of inequality between women's and men's participation in public or community decision making; (2) the degree to which women participate in politics privately, (3) the degree to which women have access to positions of authority, and (4) the degree to which women have separate associations that are under their exclusive control. It is this last domain that concerns us here. Does the presence of separate women's associations increase women's participation in public decision making and their access to positions of authority? Ross's crosscultural data indicate that the answer is no. The presence of separate women's organizations does not generally increase the participation of women in public decision making, their access to positions of authority, or even their private participation in politics. This is not to say that women in organizations do not have influence. They do, but probably only or mainly within their organizations. The influence of women in their organizations, however, does not carry over into other political arenas.

Of course, we might need to consider other possible factors in future research. Perhaps women's participation in political arenas is more likely if female organizations control important economic resources. Such resources may give women more leverage politically. Also, some types of female organizations may have more power than others; for example, stand-alone organizations may have more power than those that are connected to male organizations. But it is also possible that adding these additional conditions would not change the basic finding-separate female organizations (perhaps because they are separate) do not have any impact on women's participation in other political arenas.

Recently, people in the United States have started to discuss a related issue—the possible effects of female "separateness" on

**STACK** 

eties continue to be an important part of social life because many men and women have engaged in military activity on behalf of the United States in World Wars I and II, in Korea and Vietnam, and in Desert Storm. Returning soldiers are welcomed with traditional songs of honor and victory dances.<sup>15</sup>

#### **Regional Associations**

Regional associations are clubs that bring together migrants from a common geographical background. Thus, they are often found in urban centers, which traditionally have attracted settlers from rural areas. In the United States, for example, migrants from rural Appalachia have formed associations in Chicago and Detroit. Many of these organizations have become vocal political forces in municipal government. Regional associations often form even when migrants have come from a considerable distance. For example, in the Chinatowns of the United States and Canada, there were many associations

women's success. For example, do separate math and science classes for women lead to more equality between women and men in academic performance, in obtaining advanced degrees in math and science, and in access to high-paying positions in those areas? It is well known that women are very underrepresented in the math and physical science professions in the United States. For example, only 11 percent of persons who hold doctorates in physics and 16 percent in computer science are women; but in the social sciences and humanities the numbers of men and women are approximately equal.

These differences could be mostly a result of social conditions that discourage females in various subjects and professions. Researchers have found that teachers of math and science pay more attention to boys. When boys give wrong answers, teachers are apt to challenge them; when girls give wrong answers, teachers tend to express sympathy. Boys are more likely to operate scientific equipment; girls are more likely to take notes. In the

seventh grade, girls perform similarly to boys in math and science, but girls display less confidence in their abilities. By the time they graduate from high school, women have taken fewer math and science courses, so they are at a disadvantage for continuing in those fields.

If the dampening effects on women are social, or mostly social, what can be done? Because current research suggests that girls do best in learning science and math without boys, some researchers have advocated separate math and science activities (classes and clubs). So, for example, voluntary girls' clubs (Operation SMART) have been set up in 240 locations to interest elementary and junior high school girls in science. A majority of the girls from those schools voluntarily attend. Moreover, many of them now say they want to go into science. Whether they stay in science, or how well they do if they stay, is not clear yet. But if these programs work, we would have to conclude that "separate" is more equal than "together."

The two situations we have

described here do not seem to be parallel in their effects on women's status. Separate women's associations do not make (by themselves) for equality between the genders in political participation. But separate training for girls in math and science may make for more equality. What is different about the two situations? At least one thing is different. Separate women's associations are usually nonvoluntary; women more or less have to join because that's how the society structures what women can do. Separate training for females in math and science is usually voluntary; girls may opt for the separateness in order to acquire the skills and the confidence they need to move into arenas open to both genders. In other words, when achievement and not gender defines how far you can go, temporary separateness for women might increase the likelihood of gender equality in professions that do not have it now.

William Mangin described the role of regional associations in helping rural migrants adapt to urban life in Lima, Peru.<sup>17</sup> During the 1950s, Mangin studied a group of migrants from the rural mountains, the serranos from Ancash. Typically these serranos, about 120,000 in number, lived in a slumlike urban settlement called a *barriada*. The *barriada* was not officially recognized by either the national government or the city authorities. Accordingly, it lacked all normal city services, such as water supply, garbage removal, and police protection. Its inhabitants had left their rural birthplaces for reasons typical of such population movements, wherever they occur. These reasons were social and economic; most were related to population and land pressure, but the higher expectations associated with the

#### WHY DO STREET GANGS DEVELOP, AND WHY ARE THEY VIOLENT?

The street gangs of young people that we read and hear about so often are voluntary associations. They are a little like agesets in that the members are all about the same age, but they are unlike age-sets in being voluntary and they do not "graduate" through life stages together. Nobody has to join, although there may be strong social pressure to join the neighborhood gang. Gangs have a clear set of values, goals, roles, group functions, symbols, and initiations. Street gangs are also often like military associations in their commitment to violence in the defense of gang interests.

Violent street gangs are found in many U.S. cities, particularly in poor neighborhoods. But poverty alone does not appear sufficient to explain the existence of gangs. For example, there was plenty of poverty in Mexico, but gangs did not develop there. In Mexico there was a palomilla (age-cohort) tradition; age-mates hung out together and continued their friendship well into adulthood, but there were no gangs as we know them. Mexican American gangs did develop in the barrios of cities such as Los Angeles. When we realize that *most* youths in poor neighborhoods do not join gangs, it is clear that poor neighborhoods cannot explain gangs. (It is estimated that only 3 to 10 percent of Mexican American young people join gangs.)

But why do some young people join and not others? If we look at who joins a gang, it seems to be those children who are subject to the most domestic stress. The gang "joiners" are likely to come from poor families, have several siblings, and have no father in the household. They seem to have had difficulty in school and have gotten into trouble early. What about gangs appeals to them? Most adolescents in this country have a difficult time deciding who they are and what kind of person they want to be, but young people who join gangs seem to have more identity problems. One eighteen-yearold said he "joined the gang for my ego to go higher," reflecting a low self-esteem. Those who are raised in female-centered households seem to be looking for a way to show how "masculine" they are. They look up to the tough male street gang members

big city-better education, social mobility, wage labor—were also compelling considerations.

Typically also, the serranos from Ancash formed a regional association. Club membership was open to both sexes. Men generally controlled the executive positions, and club leaders were often men who achieved political power in their hometowns. Women, who had relatively less economic and social freedom, nevertheless played an important part in club activities.

The serrano regional association performed three main services for its members. First, it lobbied the central government on matters of community importance—for example, the supplying of sewers, clinics, and similar public services. A club member had to follow a piece of legislation through the channels of government to make certain it was not

forgotten or abandoned. Second, the serrano association assisted in acculturating newly arrived serranos to the urban life in Lima. The most noticeable rural traits-coca chewing, and hairstyle and clothing peculiarities—were the first to disappear, with the men generally able to adapt faster than the women. The association also provided opportunities for fuller contact with the national culture. And finally, the group organized social activities such as fiestas, acted as the clearinghouse for information transmitted to and from the home area, and supplied a range of other services to help migrants adapt to their new environment while retaining ties to their birthplace.

The functions of regional associations may change over time as social conditions change. For example, during the plantation period in Hawaii, many

and want to act like them. But getting into a gang requires initiation. Most gangs have their own stylized rituals; for example, Mexican American gangs physically beat the initiate, who must show bravery and courage. As happens in most initiation ceremonies, the gang initiate identifies even more strongly with the group afterward. So, belonging to a gang may make some youths feel as if they belong to something important. This is a kind of psychological adjustment, but is it adaptive? Does being in a gang help such youths survive in a neighborhood where young men are often killed? Or are gang members less likely to survive? We really don't know the answers to those questions.

Why did gangs develop in the United States and not in Mexico? Were there some things different about life for Mexican Americans in the cities of the United States? Life in the United States was more difficult in several respects. First, many Mexican immigrants had to settle for very low pay and housing in marginal areas of the city. Second, they were subject to a lot of social and job discrimination. Third, they were immersed in a new culture that differed in many ways from their own. The young people who were least able to cope with these stresses were probably most likely to join gangs. But what explains the culture of violence of these gangs? Some scholars have suggested that the need to show exaggerated "masculine" behavior is a response to the absence of male models in the household. The association of many young men who have this same need may explain the violence of gangs. If aggressiveness is part of the

male role (for example, until recently only males were allowed to engage in military combat), then a young man who wants to exhibit his masculinity may be extremely aggressive.

We need much more research to uncover why gangs develop more often in some societies than in others, and why they often are violent. Are there places where aggressiveness is not so much part of the male role, and are they therefore less likely to have violent gangs?

Filipino migrants joined hometown associations that served as mutual aid societies. As more and more Filipinos went to Hawaii, however, more people had kin to whom they could turn. The hometown associations continue to have some economic functions, such as assistance in times of emergency, serious illness, or death, and some scholarship aid, but meetings are infrequent and most members do not attend. Those members who are active seem to want the recognition and prestige that can be attained through leadership positions in the hometown association, which is much more than they can achieve in the wider Hawaiian arena.<sup>18</sup>

Although regional clubs may help to integrate their members into a more complex urban or changing environment, the presence of many such groups may increase divisiveness and rivalry among groups. In some areas the smaller groups have banded together and become quite powerful. For example, within each Chinatown of a major U.S. or Canadian city, the various regional and family associations formed a Chinese Benevolent Association. This larger association, usually controlled by the wealthiest Chinese merchants, acted to oversee business, settle disputes, and to organize against discrimination from the outside.<sup>19</sup> Thus, by banding together, the regional and family associations formed ethnic associations.

#### Ethnic Associations

There are many types of ethnic associations or interest groups, and they are found in cities all over the world. Membership in these associations is based

![](_page_12_Picture_0.jpeg)

In most major cities with Chinatown, as in San Francisco, many regional and family associations merged together to form larger associations, like Hop Sing Tong, a fraternal organization established in 1870 that acted to oversee business, settle disputes, and fight against discrimination.

on ethnicity. Ethnic associations are particularly widespread in urban centers of West Africa. There, accelerated cultural change-reflected in altered economic arrangements, in technological advances, and in new urban living conditions-has weakened kinship relations and other traditional sources of support and solidarity.<sup>20</sup> Sometimes it is difficult to say whether a particular association is ethnic or regional in origin; it may be both.

Tribal unions are frequently found in Nigeria and Ghana. These are typical of most such associations in that they are extraterritorial (that is, they recruit members who have left their tribal locations), they have a formal constitution, and they have been formed to meet certain needs arising out of conditions of urban life. One such need is to keep members in touch with their traditional culture. The Ibo State Union, for example, in addition to providing mutual aid and financial support in case of unemployment, sickness, or death, performs the service "of fostering and keeping alive an interest in tribal song, history, language and moral beliefs and thus maintaining a person's attachment to his native town or village."<sup>21</sup> Some tribal unions collect money to improve conditions in their ancestral homes. Education, for example, is an area of particular concern. Others publish newsletters that report members' activities. Most unions have a young membership that exercises a powerful democratizing influence in tribal councils, and the organizations provide a springboard for those with national political aspirations.

Friendly societies differ from tribal unions in that their objectives are confined for the most part to mutual aid. Such a club was formed by the wives of Kru migrants in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Kru men normally go to sea-still a hazardous occupation. The club is classified into three grades. An admission fee permits entry into the lowest grade. Elevation to higher grades depends on further donations. At the death of a member or her husband, the family receives a lump sum commensurate with her status in the club. The Yoruba Friendly Society in Nigeria uses another approach to mutual aid. At regular intervals all members contribute a fixed sum, and the total is given to one member at a time. In this way, significant amounts of capital are available, in rotation, for each member to buy trading stock, to purchase expensive new clothes (to keep up appearances in a government post, for example), or even to pay a bride price. Rotating credit associations, such as the Yoruba Friendly Society, are found throughout Nigeria and in other countries of sub-Saharan Africa, and in Southeast Asia as well.

West African occupational clubs also fall into the ethnic category. They are African versions of trade unions, organized along tribal as well as craft lines. Their principal concern is the status and remuneration of their members as workers. The Motor Drivers' Union of Keta, in Ghana, was formed to fund insurance and legal costs, to contribute to medical care in case of accident or illness, and to help pay for funeral expenses.

Finally, clubs that concentrate on entertainment and recreation are very common in West Africa. The dancing compin of Sierra Leone is typical. Kenneth Little described it as

> a group of young men and women concerned with the performance of "plays" of traditional music and dancing and with the raising of money for mutual benefit. . . . A "play" is generally given in connection with some important event . . . or as part of the ceremonies celebrating a wedding or a funeral. The general public as well as the persons honored by the performance are expected to donate money to the compin on these occasions. Money is also collected in the form of weekly subscriptions from the members.<sup>22</sup>

Some observers have suggested that the widespread incidence of ethnic associations in West Africa has virtually amounted to a resurgence of tribalism. The presence of such interest groups in urban areas has indeed seemed to slow the development of national identity and loyalty. On the other hand, the evidence indicates that these clubs serve important adaptive and integrative functions for both men and women, just as regional associations do in other areas of the world. As Little stated, "Their combination of modern and traditional

traits constitutes a cultural bridge which conveys, metaphorically speaking, the tribal individual from one kind of sociological universe to another."23

#### **Multi-Ethnic Associations**

Although many voluntary associations draw on people from the same regional or ethnic background, increasingly in the modern world voluntary groups draw members from many different backgrounds. For example, the Kafaina, or Wok Meri ("women's work"), associations in Papua New Guinea are savings and loan associations that link thousands of women from different tribal areas.<sup>24</sup> Originally, there were smaller groups that started as savings associations in particular localities, but links between groups developed as women who married out of a village encouraged a relative back home or in another village to start a "daughter" group. "Mother-daughter" visits between groups can last for three days as one group hosts another and the groups exchange money. All money received from another group is placed in a netbag that is hidden and cannot be touched, so the savings grow over time. When a group accumulates a certain amount, a building the size of a men's house is built for the association and a very large ceremony is held. Does the development of these women's associations translate into new power for women in their traditionally male-dominated societies? That has yet to happen (see the box titled "Do Separate Women's Associations Increase Women's Status and Power?"). Apparently frustrated by their exclusion from local politics, the women are increasingly participating in the Kafaina movement. They may have intergroup exchanges and they may now engage in public speaking, but so far their arena is still separate from the men's arena.

Just as the Kafaina women's associations seem to be a response to perceived deprivation, the formation of associations with multi-ethnic or regional membership is not unusual where colonialism or other political domination is recognized as a common problem. For example, in Alaska in the 1960s Native Americans felt threatened by proposals for economic development that they thought would threaten their subsistence resources. Many regional and ethnic associations formed during this crisis, but perhaps more significant (from the point of view of achieving substantial compensation and titles to land) was the formation of a pan-Alaska association called the Alaska Federation of Natives. What made the amalgamation possible? Like the leaders of multi-ethnic movements in many places,

the leaders at the highest levels seem to have had a lot of things in common. They were educated, urban dwellers who worked at professional occupations. Perhaps most important, many of them had attended the same schools.<sup>25</sup>

Multi-ethnic and multiregional associations have often been involved in independence movements all over the world. Often, revolutionary political parties develop out of such associations and lead the efforts to gain independence. Why independence movements develop in some places but not in others is not yet understood.

#### Other Interest Groups

Societies such as the United States consist of people from many different ethnic backgrounds. Often there are voluntary ethnic and regional associations. But the majority of the voluntary associations in our own and other complex societies have members who belong because of common, achieved interests. These common interests include occupation (so we have trade unions and professional associations), political affiliation (as in national political parties and political action groups), recreation (such as sports and game clubs, fan clubs, music and theater groups), charities, and social clubs. The larger and more diversified the society, the more different kinds of associations there are. They bring together sets of people with common interests, aspirations, or qualifications, and they provide opportunities to work for social causes, for self-improvement, or to satisfy a need for new and stimulating experiences. We join clubs and other interest groups because we want to achieve particular goals. Not the least of such goals is identification with a "corporate" group and through it the acquisition of status and influence.

Joining clubs is much more important in some societies than in others. Norway is an example of a society with a rich organizational life. Even in areas with small communities there are many different clubs. For example, Douglas Caulkins found that in the municipality of Volda, a town of about 7,000, there were 197 organizations. People were expected to be active in at least a couple of organizations, and these groups met regularly. In fact, there were so many meetings that organizations were expected to coordinate their calendars so that the meetings would not interfere with one another.<sup>26</sup> Why some societies, like Norway, have so much involvement with voluntary associations is not well understood. Nor do we understand what the consequences of such involvement may be. Norway happens to have a particularly low rate of crime and it scores high on other indicators of social and economic health.<sup>27</sup> Does the complexity of its organizational life, and its many overlapping involvements, play a role in its social health? We don't yet know, because cross-cultural studies to test that possibility have not yet been done.

## EXPLAINING VARIATION IN ASSOCIATIONS

Anthropologists are not content to provide descriptions of the structure and operation of human associations. They also seek to understand why different types of associations develop. For example, what may account for the development of age-set systems?

S. N. Eisenstadt's comparative study of African age-sets led him to the hypothesis that when kinship groups fail to carry out functions important to the integration of society-such as political, educational, and economic functions-age-set systems arise to fill the void. Age-set systems may provide a workable solution to a society's need for functional divisions among its members, because age is a criterion that can be applied to all members of society in the allocation of roles.<sup>28</sup> But it is not at all clear why age-set systems arise to fill the void left by lack of kinship organization. Many societies have kin structures that are limited in scope, yet the majority of them have not adopted an age-set system.

B. Bernardi, in his critical evaluation of Nilo-Hamitic age-set systems,<sup>29</sup> also suggested that ageset systems arise to make up for a deficiency in social organization. But, in contrast with Eisenstadt, Bernardi specifically suggested why more social organization is necessary and what particular deficiencies in the previous form of organization should favor development of age-sets. He hypothesized that age-set systems arise in societies that have a history of territorial rivalry, lack central authority, and have only dispersed kin groups. When all three factors are present, he argued, the need for a mechanism of territorial integration is supplied by an age-set system.

One cross-cultural study suggests that territorial rivalry, as indicated by warfare, may favor the development of age-set systems, but this study found no evidence to support Bernardi's hypothesis that age-sets develop in societies that lack central authority and have only dispersed kin groups.<sup>30</sup> So it does not seem that age-set societies are deficient in political or kinship organization. An alternative explanation, which is consistent with the crosscultural evidence, is that age-set systems arise in societies that have both frequent warfare and local groups that change in size and composition throughout the year. In such situations, men may not always be able to rely on their kinsmen for cooperation in warfare because the kinsmen are not always nearby. Age-sets, however, can provide allies wherever one happens to be.<sup>31</sup> This interpretation suggests that age-set systems arise in addition to, rather than as alternatives to, kin-based and politically based forms of integration.<sup>32</sup>

As for voluntary associations whose membership is variably ascribed (that is, determined at birth but not found in all persons of a given age-sex category), it is difficult to say exactly what causes them to arise. As already noted, there are suggestions that voluntary associations of all types become more numerous (and more important) as the society harboring them advances in technology, complexity, and scale. No definitive evidence is yet available to support this explanation, but the following trends seem to be sufficiently established to merit consideration.

First, there is urbanization. Developing societies are becoming urban, and as their cities grow, so does the number of people separated from their traditional kinship ties and local customs. It is not surprising, then, that the early voluntary associations should be mutual-aid societies, established first to take over kin obligations in case of death, and later broadening their benefits in other directions. In this respect, the recent associations of the developing African societies closely resemble the early English laboring-class associations. Those clubs also served to maintain the city migrant's contacts with former traditions and culture. The regional associations in Latin America resemble the regional associations of European immigrants in the United States. Such associations also seem to arise in response to the migrant's or immigrant's needs in the new home.

Second, there is an economic factor. Migrants and immigrants try to adapt to new economic conditions, and group interests in the new situations have to be organized, promoted, and protected.

Why, then, do variably ascribed associations tend to be replaced by clubs of the achieved category in highly industrialized societies? Perhaps the strong focus on specialization in industrialized societies is reflected in the formation of specialized groups. Possibly the emphasis on achievement in industrialized societies is another contributing factor. Perhaps, too, the trend toward uniformity, encouraged by mass marketing and the mass media, is progressively weakening the importance of regional and ethnic distinctions. The result seems to be that the more broadly based organizations are being replaced by more narrowly based associations that are more responsive to particular needs not being met by the institutions of mass society.

## V SUMMARY

1. Associations or interest groups have the following characteristics in common: (a) some kind of formal, institutional structure exists; (b) some people are excluded from membership; (c) membership is based on commonly shared interests or purposes; and (d) there is a clearly discernible sense of mutual pride and belonging. Membership varies according to whether it is voluntary or not and according to whether the qualities of members are universally ascribed, variably ascribed, or achieved.

2. Age-sets are nonvoluntary associations whose members belong because of universally ascribed characteristics. They are composed of groups of persons of similar age and sex who move through life's stages together. Entry into the system is usually by an initiation ceremony. Transitions to new stages are usually marked by succession rituals. Unisex associations restrict membership to one sex. In noncommercial societies membership in such associations (usually male) is generally nonvoluntary.

3. Regional and ethnic organizations are voluntary associations whose members belong because of variably ascribed characteristics. Both usually occur in societies where technological advance is accelerating, bringing with it economic and social complexity. Despite a variety of types, regional and ethnic associations have in common an emphasis on (a) helping members adapt to new conditions; (b) keeping members in touch with home-area traditions; and (c) promoting improved living conditions for members who have recently migrated to urban areas.

4. Associations whose members belong because of variably ascribed characteristics tend to be replaced in highly industrialized societies by associations whose membership is based on achieved qualities.
