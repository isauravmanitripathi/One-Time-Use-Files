# Explanation and Evidence

![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg)

An important part of any discipline is description. A cultural anthropologist who goes to study a group of people tries to describe how the people live. How do they get food? How do they organize labor? How do they marry? The traditional goal of fieldwork is to arrive at accurate answers to such descriptive questions. But as important as accurate description is, it is not the ultimate goal of anthropology. Anthropologists want to understand-to know why people have certain traits or customs, not just that they do have them. As difficult as the how and what questions are to answer, the why questions are even harder. Why questions deal with explanations, which are harder to generate and harder to evaluate. In science, to understand is to explain, and so the major goal of science is to arrive at trustworthy explanations.<sup>1</sup>

This chapter is concerned largely with scientific understanding—what it means to explain and what kinds of evidence are needed to evaluate an explanation. We also discuss the various types of research that are conducted in cultural anthropology, from ethnography and ethnohistory to cross-cultural comparisons.

## EXPLANATIONS

An **explanation** is an answer to a why question. But there are many types of explanation, some more satisfying than others. For example, suppose we ask why a society has a long postpartum sex taboo.

This chapter deals largely with the scientific view of understanding, but there are anthropologists who question whether the scientific approach is desirable or possible. They often describe themselves as humanists who use the human capacity to intuit, empathize, evoke, interpret, and illuminate as ways to understand. This orientation offers a very different kind of understanding because compared with that offered by science it does not insist on objectivity, nor does it insist on putting insights to empirical test as science does. This is not to say that scientists do not intuit or interpret—they often do in the process of deriving theories, which involves creative leaps of imagination. And scientists, like anyone else, may empathize with the plight or problems of the people they study. But the crucial difference between the humanistic and scientific orientations lies in the end result; for humanists interpretation or evocation is the goal, for scientists the goal is testing interpretations to see if they may be wrong.

**Current Issues**

Is objectivity possible? Or, because we are humans observing other humans, can we only be subjective? Objectivity requires trying to get at the truth despite the observer's subjective desires or needs. Is that possible? Can any human be unbiased? In an absolute sense, no one can be completely free of bias. But science has ways to strive for objectivity; it does not need to assume that every human is completely unbiased. Remember that even when humans do physical science they are often the observers, or the creators of the instruments that do the observation. When an instrument points to a number, two humans may get slightly different readings because they look at the instrument from different angles. But neither person will be far off the mark, and the average of readings of two or more individuals will be very close to the "true" score. But do we see other people objectively? Undoubtedly, some things are harder to "see" than others. It is easier to know objectively that wives and husbands usually sit down to dinner together, harder to "see" how they feel about one another. Suppose you are in a society where you We could guess that the people in that society want to abstain from sex for a year or so after the birth of a baby. Is this an explanation? Yes, because it does suggest that people have a pur*pose* in practicing the custom; it therefore partly answers the why question. But such an explanation would not be very satisfying because it does not specify what the purpose of the custom might be. How about the idea that people have a long postpartum sex taboo because it is their tradition? Yes, that too is an explanation, but it is not satisfactory for a different reason. It is a tautology; that is, the thing to be explained (the taboo) is being explained by itself, by its prior existence. To explain something in terms of tradition is to say that people do it because they already do it, which is not very informative. What kinds of

explanations are more satisfactory, then? In science, there are two kinds of explanation that researchers try to achieve—associations and theories.

#### Associations

One way of explaining something (an observation, an action, a habit, a custom) is to say how it conforms to a general principle or relationship. So to explain why the water left out in the basin froze last night, we say that it was quite cold last night and that water freezes at 32° F. The statement that water solidifies (becomes ice) at 32° is a statement of a relationship or association between two variablesthings or quantities that vary. In this case, variation in the state of water (liquid versus solid) is related to variation in the temperature of the air (above versus

never see any obvious expression of affection between husbands and wives. At first, your own cultural bias might lead you to think that such couples don't care for each other much. Such an observation might indeed be biased (and not objective) if it turned out that couples privately expressed affection to each other but avoided public expressions. Or, it might be that couples communicated their affection for each other in ways you didn't notice. But that doesn't mean that you wouldn't be able to figure this out eventually. In trying to understand the meaning of female-male relationships, you might very well try to establish close, personal relationships with some families. You might then ask people to tell you stories to try to see how they portrayed relations between husband and

wife. In short, a humanistic approach might help you understand how couples "really" feel about each other. But a scientist might go through the same procedure too in order to come to a tentative understanding.

As this example illustrates, humanistic understanding and science are not really incompatible. Both the scientist and the humanist would agree on the need to convey what a culture is like (for example, with regard to how couples feel about each other). But the scientist would insist on more. First, you would try to verify, perhaps by systematic interviewing, how commonly a feeling is shared in the culture. Second, you would want to explain why this feeling is common in some cultures but not in others. Therefore, you would have to create a theory to

explain the variation. Then you would have to collect evidence to test the theory to see if it might be wrong.

If humans are always biased observers, how can humanists convey the meaning behind other cultures? Aren't humanists trying to get close to the "truth" too? The poet Marianne Moore wrote that poetry gives us "imaginary gardens with real toads in them." Can imagination, humanistic or scientific, be meaningful without at least some real toads?

below 32° F). The truth of the relationship is suggested by repeated observations. In the physical sciences, such relationships are called **laws** when they are accepted by almost all scientists. We find such explanations satisfactory because they allow us to predict what will happen in the future or to understand something that has happened regularly in the past. In the social sciences, associations are usually stated probabilistically: we say that two or more variables *tend* to be related in a predictable way, which means that there are usually some exceptions. For example, to explain why a society has a long postpartum sex taboo, we can point to the association (or correlation) that John Whiting found in a worldwide sample of societies: societies with apparently low-protein diets tend to have long postpartum sex taboos.<sup>2</sup> We call the relationship between low protein and the sex taboo a statistical associa**tion,** which means that the observed relationship is unlikely to be due to chance.

Even though laws and statistical associations explain by relating what is to be explained to other things, we want to know more—why those laws or associations exist. Why does water freeze at 32° F? Why do societies with low-protein diets tend to have long postpartum sex taboos? Therefore, scientists try to formulate theories that will explain the observed relationships (laws and statistical associations).<sup>3</sup>

#### Theories

**Theories**—explanations of laws and statistical associations-are more complicated than the observed relationships they are intended to explain. It is difficult to be precise about what a theory is. By way of example, let us return to the question of why some societies have long postpartum sex taboos. We have already seen that a known statistical association can be used to help explain it: in general (but not always), if a society has a low-protein diet, it will have a long postpartum sex taboo. But most people would ask additional questions. Why does a lowprotein diet explain the taboo? What is the mechanism by which a society with such a diet develops the custom of a long postpartum sex taboo? A theory is intended to answer such questions. In the chapter on the concept of culture, we briefly discussed John Whiting's theory that a long postpartum sex taboo may be an adaptation to certain conditions. Particularly in tropical areas, where the major food staples are low in protein, babies are vulnerable to the protein-deficiency disease called kwashiorkor. But if a baby could continue to nurse for a long time, it might have more of a chance to

survive. The postpartum sex taboo might be adaptive, Whiting's theory suggests, because it increases the likelihood of a baby's survival. That is, if a mother puts off having another baby for a while, the first baby might have a better chance to survive because it can be fed mother's milk for a longer time. Whiting suggests that parents may be unconsciously or consciously aware that having another baby too soon might jeopardize the survival of the first baby, and so they might decide that it would be a good idea to abstain from intercourse for more than a year after the birth of the first baby.

As this example of a theory illustrates, there are differences between a theory and an association. A theory is more complicated, containing a series of statements. An association usually states quite simply that there is a relationship between two or a few measured variables. Another difference is that, although a theory may mention some things that are observable (such as the presence of a long postpartum sex taboo), parts of it are difficult or impossible to observe directly. For example, with regard to Whiting's theory, it would be difficult to find out if people had deliberately or unconsciously decided to practice a long postpartum sex taboo because they recognized that babies would thereby have a better chance to survive. Then too, the concept of adaptation-that some characteristic promotes greater reproductive success—is difficult to verify because it is difficult to find out whether different individuals or groups have different rates of reproduction because they do or do not practice the supposedly adaptive custom. So, some concepts or implications in a theory are unobservable (at least at the present time) and only some aspects may be observable. In contrast, statistical associations or laws are based entirely on observations.<sup>4</sup>

# WHY THEORIES CANNOT BE PROVED

Many people think that the theories they learned in physics or chemistry classes have been proved. Unfortunately, many students get that impression because their teachers may present "lessons" in an authoritative manner. It is now generally agreed by scientists and philosophers of science that theories may have considerable evidence supporting them, but no theory can be said to be proved or unquestionably true. This is because many of the concepts and ideas in theories are not directly observable and therefore not directly verifiable. For example, scientists may try to explain how light behaves by postulating that it consists of particles called photons. But we cannot observe photons even with the most powerful microscope. So, exactly what a photon looks like and exactly how it works remain in the realm of the unprovable. The photon is a **theoreti**cal construct, something that cannot be observed or verified directly. Because all theories contain such ideas, theories cannot be proved entirely or with absolute certainty.<sup>5</sup>

Why should we bother with theories, then, if we cannot prove that they are true? Perhaps the main advantage of a theory as a kind of explanation is that it may lead to new understanding or knowledge. A theory can suggest new relationships or imply new predictions that might be supported or confirmed by new research. For example, Whiting's theory about long postpartum sex taboos has implications that could be investigated by researchers. Because the theory discusses how a long postpartum sex taboo might be adaptive, we would expect that certain changes will result in the taboo's disappearance. For example, suppose people adopted either mechanical birth-control devices or began to give supplementary high-protein foods to babies. With birth control, a family could space births without abstaining from sex, so we would expect the custom of postpartum abstinence to disappear. So too, we would expect it to disappear with protein supplements for babies, because kwashiorkor would then

An atom, like a photon, cannot be observed. But there are theories about atoms and what they look like. This traditional model of a beryllium atom is now thought to be somewhat inaccurate: the electrons are probably more eccentric in their orbits and further from the nucleus.

be less likely to afflict the babies. Whiting's ideas might also prompt investigators to try to find out whether parents are consciously or unconsciously aware of the problem of close birth spacing in areas with low supplies of protein.

Although theories cannot be proved, they are rejectable. The method of falsification (which shows that a theory seems to be wrong) is the main way that theories are judged.<sup>6</sup> Scientists derive implications or predictions that should be true if the theory is correct. So, for example, Whiting predicted from his theory that societies with long postpartum sex taboos would be found more often in the tropics than in temperate regions and that they would be likely to have low protein supplies. Such predictions of what might be found are called **hypotheses**. If the predictions turn out not to be correct, the researcher is obliged to conclude that there may be something wrong with the theory (or something wrong with the test of the theory). Theories that are not falsified are accepted for the time being because the available evidence seems to be consistent with them. But remember that no matter how much the available evidence seems to support a theory, we can never be certain it is true. There is always the possibility that some implication of it, some hypothesis derivable from it, will not be confirmed in the future.

# GENERATING THEORIES

In the previous chapter we discussed many of the theoretical orientations that have existed in cultural anthropology. Most of these orientations merely suggest where to look for answers to questions; they do not by themselves suggest particular explanations for particular phenomena. You cannot directly deduce a theory from a theoretical orientation. For example, an anthropologist with an ecological theoretical orientation is likely to say that some particular custom exists because it is or used to be adaptive. But exactly how a particular custom may be adaptive must still be specified; the mechanism of its adaptiveness is not automatically suggested by the theoretical orientation. Whiting's theory suggests specific conditions under which the long postpartum sex taboo might be adaptive. The theory does not just say that the taboo is adaptive. How, then, does an anthropologist develop an explanation or theory for some particular phenomenon?

It is difficult to specify any one procedure that is guaranteed to produce a theory, because developing a theory requires creative imagination, and no

discovery procedure by itself necessarily generates creativity. Too much dependence on a particular theoretical orientation may, in fact, be detrimental, because it may blind the investigator to other possibilities. A more important factor in generating a theory may be the investigator's belief that it is possible to do so. A person who believes that something is explainable will be more apt to notice possibly connected facts, as well as to recall possibly relevant considerations, and to put them all together in some explanatory way.

We can point to some procedures that have helped anthropologists produce explanations of cultural phenomena. These procedures seem to consist of two types; anthropologists may be helped by analysis of a particular society (we refer to this as single-case analysis), or they may try to come up with a theory by a *comparative study* of more than one society.

In analyzing a single case, the anthropologist may be interested in explaining a particular custom. While in the field, one may ask informants why they practice (or think they practice) the custom. Sometimes such inquiries will elicit a plausible explanation. But more often than not, the informants may merely answer, "We have always done it that way." The investigator may then make a kind of mental search through other features of the society or its environment that may be connected with the custom. If possible, the anthropologist may try to view the situation historically, to see if the custom appeared rather recently. If it did, what possible explanatory conditions appeared just before the custom?

An anthropologist may also generate an explanation by comparing different societies that share this characteristic, in order to determine what other characteristics regularly occur along with it. Societies in which the characteristic is lacking would also be considered, because a possible cause of that characteristic should be absent in those societies. If the anthropologist discovers that a characteristic occurs regularly in different cultures along with certain other features, we may be reasonably certain that the possible causes of that characteristic have been narrowed down.

It must be remembered, however, that the investigator is not a computer. It is not necessary to search through all the characteristics that might be shared by different cultures. The investigator usually looks only at those traits that can plausibly be connected. Here is where an individual's theoretical orientation generally comes into play, since that orientation usually points to the possible importance of one particular set of factors over others.

# EVIDENCE: TESTING EXPLANATIONS

In any field of investigation, theories are generally the most plentiful commodity, apparently because of the human predisposition to try to make sense of the world. It is necessary, then, for us to have procedures that enable us to select from among the many available theories those that are more likely to be correct. "Just as mutations arise naturally but are not all beneficial, so hypotheses [theories] emerge naturally but are not all correct. If progress is to occur, therefore, we require a superfluity of hypotheses and also a mechanism of selection."<sup>7</sup> In other words, generating a theory or interpretation is not enough. We need some reliable method of testing whether or not that interpretation is likely to be correct. If an interpretation is not correct, it may detract from our efforts to achieve understanding by misleading us into thinking the problem is already solved.

The strategy of all kinds of testing in science is to predict what one would expect to find if a particular interpretation were correct and then to conduct an investigation to see if the prediction is borne out. If the prediction is not borne out, the investigator is obliged to accept the possibility that the interpretation is wrong. If, however, the prediction holds true, then the investigator is entitled to say that there is evidence to support the theory. Thus, conducting research designed to test expectations derived from theory allows us to eliminate some interpretations and to accept others, at least tentatively.

## Operationalization and Measurement

We test predictions derived from a theory to see if the theory may be correct, to see if it is consistent with observable events or conditions in the real world. A theory and the predictions derived from it are not useful if there is no way to measure the events or conditions mentioned in the predictions. If there is no way of relating the theory to observable events, it does not matter how good the theory sounds—it is still not a useful scientific theory.<sup>8</sup> To transform theoretical predictions into statements that might be verified, a researcher provides an operational definition of each of the concepts or variables mentioned in the prediction. An operational definition is a description of the procedure that is followed to measure the variable.<sup>9</sup>

Whiting predicted that societies with a lowprotein diet would have a long postpartum sex

The Yanomamö Indians of Brazil depend mostly on root crops. The Masai pastoralists of Kenya depend largely on milk and other products of cattle.

taboo. Amount of protein in the diet is a variable; some societies have more, others have less. Length of the postpartum sex taboo is a variable; a society may have a short taboo or a long taboo. Whiting operationally defined the first variable, amount of protein, in terms of staple foods.<sup>10</sup> For example, if a society depended mostly on root and tree crops (such as cassava and bananas), Whiting rated the society as having low protein. If the society depended mostly on cereal crops (wheat, barley, corn, oats, and so on), he rated it as having moderate protein, because cereal crops have more protein by weight than root and tree crops. If the society depended mostly on hunting, fishing, or herding for food, he rated it as having high protein. The other variable in Whiting's prediction, length of postpartum sex taboo, was operationalized as follows: a society was rated as having a long taboo if couples customarily abstained from sex for more than a year after the birth of a baby; abstention for a year or less was considered a short taboo.

Specifying an operational definition for each variable is extremely important because it allows other investigators to check on a researcher's results.<sup>11</sup> Science depends on replication, or the repetition of results. Only when many researchers observe a particular association can we call that association or relationship a law. Providing operational definitions is extremely important also because it allows others to evaluate whether a measure is appropriate. Only when we are told exactly how something was measured can we judge whether the measure reflects what it is supposed to reflect. Specifying measures publically is so important in science that we are obliged to be skeptical of any conclusions offered by a researcher who fails to say how variables were measured.

To **measure** something is to say how it compares with other things on some scale of variation.<sup>12</sup> People often assume that a measuring device is always a physical instrument (such as a scale or a ruler), but physical devices are not necessary to measure something. Classification is also a form of measurement. When we classify persons as male or female, or employed versus unemployed, we are dividing them into sets. Deciding which set they belong to is a kind of measure because doing so allows us to compare them. We can also measure things by deciding which cases or examples have more or less of something (for instance, more or less protein in the diet). The measures employed in physical science are usually based on scales that allow us to assign numbers to each case: we may measure height in meters and weight in grams, for example. However we measure our variables, the fact that we can measure them means that we can test our hypotheses to see if the predicted relationships actually exist, at least most of the time.

## Sampling

After an investigator decides how to measure the variables in some predicted relationship, she or he must decide how to select which cases to investigate to see if the predicted relationship holds. If the prediction is about the behavior of people, the sampling decision involves which people to observe. If the prediction is about an association between societal customs, the sampling decision involves which societies should be studied. Investigators must decide not only which cases to choose but also how many to choose. No researcher can investigate all the possible cases, so choices must be made. Some choices are better than others. In the chapter on the concept of culture, we talked about the advantages of random sampling. A random sample is one in which all cases selected had an equal chance to be included in the sample. Almost all statistical tests used to evaluate the results of research require random sampling, because only results based on a random sample can be assumed to be probably true for some larger set or universe of cases.

Before a researcher can sample randomly, he or she must specify the **sampling universe**—that is, the list of cases to be sampled from. Suppose an anthropologist is doing fieldwork in a society. Unless the society is very small, it is usually not practical to use the whole society as the sampling universe. Because most fieldworkers want to remain in a community for a considerable length of time, the community usually becomes the sampling universe. If a cross-cultural researcher wants to test an explanation, she or he needs to sample the world's societies. But we do not have descriptions of all the societies, past and present, that have existed in the world. So samples are usually drawn from published lists of described societies that have been classified or coded according to standard cultural variables,<sup>13</sup> or they are drawn from the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF), an indexed, annually growing collection of original ethnographic books and articles on more than 350 societies past and present around the world.<sup>14</sup>

Random sampling is still not employed that often in anthropology, but a nonrandom sample might still be fairly representative if the investigator has not personally chosen the cases for study. We should be particularly suspicious of any sample that may reflect the investigator's own biases or interests. For example, if an investigator picks only the people with whom she or he is friendly, the sample is suspicious. If cross-cultural researchers select sample societies because ethnographies on them happen to be on their own bookshelves, such samples are also suspicious. A sampling procedure should be designed to get a fair representation of the sampling universe, not a biased selection. If we want to increase our chances of getting a representative sample, we have to use a random-sampling procedure. To do so, we conventionally number the cases in the statistical universe and then use a table of random numbers to draw our sample cases.

#### Statistical Evaluation

When the researcher has measured the variables of interest for all the sample cases, he or she is ready to see if the predicted relationship actually exists in the data. Remember, the results may not turn out to be what the theory predicts. Sometimes the researcher constructs a *contingency table*, like that shown in Table  $4-1$ , to see if the variables are associated as predicted. In Whiting's sample of 172 societies, each case is assigned to a box, or cell, in the table, depending on how the society is measured on the two variables of interest. For example, a society that has a long postpartum sex taboo and low protein is placed in the lowest right-hand cell of the Duration columns. (In Whiting's sample—see Table 4–1 there are 27 such societies.) A society that has a short postpartum sex taboo and low protein is placed in the lowest left-hand cell. (There are 20 such societies in the sample.) The statistical question is: Does the way the cases are distributed in the six cells of the table support Whiting's prediction? If we looked just at the table, we might not know what to say. Many cases appear to be in the expected places. For example, most of the high-protein cases, 47 of 62, have short taboos, and most of the lowprotein cases, 27 of 47, have long taboos. But there are also many exceptions (for example, 20 cases have low protein and a short taboo). So, although many cases appear to be in the expected places, there are also many exceptions. Do the exceptions invalidate the prediction? How many exceptions

would compel us to reject the hypothesis? Here is where we resort to statistical tests of significance.

Statisticians have devised various tests that tell us how "perfect" a result has to be for us to believe that there is probably an association between the variables of interest, that one variable generally predicts the other. Essentially, every statistical result is evaluated in the same objective way. We ask: What is the chance that this result is purely accidental, that there is really no association at all between the two variables? Although some of the mathematical ways of answering this question are rather complicated, the answer always involves a probability value (or p**value**)—the likelihood that the observed result or a stronger one could have occurred by chance. The statistical test used by Whiting gives a p-value of less than .01 ( $p < .01$ ) for the observed result. In other words, there is less than 1 chance out of 100 that the relationship observed is purely accidental. A p-value of less than .01 is a fairly low probability; most social scientists conventionally agree to call any result with a p-value of .05 or less (5 or fewer chances out of  $100$ ) a statistically significant or probably true result. When we describe relationships or associations in the rest of this book, we are almost always referring to results that have been found to be statistically significant.

But why should a probably true relationship have any exceptions? If a theory is really correct, shouldn't all the cases fit? There are many reasons why we cannot ever expect a perfect result. First, even if a theory is correct (for example, if a lowprotein diet really does favor the adoption of a long postpartum sex taboo), there may still be other causes that we have not investigated. Some of the societies could have a long taboo even though they have high protein. For example, societies that depend mostly on hunting for their food (and that would therefore be classified as having a highprotein diet) may have a problem carrying infants from one campsite to another and may practice a long postpartum sex taboo so that two infants will not have to be carried at the same time. Exceptions to the predicted relationship might also occur because of cultural lag.<sup>15</sup> Suppose that a society recently changed crops and is now no longer a low-protein society but still practices the taboo. This society would be an exception to the predicted relationship, but it might fit the theory if it stopped practicing the taboo in a few years. Measurement inaccuracy is another source of exceptions. Whiting's measure of protein, which is based on the major sources of food, is not a very precise measure of protein in the diet. It does not take into account the possibility that a "tree-crop" society might get a lot of protein from

fishing or raising pigs. So it might turn out that some supposedly low-protein societies have been misclassified, which may be one reason there are 20 cases in the lowest cell in the left-hand column of Table 4-1. Measurement error usually produces exceptions.

Significant statistical associations that are predictable from a theory offer tentative support for the theory. But much more is needed before we can be fairly confident about the theory. Replication is needed to confirm whether the predictions can be reproduced by other researchers using other samples. Other predictions should be derived from the theory to see if they too are supported. The theory should be pitted against alternative explanations to see which theory works better. We may have to combine theories if the alternative explanations also predict the relationship in question. The research process in science thus requires time and patience. Perhaps most important, it requires that researchers be humble. No matter how wonderful one's own theory seems, it is important to acknowledge that it may be wrong. If we don't acknowledge that possibility, we can't be motivated to test our theories. If we don't test our theories, we can never tell the difference between a better or worse theory, and we will be saddled forever with our present ignorance. In science, knowledge or understanding is explained variation. And so, if we want to understand more, we have to keep testing our beliefs against sets of objective evidence that could falsify our beliefs.

# TYPES OF RESEARCH IN CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY

Cultural anthropologists use several different methods to conduct research. Each has certain advantages and disadvantages in generating and testing explanations. The types of research in cultural anthropology can be classified according to two criteria. One is the spatial scope of the study (analysis of a single society, analysis of several societies in a region, or analysis of a worldwide sample of societies). The other criterion is the *temporal* scope of the study (historical versus nonhistorical). The combination of these criteria is shown in Table 4-2, which identifies each of the major types of research in cultural anthropology.

## Ethnography

Around the beginning of the twentieth century, anthropologists realized that if they were to produce anything of scientific value, they would have

to study their subject in depth. To describe cultures more accurately, they started to live among the people they were studying. They observed, and even took part in, the important events of those societies and carefully questioned the people about their native customs. This method is known as participant-observation. Participant-observation always involves fieldwork, which is first-hand

experience with the people you are studying, but fieldwork may also involve other methods, such as conducting a census or a survey.<sup>16</sup>

Fieldwork, the cornerstone of modern anthropology, is the means by which most anthropological information is obtained. Regardless of other methods that anthropologists may use, participantobservation, usually for a year or more, is regarded

Hardly any cultural anthropologist disputes the value of fieldwork in another culture, both for what it contributes to understanding others and for what it contributes to understanding yourself and your own culture. Probably it is the immersion that does it: living with other people (which we call participantobservation) allows you to see things you would not otherwise notice. At the same time, you cannot help but realize how the smallest habitual things you do, which you may have thought were just natural, are just wrong in your field site. At the beginning, there is culture shock because there is so much you don't comprehend. And, at the end, there is culture shock when you

return home: all of a sudden, many things in your own society now feel strange. Indeed, the experience is so profound that most cultural anthropologists feel that fieldwork provides them with the "deepest" kind of knowledge. Not just deep, but real.

**Current Issues** 

Although few people doubt the value of fieldwork, challenges have come about veracity. Consider the controversy over the fieldwork of Margaret Mead, who lived on a small island in American Samoa in the 1920s and wrote about the sexual freedom of adolescents in Coming of Age in Samoa. Derek Freeman, who worked in Western Samoa largely in the 1960s, wrote a scathing critique of Mead's fieldwork in his Margaret Mead and

Samoa: The Making and Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth. Essentially, Freeman said that Mead got most things wrong: for example, he stated that the Samoans are puritanical in their sexuality. If both did fieldwork, and fieldwork gives us real, deep knowledge, then they should both be right. But how can they be? Was one a good fieldworker and the other not? How can we know what is true?

Paul Shankman suggests that both might be partly right if we recognize several things. First, he points out that we can speak of sexual permissiveness and sexual restrictiveness only in comparative terms. We need to understand that Mead did her fieldwork at a time when preas fundamental. In contrast to the casual descriptions of travelers and adventurers, anthropologists' descriptions must record, describe, analyze, and eventually formulate a picture of the culture, or at least part of it.<sup>17</sup> After doing fieldwork, an anthropologist may prepare an *ethnography*—a description and analysis of a single society.

How one goes about doing long-term participant-observation in another culture, and more important, doing it well, is not so straightforward. Much of it depends on the person, the culture, and the interaction between the two. Without doubt, the experience is physically and psychologically demanding, comparable often to a rite of passage. Although it helps enormously to learn the local language before one goes, it is often not possible to do so, and so most anthropologists find themselves struggling to communicate in addition to trying to figure out how to behave properly. Participantobservation itself carries its own dilemma. For participating implies living like the people you have come to study, trying to subjectively understand what they think and feel by doing what they do, whereas observation implies a certain amount of objectivity and detachment.<sup>18</sup> Because participantobservation is such a personal experience, it is not surprising that anthropologists have begun to realize that reflecting on their experiences and their personal interaction with the people they live with is an important part of understanding the enterprise.

An essential part of participant-observation process is taking notes, jotting down things observed, questions you asked and answers obtained, and things to check out later. Often these notes cannot be extensive or may not be legible later, so it is important to set aside time each day to go over and elaborate on your information, and classify it somehow, so you can find it later.<sup>19</sup>

marital sex was uncommon in the United States (sex patterns changed subsequently). So, in contrast with American girls during Mead's time, Samoan girls may have seemed more sexually free. Second, Samoa changed a great deal over time with missionization, colonialization, World War II, and commercialization. And, third, Samoa was variable—American Samoa versus Western Samoa, rural versus urban. So, what the two fieldworkers experienced may have been quite different, and therefore they could both be right. But in fact, Shankman suggests that if we ignore Mead's and Freeman's conclusions about permissive or restrictive sexuality, if we separate *ideal* from actual behavior, and if we look at actual data on individual

sexual behavior as collected by both Mead and Freeman, the two fieldworkers are not all that different-Samoans are in the middle of the worldwide range of cultures in regard to the occurrence of premarital sex.

What do we conclude from this controversy? As many anthropologists are now pointing out, it is important to reflect on the possible influences of the context of the fieldwork, the qualities of the person doing it, how that person interacts with the people she or he lives with, and the kinds of methods used to try to verify conclusions. Others point out that reflection, although important, is not enough. If we want to be more sure that we are understanding correctly, it is not sufficient to assume that the

traditional style of fieldwork (participant-observation and interviewing of a few selected informants) can always discover the truth in a field situation. Particularly for those behaviors that are private, or more variable, or not easily verbalized, anthropological fieldworkers should consider interviewing a representative sample of people and using tests of informant accuracy.

Participant-observation is quite valuable for understanding some aspects of culture, particularly the things that are the most public, readily talked about, and most widely agreed upon. But more systematic methods are important too: mapping, house-to-house censuses, behavior observations (for example, to determine how people spend their time), as well as focused interviews with a sample of informants.

Ethnographies and ethnographic articles on particular topics provide much of the essential data for all kinds of studies in cultural anthropology. To make a comparison of societies in a given region, or worldwide, an anthropologist would require ethnographic data on many societies.

With regard to the goal of generating theory, ethnography, with its in-depth, firsthand, long-term observation, provides an investigator with a wealth of descriptive material covering a wide range of phenomena. Thus, it may stimulate interpretations about the way different aspects of the culture are related to each other and to features of the environment. The ethnographer in the field has the opportunity to get to know the context of a society's customs by directly asking the people about those customs and by observing the phenomena that appear to be associated with those practices. In addition, the ethnographer who develops a possible explanation for some custom can test that hunch by collecting new information related to it. In this sense, the ethnographer is similar to a physician who is trying to understand why a patient has certain symptoms of illness.

Although ethnography is extremely useful for generating explanations, a field study of a single site does not generally provide sufficient data to test a hypothesis. For example, an ethnographer may think that a particular society practices polygyny (one man married to two or more women simultaneously) because it has more women than men. But the ethnographer could not be reasonably sure that this explanation was correct unless the results of a comparative study of a sample of societies showed that most polygynous societies have more women than men. After all, the fact that one society has both these conditions could be a historical accident rather than a result of some necessary connection between the two conditions.

## Within-Culture Comparisons

An ethnographer could test a theory within one society if she or he decides to compare individuals, families, households, communities, or districts.

The natural variability that exists can be used to create a comparison. Suppose we want to verify Whiting's assumption that in a society with lowprotein diets, longer postpartum taboos enhance the survival of babies. Although almost all couples might practice a long postpartum sex taboo because it was customary, some couples might not adhere to the taboo consistently and some couples might not conceive quickly after the taboo was lifted. So we would expect some variation in spacing between births. If we collected information on the births of each mother and the survival outcome of each birth, we would be able to compare the survival rates of children born a short time after the mother's last pregnancy with those of children born after longer intervals. A significantly higher survival rate for the births after longer intervals would support Whiting's theory. What if some communities within the society had access to more protein than others? If Whiting's theory is correct, those communities with more protein should also have a higher survival rate for babies. If there were variation in the length of the postpartum sex taboo, the communities with more protein should have shorter taboos.

Whether or not we can design intracultural tests of hypotheses depends on whether we have sufficient variability in the variables of our hypothesis. More often than not we do, and we can make use of that variation to test hypotheses within a culture.

## Nonhistorical Controlled Comparison

In a nonhistorical controlled comparison, the anthropologist compares ethnographic information obtained from societies found in a particular region—societies that presumably have similar histories and occupy similar environments. The anthropologist who conducts a regional comparison is apt to be familiar with the complex of cultural features associated with that region. These features may provide a good understanding of the context of the phenomenon that is to be explained. An anthropologist's knowledge of the region under study, however, is probably not as great as the ethnographer's knowledge of a single society. Still, the anthropologist's understanding of local details is greater in a regional comparison than in a worldwide comparison. The worldwide comparison is necessarily so broad that the investigator is unlikely to know a great deal about any of the societies being compared.

The regional controlled comparison is useful not only for generating explanations but also for testing them. Because some of the societies being compared will have the characteristic that is to be explained and some will not, the anthropologist can determine whether the conditions hypothesized to be related are in fact related, at least in that region. We must remember, however, that two or more conditions may be related in one region for reasons peculiar to that region. Therefore, an explanation supported in one region may not pertain in others.

#### Cross-Cultural Research

Anthropologists can generate interpretations on the basis of worldwide comparisons by looking for differences between those societies having, and those lacking, a particular characteristic. But the most common use of worldwide comparisons has probably been to test explanations. The cross-cultural researcher first identifies conditions that should generally be associated if a particular theory is correct. Then she or he looks at a worldwide sample of societies to see if the expected association generally holds true. The advantage of cross-cultural research is that the conclusion drawn from it is probably applicable to most societies, if the sample used for testing has been more or less randomly selected. In other words, in contrast with the results of a regional comparison, which may or may not be applicable to other regions, the results of a cross-

cultural study are presumably applicable to most societies and most regions.

As we have noted, the greater the number of societies examined in a study, the less likely it is that the investigator will have detailed knowledge of the societies involved. So if a cross-cultural test does not support a particular explanation, the investigator may not know enough about the sample societies to know how to modify the interpretation or come up with a new one. In this situation, the anthropologist may reexamine the details of one or more particular societies in order to stimulate fresh thinking on the subject. Another limitation of cross-cultural research, as a means both of generating and of testing explanations, is that only those explanations for which the required information is generally available in ethnographies can be tested. An investigator interested in explaining something that has not been generally described must resort to some other research strategy to collect data.

## Historical Research

Ethnohistory is the study of descriptive materials about a single society at more than one point in time. It provides the essential data for historical studies of all types, just as ethnography provides the essential data for all nonhistorical types of research. Ethnohistorical data may consist of sources other than the ethnographic reports prepared by anthropologists-accounts by explorers, missionaries, traders, and government officials. Ethnohistorians, like historians, cannot simply assume that all the documents used are simply descriptions of fact; they were written by very different kinds of people with very different goals and purposes. So it is necessary to separate what may be fact from what may be speculative interpretation. In terms of generating and testing hypotheses, studies of single societies over time tend to be subject to the same limitations as studies of single societies confined to a single period. Like their nonhistorical counterparts, studies that concentrate on a single society observed through time are likely to generate more than one hypothesis, but they do not generally provide the opportunity to establish with reasonable certainty which of those hypotheses is correct. Cross-cultural historical studies (of which we have only a few examples thus far) suffer from the opposite limitation. They provide ample means of testing hypotheses through comparison, but they are severely constrained (because of the necessity of working with secondhand data) in their ability to generate hypotheses derived from the available data.

There is, however, one advantage to historical studies of any type. The goal of theory in cultural anthropology is to explain variation in cultural patterns: that is, to specify what conditions will favor one cultural pattern rather than another. Such specification requires us to assume that the supposed causal, or favoring, conditions antedated the pattern to be explained. Theories or explanations, then, imply a *sequence* of changes over time, which are the stuff of history. Therefore, if we want to come closer to an understanding of the reasons for the cultural variations we are investigating, we should examine historical sequences. These will help us determine whether the conditions we think caused various phenomena truly antedated those phenomena and thus might more reliably be said to have caused them. If we can examine historical sequences, we may be able to make sure that we do not put the cart before the horse.

The major impediment to historical research is that collecting and analyzing historical dataparticularly when they come from the scattered accounts of explorers, missionaries, and traders—is a tedious and exasperating task. It may be more efficient to test explanations nonhistorically first, in order to eliminate some interpretations. Only when an interpretation survives a nonhistorical test should we look to historical data to test the presumed sequence.

In the chapters that follow, we discuss not only what we strongly suspect about the determinants of cultural variation but also what we do not know or only dimly suspect. We devote a lot of our discussion to what we do not know-what has not yet been the subject of research that tests hypotheses and theories—because we want to convey a sense of what cultural anthropology might learn in the future.

# ▼ SUMMARY

1. As important as accurate description is, it is not the ultimate goal of anthropology. Anthropologists want to understand—to know *why* people have certain traits or customs, not just that they do have them.

2. In science, to understand is to explain. Scientists try to achieve two kinds of explanation-associations (observed relationships between two or more variables) and theories (explanations of associations).

3. A theory is more complicated than an association. Some concepts or implications in a theory are unobservable; an association is based entirely on observations.

Theories can never be proved with ab-4. solute certainty. There is always the possibility that some implication, some derivable hypothesis, will not be confirmed by future research.

5. A theory is rejectable through the method of falsification. Scientists derive predictions that should be true if the theory is correct. If the predictions turn out to be incorrect, scientists are obliged to conclude that there may be something wrong with the theory.

To make a satisfactory test, we have to 6. specify operationally how we measure the variables involved in the relationships we expect to exist, so that other researchers can try to replicate, or repeat, our results.

7. Tests of predictions should employ samples that are representative. The most objective way to obtain a representative sample is to select the sample cases randomly.

8. The results of tests are evaluated by statistical methods that assign probability values to the results. These values allow us to distinguish between probably true and probably accidental results.

9. Cultural anthropologists use several different methods to conduct research. Each has certain advantages and disadvantages in generating and testing explanations. The types of research in cultural anthropology can be classified according to two criteria: the spatial scope of the study (analysis of a single society, analysis of several or more societies in a region, or analysis of a worldwide sample of societies) and the temporal scope of the study (historical versus nonhistorical). The basic research methods, then, are ethnography and ethnohistory, historical and nonhistorical controlled comparisons, and historical and nonhistorical cross-cultural research.
