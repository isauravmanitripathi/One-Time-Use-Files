# The Arts

![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg)

Most societies do not have a word for art.<sup>1</sup> Perhaps because art, particularly in societies with relatively little specialization, is often an integral part of religious, social, and political life. Indeed, most of the aspects of culture we have already discussed—economics, kinship, politics, religion-are also not easily separated from the rest of social life.<sup>2</sup>

Art seems to appear in human history at least as far back as 30,000 years ago. We say that those earliest known carvings, beads, and cave paintings are art, but what do we mean by "art"? A stone spear point, a bone fish hook, obviously required skill and creativity to make. But we do not call them art. Why do we feel that some things are art and others are not?

Some definitions of art emphasize its evocative quality. From the viewpoint of the person who creates it, art expresses feelings and ideas; from the viewpoint of the observer or participant, it evokes feelings and ideas. The feelings and ideas on each side may or may not be exactly the same. And they may be expressed in a variety of ways-drawing, painting, carving, weaving, body decoration, music, dance, story. An artistic work or performance is intended to excite the senses, to stir the emotions of the beholder or participant. It may produce feelings of pleasure, awe, repulsion, fear, but usually not indifference.<sup>3</sup>

But emphasizing the evocative quality of art may make it difficult to compare the art of different cultures because what is evocative in one culture may not be evocative in another. For example, what is a humorous story in one culture may not be funny in another. Thus, most anthropologists agree that art is more than an attempt by an individual to express or communicate feelings and ideas. There is also some cultural patterning or meaning; societies vary in their characteristic kinds and styles of art.<sup>4</sup>

Artistic activities are always in part cultural, involving shared and learned patterns of behavior, belief, and feeling. What are some of the ideas about art in our own culture? We tend to think that anything useful is not art. If the basket has a design that was not necessary to its function, we may possibly consider it art, especially if we keep it on a shelf; but the basket with bread on the table would probably not be considered art. The fact that such a distinction is not made in other societies strongly suggests that our ideas about art are cultural. Among Native Americans on the Northwest Coast, elaborately carved totem poles not only displayed the crests of the lineages of their occupants; they also supported the house.<sup>5</sup> The fact that artistic activities are partly cultural is evident when we compare how people in

In our society, we also insist that to be considered art, a work must be unique. This aspect is clearly consistent with our emphasis on the individual. However, even though we require that artists be unique and innovative, the art they produce must still fall within some range of acceptable variation. Artists must communicate to us in a way we can relate to, or at least learn to relate to. Often, they must follow certain current styles of expression that have been set by other artists or by critics, if they hope to have their art accepted by the public. The idea that an artist should be original is a cultural idea-in some societies the ability to replicate a traditional pattern is more valued than originality.

So art seems to have several qualities. It expresses as well as communicates. It stimulates the senses, affects emotions, and evokes ideas. It is produced in culturally patterned ways and styles; it has cultural meaning. In addition, some people are thought to be better at it than others.<sup>6</sup> Art does not require some people to be full-time artistic specialists; many societies in the ethnographic record had no full-time specialists of any kind. But, although everyone in some societies may participate in some arts (dancing, singing, body decoration), it is usually thought that certain individuals have superior artistic skill.

To illustrate the cross-cultural variation that exists in artistic expression, we will consider first the art of body decoration and adornment.

## BODY DECORATION AND ADORNMENT

In all societies, people decorate or adorn their bodies. The decorations may be permanent—scars, tattoos, changes in the shape of a body part. Or they may be temporary—in the form of paint or objects such as feathers, jewelry, skins, and clothing that are not strictly utilitarian. Much of this decoration seems to be motivated by esthetic considerations, which, of course, may vary from culture to culture. The actual form of the decoration depends on cultural traditions. Body ornamentation includes the pierced noses of some women in India, the elon-

gated necks of the Mangebetu of central Africa, the tattooing of North American males, the body painting of the Caduveo of South America, and the varying ornaments found in almost every culture.

However, in addition to satisfying esthetic needs, body decoration or adornment may be used to delineate social position, rank, sex, occupation, local and ethnic identity, or religion within a society. Along with social stratification come visual means of declaring status. The symbolic halo (the crown) on the king's head, the scarlet hunting jacket of the English gentleman, the eagle feathers of the Native American chief's bonnet, the gold-embroidered jacket of the Indian rajah-each of these marks of high status is recognized in its own society. Jewelry in the shape of a cross or the Star of David indicates Christian or Jewish inclinations. Clothes may set apart the priest or the nun or the member of a sect such as the Amish.

The erotic significance of some body decoration is also apparent. Women draw attention to

Body tattooing sometimes is used to permanently mark status, as with chiefs in Polynesia. But in many places, like among the Dayak of Borneo, tattooing is more personal; people choose to decorate their bodies however they wish.

![](_page_2_Picture_4.jpeg)

erogenous zones of the body by painting, as on the lips, and by attaching some object—an earring, a flower behind the ear, a necklace, bracelet, brooch, anklet, or belt. Men draw attention too, by beards, tattoos, and penis sheaths (in some otherwise naked societies) that point upward. We have only to follow the fashion trends for women of Europe and North America during the past 300 years, with their history of pinched waists, ballooned hips, bustled rumps, exaggerated breasts, painted faces, and exposed bosoms, to realize the significance of body adornment for sexual provocation. Why some societies emphasize the erotic adornment of women and others emphasize it in men is not yet understood.

In many societies the body is permanently marked or altered, often to indicate a change in status. For example, in the Poro initiation ceremony practiced by the Kpelle of Liberia, newly circumcised boys spent a period of seclusion in the forest with the older men. They returned with scars down their backs, symbolic tooth marks indicative of their close escape from *ngamu*, the Great Masked Figure, which ate the child but disgorged the young adult.<sup>7</sup>

The tendency to decorate the human body is probably universal. We have noted some of the various methods people have used to adorn themselves in different societies. We are also aware of bodydecoration practices that raise questions to which we have no ready answers. What explains adornment of the body by permanent marking such as scarification, or by bound feet, elongated ears and necks, shaped heads, pierced ears and septums, and filed teeth? (See the box titled "Politics and Art" for suggestions about the relationship between permanent body marking and politics.) Why do different societies adorn, paint, or otherwise decorate different parts of the body for sexual (or other) reasons? And what leads some members of our society to transfer body decoration to their animals? Why the shaped hair of the poodle, the braided manes of some horses, and diamond collars, painted toenails, coats, hats, and even boots for some pets?

# EXPLAINING VARIATION IN THE ARTS

In our society we stress the freedom of the artist, so it may seem to us that art is completely free to vary. But our emphasis on uniqueness obscures the fact that different cultures not only use or emphasize different materials and have different ideas of beauty, but they also may have characteristic styles

## POLITICS AND ART

Art is exceedingly variable crossculturally. But that does not mean that the variability is unexplainable, not linkable to other aspects of human existence. The various findings described in this chapter indicate that much of art is linkable to other aspects of culture. Here we consider the possibility that even politics, that messy and sometimes volatile arena of human social life, may have reflections in art.

For example, Christopher Steiner's article, "Body Personal and Body Politic," focuses on four forms of self-decorationbody painting, tattooing, masking, and "crowning." (A mask conceals the face and head of the wearer; a crown or other headdress draws attention to, or identifies, the wearer.) Steiner first discusses how body decoration reflects politics in the islands of Melanesia and Polynesia (in the Pacific).

In Melanesia, political leadership is typically of the "big man" type. There is no fixed authority; big men gain influence by attracting followers, who may not follow for long. There are no political offices or permanent positions of authority. And of course there are no centralized chiefdoms and no hierarchy of influential or powerful people. The whole system is fragile and subject to change. In Polynesia, in contrast, there are permanent systems of authority, usually integrating large populations, with a chief or king at the top whose position is usually inherited. Leaders do not achieve their positions by personal action; they succeed to their positions by genealogical right. The system is permanent or nonshifting as well as hierarchical.

Now consider how body adornment may reflect politics in the two areas. Melanesians paint their bodies, and the painting is ephemeral. It disappears within a short time, or after the first wash, just as a big man's status may go up or down quite quickly, depending on what he has done lately for his former followers. Polynesians decorate their bodies with tattoos, which are permanent, as are their systems of leadership. Just as the chief retains his status over time, so a tattoo does not wash away. In Samoa, for example, tattoos distinguished the chiefly class from commoners. Bands and stripes were restricted to persons of high status; low-status persons could have tattoos only of solid black and only from waist to knees. Within the ruling class, the number of tattooed triangles down a

and themes. It is easy to see styles when we look at art that is different from our own; it is harder to see similarity when we look at the art of our own culture. If we look at dance styles, for example, we may think that the dance style of the 1940s is completely different from the dance style of the 1990s. But it might take an outsider to notice that in our culture we still generally see couples dancing as a pair rather than in a group line or circle (as in dances we call "folk dances"). And, in our culture females and males dance together rather than separately. Furthermore, our popular music still has a beat (or combination of beats) and is made by many of the same kinds of instruments as in the past.

But where do these similarities in form and style come from? Much of the recent research on variation in the arts supports the idea that form and

style in visual art, music, dance, and folklore are very much influenced by other aspects of culture. Some psychological anthropologists, as we saw in the chapter on psychology and culture, would go even further, suggesting that art, like religion, expresses the typical feelings, anxieties, and experiences of people in a culture. And the typical feelings and anxieties in turn are influenced by basic institutions such as child rearing, economy, social organization, and politics.

Consider how the physical form of art preferred by a society may reflect its way of life. For example, Richard Anderson pointed out that the art of traditionally nomadic people such as the !Kung, Inuit, and Australian aborigines is mostly carryable.<sup>8</sup> Song, dance, and oral literature are very important in those societies and are as portable as you can get. Those societies decorate useful objects man's leg indicated his relative rank. Because tattooing is permanent, it is a form of body decoration well suited to a society with inherited social stratification.

The traditional political systems of Africa ranged from centralized kingdoms (on the complex end of the continuum) to village-based or segmentary lineage systems in which leadership was ephemeral or secret (tied to secret societies). Masks that conceal identity are often used in the uncentralized systems; crowns or other headdresses indicating high status are frequent in the kingdoms. Among the uncentralized Ibo of eastern Nigeria, masks are often worn by the young men of a village when they criticize the behavior of the village elders. In the kingdom of Ngoyo, in western Zaire, the king's status is indicated by his special cap as well as by his special three-legged stool.

If art may reflect politics on the cultural level, it may also do so on the psychological or individual level. Lewis Austin found that a person's preferences in visual (graphic) symbols can often be predicted from the person's political ideology. Experimental subjects from Japan and the United States were asked to locate themselves on a continuum from radical to conservative and to indicate their preferences in pairs of visual symbols—unbalanced versus balanced, uneven versus even, incomplete versus complete, varying versus uniform. So, for example, a set of bars (as in a bar graph) of the same height is even; bars of different heights are uneven. Conservatives preferred symbols that were orderly (bars side by side ordered from small to large, versus unequal-sized bars lying at angles to each other), passive (a flat line, versus a squiggle or sine wave), and uniform (four squares, versus three squares and a circle). In these terms, the Japanese subjects were more conservative than the American. But in both countries artistic preferences varied in similar ways with political ideology.

If preferences in visual images have a metaphorical significance that is associated with political preferences, perhaps other style preferences (in clothing, furniture, architecture, and so on) also reflect political ideology. Only future research will tell.

that they carry with them-harpoons for the Inuit, boomerangs for the Australian aborigines, ostrich egg "canteens" for the !Kung San. But they don't have bulky things such as sculpture or elaborate costumes. And what about the presence of artists or art critics? Although some people in smaller-scale societies are more artistic than others, specialized artists (as well as critics or theoreticians of art) tend to be found only in societies with a complex and specialized division of labor.

## Visual Art

Perhaps the most obvious way artistic creations reflect how we live is by mirroring the environment the materials and technologies available to a culture. Stone, wood, bones, tree bark, clay, sand, charcoal,

berries for staining, and a few mineral-derived ochers are generally available materials. In addition, depending on the locality, other resources are accessible: shells, horns, tusks, gold, copper, and silver. The different uses to which societies put these materials are of interest to anthropologists, who may ask, for example, why a people chooses to use clay and not copper when both items are available. Although we have no conclusive answers as yet, such questions have important ramifications. The way in which a society views its environment is sometimes apparent in its choice and use of artistic materials. The use of certain metals, for example, may be reserved for ceremonial objects of special importance. Or the belief in the supernatural powers of a stone or tree may cause a sculptor to be sensitive to that particular material.<sup>9</sup>

*The same materials may be used artistically in different* societies. In Japan sand is raked into traditional patterns. A Navaho in the southwestern United States creates a sand painting.

What is particularly meaningful to anthropologists is the realization that, although the materials available to a society may to some extent limit or influence what it can do artistically, the materials by no means determine what is done. Why does the artist in Japanese society rake sand into patterns, the artist in Navaho society paint sand, and the artist in Roman society melt sand to form glass? Moreover, even when the same material is used in the same way by members of different societies, the form or style of the work varies enormously from culture to culture.

A society may choose to represent objects or phenomena that are especially important to its population or elite. An examination of the art of the Middle Ages tells us something about the medieval preoccupation with theological doctrine. In addition to revealing the primary concerns of a society, the content of that society's art may also reflect the culture's social stratification. Authority figures may be represented in rather obvious ways. In the art of ancient Sumerian society, the sovereign was portrayed as being much larger than his followers, and the most prestigious gods were given oversized eyes. Also, as we have seen, differences in clothing and jewelry styles within a society usually reflect social stratification.

Certain possible relationships between the art of a society and other aspects of its culture have always been recognized by art historians. Much of this attention has been concentrated on the content of art, since European art has been representational for such a long time. But the style of the art may reflect other aspects of culture. John Fischer, for example, examined the stylistic features of art with the aim of discovering "some sort of regular connection between some artistic feature and some social situation."<sup>10</sup> He argued that the artist expresses a form of social fantasy. In other words, in a stable society artists will respond to those conditions in the society that bring them, and the society, security or pleasure.

Assuming that "pictorial elements in design are, on one psychological level, abstract, mainly unconscious representations of persons in the society,"11 Fischer reasoned that egalitarian societies would tend to have different stylistic elements in their art than stratified societies. Egalitarian societies are generally composed of small, self-sufficient communities that are structurally similar and have little differentiation between persons. Stratified societies, on the other hand, generally have larger and more interdependent (and dissimilar) communities

and great differences among persons in prestige, power, and access to economic resources. Fischer hypothesized, and found in a cross-cultural study, that certain elements of design were strongly related to the presence of social hierarchy. His findings are summarized in Table 16-1.

Repetition of a simple element, for example, tends to be found in the art of egalitarian societies, which have little political organization and few authority positions. If each element unconsciously represents individuals within the society, the relative sameness of people seems to be reflected in the repetitiveness of design elements. Conversely, the combining of different design elements in complex patterns that tends to be found in the art of stratified societies seems to reflect the high degree of social differentiation that exists in such societies.

According to Fischer, the egalitarian society's empty space in a design represents the society's relative isolation. Because egalitarian societies are usually small and self-sufficient, they tend to shy away from foreigners, preferring to find security within their own group. On the other hand, the art of stratified societies is generally crowded. The hierarchical society does not seek to isolate individuals or communities within the group because they must be interdependent, each social level ideally furnishing services for those above it and help for those beneath it. As Fischer suggested, we can, in general, discern a lack of empty space in the designs of societies in which security is not sought by avoiding strangers, but rather "security is produced by incorporating strangers into the hierarchy, through dominance or submission as the relative power indicates."12

Symmetry, the third stylistic feature related to type of society, is similar to the first. Symmetry may suggest likeness or an egalitarian society; asymmetry suggests difference and perhaps stratification. The fourth feature of interest here, the presence or absence of enclosures or boundaries ("frames" in our art), may indicate the presence or absence of hierarchically imposed rules circumscribing individual behavior. An unenclosed design may reflect free access to most property; in egalitarian societies the fencing off of a piece of property for the use of only one person is unknown. In the art of stratified societies, boundaries or enclosures may reflect the idea of private property. Or they may symbolically represent the real differences in dress, occupation, type of food allowed, and manners that separate the different classes of people.

Studies such as Fischer's offer anthropologists new tools with which to evaluate ancient societies that are known only by a few pieces of pottery or a few tools or paintings. If art reflects certain aspects of a culture, then the study of whatever art of a people has been preserved may provide a means of testing the accuracy of the guesses we make about their culture on the basis of more ordinary archaeological materials. For example, even if we did not know from classical Greek writings that Athens became more and more socially stratified between 1000 B.C. and 450 B.C., we might guess that such a transformation had occurred because of the changes we can see over time in the way the Athenians decorated vases. Consistent with Fischer's cross-cultural findings, as Athens became more stratified, its vase painting became more complex, more crowded, and more enclosed.<sup>13</sup>

#### Music

When we hear the music of another culture, we often don't know what to make of it. We may say it does not "mean" anything to us, hardly realizing that the meaning of music has been programmed into us by our culture. In music as well as in art, our culture largely determines what we consider acceptable variation, what we say has "meaning" to us. Even a trained musicologist, listening for the first time to music of a different culture, will not be able to hear the subtleties of tone and rhythm that members of the culture hear with ease. His or her predicament is similar to that of the linguist who, exposed to a foreign language, cannot at first distinguish phonemes, morphemes, and other regular patterns of speech.

Not only do instruments vary, but music itself varies widely in style from society to society. For example, in some societies people prefer music with a regularly recurring beat; in others they prefer changes in rhythm. There are also variations in

#### DO MASKS SHOW EMOTION IN UNIVERSAL WAYS?

Anthropologists have documented how forms and styles in art vary from culture to culture. But with all this variation, it seems that certain forms of art may show emotion in universally similar ways. For example, recent research on masks from different cultures supports the conclusion that masks (like faces) tend to represent certain emotions in the same ways.

Face masks are commonly used in rituals and performances. They not only hide the real face of the mask wearer but they often evoke powerful emotions in the audience—anger, fear, sadness, joy. You might think, because so many things vary cross-culturally, that the ways in which emotion is displayed and recognized in the face vary too. But apparently they do not. We now have some evidence

that the symbolism used in masks is often universal.

The research on masks builds on work done by Ekman and Izard, who used photographs of individuals experiencing (or actors simulating) various emotions. Ekman and Izard showed photographs to members of different cultural groups and asked them to identify the emotions displayed in the photographs. A particular emotion was identified correctly by most viewers, whatever the viewer's native culture. The results for the viewers from less Westernized cultures paralleled the results for viewers from more Westernized cultures. Coding schemes were developed to enable researchers to compare the detailed facial positions of individual portions of the face (eyebrows, mouth, etc.) for different emotions. What exactly do we do when we scowl? We contract the eyebrows and lower the corners of the mouth; in geometric terms, we make angles and diagonals on our faces. When we smile, we raise the corners of the mouth; we make it curved.

Psychologist Joel Aronoff and his colleagues compared two types of wooden face masks from many different societies-masks described as threatening (for example, designed to frighten off evil spirits) versus masks associated with nonthreatening functions (for example, a courtship dance). As suspected, the two sets of masks had significantly different proportions of certain facial elements. The threatening masks had eyebrows and eyes facing inward and downward and a downward-facing mouth.

singing styles. In some places it is customary to have different vocal lines for different people; in other places people all sing together in the same way.

Is variation in music, as in the other arts, related to other aspects of culture? On the basis of a cross-cultural study of more than 3,500 folk songs from a sample of the world's societies, Alan Lomax and his co-researchers found that song style seems to vary with cultural complexity. As we will see, these findings about variation in song style are similar to Fischer's findings about variation in art.

Lomax and his co-researchers found some features of song style to be correlated with cultural complexity. (The societies classified as more complex tend to have higher levels of food-production technology, social stratification, and higher levels of political integration.) For example, wordiness and

clearness of enunciation were found to be associated with cultural complexity. The association is a reasonable one: the more a society depends on verbal information, as in giving complex instructions for a job or explaining different points of law, the more strongly will clear enunciation in the transmitting of information be a mark of its culture. Thus, huntergatherer bands, in which people know their productive role and perform it without ever being given complex directions, are more likely than we are to base much of their singing on lines of nonwords, such as our refrain line "tra-la-la-la." Their songs are characterized by lack of explicit information, by sounds that give pleasure in themselves, by much repetition, and by relaxed, slurred enunciation.<sup>14</sup>

Examples of the progression from repetition or nonwords to wordy information are found

![](_page_8_Picture_0.jpeg)

The threatening masks also were more likely to have pointed heads, chins, beards, and ears, as well as projections from the face such as horns. In more abstract or geometrical terms, threatening features generally tend to be angular or diagonal, and nonthreatening features tend to be curved or rounded. A face with a pointed beard is threatening; a baby's face is not. The theory (originally suggested by Charles Darwin, the evolutionist) is that humans express and recognize basic emotions in uniform ways because all human faces are quite similar, skeletally and muscularly.

But is it the facial features themselves that convey threat or is it the design elements of angularity and diagonality that convey threat? To help answer this question, students in this country were asked to associate adjectives with drawings of abstract pairs of design features (for example, a  $V$ shape and a  $U$  shape). Even with abstract shapes, the angular patterns were thought of as less "good," more "powerful" and as "stronger" than the curved shapes.

We should not be surprised to discover that humans all over the world use their faces (and masks) to show emotions in the same ways. Aren't we all members of the same species? Our skin color may vary from dark brown to white (or "swine pink," according to some). Our hair may be straight or wavy or kinky-or skimpy. We vary in the percentages of a lot of characteristics. But those are the characteristics we see. We are not so likely to notice the things about us (by far most of the things about us) that don't vary-such as how we show emotion in our faces. That's why a movie made in Hollywood or

Beijing may evoke the same feelings wherever people see it. The universality of human emotion as expressed in the face becomes obvious only when we see faces (and masks) from elsewhere, showing emotions in ways that are unmistakable to us.

Thus, we become aware of universality (in masks as well as other cultural things) in the same way we become aware of variation-by exposure though reading and direct experience to the ways cultures do and do not vary.

within our society. The most obvious (and universal) example of a song made entirely of repetition is the relaxed lullaby of a mother repeating a comforting syllable to her baby while improvising her own tune. But this type of song is not characteristic of our society. Although our songs sometimes have single lines of nonwords, it is rare for an entire song to be made of them. Usually, the nonwords act as respites from information:

> Zippity do dah Zippety ay My o my What a wonderful day<sup>15</sup>

In associating variation in music with cultural complexity, Lomax found that elaboration of song

parts also corresponds to the complexity of a society. Societies in which leadership is informal and temporary seem to symbolize their social equality by an *interlocked* style of singing: each person sings independently but within the group, and no one singer is differentiated from the others. Rank societies, in which there is a leader with prestige but no real power, are characterized by a song style in which one "leader" may begin the song, but the others soon drown out his voice. In stratified societies, where leaders have the power of force, choral singing is generally marked by a clearcut role for the leader and a secondary "answering" role for the others. Societies marked by elaborate stratification show singing parts that are differentiated and in which the soloist is deferred to by the other singers.

![](_page_9_Picture_0.jpeg)

Symmetry and the repetition of design elements tend to be found in the art of unstratified societies, as in this Navaho blanket, ca. 1887. Stratified societies are more likely to have asymmetry and different design elements, as in this nineteenth-century Japanese painting.

Lomax also found a relationship between polyphony (two or more melodies sung simultaneously) and a high degree of female participation in food-getting. In societies in which women's work is responsible for at least half of the food, songs are likely to contain more than one simultaneous melody, with the higher tunes usually sung by women. Moreover:

Counterpoint was once believed to be the invention of European high culture. In our sample it turns out to be most frequent among simple producers, especially gatherers, where women supply the bulk of the food. Counterpoint and perhaps even polyphony may then be very old feminine inventions. . . . Subsistence complementarity is at its maximum among gatherers, early gardeners, and horticulturalists. It is in

such societies that we find the highest occurrence of polyphonic singing.<sup>16</sup>

In societies in which women do not contribute much to production, the songs are more likely to have a single melody and to be sung by males.<sup>17</sup>

In some societies, survival and social welfare are based on a unified group effort; in those cultures, singing tends to be marked by cohesiveness. That is, cohesive work parties, teams of gatherers or harvesters and kin groups who work voluntarily for the good of the family or community, seem to express their interconnectedness in song by blending both tone and rhythm.

Some variations in music may be explained as a consequence of variation in child-rearing practices. For example, researchers are beginning to explore child-rearing practices as a way to explain why some societies respond to, and produce, regular rhythm in their music, whereas others enjoy free rhythm that has no regular beat but instead approximates the rhythm of speech.

One hypothesis is that a regular beat in music is a simulation of the regular beat of the heart. For nine months in the womb, the fetus feels the mother's regular eighty or so heartbeats a minute. Moreover, mothers generally employ rhythmic tactics in quieting crying infants-patting their backs or rocking them. But the fact that children respond positively to an even tempo does not mean that the regular heartbeat is completely responsible for their sensitivity to rhythm. In fact, if the months in the womb were sufficient to establish a preference for rhythm, then every child would be affected in exactly the same manner by a regular beat, and all societies would have the same rhythm in their music.

Barbara Ayres suggested that the importance of regular rhythm in the music of a culture is related to the rhythm's acquired reward value—that is, its associations with feelings of security or relaxation. In a cross-cultural study of this possibility, Ayres found a strong correlation between a society's method of carrying infants and the type of musical rhythm the society produced. In some societies, the mother or an older sister carries the child, sometimes for two or three years, in a sling, pouch, or shawl, so that the child is in bodily contact with her for much of the day and experiences the motion of her rhythmic walking. Ayres discovered that such societies tend to have a regularly recurring beat in their songs. Societies in which the child is put into a cradle or is strapped to a cradleboard tend to have music based either on irregular rhythm or on free rhythm.<sup>18</sup>

The question of why some societies have great tonal ranges in music whereas others do not was also studied by Ayres, who suggested that this difference too might be explained by certain child-rearing practices. Ayres theorized that painful stimulation of infants before weaning might result in bolder, more exploratory behavior in adulthood, which would be apparent in the musical patterns of the culture. This hypothesis was suggested to her by laboratory experiments with animals. Contrary to expectations, those animals given electric shocks or handled before weaning showed greater than usual physical growth and more exploratory behavior when placed in new situations as adults. Ayres equated the range of musical notes (from low to high) with the exploratory range of animals and forcefulness of accent in music with boldness in animals.

The kinds of stress Ayres looked for in ethnographic reports were those that would be applied to all children or to all of one sex—for example, scarification; piercing of the nose, lips, or ears; binding, shaping, or stretching of feet, head, ears, or any limb; inoculation; circumcision; or cauterization. The results showed that in societies in which infants are stressed before the age of two, music is marked by a wider tonal range than in societies in which children are not stressed or are stressed only at a later age. Also, a firm accent or beat is characteristic of music more often in societies that subject children to stress than in societies that do not.<sup>19</sup>

Cultural emphasis on obedience or independence in children is another variable that may explain some aspects of musical performance. In societies in which children are generally trained for compliance, cohesive singing predominates. In soci-

Just as in art and song, dance style seems to reflect societal complexity. In less complex societies, everyone participates in dances in much the same way, as among the Huli of New Guinea. In more complex societies, there

eties in which children are encouraged to be assertive, singing is mostly individualized. Moreover, assertive training of children is associated with a raspy voice or harsh singing. A raspy voice seems to be an indication of assertiveness and is most often a male voice quality. Interestingly enough, in societies in which women's work predominates in subsistence production, the women sing with harsher voices.

Other voice characteristics may also be associated with elements of culture. For example, sexual restrictions in a society seem to be associated with voice restrictions, especially with a nasalized or narrow, squeezed tone. These voice qualities are associated with anxiety and are especially noticeable in sounds of pain, deprivation, or sorrow. Restrictive sexual practices may be a source of pain and anxiety, and the nasal tone in song may reflect such emotions.<sup>20</sup>

If the cross-cultural results about music are valid, they should be able to explain change over time as well as variation within a society. Future research in a variety of societies may help test some of the theories of Lomax and Ayres.<sup>21</sup>

## Folklore

**Folklore** is a broad category including all the myths, legends, folktales, ballads, riddles, proverbs, and superstitions of a cultural group.<sup>22</sup> In general, folklore is transmitted orally, but it may also be written. All societies have a repertoire of stories that they tell to entertain each other and teach children. Examples of our folklore include fairy tales and the legends we tell about our folk heroes, such as George Washington's confessing that he chopped down the cherry tree.

Folklore is not always clearly separable from the other arts, particularly music and dance; stories often are conveyed in those contexts. (Games are also sometimes considered folklore, although they may be learned by imitation as well as transmitted orally.)

Although some folklore scholars emphasize the traditional aspects of folklore and the continuity between the present and the past, more recently many scholars have paid attention to the innovative and emergent aspects of folklore. In this view, folklore is constantly created by any social group that has shared experiences. So, for example, computer programmers may have their jokes and their own proverbs (for example, "Garbage in, garbage out!").<sup>23</sup> Jan Brunvald compiled a set of recently arisen urban legends. One such legend is "The Hook." The story, which has many versions, is basically about a young couple parked on Lover's Lane with the radio on. There is an announcement that a killer with an artificial hand is loose, so the girl suggests that they leave. The boy starts the car and drives her home. When he walks around the car to open her door, he finds a bloody hook attached to the door handle.<sup>24</sup> There are even legends on college campuses. What is the answer to the question of how long students should wait for a tardy professor? Students have an answer, ranging from ten to twenty minutes. Is this a rule, or only a legend? Brunvald reported that he never found a regulation about how long to wait for the professor on any campus that tells this story!25

Some folklore scholars are interested in universal or recurrent themes. Clyde Kluckhohn suggested that five themes occur in the myths and folktales of all societies: catastrophe, generally through flood; the slaying of monsters; incest; sibling rivalry, generally between brothers; and castration, sometimes actual but more commonly symbolic.<sup>26</sup> Edward Tylor, who proposed that religion is born from the human need to explain states such as dreams and death, suggested that hero myths follow a similar pattern the world overthe central character is exposed at birth, is subsequently saved by others (humans or animals), and grows up to become a hero.<sup>27</sup> Joseph Campbell argued that hero myths resemble initiations-the hero is separated from the ordinary world, ventures forth into a new world (in this case, the supernatural world) to triumph over powerful forces, and then returns to the ordinary world with special powers to help others.<sup>28</sup>

Myths may indeed have universal themes, but few scholars have looked at a representative sample of the world's societies, and therefore we cannot be sure that the conclusions about universality reached so far are correct. Indeed, most folklore researchers have not been interested in universal themes, but rather in the particular folktales told in specific societies or regions. For example, some scholars have focused on the "Star Husband Tale," a common Native American tale. Stith Thompson presented eighty-four versions of this tale—his goal was to reconstruct the original version and pinpoint its place of origin. By identifying the most common elements, Thompson suggested that the basic story (and probably the original) is the following:

> Two girls sleeping out of doors wish that stars would be their husbands. In their sleep the girls are taken to the sky where they find themselves married to stars, one of which is a young man and the other an old man. The women are warned not to dig, but they disregard the warning and accidentally open up a hole in the sky. Unaided they descend on a rope and arrive home safely.<sup>29</sup>

The tale, Thompson suggested, probably originated in the Plains and then spread to other regions of North America.

Alan Dundes has concentrated on the structure of folktales; he thinks that Native American folktales, including the Star Husband Tale, have characteristic structures. One is a movement away from disequilibrium. Equilibrium is the desirable state; having too much or too little of anything is a condition that should be rectified as soon as possible. Disequilibrium, which Dundes calls lack, is indicated by the girls in the Star Husband Tale who do not have husbands. The lack is then corrected, in this case by marriage with the stars. This tale has another common Native American structure, says Dundes—a sequence of prohibition, interdiction, violation, and consequence. The women are warned not to dig, but they do—and as a consequence they escape for home.<sup>30</sup> It should be noted that the consequences in folktales around the world are not always good. Recall the Garden of Eden tale. The couple are warned not to eat the fruit of a tree; they eat the fruit; they are cast out of their paradise. Similarly, Icarus in the Greek tale is warned not to fly too high or low. He flies too high; the sun melts the wax that holds his feathered wings, and he falls and drowns.

As useful as it might be to identify where certain tales originated, or what their common structures might be, many questions remain. What do the tales mean? Why did they arise in the first place? Why are certain structures common in Native American tales? We are still a long way from answering many of these questions, and trying to answer them is difficult. How does one try to understand the meaning of a tale?

It is easy for people to read different meanings into the same myth. For example, consider the myth the Hebrews told of a paradise in which only a man was present until Eve, the first woman, arrived and ate the forbidden fruit of knowledge. One might conclude that men in that society had some traditional grudge against women. If the interpreter were a psychoanalyst, he or (especially) she might assume that the myth reflected the male's deeply hidden fears of female sexuality. A historian might believe that the myth reflected actual historical events and that men were living in blissful ignorance until women invented agriculture (the effect of Eve's "knowledge" led to a life of digging rather than gathering).

It is clearly not enough to suggest an interpretation. Why should we believe it? We should give it serious consideration only if some systematic test seems to support it. For example, Michael Carroll suggested a Freudian interpretation of the Star Husband Tale—that the tale represents repressed sentiments in the society. Specifically, he suggested that incestuous intercourse is the underlying concern of this myth, particularly the desire of a daughter to have intercourse with her father. He assumed that the stars symbolize fathers. Fathers, like stars, are high above, in children's eyes. Carroll predicted that if the Star Husband Tale originated on the Plains, and if it symbolizes intercourse, then the Plains tribes should be more likely than other tribes to have intercourse imagery in their versions of the tale. That seems to be the case: analyzing eighty-four versions of the tale, Carroll found that Plains societies are the Native American tribes most likely to have imagery suggesting intercourse, including the lowering of a rope or ladder (presumably symbolizing the penis) through a sky hole (presumably symbolizing the vagina).<sup>31</sup>

Few studies as yet have investigated why there is cross-cultural variation in the frequency of certain features in folktales. One feature of folktale variation that has been investigated cross-culturally is aggression. George Wright found that variation in child-rearing patterns predicted some aspects of how aggression is exhibited in folktales. Where children are severely punished for aggression, more intense aggression appears in the folktales. And in such societies, strangers are more likely than the hero or friends of the hero to be the aggressors in the folktales. It seems that where children may be afraid to exhibit aggression toward their parents or those close to them because of fear of punishment, the hero or his or her close friends in folktales are also not likely to be aggressive.<sup>32</sup>

Other kinds of fears may be reflected in folktales. A recent cross-cultural study found that unprovoked aggression is likely in folktales of societies that are subject to unpredictable food shortages. Why? One possibility is that the folktales reflect reality; after all, a serious drought may seem capricious, not possibly provoked by any human activity, brought on by the gods or nature "out of the blue." Curiously, however, societies with a history of unpredictable food shortages hardly mention natural disasters in their folktales, perhaps because disasters are too frightening. In any case, the capriciousness of unpredictable disasters seems to be transformed into the capricious aggression of characters in the folktales.<sup>33</sup>

Folklore, just like other aspects of art, may at least partially reflect the feelings, needs, and conflicts that people acquire as a result of growing up in their culture.

## VIEWING THE ART OF OTHER CULTURES

Sally Price raised some critical questions about how Western museums and art critics look at the visual art of less complex cultures. Why is it that when artworks from Western or Oriental civilizations are displayed in a museum here, they carry the artist's name? In contrast, art from less complex cultures (often labeled "primitive art") tends to be displayed without the name of the artist; instead it often is accompanied by a description of where it came from, how it was constructed, and what it may be used for. More words of explanation seem to accompany displays of unfamiliar art. Price suggested that the art pieces that we consider the most worthy require the least labeling, subtly conveying that the viewer needs no help to judge a real work of art.<sup>34</sup> In addition, art acquired from less complex cultures tends to be labeled by the name of the Westerner who acquired it. It is almost as if the fame of the collector, not the art itself, sets the value of such art.<sup>35</sup>

Just as the art from less complex cultures tends to be nameless, it also tends to be treated as timeless. We recognize that Western art and the art from classical civilizations changes over time, which is why it must be dated, but the art from other places seems to be viewed as representing a timeless cultural tradition.<sup>36</sup> Do we know that the art of peoples with simpler technology changes less, or is this assumption a kind of ethnocentrism? Price, who has studied the art of the Saramakas of Suriname, points out that although Westerners think of Saramakan art as still representing its African ancestry, Saramakans themselves can identify shifts in their art styles over time. For example, they describe how calabashes used to be decorated on the outside, then the style changed to decorating the inside. They can also recognize the artist who made particular carved calabashes as well as identify those who were innovators of designs and techniques.<sup>37</sup>

Although it seems that individual artists can usually be recognized in any community, some societies do appear to be more "communal" than others in their art style. For example, let us compare the Puebloan peoples of the Southwest with native peoples of the Great Plains. Traditionally, women Puebloan potters did not sign their pots, and they largely followed their pueblo's characteristic style. In contrast, each Plains warrior stressed his individual accomplishments by painting representations of those accomplishments on animal hides. Either the warrior would do it himself or he would ask someone else to do it for him. These hides were worn by the warrior or displayed outside his tipi.<sup>38</sup>

When Westerners do notice artistic changes over time in less complex societies, it seems to be because they are concerned about whether the art represents traditional forms or is "tourist art." Tourist art is often evaluated negatively. Perhaps the negative evaluation results from its association with money. But famous Western artists often also worked for fees or were supported by elite patrons, and yet the fact that they were paid does not seem to interfere with our evaluation of their art.<sup>39</sup>

# ARTISTIC CHANGE AND CULTURE CONTACT

It is unquestionably true that contact with the West did alter some aspects of the art of other cultures, but that does not imply that their art was changeless before. What kinds of things changed with contact? In some places, artists began to represent European contact itself. For example, in Australia, numerous rock paintings by aborigines portray sailing ships, men on horseback carrying pistols, and even cattle brands. With encouragement from Europeans, indigenous artists also began drawing on tree bark, canvas, and masonite to sell to Europeans. Interestingly, the art for sale mostly emphasizes themes displayed before contact and does not include representations of ships and guns.<sup>40</sup> As aboriginal populations were decimated by European contact, a lot of their traditional art forms disappeared, particularly legends and rock paintings that were associated with the sacred sites of each clan. The legends described the creation of the sacred places, and art motifs with painted human or animal heroes marked the sites.41

In North America, contact between native groups produced changes in art even before the Europeans came. Copper, sharks' teeth, and marine shells were traded extensively in precontact times and were used in the artwork of people who did not have access to those materials locally. Ceremonies were borrowed between groups, and with the new ceremonies came changes in artistic traditions. Borrowing from other native groups continued after European contact. The Navaho, who are well known today for their rug weaving, were not weavers in the seventeenth century. They probably obtained their weaving technology from the Hopi and then began to weave wool and herd sheep. European contact also produced material changes in art-new materials including beads, wool cloth, and silver were introduced. Metal tools such as needles and scissors could now be used to make more tailored and more decorated skin clothing. In the Northwest, the greater availability of metal tools made it possible to make larger totem poles and house posts.<sup>42</sup>

After they were placed on reservations, virtually all Native Americans had to change their ways of making a living. Selling arts and crafts earned some of them supplementary income. Most of these crafts used traditional techniques and traditional designs, altered somewhat to suit European expectations. Outsiders played important roles in encouraging changes in arts and crafts. Some storekeepers became patrons to particular artists who were then able to devote themselves full-time to their craft. Traders would often encourage changes such as new objects (for example, ashtrays and cups made of pottery). Scholars have played a role too. Some have helped artisans learn about styles of the past that had disappeared. For example, with the encouragement of anthropologists and others in the Santa Fe area, Maria and Julian Martinez of San Ildefonso Pueblo brought back a polished black-on-black pottery style originally produced by nearby ancient peoples.<sup>43</sup>

Some of the artistic changes that have occurred after contact with the West are partly predictable from the results of cross-cultural research on artistic variation. Remember that Fischer found that egalitarian societies typically had less complex designs and more symmetry than did stratified societies. With the loss of traditional ways of making a living and with the increase in wage labor and commercial enterprises, many Native American groups have become more socially stratified. Ex-

The polished black-on-black pottery style was revived in recent times by Maria and Julian Martinez of San Ildefonso Pueblo in New Mexico. Shown here is a pot by Maria and Santana.

trapolating from Fischer's results, we would predict that designs on visual art should become more complex and asymmetrical as social stratification increases. Indeed, if early reservation art (1870-1901) among the Shoshone-Bannock of southeastern Idaho is compared with their recent art (1973-1983), it is clear that the art has become more complex as social stratification has increased.<sup>44</sup> It could also be true that the art changed because the artists came to realize that more asymmetry and complexity would sell better to people who collect art.

## V SUMMARY

1. Not all societies have a word for art, but art universally seems to have several qualities. It expresses as well as communicates. It stimulates the senses, affects emotions, and evokes ideas. It is produced in culturally patterned ways and styles; it has cultural meaning. And some people are thought to be better at it than others.

2. All societies decorate or adorn the body, temporarily or permanently. But there is enormous cultural variation in the parts decorated and how. Body decoration may be used to delineate social position, sex, or occupation. It may also have an erotic significance—for example, in drawing attention to erogenous zones of the body.

3. The materials used to produce visual art, the way those materials are used, and the natural objects the artist may choose to represent all vary from society to society and reveal much about a society's relation to its environment. Some studies indicate a correlation between artistic design and social stratification.
