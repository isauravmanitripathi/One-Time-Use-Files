# Applied Anthropology<br>and Social Problems

![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg)

The news on radio and television and in our newspapers makes us aware every day that social problems threaten people around the world. From war to crime and family violence, from AIDS to poverty and famine, the pursuit of happiness and even life itself are jeopardized for many people in many places.

Worldwide communication has increased our awareness of problems elsewhere, and we seem to be increasingly bothered by problems in our own society. For these two reasons, and perhaps also because we know more than we used to about human behavior, we may be more motivated now to try to solve those problems. We call them "social" problems not only because a lot of people worry about them but also because they have social causes or consequences, and their possible treatments or solutions require at least some changes in social behavior. For example, AIDS may be caused by a family of viruses, but it is also a social problem because it is mostly transmitted by sexual contact with another person and the only ways to avoid it now (abstinence, "safe" sex) require changes in social behavior. And it is a social problem also because millions of people are put at risk by the global epidemic.

Anthropology and most of the other social sciences have long been concerned with social problems. One way in which this concern is expressed is through "basic research" that tests theories about the possible causes of social problems. The results of such tests could suggest solutions to the problems if the causes, once discovered, can be reduced or eliminated. The other way to be concerned with social problems is to participate in programs intended to improve people's lives. In anthropology, this second way is referred to as applied anthropology or practicing anthropology. Applied or practicing anthropologists may be involved in one or more phases of a program: assembling relevant knowledge, constructing alternative plans, assessing the likely social and environmental impact of particular plans, implementing the program, and monitoring the program and its effects.<sup>1</sup>

Clearly, theory testing and applied research may both be motivated by a desire to improve the quality of human life. But it is often difficult to decide if a particular project is basic or applied. For example, consider a study of the possible causes of war; its results may suggest how the risk of war might be reduced. Is such a study basic or applied research?

This chapter has two major parts. The first deals with applied or practicing anthropology. We discuss the history and types of application in the United States, the ethical issues involved in trying to

improve people's lives, the difficulties in evaluating whether a program is beneficial, and problems in instituting planned change. In the second part of the chapter we turn to the study of global social problems and how understanding the possible causes of these problems may suggest possible solutions. We focus on research done by anthropologists and comparativists from other disciplines that may help us better understand the spread of AIDS, disasters, homelessness, crime, family violence, and war.

# APPLIED AND PRACTICING ANTHROPOLOGY

Anthropologists care and worry about the people they study, just as they care and worry about family and friends back home. It is upsetting if most of the families in your place of fieldwork have lost many of their babies to diseases that could be eliminated by medical care. It is upsetting when outside political and economic interests threaten to deprive your fieldwork friends of their resources and pride. Anthropologists have usually studied people who are disadvantaged-by imperialism, colonialism, and other forms of exploitation. And so it is no wonder that we feel protective about these people, whom we have lived and shared with in the field.

But caring is not enough to improve others' lives. We may need basic research that allows us to understand how a condition might be successfully treated. A particular proposed "improvement" might actually not be an improvement; wellmeaning efforts have sometimes produced harmful consequences. And even if we know that a change would be an improvement, there is still the problem of how to make it happen. The people to be affected may not want to change. Is it ethical to try to persuade them? And conversely, is it ethical not to try? Applied anthropologists must take all of these matters into consideration in determining whether and how to act in response to a perceived need.

Applied anthropology in the United States developed out of anthropologists' personal experiences with disadvantaged people in other cultures.<sup>2</sup> But today anthropologists are also interested in studying and solving problems in our own society. Anthropologists who call themselves applied or practicing anthropologists are usually employed in nonacademic settings, working for government and international agencies and sometimes even for corporations (see the box titled "Anthropology and Business"). Today there are more anthropologists

# ANTHROPOLOGY AND BUSINESS

![](_page_2_Picture_2.jpeg)

Applied anthropologist Jill Kleinberg and clients

Chemistry, biology, and psychology are just some of the scientific fields from which businesses have routinely hired substantial numbers of researchers. But it is only relatively recently that business people have come to realize that anthropologists have useful knowledge to contribute, particularly with the globalization of trade, the increase in international investments and joint ventures, and the spread of multinational corporations.

What can anthropology offer? One of the most important contributions of anthropology is understanding how much culture can influence relationships between people of different cultures. For example, anthropologists know that communication

is much more than the formal understanding of another language. In the chapter on communication and language, we discussed the "ethnography of speaking," which investigates the social contexts of speech as well as nonverbal communication. Knowledge of the cultural patterns accompanying communication is extremely important for business. People in some countries, such as the United States, expect explicit, straightforward verbal messages. But people in other countries are more indirect in their verbal messages. In Japan and China, for example, negative messages are less likely than messages expressing politeness and harmony. Many Eastern cultures have ways of saying no without saying the word. Still other countries, particularly Arab countries, tend to be very elaborate in their speech, using long strings of adjectives and repeated pronouns to dramaticize messages.

It is often important to understand the nonverbal cues used in the other culture. How close should you stand when you talk to someone? Should you avoid looking at someone else's eyes? When and where and how to touch are very culture-specific. Some cultures touch a lot, others consider touching to be insulting. And where you touch is very important! In the United States, if a male takes another male's hand when walking side by side, it is considered a homosexual gesture, but in Kenya and other places it has no such implication; it is simply an expression of friendship.

It is also important to understand that different cultures may have different values. People in the United States place a high value on the individual, but as we discussed in the chapter on psychology and culture, the importance of relationships with others may take precedence over individual needs in other places. People in the United States emphasize the future, youth, informality, and competitiveness, but in other places the emphases are often the opposite. In any business arrangement, perhaps no difference is as salient as the value

a culture places on time. As we say, "Time is money." If a meeting is arranged and the other person is late, say forty-five minutes late, people from the United States consider it rude; but such a delay is well within the range of acceptable behavior in many South American countries.

Anthropologists have helped businesses become aware of their own "cultures" (sometimes referred to as organizational cultures). The organizational culture of a business may interfere with the acceptance of new kinds of workers, or it may interfere with changing business needs. If parts of that culture need to be changed, it is necessary first to identify what the culture involves and to understand how and why it developed the way it did. Anthropologists know how to identify cultural patterns on the basis of systematic observation and interviewing of individuals.

Jill Kleinberg provided an example of trying to understand organizational culture. She studied six Japanese-owned firms in the United States to understand the impact of both the larger culture and the organizational culture of the workplace. All six firms employed both Japanese and Americans, although the Japanese dominated the managerial positions. The main goal of the study was to discover why there was considerable tension in all the firms.

Before she could make recommendations about how to reduce the tension, Kleinberg had to figure out what was wrong. Her first order of business was to interview people about their views of work and their jobs. She found clear differences between the Japanese and the American employees that seemed to reflect broader cultural differences. Americans wanted a clear definition of the job and its attached responsibilities, and they also wanted their job titles, authority, rights, and pay to match closely. The Japanese, on the other hand, emphasized the need to be flexible in their responsibilities as well as their tasks. They also felt that part of their responsibility was to help their co-workers. (See the box titled "Do Schools Teach Values", in the chapter on psychology and culture, in which we discussed Japanese preschools and their emphasis on the good of the group.) Americans were uncomfortable in these firms because the Japanese managers did not indicate exactly what the workers were supposed to do; even if there was a job description, the manager did not appear to pay attention to it. Americans were given little information, were left out of decision making, and were frustrated by the lack of opportunity to advance. The Japanese thought that the Americans were too hard to manage, too concerned with money and authority, and too concerned with their own interests.

Dissatisfaction is a problem in any business. Absenteeism, high turnover, and lack of incentive on the job all detract from job performance and business capability. Kleinberg recommended giving all employees more information about the company as well as conducting training sessions about cross-cultural differences in business cultures. She also recommended making the Japanese philosophy of management more explicit during the hiring process so that the company would be able to find Americans who were more comfortable with that philosophy. But she also suggested that the managerial structure be somewhat "Americanized" so that American employees could be more comfortable. Finally, she recommended that Americans be given more managerial positions and contact with their Japanese counterparts overseas. These suggestions might not eliminate all problems, but they would increase mutual understanding and trust.

In a way, then, as Andrew Miracle noted, the work of the practicing anthropologist is similar to the shaman's in traditional societies. Shamans feel called to their roles as forecasters and healers, but their skills are not automatic—shamanistic work usually requires practice and the acquisition of many practical skills, often as an apprentice. The people who call on shamans for help believe in their abilities to help, and the shaman tries to find ways to empower the client to think positively. To be sure, there are cont.

profound differences between a shaman and an applied anthropologist. Perhaps the most important is that the applied anthropologist uses research, not trance or magic, to effect an organizational cure. Like a shaman, however, the applied anthropologist must make an understandable diagnosis and help the client see the way to health and restored power.

working in nonacademic than in academic settings.<sup>3</sup> These practicing anthropologists often work on specific projects that aim to improve people's lives in particular places, usually by trying to change behavior or the environment; or the anthropologists monitor or evaluate efforts by others to bring about change.<sup>4</sup> Usually the problems and projects are defined by the employers or clients (the client is sometimes the "target" population), not by the anthropologists who may be employed.<sup>5</sup> But anthropologists are increasingly called upon to participate in deciding exactly what improvements might be possible, as well as how to achieve them.

### History and Types of Application

Until World War II, almost all anthropologists in the United States were employed in colleges, universities, and museums, and applied anthropology was practically nonexistent. In 1934, John Collier, the head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, opened the way toward more widespread recognition of the useful roles anthropologists could play outside academic settings when he got legislation passed that provided protections for Native Americans: land could no longer be taken away, lost land was supposed to be restored, tribal governments would be formed, and loans would be made available to reservations. Collier employed some anthropologists to aid in carrying out these policies. At about the same time, the Soil Conservation Service hired anthropologists to help with projects related to Native American land use.<sup>6</sup>

Events in the 1940s further boosted applied anthropology. In 1941, anthropologists founded the Society for Applied Anthropology and a new journal devoted to applied anthropology (it is now called Human Organization).7 During World War II, anthropologists were hired in unprecedented numbers by the U.S. government to help in the war effort. Margaret Mead estimated that something like 295 of the 303 anthropologists in the United States at the time were in one way or another direct participants in the war effort.<sup>8</sup>

The government hired anthropologists to help improve morale, to increase our understanding of enemies and allies, and to prepare for military campaigns and occupation of the islands of Micronesia and other areas in and around the Pacific.<sup>9</sup> For example, applied anthropologists were called on for advice when perplexed U.S. military officials wanted to understand why their Japanese enemies refused to behave like "normal" people. One of the practices that most distressed military leaders was the tendency of Japanese soldiers to try to kill themselves rather than be taken prisoner. Certainly, U.S. prisoners of war did not behave in this manner. Eventually, in order to understand the Japanese code of honor, the military hired anthropologists as consultants to the Foreign Morale Analysis Division of the War Office's Information Department.

After working with the anthropologists, the U.S. military learned that a major reason for the "strange" behavior of the Japanese prisoners was their belief that to surrender in a wartime situation, even in the face of greatly superior odds, or to be taken prisoner, even when injured and unconscious and therefore unable to avoid capture, was a disgrace. The Japanese believed further that the U.S. soldiers killed all prisoners. Thus, it is hardly surprising that so many captured Japanese soldiers preferred honorable death by their own hand. Once the U.S. military learned what the Japanese thought, they made efforts to explain to them that they would not be executed if captured, with the result that far more Japanese surrendered. Some prisoners even gave military information to the Americans—not to act against their own country, but rather to try and establish new lives for themselves, since the disgrace of being captured prevented them from resuming their former lives.<sup>10</sup>

Anthropologists were enthusiastic about helping the government during World War II because they were overwhelmingly committed to winning the war. The government, in its turn, seemed eager for anthropological advice. But in the postwar period there was an enormous increase in higher education as returning veterans and later baby boomers went to college, and U.S. anthropologists retreated from working with the government as academic opportunities opened up. At the same time anthropology became less concerned with applied problems and more concerned with theory and basic research.

The situation changed again, from the late 1970s on, as employment opportunities declined in colleges and universities. Today, a large and increasing number of anthropologists are finding employment outside of anthropology departments<sup>11</sup>—in medical schools, health centers, development agencies, urban planning agencies, and other public and private organizations that seek to change people's lives, in this society and others. Anthropologists who work in applied fields come out of a variety of subdisciplines. A major type of applied work is the "social impact" study required in connection with many programs funded by government or private agencies. Most people who do this work were trained in ethnology. But there are also applied anthropologists trained in physical anthropology; quite a few work in the area of medicine and public health. Archaeologists are hired to study, record, and preserve "cultural resources" that will be disturbed or destroyed by construction projects. And applied work in education often utilizes the skills of linguists.<sup>12</sup>

# Ethics of Applied Anthropology

There are always ethical issues that arise in the course of fieldwork, and anthropology as a profession has adopted certain principles of responsibility. Above all, an anthropologist's first responsibility is to those who are being studied—everything should be done to ensure that their welfare and dignity will be protected. Anthropologists also have a responsibility to those who will read about their research; research findings should be reported openly and truthfully.<sup>13</sup> But because applied anthropology often deals with planning and implementing changes in some target population, ethical responsibilities can become complicated. Perhaps the most important ethical question is this: Will the change truly benefit the target population?

In May 1946, the Society for Applied Anthropology established a committee to draw up a specific code of ethics for persons who work professionally as applied anthropologists. After many meetings and revisions, the society finally adopted a statement on ethical responsibilities in 1948. In 1983 the statement was revised again.<sup>14</sup> According to the code, the target community should be included as much as possible in the formulation of policy, so that people in the community may know in advance how the program may affect them. But perhaps the most important aspect of the code is the pledge not to recommend or take any action that is harmful to the interests of the community. The National Association of Practicing Anthropologists goes further: If the work the employer expects of the employee violates the ethical principles of the profession, the practicing anthropologist has the obligation to try to change those practices or, if change cannot be brought about, to withdraw from the work.<sup>15</sup>

# Difficulties in Evaluating the Effects of Planned Change

The decision as to whether a proposed change would benefit the target population is not always easy to make. In certain cases, as when improved medical care is involved, the benefits offered to the target group would seem to be unquestionable-we all feel sure that health is better than illness. But even this may not always be true. Consider a publichealth innovation such as inoculation against disease. Although it would undoubtedly have a beneficial effect on the survival rate of a population, a reduction in the mortality rate might have unforeseen consequences that would in turn produce new problems. Once the inoculation program was begun, the number of children surviving would probably increase. But it might not be possible to increase the rate of food production, given the level of technology, capital, and land resources possessed by the target population. Thus, the death rate, because of starvation, might rise to its previous level

A medical worker in rural Ethiopia vaccinates children. Medical care without a subsequent reduction in births can have harmful consequences because of growing population.

and perhaps even exceed it. The inoculation program would not affect the death rate; it might merely change the causes of death. This example shows that even if a program of planned change has beneficial consequences in the short run, a great deal of thought and investigation have to be given to its long-term effects.

One of the most important, and most difficult, problems for applied anthropology is the need to anticipate all the effects that are likely to result from the single change that is proposed. A good example of the unforeseen consequences of disease control comes from the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It was quite evident there that government efforts to control malaria after World War II had led to a disastrous population explosion: the population nearly doubled, unemployment rose, and the cost of government services became astronomical. In short, Mauritius had outstripped its ability to support itself. All these events were apparently triggered by DDT spraying in 1948, which eradicated the malaria-bearing mosquitoes. In one year, the death rate fell by 32 percent and the annual rate of increase in the population changed from less than half of 1 percent to 3 percent.<sup>16</sup>

A population's health can actually be harmed then when foreign health care is introduced without provision for related customs. Another example can be seen in a program attempted in a rural West African community. In that community, the women traditionally continued to work in the fields during pregnancy. In an attempt to improve prenatal care, program designers decided that pregnant women should be kept from their work. However, because the people who effected this change neglected to encourage the West African women to adopt a substitute program of proper physical activity, the women actually suffered increased chances of ill health and infant mortality.<sup>17</sup>

So, even if the short-term effects of planned changes are beneficial, the long-term effects may not be. Debra Picchi raised questions about the long-term effects on the Bakairi Indians of a program by the National Brazilian Indian Foundation (FUNAI) to produce rice with machine technology.<sup>18</sup> The Bakairi of the Mato Grosso region largely practice slash-and-burn horticulture in gallery forests along rivers, with supplementary cattle raising, fishing, and hunting. In the early part of the twentieth century their population had declined to 150 people and they were given a relatively small reserve. Some of it was gallery forest, but a larger part was parched and infertile (cerrado). When the Bakairi population began to increase, FUNAI introduced a scheme to plant rice on formerly unused cerrado land, using machinery, insecticides, and fertilizer. FUNAI paid the costs for the first year and expected that by the third year the scheme would be self-supporting. The project did not go so well because FUNAI did not deliver all the equipment needed and did not provide adequate advice. So only half the expected rice was produced. Still, it was more food than the Bakairi had previously, so the program should have been beneficial to them.

But there were negative side effects, not anticipated. Nutritionally, to be sure, the Bakairi are growing an additional starchy food. But use of the cerrado for agriculture reduces the area on which cattle can be grazed; cattle are an important source of high-quality protein. So the now-mechanized agriculture has reduced the availability of animal protein. The mechanization also makes the Bakairi more dependent on cash for fuel, insecticides, fertilizer, and repairs. But cash is hard to come by. Only some individuals can be hired—usually men with outside experience who have the required knowledge of machinery. So the cash earned in the new mechanized agriculture goes mainly to a relatively small number of people. It is debatable whether the new inequalities of income provide long-term effects that are beneficial to the Bakairi.

Thayer Scudder described the situation of Gwembe Tonga villagers who were relocated after a large dam was built in the Zambezi valley of central Africa. Economic conditions improved during the 1960s and early 1970s, as the people increasingly produced goods and services for sale. But then conditions deteriorated. By 1980 the villagers were in a miserable state: rates of mortality, alcohol drinking, theft, assault, and murder were all up. Why? One reason was that they had cut back on producing their own food in favor of producing for world markets. Such a strategy works well when world market prices are high; however, when prices fall, so does the standard of living.<sup>19</sup>

The situation described by Scudder illustrates the ethical dilemma for many applied anthropologists. As he said: "So how is it that I can still justify working for the agencies that fund such projects?" He pointed out that large-scale projects are almost impossible to stop. The anthropologist can choose to stand on the sidelines and complain or try to influence the project to benefit the target population as much as possible.<sup>20</sup>

## The Difficulties of Instituting Planned Change

Before an attempt can be made at cultural innovation, the innovators must determine whether the target population is aware of the benefits of the proposed change. Lack of awareness can be a temporary barrier to solving the problems at hand. For example, health workers have often had difficulty convincing people that they were becoming ill because something was wrong with their water supply. Many people do not believe that disease can be transmitted through an agent such as water. At other times, the target population is perfectly aware of the problem. A case in point is that of certain Taiwanese women who were introduced to family-planning methods beginning in the 1960s. The women knew they were having more children than they wanted or could easily afford, and they wanted to control their birth rate. They offered no resistance—they merely had to be given the proper devices and instructions and the birth rate fell quite quickly to a more desirable, and more manageable, level.<sup>21</sup>

Resistance by the Target Population. Not all proposed change programs are beneficial to the target population. Therefore resistance to innovation may be perfectly rational. In at least some known cases, the judgment of the target population has been better than that of the agents of change. One such example occurred during a Venezuelan governmentsponsored program to give infants powdered milk. The mothers rejected the milk, even though it was free, on the grounds that it implied that the mothers' milk was no good.<sup>22</sup> But who is to say that the resistance was not in fact intuitively smart, reflecting an awareness that such a milk program would not bene-

Breast-feeding is now known to be better for the health of a baby. In many countries, breast-feeding even in public is perfectably acceptable, as among the Huastec of Mexico. In the United States, the embarrassment of breast-feeding in public may discourage a switch to breast-feeding.

# EXPLORING WHY AN APPLIED PROJECT DIDN'T WORK

THE R. P. L.

When applied projects do not succeed, it is important for researchers to try to figure why. Part of the problem may be that the intended recipients' ideas about how things work may be very different from the researchers' ideas. Consider the following example. In Guatemala, village health-care workers were not only testing people for malaria but they were also offering free antimalarial drugs. Yet, surprisingly, a community survey found that only 20 percent of people with malaria symptoms took advantage of the free treatment. More surprisingly, most people with symptoms spent the equivalent of a day's wages to buy an injection that was not strong enough to be effective! Why? What was going on?

Finding the answer was not easy. First, researchers designed

interviews to elicit folk concepts about illness. What kinds of illnesses are there? What are their causes? What are their symptoms, and how are different illnesses to be treated? They conducted interviews with a random sample of households to check on what illnesses people had and what they did about them. Then they asked people to consider different hypothetical scenarios ("vignettes"), with different types of people and different degrees of severity of illness, to find out what treatment they would choose. All of these methods were well thought out, but the answers still did not predict what people actually did when they thought they had malaria. (The vignettes were not helpful because they were too abstract.) Finally, the researchers devised precise comparisons of the kinds of pills passed out by health-care workers and the pills and ampules (for injections) sold by the drugstore. They compared them two at a time, varying dosages and brands. People did think that more pills were more effective, as indeed they were. But they thought that the colorfully wrapped store-bought pill was more effective than the equivalent white unwrapped free pill, even though it was not. They also thought that one store-bought ampule used for injections (for which they would pay a day's wages) was more effective than four pills of any kind! But, in fact, one ampule was equivalent to only one pill.

Applied researchers often use such trial-and-error methods to find out how to get the information they need. Methods that work in one field setting don't al-

fit the children? Medical research suggests that mother's milk is far superior to powdered milk or formula. First, human milk best supplies the nutrients needed for human development. Second, it is now known that the mother, through her milk, is able to transmit antibodies (disease resistances) to the baby. And third, nursing delays ovulation and will usually increase the spacing between births.<sup>23</sup>

Not only is mother's milk now known to have so many advantages, but the switchover to powdered milk and formula in many underdeveloped areas has been nothing short of a disaster: the result has been increased malnutrition and misery. For one thing, powdered milk must be mixed with water, but if the water and the bottles are not sterilized, more sickness is introduced. Then too, if powdered

milk has to be purchased, mothers without cash are forced to dilute the milk to stretch it. And if a mother feeds her baby formula or powder for even a short time, the process is tragically irreversible, for her own milk dries up and she cannot return to breast-feeding even if she wants to.

As the Venezuelan example suggests, individuals may be able to resist proposed medical or health projects because acceptance is ultimately a personal matter. Large development projects planned by powerful governments or agencies rarely are stoppable, but even they can be resisted successfully. For example, the Kayapo of the Xingu River region of Brazil were recently able to cancel a plan by the Brazilian government to build dams along the river for hydroelectric power. The Kayapo

For example, the Guatemala project revealed why a particular program was not successful in a particular area. But how widespread are the interfering beliefs? Are they found throughout Guatemala? Do they interfere with the introduction of other medicines? Are we dealing with problems that exist in other areas of Central and South America? Although we don't yet have answers to these more extensive questions, anthropologists have developed efficient methods for assessing variation in beliefs within and between cultures.

We now know that if we ask one or two informants, we cannot assume that the answer is cultural, but that doesn't mean that we need to ask hundreds of people. If a belief is cultural and therefore commonly held, ten to twenty individuals asked the same question are quite sufficient to provide the researcher with a high probability that an answer is correct. (The agreement among respondents is called cultural consensus.) So, for example, Guatemalan respondents were in high agreement about which illnesses were contagious. But they disagreed a lot about whether a particular disease should be treated with a "hot" or a "cold" remedy. Using cultural-consensus methods, researchers can compare rural and urban residents, and they can also compare informants in different cultures. When we have more of these systematic comparisons, medical anthropologists and health practitioners may have a better understanding of how to implement medical care.

gained international attention when some of their leaders appeared on North American and European television and then successfully organized a protest in 1989 by members of several tribal groups. Their success seemed to come in part from their ability to present themselves to the international community as guardians of the rain forest-an image that resonated with international environmental organizations that supported their cause. Although it might seem to outsiders that the Kayapo want their way of life to remain as it was, the Kayapo are not opposed to all change. In fact, they want greater access to medical care, other government services, and manufactured goods from outside.<sup>24</sup>

But even if a project is beneficial to the target population, it may still meet with resistance. Factors that may hinder acceptance can be divided roughly into three categories: cultural barriers, social barriers, and *psychological* barriers. (These categories may sometimes overlap.)

Cultural barriers are shared behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs that tend to impede the acceptance of an innovation. For example, members of different societies may view gift giving in different ways. Particularly in commercialized societies, things received for nothing are often believed to be worthless. When the government of Colombia instituted a program of giving seedling orchard trees to farmers in order to increase fruit production, the farmers showed virtually no interest in the seedlings, many of which proceeded to die of neglect. When the government realized that the experiment had apparently failed, it began to charge each farmer a nominal fee for the seedlings. Soon the seedlings became immensely popular and fruit production increased.<sup>25</sup> The farmers' demand for the seedlings may have increased because they were charged a fee and therefore came to value the trees. The market demand for fruit may also have increased. Other examples of cultural resistance to change, which we discuss more fully later in this chapter, are beliefs about sex that make it difficult for people to follow medical guidelines for safer sex.

It is very important for agents of change to understand what the shared beliefs and attitudes are. First, indigenous cultural concepts or knowledge can sometimes be used effectively to enhance educational programs. For instance, in a program in Haiti to try to prevent child mortality from diarrhea, change agents used the terminology for traditional native herbal tea remedies (rafrechi, or cool refreshment) to identify the new oral rehydration therapy, which is a very successful medical treatment. In native belief diarrhea is a "hot" illness and appropriate remedies have to have cooling properties.<sup>26</sup> Second, even if indigenous beliefs are not helpful to the campaign, not paying attention to contrary beliefs can undermine the campaign. But uncovering contrary beliefs is not easy, particularly when they do not emerge in ordinary conversation (see the box titled "Exploring Why an Applied Project Didn't Work").

The acceptance of planned change may also depend on social factors. Research suggests that acceptance is more likely if the change agent and the target or potential adopter are similar socially. But change agents may have higher social status and more education than the people they are trying to influence. So change agents may work more with higher-status individuals because they are more likely to accept new ideas. If lower-status individuals also have to be reached, change agents of lower status may have to be employed.<sup>27</sup>

Finally, acceptance may depend on psychological factors—that is, how the individuals perceive both the innovation and the agents of change. In the course of trying to encourage women in the southeastern part of the United States to breast-feed rather than bottle-feed their infants, researchers discovered a number of reasons why women were reluctant to breast-feed their infants even though they heard it was healthier. Many women did not have confidence that they would produce enough milk for their babies, they were embarrassed about breast-feeding in public, and their family and friends had negative attitudes.<sup>28</sup> In designing an educational program, change agents may have to directly address such psychological concerns.

Discovering and Utilizing Local Channels of Influence. In planning a project involving cultural change, the administrator of the project should find out what the normal channels of influence are in the target population. In most communities, there are preestablished networks for communication, as well as persons of high prestige or influence who are looked to for guidance and direction. An understanding of such channels of influence is extremely valuable when one is deciding how to introduce a program of change into an area. In addition, it is useful to know at what times, and in what sorts of situations, one channel is likely to be more effective in spreading information and approval than another.

An example of the effective use of local channels of influence occurred when an epidemic of smallpox broke out in the Kalahandi district of the state of Orissa in India. The efforts of health workers to vaccinate villagers against the disease were consistently resisted. The villagers, naturally suspicious and fearful of these strange men with their equally strange medical equipment, were unwilling to offer themselves, and particularly their babies, to the peculiar experiments the strangers wished to perform. Afraid of the epidemic, the villagers appealed for help to their local priest, whose opinions on such matters they trusted. The priest went into a trance, explaining that the illness was the result of the goddess Thalerani's anger with the people. She could be appeased, he continued, only by massive feasts, offerings, and other demonstrations of the villagers' worship of her. Realizing that the priest was the village's major opinion leader, at least in medical matters, the frustrated health workers tried to get the priest to convince his people to undergo vaccination. At first, the priest refused to cooperate with the strange men, but when his favorite nephew fell ill, he decided to try any means available to cure the boy. He thereupon went into another trance, telling the villagers that the goddess wished all her worshipers to be vaccinated. Fortunately, the people agreed and the epidemic was largely controlled.<sup>29</sup>

If channels of influence are not stable, using influential persons in a campaign can sometimes backfire. In the educational campaign in Haiti to promote the use of oral rehydration therapy, which we referred to above, Mme. Duvalier, the first lady of Haiti at the time, lent her name to the project. Because there were no serious social or cultural barriers to the treatment and mothers reported that children took to the solutions well, success was expected. But in the middle of the campaign Haiti was embroiled in political turmoil and the first lady's husband was overthrown. Some of the public thought that the oral rehydration project was a plot by the Duvaliers to sterilize children, and this suspicion fueled resistance to the oral rehydration program.<sup>30</sup>

Applied anthropologists often advocate integrating indigenous healers into medical change programs. This idea may encounter considerable resistance by the medical profession and by government officials who view such healers negatively. But this strategy may be quite effective where indigenous healers are the only sources of health care in more isolated areas. If they are involved in medical change programs, indigenous healers are likely to refer patients to hospitals when they feel unable to cope with an illness, and the hospitals choose sometimes to refer patients to the healers.<sup>31</sup>

Other social groups and their attitudes can play important roles in shaping the outcome of the change program. Most often the people who are being helped have few privileges, little political and economic power, and low prestige.<sup>32</sup> Change or development is often regarded as a threat to those with more privilege. If those who do have power object to the new program, they may effectively sabotage it. The development agent, then, not only has to reckon with the local community but may also have to persuade more powerful groups in the society that the new program should be introduced.

# GLOBAL SOCIAL PROBLEMS: BASIC RESEARCH AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS

Some anthropologists as well as other social scientists think that it is time to attack the major social problems that afflict our world. The idea that we can solve social problems is based on two assumptions. We have to assume that it is possible to discover the causes of a problem. And we have to assume that we may be able to do something about the causes (once they are discovered) and thereby eliminate or reduce the problem.

Not everyone would agree with these assumptions. Some would say that our understanding of a social problem cannot ever be sufficient to suggest a solution guaranteed to work. To be sure, no understanding in science is perfect or certain; there is always some probability that even a well-supported explanation is wrong or incomplete. But the uncertainty of knowledge does not rule out the possibility of application. With regard to social problems, the possible payoff from even incomplete understanding could be a better and safer world. This possibility is what motivates many researchers who investigate social problems. After all, the history of the various sciences strongly supports the belief that scientific understanding can often allow humans to control nature, not just predict and explain it. Why should human behavior be any different?

So what do we know about some of the global social problems, and what policies or solutions are suggested by what we know?

### AIDS

Epidemics of disease have killed millions of people within short periods of time throughout recorded history. The Black Death (bubonic plague) killed between 25 and 50 percent of the population of Europe, perhaps 75 million people, during the fourteenth century; an epidemic during the sixth century killed an estimated 100 million people in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. Less noted in our history books, but also devastating, was the enormous depopulation that accompanied the expansion of Europeans into the New World and the Pacific from the 1500s on. Not only were people killed directly by European conquerors; millions also died from introduced diseases to which the natives had little or no resistance, diseases such as smallpox and measles that the Europeans brought with them but were no longer dying from.

The current state of medical science and technology may lull us into thinking that epidemics are a thing of the past. But the recent and sudden emergence of the disease we call AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) reminds us that new diseases, or new varieties of old diseases, can appear at any time. Like all other organisms, diseasecausing organisms also evolve. The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) that presumably cause AIDS emerged only recently. Viruses (and bacteria) are always mutating, and new strains emerge that are initially a plague on our genetic resistance and on medical efforts to contain them.

Millions of people all around the world already have the symptoms of AIDS, and millions more are infected with HIV but do not know they are infected. By the year 2000, according to World Health Organization estimates, about 40 million adults and children will be infected and 15 million people will have AIDS.<sup>33</sup> Many millions will have died of AIDS by then. AIDS is a frightening epidemic not only because of its likely toll. It is also frightening because it

Discrimination against people with AIDS will not alleviate the epidemic.

takes a long time (average four years) after exposure for symptoms to appear. This means that many people who have been infected by HIV, but do not know they are infected, may continue unknowingly to transmit the viruses to others.<sup>34</sup>

Transmission occurs mostly via sexual encounters, through semen and blood. Drug users may also transmit the HIV by way of contaminated needles. Transmission by blood transfusion has been virtually eliminated in this and other societies by medical screening of blood supplies. In many countries, however, there is still no routine screening of blood prior to transfusions.

Many people think of AIDS as only a medical problem that requires only a medical solution, without realizing that there are behavioral and cultural issues that need to be addressed as well. It is true that developing a vaccine (or a drug) to prevent people from getting AIDS, and developing a "cure" for those who have it, will finally solve the problem of AIDS. But, for a variety of reasons, we can expect that the medical solution alone will not be sufficient, at least not for a while. First, to be effective worldwide, or even within a country, a vaccine has to be inexpensive and relatively easy to produce in large quantities; the same is true of any medical treatment for victims. Second, governments around the world have to be willing and able to spend the money and hire the personnel necessary to manage an effective program.<sup>35</sup> Third, future vaccination and treatment will require the people at risk to be willing to get vaccinated and treated, which is not always easy to arrange. Witness the fact that measles is becoming more frequent in the United States because many people are not having their children vaccinated.

We do not know yet if an effective and inexpensive vaccine (or treatment) will be developed soon. In the meantime, the risk of HIV infection can be reduced only by changes in social (particularly sexual) behavior. But to persuade people to change their sexual behavior, it is necessary to find out exactly what they do sexually, and why they prefer what they do. The reasons for preferring some activity may make it difficult to change.

Research so far suggests that different sexual patterns are responsible for HIV transmission in different parts of the world. In the United States, England, northern Europe, Australia, and Latin America, the recipients of anal intercourse (particularly men) are the most likely individuals to acquire the HIV infection; vaginal intercourse can also transmit the infection (usually from the man to the woman). In Africa, however, the most common mode of transmission is vaginal intercourse, and so women get infected more commonly in Africa than elsewhere.<sup>36</sup> Is it reasonable to expect that people can generally be persuaded to stop doing what they prefer to do?

As of now, there are only two known ways to reduce the likelihood of sexual HIV transmission. One way is to abstain from sexual intercourse; the other is to use condoms. Educational programs that teach how AIDS spreads, and what you can do about it, may reduce the spread somewhat. But such programs may fail where people have incompatible beliefs and attitudes about sexuality. For example,

people in some central African societies believe that deposits of semen after conception are necessary for a successful pregnancy and generally enhance a woman's health and ability to reproduce. It might be expected then that people who have these beliefs about semen would choose not to use condoms; after all, condoms in their view are a threat to public health.<sup>37</sup> Educational programs may also emphasize the wrong message. Promiscuity may increase the risk of HIV transmission, so hardly anyone would question the wisdom of advertising to reduce the number of sexual partners. And, at least in the homosexual community in the United States, individuals report fewer sexual partners than in the past. What was not anticipated, however, was that individuals in monogamous relationships, who may feel safe, are less likely to use condoms or to avoid the riskiest sexual practices. Needless to say, sex with a regular partner who is infected is not safe!<sup>38</sup>

The stigma associated with AIDS also hinders efforts to reduce its spread. Possible victims may be unwilling to find out if they have been infected: the stigma, in this and some other societies, is that homosexual men are particularly likely to get infected.<sup>39</sup> Of course, not everyone who gets infected has engaged in homosexual behavior. Indeed, the majority of people now infected with AIDS in the world are heterosexual.<sup>40</sup> But the association with homosexuality, and the prejudice against homosexuals, may contribute to the spread of AIDS: some of those infected will continue to transmit the infection because they are afraid to find out that they might be infected. Much of the stigma associated with AIDS derives also from people's misinformation about exactly how AIDS is transmitted; indeed, many people fear any kind of contact with AIDS victims, as if any kind of contact could result in infection. Fear that they will be shunned if they are known to have AIDS may also contribute to some persons' unwillingness to be tested.

To solve the problem of AIDS, we may hope that medical science will develop an effective vaccination and a treatment that can be afforded by all. In the meantime, we can try to understand why people engage in certain risky sexual practices. Such understanding may allow us to design educational and other programs that would more successfully inhibit the spread of AIDS.

### Disasters

Disasters such as floods, droughts, earthquakes, and insect infestations are usually but not always beyond human control, but their effects are not.<sup>41</sup> Consider that between 1960 and 1980, forty-three disasters in Japan killed an average of sixty-three people per disaster. During the same period, seventeen disasters in Nicaragua killed an average of 6,235 people per disaster. In the United States, between 1960 and 1976, the average disaster killed just one person, injured a dozen, and destroyed fewer than five buildings. These comparative figures demonstrate that climatic and other events in the physical environment become disasters because of events or conditions in the social environment.

If people live in houses that are designed to withstand earthquakes—if governing bodies require such construction and the economy is developed enough so that people can afford such construction -the effects of an earthquake will be minimized. If poor people are forced to live in deforested flood plains in order to be able to find land to farm (as in coastal Bangladesh), if the poor (like those of Rio de Janeiro) are forced to live in shanties built on precarious hillsides, the floods and landslides that follow severe hurricanes and rainstorms can kill thousands and even hundreds of thousands.

Thus, disasters can have greater or lesser effects on human life, depending on social conditions. And therefore disasters are also social problems, problems that have social causes and possible social solutions. Legislating safe construction of a house is a social solution. The 1976 earthquake in Tangsham, China, killed 250,000 people, mostly because they lived in top-heavy adobe houses that could not stand severe shaking, whereas the 1989 earthquake in Loma Prieta, California, which was of comparable intensity, killed only sixty-five people.

One might think that floods, of all disasters, are the least influenced by social factors. After all, without a huge runoff from heavy rains or snow melt, there cannot be a flood. But consider why so many people have died from Yellow River floods in China. (One such flood, in 1931, killed nearly 4 million people, making it the deadliest single disaster in history.) The floods in the Yellow River basin have occurred mostly because the clearing of forests nearby (for fuel and farm land) has allowed enormous quantities of silt to wash into the river, raising the river bed and increasing the risk of floods that burst the dams that normally would contain them. The risk of disastrous flooding would be greatly reduced if different social conditions prevailed-if people were not so dependent on firewood for fuel, or they did not have to farm land close to the river, or the dams were higher and more numerous.

Famines, episodes of severe starvation and death, often are triggered by physical events such as a hurricane that knocks down and uproots food trees and plants. But famines do not inevitably follow such an event. Social conditions can prevent a famine or increase the likelihood of one. Consider what is likely to happen in Samoa after a hurricane.<sup>42</sup> Whole villages that have lost their coconut and breadfruit trees, as well as their taro patches, pick up and move for a period of time to other villages where there are relatives and friends. The visitors stay and are fed until some of their cultivated trees and plants start to bear food again, at which point they return home. This kind of intervillage reciprocity probably could occur only in a society that has relatively little inequality in wealth. Nowadays, the central government may also help out by providing food and other supplies.

Relief provided by a central government may not always get to those who need it the most. In India, for example, the central government provides help in time of drought to minimize the risk of famine. But the food and other supplies provided to a village may end up being unequally distributed, following the rules of social and gender stratification. Members of the local elite arrange to function as distributors and find ways to manipulate the relief efforts to their advantage. Lower-class and lower-caste families still suffer the most. Within the family, biases against females (particularly young girls and elderly women) translate into their getting less food. It is no wonder then that in times of food shortage and famine, the poor and other socially disadvantaged persons are especially likely to die.<sup>43</sup>

Thus, the people of a society may not all be equally at risk in case of disaster. In socially stratified societies, the poor particularly suffer. It is they who are likely to be forced to overcultivate, overgraze, and deforest their land, making it more susceptible to degradation. A society most helps those it values the most.

People in the past, and even recently in some places, viewed disasters as divine retribution for human immorality. For example, the great Flood described in the Old Testament was understood to be God's doing. But scientific research increasingly allows us to understand the natural causes of disasters, and particularly the social conditions that magnify or minimize their effects. To reduce the impact of disasters, then, we need to reduce the social conditions that magnify their effects. If humans are responsible for those social conditions, humans can change them. If earthquakes destroy houses that are too flimsy, we can build stronger houses. If floods caused by overcultivation and overgrazing kill defenseless people directly (or indirectly by stripping their soils), we can decide to grow new forest cover and provide new job opportunites to flood plain farmers. In short, we may not be able to do much about the weather (or other physical causes of disasters), but we can do a lot (if we want to) about the social factors that make disasters disastrous.

# Inadequate Housing and Homelessness

In most nations of the world today, the poor typically live in inadequate housing, in areas we call slums. In many of the developing nations of the world, where cities are growing very rapidly, squatter settlements emerge as people build dwellings (often makeshift) that are typically declared illegal, either because the land is illegally occupied or because the dwellings violate building codes. Squatter settlements are often located in degraded environments that are subject to flooding and mudslides or have inadequate or polluted water. The magnitude of the problem is made clear in some recent statistics: some 40 percent of the population in Nairobi, Kenya, live in unauthorized housing, and 67 percent of the people in five of El Salvador's major cities are living in "illegal" dwellings.<sup>44</sup>

But contrary to what some people have assumed, not all the dwellers in illegal settlements are poor; all but the upper-income elite may be found in such settlements.<sup>45</sup> Moreover, although squatter settlements have problems, they are not chaotic and unorganized places, full of crime. Most of the dwellers are employed, aspire to get ahead, live in nuclear families, and give each other aid.<sup>46</sup> People live in such settlements because they cannot find affordable housing and they house themselves as best they can. Many researchers think that such self-help tendencies should be assisted to improve housing, because governments in developing countries can seldom afford costly public housing projects. But they could invest somewhat in infrastructure (sewers, water supplies, roads) and provide construction materials to those who are willing to do the work required to improve their dwellings.<sup>47</sup>

Housing in slum areas or "shantytowns" does provide shelter, minimal though it may be. But many people in many areas of the world have no homes at all. Even in countries such as the United States, which are affluent by world standards, large numbers of people are homeless. They sleep in parks, over steam vents, in doorways, subways, and cardboard boxes. In 1987 it was estimated that there were more than 1 million homeless people in the

![](_page_15_Picture_0.jpeg)

Homelessness has increased dramatically in the United States recently. In many places, as in New York City, if the homeless have any shelter it is a cardboard box or a makeshift shelter like the one shown here.

United States.<sup>48</sup> And their numbers are growing. A 1988 congressionally funded study suggested that unless immediate action is taken in the United States to provide affordable housing, there may be as many as 19 million homeless people by the end of this century.49

Who are the homeless, and how did they get to be homeless? As yet we have relatively little research on these questions, but what we do have suggests differences in the causes of homelessness in different parts of the world.

In the United States, unemployment and the shortage of decent low-cost housing appear to be at least partly responsible for the large number of homeless persons.<sup>50</sup> But there is also another factor: the deliberate policy to reduce the number of people hospitalized for mental illness and other disabilities. For example, from the mid-1960s to mid-1990s New York State released thousands of patients from mental hospitals. Many of these ex-patients had to live in cheap hotels or poorly monitored facilities with virtually no support network. With very little income, they found it especially hard to cope with their circumstances. Ellen Baxter and Kim Hopper, who studied the homeless in New York City, suggest that one event is rarely sufficient to render a person homeless. Rather, poverty and disability (mental or

physical) seem to lead to one calamity after another, and finally homelessness.<sup>51</sup>

Many people cannot understand why homeless individuals do not want to go to municipal shelters. But observations and interviews with the homeless suggest that violence pervades the municipal shelters, particularly the men's shelters. Many feel safer on the streets. Some private charities provide safe shelters and a caring environment. These shelters are filled, but the number of homeless that could be accommodated in them is small.<sup>52</sup> Even single-room-occupancy hotels are hardly better. Many of them are infested with vermin, the common bathrooms are filthy, and they, like the shelters, often are dangerous.<sup>53</sup>

Some poor individuals in a society may be socially isolated; they may have few or no friends and relatives and little or no social contact. (These people may or may not have symptoms of severe mental illness.) But a society with many such individuals does not necessarily have much homelessness. Socially isolated individuals, even mentally ill individuals, could still have housing, or so the experience of Melbourne, Australia, suggests. Universal health insurance pays for health care as well as the visits of medical practitioners to isolated and ill individuals, wherever they live. Disabled individuals receive a pension or sickness benefits sufficient to allow them to live in a room or apartment. And there is still a considerable supply of cheap housing in Melbourne.

Research in Melbourne suggests that a severe mental disorder often precedes living in marginal accommodations-city shelters, commercial shelters, and cheap single rooms. About 50 percent of the individuals living in such places were diagnosed as previously having some form of mental illness; this percentage is similar to what seems to be the case for homeless people and people living in marginal accommodations in the United States.

The contrast between the United States and Australia makes it clear that homelessness is caused by social and political policies. Individuals with similar characteristics live in both Australia and the United States, but in the United States a large percentage of them are homeless.<sup>54</sup>

Because homelessness cannot occur if everybody can afford housing, some people would say that homelessness can occur only in a society with great extremes in income. Recent statistics on income distribution in the United States clearly show that since the 1970s the rich have gotten much richer and the poor have gotten much poorer. The United States now has more income inequality than other industrialized countries, such as Japan and the Netherlands. In fact, the profile of inequality in the United States more closely resembles that of developing countries such as India and Mexico.<sup>55</sup>

In the United States and many other countries, most homeless persons are adults. Whereas adults are "allowed" to be homeless, public sensibilities in the United States appear to be outraged by the sight of children living in the streets; when authorities discover homeless children, they try to find shelters or foster homes for them. But many countries in the world have many "street children." It has been estimated that 80 million of the world's children live in the streets. Forty million of them live in Latin America, 20 million in Asia, 10 million in Africa and the Middle East, and 10 million elsewhere.<sup>56</sup>

Lewis Aptekar, who studied street children in Cali, Colombia, reported some surprises.<sup>57</sup> Whereas many of the homeless in the United States and Australia are mentally disabled, the street children in Cali (ranging in age from seven to sixteen) are mostly free of mental problems; by and large they also test normally on intelligence tests. In addition, even though many street children come from abusive homes or never had homes, they usually seem happy and enjoy the support and friendship of other street children. They cleverly and creatively look for ways to get money, frequently through entertaining passersby.

Although the observer might think that the street children must have been abandoned by their families, in actuality most of them have at least one parent they keep in touch with. Street life begins slowly, not abruptly; children usually do not stay on the streets full-time until they are about thirteen.

Though street children in Cali seem to be in better physical and mental shape than their siblings who stay at home, they often are viewed as a "plague." The street children come from poor families and cope with their lives as best they can, so why are they not viewed with pity and compassion? Aptekar suggests that well-off families see the street children as a threat because a life independent of family may appeal to children (even from welloff families) who wish to be free of parental constraint and authority.

Whether people become homeless, whether there are shantytowns, seems to depend on a society's willingness to share wealth and help those in need. The street children of Cali may remind us that children as well as adults need companionship as well as caring. Caring for physical needs without responding to emotional needs may get people off the streets, but it won't get them a "home."

# Family Violence and Abuse

In our society, we hear regularly about the abuse of spouses and children. It appears to be increasing, but is it? This seems to be a simple question, but it is not so simple to answer. We have to decide what we mean by abuse.

Is physical punishment of a child who does something wrong child abuse? Not so long ago, teachers in public schools in the United States were allowed to discipline children by hitting them with rulers or paddles, and many parents used switches or belts. Some people today might consider these practices to be child abuse, but were they abusive when they were generally accepted? Some would argue that abuse is going beyond what a culture considers appropriate behavior. Others would disagree and would focus on the violence and severity of parents' or teachers' behavior, not the cultural judgment of appropriateness. And abuse need not involve physical violence. It could be argued that verbal aggression and neglect may be just as harmful as physical aggression. Neglect presents its own problems of definition. People from other cultures might argue that we act abusively when we put an infant or child alone in a room to

![](_page_17_Picture_0.jpeg)

*Help for mothers is an important predictor of less physical punishment of children. Among the Navaho,* matrilocal extended families have many individuals to help bring up a child.

sleep.<sup>58</sup> Few would disagree about severe injuries that kill a child or spouse or require medical treatment; but other disciplinary behaviors are more difficult to judge.

To avoid having to decide what is or is not abuse, many researchers focus their studies on variation in the frequencies of specific behaviors. For example, one can ask which societies have physical punishment of children without calling physical punishment abusive.

More child abuse cases are reported today in the United States than a decade ago, but that does not necessarily mean that violence against children has increased; it may mean only that our awareness and intolerance of violence against children have increased. In fact, in a national interview survey of physical familial violence in the United States, most types of physical violence decreased in frequency between 1975 and 1985. That is, people talked about fewer family homicides, fewer severe assaults on husbands and wives, and fewer severe assaults on children. Despite these declines, however, the United States remains a society with a generally high rate of physical violence in families. In the year 1985 alone, one out of six couples had a violent assault episode and one out of ten children was severely assaulted by a parent. The risk of assault by a family member in the United States is much greater than the risk of assault by a stranger; for women it is more than 200 times as great.<sup>59</sup> In a comparison of twenty-seven nations, the United States had the third highest rate of child murder.<sup>60</sup>

Cross-culturally, if one form of family violence occurs, others are also likely. So, for example, wife beating, husband beating, child punishment, and fighting among siblings are all significantly associated with each other. But the relationships between these types of family violence are not that strong, which means that they cannot be treated together as different facets of the same phenomenon; indeed, somewhat different factors seem to explain different forms of family violence.<sup>61</sup> We focus here on two forms of violence that are most prevalent cross-culturally-violence against children and violence against wives.

*Violence against Children.* Cross-culturally, many societies practice and allow infanticide. Frequent reasons for infanticide include illegitimacy, deformity of the infant, twins, too many children, or that the infant is unwanted. Infanticide is usually performed by the mother, but this does not mean that she is uncaring; it may mean that she cannot adequately feed or care for the infant or that it has a poor chance to survive. The reasons for infanticide are quite similar to those given for abortion. Therefore, it seems that infanticide may be performed when abortion does not work or when unexpected qualities of the infant (for example, deformity) force the mother to reevaluate her ability to raise the child.<sup>62</sup>

Physical punishment of children occurs in over 70 percent of the world's societies. But the fact that children are sometimes punished physically in most societies does not mean that most societies use physical punishment regularly.<sup>63</sup> Why is physical punishment used in some societies and not others? Some studies suggest that physical punishment is more likely whenever the mother is virtually the only caretaker for the child. Physical punishment is unlikely to be used when there are other caretakers, who may relieve the mother of some of the stresses associated with child care.<sup>64</sup> In addition, societies that are more complex economically and politically tend to rely much more on physical punishment than simpler societies. Why this is so is not yet clear. One suggestion is that complex societies are hierarchical and tend to insist on complying with orders; they may use physical punishment in child rearing to ensure that children learn to comply.<sup>65</sup>

Violence Against Wives. In the United States, wives and husbands are equally likely to assault the other. Wife battering in the United States is considered a more serious social problem because wives are much more likely to be seriously injured than husbands.<sup>66</sup> Cross-culturally, wife beating is the most common form of family violence; it occurs at least occasionally in about 85 percent of the world's societies. In about half the societies, wife beating is sometimes serious enough to cause permanent injury or death.<sup>67</sup>

It is often assumed that wife beating will be common in societies in which males control economic and political resources. In a cross-cultural test of this assumption, David Levinson found that not all indicators of male dominance predict wife beating, but many do. Specifically, wife beating is most common when men control the products of family labor, when men have the final say in decision making in the home, when divorce is difficult for women, when remarriage for a widow is controlled by the husband's kin, and when women do not have any female work groups.<sup>68</sup> Similarly, in the United States, the more one spouse in the family makes the decisions and has the power, the more physical violence occurs in the family (wife beating is even more likely when the husband controls the household and is out of work).<sup>69</sup>

Wife beating appears to be related to broader patterns of violence in adulthood. Societies that have violent methods of conflict resolution within communities, physical punishment of criminals, high frequencies of warfare, and cruelty toward enemies generally have more wife beating.<sup>70</sup>

*Reducing the Risk.* What can be done to minimize family violence? First, we have to recognize that probably nothing can be done as long as people in a society do not acknowledge that there is a problem. If severe child punishment and wife beating are considered perfectly acceptable by almost everyone in a society, they are unlikely to be considered social problems that need solutions. In our own society many programs are designed to take abused children or wives away from the family situation or to punish the abuser. (Of course, in these situations the violence has already occurred and was serious enough to have been noticed.) Cross-culturally, at least with respect to wife beating, intervention by others seems to be successful only if they intervene before violence gets serious. As one would expect, however, those societies most prone to a high rate of wife beating are the least likely to practice immediate intervention. More helpful perhaps, but admittedly harder to arrange, is the promotion of conditions of life that are associated with low family violence. Research so far suggests that promoting the equality of men and women and the sharing of child-rearing responsibilities may go a long way toward lessening incidents of family violence.71

### Crime

What is a crime in one society is not necessarily a crime in another. Just as it is difficult to decide what constitutes abuse, it is difficult to define crime. In one society, it may be a crime to walk over someone's land without permission; in another, there might not be any concept of personal ownership, and therefore no concept of trespassing. In seeking to understand variation in crime, it is not surprising that many researchers have preferred to compare those behaviors that are more or less universally considered crimes and that are reliably reported. For example, in a large-scale comparison of crime in 110 nations over a span of 70 years, Dane Archer and Rosemary Gartner concentrated on homicide rates. They argued that homicide is harder for the public to hide and for officials to ignore than are other crimes. A comparison of interviews about crime with police records suggests that homicide is the most reliably reported crime in official records.72

Nations not only have very different crime rates when we compare them at a given point in time; the rates also vary over time within a nation. In the last 600 years, homicide rates have generally declined in Western societies. In England, where homicide rates have been well documented for centuries, the chance of murder during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries was ten times higher than in England today. But beginning in the 1960s, homicide and other crime rates have surged upward in many Western countries.<sup>73</sup> Some of the lowest homicide rates around 1970 (the date for which we have some indicator for many nations) were found in Iran, Dahomey, Puerto Rico, New Zealand, Norway, England, and France. Some of the highest homicide rates were found in Iraq, Colombia, Myanmar (formerly Burma), Thailand, Swaziland, and Uganda. Compared with other countries, the United States had a fairly high homicide rate; approximately three-fourths of the countries surveyed had lower homicide rates than the United States.74 That was in the 1970s. Now the United States has an even higher rate.

One of the clearest findings to emerge from comparative studies of crime is that war is associated with higher rates of homicide. Archer and Gartner compared changes in homicide rates of nations before and after major wars. Whether a nation is defeated or victorious, homicide rates tend to increase after a war. This result is consistent with the idea that a society or nation legitimizes violence during wartime. During wartime societies approve of killing the enemy; afterward, homicide rates may go up because inhibitions against killing have been relaxed.75

Ted Gurr suggested that the long-term downtrend in crime in Western societies seems to be consistent with an increasing emphasis on humanistic values and nonviolent achievement of goals. But such goals may be temporarily suspended during wartime. In the United States, for example, surges in violent crime rates occurred during the 1860s and 1870s (during and after the Civil War), after World War I, after World War II, and during the Vietnam War.76

In the types of societies that anthropologists typically study, homicide statistics are not usually available; so cross-cultural studies of homicide usually measure homicide rates by comparing and rank ordering ethnographers' statements about the frequency of homicide. For example, the statement that murder is "practically unheard of" is taken to mean that the murder rate is lower than where it is reported that "homicide is not uncommon." Despite the fact that the data on cultural homicide rates are not quantitative, the cross-cultural results are consistent with the cross-national results; more war is usually associated with more homicide and assault, as well as with socially approved aggressive behaviors (as in aggressive games) and severe physical punishment for wrongdoing.<sup>77</sup> Our own recent cross-cultural study suggests that the more war a society has, the more socialization or training of aggression (in boys) it will have, and such socialization strongly predicts homicide and assault.78

Capital punishment (execution of criminals) is severe physical punishment for wrongdoing. It is commonly thought that would-be murderers are deterred by the prospect of capital punishment. Yet recent cross-national research suggests otherwise. Instead of increasing after capital punishment is abolished, murder rates go down.<sup>79</sup> Why? Perhaps capital punishment, which is homicide committed by society, legitimizes violence just as war seems to do.

Research conducted in the United States suggests that juvenile delinquents (usually boys) are likely to come from broken homes, with the father absent for much of the time the boy is growing up. The conclusion often drawn is that father absence somehow increases the likelihood of delinquency and adult forms of physical violence. But other conditions that may cause delinquency are also associated with broken homes, conditions such as the stigma of not having a "regular" family and the generally low standard of living of such families. It is therefore important to conduct research in other societies, in which father absence does not occur in concert with these other factors, to see if father absence by itself is related to physical violence.

For example, in many polygynous societies, children grow up in a mother-child household; the father lives separately and is hardly ever around the child. Does the fatherabsence explanation of delinquency and violence fit such societies? The answer is apparently yes: societies in which children are reared in motherchild households or the father spends little time in child care tend to have more physical violence by males than do societies in which fathers spend time with children.<sup>80</sup>

More research is needed to discover exactly what accounts for this relationship. It is possible, as some suggest, that boys growing up without fathers are apt to act "super-masculine" to show how "male" they are. But it is also possible that mothers who rear children alone often use physical punishment, and therefore are likely to provide an aggressive role model for the child. In addition, high male mortality in war predicts polygyny (as we saw in the chapter on marriage and the family); therefore boys in polygynous societies are likely to be exposed to a warrior tradition.<sup>81</sup>

Trying to act super-masculine, however, may be likely to involve violence only if aggression is an important component of the male gender role in society. If men were expected by society to be sensitive, caring, and nonviolent, boys who grew up without fathers might try to be super-sensitive and super-caring. So society's expectations for males probably shape how growing up in a mother-child household affects behavior in adolescence and later.<sup>82</sup>

One widely held idea is that poor economic conditions increase the likelihood of crime. But the relationship does not appear to be strong. And the findings are somewhat different for different types of crime. For example, hundreds of studies in this and other countries do not show a clear relationship between changes in economic well-being as measured by unemployment rates and changes in violent crime as measured by homicide. Homicide does not appear to increase in bad times. Property crimes, however, do increase with increases in unemployment. Violent crime does appear to be associated with one economic characteristic—homicide is usually highest in nations with high income inequality. Why income inequality predicts homicide, but downturns in the economy do not, is something of a puzzle.<sup>83</sup>

The fact that property crime is linked to unemployment is consistent with the cross-cultural finding that theft (but not violent crime) tends to occur less often in egalitarian societies than in stratified ones. Societies with equal access to resources usually have distribution mechanisms that offset any differences in wealth. Hence theft should be less of a temptation, and therefore less likely, in an egalitarian society. Theft rates are higher in socially stratified societies despite the fact that they are more likely than egalitarian societies to have police and courts to punish crime. Societies may try to deter property and other crimes when the rates of such are high, but we do not know that these efforts actually reduce the rates.

So what does the available research suggest about how we might be able to reduce crime? The results so far indicate that homicide rates are highest in societies that socialize their boys for aggression. Such socialization is linked to war and other forms of socially approved violence (capital punishment, television and movie violence by heroes, violence in sports). And the statistical evidence suggests that war is a cause of socialization for aggression, which in turn is a cause of high rates of violence. The policy implication of these results is that if we can reduce socialization for aggression (by reducing the risk of war and therefore the necessity to produce effective warriors), and if we can reduce other forms of socially approved violence, we may thereby reduce rates of violent crime. The reduction of inequalities in wealth may also help to reduce crime, particularly theft. And although it is not yet clear

A society may encourage boys to play soldier, perhaps to prepare them to be courageous in combat later on. Crossculturally, socialization for aggression strongly predicts homicide and assault.

why, it appears that raising boys with a male role model around may reduce the likelihood of male violence in adulthood.

### War

War is an unfortunate fact of life in most societies known to anthropology, judging by the cross-cultural research we referred to in the chapter on political life. Almost every society had at least occasional wars when it was first described, unless it had been pacified (usually by Western colonial powers).<sup>84</sup> Since the Civil War, the United States has not had any wars on its territory, but it is unusual in that respect. Most societies (before pacification) had frequent armed combat between communities or larger units that usually spoke the same language. That is, most warfare was internal to the society or language group. (Even some wars in modern times involved speakers of the same language; recall the wars between Italian states before the unification of Italy and many of the "civil" wars of the last two centuries.) Although people in some societies might fight against people in other societies, such "external" wars were usually not organized on behalf of the entire society or even a major section of it.<sup>85</sup> That is, warfare in the ethnographic record did not usually involve politically unified societies. Finally, the absolute numbers of people killed may have been small, but this does not mean that the warfare in nonindustrial societies was a trivial matter. Indeed, it appears that nonindustrial warfare may have been even more lethal proportionately than modern warfare, judging by the fact that wars killed 25 to 30 percent of the males in some nonindustrial societies.<sup>86</sup>

In the chapter on political life, we discussed the possibility that people in nonindustrial societies go to war mostly out of fear-particularly a fear of expectable but unpredictable natural disasters (droughts, floods, hurricanes, among others) that destroy food supplies. People with more of a history of such disasters have more war. It looks as if they go to war to protect themselves ahead of time from disasters, inasmuch as the victors in war almost always take resources (land, animals, other things) from the defeated, even when the victors have no current resource problems. Another factor apparently making for more war is teaching children to mistrust others. People who grow up to be mistrustful of others may be more likely to go to war than to negotiate or seek conciliation with "enemies." Mistrust or fear of others seems to be partially caused by threat or fear of disasters.<sup>87</sup>

Is warfare in and between modern state societies explainable in much the same way that nonindustrial warfare seems to be explainable? If the answer to that question turns out to be yes, it will certainly be a modified yes, because the realities of industrialized societies require an expanded conception of disasters. In the modern world, with its complex economic and political dependencies among nations, we may not be worried only about weather or pest disasters that could curtail food supplies; possible curtailments of other resources-particularly oil-may also scare us into going to war. According to some commentators, the decision to go to war against Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1991 fits that theory of war.

But even if the "threat-to-resources" theory is true, we may be coming to realize (with the end of the Cold War) that war is not the only way to ensure access to resources. There may be a better way in the modern world, a way that is more cost-effective as well as more preserving of human life.

If it is true that war is most likely when people fear unpredictable disasters of any kind, the risk of war should lessen when people realize that the harmful effects of disasters could be reduced or prevented by international cooperation. Just as we have the assurance of disaster relief within our country, we could have the assurance of disaster relief worldwide. That is, the fear of unpredictable disasters and the fear of others (and the consequent risk of war) could be reduced by the assurance ahead of time that the world would help those in need in case of disaster. Instead of going to war out of fear, we could go to peace by agreeing to share more. The certainty of international cooperation could compensate for the uncertainty of resources.

Consider how Germany and Japan have fared in the half century since their "unconditional surrender" in World War II. They were forbidden to participate in the international arms race and could rely on others (particularly the United States) to protect them. Without a huge burden of armaments, Germany and Japan thrived. But countries that competed militarily, particularly the United States and the Soviet Union, declined economically. Doesn't that scenario at least suggest the wisdom of international cooperation, particularly the need for international agreements to assure worldwide disaster relief? Compared with going to war and its enormous costs, going to peace would be a bargain!

Recent research in political science and anthropology suggests an additional way to reduce the risk of war in the world. Studies indicate that people in more participatory (more "democratic") political

systems rarely go to war with each other, in the ethnographic record just as among modern nationstates.<sup>88</sup> Thus, if authoritarian governments were to disappear from the world, because the powerful nations of the world stopped supporting them militarily and otherwise, the world could be more peaceful for this reason too.

Although democratically governed states rarely go to war with each other, they are not necessarily more peaceful in general. On the contrary, they are as likely to go to war as other kinds of political systems, but not so much with each other. (The United States has gone to war recently with Grenada, Panama, and Iraq—all authoritarian states—but not with democratic Canada, with which the United States has also had disputes.) The theory suggested by the cross-national and cross-cultural results is that democratic conflict-resolution within a political system generalizes to democratic conflict-resolution between political systems (if the systems are both democratic). If our participatory institutions and perceptions allow us to resolve our disputes peacefully, internally and externally, we may think that similarly governed people would also be disposed to settle things peacefully. Therefore, disputes between participatory political systems should be unlikely to result in war.

The understanding that participatory systems rarely fight each other, and knowing why they do not, would have important consequences for policy in the contemporary world. The kinds of military preparations believed necessary and the costs people would be willing to pay for them might be affected. On the one hand, understanding the relationship beween democracy and peace might encourage war making against authoritarian regimes to overturn them—with enormous costs in human life and otherwise. On the other hand, understanding the consequences of democracy might encourage us to assist the emergence and consolidation of more participatory systems of government in the countries of eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and elsewhere. In any case, the relationship between democracy and peace strongly suggests that it is counterproductive to support any undemocratic regimes, even if they happen to be enemies of our enemies, if we want to minimize the risk of war in the world.

It may be realistic, not just idealistic, to think that the more people understand the peaceful effect of democracy, and the more they are assured of worldwide disaster relief, the more they might go to peace!

# MAKING THE WORLD BETTER

There are many social problems afflicting our world, not just the ones discussed in this chapter. We don't have the space to discuss the international trade in drugs and how it plays out in violence, death, and corruption. We haven't discussed the negative effects of environmental degradation (water and air pollution, global warming, ozone depletion, destruction of forests and wetlands). We haven't said anything about overpopulation, the energy crisis, and a host of other problems we should care and do something about, if we hope to make this a better world. What we have tried to do in this chapter is encourage positive thinking by suggesting how the results of scientific research could be applied to solving social problems.

We may know enough now that we can do something about our problems. And we will discover more on the basis of future research. Social problems are mostly of human making. Therefore they are susceptible to human unmaking. There may be difficulties, but we can overcome them if we want to.

# **V** SUMMARY

1. We may be more motivated now to try to solve social problems because worldwide communication has increased our awareness of them elsewhere, because we seem to be increasingly bothered by problems in our own society, and because we know more than we used to about various social problems that afflict our world.

2. Applied anthropology in the United States developed out of anthropologists' personal experiences with disadvantaged peoples. Applied, or practicing, anthropologists may be involved in one or more phases of a program that is designed to change peoples' lives: assembling relevant knowledge, constructing alternative plans, assessing the likely social and environmental impact of particular plans, implementing the program, and monitoring the program and its effects.

3. Today many anthropologists are finding employment outside of anthropology departments-in medical schools, health centers, development agencies, urban-planning agencies, and other public and private organizations, in this society and others.

4. The code of ethics for those who work professionally as applied anthropologists specifies that the target population should be included as much as possible in the formulation of policy, so that people in the community may know in advance how the program may affect them. But perhaps the most important aspect of the code is the pledge not to be involved in any plan whose effect will not be beneficial. It is often difficult to evaluate the effects of planned changes. Long-term consequences may be detrimental even if the changes are beneficial in the short run.

5. Even if a planned change will prove beneficial to its target population, the people may not accept it. And if the proposed innovation is not utilized by the intended target, the project cannot be considered a success. Target populations may reject or resist a proposed innovation for various reasons: because they are unaware of the need for the change; because they misinterpret the symbols used to explain the change or fail to understand its real purpose; because their customs and institutions conflict with the change; or because they are afraid of it. The target population may also resist the proposed change because they unconsciously or consciously know it is not good for them.

6. To be effective, change agents may have to discover and use the traditional channels of influence in introducing their projects to the target population.

7. The idea that we can solve global social problems is based on two assumptions. We have to

assume that it is possible to discover the causes of a problem. And we have to assume that we will be able to do something about the causes (once they are discovered) and thereby eliminate or reduce the problem.

8. Until medical science develops an effective and inexpensive vaccine (or treatment) for AIDS, the risk of infection can be reduced only by changes in social (particularly sexual) behavior.

9. Disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and droughts can have greater or lesser effects on human life, depending on social conditions. Therefore disasters are partly social problems, with partly social causes and solutions.

10. Whether people become homeless, whether there are shantytowns, seems to depend on a society's willingness to share wealth and help those in need.

11. Promoting the equality of men and women and the sharing of child-rearing responsibilities may reduce family violence.

12. We may be able to reduce rates of violent crime if we can reduce socialization and training for aggression. To do that we would have to reduce the likelihood of war (the high likelihood of which predicts more socialization for aggression) and other forms of socially approved aggression. The reduction of inequalities in wealth may also help to reduce crime, particularly theft. And raising boys with a male role model around may reduce the likelihood of male violence in adulthood.

13. People seem to be most likely to go to war when they fear unpredictable disasters that destroy food supplies or curtail the supplies of other necessities. Disputes between more participatory (more "democratic") political systems are unlikely to result in war. Therefore, the more democracy spreads in the world, and the more people all over the world are assured of internationally organized disaster relief, the more they might go to peace rather than to war to solve their problems.
