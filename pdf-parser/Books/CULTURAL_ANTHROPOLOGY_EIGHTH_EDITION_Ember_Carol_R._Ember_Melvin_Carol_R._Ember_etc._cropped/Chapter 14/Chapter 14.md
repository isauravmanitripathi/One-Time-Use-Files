# Psychology and Culture

Visitors to another society often come to feel that the people there think differently, or have different reactions to situations, that they seem to have different **personalities** (distinctive ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving) compared with people back home. Stereotypes are born from these casual observations: certain peoples are thought to be reserved, others authoritarian, still others hot-tempered. Although anthropologists generally reject such stereotypes because they are often based on hasty, even ethnocentric judgments, they do not reject the idea that there may be differences from society to society in the frequencies of some aspects of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Individuals may be frequently reserved in some societies, for example.

Consider the contrast in feelings and behavior between the Semai of central Malaya and the Yanomamö of the Brazil-Venezuela border-a contrast that clearly expresses differences in personality. The Semai are famous in Malaya for their timidity and have never been described as hostile or surly. When asked about anger, the Semai say, "We do not get angry."1 The Yanomamö, on the other hand, are famous for their fierceness. They not only have chronic warfare between villages, but frequently show aggression within a village. Shouting and threatening to obtain demands are frequent, as are wife beating and bloody fights with clubs. Men are proud of their scars and sometimes shave their heads to display them.<sup>2</sup>

Even though there may be psychological differences between societies, there also are psychological similarities. After all, we are all human. People the world over cry or weep when a loved one dies, laugh or smile when something good happens, learn from mistakes, and have many of the same needs. Anthropologists who are interested in psychological differences between and within societies and in psychological similarities across the broad range of human societies call themselves psychological anthropologists. (Psychologists who study people in two or more societies call themselves cross-cultural psychologists.) Four main questions seem to characterize psychological anthropology: To what extent do all human beings develop psychologically in the same ways? If there are differences, what are they and what may account for them? How do people in different societies conceive of personality and psychological development? What kinds of cultural variation might be explained by psychological factors? This chapter discusses some of the attempts made by researchers to answer these questions.

## THE UNIVERSALITY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT

Anthropologists became interested in psychology in the early years of this century, partly because they did not believe that human nature was completely revealed in Western societies, as psychologists then generally assumed. Only recently have many psychologists joined anthropologists in questioning the assumption that humans are exactly the same psychologically in all societies. Psychologist Otto Klineberg, for example, scolded his colleagues in 1974: "My contact with anthropology affected me somewhat like a religious conversion. How could psychologists speak of human attributes and human behavior when they knew only one kind of human being?"3

How can we know what is universal about human behavior and what is variable until we study all kinds of humans? Because humans the world over are the same species and share a very large proportion of genes, we might assume that there is a good deal of similarity across societies in the way people develop psychologically from birth to maturity or in the way people think, feel, and behave. We have already discussed many universals (culture, language, marriage, the incest taboo), but here we discuss some that are related more to psychology. Donald Brown complied a list of probable human universals in the psychological realm.<sup>4</sup> They include the ability to create taxonomies, make binary contrasts, order phenomena, use logical operators (e.g., and, not, equals), plan for the future, and have an understanding of the world and what it is about. With regard to ideas about people, it seems universal to have a concept of the self or person, to recognize individual faces, to try to discern other persons' intentions from observable clues (in their faces, utterances, and actions), and to imagine what others are thinking. With regard to emotions, people seem universally to be able to empathize with the feelings of others, facially communicate and recognize (as well as hide or mimic) the emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, and contempt (see the box titled "Do Masks Show Emotion in Universal Ways?" in the chapter on the arts), smile when friendly, cry when in pain or unhappy, play for fun, show and feel affection for others, feel sexual attraction, envy, and jealousy, and have similar childhood fears (e.g., fear of strangers).

What about psychological development? We saw in the chapter on communication and language that certain aspects of language acquisition appear to be universal across cultures. In what respects is psychological development the same the world over? In what respects is it different?

#### Early Research on Emotional Development

When Margaret Mead went to American Samoa in the mid-1920s, psychologists believed that adolescence was universally a period of "storm and stress" because of the physiological changes that occur at puberty. Mead's observations of, and interviews with, Samoan adolescent girls led her to doubt the idea that adolescence was necessarily a time of turmoil. The Samoan girls apparently showed little evidence of emotional upheaval and rebelliousness, and therefore it was questionable whether psychological development in adolescence was the same in all societies.<sup>5</sup>

Bronislaw Malinowski was another early anthropologist who questioned the universality of an assumption about emotional development, in this case Freud's assumption that young boys universally see themselves (unconsciously) as sexual rivals of their fathers for possession of their mothers. Freud had called these feelings the Oedipus complex, after the character in Greek mythology who killed his father and married his mother without knowing that they were his parents. Freud thought that all boys before the age of seven or so would show hostility toward their fathers, but Malinowski disagreed on the basis of his fieldwork in the matrilineal Trobriand Islands.<sup>6</sup>

Malinowski suggested that young boys in nonmatrilineal societies may feel hostility toward the father not as a sexual rival but as the disciplinarian. Malinowski proposed this theory because he thought that the Oedipus complex works differently in matrilineal societies. Boys in matrilineal societies may feel more hostile toward their mother's brother—who is the main authority figure in the matrilineal kin group—than toward their father.

Derek Freeman criticized Mead's conclusions about Samoa,7 and Melford Spiro challenged Malinowski's conclusions about the Trobriand Islanders.<sup>8</sup> Mead and Malinowski may or may not have been correct about the societies they studied (we really cannot know for sure because we cannot travel back in time), but the issues they raised remain crucial to the question of whether psychological development is similar in all societies. To find out, we need research in many societies, not just a few. Only on the basis of extensive crosscultural research will we be able to decide whether

stages of emotional development can be affected by cultural differences.

For example, it is only recently that adolescence has been systematically studied crossculturally. Alice Schlegel and Herbert Barry reported that adolescence is generally not a period of overt rebelliousness. The reason, they suggested, is related to the fact that most people in most societies live with or near (and depend on) close kin before and after they grow up. Only in societies like our own, where children leave home when they grow up, might adolescents be rebellious, possibly to prepare emotionally for going out on their own.<sup>9</sup> (Recall the box titled "Neolocality and Adolescent Rebellion: Are They Related?" in the chapter on marital residence and kinship.)

#### Research on Cognitive Development

One day the two of us went out for pizza. The pizza maker was laughing hilariously, and we asked what was so funny. He told us: "I just asked the guy ahead

of you, 'How many slices do you want me to cut the pizza into, six or eight?' 'Six,' he said, 'I'm not very hungry."

According to a theory of cognitive (intellectual) development suggested by Jean Piaget, the renowned Swiss psychologist, the "not very hungry" guy may not have acquired the concept of conservation, which characterizes a stage of thinking normally acquired by children between the ages of seven and eleven in Western societies.<sup>10</sup> The pizza customer ahead of us, like many very young children, seemed not to understand that certain properties of an object (such as quantity, weight, and volume) remain constant even if the object is divided into small pieces or removed to a container of a different shape. They have not acquired the mental image of reversibility, the ability to imagine that if you put the pizza back together again it would be the same size whether you had previously cut it into eight or six slices. To the child or adult who has not acquired the ability to reverse actions mentally, eight slices may seem like more pizza than six slices, because eight is more than six.

Piaget's theory says that the development of thinking in humans involves a series of stages, each of which is characterized by different mental skills. To get to a higher stage of thinking, one has to pass through a lower stage. So, Piaget's theory would predict that the pizza customer would not be able to think systematically about the possible outcomes of hypothetical situations (a defining feature of Piaget's formal-operational stage) because he had not acquired the notion of conservation and the other mental skills that characterize the previous (concreteoperational) stage of cognitive development.

What does the available evidence suggest about the universality of Piaget's supposed stages? And do people the world over get to each stage at the same age? The first stage of development (senso*rimotor*) has not been investigated in many societies, but the results of studies conducted so far are remarkably consistent. They support Piaget's notion that there is a predictable order in the sequence of stages.<sup>11</sup> And, on the basis of their reactions to the same conditions, babies in different places seem to think similarly. For example, a comparison of French babies and Baoulé babies in the Ivory Coast (West Africa) showed that the Baoulé babies, who had never seen objects such as red plastic tubes and paper clips, nevertheless tried to pass the clips through the tubes in the same way the French babies did. The two sets of babies even made the same kinds of errors.<sup>12</sup> And even though they have few

toys, the Baoulé babies showed advances over French babies on tasks such as using instruments to increase the reach of the arm. But Baoulé babies are allowed to touch all kinds of objects, even things that Europeans consider dangerous.<sup>13</sup>

Most of the cross-cultural studies of Piaget's stages have focused on the transition between the second (preoperational) and third (concreteoperational) stages, particularly the attainment of the concept of conservation. The results of many of these studies are somewhat puzzling. Although older children are generally more likely to show conservation than younger children, it is not clear what to make of the apparent finding that the attainment of conservation is much delayed in many non-Western populations. Indeed, in some places most of the adults tested do not appear to understand one or more of the conservation properties.

Can this be true? Do people in different cultures differ that much in intellectual functioning, or is there some problem with the way conservation is measured? Is it possible that an adult who just brought water from the river in a large jug and poured it into five smaller containers does not know that the quantity of water is still the same? We may also be skeptical about the findings on the formaloperational stage. Most of the studies of formaloperational thinking have found little evidence of such thinking in non-Western populations. But people in nonliterate societies surely have formaloperational thinking if they can navigate using the stars, remember how to return to camp after a 15mile trek, or identify how people are related to each other three and more generations back.

![](_page_3_Picture_7.jpeg)

#### A girl four-and-a-half-years-old is being tested for conservation (of area).

One reason to be skeptical about the apparent findings regarding delay of conservation and formal-operational thinking is that most of the cross-cultural psychologists have taken tests developed here (in our own and other Western countries) to measure cognitive development elsewhere.<sup>14</sup> This procedure puts non-Westerners at a considerable disadvantage, because they are not as familiar as Westerners with the test materials and the whole testing situation. In tests of conservation, for example, researchers have often used strange-looking glass cylinders and beakers. Some researchers who have used natively familiar materials, however, have gotten different results. Douglass Price-Williams found no difference between Tiv (West Africa) and European children in understanding the conservation of earth, nuts, and number.<sup>15</sup> Also, some researchers have retested children after brief training sessions and found that they improved substantially. It would seem then that children anywhere can acquire the concept of conservation if they have had preparatory life experiences or appropriate training.<sup>16</sup>

The results of tests elsewhere on formaloperational thinking may also be questionable. Such tests ask questions dealing with content that is taught here in science and mathematics classes. It should not be surprising then that schooled individuals usually do better than the nonschooled on tests of formal-operational thinking. And where compulsory schooling is lacking, we should not expect people to do well on tests of such thinking.<sup>17</sup>

In trying to find out what may be universal in emotional and cognitive development, researchers have discovered some apparent differences between societies. These differences, which we now turn to, need to be explored and explained.

## CROSS-CULTURAL VARIATION IN PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS

Thinking about personality differences seems to come easily to many North Americans. We like to talk about the psychology of those we know. We speculate why one friend is emotional, why another has a hot temper, why another is shy. We may also wonder why one friend is likely to remember faces and why another is a whiz at computers. We are interested in personality as an individual characteristic, and we emphasize the uniqueness of each

individual. Indeed, because every person has a unique combination of genetic traits and life experiences, we can say that in some ways no person is like any other person. But anthropologists are interested in approaching personality from a different perspective. Instead of focusing on the uniqueness of an individual, psychological anthropologists are interested in those aspects of personality that may be common in a population.

Why should we expect different societies to differ in some personality characteristics? It is generally agreed that our personalities are the result of an interaction between genetic inheritance and life experiences. But a considerable portion of one's life experiences (as well as one's genes) is shared with others. Parents undoubtedly exert a major influence on the way we grow up. Because family members share similar life experiences (as well as genes), they may be somewhat similar in personality. But we have to consider why a particular family raises children the way it does. To some extent, all families are unique. Yet much of the way parents rear children is influenced by their culture-by typical patterns of family life and by shared conceptions of the way to bring up children.

It is not easy to determine the extent to which members of a society share conceptions about child rearing. As we look around at families in our own society we see differences in upbringing that reflect different ideas about the "right" way to raise children. Indeed, some parents seem determined to bring up their children in unconventional (in terms of our society) ways. Still, in a study of unconventional California families (headed by single mothers, unmarried couples, or living in communes), researchers found that compared with parents in other societies, these so-called unconventional parents did not differ that much from conventional parents (married, living in nuclear families).<sup>18</sup> For example, even though unconventional California mothers breast-fed their children for a significantly longer period than conventional mothers did, both types of mothers usually stopped breast-feeding after about a year, which is far below the worldwide average. In 70 percent of the world's societies, mothers typically breast-feed children for at least two years; last-born children may be weaned even later. In a few societies, such as the Chenchu of India, children typically were not weaned until they were five or six years old.<sup>19</sup> Both the unconventional and conventional California parents differed in other ways too, compared with parents in most other societies. In the California study, no parent (conventional or unconventional) was observed to carry a baby more than 25 percent of the time, but it is common in many preindustrial societies for babies to be held more than half the day.<sup>20</sup>

![](_page_5_Picture_1.jpeg)

It is only when we examine other societies and their patterns of child rearing that our own cultural conceptions begin to become apparent. Consider how societies vary in how quickly parents respond to an infant's needs, in other words, the degree of "indulgence." In many aspects of indulgence—amount of time holding, feeding on demand, responding to crying-industrialized societies such as the United States tend to indulge babies less than do preindustrialized societies. In contrast to those preindustrial societies in which babies are held more than half the day, consider the United States, England, and the Netherlands, where babies may spend most of the day in cagelike devices such as playpens or cribs. It is estimated that babies are held or touched only  $12-20$  percent of their daytime hours in these countries (and in Japan). The same pattern continues at nighttime. In preindustrial societies, babies are much more apt to be close to another person, usually sleeping with the mother in the same bed or, if not in the same bed, in the same room. During the day, babies are breast-fed in all preindustrial societies, usually on demand. In industrialized societies, bottle-feeding is common, and feeding is usually spaced out every few hours; in some preindustrial societies babies are fed twenty to forty times a day. And in many preindustrial societies people respond very quickly to an infant's crying. For example, among the Efe of the Ituri Forest in central Africa, a three-

![](_page_5_Picture_3.jpeg)

One major difference in childrearing between the West and other places is the degree to which an infant is held by a caretaker during the day. In the United States and other Western countries, an infant spends much of the day in a crib, playpen, or stroller. This Bai baby from Yunnan Province in China spends a good deal of the day in physical contact with the mother.

month-old infant who cries gets a response within 10 seconds 75 percent of the time. In the United States, a caregiver deliberately does not respond at all 44-46 percent of the time.<sup>21</sup>

The cross-cultural variation just described seems to reflect cultural attitudes toward child rearing. Parents in the United States say that they do not want their babies to be dependent and clingy—they want to produce independent and self-reliant children. Whether children become self-reliant because of our kind of child rearing is debatable,<sup>22</sup> but our attitudes about child rearing are certainly consistent with our practices.

Let us again consider the Yanomamö and the Semai. With respect to aggression, the two societies have very different ways of dealing with children. (The difference is not surprising, in view of the way adult behaviors and attitudes differ in the two societies.) Yanomamö boys are encouraged to be fierce and are rarely punished for hitting either their parents or the girls in the village. One father, for example, lets his son Ariwari

> beat him on the face and head to express his anger and temper, laughing and commenting on his ferocity. Although Ariwari is only about four years old, he has already learned that the appropriate response to a flash of anger is to strike someone with his hand or with an object, and it is not uncommon for him to give his father a healthy smack in the face whenever something displeases him. He is frequently goaded into hitting his father by teasing, being rewarded by gleeful cheers of assent from his mother and from the other adults in the household.<sup>23</sup>

Whereas the Yanomamö clearly and actively encourage aggression, the Semai communicate nonviolence in more subtle ways. They say, in fact, that they do not teach children. The Semai expect children to be nonviolent and are shocked when they are not. When a child loses her temper, an adult will simply cart her off and bring her home. The Semai do not physically punish a child's aggression—and this approach may be one of the most important teaching devices of all. With such teaching-by example-a child hardly ever sees an aggressive model and has no aggression to imitate.<sup>24</sup> In comparison with the ways Semai and Yanomamö parents treat their children, most North American parents are probably somewhere in the middle. Hardly any North American parents would encourage children to hit them in the face or encourage them to hit other children. Yet many North American

parents probably use physical punishment sometimes, and many feel that boys especially should "stand up for themselves" if another child provokes a fight.

As these examples suggest, societies vary in how they raise children. We assume that the way children are reared determines in part the type of personality they will have in adulthood. In other words, different societies, with different customs of child rearing, will probably tend to produce different kinds of people. Other cultural differences also may produce differences in typical personality characteristics. As we will see, growing up in an extended family and going to school seem to affect personality development. We do not mean to suggest, however, that all personalities in a society are alike. An individual's uniqueness is derived from her or his distinctive genetic endowment and life experiences-and thus one personality will be somewhat different from another within the same culture or subculture.

Cultural anthropologists are interested in common or shared patterns of behavior, belief, feeling, and thinking. Psychological anthropologists are therefore often interested in those aspects of personality that are common or typically shared with others—other members of the society or other members of some subcultural group. Personality attributes are not all-or-nothing characteristics but usually need to be described or measured in terms of degree. So, for example, aggressiveness is not present or absent in a person, but is found to a greater or lesser degree in some people than in others. Similarly, when we say that a great deal of physical or verbal aggression is a characteristic personality trait in a particular society, we are making a relative judgment. For example, when we compare ethnographic descriptions of the Yanomamö and Semai, we can be fairly certain that the Yanomamö typically display much more aggression than the Semai. If fieldworkers based their judgments on systematic comparisons of behavior, we could say how often aggressive behavior is exhibited in a culture, and we could calculate the modal frequency of aggression among individuals within a given period of time. That modal frequency could then be compared with the modal frequencies of such behavior in other societies.

Just as culture is never fixed or static, so typical personality characteristics are never static. Individuals often alter their behavior in adapting to changing circumstances. When enough individuals in a society have altered their own behavior or the way they bring up their children, typical personality characteristics will also presumably have changed.

#### Child-Rearing Explanations

Many researchers have tried to discover if variation in child-rearing customs can account for observed psychological differences. Socialization is a term used by both anthropologists and psychologists to describe the development, through the influence of parents and other people, of patterns of behavior in children (and attitudes and values) that conform to cultural expectations. Parents and others often try to socialize children directly by rewarding certain behaviors and ignoring or punishing other behaviors. Socialization can be indirect or subtle as well as direct. In assigning tasks to children, parents are not only encouraging specific skills needed for adult life, but they may also be subtly communicating what kind of person they want their children to become. Whether children go to school may affect their psychological (particularly cognitive) development. Finally, parents may affect the psychological development of their children by the way they generally feel about them.

Parental Acceptance and Rejection. In a classic study of personality, Cora Du Bois spent almost eighteen months on the island of Alor in eastern Indonesia studying the native Alorese. To understand the Alorese personality, she broke new ground by asking specialists in various fields to assess and interpret her field data independently. These authorities were given no background briefing on Alorese culture or attitudes, nor were they permitted to see Du Bois's general ethnographic notes or interpretations. To a remarkable degree, their findings concurred with hers.<sup>25</sup>

A rather unfavorable picture of the typical Alorese personality emerged from this many-sided investigation. Alorese of both sexes were described by Du Bois and her colleagues as suspicious and antagonistic, prone to violent, emotional, and often jealous outbursts. They tended to be uninterested in the world around them, slovenly in workmanship, and indifferent to goals.

Turning to the possible causal influences, Du Bois and her co-researchers focused on the experiences of the Alorese infant, particularly time gaps between breast-feedings. At the root of much of Alorese personality development, they suggested, is the mother's long absence from the baby during the day; she returns to agricultural work about ten days to two weeks after the birth. Women are the major food suppliers, working daily in the family gardens; men occupy themselves with commercial affairs, usually the trading of pigs, gongs, and kettledrums. The infant is left in the care of the father, an older sibling, or a grandparent, but it is deprived of the breast as well as the mother for most of the day. Substitute foods are given, but infants often spit them out, suggesting that they are not satisfactory. In Freudian terms, the infant experiences oral frustration and resultant anxiety. At the same time, the baby suffers bewildering switches in attention, from loving and petting to neglect and bad-tempered rejection. Thus, maternal neglect in infancy is viewed as being largely responsible for Alorese personality.

But how do we know that maternal neglect is really responsible for the seeming suspiciousness and outbursts of jealousy among the Alorese? Perhaps maternal neglect is responsible, but the cause or causes could also be any number of other conditions of Alorese life. For example, some critics have suggested that the high prevalence of debilitating diseases in Alor may be responsible for much of the behavior of the Alorese.<sup>26</sup> For us to be more certain that a particular aspect of child rearing produces certain effects on Alorese personality, we must compare the people of Alor with people in other societies. Do other societies with this kind of maternal neglect show the same pattern of personality traits? If they do, then the presumed association becomes more plausible. If they do not, then the interpretation becomes questionable.

Although subsequent researchers have not specifically followed up on the possible effects of time gaps between breast-feedings, Ruth and Robert Munroe studied the effects of more versus less holding by the mother in infancy on Logoli children.<sup>27</sup> The Munroes had observational information on how often infants were held, and they were able to interview many of these individuals as children five years later. They were interested in seeing whether children who had been held more often by their mothers were more secure, trusting, and optimistic. So they designed a series of personality measures appropriate for young children. As a measure of optimism, they showed children smiling faces and nonsmiling faces and asked which they preferred. As measures of trust, they looked to see how long a child was willing to stay in a room with a stranger or play with new toys. The results of the study suggest that children who were often held or carried by their mothers as infants are significantly more trusting and optimistic at age five than are other children. Somewhat to their surprise, the Munroes found that, although time held by other caregivers did not predict more trust and optimism, the sheer number of different people who had held the infant did predict more trust and optimism. Holding by the mother was important, but trust was even greater if the baby had been held by a large number of other persons. One possible explanation is that a highly trusting mother is likely to allow many others to hold the baby; by doing so she conveys trust to the baby.

What about the quality of parenting? Are there positive effects on personality when parents show love, warmth, and affection to their children and negative effects when parents are indifferent or hostile to their children? These questions are difficult to investigate cross-culturally because cultures may vary in the ways feeling is expressed. If love and affection are not expressed in the same ways, outsiders may misinterpret parental behavior. Nevertheless, Ronald Rohner and his colleagues did extensive work on the effects of parental acceptance and rejection on children after infancy. In a crosscultural comparison of 101 societies, using measures based on ethnographic materials, Rohner found that children tend to be hostile and aggressive when they are neglected and not treated affectionately by their parents. In societies in which children tend to be rejected, adults seem to view life and the world as unfriendly, uncertain, and hostile.<sup>28</sup> Other studies have compared individuals in different cultures to see if the cross-cultural findings were supported. In general, they were. In addition to finding the world more unfriendly and hostile, individuals who think they were rejected are likely to have negative evaluations of themselves.<sup>29</sup>

Under what conditions is parental rejection likely in childhood? The Rohner study suggests that rejection is likely where mothers get no relief from child care; when fathers and grandparents play a role in child care, rejection is less likely. Foodcollecting societies (those dependent on wild food resources) tend to show warmth and affection to their children. More complex societies are less likely to be affectionate to their children.<sup>30</sup> It is not clear why this should be, but perhaps parental rejection is more likely where parents have less leisure time. Less leisure time may make parents more tired and irritable, and they may therefore have less patience with their children. As we noted in the chapter on economic systems, leisure time probably decreases as cultural complexity increases. More complex societies, which rely on intensive agriculture, also tend to have more economic uncertainty, as we noted in the chapter on getting food. Not only do they tend to have more risk of famines and food shortages, but they also tend to have social inequality. In societies

A father in Laos bathes his child. In societies where fathers and grandparents help to care for children, the children are less likely to be rejected.

![](_page_8_Picture_6.jpeg)

with social classes, many families may not have enough food and money to satisfy their needs, and this factor can also produce frustration in the parents. Whatever the reasons for parental rejection, it seems to perpetuate itself-children who were rejected tend to reject their own children.

Task Assignment. In our society, young children are not expected to help much with chores. If there are any chores for them (such as tidying up their rooms), they are not likely to affect the welfare of the family or its ability to survive. In contrast, there are societies known to anthropology in which young children, even three- and four-year-olds, are expected to help prepare food, care for animals, and carry water and firewood, as well as clean. A child between five and eight years of age may even be given the responsibility of caring for an infant or toddler for much of the day while the mother works in the fields.<sup>31</sup> What are the effects of such task assignment on personality development?

We now have evidence from more than ten cultures that children who regularly babysit are more nurturant (offer more help and support to others) than are other children, even when they are not babysitting. Some of this evidence comes from a project known as the Six Cultures study, in which different research teams observed children's behavior in Kenya (Nyansongo), Mexico, India, the Philippines, Okinawa, and the United States (New England).<sup>32</sup> Ruth and Robert Munroe collected data on children's behavior in four other cultures that show the same relationship between babysitting and nurturant behavior; the Munroes' data come from Kenya (Logoli), Nepal, Belize, and American Samoa.<sup>33</sup> Clearly, children who babysit infrequently are less attuned to others' needs than are children who babysit often.

Why might task assignment affect the behaviors of children? One possibility is that children learn certain behaviors during performance of the task, and these behaviors become habitual. For example, a responsible babysitter is supposed to offer help. Mothers might directly instruct the babysitter to make sure that happens. But there is probably also an intrinsic satisfaction in doing a job well. For example, it is pleasurable to see an infant smile and laugh, but it is unpleasant to hear a baby cry. We might therefore expect that a child who is assigned babysitting would learn for himself or herself that comforting a baby brings its own rewards.<sup>34</sup>

Children who are assigned many tasks may spend their day in different kinds of settings, and these settings may indirectly influence behavior. For

example, children who are asked to do many household chores are apt to be around both adults and younger children. Children who are assigned few or no tasks are freer to play with their agemates. Some of the results of the Six Cultures project suggest that children tend to be more aggressive the more they associate with other children of the same age. In contrast, children tend to inhibit aggression when they are around adults more.<sup>35</sup> We have already noted that being around younger children may make older children more nurturant. So the kinds of tasks assigned to children may influence behavior not only because certain tasks require certain behaviors (for example, babysitting requires nurturance) but also because the kinds of tasks assigned will place children in different social contexts that may also affect how they behave.

Schooling. Most researchers focus on the parents when they investigate how children are brought up. But in our own and other societies, children may spend a substantial part of their time in school from the age of three or so. What influence does school have on children's social behavior and on how they think as measured by tests? To investigate the effect of schooling, researchers have compared children (or adults) who have not gone to school with those who have. All of this research has been done in societies that do not have compulsory schooling; otherwise we could not compare the schooled with the unschooled. We know relatively little about the influence of school on social behavior. In contrast, we know more about how schooling influences performance on cognitive tests.

Schooling clearly predicts "superior" performance on many cognitive tests, and within the same society schooled individuals will generally do better than the unschooled on those tests. So, for example, nonschooled individuals in non-Western societies are not as likely as schooled individuals to perceive depth in two-dimensional pictures, do not perform as well on tests of memory, are not as likely to classify items in certain ways, and (as we discussed earlier in the chapter) do not display evidence of formal-operational thinking.<sup>36</sup> But schooling does not always produce superior performance on tests of inferential reasoning.<sup>37</sup>

Why does schooling have these effects? Although it is possible that something about schooling creates higher levels of cognitive thinking in some respects, there are other possible explanations. The observed differences may be due to the advantages that schoolchildren have because of their experiences in school, advantages that have nothing to do

Attending school has become customary in many parts of the world, as among the Baoulé tribe of the Ivory Coast. Schooling seems to affect cognitive development, but we do not know exactly how or why.

with general cognitive ability. For example, consider research that asks people to classify or group drawings of geometric shapes that belong together. Suppose a person is shown three cards—a red circle, a red triangle, and a white circle—and is asked which two are most alike. A person could choose to classify in terms of color or in terms of shape. In the United States, young children usually classify by color, and as they get older they classify more often by shape. Many psychologists assume that classification by color is more "concrete" and classification by shape or function is more "abstract." Unschooled adults in many parts of Africa sort by color, not by shape. Does this mean that they are classifying less abstractly? Not necessarily. It may just be that nonschooled Africans classify differently because they are likely to be unfamiliar with the test materials (drawings on paper, geometric shapes).

How can people classify "abstractly" (for example, by shape) if they have never had the experience of handling or seeing shapes that are drawn in two dimensions? Is it likely that they would classify things as triangles if they had never seen a threepointed figure with straight sides? In contrast, consider how much time teachers in this country spend exposing and drilling children on various geometric shapes. People who are familiar with certain materials may for that reason alone do better on cognitive tests that use those materials.<sup>38</sup>

A comparative study of Liberian rice farmers in West Africa and U.S. undergraduates also illustrates the point that choice of materials may influence research results. The comparison involved a set of materials familiar to the rice farmers (bowls of rice) and a set of materials (geometric cards) familiar to the undergraduates. Rice farmers appeared to classify more "abstractly" than undergraduates when they were asked to classify rice, and undergraduates seemed to classify more "abstractly" than rice farmers when they classified geometric cards.<sup>39</sup>

Schooled individuals may also enjoy an advantage on many cognitive tests just because they are familiar with tests and the way tests ask them to think of new situations. For example, consider the reaction of a nonschooled person in central Asia who was asked the following question by a Russian psychologist interested in measuring logical thinking: "In the Far North where there is snow, all bears are white. Novaya Zemlya is in the Far North and there is always snow there. What color are the bears there?" The reply was, "We don't talk about what we haven't seen." Such a reply was typical of non「 理理研究 開催 しん

## DO SCHOOLS TEACH VALUES?

In the United States there is controversy nowadays about the teaching of values. Many people think that the schools should teach values; others think that the teaching of values should be left to parents and family. But whether or not schools should explicitly teach values, research on schools in different countries suggests that they do at least implicitly teach values. They do not just teach content.

Joseph Tobin, David Wu, and Dana Davidson videotaped preschool classroom scenes in Japan, China, and the United States. In each country they asked children, teachers, parents, and school administrators to comment on the scenes in all three countries. We can get a feel for how different values are implicitly taught in each country by reviewing the comments.

When individuals in the United States viewed the Japanese tape, they were generally bothered by two things. One was the fact that children in Japan often did the same things simultaneously as a group. For example, the teacher showed what to fold first (and subsequently) to make an origami bird figure, and the children followed along. U.S. parents and teachers said that children should have more choice in what to do and how to do it. The second thing that bothered people in the United States (as well as in China) was that the teacher in Japan appeared to ignore what we might consider "unruly" behavior by the children. For example, when children got restless during a group workbook activity, they would leave their seats, joke with friends, or go to the bathroom. In the tape, a particularly troublesome boy talked loudly, sometimes purposely hurt other children, and threw ,things around, but the teacher seemed to ignore these behaviors. People in this country and China thought that the teacher should try to do something in such situations. In Japan, however, most of the teachers preferred not to call attention to, or single out, a troublesome child. Japanese teachers expect such a child eventually to behave more appropriately, and they encourage the other children to exert social pressure in that direction. In Lois Peak's words: "Learning to go to school in Japan is primarily defined as training in group life."

Most of the activities in the Chinese preschool were highly structured. For example, the first task of the day was building with blocks, but in contrast to the style at the Japanese preschool the children in China were expected to complete the task on their own and to do so in silence. If they spoke, the teacher reprimanded them. They used a picture as a guide to what to do. When they were done, the teachers checked their work. If they got it right, they took it apart and rebuilt it; if they got it wrong they were asked to correct it. An arithmetic lesson followed. Children then ate the lunch that was brought for them into the classroom. Teachers monitored the lunch to make sure that the children ate all their food and ate in silence. After an afternoon nap, the children listened to a patriotic story and then had relay races, which were followed by fifteen minutes of free play. Supper was served at 5:00 P.M. and parents came at 6:00. In seeing the videotapes, Americans and Japanese were bothered by the rigidity and "overcontrol" of the children and by the lack of privacy in their communal bathroom.

Much research needs to be done on exactly how and why schooling affects cognition. Is it important which specific things are taught? Is it important to be asked to attend to questions that are out of context? Is being literate a factor? This last ques-

tion) when the dispute was not settled by talking.

Even though they do not teach values explicitly, these preschools clearly convey values by how they deal with the children. First is the importance of the group versus the individual. In the U.S. preschool, most of the daily activities allowed individual choice of some kind; in both Japan and China group activities predominated, although the Japanese preschool allowed flexible arrival times, more free play, and more freedom to talk or move about than the Chinese preschool. Second is the source of control. The Japanese teachers relied informally on the group to control the children's behavior. For example, after nine months the unruly boy sat by himself at lunch; the other children did not want to sit with him. In contrast, the Chinese teachers saw to it that the children behaved like others in the group by exerting strong control over the children's behavior. The U.S. teachers also intervened in response to unruly behavior.

Cultural values are not unchanging. Although many Japanese educational administrators thought that the Japanese preschool was quite "Japanese" in style, and therefore quite satisfactory, a considerable number of Japanese parents and teachers were critical of the school and said there were "better" schools in Japan that were more like the U.S. preschool. And some Japanese thought that more attention should be paid to the individual needs of troubled children. Some Chinese complained, when they saw the tapes of the Chinese school, that it was too "old-fashioned." Yet even they agreed that the amount of freedom displayed at the Japanese and U.S. schools was too much. And the Chinese stressed the importance of schools' not "spoiling" children, especially now that parents are not supposed to have more than one child.

Whether or not they consciously intend to, preschools in different countries do seem to socialize their children according to what is valued in the culture.

tion was the subject of research among the Vai of Liberia, who had a somewhat unusual situation in that schooling and literacy were not completely confounded. The Vai had an indigenous script learned outside of school. Thus, researchers Sylvia

Scribner and Michael Cole were able to see how Vai individuals who were literate but not formally schooled compared with others who were formally schooled (and literate) and those who were unschooled (and illiterate). They found some, but relatively minor, effects of literacy itself; cognitive test performance was much more affected by the number of years of schooling. Similar results come from a study of the Cree of northern Ontario who have their own syllabic script learned outside of school.<sup>41</sup> These comparisons suggest that some other aspects of schooling are more important than literacy as determinants of cognitive performance.

By studying other societies where schooling is not universal, we may be better able to understand just what role schooling plays in cognitive and other development. That schooling makes for so much difference in cognitive performance raises the serious issue of how much of what we observe about child development in our society and in other Western societies is simply a function of what children are taught in school. After all, children who grow up in this society not only get older each year, they also go one year further in school.

Schools are not just places to learn a particular curriculum. Children learn to interact with one another and with adults who are not parents and family. Therefore we might expect that schools not only shape cognition but also convey important cultural attitudes, values, and appropriate ways of behaving toward others (see the box titled "Do Schools Teach Values?").

#### **General Cultural Themes** as Explanations

Many of the aspects of socialization we have discussed are fairly specific—customs such as how often a baby is held, whether children are encouraged to be aggressive, what kinds of tasks are assigned to children, and whether they attend formal schools. As we have suggested, many of these specific aspects of socialization may have important effects on how a person grows up psychologically. But children may also be influenced by more general themes or ideas prevalent in the culture. Earlier, for example, when we discussed various aspects of infant care how often babies are held, how quickly they are responded to-we mentioned that many customs seem to be aspects of a larger pattern, such as high or low indulgence. But what ideas underlie and possibly explain these larger patterns? One likely general theme in the United States is many parents' belief that the child should not grow up spoiled or dependent. Perhaps then there are general ideas or themes behind a culture's specific socialization patterns. These general themes may be expressed in a variety of ways.

*Concepts of the Self.* Anthropologists have begun to study different cultural ideas of personhood or concept of the "self." Many have concluded that the concept of self in many non-Western societies is quite different from the Western conception. Clifford Geertz described the Western conception of the person as "bounded, unique, . . . a dynamic center of awareness, emotion, judgment, and action organized into a distinctive whole."42 He claimed, on the basis of his fieldwork in Java, Bali, and Morocco, that those societies have very different conceptions of a person, not only different from each other, but quite different from the Western conception. For example, he said that the Balinese describe a person as having many different roles, like an actor who plays different characters. The unique characteristics of a person are not emphasized; what is emphasized are the "masks" people wear and the "parts" they play.

Geertz focused on the variation and uniquenesses in different cultures' conceptions of the self. But other scholars think that there are recognizable and predictable patterns in this variation. One of the most talked about patterns is the Western emphasis on the self as an autonomous individual and the non-Western emphasis on the relations a person has with others.<sup>43</sup> Labels used to describe such Western/non-Western cultural differences are "individualism" versus "holism" or "collectivism," "egocentric" versus "sociocentric," and the like. For example, the Japanese concept of self is often described as "relational" or "situational": people exist in networks of relationships and the ideal person has the ability to shift easily from one social situation to another.44

There are two major objections to the idea that the Western sense of self should be contrasted with the non-Western. The first is that studies of other cultures have suggested other dimensions of variation besides "individualism" versus "collectivism." For example, the traditional Inuit concept inummarik, "a genuine person," seems to include a lifelong process of ecological involvementinteracting with animals and the environment as well as people.<sup>45</sup> A culture's concept of self then may include other dimensions besides individual versus collective. A second objection to the Western/non-Western contrast is that it may not be based on adequate evidence. As Melford Spiro pointed out, it is necessary to find out how a sample of individuals in a society actually view themselves. The ideal in the culture might be different from the actual.<sup>46</sup> For example, individuals even in the United States do not just describe themselves as autonomous. When Jane Wellenkamp and Douglas Hollan interviewed individuals in this country about their feelings about the death of someone close, they got statements about autonomy (such as "I can stand on my own" and "At least you have yourself"), but they also got statements reflecting interdependence ("You realize that they're gone and that a part of you has gone with them").<sup>47</sup> This is not to say that the autonomy of the individual isn't important in the United States. It is. But individuals also realize that they are interdependent. How we actually think of ourselves may not be so different from how people in other societies think of themselves.

If a cultural theme such as individualism is important, societies may express or convey this theme in many ways. It may start right after birth, as when a baby is put in a crib or bassinet to sleep alone rather than with someone in the family. Young children may be given their "own" toys. They may go to preschool or daycare, where they are encouraged to make their own choices (see the box titled "Do Schools Teach Values?"). And schools for older children may require individual, not group, achievement. Does the theme of individualism have to be taught explicitly? Probably not, because it can be conveyed in so many different ways.

### Adaptational Explanations

The cultural anthropologist seeks not only to establish connections between child-rearing customs and personality traits but also to learn why those customs differ in the first place. Some anthropologists believe that child-rearing practices are largely adaptive—that a society produces the kinds of personalities best suited to performance of the activities necessary for the survival of the society. As John Whiting and Irvin Child expressed it, "The economic, political and social organs of a society-the basic customs surrounding the nourishment, sheltering and protection of its members . . . seem a likely source of influence on child training practices."48 The belief that childrearing practices are adaptive does not mean that societies always produce the kinds of persons they need. Just as in the biological realm, where we see poor adaptations and extinctions of species and subspecies, so we may expect that societies sometimes produce personality traits that are maladapted to the requirements of living in that society. So we cannot assume that just because a trait is present it must be adaptive. We cannot come to that conclusion unless we carefully investigate whether the trait is beneficial or harmful.<sup>49</sup> But we do expect that most societies that have survived to be

recorded have produced personality traits that are mostly adaptive.

Robert LeVine suggested an adaptational explanation for the frequent holding and feeding of infants, and quick response of caretakers to them, in preindustrial societies.<sup>50</sup> Only 1 percent of infants die in industrial societies in the first year of life, but typically more than 20 percent die in preindustrial societies. What can parents do? Parents often do not have access to modern medical care, but they can respond to a baby's fussing immediately if the baby is with them. Also, babies may be safer off the ground if there are cooking fires, dangerous insects, and snakes in the vicinity. When survival is not so much at issue, LeVine suggested, parents can safely leave babies more on their own.

Herbert Barry, Irvin Child, and Margaret Bacon cross-culturally investigated the possibility that child-training practices are adapted to the economic requirements of a society. Such requirements, they theorized, might explain why some societies strive to develop "compliant" (responsible, obedient, nurturant) children while others aim more for "assertiveness" (independence, self-reliance, and achievement).<sup>51</sup> The cross-cultural results indicated that agricultural and herding societies are likely to stress responsibility and obedience, whereas hunting-and-gathering societies tend to stress selfreliance and individual assertiveness. The investigators suggested that agricultural and herding societies cannot afford departures from established routine, because departures might jeopardize the food supply for long periods. Such societies are therefore likely to emphasize compliance with tradition. Departures from routine in a hunter-gatherer society cannot cause much damage to a food supply that has to be collected anew almost every day. So, hunter-gatherers can afford to emphasize individual initiative.

Although our own society relies on food production and has large stores of accumulated food, we seem more like hunter-gatherers in emphasizing individual initiative. Are we then exceptions to the Barry, Child, and Bacon findings? Not really. Hardly any of us are farmers (in the United States, only 2 percent of the total population is still on the farm), and most of us expect that we can "forage" in the supermarket or "store" just about anytime. Perhaps more important is the fact that our highly commercial economy, with most people dwelling in or near cities, requires us to compete to get jobs to make a living. In our kind of economy, then, individual initiative is important too. Consider the results of a cross-national comparison of eight countries in which the researchers asked parents what quality

People relying greatly on food production tend to stress responsibility and obedience. A Taos Pueblo girl helps others husk corn.

they most wanted their school-age children to have. Independence and self-reliance were seldom mentioned by parents in the more rural countries (Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand), but they were often mentioned in the more urban countries (Korea, Singapore, and the United States).<sup>52</sup>

Child-rearing practices may also be affected by household characteristics. Leigh Minturn and William Lambert reported, on the basis of data from the Six Cultures study, that children of families who live in cramped quarters tend to be punished more strongly for fighting with others than are children of families who have ample space. The more people living in a house, the less apt a parent is to permit disobedience.<sup>53</sup> This observation is consistent with the finding of a cross-cultural study, conducted by John Whiting, that societies with extended-family households are more likely than societies with nuclear families to severely punish aggression in children.<sup>54</sup>

Whether adults express aggression freely may be related to a society's economy and social environment. In a comparative study of personality differences between pastoralists and farmers in four societies in East Africa, Robert Edgerton found that pastoralists were more willing than farmers to express aggression openly. As a matter of fact, pastoralists seemed freer to express all kinds of emotion-including sadness and depression. Although farmers displayed reluctance to express overt aggression themselves, they were quite willing to talk about witchcraft and sorcery practiced by others. How can we explain these personality differences? Edgerton proposed that the life-style of farmers, who must spend their lives cooperating with a fixed set of neighbors, requires them to contain their feelings, particularly hostile feelings. (But these

feelings may not go away, and so the farmers might "see them" in others.) Pastoralists, on the other hand, can more readily move away in conflict situations because they are not as dependent on a fixed set of individuals. Not only might they be able to express aggression more openly, but such aggression may even be adaptive. The pastoralists studied by Edgerton engaged frequently in raids and counterraids involving cattle stealing, and the most aggressive individuals may have had the best chance of surviving the skirmishes.<sup>55</sup>

Might the environment influence the way people in different societies think and perceive (interpret sensory information)? John Berry suggested that different perceptual and cognitive processes may be selected and trained for in societies that differ in their adaptational requirements.<sup>56</sup> Berry's particular focus was on what psychologists call field independence and field dependence.<sup>57</sup> Field independence means being able to isolate a part of a situation from the whole. The opposite perceptual style, field dependence, means that parts are not perceived separately; rather, the whole situation is focused on.

The contrast between field independence and field dependence may become clear if we look at some of the ways they are measured. In the rod-andframe test, a person seated in a darkened room is asked to adjust a tilted luminous rod so that it is upright within a luminous frame. Individuals are considered field dependent if they adjust the rod to line up with the frame when the frame is tilted. Individuals are considered field independent if they adjust the rod to a truly upright position even though the frame is tilted. Field independence is also measured by the ability to see a simply drawn figure

when it is included but somewhat hidden in a more complex picture.

Why should some societies produce people who are more field independent or dependent? Berry suggested that people who rely a lot on hunting must be field independent to be successful, because hunting requires the visual isolation of animals from their backgrounds. Hunters must also learn to visualize themselves in precise relationship to their surroundings so that they can find animals and get back home. In a comparative study of communities in four societies, Berry found that degree of reliance on hunting predicted field independence. The more a community relied on hunting, the more the individuals showed field independence on tests. Those communities more reliant on agriculture tested out to be more field dependent. How might hunters develop field independence as a cognitive style? Different child training might be involved. In the United States and a few other societies, it has been found that children whose parents are very strict are less likely to develop field independence than are children whose parents are lenient.<sup>58</sup> It seems that emotional independence from parents is necessary for the perceptual style of field independence to develop. No matter what the precise mechanism is, we know from the Barry, Child, and Bacon study that huntergatherers are more likely to train children to be individualistic and assertive, and that agriculturalists and herders are more likely to train their children to be compliant. So hunter-gatherers may get their children to develop field independence by stressing emotional independence in childhood.

Investigations have shown that there are gender differences in the United States and other (but not all) cultures in degree of field dependence versus independence.<sup>59</sup> Perhaps these differences reflect the fact that girls are more encouraged to be obedient and responsible and boys more to be independent and self-reliant. And perhaps too gender differences in field dependence versus independence may be related to the fact that girls work more in and around the home, close to others. If so, we might expect that girls who are more field dependent are also more likely to have a morality that stresses interpersonal concerns (see the box titled "Do Women Have a Different Morality?").

#### Possible Genetic and Physiological Influences

Some researchers have suggested that genetic or physiological differences between populations predispose them to have different personality characteristics. Daniel Freedman found differences in "temperament" in newborn babies of different ethnic groups; because he observed newborns, the differences between them were presumed to be genetic. Comparing Chinese and Caucasian newborns (with the families matched on income, number of previous children, and so on), Freedman found that Caucasian babies cried more easily, were harder to console, and fought experimental procedures more. Chinese babies, on the other hand, seemed calmer and more adaptable. Navaho babies were similar to the Chinese, showing even more calmness.<sup>60</sup> Freedman also suggested that an infant's behavior can influence how the parents respond. A calm baby may encourage a calm parental response; a more active baby may encourage a more active response.<sup>61</sup> So, in Freedman's view, babies' genetically determined behavior can lead to ethnic differences in adult personality and caretaking styles.

But we cannot rule out nongenetic explanations of babies' behavior. For example, the mother's diet or her blood pressure could affect the baby's behavior. And it may be that the baby can learn even in the womb. After all, babies in the womb apparently can hear sounds and respond to other stimuli. Therefore, it is possible that in societies in which pregnant women are calm, their babies may have learned calmness even before they were born. Last, we still do not know if the initial differences observed in newborn babies persist to become personality differences in adulthood.

Just as the diet of the mother (including the intake of alcohol and drugs) may affect the developing fetus, the diet of infants and children may also affect their intellectual development and their behavior. Studies have shown that malnutrition is associated with lower levels of activity, less attentiveness, lack of initiative, and low tolerance of frustration. Behavior of children can change with short-term nutrition supplements. For example, Guatemalan children who were given nutritional supplements were observed to have less anxiety, more exploratoriness, and greater involvement in games than children who were not given supplements.<sup>62</sup> The problem of malnutrition is not just a matter of nutrition. Other kinds of care may also be reduced. For example, caretakers of malnourished children may interact with them less than do caretakers of healthy children. As a malnourished child shows reduced activity, caretakers tend to respond to the child with lower frequency and less enthusiasm. Then the child withdraws from interaction, creating a potentially serious vicious cycle.<sup>63</sup>

**New Perspectives on Gender** 

 $\mathbf{r}$ 

#### DO WOMEN HAVE A DIFFERENT MORALITY?

There is widespread agreement that as children mature they develop a sense of self that distinguishes themselves from others. But what kind of sense of self do they develop? Some researchers suggest that different cultures have different conceptions of the self. In particular, the West seems to emphasize the separateness of each person; other cultures emphasize the connection of the self to others.

Several psychologists, including Carol Gilligan, proposed that women, in contrast to men, are more likely to develop a sense of themselves that involves social interaction and connectedness. Gilligan proposed that women also tend to have a different sense

of morality, one that is more apt to consider the feelings of others and the preservation of relationships. Men, she suggested, are more likely to emphasize rules or principles that are applied equally and impartially to individuals. Is there any substantial evidence for her claims about gender differences in morality?

Some studies have interviewed females and males and explicitly compared their statements about themselves and about solutions to moral dilemmas. The responses are coded for the degree to which the self is described as "autonomous" or as "connected" and the degree to which responses to moral dilemmas are couched in "justice" or "care"

terms. "Well, you have to think about whether it is right . . . or whether it is wrong," is an example of a statement couched in justice terms. "I wanted them to get along . . . I didn't want anybody getting in fights or anything" is an example of a statement couched in "care" terms.

So far the research, conducted mostly in the United States among well-educated populations, suggests that, although women more often than men do tend to describe themselves as "connected" and more often display a "caring" morality, there is no absolute separation between the genders. Most people, regardless of gender, give "connected" and "autonomous" statements

Physiological (not necessarily genetic) differences between populations may also be responsible for some personality differences in adulthood. Research by Ralph Bolton suggests that a physiological condition known as hypoglycemia may be responsible for the high levels of aggression recorded among the Qolla of Peru.<sup>64</sup> (People with hypoglycemia experience a big drop in their blood sugar level after they ingest food.) Bolton found that about 55 percent of the males he tested in a Qolla village had hypoglycemia. Moreover, those men with the most aggressive life histories tended to be hypoglycemic. Whether hypoglycemia is induced by genetic or environmental factors (or both), the condition can be alleviated by a change in diet.

#### Mental Illness

So far in this chapter, we have discussed crosscultural universals and societal differences in "normal" behavior, but anthropologists have also been

ences in abnormal behavior. Central to the study of abnormal behavior is how to define it. Is abnormality relative? That is, can what is normal in one society be abnormal in another? Or, alternatively, are there universals in abnormality cross-culturally? In a very widely read book, Ruth Benedict

intrigued by questions about similarities and differ-

suggested that abnormality was relative. In her view, behavior thought to be appropriate and normal in one society can be considered abnormal in another.<sup>65</sup> Many German officials, for instance, were regarded in every way as normal by their neighbors and co-workers during the period of Nazi control. Yet these officials committed acts of inhumanity so vicious that to many observers in other Western societies they appeared criminally insane. The Saora of Orissa (India) provide another example of behavior normal to one society that would be abnormal to another society. The Saora took for granted that certain of their womenfolk regularly were courted by lovers from the supernatural world, married them,

about themselves, and most people express "justice" and "care" concerns with regard to moral dilemmas. If there is a difference between the genders in a culture, it is only in tendency not in a completely different approach to morality.

Although moral development in childhood has been studied in several cultures, there is relatively little research that directly addresses the issues raised by Gilligan. To be sure, research by David Stimpson and his colleagues compared educated university students in Korea, China, Thailand, and the United States and found support for the idea that women were more concerned with affection, compassion, and sensitivity to the needs of others, as compared with men. But that study did not specifically ask for responses to moral dilemmas. Some other researchers suggest that the picture may be more complicated, because concepts of morality may vary quite a bit from the two types described by Gilligan. For example, Joan Miller found that middle-class Hindu Indians generally had a very strong sense of interpersonal morality compared with people in the United States. But the Hindu Indian morality was not based on individual concern for others; rather their responses to moral dilemmas were strongly influenced by considerations of social duty. And Miller found no gender differences in responses.

All we can conclude now is that the genders may have somewhat different moralities in some cultures. We need more research on how morality may vary by gender as well as by culture.

and had children (who were never seen, yet allegedly were suckled at night).<sup>66</sup> Behavior that is so alien to our own makes it no easy task for researchers to identify mental illness in other societies, let alone compare more complex and less complex societies on rates of mental disorder.

When anthropologists first started describing mental illness elsewhere, there seemed to be unique illnesses in different cultures. These are referred to as culture-bound syndromes. For example, a mental disorder called *pibloktoq* occurred among some Eskimo adults of Greenland, usually women, who became oblivious to their surroundings and acted in agitated, eccentric ways. They might strip themselves naked and wander across the ice and over hills until they collapsed of exhaustion. Another disorder, amok, occurred in Malaya, Indonesia, and New Guinea, usually among males. It was characterized by John Honigmann as a "destructive maddened excitement . . . beginning with depression and followed by a period of brooding and withdrawal

[culminating in] the final mobilization of tremendous energy during which the 'wild man' runs destructively berserk."67 Anorexia nervosa, the disorder involving aversion to food, may be unique to the relatively few societies that idealize slimness.<sup>68</sup>

Some scholars think that each society's views of personality and concepts of mental illness have to be understood in their own terms. Western understandings and concepts cannot be applied to other cultures. For example, Catherine Lutz suggested that the Western concept of depression cannot be applied to the Pacific island of Ifaluk. The people there have many words for thinking or feeling about "loss and helplessness," but all their words are related to a specific need for someone (such as when someone dies or leaves the island). Such thoughts and feelings of loss are considered perfectly normal, and there is no word in their language for general hopelessness or "depression."<sup>69</sup> Therefore Lutz questioned the applicability of the Western concept of depression as well as other Western psychiatric categories.

Other researchers are not so quick to dismiss the possible universality of psychiatric categories. Some think they have found a considerable degree of cross-cultural uniformity in conceptions of mental illness. Jane Murphy studied descriptions by Eskimos and Yoruba (in Nigeria) of severely disturbed persons. She found that their descriptions not only were similar to each other but also corresponded to North American descriptions of schizophrenia. The Eskimo word for "crazy" is nuthkavihak. They use this word when something inside a person seems to be out of order. Nuthkavihak people are described as talking to themselves, believing themselves to be animals, making strange faces, becoming violent, and so on. The Yoruba have a word *were* for people who are "insane." People described as were sometimes hear voices, laugh when there is nothing to laugh at, and take up weapons and suddenly hit people.70 Robert Edgerton found similarities in conceptions of mental illness in four East African societies. He noted not only that the four groups essentially agreed on the symptoms of psychosis but also that the symptoms they described were the same ones that are considered psychotic here.<sup>71</sup> Edgerton believed that the lack of exact translation in different cultures, such as the one pointed out by Lutz regarding Ifaluk, does not make comparison impossible. If researchers can come to understand another culture's views of personality and the researchers can manage to communicate these views to people of other cultures, we can compare the described cases and try to discover what may be universal and what may be found only in some cultures.<sup>72</sup>

Some mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia and depression, seem so widespread that many researchers think they are probably universal. Still, cultural factors may influence the risk of developing such diseases, the specific symptoms that are expressed, and the effectiveness of different kinds of treatment.<sup>73</sup> There may be some truly culturebound (nearly unique) syndromes, but others thought at one time to be unique may be culturally varying expressions of conditions that occur widely. *Pibloktoq*, for example, may be a kind of hysteria.<sup>74</sup>

Biological factors may be quite important in the etiology of some of the widespread disorders such as schizophrenia.<sup>75</sup> With regard to hysteria, Anthony Wallace theorized that nutritional factors such as calcium deficiency may cause hysteria and that dietary improvement may account for the decline of this illness in the Western world since the nineteenth century.<sup>76</sup> By the early twentieth century, the discovery of the value of good nutrition, coupled with changes in social conditions, had led many people to drink milk, eat vitamin-enriched foods, and spend time in the sun. These changes in diet and activity increased their intake of vitamin D and helped them to maintain a proper calcium level. Concurrently, the number of cases of hysteria declined. Regarding *pibloktoq*, Wallace suggested that a complex set of related variables may cause the disease. The Eskimos live in an environment that supplies only a minimum amount of calcium. A diet low in calcium could result in two different conditions. One condition, rickets, would produce physical deformities potentially fatal in the Eskimos' hunting economy. Persons whose genetic makeup made them prone to rickets would be eliminated from the population through natural selection. A low level of calcium in the blood could also cause muscular spasms known as tetany. Tetany, in turn, may cause emotional and mental disorientation similar to the symptoms of *pibloktoq*. Such attacks last for only a relatively short time and are not fatal, so people who developed *pibloktog* would have a far greater chance of surviving in the Arctic environment with a calcium-deficient diet than would those who had rickets.

Although researchers disagree about the comparability of mental illnesses among cultures, most realize that effective treatment requires understanding a culture's ideas about a mental illness-why it occurs, what treatments are believed to be effective, and how families and others respond to those afflicted.<sup>77</sup>

## PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPLANATIONS OF CULTURAL VARIATION

We have been talking only about societal variation in psychological characteristics and the possible causes of that variation. But psychological anthropologists, as well as other social scientists, have also investigated the possible *consequences* of psychological variation, particularly how psychological characteristics may help us understand certain aspects of cultural variation. For example, David McClelland's research suggests that societies that develop high levels of achievement motivation in individuals (a personality trait) will be likely to experience high rates of economic growth. Economic decline, McClelland suggested, will follow a decline in achievement motivation.<sup>78</sup> Differences in achievement motivation may even have political consequences. For example, Robert LeVine, who studied

achievement motivation in three Nigerian ethnic groups, noted that the entry of one of them (the Ibo) into higher education and into many emerging professions may have been resented by the traditionally more influential groups.<sup>79</sup> Soon after LeVine's book was published, the friction between the rival groups escalated into rebellion by the Ibo and the defeat of a separatist Ibo state named Biafra.

Psychological factors may also help us explain why some aspects of culture are statistically associated with others. Abram Kardiner originally suggested that cultural patterns influence personality development through child training and that the resulting personality characteristics in turn influence the culture. He believed that primary institutions, such as family organization and subsistence techniques, give rise to certain personality characteristics. Once the personality is formed, though, it can have its own impact on culture. In Kardiner's view, the secondary institutions of society, such as religion and art, are shaped by common (he called them basic) personality characteristics. Presumably, these secondary institutions have little relation to the adaptive requirements of the society. But they may reflect and express the motives, conflicts, and anxieties of typical members of the society.<sup>80</sup> Thus, if we can understand why certain typical personality characteristics develop, we might, for example, be able to understand why certain kinds of art are associated with certain kinds of social systems. Whiting and Child used the phrase personality integration of culture to refer to the possibility that an understanding of personality might help us explain connections between primary and secondary institutions.<sup>81</sup> As examples of how personality may integrate culture, we turn to some suggested explanations for cultural preferences in games and for the custom of male initiation ceremonies.

In a cross-cultural study conducted by John Roberts and Brian Sutton-Smith, cultural preferences for particular types of games were found to be related to certain aspects of child rearing. The researchers suggested that these associations are a consequence of conflict generated in many people in a society by particular types of child-rearing pressures. Games of strategy, for example, are associated with child training that emphasizes obedience. Roberts and Sutton-Smith proposed that severe obedience training can create a conflict between the need to obey and the desire not to obey, a conflict that arouses anxiety. Such anxiety may or may not manifest itself against the person who instigates the anxiety. In any event, the conflict and the aggression itself can be played out on the miniature battlefields

Games of strategy, such as this game played in Mali, tend to occur where societies are hierarchical and where obedience is stressed.

of games of strategy such as chess or the Japanese game of go. Similarly, games of chance may represent defiance of societal expectations of docility and responsibility. The general interpretation suggested by Roberts and Sutton-Smith is that players (and societies) initially become curious about games, learn them, and ultimately develop high involvement in them because of the particular kinds of psychological conflicts that are handled or expressed, but not necessarily resolved, by the games.<sup>82</sup>

The possible role of psychological processes in connecting different aspects of culture is also illustrated in cross-cultural work on initiation ceremonies for boys at adolescence. In the ceremonies, boys are subjected to painful tests of manhood, usually including genital operations, which indicate the boys' transition to adulthood. Roger Burton and John Whiting found that initiation ceremonies tend to occur in patrilocal societies in which infant boys initially sleep exclusively with their mothers. They suggest that initiation rites in such societies are intended to break a conflict in sex identity. The conflict is believed to exist because boys in these societies would initially identify with their mothers, who exercise almost complete control over them in infancy. Later, when the boys discover that men dominate the society, they will identify secondarily with their fathers. This sex-role conflict is assumed to be resolved by the initiation ceremony, which demonstrates a boy's manhood, thus strengthening the secondary identification.<sup>83</sup>

In the next two chapters we discuss cultural variation in religion and the arts. In doing so we refer to some psychological explanations. Some researchers feel that such explanations may help us understand why gods in some societies are viewed as mean, why artists in some societies prefer repetitive designs, and why strangers in some societies tend to be the "bad ones" in folktales. It is often assumed by psychological anthropologists that conceptions of gods and artistic creations are not constrained by any objective realities, so people are free to create them as they wish. In other words, people may tend to project their personalities-their feelings, their

conflicts, their concerns—into these areas. This idea of projection underlies what psychologists call **pro**jective tests. In such tests, which presumably reveal personality characteristics, subjects are given stimuli that are purposely ambiguous. So, for example, in the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), subjects are shown vague drawings and asked what they think is going on in them, what happened before, and how they think things will turn out. Because the test materials give few instructions about what to say, it is assumed that subjects will interpret the materials by projecting their own personalities. As we will see, some aspects of religion and the arts may be similar to TAT stories and may express or reflect the common personality characteristics of a society.

## V SUMMARY

1. Psychological anthropologists are interested in the psychological differences and similarities between societies. Their research has focused mainly on four questions: Do all human beings develop psychologically in much the same ways? What may explain the apparent differences in personality characteristics from one society to another? How do people in different societies conceive of personality and psychological development? What kinds of cultural variation might be explained by psychological factors?

2. Early research in psychological anthropology was concerned mainly with how supposedly universal stages of emotional development seem to be affected by cultural differences. Some doubt has been cast on the idea that adolescence is necessarily a time of "storm and stress" and that the Oedipus complex (at least in the form stated by Freud) is universal.

Recent research on universals in psycho-3. logical development has been concerned more with cognitive (intellectual) development. In looking for universals, many researchers have discovered some apparent differences. But most of the tests used in research may favor people in Western cultures and those who attend formal schools.

4. To understand cross-cultural variation in psychological characteristics, many researchers have tried to discover if variation in childrearing customs can account for the observed psychological differences.

5. *Socialization* is a term used by anthropologists and psychologists to describe the development, through the influence of parents and others, of patterns of behavior in children that conform to cultural expectations.

6. Socialization can be direct or indirect. Indirectly, the degree to which parents like children, the kinds of work children are asked to do, and whether children go to school may at least partly influence how children develop psychologically.

7. Anthropologists seek not only to establish connections between child-rearing customs and personality traits but also to learn why those customs originated. Some anthropologists believe societies produce the kinds of personality best suited to performance of the activities necessary for the survival of the society.

8. Anthropologists are also interested in mental illness. Some mental illnesses are believed to be more or less universal, but the ways they are expressed, their frequencies, and the outcomes of treatment may vary from culture to culture. Some syndromes may be unique to some cultures.

Psychological anthropologists are interested not only in the possible causes of psychological differences between societies but also in the possible consequences of psychological variation, particularly how psychological characteristics may help us understand statistical associations between various aspects of culture.
