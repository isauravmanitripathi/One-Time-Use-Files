# Economic Systems

![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg)

When we think of economics, we think of things and activities involving money. We think of the costs of goods and services such as food, rent, haircuts, and movie tickets. We may also think of factories, farms, and other enterprises that produce the goods and services we need or think we need. In our society, workers may stand before a moving belt for eight hours, tightening identical bolts that glide by. For this task they are given bits of paper that may be exchanged for food, shelter, and other goods or services. But many societies (indeed, most that are known to anthropology) did not have money or the equivalent of the factory worker. Still, all societies have economic systems, whether or not these involve the use of money. All societies have customs specifying how people gain access to natural resources; customary ways of transforming or converting those resources, through labor, into necessities and other desired goods and services; and customs for distributing (and perhaps exchanging) goods and services.

As we shall see in this chapter, a great deal of the cross-cultural variation in economic systems is predicted by how a society gets its food. Other aspects of the culture also affect the economic system. These other influences, which we cover in subsequent chapters, include the presence or absence of social (class and gender) inequality, family and kinship groups, and the political system.

# THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES

#### Natural Resources: Land

Every society has access to natural resources—land, water, plants, animals, minerals. Every society has cultural rules for determining who has access to particular resources and what can be done with them. In societies like our own, where land and many other things may be bought and sold, land is divided into precisely measurable units, the borders of which are sometimes invisible. Relatively small plots of land and the resources on them are usually owned by individuals. Large plots of land are generally owned collectively. The owner may be a government agency, such as the National Parks Service, which owns land on behalf of the entire population of the United States. Or the owner may be what we call a corporation—a private collective of shareholders. In the United States, property ownership entails a more or less exclusive right to use land or other resources (called "usufruct") in whatever ways the owner wishes, including the right to withhold or prevent use by others. In the United States and many other societies, property ownership also includes the right to "alienate" property-to sell, give away, bequeath, or destroy the resources owned.

Our system of land allocation is unknown to most food collectors and most horticulturalists, for two reasons. First, in their societies, there is no individual ownership of land or ownership by a group of unrelated shareholders. If there is collective ownership, it is always by groups of related people (kinship groups) or by territorial groups (bands or villages). Second, even if there is collective ownership, such ownership is different from ours in that land is not bought and sold.

Thus, it is society, and not the individual, that specifies what is considered property and what are the rights and duties associated with that property.<sup>1</sup> These specifications are social in nature, for they may be changed over time. For example, France declared all its beaches to be public, thereby stating, in effect, that the ocean shore is not a resource that can be owned by an individual. As a result, all the hotels and individuals that had fenced off portions of the best beaches for their exclusive use had to remove the fences.

In our country, people ask whether abuse of the rights of ownership is a factor in the growing pollution of our air and water. Hence, federal, state, and local governments are becoming more active in regulating exactly what people (and even public agencies) can do with the land they own. Such regulation may be new, but our society has always limited the rights of ownership. For example, land may be taken by the government for use in the construction of a highway; we may be paid compensation, but usually we cannot prevent confiscation. Similarly, we are not allowed to burn our houses, nor can we use them as brothels or munitions arsenals. In short, even under our individualistic system of ownership, property is not entirely private.

How societies differ in their rules for access to land and other natural resources seems to be related in part to how they differ in food-getting. Let us now examine how food collectors, horticulturalists, pastoralists, and intensive agriculturalists structure rights to land in different ways. We examine traditional patterns first. As we shall note later, traditional rights to land have been considerably affected by expanding state societies that have spread to and colonized native societies in the New World, Africa, and Asia.

#### DOES COMMUNAL OWNERSHIP LEAD TO ECONOMIC DISASTER?

A common idea in Western thought is that when land or other resources are held in common, serious damage results because individuals do not see it in their own interest to protect those resources. In a paper called "The Tragedy of the Commons," Garrett Hardin suggested that if animals are grazed on common land it is economically rational for individual animal owners to graze as many animals as possible, since they do not incur the pasture costs. According to Hardin, tragedy results because pasture is degraded by overgrazing and then productivity falls. Similarly, why shouldn't a "fisher" (a person who fishes) take as much fish as possible from the ocean (a kind of commons) and not worry about the consequences? On the other hand, if the resource is privately owned, individuals might try to conserve their resources

because degrading those resources will cost them in the long run by decreasing their yields. The theory then is that, in order to minimize costs and maximize yields, private owners will find it rational to conserve their resources.

Is it really true that communal ownership tends to result in overexploitation of resources and lower yields and private ownership tends to result in conservation of resources and higher yields? We do not have enough studies yet to generalize, but we do know about instances where communal grazing lands have been more productive than private grazing lands in comparable climates. For example, the Borana of Ethiopia, who have communal grazing, produce more animal protein per acre at lower cost than Australian cattle ranches (the climates are similar). And there are instances, such as the overgrazing in the Great American Desert (described in the box titled "The Effect of Food-Getting on the Environment" in the preceding chapter), where private ownership did lead to degradation of the environment.

We have to remember that communal ownership does not mean that anyone can graze their animals or fish at any time. Communities and kin groups often govern rights to pasturage or fishing, and only members of the group have rights of access and use. As we saw in the last chapter, pastoralists such as the Basseri have well-defined, socially arranged travel routes, moving their herds when conditions demand. For traditional pastoralists, mobility is often the key to prevent overgrazing. Similarly, many groups that fish have strict rules regulating access to fishing grounds, and some have "conser-

Food Collectors. As we have noted, members of food-collecting societies generally do not own land individually. The reason is probably that land itself has no intrinsic value for food collectors; what is of value is the presence of game and wild plant life on the land. If game moves away or food resources become less plentiful, the land is less valuable. Therefore, the greater the possibility that the wild food supply in a particular locale will fluctuate, the less desirable it is to parcel out small areas of land to individuals and the more advantageous it is to make land ownership communal. The Hadza of Tanzania, for example, do not believe that they have exclusive

rights over the land on which they hunt. Any member of the group can hunt, gather, or draw water wherever he or she likes.<sup>2</sup>

Although food collectors rarely practice anything resembling individual ownership of land or other resources, there is considerable variation in the extent of communal "ownership." In some societies, such as the Hadza, groups do not claim or defend particular territories. In fact, the Hadza do not even restrict use of their land to members of their own language group. Even though outsiders have steadily intruded on Hadza territory recently, such encroachment has not been protested. But the vation" rules as well. For example, the Palauans of Micronesia usually allow only members of a cluster of villages to fish in the adjacent lagoon waters inside the fringing reef. Traditionally, people took only what they could eat, and there were "laws" governing the times that people could fish for certain species.

Restricted access to communal property may be the main way that pastoralists and fishers prevent degradation of their environment. Some groups, such as the Palauans, clearly also have conservation rules. But we do not know how many pastoralists and fishers have such rules. For example, the Ponam of New Guinea do not appear to conserve fish resources, even though they restrict access to their communal fishing territories. They do value the prestige associated with generosity, and consequently they try to collect more fish than they need in order to give some away.

Development and commer-

cialization may be more important than private versus communal ownership in leading to overgrazing or overfishing, at least initially. In Palau, which had traditional conservation practices, serious overfishing became a problem apparently only when people started to sell fish to Japanese colonists for imported trade goods. Some of those goods (e.g., nets and motors) helped to make fishing easier. Eventually, overfishing resulted in reduced catches and increased costs of fishing, and the Palauans had to buy much of their fish in imported cans. In arid areas of the Sahel in Africa, development may have led to pastoral overgrazing. Boreholes were built by development agencies to increase the water supply, but this practice often made people reluctant to move to new grazing land, so local land was overgrazed. In addition, the development of irrigation agriculture nearby decreased the amount of land available for pasturage.

So which is more likely in general to lead to conservationcommunal ownership or private ownership? We cannot say yet. We need more systematic comparisons, of many cases of the two types of system, to tell us.

Hadza are somewhat unusual—it is more common in food-collecting societies for a group of individuals (usually kin) to "own" land. To be sure, such ownership is not usually exclusive; typically some degree of access is provided to members of neighboring bands.<sup>3</sup>

At the other extreme, local groups in some foraging societies try to maintain exclusive rights to particular territories. The Owens Valley Paiute in the California part of the Great Basin lived all year in permanent villages along streams. A group of villagers claimed and defended a particular territory against intruders, who may or may not have been other Owens Valley Paiute. Why have some food collectors been more territorial than others? One suggestion is that when the plants and animals collected are predictably located and abundant, groups are more likely to be sedentary and to try to maintain exclusive control over territories. In contrast, when plant and animal resources are unpredictable in location or amount, territoriality will tend to be minimal.<sup>4</sup> Territorial food collectors appear to have predictably located resources and more permanent villages, so it is hard to know which is more important in determining whether territory will be defended.

Horticulturalists. Like food collectors, most horticulturalists do not have individual or family ownership of land. This may be because rapid depletion of the soil necessitates letting some of the land lie fallow for a period of years or abandoning an area after a few years and moving to a new location. There is no reason for individuals or families to claim permanent access to land that, given their technology, is not usable permanently. But unlike food collectors, horticulturalists do allocate particular plots of land to individuals or families for their use, although these individuals or families do not own the land in our sense of potentially permanent ownership.

Among the Mundurucu of Brazil, the village controls the rights to use land. People in the community can hunt and fish where they like, and they have the right to clear a garden plot wherever land belonging to the community is not being used. Gardens can be cultivated for only two years before the soil is exhausted; the land then reverts to the community. The Mundurucu distinguish between the land and the produce on the land, so that a person who cultivates the land owns the produce. (Similarly, the person who kills an animal or catches a fish owns it, no matter where it was obtained.) But, because all food is shared with others, it does not really matter who owns it. Rights to land became more individualized when Mundurucu men began to tap rubber trees for sale. Rights to a particular path in the forest (where trees were tapped) could not be bought and sold, but the rights could be inherited by a son or son-in-law.<sup>5</sup>

The territory of pastoral nomads far Pastoralists. exceeds that of most horticultural societies. Since their wealth ultimately depends upon two elements-mobile herds and fixed pasturage and water-pastoralists must combine the adaptive potential of both food collectors and horticulturalists. Like food collectors, they must know the potential of their territory—which can extend as much as 1,000 miles—so that they are assured a constant supply of grass and water. And, like horticulturalists, after their herds graze an area clean they must move on and let that land lie fallow until the grass renews itself. Also like horticulturalists, they depend for subsistence on human manipulation of a natural resource—animals, as opposed to the horticulturalists' land.

Although grazing land tends to be communally held, it is customary among pastoralists for animals to be owned by individuals.<sup>6</sup> Fredrik Barth argued that if animals were not so owned, the whole group might be in trouble because the members might be tempted to eat up their productive capital-their animals-in bad times. When animals are owned individually, a family whose herd drops below the minimum number of animals necessary for survival must drop out of nomadic life, at least temporarily, and work for wages in sedentary agricultural communities. But in so doing, such a family does not jeopardize other pastoral families. On the other hand, if the fortunate were to share their herds with the unfortunate, all might approach bankruptcy. Thus, Barth argued, individual ownership is adaptive for a pastoral way of life.7

John Dowling questioned that interpretation. As he pointed out, pastoral nomads are not the only ones who have to save some of their "crop" for future production. Horticulturalists must save some of their crop (in the form of seeds or tubers) for future planting. But horticulturalists generally lack private ownership of productive resources, so the necessity to save for future production cannot explain private ownership of animals in pastoral societies. Dowling suggested that private ownership will develop only in pastoral societies that depend on selling their products to nonpastoralists.<sup>8</sup> Thus, it may be the opportunity to sell their products as well as their labor that explains both the possibility of dropping out of nomadic life and the private ownership of animals among most pastoralists.

Intensive Agriculturalists. Individual ownership of land resources—including the right to use the resources and the right to sell or otherwise dispose of them-is common among intensive agriculturalists. The development of such ownership is partly a result of the possibility of using land season after season, which gives the land more or less permanent value. But the concept of individual ownership is also partly a political and social matter. So, for example, the occupation and cultivation of frontier land in the United States was transformed by law into individual ownership. Under the Homestead Act of 1862, if a person cleared a 160-acre piece of land and farmed it for five years, the federal government would consider that person the owner of the land. This practice is similar to the custom in some societies by which a kin group, a chief, or a community is obligated to assign a parcel of land to anyone who wishes to farm it. The difference is that once the American homesteader had become the owner of the land, the laws of this country gave the homesteader the right to dispose of it at will by selling or giving it away. Once individual ownership of land has become established, property owners may use their economic, and hence political, power to pass

laws that favor themselves. In the early years of the United States, only property owners could vote.

Private individual ownership is usually associated with intensive agriculture, but not always. As we mentioned in the preceding chapter, intensive agriculture is usually associated with more complex political systems and with differences in wealth and power, so we need to understand the larger political and social context in order to fully understand particular systems of land allocation. For example, under the feudal and manor system in much of medieval Europe, land and protection were granted by a higher aristocrat to a lower aristocrat (vassal) in exchange for military service and other obligations. If the vassal had no heirs, the land reverted to the higher aristocrat. Most of the farming was done by commoners-tenants and serfs. Tenants were granted land by the lord of a manor in return for labor, a portion of the crops, and military service when needed. Tenancy could be passed on to the children, and tenants technically were free to leave, but it was not easy to leave. Serfs, who had similar obligations to the lord of the manor, were bound to the land and could not leave, but neither could they be ejected.

In recent times, some of the communist and socialist nations with intensive agriculture formed agricultural collectives. For example, after World War II, the small-farm holdings in a village in Bulgaria named Zamfirovo were incorporated into a village cooperative. Most of the villagers worked as laborers on the new cooperative, but every household was allocated a small plot by the cooperative on which to grow its own grain, vegetables, and grapes. These plots were fairly productive, and Westerners often attributed their productivity to private enterprise. But the cooperative provided much of the labor needed to plant and plow these plots, so they could hardly be considered private property. In 1989, after the overthrow of the Communist regime, the cooperative was dissolved; the land was divided and sold to private owners.<sup>9</sup>

In the United States and other capitalist societies, it may appear that private property owners have nearly absolute control over the use and disposal of their property. But the nearly absolute control is offset by the real absoluteness with which the owner can lose that property. In our society, the government can take a person's property as the penalty for inability to pay taxes. A lienholder can take it to satisfy a debt. Or the government can decide to take the property for some public purpose (usually with some compensation to the owner) under the right of eminent domain. A family that has farmed its land for a century can lose it in one year. Often, families lose property because of events over which they have no control-a national economic depression, a drought that causes a bad crop year, or a period of economic stagnation such as the one that followed the Civil War. In addition, where individual owership is the custom, it is nearly always the case that some individuals do not own any land.

Colonialism and Natives' Control Over Land. Almost universally around the world, colonial conquerors and settlers have taken land away from the natives or aborigines. Even if the natives were given other land in exchange, as in Brazil and the United States in the last few hundred years, these reservations were often, if not always, poorer in potential

In societies with intensive agriculture, private ownership of land is common. The boundaries, as on this Minnesota farm, are usually clearly marked.

than the original land. (If the reservation land hadn't been poorer in quality, the settlers would have taken it for themselves.) In addition, the new centralized governments often tried to change how land was owned by the natives, almost always in the direction of individual or private ownership. If kin groups or larger social entities owned the land, it would be more difficult for the settlers to get the natives to give it up, either by sale or threat. Owners who were individuals could be dispossessed more easily.<sup>10</sup>

The newcomers who benefitted from these forced changes were not always people of European background, but they were always people from expanding state societies. Beginning in the late fifteenth century, the expanding groups came mostly from Western Europe. But in recent times (as well as in the millenia before and after the time of Christ), conquerors and settlers have come from India, China, Japan, Arabia, Scandinavia, Russia, and other countries. This is not to say that native peoples in Africa, Asia, and the New World were never guilty of conquering and exploiting others on their continents or elsewhere. They were. The Aztecs in Mexico and Central America, the native kingdoms in West Africa after about 800 years ago, and the Arabs after the rise of Islam were just some of the expanding state societies of the past, before the rise of the West. Wherever there have been "civilized" (urban) societies, there has been imperialism and colonialism.

In North America, the British recognized the principle that lands not ceded to the crown would be Indian hunting grounds, but such recognition of rights by the British and then by the United States remained in force only as long as the various Indian groups remained numerous enough to constitute a threat to the settlers. President Andrew Jackson, for example, called for a removal of all eastern Native American groups to "permanent" settlements west of the Mississippi. Some 90,000 people were removed. But as settlers moved west, native reservations were often reduced in size. Government agents usually assumed that "communal" forms of ownership were detrimental to progress and enacted laws to assign land to individuals.<sup>11</sup> In much of colonial Africa, governments ceded land to European-owned companies for development. Reserves were established for large native populations, who then were invariably forced to work as laborers on Europeanowned plantations and in European-owned mines. In Kenya, for example, Europeans who constituted less then 1 percent of the population acquired access to or control of 20 percent of the land, mostly in the highlands, where there was the greatest potential for commercial production of tea and coffee.<sup>12</sup>

# Technology

In order to convert resources to food and other goods, every society makes use of a technology, which includes tools, constructions (such as fish traps), and required skills (such as how and where to set up a fish trap). Societies vary considerably in their technologies and in the way access to technology is allocated. For example, food collectors and pastoralists typically have fairly small tool kits; they must limit their tools (and their material possessions in general) to what they can comfortably carry with them. As for access to technology, food collectors and horticulturalists generally allow equal opportunity. In the absence of specialization, most individuals have the skills to make what they need. But in an industrial society like our own, the opportunity to acquire or use a particular technology (which may be enormously expensive as well as complex) is hardly available to all. Most of us may be able to buy a drill or a hammer, but few of us can buy the factory that makes it.

The tools most needed by food collectors are weapons for the hunt, digging sticks, and receptacles for gathering and carrying. Most hunters know the bow and arrow; Andaman Islanders used them exclusively for hunting game and large fish. Australian aborigines developed two types of boomerangs: a heavy one for a straight throw in killing game and a light, returning one for playing games or for scaring birds into nets strung between trees. The Semang of Malaya used poisoned darts and blowguns. The Mbuti Pygmies of Zaire still trap elephants and buffalo in deadfalls and nets. Of all food collectors, the Inuit probably had the most sophisticated weapons, including harpoons, compound bows, and ivory fishhooks. Yet the Inuit also had relatively fixed settlements with available storage space and dog teams and sleds for transportation.<sup>13</sup>

Among food collectors, tools are considered to belong to the person who made them. There is no way of gaining superiority over others through possession of tools, because whatever resources for toolmaking are available to one are available to all. In addition, the custom of sharing applies to tools as well as to food. For example, Elizabeth M. Thomas, speaking of the !Kung said, "the few possessions that Bushmen have are constantly circulating among the members of their groups."14

Pastoralists, like food collectors, are somewhat limited in their possessions, for they too are

nomadic. But pastoralists can use their animals to carry some possessions. Each family owns its own tools, clothes, and perhaps a tent, as well as its own livestock. The livestock are the source of other needed articles, for the pastoralists often trade their herd products for the products of the townspeople.

Horticulturalists, on the other hand, are more self-sufficient than pastoralists. The knife for slashing and the hoe or stick for digging are their principal farming tools. What a person makes is considered his or her own, yet everyone is often obligated to lend tools to others. In Truk society, the owner of a canoe has first use of it. The same is true for farming implements. Yet if a close relative needs the canoe and finds it unused, it may be taken without permission. A distant relative or neighbor must ask permission to borrow any tools, but the owner may not refuse. If owners were to refuse, they would risk being scorned and refused if they were to need tools later.

Societies with intensive agriculture and industrialized societies are likely to have tools made by specialists-which means that tools must be acquired by trade or purchase. Probably because complex tools cost a considerable amount of money, they are less likely than simple tools to be shared except by those who contributed to the purchase price. For example, a diesel-powered combine requires a large amount of capital for its purchase and upkeep. The person who has supplied the capital is likely to regard the machine as individual private property and to regulate its use and disposal. Farmers may not have the capital to purchase the machine they need, so they may have to borrow from a bank. The owner must then use the machine to produce enough surplus to pay for its cost and upkeep as well as for its replacement. The owner may rent the machine to neighboring farmers during slack periods to obtain a maximum return on his or her investment.

Expensive equipment, however, is not always individually owned in societies with intensive agriculture or industrialized economies. Even in capitalist countries, there may be collective ownership of machines by "cooperatives" or co-owning with neighbors.<sup>15</sup>

Some equipment and facilities are too expensive for even a cooperative to afford. Governments may then allocate tax money collected from all the population for constructions or facilities that benefit some productive group as well as the public: airports benefit airlines and travelers; highways benefit truckers, commuters, and travelers; dams benefit power and water companies as well as the consumers of water. Such resources are owned collectively by the whole society. Rights of use depend on the facility. Anyone can use a highway, but only municipalities can draw upon the water in a dam. Other productive resources in industrial societies, such as factories or service companies, may be owned jointly by shareholders, who purchase a portion of a corporation's assets in return for a proportionate share of its earnings. The proportion of technology and facilities owned by various levels of government also reflects the type of political-economic system: socialist and communist countries have more public ownership than capitalist countries.

# THE CONVERSION OF RESOURCES

In all societies, resources have to be transformed or converted through labor into food, tools, and other goods. (These activities constitute what economists call *production*.) In this section, after briefly reviewing different types of production, we examine what may motivate people to work, how societies may divide up the work to be done, and how they may organize work. As we shall see, some aspects of the conversion of natural resources are culturally universal, but there is also an enormous amount of cultural variation.

#### **Types of Economic Production**

At least at the times they were first described, most of the societies known to anthropology had a do*mestic* (family or kinship) mode of production. People labored to get food and to produce shelter and implements for themselves and their kin. Usually families had the right to exploit productive resources and controlled the products of their labor. Even part-time specialists, such as potters, could still support themselves without that craft if they needed to. At the other extreme are industrial societies, where much of the work is based on mechanized production (as in factories, but also in mechanized agriculture). Because machines and materials are so costly, only some individuals (capitalists), corporations, or governments can afford the expenses of production. Therefore, most people in industrial societies labor for others as wage earners. Although wages can buy food, people out of work can easily lose their ability to support themselves (unless they are protected by welfare payments or unemployment insurance). Then there is the *tribu*tary type of production system, found in nonindustrial societies in which most people can still produce their own food but an elite or aristocracy controls a portion of production (including the products of specialized crafts). The feudal societies of medieval western Europe were examples, as was czarist Russia under serfdom.<sup>16</sup>

Many people have suggested that our own and other developed economies are now moving from industrialism to postindustrialism. In many areas of commerce, computers have radically transformed the workplace. Computers "drive" machines and robots, and much of the manual work required in industry is disappearing. Businesses are now more knowledge- and service-oriented. Information is more accessible with telecommunication, so much so that telecommuting has entered our vocabulary to describe how many people can now work (for wages) at home. This economic transformation has important implications for both home life and the workplace. With inexpensive home computers and speedy data transmission by telephone and otherwise, more and more people can work at home. In addition, when information and knowledge become more important than capital equipment, more and more people can own and have access to the productive resources of society.<sup>17</sup> If who owns what partly determines who has political and other influence, the wider ownership of resources that is possible in postindustrial society may eventually translate into new, more democratic political forms and processes.

# Incentives for Labor

Why do people work? Probably all of us have asked ourselves this question at least once in a while. Our concern may not be why other people are working, but why we have to work. Clearly, part of the answer is that work is necessary for survival. Although there are always some able-bodied adults who do not work as much as they should and rely on the work of others, no society would survive if most ablebodied adults were like that. In fact, most societies probably succeed in motivating most people to want to do (and even enjoy) what they have to do. But are the incentives for labor the same in all societies? Anthropologists think the answer is yes and no. One reason people may work is because they must. But why do people in some societies apparently work *more* than they must? We can be fairly certain that a particular and often-cited motivethe profit motive, or the desire to exchange something for more than it costs-is not universal or always the dominant motive.

There can be no profit motive among people who produce food and other goods primarily for their own consumption, as do most food collectors, many if not most horticulturalists, and even some intensive agriculturalists. Such societies have what we call a subsistence economy, not a money or commercial economy. Anthropologists have noticed that people in subsistence economies (with a domestic mode of production) often work less than people in commercial economies (with tributary or industrial modes of production). Indeed, food collectors appear to have a considerable amount of leisure time, as do many horticulturalists. It has been estimated, for example, that the men of the horticultural Kuikuru tribe in central Brazil spend about three and a half hours a day on subsistence. It appears that the Kuikuru could produce a substantial surplus of manioc, their staple food, by working thirty minutes more a day.<sup>18</sup> Yet they and many other peoples do not produce more than they need. Why should they? They cannot store a surplus for long because it would rot; they cannot sell it because there is no market nearby; and they do not have a political authority that might collect it for some purpose. Although we often think "more is better," a food-getting strategy with such a goal might even be disastrous, especially for food collectors. The killing of more animals than a group could eat might seriously jeopardize the food supply in the future, because overhunting could reduce reproduction among the hunted animals.<sup>19</sup> Horticulturalists might do well to plant a little extra, just in case part of the crop failed, but a great deal extra would be a tremendous waste of time and effort.

It has been suggested that when resources are converted primarily for household consumption, people will work harder if they have more consumers in the household. That is, when there are few ablebodied workers and a proportionately large number of consumers (perhaps because there are many young children and old people), the workers have to work harder. But when there are proportionately more workers, they can work less. This idea is called Chayanov's rule.<sup>20</sup> Alexander Chayanov found this relationship in data on rural Russians before the Communist revolution.<sup>21</sup> But it appears to work in other places too. For example, Michael Chibnik found support for Chayanov's rule when he compared data from twelve communities in five areas of the world (the communities ranged in complexity from New Guinea horticulturalists to commercial Swiss farmers). Although Chayanov restricted his theory to farmers who mostly produce for their own consumption and do not hire labor, Chibnik's analysis suggests that Chayanov's rule applies even where labor is often hired.<sup>22</sup>

But there appear to be many societies, even with subsistence economies, in which some people work harder than they need to just for their own families' subsistence. What motivates them to work harder? It turns out that many subsistence economies are not oriented just to household consumption. Rather, sharing and other transfers of food and goods often go well beyond the household, sometimes including the whole community or even groups of communities, as we will see later in the chapter. In such societies, social rewards come to those who are generous, who give things away. Thus, people who work harder than they have to for subsistence may be motivated to do so because they gain respect or esteem thereby.<sup>23</sup> In many societies too, as we shall see in subsequent chapters, extra food and goods may be needed at times for special purposes and occasions; goods and services may be needed to arrange and celebrate marriages, to form alliances, and to perform rituals and ceremonies (including what we would call sporting events). Thus, how the culture defines what one works for and what is needed may go beyond what is necessary.

In commercial economies such as our own where foods, other goods, and services are sold and bought—people seem to be motivated to keep any extra income for themselves and their families. Extra income is converted into bigger dwellings, more expensive furnishings and food, and other elements of a "higher" standard of living. But the desire to improve one's standard of living is probably not the only motive operating. Some people may work partly to satisfy a need for achievement,<sup>24</sup> or because they find their work enjoyable. In addition, just as in precommercial societies, some people may work partly to gain respect or influence by giving some of their income away. Not only do we respect philanthropists and movie stars for giving to charities; our society encourages such giving by making it an allowable tax deduction! Still, the emphasis on giving in commercial societies is clearly less developed than in subsistence economies. We consider charity by the religious (or rich) appropriate and even admirable, but we would think it foolish or crazy for people to give so much away that they became poverty-stricken.

#### Forced Labor

Thus far we have mostly discussed *voluntary labor* voluntary in the sense that no formal organization within the society compels people to work and punishes them for not working. Social training and social pressure are powerful enough to persuade an individual to perform some useful task. In both food-collecting and horticultural societies, individuals who can stand being the butt of jokes about laziness will still be fed. At most, they will be ignored by the other members of the group. There is no reason to punish them and no way to coerce them to do the work expected of them.

More complex societies have ways of forcing people to work for the authorities—whether those authorities be kings or presidents. An indirect form of forced labor is taxation. In 1989, the average tax in the United States (local, state, and federal) was 34 percent of income, which means that the average person worked four months out of the year for the government. (It's about the same now.) If a person decides not to pay the tax, the money will be forcibly taken or the person can be put in prison.

Money is the customary form of tax payment in a commercial society. In a politically complex but nonmonetary society, persons may pay their taxes in other ways-by performing a certain number of hours of labor or by giving up a certain percentage of what they produce. The corvée, a system of required labor, existed in the Inca empire in the central Andes before the Spanish conquest. Each male commoner was assigned three plots of land to work: a temple plot, a state plot, and his own plot. The enormous stores of food that went into state warehouses were used to supply the nobles, the army, the artisans, and all other state employees. If labor became overabundant, the people were still kept occupied; it is said that one ruler had a hill moved to keep some laborers busy. In addition to subsistence work for the state, Inca commoners were subject to military service, to duty as personal servants for the nobility, and to other "public" service.<sup>25</sup>

Another example of forced labor is tenant farming. In return for a house or shack and some acreage to farm, the tenant farmer owes a portion of the harvest to the owner. By manipulating the price for the tenant's crop, by making cash loans to the tenant at high interest rates, and by providing a store at which the tenant must buy staple goods at exorbitant prices, the owner manages to keep the tenant working the farm as economically forced labor. If the tenant farmer tries to leave without paying the debts engineered by the owner, the owner can use the power of the state to make him pay. On the other hand, if the tenant farmer becomes obsolete through the introduction of mechanized farming, the owner can use the power of the state to make him leave. Non-farm workers can also find it difficult to leave or quit in "company towns," whether they be in developing countries or in our own country. Access to supplies and housing may be so controlled by the

company that people have little choice but to accept inferior conditions of work and living.

The draft or compulsory military service is a form of corvée, in that a certain period of service is required and failure to serve can be punished by a prison term or involuntary exile. Emperors of China had soldiers drafted to defend their territory and had the Great Wall built along the northern borders of the empire. The wall extends over 1,500 miles, and thousands were drafted to work on it.

Slavery is the most extreme form of forced work, in that slaves have little control over their labor. Because slaves constitute a category or class of persons in many societies, we discuss slavery more fully in the chapter on social stratification.

#### Division of Labor

All societies have some division of labor—some customary assignment of different kinds of work to different kinds of people. Universally, males and females and adults and children do not do the same kinds of work. In a sense, then, division of labor by gender and age is a kind of universal specialization of labor. Many societies known to anthropology divide labor only by gender and age. Other societies, as we will see, have more complex specialization.

By Gender and Age. All societies make use of gender differences to some extent in their customary assignment of labor. In the chapter on sex, gender,

![](_page_10_Picture_8.jpeg)

In many societies children do a great deal of work. Here a young Mamvu girl in Zaire is minding her twoyear-old sibling.

and culture, we discuss the division of labor by gender in detail.

Age is also a universal basis for division of labor. Clearly, children cannot do work that requires a great deal of strength. But in many societies girls and boys contribute much more in labor than do children in our own society. For example, they help in animal tending, weeding, and harvesting, and they do a variety of domestic chores such as child care, fetching water and firewood, and cooking and cleaning. Indeed, in some societies a child six years old is considered old enough to be responsible for a younger sibling for a good part of the day.<sup>26</sup> Animal tending is often important work for children. Children in some societies spend more time at this task than adults.<sup>27</sup>

Why do children do so much work in some societies? If adults (particularly mothers) have heavy workloads, and children are physically and mentally able to do the work, a good part of the work is likely to be assigned to children.<sup>28</sup> As we have seen, food producers probably have more work than food collectors, so we would expect that children would be likely to work more where there is herding and farming. Consistent with this expectation, Patricia Draper and Elizabeth Cashdan found differences in children's work between nomadic and settled !Kung. Even though recently settled !Kung have not switched completely from food collection to food production, children's (as well as adults') activities have changed considerably. The children living in nomadic camps had virtually no work at all—adults did all the gathering and hunting. But the settled children were given lots of chores ranging from helping with animals to helping with the harvest and food processing.<sup>29</sup> When children in a society do a great deal of work, parents may value them more and may consciously want to have more children.<sup>30</sup> This may be one of the reasons birth rates are high in intensive agricultural societies.<sup>31</sup>

In some societies, work groups are formally organized on the basis of age. Among the Nyakyusa of southeastern Africa, for example, cattle are the principal form of wealth, and boys six to eleven years old herd the cattle for their parents' village. The boys join together in herding groups to tend the cattle of their fathers and of any neighboring families that do not have a son of herding age.<sup>32</sup>

Beyond Gender and Age. In societies with relatively simple technologies, there is little specialization of labor beyond that of gender and age. But as a society's technology becomes more complex and it is able to produce large quantities of food, more and more of its people are freed from subsistence work to become specialists in some other tasks-canoe builders, weavers, priests, potters, artists, and the like.

In contrast with food collectors, horticultural societies may have some part-time specialists. Some people may devote special effort to perfecting a particular skill or craft—pottery making, weaving, house building, doctoring-and in return for their products or services be given food or other gifts. Among some horticultural groups, the entire village may partially specialize in making a particular product, which can then be traded to neighboring people.

With the development of intensive agriculture, full-time specialists-potters, weavers, blacksmiths -- begin to appear. The trend toward greater specialization reaches its peak in industrialized societies, where workers develop skills in one small area of the economic system. The meaninglessness and dehumanizing effect of much of industrialized work was depicted by Charlie Chaplin in the film Modern Times: when he left the factory after repeatedly tightening the same kind of bolt all day long, he could not stop his arms from moving, as if they were still tightening bolts.

In societies with full-time occupational specialization, different jobs are usually associated with differences in prestige, wealth, and power, as we shall see in the next chapter, on social stratification.

#### The Organization of Labor

The degree to which labor has to be organized reaches its peak in industrial societies, which have great occupational specialization and complex political organization. The coordination required to produce an automobile on an assembly line is obvious; so is the coordination required to collect taxes from every wage earner.

In many food-collecting and horticultural societies there is little formal organization of work. Work groups tend to be organized only when productive work requires it and to dissolve when they are no longer needed. Furthermore, the groups so organized often have changing composition and leadership; participation tends to be individualistic and voluntary.<sup>33</sup> Perhaps this flexibility is possible because when virtually everyone has the same work to do, little instruction is needed and almost anyone can assume leadership. Still, some types of work require more organization than others. Hunting big game usually requires coordinated efforts by a large number of hunters; so might catching fish in large nets. For example, on Moala, a Fijian island in the Pacific, net fishing is a group affair. Saturday is the most popular day for communal netting: a party of twenty to thirty women wade out on the reef and make a semicircle of nets. At a signal from an experienced woman, usually the chief's wife, the women move together at the ends, forming a circle. After the fish are caught in the nets, the women bite them on the backs of their heads to kill them and put them in baskets that they carry ashore. A larger fish drive is undertaken by the village, or several villages, around Christmas. The day before, more than 100 people make a "sweep," some 1,600 yards long, from coconut fronds. The next day, the men, women, and children all participate in the surround, catching thousands of fish.<sup>34</sup>

Kinship ties are an important basis for work organization, particularly in nonindustrial societies. For example, among the horticultural Kapauku of western New Guinea, the male members of a village are a kin group, and all work together to build drainage ditches, large fences, and bridges.<sup>35</sup> Among the pastoral Somali of eastern Africa, a herding

![](_page_12_Picture_0.jpeg)

Specialization is more likely in a society that practices intensive agriculture, as among the Huichol of Mexico whose specialists include weavers.

group may consist of brothers, their sons, and all wives, unmarried daughters, and small children. Members of the tribe who decided to settle on farmland apportioned within the British protectorate of Somaliland did so as larger kin groups, not as individuals. As a result, the former cooperating pastoral kin groups became equally cooperative farming villages, depending on kin affiliation for land and other forms of economic help.<sup>36</sup>

With increasing technological complexity, the basis of work organization begins to shift to more formally organized groups. Such a shift usually entails an enforced obligation to participate.<sup>37</sup> Societies with complex political organization, particularly centralized or "state" organization, usually have the power to compel others to work. The power of the state may be employed specifically to draft labor for the construction of public works and buildings, or it may be more generalized, as when the law allows slave owners to compel slaves to work.<sup>38</sup> In our type of industrial society, work is sometimes politically organized, but the predominant basis of organization is the contract-the agreement between employers and employees whereby the latter perform a specified amount of work for a specified amount of wages. Although the arrangement may be entered into voluntarily, laws and the power of the state enforce the obligation of the parties to abide by the contract.

#### Making Decisions about Work

Food collectors ignore many of the plant and animal species in their environment, choosing to go after only some. Why? The people may say that some animals are taboo whereas others are delicious. But where do such customary beliefs come from? Are they adaptive? And if there are no customary preferences for certain plants and animals, how can we explain why a food collector will go after certain foods and ignore others on a particular day? Food producers also make choices constantly. For example, a farmer has to decide when to plant, what to plant, how much to plant, when to harvest, how much to store, how much to give away or sell. Researchers have recently tried to explain why certain economic decisions become customary and why individuals make certain economic choices in their everyday lives.

A frequent source of ideas about choices is optimal foraging theory, which was developed originally by students of animal behavior and which

has been applied to decision making by food collectors. Optimal foraging theory assumes that individuals seek to maximize the returns (in calories and nutrients) on their labor in deciding which animals and plants to hunt or collect. Natural selection should favor optimal foraging because "good" decisions would increase the chances of survival and reproduction. Research in different food-collecting societies supports the optimal foraging model.<sup>39</sup> For example, the Aché of eastern Paraguay consistently prefer to hunt peccaries (wild piglike mammals) rather than armadillos. Although peccaries take much longer to find and are harder to kill than armadillos, a day spent hunting peccaries yields more than 4,600 calories per hour of work, whereas hunting armadillos yields only about 1,800 calories an hour.<sup>40</sup> Other factors in addition to calorie yield, such as predictability of resources, may also influence which foods are collected. For example, the !Kung of the Kalahari desert depend largely on mongongo nuts, even though these nuts yield fewer calories per hour of work than does meat. But mongongo nuts in season are more dependable than game is. Once a group of !Kung hike to a grove of ripe mongongo nuts, they know they can obtain food there until the supply is exhausted; they are not as certain of getting game if they leave.<sup>41</sup>

How does a farmer decide whether to plant a particular crop and how much land and labor to devote to it? Christina Gladwin and others suggested that farmers make decisions in steps, with each choice point involving a yes or no answer. For example, in the high-altitude region of Guatemala, farmers could choose to plant about eight possible crops (or combinations of them, such as corn and beans, which grow together well). A farmer will quickly exclude some choices because of the answers to certain questions: Can I afford the seed and fertilizer? Can this crop be watered adequately? Is the altitude appropriate? And so on. If any of the answers is no, the crop is not planted. By a further series of yes or no decisions, farmers presumably decide which of the remaining possibilities will be planted.42

Individuals may not always be able to state clearly their rules for making decisions nor do they always have complete knowledge about the various possibilities, particularly when some of the possibilities are new. That does not mean, however, that economic choices cannot be predicted or explained by researchers. For example, Michael Chibnik found that men in two villages in Belize (in Central America) were not able to say why they devoted more or less time to working for wages versus growing crops. But their behavior was still predictable. For example, older men grew crops more, because wage labor was more physically demanding; and in the village with a higher cost of living the men were more likely to work for wages.<sup>43</sup>

# THE DISTRIBUTION OF GOODS AND SERVICES

Goods and services are distributed in all societies by systems that, however varied, can be classified under three general types: reciprocity, redistribution, and market or commercial exchange.<sup>44</sup> The three systems often coexist in a society, but one system usually predominates. The predominant system seems to be associated with the society's foodgetting technology and, more specifically, its level of economic development.

### Reciprocity

Reciprocity consists of giving and taking without the use of money; it ranges from pure gift giving to equal exchanges to cheating. Technically, then, reciprocity may take three forms: generalized reciprocity, balanced reciprocity, and negative reciprocity.45

Generalized Reciprocity. When goods or services are given to another, without any apparent expectation of a return gift, we call it generalized reciprocity. Generalized reciprocity sustains the family in all societies. Parents give food, clothing, and labor to children because they want to (or perhaps feel obliged to), but they do not usually calculate exactly how their children will reciprocate years later. In this sense, all societies have some kind of generalized reciprocity. But some societies depend on it almost entirely to distribute goods and services.

Lorna Marshall recounted how the !Kung divided an eland brought to a site where five bands and several visitors were camping together-more than 100 people in all. The owner of the arrow that had first penetrated the eland was, by custom, the owner of the meat. He first distributed the forequarters to the two hunters who had aided him in the kill. After that, the distribution depended on kinship: each hunter shared with his wives' parents, wives, children, parents, and siblings, and they in turn shared with their kin. Sixty-three gifts of raw meat were recorded, after which further sharing of raw and cooked meat was begun.

The !Kung distribution of large game, clearly generalized reciprocity, is common among foragers. But giving away is not limited to game. For example, when Marshall left the band that had sponsored her in 1951, she gave each woman in the band a present of enough cowrie shells to make a necklace—one large shell and twenty small ones. When she returned in 1952, there were no cowrie-shell necklaces and hardly a single shell among the people in the band. Instead, the shells appeared by ones and twos in the ornaments of the people of neighboring bands.<sup>46</sup>

Although generalized reciprocity may appear to be altruistic or unselfish, researchers have suggested that giving may in fact benefit the givers in various ways. For example, parents who help their children may not only perpetuate their genes (the ultimate biological benefit) but may also be likely when they are old to receive care and affection from their grown-up children. And giving parents may be happier and enjoy life more than nongiving parents. So, in the shorter as well as longer run, givers may derive economic and psychological benefits, in addition to reproductive benefits.

Parent-child giving may seem easy to understand, but giving beyond the family is more of a problem. Why do some societies rely more on generalized reciprocity than others, particularly beyond the family? Sharing may be most likely when people are not sure they can get the food and water they need. In other words, sharing may be most likely if resources are unpredictable. So a !Kung band may share its water with other bands because they may have water now but not in the future. A related group in the Kalahari, the G//ana,<sup>47</sup> has been observed to share less than other groups. It turns out that the resources available to the G//ana are more predictable, because the G//ana supplement their hunting and gathering with plant cultivation and goat herding. Cultivated melons (which store water) appear to buffer the G//ana against water shortages, and goats appear to buffer them against shortages of game. Thus, whereas the !Kung distribute the meat right after a kill, the G//ana dry it and then store it in their houses.<sup>48</sup>

The idea that unpredictability favors sharing may also explain why some foods are more often shared than others. Wild game, for example, is usually unpredictable; when hunters go out to hunt, they cannot be sure that they will come back with meat. Wild plants, on the other hand, are more predictable; gatherers can be sure when they go out that they will come back with at least some plant foods. In any case, it does appear that game tends to be

![](_page_14_Picture_4.jpeg)

Hunting success is less predictable than gathering. Like many foragers, the Aché of eastern Paraguay share the meat from hunting.

shared by food collectors much more than wild plant foods.<sup>49</sup> Even among people who depend largely on horticulture, such as the Yanomamö of Venezuela and Brazil, food items that are less predictably obtained (hunted game and fish) are shared more often than the more predictably obtained garden produce.<sup>50</sup>

Does food sharing increase the food supply for an individual? Calculations for the Aché of eastern Paraguay, who get most of their food from hunting when they go on food-collecting trips, suggest that the average individual gets more food when food is shared. Even the males who actually do the hunting get more, although the benefits are greater for the females and children on the trip.<sup>51</sup> Mathematically, the risk that an individual food collector will not find enough food on a particular day will be appreciably reduced if at least six to eight adult collectors share the food they collect. Food-collecting bands may often contain only twenty-five to thirty people, which is about the size that is needed to ensure that there are six to eight adult collectors.<sup>52</sup>

Although giving things to others may be expected in some societies, this does not necessarily mean that everyone does so willingly, or without some social pressure. For example, the !Kung call

"far-hearted" anyone who does not give gifts, and they express their disapproval openly. The necessity to reduce tensions, to avoid envy and anger, and to keep all social relations peaceful, not only within their own band but among all !Kung bands, creates continuing cross-currents of obligation and friendship. These are maintained, renewed, or established through the generalized reciprocity of gift giving. In a sense, one can say that in exchange for a gift one gains prestige or perhaps "social credit" for a potential return at some indefinite time in the future. But this gain clearly is not based on explicit return considerations. Among the !Kung as well as other foraging groups, a person who does not hunt will still get a share of meat.

Day-to-day unpredictability is one thing; more prolonged scarcity is another. What happens to a system of generalized reciprocity when resources are scarce because of a drought or other disaster? Does the ethic of giving break down? Evidence from a few societies suggests that the degree of sharing may actually increase during the period of food shortage.<sup>53</sup> For example, in describing the Netsilik Inuit, Asen Balikci said, "Whenever game was abundant, sharing among non-relatives was avoided, since every family was supposedly capable of obtaining the necessary catch. In situations of scarcity, however, caribou meat was more evenly distributed throughout camp."<sup>54</sup> Sharing may increase during *mild* scarcity because people can minimize their deprivation. But generalized reciprocity may be strained by extreme scarcity. Ethnographic evidence from a few societies suggests that during famine, when individuals are actually dying from hunger, sharing may be limited to the household.<sup>55</sup>

Balanced Reciprocity. Balanced reciprocity is explicit and short-term in its expectations of return. It involves either an immediate exchange of goods or services or an agreed upon exchange over a limited period of time.

The !Kung, for instance, trade with the Tswana Bantu: a gemsbok hide for a pile of tobacco, five strings of beads made from ostrich eggshells for a spear, three small skins for a good-sized knife.<sup>56</sup> In the 1600s, the Iroquois of the North American Northeast traded deerskin to Europeans for brass kettles, iron hinges, steel axes, woven textiles, and guns.<sup>57</sup> The !Kung and Iroquois acquired trade goods by balanced reciprocity, but such exchanges were not crucial to their economies. In contrast, some societies depend much more heavily on balanced reciprocity. For example, the Efe, who hunt and gather in the Ituri Forest of central Africa, get most of their calories from manioc, peanuts, rice, and plaintains grown by another group—the agricultural Lese. Efe men and women provide labor to the Lese and in exchange receive a portion of the harvest as well as goods such as metal pots and spears.<sup>58</sup> Pastoralists too are rarely self-sufficient, as we mentioned in the preceding chapter; they have to trade their pastoral products to agriculturalists to get the grain and other things they need.

When we say that an exchange is balanced, we do not mean to imply that the things exchanged are exactly equivalent in value or that the exchange is purely economic. In the absence of a money economy, where there is no explicit standard by which value can be judged, there is no way to assess value objectively. The point is that the parties in balanced reciprocity are freely giving each other the respective goods and services they each want; they are not coerced into doing so, so presumably they are not conceiving of the exchange as unbalanced.<sup>59</sup> And when something is valued, it may be valued for other than economic reasons. The exchange itself may also be fun, adventuresome, or aesthetically pleasing, or it may enhance social relationships.

Exchanges can have different motivations and therefore may have different meanings. Consequently, some economic anthropologists now want to distinguish between gift and commodity exchanges. Gift exchanges are personal and involve the creation or perpetuation of some kind of enduring relationship between people and groups. In our society, the exchange of dinner invitations or Christmas gifts is motivated by social considerations; we are not interested only in the actual food or objects received. As we shall see shortly, some of the exchanges involved in the famous kula ring seem mostly to be motivated by the desire to establish or cement trade partnerships. In contrast, commodity exchanges, which can occur even in the absence of money, focus on the objects or services receivedthe transaction itself is the motive. When the transaction is completed, the relationship between the parties involved usually ends.<sup>60</sup>

THE KULA RING. The horticultural Trobriand Islanders, who live off the eastern coast of New Guinea, have worked out an elaborate scheme for trading food and other items with the people of neighboring islands. Such trade is essential, for some of the islands are small and rocky and cannot produce enough food to sustain their inhabitants, who specialize instead in canoe building, pottery making, and other crafts. Other islands produce far more yams, taro, and pigs than they need. Yet the trade of such necessary items is carefully hidden beneath the panoply of the **kula ring**, a ceremonial exchange of valued shell ornaments.<sup>61</sup>

Two kinds of ornaments are involved in the ceremony of exchanges-white shell armbands (mwali), which travel around the circle of islands in a counterclockwise direction, and red shell necklaces (soulava), which travel in a clockwise direction (see Figure 7-1). The possession of one or more of these ornaments allows a man to organize an expedition to the home of one of his trading partners on another island. The high point of an expedition is the ceremonial giving of the valued kula ornaments. Each member of the expedition receives a shell ornament from his trading partner and then remains on the island for two or three days as the guest of that person. During the visit the real trading goes on. Some of the exchange takes the form of gift giving between trading partners. There is also exchange or barter between expedition members and others on the island. By the time the visitors leave, they have accomplished a year's trading without seeming to do so. (A somewhat similar occurrence was the American and Chinese ceremonial exchange of musk oxen and pandas when U.S. President Richard Nixon first visited the

People's Republic of China. These animals are valued because they are rare, yet they are practically useless. Immediately after the exchange of the animals, the real trading of goods between the two countries began.)

But the practical advantages of the kula ring are not the only gains. There may be purely social ones, for goods are traded with ease and enjoyment. A trading expedition takes on the flavor of adventure rather than business. Many of the traditions of the islands are kept alive: myth, romance, ritual, and history are linked to the circulating ornaments, especially the larger, finer pieces, which are well known and recognized as heirlooms. The kula ring also permits wide ownership of valuables. Instead of possessing one valued object permanently, a man is able to possess many valued things within his lifetime, each for a year or so. Each object, when it is received, arouses enthusiasm in a way that one lifelong possession could not do.<sup>62</sup>

Whatever the reasons for the origin of the kula ring, which may date back nearly 2,000 years, it continued to be an important institution after Papua New Guinea became an independent country. For example, active participation in the kula ring helped candidates in the 1960s and the 1970s to be elected to the national parliament.<sup>63</sup>

#### FIGURE 7-1 The Kula Ring

The dashed circles identify the (*kula*) communities, and the dashed rectangles show the areas indirectly affected by the kula.

![](_page_16_Figure_7.jpeg)

The *kula* is not the only form of exchange in Trobriand life. For example, on the two days following a burial, the kin of the deceased give yams, taro, and valuables to those who helped care for the deceased before death, to those who participated in the burial ceremonies, and to those who came to mourn the deceased. After these initial exchanges, the hamlet settles into mourning. Women from other hamlets bring food to the people in mourning, and the mourning women prepare bundles of banana leaves and weave skirts of banana fiber for later distribution. Husbands help their wives accumulate valuables to "buy" extra bundles of banana leaves. Then the women's mortuary ceremony is held. It is very competitive—each of the mourning women tries to distribute the most bundles and skirts. As many as 5,000 bundles and 30 skirts might be distributed by one mourning woman in a single day! Each of these giveaways completes a balanced reciprocity: the giver is reciprocating for gifts of goods and services received in the past. A woman's brothers gave her yams and taro during the year. She gives her brother's wives bundles or skirts, which are also given to those who helped make the special mourning skirts and to those who brought or cooked food during the mourning period.<sup>64</sup>

OTHER BALANCED SYSTEMS. Balanced reciprocity may involve labor as well as goods. Cooperative work parties exchange or balance gifts of labor. Among the Mundurucu, all men of the village work together to clear gardens; the men and women also work together to plant manioc shoots in each garden.<sup>65</sup> In other societies, a feast may be an additional reciprocation for the gift of labor. A cooperative work party, or kuu, among the Kpelle of Liberia may number from six to forty persons, all of whom are generally relatives or friends. In addition to promising return work on a particular date, each farmer rewards the work party's hard day's labor by providing a feast and sometimes rhythmic music to work by.<sup>66</sup>

Sometimes the line between generalized and balanced reciprocity is not so clear. Consider our gift giving at Christmastime. Although such gift giving may appear to be generalized reciprocity, there may be strong expectations of balance. Two friends or relatives may try to exchange presents of fairly equal value, based on calculations of what last year's gift cost. If a person receives a \$5 present when he or she gave a \$25 present, that person will be hurt and perhaps angry. On the other hand, a person who receives a \$500 present when he or she gave a \$25 present may well be dismayed.

Negative Reciprocity. Taking without thought of a fair return is to take advantage of another, to get something for nothing or for less than its worth. A mild form is deceitful bargaining; extreme forms are theft and other varieties of seizure. In other words, negative reciprocity ranges from "various degrees of cunning, guile, stealth, and violence to the finesse of a well-conducted horse-raid."67

Kinship Distance and Type of Reciprocity. Most food-collecting and horticultural societies depend on some form of reciprocity for the distribution of goods and labor. Sahlins suggested that whether the reciprocity is generalized, balanced, or negative depends largely on the kinship distance between persons. Generalized reciprocity may be the rule for family members and close kinsmen. Balanced reciprocity may be practiced among equals who are not closely related. Persons who would consider it inappropriate to trade with their own families will trade with neighboring groups. Negative reciprocity may be practiced against strangers and enemies.<sup>68</sup> In general, the importance of reciprocity declines with economic development.<sup>69</sup> In societies with intensive agriculture, and even more so in societies that are industrialized, reciprocity distributes only a small proportion of goods and services.

Reciprocity as a Leveling Device. Reciprocal gift giving may do more than equalize the distribution of goods within a community, as in the !Kung's sharing. It may also tend to equalize the distribution of goods between communities.

Many Melanesian societies in and near New Guinea have the custom of holding pig feasts in which 50, 100, or even 2,000 pigs are slaughtered. Andrew Vayda, Anthony Leeds, and David Smith suggested that these enormous feasts, though apparently wasteful, are just one of the outcomes of a complex of cultural practices that are highly advantageous. The people of these societies cannot accurately predict how much food they will produce during the year. Some years there will be bumper crops, other years very poor crops, because of fluctuations in the weather. So it might be wise to overplant just in case the yield is poor. Yet overplanting results in overproduction during average and exceptionally good years. What can be done with this extra food? Root crops such as yams and taro do not keep well over long periods, so any surplus is fed to pigs, which become, in effect, food-storing repositories. Pigs are then available for needed food during lean times. But if there are several years of surpluses, pigs can become too much of a good thing. Pigs wanting food can destroy yam and taro patches. When the pig population grows to menacing proportions, a village may invite other villages to a gigantic feast that results in a sharp reduction of the pig population and keeps the fields from being overrun. Over the years the pig feasts serve to equalize the food consumption, and especially the protein consumption, of all the villages that participate in the feasts.<sup>70</sup> Thus, the custom of pig feasts may be a way for villages to "bank" surplus food by storing up "social credit" with other villages, which will return that credit in subsequent feasts.

In some Melanesian societies, the pig feasts foster an element of competition among the men who give them. "Big men" may try to bolster their status and prestige by the size of their feasts. A reputation is enhanced not by keeping wealth but by giving it away. A similar situation existed among many Native American groups of the Northwest Coast, where a chief might attempt to enhance his status by holding a potlatch. At a potlatch, a chief and his group would give away blankets, pieces of copper, canoes, large quantities of food, and other items to their guests. The host chief and his group would later be invited to other potlatches.

The competitive element in the potlatch appears to have intensified after contact with whites. Because of the fur trade, the number of trade goods increased, and so more items could be given away. Possibly more important was the population decline among the Indians, caused by diseases (such as smallpox) introduced by European traders. Distant relatives of chiefs who had no direct heirs might compete for the right to the title, each attempting to give away more than the others.<sup>71</sup> Chiefs may also have attempted to attract men to their half-empty villages by spectacular giveaways.<sup>72</sup> Decimated groups might coalesce in order to maintain the potlatching. For example, when the Tlingit population declined to the low of the 1910s, kin groups coalesced in order to assemble enough resources for a potlatch.<sup>73</sup> Although the potlatch system seems wasteful in that goods were often destroyed in the competition, the system probably also served to equalize the distribution of goods among competing groups.

The Pomo Indians of central California had another way to bank credit for previous generosity. A village with an overabundance of fish or acorns might invite another village to a feast. In return for surplus fish or acorns, the guests would give the host village a certain number of beads. Before beginning the journey to the feast, the chief of the guest village would obtain from each family as many strings of beads as possible. After a few days of feasting at the

host village, the chief would trade the beads for the supply of surplus fish or acorns. Each member of the visiting village would be given an equal share of the food, regardless of how many beads had been contributed. But the members of a village would not be invited to a feast unless they brought beads to trade, and they could not obtain beads unless they had given food away themselves sometime in the past. Thus, giving away food and receiving beads in return served as a means of storing social credit for times of scarcity. Later, if food was scarce in the former host village, the villagers could use the beads they had acquired by giving in the past to obtain food from another village with a surplus. The trade feasts, then, had the effect of equalizing the consumption of food not only within a village but over a fairly widespread area.74

On one level of analysis, the Melanesian pig feasts, the Northwest Coast potlatches, and the Pomo trade feasts were all reciprocal exchanges between communities or villages. But these exchanges were not just intercommunity versions of reciprocal gift giving between individuals. Because these feasts were organized by people who collected goods, they also involved another mode of distribution, which anthropologists call redistribution.

#### Redistribution

Redistribution is the accumulation of goods (or labor) by a particular person, or in a particular place, for the purpose of subsequent distribution. Although redistribution is found in all societies, it becomes an important mechanism only in societies that have political hierarchies-that is, chiefs or other specialized officials and agencies. In all societies, there is some redistribution, at least within the family. Members of the family pool their labor or products or income for the common good. But in many societies, there is little or no redistribution beyond the family. It seems that redistribution on a territorial basis emerges when there is a political apparatus to coordinate centralized collection and distribution of goods or to mobilize labor for some public purpose.

In the African state of Bunyoro in western Uganda, for example, the king (called the *mukama*) retained much of the wealth for himself and his close kin. The mukama had the authority to grant the use of land and all other natural resources to his subordinate chiefs, and they in turn granted it to the common people. In return, everyone was required to give the mukama large quantities of food, crafts, and even labor services. The mukama then redistributed these goods and services, in theory at least, to all the people. The mukama was praised with names that emphasized his generosity: Agutamba ("he who relieves distress") and Mwebingwa ("he to whom the people run for help"). But it is clear that much of what the king redistributed did not find its way back to the common people, who produced the bulk of the goods. Instead, the wealth was distributed largely according to rank within the state.<sup>75</sup>

Other redistribution systems are more equal. For example, among the Buin of Melanesia, "the chief is housed, dressed, and fed exactly like his bondsman."76 Even though the chief owns most of the pigs, everyone shares equally in the consumption of the wealth. In general, where redistribution is important (in societies with higher levels of productivity), the wealthy are more likely than the poor to benefit from the redistributions.77

Why do redistribution systems develop? Elman Service suggested that they develop in agricultural societies that contain subregions suited to different kinds of crops or natural resources. Food collectors can take advantage of environmental variation by moving to different areas. With agriculture, the task is more difficult; it might be easier to move different products across different regions.<sup>78</sup> If the demand for different resources or products becomes too great, reciprocity between individuals might become awkward. So it might be more efficient to have someone-a chief, perhaps-coordinate the exchanges. We saw in the Pomo trade feasts that, although whole communities appeared to be engaged in reciprocal exchanges, the collection of surplus food and beads was handled by village chiefs.

Marvin Harris agreed that redistribution becomes more likely with agriculture, but for a somewhat different reason. He argued that competitive feasting, as in New Guinea, is adaptive because it encourages people to work harder to produce somewhat more than they need. Why would this feature be adaptive? Harris argued that with agriculture, people really have to produce more than they need so that they can protect themselves against crises such as crop failure. The groups that make feasts may be indirectly ensuring themselves against crises by storing up social credit with other villages, who will reciprocate by making feasts for them in the future. On the other hand, inducements to collect more than they need may not be advantageous to food-collecting groups, who might lose in the long run by overcollecting.<sup>79</sup>

# Market or Commercial Exchange

When we think of markets we usually think of bustling colorful places in other parts of the world where goods are bought and sold. In our own society we seldom use the word *market*, although we have supermarkets and the stock market and other places for buying and selling that we call shops, stores, and malls. In referring to market or commercial exchange, economists and economic anthropologists are referring to exchanges or transactions in which the "prices" are subject to supply and demand, whether or not the transactions occur in a marketplace.<sup>80</sup> "Market exchange" involves not only the exchange, or buying and selling, of goods but also transactions of labor, land, rentals, and credit.

On the surface, many market exchanges resemble balanced reciprocity. One person gives something and receives something in return. How then does market exchange differ from balanced reciprocity? It is easy to distinguish market exchange from balanced reciprocity when money is involved, since reciprocity is defined as not involving money. But market exchange need not always involve money.<sup>81</sup> For example, a landowner grants a **Current Issues** 

#### IMPACT OF THE WORLD-SYSTEM-DEFORESTATION OF THE AMAZON

When we speak of the economic system of a people, we must keep in mind that probably no group has ever been completely isolated from outside economic, political, social, or environmental events. In the modern world, with the expanding demand and opportunity of a growing world market economy, even the most selfsufficient of groups cannot avoid the effects of their connections to the outside world.

Consider the great rain forest drained by the Amazon River and its tributaries. World demand for wood, hamburger, and gold threatens to diminish the Amazon forest. Covering more than a billion acres, it is not only the home to many, largely selfsufficient indigenous cultures; it also supports about 50 percent of all the earth's plants and animals. Like many tropical forests, the Amazon has large numbers of desirable hardwood trees. Forests in Africa and Asia are already largely depleted, so the demand for wood from the Amazon has grown considerably. In addition, the Amazon Development Agency in Brazil has offered incentives to clear forest for cattle ranching, which can provide hamburger to North American fast-food restaurants. There is little concern that a few seasons of overgrazing can make it impossible even for grasses to grow in the soils of the former forest.

The indigenous people often find themselves in a land squeeze, with loggers, cattle ranchers, and miners trying to encroach on their territory. With less land, food-getting and traditional economic practices are in jeopardy. But it is naive to assume that the indigenous people are interested only in maintaining their traditional economies. They often accept the dilemma of economic development: they might lose some land, but selling rights to loggers and miners brings in money, which they can use to buy things they need and want. Researchers and some development experts are searching for ways to achieve development without destroying or degrading the environment. For example, indigenous groups are encouraged to gather Brazil nuts (a wild but renewable resource) for sale. Others are encouraged to harvest latex (natural rubber) and hearts of palm. Medicinal plants have economic value to multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnical companies, which have discovered that the conservation of biodiversity may be economically advantageous to themselves as well as to the local people and to scientists who want to study the diversity.

Can development be sustainable? That is, are resources (such as hardwoods) renewable so that both economic productivity and the environment can be protected? Even if some kind of sustainable development is possible, arranging it may require concerted effort by all involved, which requires participation by all in decision making.

Whether we like it or not, economic development and the desire for it are not going to go away. But we need to do more than applaud or bemoan economic development. In particular, we need research that reveals what impact particular changes will have on people, other animals and plants, and on the environment. Most of all, for the sake of human rights, we need to listen to the people whose lives will be most affected. to understand their needs as well as the developers'.

tenant farmer the right to use the land in exchange for a portion of the crop. So to call a transaction market exchange, we have to ask whether supply and demand determine the price. If a tenant farmer gave only a token gift to the landowner, we would not call it market exchange, just as a Christmas gift to a teacher is not payment for teaching. If tenants, however, were charged a large portion of their crops when the supply of land is short, or if landowners lowered their demands when few people wanted to tenant-farm, then we would call the transactions market or commercial exchange.

Although market exchange need not involve money, most commercial transactions, particularly nowadays, do involve what we call money.

Kinds of Money. Some anthropologists define money according to the functions and characteristics of the **general-purpose money** used in our own and other complex societies, for which nearly all goods, resources, and services can be exchanged. According to this definition, *money* performs the basic functions of serving as an accepted medium of exchange, a standard of value, and a store of wealth. As a medium of exchange, it allows all goods and services to be valued in the same objective way; we say that an object or service is worth so much money. Also, money is nonperishable, and therefore savable or storable, and almost always transportable and divisible, so transactions can involve the buying and selling of goods and services that differ in value. Although money can technically be anything, the first money systems used rare metals such as gold and silver. These metals are relatively soft and therefore can be melted and shaped into standard sizes and weights. The earliest standardized coins we know of were made by the Lydians in Asia Minor and the Chinese, in the seventh century A.D. It is important to realize that money has little or no intrinsic value; it is society that determines its value. In the United States today, paper bills, bank checks, and even debit cards are fully accepted as money. And money is increasingly transferred electronically.

General-purpose money is used both for commercial transactions (buying and selling) and for noncommercial transactions (payment of taxes or fines, personal gifts, contributions to religious and other charities). General-purpose money provides a way of condensing wealth: gold dust or nuggets are easier to carry around than bushels of wheat; paper bills, a checkbook, and plastic cards are handier than a herd of sheep or goats.

In many societies, money is not an allpurpose medium of exchange. Many peoples whose food production per capita is not sufficient to support a large population of nonproducers of food have special-purpose money. This consists of objects of value for which only some goods and services can be exchanged on the spot or through balanced reciprocity. In some parts of Melanesia, pigs are assigned value in terms of shell moneylengths of shells strung together in units each roughly as long as the distance covered by a man's outstretched arms. According to its size, a pig will be assigned a value in tens of such units up to  $100^{82}$ But shell money cannot be exchanged for all the goods or services a person might need. Similarly, a Northwest Coast native could exchange food (but not most other goods and services) for a "gift of wealth," such as blankets. The gift was a "receipt" that entitled the person to receive an equal amount of food (but little else) later.

Degrees of Commercialization. Most societies were not commercialized at all, or only barely so, when first described in the ethnographic record (by explorers, missionaries, and anthropologists). That is, most societies as first described did not rely on market or commercial exchange to distribute goods and services. But commercial exchange has become the dominant form of distribution in the modern world. (Most societies of the ethnographic past are now incorporated into larger nation-states; for example, the Trobriand Islanders and other societies in Melanesia are now districts in the nation of Papua New Guinea.) Selling nowadays goes far beyond the nation-state; the world is now a multinational market.<sup>83</sup>

But there is considerable variation in the degree to which societies today depend on market or commercial exchange. Many societies still allocate land without purchase and distribute food and other goods primarily by reciprocity and redistribution, participating only peripherally in market exchange. These are societies in transition: their traditional subsistence economies are gradually becoming commercialized. Among the Luo of western Kenya, for example, most rural families still have land that was allocated to them by their kin groups. The food they eat they mostly produce themselves. But nowadays many men also work for wages-some nearby, others far away in towns and cities (where they spend a year or two). These wages are used to pay government taxes, to pay for children's schooling, and to buy commercially produced items such as clothes, kerosene lamps, radios, fish from Lake Nyanza, tea, sugar, and coffee. Occasionally, families sell agricultural surpluses or craft items such as reed mats.

Economies such as that of the Luo are not fully commercialized, but they may become so in the future. In the chapter on culture change, we discuss some of the implications and effects of this transition to a more commercialized economy—a transition that is a worldwide phenomenon.

What anthropologists call peasant economies are somewhat more commercialized than transitional subsistence economies such as that of the Luo. Although peasants also produce food largely for their own consumption, they regularly sell part of their surplus (food, other goods, or labor) to others, and land is one of the commodities they buy, rent, and sell. But, although their production is somewhat commercialized, peasants still are not like the fully commercialized farmers in industrialized societies, who rely on the market to exchange all or almost all of their crops for all or almost all of the goods and services they need.

In fully commercialized societies such as our own, market or commercial exchange dominates the economy; prices and wages are regulated, or at least significantly affected, by the forces of supply and demand. A modern industrial or postindustrial economy may involve international as well as national markets, in which everything has a price, stated in the same money terms-natural resources, labor, goods, services, prestige items, religious and ceremonial items. Reciprocity is reserved for family members and friends or remains behind the scene in

business transactions. Redistribution, however, is an important mechanism. It is practiced in the form of taxation and the use of public revenue for transfer payments and other benefits to low-income families-welfare, social security, health care, and so on. But commercial exchange is the major way goods and services are distributed.

Why Do Money and Market Exchange Develop? Most economists think that money is invented in a society (or borrowed from another society) when trade increases and barter becomes increasingly inefficient. The more important trade is, the more difficult it is to find a person who can give something you want and wants something you have to give. Money is a valuable that can be exchanged for anything and so is an efficient medium of exchange when trade becomes important. In contrast, many anthropologists do not link the origins of money or market exchange to the necessities of trade. Instead they link the origins of money to various noncommercial "payments" such as the kula valuables, the Pomo beads, and the taxes that have to be paid to a political authority. All of the available explanations of money suggest that money will be found mostly in societies at higher levels of economic development; and indeed it is. And, if some simpler societies have money, dominant and more complex societies have usually introduced it.84

Most theories about the development of money and market exchange assume that producers have regular surpluses they want to exchange. But why do people produce surpluses in the first place? Perhaps they are motivated to produce extra only when they want to obtain goods from a distance and the suppliers of such goods are not well known to them, making reciprocity less likely as a way to obtain those goods. Some theorists suggest that market exchange begins with external (intersocietal) trade; kin would not likely be involved, so transactions would involve bargaining (and therefore market exchange, by definition). Finally, some argue that as societies become more complex and more densely populated, social bonds between individuals become less kinlike and friendly and therefore reciprocity becomes less likely.<sup>85</sup> Perhaps this is why traders in developing areas are often foreigners or recent immigrants.<sup>86</sup>

In any case, Frederic Pryor's cross-cultural research supports the notion that all types of market exchange-of goods, labor, land, and credit-are more likely with higher levels of economic productivity. Pryor also found that market exchange of goods appears at lower levels of economic develop-

ment than market exchange of labor and credit; market exchange of land, probably because it is associated with private property (individual ownership), appears mostly at the highest levels of productivity. Perhaps surprisingly, smaller societies tend to have more market exchange or trade with other societies. Larger societies can presumably get more of what they need from inside the society; for example, China has had relatively little foreign trade throughout much of its history.<sup>87</sup>

*Possible Leveling Devices in Commercial Economies.* As we will see in the next chapter, societies that depend substantially on market or commercial exchange tend to have marked differences in wealth among people. Nonetheless, there may be mechanisms that lessen the inequality, that act at least partially as leveling devices.

Some anthropologists have suggested that the fiesta complex in highland Indian communities of Latin America may be a mechanism that tends to equalize income.<sup>88</sup> In these peasant villages, fiestas are held each year to celebrate important village saints. The outstanding feature of this system is the extraordinary amount of money and labor a sponsoring family must contribute. Sponsors must hire ritual specialists, pay for church services, musicians, and costumes for dancers, and cover the complete cost of food and drink for all members of the community. The costs incurred can very easily amount to a year's wages.<sup>89</sup>

Some anthropologists have suggested that, although the richer Indians who sponsor fiestas are clearly distributing a good deal of wealth to the poorer members of their own and other communities, the fiestas do not really level wealth at all. First, true economic leveling would entail the redistribution of important productive resources such as land or animals; the fiesta only temporarily increases the general level of consumption. Second, the resources expended by the sponsors are usually extra resources that have been accumulated specifically for the fiesta-that is why the sponsors are always appointed in advance. Third, and perhaps most important, the fiestas do not seem to have reduced long-term wealth distinctions within the villages.<sup>90</sup>

In nations such as ours, can the income tax and the social-assistance programs it pays for (such as welfare and disaster relief) be thought of as leveling devices? Theoretically, our tax system is supposed to work that way by taxing higher incomes at higher rates. But we know that in fact it doesn't. Those in higher income brackets can often deduct an appreciable amount from their taxable incomes and therefore pay taxes at a relatively low rate. Our tax system may help some to escape extreme poverty, but, like the fiesta system, it has not eliminated marked distinctions in wealth.

# V SUMMARY

1. All societies have economic systems, whether or not these involve the use of money. All societies have customs specifying access to natural resources; customary ways of transforming or converting those resources, through labor, into necessities and other desired goods and services; and customs for distributing (and perhaps exchanging) goods and services.

2. Regulation of access to natural resources is a basic factor in all economic systems. The concept of individual ownership of land—including the right to use its resources and the right to sell or otherwise dispose of them-is common among intensive agriculturalists. In contrast, food collectors, horticulturalists, and pastoralists generally lack individual ownership of land. Among pastoral nomads, however, animals are considered family property and are not usually shared.

3. Every society makes use of a technology, which includes tools, constructions, and required skills. Even though food collectors and horticulturalists tend to think of tools as "owned" by the individuals who made them, the sharing of tools is so extensive that individual ownership does not have much meaning. Among intensive agriculturalists, toolmaking tends to be a specialized activity. Tools tend not be shared, except mainly by those who have purchased them together.

4. Incentives for labor vary cross-culturally. Many societies produce just for household consumption: if there are more consumers, producers work harder. In some subsistence economies, people may work harder to obtain the social rewards that come from giving to others. Forced labor generally occurs only in complex societies.

5. Division of labor by gender is universal. In many nonindustrial societies, large tasks are often accomplished through the cooperative efforts of a kinship group. Such cooperation is not as prevalent in industralized societies. In general, the more technically advanced a society is, the more surplus food it produces and the more some of its members engage in specialized work.

6. The organization of labor reaches its peak in complex societies: work groups tend to be formally organized, and sometimes there is an enforced obligation to participate. In food-collecting and horticultural societies, in contrast, there is little formal organization of work.

7. Goods and services are distributed in all societies by systems that can be classified under three types: reciprocity, redistribution, and market or commercial exchange. Reciprocity is giving and taking without the use of money and may assume three forms: generalized reciprocity, balanced reciprocity, and negative reciprocity. Generalized reciprocity is gift giving without any immediate or planned return. In balanced reciprocity, individuals exchange goods and services immediately or in the short term. Negative reciprocity is generally practiced with strangers or enemies: one individual attempts to steal from another or to cheat in trading.

Redistribution is the accumulation of 8 goods or labor by a particular person, or in a particular place, for the purpose of subsequent distribution. It becomes an important mechanism of distribution only in societies with political hierarchies.

9. Market or commercial exchange, where "prices" depend on supply and demand, tends to occur with increasing levels of economic productivity. Especially nowadays, market exchange usually involves an all-purpose medium of exchange (money). Most societies today are at least partly commercialized; the world is becoming a single market system.
