# Schools of Thought<br>in Cultural Anthropology

![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg)

Anthropologists have been going to live in other societies for nearly a hundred years. At first, there were only a few such hardy (some would say foolhardy) souls. But their number slowly increased over the years as more and more individuals became interested in the challenge of spending a year or so in some usually distant place, without the comforts of home, to learn how some other people lived and thought. The idea was to add to our knowledge so that we might someday come to understand how human cultural behavior could vary so much and yet be so much the same at different times and in different places.

Close to 2,000 societies have now been described to some extent in the literature of anthropology. This enormous wealth of information constitutes our data bank of cultural variation. If we are to understand how and why cultures differ and are similar, we must do more than simply inspect this mass of information. We must have ideas about what we should look for. Just as a photographer must aim and focus a camera in order to capture a scene, so an anthropologist must focus on what she or he considers important in order to describe, and possibly explain, some particular aspect of culture. Even the most thorough observer must concentrate on certain aspects of life and neglect others.

Which aspects of life an individual anthropologist concentrates on usually reflects his or her theoretical orientation, subject interest, or preferred method of research. A theoretical orientation is a general attitude about how cultural phenomena are to be explained. In this chapter we describe some of the major theoretical orientations that have existed in cultural anthropology. We also describe some recent schools of thought that identify themselves in terms of subject interests or methods of research.

The members of our profession do not always fit neatly into one of the categories we identify here. Nevertheless, such general labels as interpretive anthropologist, functionalist, cultural ecologist, and psychological anthropologist do provide us with a way to discuss the different styles of explanation exhibited by cultural anthropologists.

# THEORETICAL ORIENTATIONS

In anthropology, as in any discipline, there is a continual ebb and flow of ideas. One theoretical orientation will arise and may grow in popularity until another is proposed in opposition to it. Often, one orientation will capitalize on those aspects of a problem that a previous orientation ignored or played down. In our survey of the orientations that have developed since the emergence of cultural anthropology as a professional discipline, we will use an approximate historical sequence. As we discuss each school of thought, we will indicate what kinds of information or phenomena it emphasizes (if it does) as explanatory factors. Some of these orientations have passed into history by now; others continue to attract adherents.

## **Early Evolutionism**

In the early years of anthropology, the prevailing view was that culture generally develops (or evolves) in a uniform and progressive manner. It was thought that most societies pass through the same series of stages, to arrive ultimately at a common end. The sources of culture change were generally assumed to be embedded within the culture from the beginning, and therefore the ultimate course of

development was thought to be internally determined. Two nineteenth-century anthropologists whose writings exemplified the theory that culture generally evolves uniformly and progressively were Edward B. Tylor (1832-1917) and Lewis Henry Morgan (1818-1889).

Tylor maintained that culture evolved from the simple to the complex and that all societies passed through three basic stages of development: from savagery through barbarism to civilization.<sup>1</sup> "Progress" was therefore possible for all. To account for cultural variation, Tylor and other early evolutionists postulated that different contemporary societies were at different stages of evolution. According to this view, the "simpler" peoples of the day had not yet reached "higher" stages. Thus, simpler contemporary societies were thought to resemble ancient societies. The more advanced societies, on the other hand, testified to cultural evolution by exhibiting what Tylor called survivals-traces of earlier customs that survive in present-day cultures. The making of pottery is an example of a survival in the sense used by Tylor. Earlier peoples made their cooking pots out of clay; today we generally make them out of metal because it is more durable. But we still prefer dishes made out of clay.

Tylor believed there was a kind of psychic unity among all peoples that explained parallel evolutionary sequences in different cultural traditions. In other words, because of the basic similarities common to all peoples, different societies often find the same solutions to the same problems independently. But Tylor also noted that cultural traits may spread from one society to another by simple **diffusion**—the borrowing by one culture of a trait belonging to another as the result of contact between the two.

Another nineteenth-century proponent of uniform and progressive cultural evolution was Lewis Henry Morgan. A lawyer in upstate New York, Morgan became interested in the local Iroquois Indians and defended their reservation in a land-grant case. In gratitude, the Iroquois "adopted" Morgan.

In his best-known work, Ancient Society, Morgan postulated several sequences in the evolution of human culture. For example, he speculated that the family evolved through six stages. Human society began as a "horde living in promiscuity," with no sexual prohibitions and no real family structure. Next was a stage in which a group of brothers was married to a group of sisters and brother-sister matings were permitted. In the third stage, group marriage was practiced, but brothers and sisters were not allowed to mate. The fourth stage, which supposedly evolved during barbarism, was characterized by a loosely paired male and female who still lived with other people. Then came the husbanddominant family, in which the husband could have more than one wife simultaneously. Finally, the stage of civilization was distinguished by the monogamous family, with just one wife and one husband who were relatively equal in status.<sup>2</sup>

Morgan believed that family units became progressively smaller and more self-contained as human society developed. But his postulated sequence for the evolution of the family is not supported by the enormous amount of ethnographic data that has been collected since his time. For example, no recent society that Morgan would call savage indulges in group marriage or allows brother-sister mating. (In the chapter on marriage and the family, we discuss how recent cultures have varied in regard to marriage customs.)

Karl Marx was struck by the parallels between Morgan's evolutionism and his own theory of history. Marx and his co-worker, Friedrich Engels, devised a theory in which the institutions of monogamy, private property, and the state were assumed to be chiefly responsible for the exploitation of the working classes in modern industrialized societies. Marx and Engels extended Morgan's evolutionary scheme to include a future stage of cultural evolution in which monogamy, private property, and the state would cease to exist and the "communism" of primitive society would once more come into being.

The evolutionism of Tylor, Morgan, and others of the nineteenth century is largely rejected today. For one thing, their theories cannot satisfactorily account for cultural variation-why, for instance, some societies today are in "upper savagery" and others in "civilization." The "psychic unity of mankind" or "germs of thought" that were postulated to account for parallel evolution cannot also account for cultural differences. Another weakness in the early evolutionist theories is that they cannot explain why some societies have regressed or even become extinct. And finally, although other societies may have progressed to "civilization," some of them have not passed through all the stages. Thus, early evolutionist theory cannot explain the details of cultural evolution and variation as anthropology now knows them.

## Historical Particularism

The beginning of the twentieth century brought the end of evolutionism's reign in cultural anthropology. Its leading opponent was Franz Boas (1858–1942), whose main disagreement with the evolutionists involved their assumption that universal laws governed all human culture. Boas pointed out that these nineteenth-century individuals lacked sufficient data (as did Boas himself) to formulate many useful generalizations. Boas almost single-handedly trained the first generation of American anthropologists, including (among others) Alfred Kroeber, Robert Lowie, Edward Sapir, Melville Herskovits, Ruth Benedict, Clark Wissler, E. Adamson Hoebel, and Margaret Mead.<sup>3</sup>

Boas stressed the apparently enormous complexity of cultural variation, and perhaps because of this complexity he believed it was premature to formulate universal laws. He felt that single cultural traits had to be studied in the context of the society in which they appeared. In 1896, Boas published an article entitled "The Limitation of the Comparative Method of Anthropology,"<sup>4</sup> which dealt with his objections to the evolutionist approach. In it, he stated that anthropologists should spend less time developing theories based on insufficient data. Rather, they should devote their energies to collecting as much data as possible, as quickly as possible, before cultures disappeared (as so many already had, after contact with foreign societies). He asserted that only after this body of data was gathered could valid interpretations be made and theories proposed.

Boas expected that if a tremendous quantity of data was collected, the laws governing cultural variation would emerge from the mass of information by themselves. According to the method he advocated, the essence of science is to mistrust all expectations and to rely only on facts. But, the "facts" that are recorded, even by the most diligent observer, will necessarily reflect what that individual considers important. Collecting done without some preliminary theorizing, without ideas about what to expect, is meaningless, for the facts that are most important may be ignored while irrelevant ones may be recorded. Although it was appropriate for Boas to criticize previous "armchair theorizing," his concern with innumerable local details did not encourage a belief that it might be possible to explain the major variations in culture that anthropologists observe.

## Diffusionism

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, while the cultural evolutionism of Tylor and Morgan was still popular, diffusionism began to take hold among anthropologists in several parts of the world. The two main schools with a diffusionist viewpoint were the British and the German-Austrian.

The main spokesmen for the British school of diffusionism were G. Elliot Smith, William J. Perry, and W. H. R. Rivers. Smith and Perry stated that most aspects of higher civilization were developed in Egypt (which was relatively advanced culturally because of its early development of agriculture) and were then diffused throughout the world as other peoples came into contact with the Egyptians.<sup>5</sup> The British diffusionists thought that the independent parallel evolution of a particular cultural trait in two widely removed areas of the world was extremely rare. People, they believed, are inherently uninventive and invariably prefer to borrow the inventions of another culture rather than develop ideas for themselves. This viewpoint was never widely accepted, and it has now been abandoned completely.

Inspired by Fredrick Ratzel, Fritz Graebner and Father Wilhelm Schmidt led the early twentiethcentury German-Austrian diffusionist school. This school also held that people borrow from other cultures because they are basically uninventive themselves. Graebner and Schmidt suggested that cultural traits can diffuse as a group, as well as singly, over great distances.<sup>6</sup> In contrast to Smith and Perry of the British school, who assumed that all cultural traits originated in one place (Egypt) and filtered out to cultures throughout the world, the German-Austrian school suggested the existence and diffusion of several different cultural complexes (plural in German, Kulturkreise).7 Like the British diffusionists, however, the Kulturkreis (singular)

## PROMINENCE OF WOMEN IN ANTHROPOLOGY

Compared with other social sciences, anthropology (particularly ethnology) is unusual in having had a considerable number of prominent women in the early development of the discipline. In the 1920s the women included Ruth Benedict, Ruth Bunzel, Esther Goldfrank, Margaret Mead, Elsie Clews Parsons, and Hortense Powdermaker. Women's writing in anthropology is referred to at a higher rate than in other fields, and women are prominent in anthropology in another way-since 1983-1984 women were granted at least 50 percent of the doctoral degrees in the field and the percentage is climbing. In recent years women have been elected more often than men to the presidency of the American Anthropological Association. Were the early women (and the women they trained) important role models for later women? Was anthropology seen as a field where women can and do make a difference? We don't yet have more than intuitive answers to those questions, but perhaps we will get definitive answers from studying women who are considering different careers. What are their perceptions, and do

those perceptions influence their choices? Is there something about anthropology that especially appeals to women?

Given the male dominance of many fields, at least in their beginnings, what accounted for the prominence of these early women in the first place? Was it partly historical accident? Franz Boas, at Columbia, was responsible for training most of the first generation of American anthropologists, including some of the early women (Benedict, Mead, Bunzel, and Goldfrank); Powdermaker received training in England, primarily with Bronislaw Malinowski. Was Boas more receptive than other professors in the United States to mentoring women? We know that Ruth Benedict became quite close to Boas, referring to him in a letter as "Papa Franz."

Some of these early women anthropologists published books that were popular successes: Ruth Benedict's Patterns of Culture; Margaret Mead's Coming of Age in Samoa and Growing Up in New Guinea. Popular writing undoubtedly helped them become widely known to the public.

Gender equality is not the same as numerical equality. For example, there are still many more male full professors than female in anthropology. There are signs, however, that gender inequality is disappearing. In the last few years, women have received half the positions in academia, with no indications of a salary differential; as they are promoted (it is hoped, equitably), the gap at the top should disappear.

It may be that the presence of prominent women anthropologists was important in encouraging women to enter the field. It would be nice to know whether there is a general relationship between the number of female role models and the subsequent entry of women into a profession. Perhaps future comparative studies of various professions will tell us.

school provided little documentation for the historical relationships it assumed.

A separate American diffusionist school of thought, led by Clark Wissler and Alfred Kroeber (both students of Boas), also arose in the first few decades of the twentieth century. It was similar in method to the German-Austrian school but more modest in its claims. The American diffusionists attributed the characteristic features of a culture area to a geographical culture center, where the traits were first developed and from which they then diffused outward. This theory led Wissler to formulate his age-area principle: if a given trait diffuses outward from a single culture center, it follows that the most widely distributed traits found to exist around such a center must be the oldest traits.<sup>8</sup>

Although most anthropologists today acknowledge the spread of traits by diffusion, few try to account for most aspects of cultural development and variation in terms of diffusion. For one thing, the diffusionists dealt only in a very superficial way with the question of how cultural traits are transferred from one society to another. The failing was a serious one, because one of the things we want to explain is why a culture accepts or rejects or modifies a trait that one of its neighbors has. Also, even if it could be demonstrated how and why a trait diffused outward from a cultural center, we would still be no closer to an explanation of how or why the trait developed within that center in the first place.

#### Functionalism

In biology, different parts of an organism may be described by their functions, the parts they play in maintaining the life of the whole organism. Functionalism in social science similarly looks for the part (function) some aspect of culture or social life plays in maintaining a system. Two quite different schools of functionalism arose in conjunction with two British anthropologists-Bronislaw Malinowski (1884-1942) and Arthur Reginald Radcliffe-Brown (1881-1955).

Malinowski's version of functionalism assumes that all cultural traits serve the needs of indi*viduals* in a society. That is, the function of a culture trait is its ability to satisfy some basic or derived need of the members of the group. The basic needs include nutrition, reproduction, bodily comfort, safety, relaxation, movement, and growth. Some aspects of the culture satisfy these basic needs. In doing so, they give rise to derived needs that must also be satisfied. For example, culture traits that satisfy the basic need for food give rise to the secondary, or derived, need for cooperation in food collection or production. Societies will in turn develop forms of political organization and social control that guarantee the required cooperation. How did Malinowski explain such things as religion and magic? He suggested that since humans always live with a certain amount of uncertainty and anxiety, they need stability and continuity. Religion and magic are functional in that they serve those needs.<sup>9</sup>

Unlike Malinowski, Radcliffe-Brown felt that the various aspects of social behavior *maintain a so*ciety's social structure rather than satisfying individual needs. By social structure, he meant the total network of existing social relationships in a society.<sup>10</sup> Since Radcliffe-Brown's version of functionalism emphasized the social structure as the system to be maintained, the phrase structural-functionalism is often used to describe his approach.

An example of Radcliffe-Brown's structuralfunctionalist approach is his analysis of the ways in which different societies deal with the tensions that are likely to develop among people related through marriage. To reduce potential tension between inlaws, he suggested, societies do one of two things. They may develop strict rules forbidding the persons involved ever to interact face to face (as do the Navahos, for example, in requiring a man to avoid his mother-in-law). Or they may allow mutual disrespect and teasing between the in-laws. Radcliffe-Brown suggested that avoidance is likely to occur between in-laws of different generations, whereas disrespectful teasing is likely between in-laws of the same generation.<sup>11</sup> Both avoidance and teasing, he suggested, are ways to avoid real conflict and help maintain the social structure. (American motherin-law jokes may also help relieve tension.)

The major objection to Malinowski's functionalism is that it cannot readily account for cultural variation. Most of the needs he identifiedsuch as the need for food—are universal: all societies must deal with them if they are to survive. Thus, while the functionalist approach may tell us why all societies engage in food-getting, it cannot tell why different societies have different food-getting practices. In other words, functionalism does not explain why certain specific cultural patterns arise to fulfill a need that might be fulfilled just as easily by any of a number of alternative possibilities.

A major problem of the structuralfunctionalist approach is that it is difficult to determine whether a particular custom is in fact functional in the sense of contributing to the maintenance of the social system. In biology, the contribution an organ makes to the health or life of an animal can be assessed by removing it. But we cannot subtract a cultural trait from a society to see if the trait really does contribute to the maintenance of that group. It is conceivable that certain customs within the society may be neutral or even detrimental to its maintenance.

We cannot assume that all of a society's customs are functional merely because the society is functioning at the moment. And even if we are able to assess whether a particular custom is functional, this theoretical orientation fails to deal with the question of why a particular society chooses to meet its structural needs in a particular way. A given problem does not necessarily have only one solution. We still must explain why one of several possible solutions is chosen.

## **Psychological Approaches**

In the 1920s, some American anthropologists began to study the relationship between culture and personality. While there are varying opinions about how the culture-and-personality school got started, the writings of Sigmund Freud and other psychoanalysts were undoubtedly influential. Edward Sapir, one of Boas's earliest students, reviewed psychoanalytical books and seems to have influenced two other students of Boas-Ruth Benedict and Margaret Mead-who became early proponents of a psychological orientation.<sup>12</sup>

In Patterns of Culture, Benedict argued not only that cultures are patterned but also that different cultures could be characterized in terms of different personality types. In contrast to Benedict, Mead did not attempt to describe cultures in terms of personality types. But for Mead as well as Benedict, culture and personality were strongly linked. After studying three societies in New Guinea, Mead suggested that each of those societies had a different pattern of sex differences in personality. In other words, men and women were different psychologically in the three societies, and the differences were not the same across the three societies. If the women in one could act like the men in another, Mead concluded that culture, not biology, was mainly responsible for personality differences between the sexes. Although many of Benedict's and Mead's assertions were later challenged, the research of these two women aroused a great deal of interest in personality and culture and in anthropology in general.

In seminars at Columbia University in the 1930s and 1940s, Ralph Linton, an anthropologist, and Abram Kardiner, a psychoanalyst, developed important ideas for culture-and-personality studies. Kardiner suggested that in every culture there is a basic personality that is produced by certain shared cultural experiences. In other words, just as a child's later personality may be shaped by his or her earlier experiences, so the personality of adults in a society should be shaped by common cultural experiences. These shared experiences derive from the society's primary institutions, which have to do with the customary ways of making a living, the customary composition of the family, and the customs of child rearing. The basic personality structure, in turn, gives rise to the aspects of culture, called **secondary** institutions, that are created to satisfy and reconcile the needs and conflicts that constitute the basic personality structure. These institutions-which include ritual, religion, and folklore—are considered secondary because they presumably stem from the basic personality structure.<sup>13</sup>

Not all psychological anthropologists use Kardiner's entire scheme. But most assume that there is a set of typical personality characteristics in a society, whether they call it "basic personality," "national character," or "modal personality." And most accept Kardiner's assumption that the typical personality is produced by certain aspects of cultural experience, particularly the customs of child rearing.

During World War II and shortly thereafter, the culture-and-personality orientation was applied to complex societies. Most of these studies of national character attributed the apparent personality traits of different nations to aspects of child rearing. For example, three studies suggested that adult Japanese were compulsive because of the strict toilet training they received as children.<sup>14</sup> Similarly, the manic-depressive swings in emotion believed to be common among Russians were attributed by Geoffrey Gorer and John Rickman to the practice in Soviet nurseries of swaddling infants from birth.<sup>15</sup> (Swaddling involves wrapping cloth strips around an infant's body to keep arms and legs immobile.) This practice was thought to cause anger and frustration in the infant that were later expressed in the adult as manic-depressive behavior.

Unfortunately, because it was wartime, the investigators working on Japanese compulsiveness were unable to do any fieldwork. The anthropologists studying Russian character were also forced to use indirect research methods. Later, when researchers were able to obtain firsthand data from more representative samples of subjects, they discovered that the conclusions of the earlier studies were not always reliable. For example, it was found that the toilet-training practices of the Japanese

Margaret Mead in Bali

were not particularly strict. In other words, the early studies of national character had been crude attempts of analysis from a distance and were not always accurate about personality differences between complex societies.

As time went on, the focus of the psychological approach changed. While retaining their interest in Freudian theories and the relation between child training and adult personality, some anthropologists began to investigate the possible determinants of variation in child-training practices. For example, in a comparative study, Herbert Barry, Irvin Child, and Margaret Bacon suggested that the future food supply in herding and agricultural societies is best ensured by adherence to an established routine, because mistakes may jeopardize a year's food supply. In most hunting and fishing societies, however, mistakes will affect only the daily food supply. Therefore, adherence to routine is not so essential, and individual initiative may be encouraged. As the investigators predicted, the cross-cultural evidence indicates that agricultural societies are apt to stress obedience and responsibility in their child training, whereas hunting and fishing societies tend to emphasize independence and self-reliance.<sup>16</sup>

In addition to exploring the determinants of different patterns of child training, some studies have elaborated on Kardiner's suggestion that

personality traits and processes may account for cross-cultural associations between one cultural pattern and another. The argument in these studies is that certain culture traits produce certain psychological characteristics, which in turn give rise to other culture traits. Such a mediating influence of personality is suggested, for example, by the work of John Whiting and Irvin Child on cultural explanations of illness.<sup>17</sup> They suggest that severe punishment for aggression in childhood (a cultural characteristic) may lead to an exaggerated preoccupation with aggression in adulthood (a psychological characteristic), which may in turn predispose adults to believe that aggressive behavior causes illness (a cultural characteristic).

To generalize about the psychological approach to cultural anthropology, then, we may say that it tries to understand how psychological factors and processes may help to explain cultural practices.

## Later Evolutionism

The evolutionary approach to cultural variation did not die with the nineteenth century. In the 1930s, Leslie A. White attacked the Boasian emphasis on historical particularism and championed the evolutionist orientation.

Though quickly labeled a neo-evolutionist, White rejected the term, insisting that his approach did not depart significantly from the theories adopted in the nineteenth century. What White did add to the classical evolutionist approach was a conception of culture as an energy-capturing system. According to his "basic law" of cultural evolution, "other factors remaining constant, culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased."<sup>18</sup> In other words, a more advanced technology gives humans control over more energy (human, animal, solar, and so on), and cultures expand and change as a result.

White's orientation has been criticized for the same reasons that the ideas of Tylor and Morgan were. In describing what has happened in the evolution of human culture, he assumed that cultural evolution is determined strictly by conditions (preeminently technological ones) inside the culture. That is, he explicitly denied the possibility of environmental, historical, or psychological influences on cultural evolution. The main problem with such an orientation is that it cannot explain why some cultures evolve while others either do not evolve or become extinct. Thus, White's theory of energy capture as the mechanism of cultural evolution sidesteps the question of why only some cultures are able to increase their energy capture.

Julian H. Steward, another later evolutionist, divided evolutionary thought into three schools: unilinear, universal, and multilinear.<sup>19</sup> Steward believed that Morgan and Tylor's theories exemplified the unilinear approach to cultural evolution—the classical nineteenth-century orientation that attempted to place particular cultures on the rungs of a sort of evolutionary ladder. Universal evolutionists such as Leslie White, on the other hand, were concerned with culture in the broad sense, rather than with individual cultures. Steward classified himself as a multilinear evolutionist-one who deals with the evolution of particular cultures and only with demonstrated sequences of parallel culture change in different areas.

Steward was concerned with explaining specific cultural differences and similarities. Consequently, he was critical of White's vague generalities and his disregard of environmental influences. White, on the other hand, asserted that Steward fell into the historical-particularist trap of paying too much attention to particular cases.

Marshall Sahlins and Elman Service, who were students and colleagues of both White and Steward, combined the views of those two individuals by recognizing two kinds of evolution—specific and general.<sup>20</sup> Specific evolution refers to the particular sequence of change and adaptation of a particular society in a given environment. General evolution refers to a general progress of human society, in which higher forms (having higher energy capture) arise from and surpass lower forms. Thus, specific evolution is similar to Steward's multilinear evolution, and general evolution resembles White's universal evolution. Although this synthesis does serve to integrate the two points of view, it does not give us a way of explaining why general evolutionary progress has occurred. But, unlike the early evolutionists, some of the later evolutionists did suggest a mechanism to account for the evolution of particular cultures-namely, adaptation to particular environments.

## STRUCTURALISM

Claude Lévi-Strauss (born 1908) has been the leading proponent of an approach to cultural analysis called structuralism. Lévi-Strauss's structuralism differs from that of Radcliffe-Brown. Whereas Radcliffe-Brown concentrated on how the elements of a society function as a system, Lévi-Strauss concentrates more on the origins of the systems themselves. He sees culture, as expressed in art, ritual, and the patterns of daily life, as a surface representation of the underlying structure of the human mind. Consider, for example, how he tries to account for what anthropologists call a *moiety system*. Such a system is said to exist if a society is divided into two large intermarrying kin groups (each called a *moiety*probably derived from the French word moitié, meaning "half"). Lévi-Strauss says that moiety systems reflect the human mind's predisposition to think and behave in terms of binary oppositions (contrasts between one thing and another).<sup>21</sup> Clearly, a moiety system involves a binary opposition: You are born into one of two groups and you marry someone in the other. The problem with Lévi-Strauss's explanation of moieties is that he is postulating a constant-the human mind's supposed dualism-to account for a cultural feature that is not universal. Moiety systems are found in only a relatively small number of societies, so how could something that is universal explain something else that is not?

Lévi-Strauss's interpretations of cultural phenomena (which tend to be far more involved and difficult to follow than the example just described) have concentrated on the presumed cognitive processes of people—that is, the ways in which people supposedly perceive and classify things in the world around them. In studies such as The Savage Mind and The Raw and the Cooked, he suggested that even technologically simple groups often construct elaborate systems of classification of plants and animals, not only for practical purposes but also out of a need for such intellectual activity.<sup>22</sup>

Structuralism has influenced thinking not only in France; Britain too has been receptive. But the British structuralists, such as Edmund Leach, Rodney Needham, and Mary Douglas, do not follow Lévi-Strauss in looking for panhuman or universal principles in the human mind. Rather, they concentrate on applying structural analysis to particular societies and particular social institutions.<sup>23</sup> For example, Mary Douglas discusses an argument that took place in her home over whether soup is an "appropriate" supper. She suggests that meals (in her household and in culturally similar households) have certain structural principles. They have contrasts—hot and cold, bland and spiced, liquid and semiliquid—and various textures. They must incorporate cereals, vegetables,

and animal protein. Douglas concludes that if the food served does not follow these principles, it cannot be considered a meal!24

Some structuralist writings have been criticized for their concentration on abstruse, theoretical analysis at the expense of solid, ethnological observation and evidence. For example, it is not always clear how Lévi-Strauss derived a particular structuralist interpretation, and in the absence of any systematically collected supporting evidence, the reader must decide whether the interpretation seems plausible. Thus, Lévi-Strauss's studies have come to be regarded by many as vague and untestable, as self-contained intellectual constructs with little explanatory value. Moreover, even if there are some universal patterns that underlie cultural phenomena, universals or constants cannot explain cultural differences.

## Ethnoscience

Lévi-Strauss's structuralist approach involves intuitively grasping the rules of thought that may underlie a given culture. An ethnographic approach known as ethnoscience attempts to derive these rules from a logical analysis of ethnographic data that are kept as free as possible from contamination by the observer's own cultural biases.

The approach of ethnoscience is similar to that of Lévi-Strauss insofar as both are influenced by the methodology of descriptive linguistics, but there the similarity ends. Rather than collecting data according to a predetermined set of anthropological categories, the ethnoscientist seeks to understand a people's world from their point of view. Utilizing what she or he has discovered about them through studying their language, and particularly the words they use to describe what they do, the ethnoscientist tries to formulate the rules that generate acceptable behavior in the culture. The rules in question are believed to be comparable to the grammatical rules that generate the correct use of language.

Many ethnoscientists think that if we can discover the rules that generate correct cultural behavior, we can explain much of what people do and why they do it. Probably individuals do generally act according to the conscious and unconscious rules they have internalized. But we still need to understand why a particular society has developed the particular cultural rules it has. Just as a grammar does not explain how a language came to be what it is, so the ethnoscientific discovery of a culture's rules does not explain why those rules developed.

## Cultural Ecology

Some anthropologists are mostly concerned with the influence of environment on culture. Julian Steward was one of the first to advocate the study of cultural ecology-the analysis of the relationship between a culture and its environment. Steward felt that the explanation for some aspects of cultural variation could be found in the adaptation of societies to their particular environments. But rather than merely hypothesize that the environment did or did not determine cultural variation, Steward wished to resolve the question empirically—that is, he wanted to carry out investigations to substantiate his viewpoint.<sup>25</sup>

Steward felt, however, that cultural ecology must be separated from biological ecology (the study of the relationships between organisms and their environment). Later cultural ecologists such as Andrew Vayda and Roy Rappaport wish to incorporate principles of biological ecology into the study of cultural ecology in order to make a single science of ecology.<sup>26</sup> In their view, cultural traits, just like biological traits, can be considered adaptive or maladaptive. Cultural ecologists assume that cultural adaptation involves the mechanism of natural selection-the more frequent survival and reproduction of the better-adapted. Environment, including the physical and social environment, affects the development of culture traits in that "individuals or populations behaving in certain different ways have different degrees of success in survival and reproduction and, consequently, in the transmission of their ways of behaving from generation to generation."27

Consider how culture and environment may interact among the Tsembaga, who live in the interior of New Guinea.<sup>28</sup> The Tsembaga are horticulturists, living mainly on the root crops and greens they grow in home gardens. They also raise pigs. The pigs are seldom eaten; instead, they serve other useful functions. They keep residential areas clean by consuming garbage, and they help prepare the soil for planting by rooting in it. Small numbers of pigs are easy to keep; they run free all day, returning at night to eat whatever substandard tubers are found in the course of their owners' harvesting of their daily rations. Thus pigs, which require a minimum of maintenance, serve the Tsembaga both as janitors and as cultivating machines.

But problems arise when the pig herd grows large. Often there are not enough substandard tubers, and then the pigs must be fed human

rations. Also, although a small number of pigs will clean up yards and soften the soil in the gardens, a large herd is likely to intrude upon garden crops. Pigs can even break up communities. If one person's pig invades a neighbor's garden, the garden owner often retaliates by killing the offending pig. In turn, the dead animal's owner may kill the garden owner, the garden owner's wife, or one of his pigs. As the number of such feuds increases, people begin to put as much distance as possible between their pigs and other people's gardens.

Rappaport suggests that to cope with the problem of pig overpopulation, the Tsembaga have developed an elaborate cycle of rituals that involves the slaughter of large numbers of surplus pigs. The pigs can then be distributed in the form of pork-a valuable commodity-to friends and to ancestors (who, the Tsembaga believe, will grant them strength and courage in return). Thus, this cultural practice of ritual pig feasts can be viewed as a possible adaptation to environmental factors that produce a surplus pig population.

The cultural ecologist tries to explain cultural variation by suggesting how a particular trait is adaptive in a particular physical or social environment. In applying this orientation to a specific society, the ecologist may be subject to the same kind of criticism that has been directed at the structural-functionalist. Just as the structural-functionalist may not be able to show that a particular custom is functional, so the ecologist who is analyzing a specific society may not be able to show that a particular custom is adaptive. With regard to the Tsembaga, for example, it is hard to know whether their ritual pig feasts are more adaptive than other possible solutions to the problem of pig overpopulation. Might it be more adaptive to slaughter and eat pigs regularly so that pig herds never get too large?

Without being able to contrast the effects of alternative solutions, a cultural ecologist studying a single society may find it difficult to obtain evidence that a custom already in place is more adaptive than other possible solutions to the problem.

## Political Economy

Like cultural ecology, the school of thought known as political economy assumes that external forces explain the way a society changes and adapts. But it is not the natural environment, or social environment in general, that is central to the approach of political economy. What is central is the social and political impact of those powerful state societies

(principally Spain, Portugal, Britain, and France) that transformed the world by colonialism and imperialism and fostered the development of a worldwide economy or world-system.<sup>29</sup>

Some of the earliest figures associated with the political economy approach (in anthropology) were trained at Columbia University when Julian Steward was a professor there. For those students, Steward's cultural ecology was insufficiently attentive to recent world history. For example, Eric Wolf and Sidney Mintz argued that the communities they studied in Puerto Rico developed as they did because of colonialism and the establishment of plantations to supply sugar and coffee to Europe and North America.<sup>30</sup> And Eleanor Leacock, who studied the Montagnais-Naskapi Indians of Labrador, suggested that their system of family hunting territories was not an old characteristic, present before European contact, but developed instead out of the Indians' early involvement in the Europeanintroduced fur trade.31

Central to the later and continuing intellectual development of political economy in anthropology are the writings (published in the 1960s and 1970s) of two political sociologists, André Frank and Immanuel Wallerstein. Frank suggested that the development of a region (Europe, for example) depended on the suppression of development or underdevelopment of other regions (the New World, Africa). He argued that if we want to understand why a country remains underdeveloped, we must understand how it is exploited by developed nations.<sup>32</sup> Frank is concerned with what happened in the underdeveloped world. Wallerstein is more concerned with how capitalism developed in the privileged countries and how the expansionist requirements of the capitalist countries led to the emergence of the world-system.<sup>33</sup>

The political economy or world-system view has inspired many anthropologists to study history more explicitly and to explore the impact of external political and economic processes on local events and cultures in the underdeveloped world. In the past, when anthropologists first started doing fieldwork in the far corners of the world, they could imagine that the cultures they were studying (or reconstructing) could be investigated as if those cultures were more or less isolated from external influences and forces. In the modern world, such isolation hardly exists. The political economy approach has reminded us that the world, every part of it, is interconnected for better or worse.

## Sociobiology and Behavioral Ecology

The idea that natural selection can operate on the behavioral or social characteristics of populations (and not just on their physical traits) is shared by cultural ecology and another, more recent, theoretical orientation called **behavioral ecology** (or earlier, sociobiology). Developed mainly by biologists, particularly those who have concentrated on the social insects, the behavioral ecology or sociobiological orientation involves the application of biological evolutionary principles to the social behavior of animals, including humans. Some cultural anthropologists have employed theory in behavioral ecology to explain some aspects of cultural variation.<sup>34</sup>

How is behavioral ecology different from cultural ecology? Although both orientations assume the importance of natural selection in cultural evolution, they differ in important ways. Cultural ecology focuses mostly on what biologists would call group selection: cultural ecologists talk mostly about how a certain behavioral or social characteristic may be adaptive for a group or society in a given environment. (A newly emergent behavioral or social trait that is adaptive is likely to be passed on to future generations by cultural transmission.) In

contrast, behavioral ecology focuses mostly on what biologists call individual selection: behavioral ecologists talk mostly about how a certain characteristic may be adaptive for an individual in a given environment.<sup>35</sup> By *adaptive* is meant the ability of an individual to get her or his genes into future generations. Does this viewpoint imply that behavior is transmitted only through genes? No, say behavioral ecologists—what matters is that behavior is heritable-transmitted in some way (by genes or learning) to persons who share your genes (usually offspring).<sup>36</sup> If a certain behavior is adaptive for individuals in a particular environment, it should become more widespread in future generations as the individuals with those traits increase in number.

Whereas a cultural ecologist such as Rappaport might consider how ritual pig feasts were adaptive for the Tsembaga as a whole, behavioral ecologists would insist that to speak of adaptation it must be shown how the pig feasts benefited individuals and their closest kin. Behavioral ecologists might raise the following possibilities regarding pig feasts. Do the people who organize pig feasts have more children? If so, then pig feasts may benefit an individual reproductively. Are people who have excess pigs more likely to be killed because their pigs destroy

*Sometimes you can have too many pigs. A pig feast solves this problem and maintains or creates* close ties between groups. Here we see preparations for a pig feast on the island of Tanna in the New Hebrides.

others' gardens? If so, then finding a way to cut down on pigs benefits the survival chances and hence the reproductive chances of individuals. We do not know of a direct comparison of the predictions of cultural ecology and behavioral ecology, but these questions may convey how the behavioral ecology approach is different.

In general, behavioral ecological theory does not expect that "social good" will prevail unless "individual good" underlies it. Take the idea of conserving the earth's resources for the long-term benefit of others. If individuals and families are seeking to maximize their own benefits, behavioral ecology would not expect conservation practices unless an individual or family saw shortterm negative effects of their not conserving. Indeed, Bobbi Low finds cross-culturally that conservation ideas (reasons to leave resources untouched) are very rare, occurring in only 5 percent of the societies surveyed.<sup>37</sup>

This is not to say that behavioral ecology cannot explain some kinds of altruism—when a person does something apparently for the good of another person. Adopting or caring for a child of a relative may help perpetuate your own genes. Sharing food with others today may increase your own food intake in the future.

But behavioral ecology has difficulty explaining human behaviors that appear to be completely altruistic with no apparent gain for the altruist. How can we explain why so many people in the United States and other countries believe in the value of conservation? And why did some people in Nazi Germany, at risk to their own safety, hide people from the Nazis?

## Interpretive Approaches

Since about the 1960s, writers in the field of literary criticism have influenced the development of a variety of "interpretive" approaches in cultural anthropology, particularly with respect to ethnography.<sup>38</sup> Clifford Geertz popularized the idea that a culture is like a literary text that can be analyzed for meaning, as the ethnographer interprets it. According to Geertz, ethnographers choose to interpret the meaning of things in their field cultures that are of interest to themselves. Then they try to convey their interpretations of cultural meaning to people of their own culture. Thus, according to Geertz, the ethnographer is a kind of selective intercultural translator.<sup>39</sup>

Some anthropologists think that interpretation is the only achievable goal in cultural anthropology, because they do not believe it is possible to describe or measure cultural phenomena (and other things involving humans) in objective or unbiased ways.<sup>40</sup> Scientific anthropologists do not agree. To be sure, interpretive ethnographies might provide insights. But we do not have to believe what an interpretation suggests, no matter how eloquently it is stated. (We are rarely given objective evidence to support an interpretation.) Scientific researchers

## EVALUATING ALTERNATIVE THEORIES

In working among the Abelam of New Guinea, Richard Scaglion was puzzled why they invest so much energy in growing giant ceremonial yams, sometimes more than 10 feet long. And why do they abstain from sex for six months while they grow them? Of course, to try to understand, we need to know much more about the Abelam way of life. Scaglion had read about them, lived among them, and talked to them, but, as many ethnographers have discovered, the answers to why questions don't just leap out at you. Answers, at least tentative ones, often come from theoretical orientations that suggest how or where to look for answers. Richard Scaglion considers several possibilities. As Donald Tuzin had suggested for a nearby group, the Plains Arapesh, yams may be symbols of or stand for shared cultural understandings. (Looking for the meanings of symbols is a kind of interpretative approach to ethnographic data.) The Abelam think of yams as having souls who appreciate tranquility. Yams also have family lines; at marriage, the joining of family lines is symbolized by planting different yam lines in the same garden. During the yam-growing cycle (remember that yams appreciate tranquility), lethal warfare and conflict become channeled mostly into competitive but nonlethal yam-growing contests. So yam growing may be functional in the sense that it helps to foster harmony. Then again, ceremonial yam growing may have adaptive ecological consequences. Just as the Tsembaga pig feasts seemed to keep human population in line with resources, Scaglion thinks that ceremonial yam growing did too. Growing pig populations damage gardens and create conflicts, but during competitive yam ceremonies pigs are also given away, so the pig population declines. Wild animals that are hunted also have a

chance to replenish themselves because hunting is frowned upon during the yam-growing cycle.

As Scaglion's discussion illustrates, theoretical orientations help researchers derive explanations. They do not have to be "rival" explanations, in the sense that one has to be right and others wrong; more than one theory may help explain some phenomenon. But we can't assume that just because a theory sounds good, it is correct and helps us to understand. The important point is that we need something more to evaluate theory. As we discuss in the next chapter, we have to find ways to test a theory against evidence. Until we do that, we really don't know how many, or if indeed any, of the theories available are helpful.

have developed many techniques for minimizing bias and increasing the objectivity of measurement. Thus, interpretive anthropologists who deny the possibility of scientific understanding of human behavior and thinking may not know how much has been achieved so far by scientific studies of cultural phenomena, which we try to convey in the chapters that follow.

As Dan Sperber has suggested, the task of interpretation in cultural anthropology is clearly different from the task of explanation.<sup>41</sup> The goal of intepretation is to convey intuitive understanding

of human experience in a particular culture (intuitive in the sense of not requiring conscious reasoning or systematic methods of inquiry). Thus the interpretive ethnographer is like a novelist (or literary critic). In contrast, the goal of explanation is to provide causal and general understanding of cultural phenomena (causal in the sense of mechanisms that account for why something comes to be shared in a population, and general in the sense of applying to a number of similar cases).

Does one goal (interpretation versus explanation) preclude or invalidate the other? We don't think so. We share Sperber's view that interpretation and explanation are not opposed goals: they just are different kinds of understanding. Indeed, an intuitive interpretation described in causal and general terms might turn out, when scientifically tested, to be a powerful explanation!

# THE HYPOTHESIS-TESTING ORIENTATION

An increasing number of contemporary cultural anthropologists would explicitly deny that they prefer any particular theoretical orientation, subject interest, or method of research. Rather, they think of themselves as having a *hypothesis-testing* orientation. Any type of theory might be considered and a variety of research methods might be employed by such anthropologists. Their major goal is to test possible explanations because they believe that any explanation should be exposed to the possibility of being falsified by some set of systematically collected data. In the absence of such a test, these anthropologists would say that we are entitled or even obliged to be skeptical about the validity of any suggested explanation.

To those with a hypothesis-testing orientation, the plausibility or persuasiveness of an explanation cannot be considered a sufficient reason to accept it; the explanation must be tested and supported. And even if it is supported, there still may be grounds for skepticism. According to this orientation, then, all knowledge is uncertain and therefore subject to increasing or decreasing confirmation as new tests are made. If this is true-and it may be uncomfortable to acknowledge-it means that we will never arrive at absolute truth. On the other hand—and this is encouraging—we should be able to achieve a more and more reliable understanding if we keep testing our theories.

# **SUMMARY**

1. Which aspects of life an individual anthropologist concentrates on usually reflects his or her theoretical orientation, subject interest, or preferred method of research.

A theoretical orientation is usually a 2. general attitude about how cultural phenomena are to be explained.

3. The prevailing theoretical orientation in anthropology during the nineteenth century was based on a belief that culture generally evolves in a uniform and progressive manner; that is, most societies were believed to pass through the same series of stages, to arrive ultimately at a common end. Two proponents of this early theory of cultural evolution were Edward B. Tylor and Lewis Henry Morgan.

4. During the early twentieth century the leading opponent of evolutionism was Franz Boas, who rejected the way in which early evolutionists had assumed that universal laws governed all human culture. Boas stressed the importance of collecting as much anthropological data as possible, from which the laws governing cultural variation would supposedly emerge by themselves.

> The diffusionist approach, popular in 5.

the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, was developed by two main schools—the British and the German-Austrian. In general, diffusionists believed that most aspects of high civilization had emerged in culture centers from which they then diffused outward.

6. Functionalism looks for the part (function) some aspect of culture or social life plays in maintaining a system. There are two quite different schools of functionalism. Malinowski's version of functionalism assumes that all cultural traits serve the needs of individuals in a society. Radcliffe-Brown felt that the various aspects of social behavior maintain a society's social structure rather than satisfying individual needs.

7. The psychological orientation in anthropology, which began in the 1920s, seeks to understand how psychological factors and processes may help us explain cultural practices.

8. In the 1930s, the evolutionary approach to cultural development was revived by Leslie A. White, who proposed that "culture evolves . . . as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting . . . energy to work is increased." Anthropologists such as Julian H. Steward, Marshall Sahlins, and El-
