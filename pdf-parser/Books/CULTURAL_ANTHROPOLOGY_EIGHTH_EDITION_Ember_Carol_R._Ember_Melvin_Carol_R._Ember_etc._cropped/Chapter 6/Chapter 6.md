# Getting Food

![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg)

For most people in our society, getting food consists of a trip to the supermarket. Within an hour, we can gather enough food from the shelves to last us a week. Seasons don't daunt us. Week after week, we know food will be there. But we do not think of what would happen if the food were not delivered to the supermarket. We wouldn't be able to eat—and without eating for a while, we would die. Despite the old adage "Man [or woman] does not live by bread alone," without bread or the equivalent we could not live at all. Food-getting activities, then, take precedence over other activities important to survival. Reproduction, social control (the maintenance of peace and order within a group), defense against external threat, and the transmission of knowledge and skills to future generations—none could take place without energy derived from food. But it is not merely energy that is required for survival and long-term reproduction. Food-getting strategies need to provide the appropriate combination of nutrients throughout varying seasons and changing environmental conditions. Food-getting activities are also important because, as we will see in this and other chapters, the way a society gets its food strongly predicts other aspects of culture-from community size and permanence of settlement to type of economy and degree of inequality and type of political system, and even art styles and religious beliefs and practices.

In contrast with our own and similar societies, most societies have not had food-getting specialists. Rather, almost all able-bodied adults were engaged in getting food. During the 2 to 5 million years that humans have been on earth, 99 percent of the time they have obtained food by gathering wild plants, hunting wild animals, and fishing. Agriculture is a relatively recent phenomenon, dating back only about 10,000 years. And industrial or mechanized agriculture is hardly more than a century old! Harvesting machines have been used a little bit longer, but self-propelled machines had to wait for the internal combustion engine and the rise of the oil industry.

In this chapter we look at the ways different societies get food and we discuss some of the features associated with the different patterns. We ask why societies vary in their food-getting strategies. We shall see that the physical environment by itself has only a limited or restraining effect on how a society gets most of its food. To explain the variation more fully, we need to ask why societies in the prehistoric past switched from collecting wild food resources to cultivating plants and raising animals.

# FOOD COLLECTION

Food collection may be generally defined as all forms of subsistence technology in which foodgetting is dependent on naturally occurring resources—that is, wild plants and animals. Although this was the way humans got their food for most of human history, the few remaining food collectors in the world today (also referred to as foragers) live in what have been called the marginal areas of the earth-deserts, the Arctic, and dense tropical forests—habitats that do not allow easy exploitation by modern agricultural technologies.

Anthropologists are interested in studying the relatively few food-collecting societies still available for observation. These groups may help us understand some aspects of human life in the past, when all people were foragers. But we must be cautious in drawing inferences about the past from our observations of contemporary food collectors for three reasons. First, earlier foragers lived in almost all types of environments, including some very bountiful ones. Therefore, what we observe among recent and contemporary food collectors, who generally live in deserts, the Arctic, and tropical forests, may not be comparable to what would have been observable in more favorable environments in the past.<sup>1</sup> Second, contemporary foragers are not relics of the past: Like all contemporary societies, they have evolved and are still evolving. This means that the adaptations we observe in contemporary groups may be different from the adaptations made by foragers in the past. (For example, few if any contemporary hunters use stone arrowheads.) Third, recent and contemporary foragers have been interacting with kinds of societies that did not exist until after 10,000 years ago-agriculturalists, pastoralists, and intrusive powerful state societies.<sup>2</sup> Let us now examine two areas of the world with very different environments where recent food collectors lived-Australia and the North American Arctic.

#### Australian Aborigines

Before Europeans came to the Australian continent, all the aboriginal people who lived there depended on food collection. Although the way of life of Australian aborigines is now considerably altered, we consider the life of the Ngatatjara as described by Richard Gould in the 1960s, when they still lived by gathering wild plants and hunting wild animals in the Gibson Desert of western Australia.<sup>3</sup> We mostly use the present tense in our discussion because that is the custom in ethnographic writing; but the reader should understand that we are referring to aboriginal life in the 1960s.

The Ngatatjara desert environment averages less than 8 inches of rain per year, and the temperature in summer may rise to 118° F. The few permanent water holes are separated by hundreds of square miles of sand, scrub, and rock. Even before Europeans arrived in Australia, the area was sparsely populated-fewer than one person per 35 to 40 square miles. Now there are even fewer people, because the aboriginal population was decimated by introduced diseases and mistreatment after the Europeans arrived.

On a typical day, the camp begins to stir just before sunrise, while it is still dark. Children are sent to fetch water, and the people breakfast on water and food left over from the night before. In the cool of the early morning, the adults talk and make plans for the day. The talking goes on for a while. Where should they go for food-to places they have been to recently or to new places? Sometimes there are other considerations. For example, one woman may want to search for plants whose bark she needs to make new sandals. When the women decide which plants they want to collect and where they think those plants are most likely to be found, they take up their digging sticks and set out with large wooden bowls of drinking water on their heads. Their children ride on their hips or walk alongside. Meanwhile, the men may have decided to hunt emus, 6-foot-tall ostrichlike birds that do not fly. The men go to a creek bed where they will wait to ambush any game that may come along. They lie patiently behind a screen of brush they have set up, hoping for a chance to throw a spear at an emu or even a kangaroo. They can throw only once, because if they miss, the game will run away.

By noon the men and women are usually back at camp, the women with their wooden bowls each filled with up to 15 pounds of fruit or other plant foods, the men more often than not with only some small game such as lizards and rabbits. The men's food-getting is less certain of success than the women's, so most of the Ngatatjara aborigines' diet is plant food. The daily cooked meal is eaten toward evening, after an afternoon spent resting, gossiping, and making or repairing tools.

The aborigines traditionally were nomadic, moving their campsites fairly frequently. The campsites were isolated and inhabited by only a small number of people, or they were clusters of groups including as many as eighty persons. The aborigines never established a campsite right next to a place with water. If they were too close, their presence would frighten game away and might cause tension with neighboring bands, who also would wait for game to come to the scarce watering spots.

Nowadays, many aborigines live in small settled villages. For example, in the 1980s Victoria Burbank worked in a village she calls "Mangrove" in the Northern Territory of Australia. The once nomadic aborigines now live in a village of about 600, which was founded in the 1950s around a Protestant mission. Their houses have stoves, refrigerators, toilets, washing machines, and even television. Their children attend school full-time, and there is a health clinic for their medical needs. They still do some foraging, but most of their food comes from the store. Some earn wages, but many subsist on government welfare checks.<sup>4</sup>

#### The Inuit (Eskimo)

The diet of the Australian aborigines mainly included gathered wild plant foods. But for the Inuit (Eskimo) peoples, who live all year round in the North American Arctic, plants are too scarce to be the most important part of the diet. From Greenland and Labrador in the east to Alaska in the west, the Inuit used to depend almost entirely on sea and land mammals and fish. (The term Eskimo is used widely in the West, but it is not a word in any of the native languages in that area. Many of the native Arctic groups, particularly those now living in Canada, prefer to be called Inuit.)

We shall focus here on the traditional life of the north Alaskan Inupiaq as described by Ernest Burch for the beginning of the nineteenth century (the "ethnographic present" in the following discussion).<sup>5</sup> Northern Alaska is relatively "warm" for its latitude but not for most of us farther south; little sun and below-zero temperatures for a month or so in the winter are hardly warm. Rivers and lakes freeze in October and do not thaw until May. Even the ocean freezes for part of the winter.

What the Inupiaq collect for food depends mostly on the season, but the critical resources are sea mammals (ranging in size from whales to seals), fish, and caribou or wild reindeer. The usual technique for hunting sea mammals is to hurl a toggle harpoon into a sea mammal from a kayak. It is very difficult to kill a moving sea mammal, so hunters attach a line to the animal with the harpoon; on the other end of the line is a sealskin float that indicates where the harpooned sea mammal can be located.

![](_page_3_Picture_0.jpeg)

A modern Inuit hunter, wearing a Caribou parka and sealskin boots, aims a rifle while sitting behind the camouflage of an umbrella off Ellesmere Island.

The sea mammal gets more and more tired pulling the float until the hunter is able to kill it with a lance. One man can manage alone to hunt smaller sea mammals, but groups of men are needed to hunt whales. In the winter, when the sea ice is frozen, a different hunting technique is used. A hunter must locate a breathing hole and then wait, immobile and attentive, for hours or sometimes days until a seal comes up for air. The instant the seal surfaces, the hunter must aim perfectly with the harpoon. The women butcher the animal, prepare it for eating or storage, and process the skin. All of the skin clothing is sewn by women. They also hunt small animals, such as hares, and do much of the fishing. A variety of techniques are used for fishing-hook and line, spearing, and ambushing with nets and dams. Women make the fishing nets, and it takes the better part of a year to make one. Although there are not many plants to gather, the women do that too.

Related families usually live together and move camp by boat or sled to be in the best place to intercept the migratory animals and fish. For instance, caribou migrate, so the Inupiaq try to catch them by building a corral in a place through which they are expected to pass. A network of interrelated families lives and moves in a territory of thousands of square miles, moving outside it only when they have made arrangements with other groups to do so.

Much has changed since the time described above. Now the Inupiaq live in villages or towns with many modern conveniences. In the village of Kivalina there are permanent houses with electricity, telephones, and televisions. Dog teams have been replaced by all-terrain vehicles and snowmobiles. There are powerful outboard motors rather than skin-boats. Many men and women have full-

time wage-paying jobs. But, even though the people may buy most of their food, there is still a preference for traditional foods. So the Inupiaq still hunt and fish on the weekends.

#### General Features of Food Collectors

Despite the differences in terrain and climate under which they live and the different food-collecting technologies they use, Australian aborigines, Inuit, and most other recent foragers traditionally have certain cultural patterns in common (see Table 6-1 on page 98). Most live in small communities in sparsely populated territories and follow a nomadic lifestyle, forming no permanent settlements. As a rule, they do not recognize individual land rights. Their communities do not generally have different classes of people and tend to have no specialized or full-time political officials.<sup>6</sup> But food collectors who depend heavily on fishing are more likely to have bigger and more permanent communities and somewhat more social inequality than do those who forage for game and plants.<sup>7</sup> Division of labor in food-collecting societies is based largely on age and gender. Men exclusively hunt large marine and land animals, men usually do most of the fishing, and women usually gather wild plant foods.<sup>8</sup>

Is there a typical pattern of food-getting among food collectors? Many anthropologists have assumed for some years that foragers typically get their food more from gathering than from hunting and that women contribute more than men to subsistence (because women generally do the gathering).<sup>9</sup> Although gathering is the most important food-getting activity for some food collectors (for example, the Ngatatjara aborigines and the !Kung of southern Africa), this is not true for most recent food-collecting societies. A survey of 180 such societies indicates that there is a lot of variation with regard to which food-getting activity is most important to the society: gathering is the most important activity for 30 percent of the surveyed societies, hunting for 25 percent, and fishing for 38 percent. (Perhaps, then, we should call most recent food collectors fisher-gatherer-hunters!) In any case, because men generally do the fishing as well as the hunting, the men usually contribute more to food-getting than do the women among recent food collectors.<sup>10</sup>

Because food collectors move their camps often and walk great distances, it may seem that the food-collecting way of life is difficult. Although we do not have enough quantitative studies to tell us what is typical of most food collectors, studies **New Perspectives on Gender** 磁磁磁磁 1

#### FROM MAN THE HUNTER, TO WOMAN THE GATHERER, TO . . .?

Anthropologists know it is important to understand the foodcollecting way of life, for all humans were food collectors until 10,000 years ago. An important conference was held in 1966 to bring together anthropologists of all types to discuss what was known about food collectors. Organized by Richard B. Lee and Irven DeVore, the conference and the resulting book were called Man the Hunter. At the time, the word man was used widely in anthropology as a way of referring to humans in general. But referring to man the hunter appeared to ignore women, since women rarely do the hunting among recent foragers. It was not that women's contribution was entirely ignored by the contributors to Man the Hunter, Indeed, Richard Lee pointed out that some food collectors such as the !Kung of southwest Africa depended mostly on gathering, which was mainly women's work. Even so, the title of the conference and of the resulting book conveyed that hunting, and the work

of men, was most important among food collectors.

With the growing women's movement in the United States, thinking in anthropology subsequently began to change. New questions began to be asked. What were women doing? How much did they contribute to subsistence and to other essential economic activities? How much time did they work? What were their views of the world? What kinds of mate choices did women have? What kinds of decisions did they make? How much influence did women have?

In 1981, a book edited by Francis Dahlberg appeared. It was titled Woman the Gatherer. The editor was well aware that gathering is not usually the most important subsistence activity among food collectors. It may be more important among contemporary foragers such as the !Kung and Australian aborigines who live in warmer climates. But gathering is less important in colder climates, where most recent foragers have lived. Indeed, if we look at a large sample of recent foragers, we discover that fishing is more often the most important subsistence activity, more important (providing more calories) than either gathering or hunting! Why the title Woman the Gatherer then? Although the editor did not say so explicitly, we suggest that the title was intended to raise consciousness about the importance of women.

We now know that foodcollecting societies show considerable variability in how they get their food, so neither "Man the Hunter" nor "Woman the Gatherer" describes most foragers accurately. A book title such as Food Collectors or Foraging Humans may not as be as catchy as Man the Hunter or Woman the Gatherer, but it would be more gender-fair.

of two Australian aborigine groups<sup>11</sup> and of one !Kung group<sup>12</sup> indicate that those food collectors do not spend many hours getting food. For example, !Kung adults spend an average of about 17 hours per week collecting food. Even when you add the time spent making tools (about 6 hours a week) and doing housework (about 19 hours a week), the !Kung seem to have more leisure time than many agriculturalists, as we will discuss later.

#### FOOD PRODUCTION

Beginning about 10,000 years ago, certain peoples in widely separated geographic locations made the revolutionary changeover to **food production.** That is, they began to cultivate and then domesticate plants and animals. (Domesticated plants and animals are different from the ancestral wild forms.)

# <table> TABLE 6-1 Variation in Food-Getting and Associated Features

With domestication of these food sources, people acquired control over certain natural processes, such as animal breeding and seeding. Today, most peoples in the world depend for their food on some combination of domesticated plants and animals.

Anthropologists generally distinguish three major types of food-production systems-horticulture, intensive agriculture, and pastoralism.

#### Horticulture

The word horticulture may conjure up visions of people with "green thumbs" growing orchids and other flowers in greenhouses. But to anthropologists, the word means the growing of crops of all kinds with relatively simple tools and methods, in the absence of permanently cultivated fields. The tools are usually hand tools, such as the digging stick or hoe, not plows or other equipment pulled by animals or tractors. And the methods used do not include fertilization, irrigation, or other ways to restore soil fertility after a growing season.

There are two kinds of horticulture. The more common one involves a dependence on extensive or

shifting cultivation. The land is worked for short periods and then left idle for some years. During the years when the land is not cultivated, wild plants and brush grow up; when the fields are later cleared by slash-and-burn techniques (to be described shortly), nutrients are returned to the soil. The other kind of horticulture involves a dependence on long-growing tree crops. The two kinds of horticulture may be practiced in the same society, but in neither case is there permanent cultivation of field crops.

Most horticultural societies do not rely on crops alone for food. Many also hunt or fish; a few are nomadic for part of the year. For example, the northern Kayapo of the Brazilian Amazon leave their villages for as long as three months at a time to trek through the forest in search of game. The entire village participates in a trek, carrying large quantities of garden produce and moving their camp every day.<sup>13</sup> Other horticulturalists raise domestic animals, but these are usually not large animals such as cattle and camels.<sup>14</sup> More often than not, the animals raised by horticulturalists are smaller ones such as pigs, chickens, goats, and sheep. Let us look now at two horticultural societies, the Yanomamö

of the Brazilian-Venezuelan Amazon and the Samoans of the South Pacific.

The Yanomamö. Dense tropical forest covers most of Yanomamö territory. From the air, the typical village is located in a forest clearing and looks like a single large circular lean-to with its inner side open to the central plaza. Each individual family has its own portion of the lean-to under the common roof. Each family's portion of the lean-to has a back wall (part of the closed back wall around the circular village structure), but the portions are open on the sides to each other as well as onto the central plaza of the village. The Yanomamö get most of their calories from garden produce, but according to Raymond Hames the Yanomamö actually spend most of their time foraging.<sup>15</sup>

Before the people can plant, the forest must be cleared of trees and brush. Like most shifting cultivators, the Yanomamö use a combination of techniques: slashing the undergrowth, felling trees, and controlled burning to clear a garden spot (that is why we speak of **slash-and-burn** horticulture). Before the 1950s, the Yanomamö had only stone axes, so felling trees was quite difficult. Now they have steel machetes and axes given or traded to them by missionaries.

Because of the work involved in clearing a garden, the Yanomamö prefer to make use of forest patches that have little thorny brush and not too many large trees.<sup>16</sup> After the ground is cleared, the Yanomamö plant plantains, manioc, sweet potatoes, taro, and a variety of plants for medicine, condiments, and craft materials. Men do the heavy clearing work to prepare a garden, and they as well as women plant the crops. Women usually go to the gardens daily to weed and harvest. After two or three years the yields diminish and the forest starts growing back, making continued cultivation less desirable and more difficult, so they abandon the garden and clear a new one. If they can, they clear adjacent forest, but if gardens are far from the village they will move the village to a new location. Villages are moved about every five years because of gardening needs and warfare. There is a great deal of intervillage raiding, so villages are often forced to flee to another location.

Extensive cultivation requires a lot of territory because new gardens are not cleared until the forest grows back. What is often misunderstood is why it is so important to shift gardens. Not only is a burned field easier to plant, but all the organic matter that is burned provides necessary nutrients for a good yield. If horticulturalists come back too quickly to a

spot with little plant cover, a garden made there will not produce a satisfactory yield.

The Yanomamö crops do not provide much protein, so hunting and fishing are quite important to their diet. Men hunt animals such as birds, peccaries, monkeys, and tapir with bows and arrows. Fishing is enjoyed by women, men, and children. They catch fish by hand, with small bows and arrows and by stream poisoning. Everybody gathers honey, hearts of palm, Brazil nuts, and cashews, although the men usually climb trees to shake nuts out. Much of the foraging is done from the village base, but the Yanomamö, like the Kayapo, may go away from the village (on trek) to forage from time to time.

The Samoans. The Samoans numbered about 56,000 persons in 1839, soon after European missionaries arrived.<sup>17</sup> The islands of Samoa, which are about 2,300 miles south of the Hawaiian Islands, are volcanic in origin, with central ridges and peaks as high as 4,000 feet. Though the land is generally steep, the islands have a lush plant cover watered by up to 200 inches of rain a year (about five times the amount of rain that falls on New York City in a year). All that rain does not interfere much with outdoor activity, because the torrential showers do not last long and the water disappears quickly into the porous volcanic soil. The temperature is relatively constant, rarely falling below 70° or rising above 88° F. Strong cooling trade winds blow most of the year, generally from the east or southeast, and on the coasts one constantly hears the low rumble of huge Pacific swells breaking upon the fringing coral reefs offshore.

Samoan horticulture involves mostly three tree crops requiring little work except in harvesting. Once planted, and with hardly more than a few years of waiting, the breadfruit tree continues to produce about two crops a year for up to half a century. Coconut trees may continue to produce for a hundred years. And banana trees make new stalks of fruit, each weighing more than 50 pounds, for many years; merely cutting down one stalk induces the plant to grow another. Young men do most of the harvesting of tree crops. Women do the occasional weeding.

The Samoans also practice some shifting cultivation; men periodically clear small patches of land for taro, a root crop that is a staple food. The taro patches can produce a few crops before they must be allowed to revert to bush so that soil fertility can be restored. But even taro cultivation does not require much work; planting requires nothing more than slightly burying the top sliced off a root

![](_page_7_Picture_0.jpeg)

The islands of American Samoa have very little flat land for cultivation. Coconut trees and breadfruit trees grow in the beach area, but taro is grown on the hillside shown behind the houses. To prevent soil erosion, crops are planted interspersed amongst the naturally occurring brush. If land were completely cleared and single-cropped, the frequent torrential rains would quickly wash away the loose volcanic topsoil.

just harvested. (Young men do most of the planting and harvesting.) The taro patches are weeded infrequently, mostly by women. This kind of casual farming behavior prompted Captain Bligh, of Mutiny on the Bounty fame, to describe the Tahitians as lazy.<sup>18</sup> Captain Bligh's attitude was ethnocentric. South Pacific islanders such as the Samoans and Tahitians cannot weed as often as European farmers without risking the erosion of their soil, because, in contrast with European farmlands, which are generally flat or only slightly sloping, the land of Samoa and Tahiti is mostly steep. The Samoan and Tahitian practice of not weeding crops and growing them in glorious and messy confusion enables the deep and shallow root structures of the various plants growing together to prevent the loose volcanic soil from being washed away by the torrential showers.

The Samoans keep chickens and pigs, which they eat only occasionally. The major source of animal protein in the Samoan diet is fish caught inside and outside the reef. Younger men may swim in the deep sea outside the reef and use a sling to spear fish; older men are more likely to stand on the reef and throw a four-pointed spear at fish swimming inside the reef. For many years, people in the villages of Samoa have sold copra (the sun-dried meat of the ripe coconut) to the world market for coconut oil. Men generally cut the copra from the shells after the ripe coconuts fall by themselves to the ground. With the cash earned from the sale of copra, people buy imported things such as machetes, kerosene, and flour. People in most villages still produce most of the foods they eat, but many have migrated to towns on the bigger islands and to cities in Hawaii and on the U.S. mainland to find wage-paying jobs.

General Features of Horticulturalists. In most horticultural societies, simple farming techniques have tended to yield more food from a given area than is generally available to food collectors. Consequently, horticulture is able to support larger, more densely populated communities. The way of life of horticulturalists is more sedentary than that of food collectors, although communities may move after some years to farm a new series of plots. (Some horticulturalists have permanent villages because they depend mostly on food from trees that keep producing for a long time.) In contrast with most recent food-collecting groups, horticultural societies exhibit the beginnings of social differentiation. For example, some individuals may be part-time craftworkers or part-time political officials, and certain members of a kin group may have more status than other individuals in the society.

#### Intensive Agriculture

People engaged in intensive agriculture use techniques that enable them to cultivate fields permanently. Essential nutrients may be put back through the use of fertilizers, which may be organic material (most commonly dung from humans or other animals) or inorganic (chemical) fertilizers. But there are other ways to restore nutrients. The Luo of western Kenya plant beans around corn plants. Bacteria growing around the roots of the bean plant replace lost nitrogen, and the corn plant conveniently provides a pole for the bean plant to wind around as it grows. Some intensive agriculturalists use irrigation from streams and rivers to ensure an adequate supply of water-borne nutrients. Crop rotation and plant stubble that has been plowed under also restore nutrients to the soil.

In general, the technology of intensive agriculturalists is more complex than that of horticulturalists. Plows rather than digging sticks are generally employed. But there is enormous variation in the degree to which intensive agriculturalists rely on mechanization rather than hand labor. In some societies the most complex machine is an animal-drawn plow; in the corn and wheat belts of the United States, huge tractors till, seed, and fertilize twelve rows at a time.<sup>19</sup>

Let's look now at two groups of intensive agriculturalists; those of rural Greece and those of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam.

**Rural Greece.** The village of Vasilika is situated at the foot of Mount Parnassus on the Boeotian plain. As described by Ernestine Friedl in the 1950s, its population was about 220 inhabitants.<sup>20</sup>

Grapevines and wheat are cultivated for domestic use. The agricultural year begins in March with pruning of the vines and hoeing of the fields; these tasks are regarded as men's work. Wine making begins in September, after the grain harvest, and involves the whole family. Men, women, and children talk and joke as they pick the grapes and put them into large baskets. After the leaves and stems are removed, the fruit is trampled by the men, and the newly pressed grape juice, or *must*, is transferred to barrels. After adding whatever sugar and alcohol are needed, farmers also add resin to give the wine its characteristic flavor.

The villagers use horses to plow their wheat fields in October, and in November they sow the seed by hand. The wheat crop is harvested the following summer, usually by machine. Wheat constitutes the staple village food and is eaten as bread, as a cereal (called *trakhana*), or as noodles. It is also commonly bartered for other food items, such as fish, olive oil, and coffee.

Cotton and tobacco are the main **cash crops** (crops raised for sale). In this dry plains country, the success of the cotton crop depends on irrigation, and the villagers use efficient diesel pumps to distribute water. The real work in the cotton fields begins after the spring plowing and seeding have been completed. Then the young plants must be hoed and mulched, a task done mostly by women. The season of cotton cultivation is especially hard on women, who must do all the cooking and household chores in addition to working in the cotton fields. Irrigation, which begins in July, is men's work. It is usually done three times a season and involves the clearing of shallow ditches, the mounting of pumps, and the channeling of the water. Cotton picking, which starts in October, is considered women's work. For picking, as well as hoeing and harvesting, a farmer owning more than 5 acres usually hires women from the same village or neighboring villages, and sometimes even from distant towns. The cotton ginning is carried out by centrally located contractors, who are paid on the spot with 6 percent of each farmer's crop. Most of the seed reclaimed in the ginning is used for the next year's planting. The remainder is pressed into cakes to serve as supplementary food for ewes at lambing time. Tobacco yields a larger cash income than cotton, and the tobacco crop fits well into what would otherwise be slack periods in cultivation.

Raising animals plays a relatively minor role in the villagers' economic life. Each farmer has a horse or two for heavy draft work, a mule or donkey, about two dozen sheep, and some fowl.

Farmers at Vasilika are responsive to modern developments; they are prepared to experiment to a certain extent, especially with mechanization. Where the amount of acreage under cultivation warrants the expense, tractors are hired for plowing. Specialists are regularly called in to handle harvesting, cotton ginning, and similar tasks. Indeed, the Greek farmer is content to be a farmer and to rely on the skills of others to repair his roof, maintain his water pump, or provide the mechanical know-how for his production.

Rural Vietnam: The Mekong Delta. The village of Khanh Hau, situated along the flat Mekong Delta, comprised about 600 families when it was described in the late 1950s by Gerald Hickey before the Viet-

nam War.<sup>21</sup> The delta area has a tropical climate, with a rainy season that lasts from May to November. As a whole, the area has been made habitable only through extensive drainage.

Wet rice cultivation is the principal agricultural activity of Khanh Hau. It is part of a complex, specialized arrangement that involves three interacting components: (1) a complex system of irrigation and water control; (2) a variety of specialized equipment, including plows, water wheels, threshing sledges, and winnowing machines; and (3) a clearly defined set of socioeconomic roles-from those of landlord, tenant, and laborer to those of rice miller and rice merchant.

In the dry season, the farmer decides what sort of rice crop to plant-whether of long (120 days) or short (90 days) maturation. The choice depends on the capital at his disposal, the current cost of fertilizer, and the anticipated demand for rice. The seedbeds are prepared as soon as the rains have softened the ground in May. The soil is turned over (plowed) and broken up (harrowed) as many as six separate times, with two-day intervals for "airing" between operations. During this time, the rice seeds are soaked in water for at least two days to stimulate sprouting. Before the seedlings are planted, the paddy is plowed once more and harrowed twice in two directions at right angles.

Planting is a delicate, specialized operation that must usually be done quickly and is performed most often by hired male laborers. But efficient planting is not enough to guarantee a good crop. Proper fertilization and irrigation are equally important. In the irrigating, steps must be taken to ensure that the water level remains at exactly the proper depth over the entire paddy. Water is distributed by means of scoops, wheels, and mechanical pumps. Successive crops of rice ripen from late September to May; all members of the family may be called upon to help with the harvest. After each crop is harvested, it is threshed, winnowed, and dried. Normally, the rice is sorted into three portions: one is set aside for use by the household in the following year; one is for payment of hired labor and other services (such as loans from agricultural banks); and one is for cash sale on the market. Aside from the harvesting, women do little work in the fields; they spend most of their time on household chores. In families with little land, however, young daughters help in the fields and older daughters may hire themselves out to other farmers.

The villagers also cultivate vegetables, raise pigs, chickens, and the like, and frequently engage in fishing. The village economy usually supports three or four implement makers and a much larger number of carpenters.

General Features of Intensive-Agricultural Societies. Societies with intensive agriculture are more likely than horticulturalists to have towns and cities, a high degree of craft specialization, complex political organization, and large differences in wealth and power.

Studies suggest that intensive agriculturalists work longer hours than simpler agriculturalists.<sup>22</sup> For example, men engaged in intensive agriculture

![](_page_9_Picture_8.jpeg)

Threshing grain on a hillside in Greece on the island of Santorini in the Aegean Sea

average nine hours of work a day, seven days a week; women average almost eleven hours of work per day. Most of the work for women in intensiveagricultural societies involves food processing and work in and around the home, but they also spend a lot of time working in the fields. We discuss some of the implications of the work patterns for women in the chapter on sex, gender, and culture.

Intensive-agricultural societies are more likely than horticultural societies to face food shortages, even though intensive agriculture is generally more productive than horticulture.<sup>23</sup> Why, if more food can be produced per acre, is there more risk of shortage among intensive agriculturalists? Social scientists do not know for sure. One possibility is that intensive agriculturalists rely more often on single crops, and such crops may fail because of fluctuations in weather, plant diseases, or insect pests. Intensive agriculturalists may also be more likely to face food shortages because they are often producing crops for a market. If the market demand drops, they may not have enough cash to buy all the other food they need.

The Commercialization and Mechanization of Agriculture. Some intensive agriculturalists produce very little for sale; most of what they produce is for their own use. But there is a worldwide trend for intensive agriculturalists to produce more and more for a market. (This trend is called commercializa**tion,** which may occur in any area of life and which involves increasing dependence on buying and selling, usually with money as the medium of exchange.) The increasing commercialization of agriculture is associated with several other trends. One is that farm work is becoming more and more mechanized as hand labor becomes scarce (because of migration to industrial and service jobs in towns and cities) or too expensive. A second trend is the emergence and spread of agribusiness, large corporation-owned farms that may be operated by multinational companies and worked by hired (as opposed to "family") labor. For example, consider how cotton farming has changed in the southeastern United States. In the 1930s, mules and horses used in plowing were replaced by tractors. This change allowed some landowners to evict their sharecroppers and expand their holdings. After World War II, mechanical cotton pickers replaced most of the harvest laborers. But you had to have a good deal of money (or be a corporation) to acquire those machines, each of which cost many tens of thousands of dollars.<sup>24</sup> So the mechanization of cotton farming sent many rural farm laborers off to the cities of the north in search of employment, and the agricultural sector increasingly became big business.

A third trend associated with the commercialization of agriculture (including animal raising) is a reduction in the proportion of the population engaged in food production. In the United States, for example, less than 2 percent of the total population work on farms.<sup>25</sup>

In the next chapter, on economics, and later in the chapter on culture change, we more fully discuss some of the apparent consequences of the worldwide changeover to commercial or market economies.

"Market Foraging" in Industrial Societies. Food in countries such as the United States and Canada comes largely from intensive agriculture and animal husbandry practiced by a small proportion of the population. Those food specialists make their living by selling animal and plant products to marketers, distributors, and food processors. Indeed, most people know very little about how to grow crops or raise animals. Food appears in markets (or supermarkets) already processed by other specialists. It comes in paper or plastic packages, looking far different from how it originally looked in the field or on the feedlot. Thus, most of us are "market foragers," collecting our food from stores. In some ways, as we shall see in the chapter on psychology and culture, we behave very much like foragers of wild plants and animals. But there are also enormous differences between our kind of foraging and the original kind. If our society did not have very productive intensive agriculture and animal husbandry, we would not have towns and cities, thousands of different full-time occupations (hardly any of which are involved in food-getting), a centralized government, or many of our other characteristics.

#### Pastoralism

Most agriculturalists raise animals (practice animal husbandry), but a small number of societies depend directly or indirectly on domesticated herds of animals for their living. We call such a system pastoralism. We might assume that pastoralists breed animals to eat their meat, but most do not. Pastoralists more often get their animal protein from live animals in the form of milk, and some pastoralists regularly take blood, which is rich in protein, from their animals to mix with other foods. The herds also indirectly provide food because pastoralists trade animal products for plant foods and other necessities. In fact, a large proportion of their food may actually come from trade with agricultural

groups.<sup>26</sup> For example, some pastoral groups in the Middle East derive a good deal of their livelihood from the sale of what we call oriental rugs, which are made from the wool of their sheep on hand looms. Two pastoral societies are the Basseri of southern Iran and the Lapps of Scandinavia.

The Basseri. The Basseri, described by Fredrik Barth as of the 1960s, are a tribe of about 16,000 tent-dwelling nomads.<sup>27</sup> Their herds consist principally of sheep and goats, though donkeys and camels are raised for pulling or carrying and the wealthier men have horses for riding. Theirs is a dry, arid habitat, with rainfall averaging no more than 10 inches a year.

The Basseri's pastoral way of life is based on a regular, migratory exploitation of the grazing lands within their territory, which measures about 15,000 square miles in all. In winter, when the mountains to the north are covered with snow, the plains and foothills to the south offer extensive pasturage. During the spring, grazing is excellent on a plateau near the center of the territory. By summer, when most of the lower-lying pastures have dried up, sufficient food for the herds can be found in the mountains at an altitude of nearly 6,000 feet.

Annual migrations are so important to the economies of the Basseri and other pastoralist societies of that region that they have developed the concept of il-rah, or "tribal road." A major pastoral tribe such as the Basseri has a traditional route and schedule. The route, consisting of the localities in the order in which each is visited, follows existing passes and lines of communication. The schedule, which regulates the length of time each location will be occupied, depends on the maturation of different pastures and the movements of other tribes. The il-rah is regarded, in effect, as the property of the tribe. Local populations and authorities recognize the tribe's right to pass along roads and cultivated lands, to draw water from the public wells, and to pasture flocks on public land.

The Basseri herd sheep and goats together, with one shepherd (a boy or unmarried man) responsible for a flock of 300 to 400 animals. Children of both sexes are usually responsible for herding the baby animals (lambs and kids). Milk and its byproducts are the most important commodities, but wool, hides, and meat are also important to the economy of the Basseri. Both wool and hides are traded, but they are even more useful within the tribe. The Basseri, especially the women, are skilled spinners and weavers; much of their time is spent at

these activities. Saddlebags and pack bags are woven on horizontal looms from homespun wool and hair, as are carpets, sleeping rugs, and the characteristic black tents made of panels of woven goat hair. This hair provides an exceptionally versatile cloth. For winter use, it retains heat and repels water; in the summer, it insulates against heat and permits free circulation of air.

Lambskin hides also serve many purposes. When plucked and turned inside out, they are made into storage bags to hold water, buttermilk, sour milk, and other liquids.

Most of the Basseri must trade for the necessities and luxury items they do not produce within the community. The staple items they sell are butter, wool, lambskins, rope, and occasionally livestock.

The Lapps. The Lapps practice reindeer herding in northwestern Scandinavia where Finland, Sweden, and Norway share common frontiers. It is a typical Arctic habitat: cold, windswept, with long, dark days for half the year. Considerable change has occurred recently, so we first discuss the foodgetting strategy in the 1950s, as described by Ian Whitaker and T. I. Itkonen.<sup>28</sup>

The Lapps herd their reindeer either intensively or, more often, extensively. In the intensive system, the herd is constantly under observation within a fenced area for the whole year. Intensively herded reindeer and other animals are accustomed to human contact. Hence, the summer corralling of the females for milking and the breaking in of the ox-reindeer for use as work animals are not difficult tasks.

The extensive system involves allowing the animals to migrate over a large area. It requires little surveillance and encompasses large herds. Under this system, the reindeer are allowed to move through their seasonal feeding cycles watched by only one or two scouts. The other Lapps stay with the herd only when it has settled in its summer or winter habitat. But milking, breaking in, and corralling are harder in the extensive than in the intensive system because the animals are less accustomed to humans.

Even under the extensive system, which theoretically permits Lapps to engage in subsidiary economic activities such as hunting and fishing, the reindeer herd is the essential, if not the only, source of income. A family might possess as many as 1,000 reindeer, but usually the figure is half that number. Studies show 200 to be the minimum number of reindeer needed to provide for a family of four or five adults. Women may have shared the herding chores in the past under the intensive system, but

![](_page_12_Picture_0.jpeg)

A roundup of reindeer in Norwegian Lappland

now under the extensive system men do the herding. Women still do the milking.

The Lapps eat the meat of the bull reindeer; the female reindeer are kept for breeding purposes. Bulls are slaughtered in the fall, after the mating season. Meat and hides are frequently sold or bartered for other food and necessities.

Reindeer are still herded nowadays, but instead of sleds, one sees and hears snowmobiles, allterrain vehicles, and even helicopters used for herding. Ferries are used to move reindeer to and from different pastures, and the herders communicate by field telephones. With faster transportation, many Lapps now live in permanent homes and can still get to their herds in hours. Lapp children spend much of their time in school and, consequently, do not learn much of the herding ways. The Norwegian government now regulates pastoralism, licensing pastoralists and trying to limit the number of reindeer they can herd.<sup>29</sup>

General Features of Pastoralism. In recent times, pastoralism has been practiced mainly in grassland and other semiarid habitats that are not especially suitable for cultivation without some significant technological input such as irrigation. Most pastoralists are nomadic, moving camp fairly frequently to find water and new pasture for their herds. But other pastoralists have somewhat more sedentary lives-they may move from one settlement to another in different seasons, or they may send some people out to travel with the herds in different seasons. Pastoral communities are usually small, consisting of a group of related families.<sup>30</sup> Individuals or families may own their own animals, but decisions about when and where to move the herds are community decisions.

As we have noted, there is a great deal of interdependence between pastoral and agricultural groups. That is, trade is usually necessary for pastoral groups to survive.

# ENVIRONMENTAL RESTRAINTS ON FOOD-GETTING

Of great interest to anthropologists is why different societies have different methods of getting food. Archaeological evidence suggests that major changes in food-getting—such as the domestication of plants and animals-have been independently invented in at least several areas of the world. Yet, despite these comparable inventions and their subsequent spread by diffusion and migration, there is still wide diversity in the means by which people obtain food.

How much does the physical environment affect food-getting? Anthropologists have concluded that the physical environment by itself has a restraining, rather than a determining, effect on the major types of subsistence. Because they have very short growing seasons, cold regions of the earth are not particularly conducive to the growing of plants. No society we know of has practiced agriculture in the Arctic; instead, people who live there rely primarily on animals for food. But both food collection (as among the Inuit) and food production (as among the Lapps) can be practiced in cold areas. Indeed, cross-cultural evidence indicates that neither food collection nor food production is significantly associated with any particular type of habitat.<sup>31</sup>

We know that food collection has been practiced at one time or another in almost all areas of the earth. The physical environment does seem to have some effect on what kind of food collection is practiced, that is, on the extent to which food collectors will depend on plants, animals, or fish. Farther away from the equator, food collectors depend much less on plants for food and much more on animals and fish.<sup>32</sup> Lewis Binford argues that fishing becomes increasingly important in cold climates because food collectors need nonportable housing in severe winters to protect themselves from the cold. Therefore they cannot rely on large animals that usually have to feed themselves by moving over considerable distances in the winter. Fishing is more localized than hunting, and therefore food collectors who rely on fishing can stay in their nonportable houses in winter.<sup>33</sup>

THE EFFECT OF FOOD-GETTING ON THE ENVIRONMENT

Many people are now aware of industrial pollution—the dumping of industrial wastes in the ground or into rivers, the spewing of chemicals into the air through smokestacks. But we don't often realize how much humans have altered the environment by the ways they collect and produce food.

Consider irrigation. There are various ways to capture water for irrigation. Water can be channeled from rivers; rainwater can be caught in terraces carved out of hillsides; ancient water can be pumped up from vast underground "reservoirs" called aquifers. But not all of the water drawn for irrigation seeps into the ground. Much of it evaporates, leaving behind minerals and salts. And the more a piece of land has been irrigated, the saltier the ground becomes. Eventually, the soil becomes too salty to grow crops effectively. Some archaeologists have suggested that the accumulation of toxic salts in the soil at least partially explains the doom or decline of various groups in the past. For example, salinization may have contributed to the decline of the earliest city-states in Mesopotomia (present-day southern Iraq and southwestern Iran). The Hohokam farmers who lived in Arizona had about 150 miles of canals for irrigation; some of their ditches were 15 feet deep and 25 feet wide. In fact, their irrigation networks were comparable to those that served the

Aztecs in precolumbian Mexico City. The Hohokam seem to have vanished around A.D. 1400, perhaps because the salty soil "poisoned" their crops. Today much of the soil is still too salty for cultivation.

**Current Issues** 

The lessons of history may not have been learned yet. The San Joaquin Valley of California, perhaps the most productive agricultural area in the world, now has a serious salinization problem. One "solution" in many of the areas of the "Great American Desert" is to pump water up from underground. Indeed, in many places there is a great deal of water underground. For example, the Ogallala aquifer, which underlies parts of Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico, contains water left from the Ice Ages. But the pumping solution, if it is a solution, is only a short-term fix, for the huge Ogallala aquifer is also the fastest-disappearing aquifer. The only question is how long it will take to disappear.

Too many people raising too many animals can also have serious effects on the environment. We can easily imagine how the possibility of profit might inspire people to try to raise more animals than the land will support. For example, 300 years ago the Great American Desert looked like a vast grassland. It supported large herds of buffalo, which in the next 200 years were all but exterminated by overhunting.

The white settlers soon discovered they could raise cattle and sheep on this grassland, but in many parts of it the land was overgrazed. It took the swirling dust storms of the 1930s to make people realize that overgrazing as well as poor farming practices could be disastrous. The problems are not just recent ones. The Norse colonized Greenland and Iceland around A.D. 800. But overgrazing of pasture undoubtedly contributed to soil erosion and the disappearance or decline of the colonies by A.D. 1500.

Are environmental problems associated only with food production? Although food producers may be the worst offenders, there is reason to think that foragers may also have sometimes overfished, overgathered, or overhunted. For example, some scholars suspect that the movement of humans into the New World was mainly responsible for the disappearance of the mammoth. Unfortunately, there is little evidence that humans have been good conservers in the past. That does not mean that humans cannot do better in the future. But they have to want to.

Peregrine, eds., Research Frontiers in Anthropology (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1995). Prentice Hall/ Simon & Schuster Custom Publishing.

There is one habitat that may have precluded food collection until recent times. If it were not for the nearness of food producers (particularly agriculturalists), recent food collectors such as the Mbuti Pygmies (of central Africa) could probably not have supported themselves in the tropical forest habitats where they now live.<sup>34</sup> Tropical forests are lush in plants, but they do not provide much in the way of reachable fruits, seeds, and flowers that can be eaten by humans. Animals are available in tropical forests, but typically they are lean and do not provide humans with sufficient carbohydrates or fat. Like the Pygmy groups who hunt and gather in the forest, many tropical food collectors trade for agricultural products; other collectors cultivate some crops in addition to hunting and gathering. It would seem, then, that food collectors could not survive in tropical forests were it not for the carbohydrates they obtain from agriculturalists (whoever they are).

When we contrast horticulture and intensive agriculture, the physical environment appears to explain some of the variation. Approximately 80 percent of all societies that practice horticulture or simple agriculture are in the tropics, whereas 75 percent of all societies that practice intensive agriculture are not in tropical forest environments.<sup>35</sup>

Tropical forests have abundant rainfall. But, despite the attractiveness of lush vegetation and brilliant coloring, tropical forest lands do not usually offer favorable environments for intensive agriculture. Perhaps the heavy rainfall quickly washes away certain minerals from cleared land. Also, the difficulty of controlling insect pests and weeds (which abound in tropical forests)<sup>36</sup> may make intensive agriculture less productive.

But difficulty is not impossibility. Today, there are some areas (for instance, the Mekong Delta of Vietnam) whose tropical forests have been cleared and prevented from growing up again by the intensive cultivation of rice in paddies. And, although cultivation is not normally possible in dry lands (because of insufficient natural rainfall to sustain crops), agriculture can be practiced where there are oases—small, naturally watered areas where crops can be grown with a simple technology—or rivers that can be tapped by irrigation (one of the techniques used with intensive agriculture).

The animals raised by pastoralists depend primarily on grass for food, so it is not surprising that pastoralism is typically practiced in grassland regions of the earth. These regions may be steppes (dry, low grass cover), prairies (taller, betterwatered grass), or savannas (tropical grasslands). The grassland habitat favors large game and hence supports both hunting and pastoral technologies, except where a machine technology makes intensive agriculture possible, as in parts of the United States, Canada, and Ukraine.

Very different strategies of food-getting have been practiced in the same environment over time. For example, a dramatic illustration is the history of the Imperial Valley in California. The complex systems of irrigation now used in that dry-land area have made it a very productive region. Yet about 400 years ago, this same valley supported only hunting and gathering groups who subsisted on wild plants and animals.

It is evident from the Imperial Valley example and many others like it that the physical environment does not by itself account for the system of food-getting in an area. (Even a polar environment could have agriculture with heated greenhouses, but it would be too expensive.) Technological advances as well as enormous capital investment in irrigation, labor, and equipment have made intensive agriculture possible in the Imperial Valley. But the agriculture there is precarious, depending on sources of water and power from elsewhere. In a prolonged drought, it may be difficult or too expensive to obtain the needed water. And should the prices for vegetables fall, the farming businesses in the Imperial Valley could find themselves unable to finance the investment and borrowing they need to continue. So technological and social and political rather than environmental factors mostly determine what kind of food-getting can be practiced in a given environment.

### THE ORIGIN OF FOOD PRODUCTION

During the period from about 40,000 years ago to about 15,000 years ago, which we know best archaeologically for Europe, people seem to have gotten most of their food from hunting the available migratory herds of large animals, such as wild cattle, antelope, bison, and mammoths. These huntergatherers were probably highly mobile in order to follow the migrations of the animals. Beginning about 14,000 years ago, people in some regions began to depend less on big-game hunting and more on relatively stationary food resources such as fish, shellfish, small game, and wild plants. Salt- and freshwater food supplies may have become more abundant in many areas after the glaciers withdrew.

![](_page_15_Picture_0.jpeg)

In the Imperial Valley of Southern California, agriculture is not possible without irrigation. Here we see the irrigated fields next to desert just south of the Salton Sea.

As the ice melted, the level of the oceans rose and formed inlets and bays where crabs, clams, and sea mammals could be found. In some areas, particularly Europe and the Near East, the exploitation of local and relatively permanent resources may have accounted for an increasingly settled way of life.

We see the first evidence of a changeover to food production—the cultivation and domestication of plants and animals—in the Near East about 8000 B.C. This shift occurred, probably independently, in other areas as well. There is evidence of cultivation some time around 6000 B.C. in China, Southeast Asia (what is now Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam), and Africa. In the New World, there appear to have been several places of original cultivation and domestication. The highlands of Mexico (about 7000 B.C.) and the central Andes around Peru (by about 6000 B.C.) were probably the most important in terms of food plants used today.

Most peoples currently are food producers rather than food collectors. But why did people start to produce their food? We know that an economic transformation occurred in widely separate areas of the world beginning after about 10,000 years ago, as people began to domesticate plants and animals. But why did domestication occur? And why did it occur independently in different places within a period of a few thousand years? (Considering that people depended only on wild plants and animals for millions

of years, the differences in exactly when domestication first occurred in different parts of the world seem small.) There are many theories of why food production developed; most have tried to explain the origin of domestication in the Near East.

Lewis Binford and Kent Flannery suggested that some change, not necessarily environmental, in external circumstances must have induced or favored the changeover to food production.<sup>37</sup> As Flannery pointed out, there is no evidence of a great economic incentive for hunter-gatherers to become food producers. In fact, as we have seen, some contemporary hunter-gatherers may actually obtain adequate nutrition with far less work than many agriculturalists.

Binford and Flannery thought that the incentive to domesticate animals and plants may have been a desire to reproduce what was wildly abundant in the most bountiful or optimum hunting and gathering areas. Because of population growth in the optimum areas, people might have moved to surrounding areas containing fewer wild resources. It would have been in those marginal areas that people turned to food production in order to reproduce what they used to have.

The Binford-Flannery model seems to fit the archaeological record in the Levant (the southwestern part of the Fertile Crescent), where population increase did precede the first signs of domestication.<sup>38</sup> But as Flannery admitted, in some regions, such as southwestern Iran, the optimum huntinggathering areas do not show population increase before the emergence of domestication.<sup>39</sup>

The Binford-Flannery model focuses on population pressure in a small area as the incentive to turn to food production. Mark Cohen theorized that it was population pressure on a global scale that explains why so many of the world's peoples adopted agriculture within the span of a few thousand years.<sup>40</sup> He argued that hunter-gatherers all over the world gradually increased in population so that by about 10,000 years ago the world was more or less filled with food collectors. Thus people could no longer relieve population pressure by moving to uninhabited areas. To support their increasing populations, they would have had to exploit a broader range of less desirable wild foods; that is, they would have had to switch to broad-spectrum collecting, or they would have had to increase the yields of the most desirable wild plants by weeding, protecting them from animal pests, and perhaps deliberately planting the most productive among them. Cohen suggested that people might have tried a variety of these strategies to support themselves but would generally have ended up depending on cultivation because that would have been the most efficient way to allow more people to live in one place.

Recently, some archaeologists have returned to the idea that climatic change played a role in the emergence of agriculture. It seems clear from the evidence now available that the climate of the Near East about 13,000–12,000 years ago became more seasonal: the summers got hotter and drier than before and the winters became colder. These climatic changes may have favored the emergence of annual species of grain that archeologically we see proliferating in many areas of the Near East.<sup>41</sup> Some food collectors intensively exploited the seasonal grains, developing an elaborate technology for storing and processing the grains and giving up their previous nomadic existence to do so. The transition to agriculture may have occurred when sedentary food collection no longer provided sufficient resources for the population. This change could have happened because sedentarization led to population increase and therefore resource scarcity,<sup>42</sup> or because local wild resources became depleted after people settled down in permanent villages.<sup>43</sup>

Change to a more seasonal climate might also have led to a shortage of certain nutrients for food collectors. In the dry seasons certain nutrients would have been less available. For example, grazing animals get lean when grasses are not plentiful, and so meat from hunting would have been in short supply in the dry seasons. Although it may seem surprising, some recent hunter-gatherers have starved when they had to rely on lean meat. If they could have somehow increased their carbohydrate or fat intake, they might have been more likely to get through the periods of lean game.<sup>44</sup> So, it is possible that some wild-food collectors in the past thought of planting crops to get them through the dry seasons when hunting, fishing, and gathering did not provide enough carbohydrates and fat for them to avoid starvation.

# THE SPREAD AND INTENSIFICATION OF FOOD PRODUCTION

Whatever the reasons for the switch to food production, we still need to explain why food production has supplanted food collection as the primary mode of subsistence. We cannot assume that collectors would automatically adopt production as a superior way of life once they understood the process of domestication. After all, as we have noted, domestication may entail more work and provide less security than the food-collecting way of life.

The spread of agriculture may be linked to the need for territorial expansion. As a sedentary, foodproducing population grew, it may have been forced to expand into new territory. Some of this territory may have been vacant, but much of it was probably already occupied by food collectors. Although food production is not necessarily easier than collection, it is generally more productive per unit of land. Greater productivity enables more people to be supported in a given territory. In the competition for land between the faster-expanding food producers and the food collectors, the food producers may have had a significant advantage: they had more people in a given area. Thus, the foraging groups may have been more likely to lose out in the competition for land. Some groups may have adopted cultivation, abandoning the foraging way of life in order to survive. Other groups, continuing as food collectors, may have been forced to retreat into areas not desired by the cultivators. Today, as we have seen, the small number of remaining food collectors inhabit areas not particularly suitable for cultivation-dry lands, dense tropical forests, and polar regions.

Just as prior population growth might account for the origins of domestication, so at later periods further population growth and ensuing pressure on resources might at least partially explain the transformation of horticultural systems into intensive-agricultural systems. Ester Boserup suggested that intensification of agriculture, with a consequent increase in yield per acre, is not likely to develop naturally out of horticulture because intensification requires much more work.<sup>45</sup> She argued that people will be willing to intensify their labor only if they have to. Where emigration is not feasible, the prime mover behind intensification may be prior population growth. The need to pay taxes or tribute to a political authority may also stimulate intensification.

Intensive agriculture has not yet spread to every part of the world. Horticulture continues to be practiced in certain tropical regions, and there still are some pastoralists and food collectors. Some environments may make it difficult to adopt certain subsistence practices. For example, intensive agriculture cannot supplant horticulture in some tropical environments without tremendous investments in chemical fertilizers and pesticides, not to mention the additional labor required.<sup>46</sup> And enormous amounts of water may be required to make agriculturalists out of foragers and pastoralists who now exploit semiarid environments. Hence, the different kinds of food-getting practices we observe today throughout the world are likely to be with us for some time to come.

#### V SUMMARY

1. Food collection or foraging—hunting, gathering, and fishing-depends on wild plants and animals and is the oldest human food-getting technology. Today, however, only a small number of societies practice it, and they tend to inhabit marginal environments.

2. Food collectors can be found in various physical habitats. Most food collectors are nomadic, and population density is low. Usually, the small bands consist of related families, with the division of labor along age and gender lines only. Personal possessions are limited, individual land rights are seldom recognized, and people are not differentiated by class.

Beginning about 10,000 years ago, certain 3. peoples in widely separated geographical locations began to make the revolutionary changeover to food production—the cultivation and raising of plants and animals. Over the centuries, food production began to supplant food collection as the predominant mode of subsistence.

Horticulturalists farm with relatively sim-4. ple tools and methods and do not cultivate fields permanently. Their food supply is sufficient to support larger, more densely populated communities than can be fed by food collection. Their way of life is sedentary, although communities may move after some years to farm a new series of plots.

5. Intensive agriculture is characterized by techniques such as fertilization and irrigation that allow fields to be cultivated permanently. In contrast with horticultural societies, intensive agriculturalists are more likely to have towns and cities, a high degree of craft specialization, large differences in wealth and power, and more complex political organization. They are also more likely to face food shortages. In the modern world, intensive agriculture is increasingly mechanized and geared to production for a market.

6. Pastoralism is a subsistence technology involving principally the raising of large herds of animals. It is generally found in low-rainfall areas. Pastoralists tend to be nomadic, to have small communities consisting of related families, and to depend significantly on trade because they do not produce things (including certain types of food) they need.

7. Anthropologists generally agree that the physical environment normally exercises a restraining rather than determining influence on how people in an area get their food; technology and social and political factors may be more important.

8. Because food producers can support more people in a given territory than food collectors can, they may have had a competitive advantage in confrontations with food collectors.
