# Political Life: Social<br>Order and Disorder

![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg)

For people in the United States, the phrase political life has many connotations. It may call to mind the various branches of government: the executive branch, from the president on the national level to governors on the state level to mayors on the local level; legislative institutions, from Congress to state legislatures to city councils; and administrative bureaus, from federal-government departments to local agencies.

*Political life* may also evoke thoughts of political parties, interest groups, lobbying, campaigning, and voting. In other words, when people living in the United States think of political life, they may think first of "politics," the activities (not always apparent) that influence who is elected or appointed to political office, what public policies are established, how they get established, and who benefits from those policies.

But political life involves even more than government and politics in the United States and many other countries. Political life also involves ways of preventing or resolving troubles and disputes both within and outside the society. Internally, a complex society such as ours may employ mediation or arbitration to resolve industrial disputes, a police force to prevent crimes or track down criminals, and courts and a penal system to deal with lawbreakers as well as with social conflict in general. Externally, such a society may establish embassies in other nations and develop and utilize its armed forces both to maintain security and to support domestic and foreign interests.

By means of all these informal and formal political mechanisms, complex societies establish social order and minimize, or at least deal with, social disorder.

Formal governments have become more and more widespread around the world over the last 100 years, as powerful colonizing countries have imposed political systems upon others or as people less formally organized realized that they needed governmental mechanisms to deal with the larger world. But many societies known to anthropology did not have political officials or political parties or courts or armies. Indeed, the band or village was the largest autonomous political unit in 50 percent of the societies in the ethnographic record, as of the times they were first described. And those units were only informally organized; that is, they did not have individuals or agencies formally authorized to make and implement policy or resolve disputes. Does this mean they did not have political life? If we mean political life as we know it in our own society, then the answer has to be that they did not. But if we look beyond our formal institutions and mechanisms-if we ask what functions these institutions and mechanisms perform-we find that all societies have had political activities and beliefs that are ways of creating and maintaining social order and coping with social disorder.

Many of the kinds of groups we discussed in the three previous chapters (families, descent groups, and associations) have political functions. But when anthropologists talk about political organization or political life, they are particularly focusing on activities and beliefs pertaining to territorial groups. Territorial groups, in whose behalf political activities may be organized, range from small communities (bands, villages) to large communities (towns, cities) to multilocal groups such as districts or regions, entire nations, or even groups of nations.

As we shall see, the different types of political organization, as well as how people participate in politics and how they cope with conflict, are often strongly linked to variation in food-getting, economy, and social stratification.

### VARIATION IN TYPES OF POLITICAL ORGANIZATION

Societies in the ethnographic record vary in level of political integration (the largest territorial group on whose behalf political activities are organized) and in the degree to which political authority is centralized or concentrated in the integrated group. When we describe the political integration of particular societies in this section, we focus on their traditional political systems. In many societies known to anthropology, the small community (band or village) was traditionally the largest territorial group on whose behalf political activities were organized. The authority structure in such societies did not involve any centralization: there was no political authority whose jurisdiction included more than one community. In other societies known to anthropology, political activities were traditionally organized sometimes on behalf of a multilocal group, but there was no permanent authority at the top. And in still other societies known to anthropology, political activities were often traditionally organized on behalf of multilocal territorial groups, and there was a centralized or supreme political authority at the top. In the modern world, every society has been incorporated into some larger, centralized political system. With a handful of exceptions, there are no politically autonomous bands or tribes or chiefdoms in the world any more.

Many anthropologists classify societies, present and past, in terms of the highest level of political integration that occurs and in terms of the nature of the political authority structure. For example, Elman Service suggested that most societies can be classified into four principal types of political organization: bands, tribes, chiefdoms, and states.<sup>1</sup> We shall examine how political life is organized in each of these types of society in order to see how societies vary in the ways they try to create and maintain social order. We may use the present tense in our discussion, because that is the convention in ethnographic writing, but the reader should remember that most societies that used to be organized at the band, tribe, and chiefdom levels are now incorporated into larger political entities.

#### **Band Organization**

Some societies were composed of fairly small and usually nomadic groups of people. Each of these groups is conventionally called a **band** and is politically autonomous. That is, in band organization the local group or community is the largest group that acts as a political unit. Because most recent food collectors had band organization, some anthropologists contend that this type of political organization characterized nearly all societies before the development of agriculture, or until about 10,000 years ago. But we have to remember that almost all of the described food-collecting societies are or were located in marginal environments; and almost all were affected by more dominant societies nearby.<sup>2</sup> So it is possible that what we call "band organization" may not have been typical of food collectors in the distant or prehistoric past.

Bands are typically small, and societies with bands have a low population density. Julian Steward estimated that density in band societies ranged from a maximum of about one person per 5 square miles to a minimum of one person per 50 or so square miles.<sup>3</sup> Of course, by the time they were described by anthropologists, many band societies had been severely depopulated by introduced European diseases. So band size in the ethnographic record varies considerably. The Guayaki of the Amazon Basin had about 20 individuals in their local bands; the Semang of the Malay Peninsula had 50; the Patagonian Tehuelche of South America numbered 400 to 500, perhaps the largest of all.<sup>4</sup> Band size often varies by season, with the band breaking up or recombining according to the quantity of food resources available at a given time and place. Inuit bands, for example, are smaller in the winter, when food is hard to find, and larger in the summer, when there is sufficient food to feed a larger group.

Political decision making within the band is generally informal. The "modest informal authority"<sup>5</sup> that does exist can be seen in the way decisions affecting the group are made. Because the formal, permanent office of leader typically does not exist, decisions such as when camp has to be moved or how a hunt is to be arranged are either agreed upon by the community as a whole or made by the bestqualified member. Leadership, when it is exercised by an individual, is not the consequence of bossing or throwing one's weight about. Each band may have its informal **headman**, or its most proficient hunter, or a person most accomplished in rituals. There may be one person with all these qualities, or several persons, but such a person or persons will have gained status through the community's recognition of skill, good sense, and humility. Leadership, in other words, stems not from power but from influence, not from office but from admired personal qualities.

*In many egalitarian societies leadership shifts informally* from one person to another. In much of New Guinea there is more competition for achieving "big" status. On Vanatinai the people competing are women as well as men, and so there are "big women" as well as "big men." Here a "big woman" paints the face of her cousin's widow for a feast honoring the dead man.

In Inuit bands, each settlement may have its headman, who acquires his influence because the other members of the community recognize his good judgment and superior skills. The headman's advice concerning the movement of the band and other community matters is generally heeded, but he possesses no permanent authority and has no power to impose sanctions of any kind. Inuit leaders are male. But men often consult their wives in private, and women who hunt seem to have more influence than those who do not.<sup>6</sup> In any case, leadership exists only in a very restricted sense, as among the Iglulik Inuit, for example.

> Within each settlement . . . there is as a rule an older man who enjoys the respect of the others and who decides when a move is to be made to another hunting center, when a hunt is to be started, how the spoils are to be divided, when the dogs are to be fed. . . . He is called isumaitoq, "he who thinks." It is not always the oldest man, but as a rule an elderly man who is a clever hunter or, as head of a large family, exercises great authority. He cannot be called a chief; there is no obligation to follow his counsel; but they do so in most cases, partly because they rely on his experience, partly because it pays to be on good terms with this man.7

A summary of the general features associated with band organization can be found in Table  $13-1$ . But there are exceptions to these generalizations. For example, not all known food collectors are organized at the band level or have all the features of a band type of society. The classic exceptions are the Native American societies of the Northwest Coast, who had enormous resources of salmon and other fish, relatively large and permanent villages, and political organization beyond the level of the typical band societies in the ethnographic record.

#### Tribal Organization

When local communities mostly act autonomously but there are kinship groups (such as clans) or associations (such as age-sets) that can potentially integrate several local groups into a larger unit (tribe), we say that the society has tribal organization. Unfortunately, the term "tribe" is sometimes used to refer to an entire society. That is, the entire language group may be called a tribe. But a tribal type of political system does not usually permit the entire society to act as a unit; all the communities in a tribal society may be linked only occasionally for some political (usually military) purpose. Thus, what distinguishes tribal from band political organization is the presence in the former of some multilocal (but

not usually societywide) integration. The multilocal integration, however, is not permanent, and it is in*formal* in the sense that it is not headed by political officials. Frequently, the integration is called into play only when an external threat arises; when the threat disappears, the local groups revert to self-sufficiency.<sup>8</sup> Tribal organization may seem fragileand of course it usually is—but the fact that there are social ways to integrate local groups into larger political entities means that societies with tribal organization are militarily a good deal more formidable than societies with band organization.

Societies with tribal political organization are similar to band societies in their tendency to be egalitarian (see Table 13-1). At the local level, informal leadership is also characteristic. In those tribal societies where kinship provides the basic framework of social organization, the elders of the local kin groups tend to have considerable influence; where age-sets are important, a particular age-set is looked to for leadership. But, in contrast to band societies, societies with tribal organization generally are food producers. And because cultivation and animal husbandry are generally more productive than hunting and gathering, the population density of tribal societies is generally higher, local groups are larger, and the way of life is more sedentary than in hunter-gatherer bands.

Kinship Bonds. Frequently communities are linked to each other by virtue of belonging to the same kin group, usually a unilineal group such as a lineage or clan. Kin group elders may act to settle disputes between kin group members or even attempt to punish wrongs committed against members by people belonging to different groups. In addition, kinship bonds often tend to unite members of the same descent group during periods of warfare; in many societies, as we noted previously, the organization of warfare is often the responsibility of the kin group.<sup>9</sup>

The **segmentary lineage system** is one type of tribal integration based on kinship. A society with such a system is composed of segments or parts, each similar to the others in structure and function. Every local segment belongs to a hierarchy of lineages stretching farther and farther back genealogically. The hierarchy of lineages, then, unites the segments into larger and larger genealogical groups. The closer two groups are genealogically, the greater their general closeness. In the event of a dispute between members of different segments, people related more closely to one contestant than to another take the side of their nearest kinsman.

The Tiv of northern Nigeria offer a classic example of a segmentary lineage system, one that happens to link all the Tiv into a single genealogical structure or tribe. The Tiv are a large society, numbering more than 800,000. Figure 13-1 is a representation of the Tiv lineage structure as described by Paul Bohannan:

> The lineage whose apical ancestor is some three to six generations removed from living elders and who are associated with the smallest discrete territory  $(tar)$  I call the minimal segment; . . . it can vary in population from 200 people to well over a thousand. . . . The territory of a minimal segment adjoins the territory of its sibling minimal segment. Thus, the lineage comprising two minimal segments also has a discrete territory, and is in turn a segment of a more inclusive lineage, and of its more inclusive territory. In [Figure 13-1], the whole system can be seen: the father or founder of segment  $a$  was a brother of the founder of segment  $b$ . Each is a minimal segment today, and each has its own territory. The two segments taken together are all descended from 1, and are known by his name-the children of 1. In the same way, the territory of lineage 1, made up as it is of the combined minimal territories  $a$  and  $b$ , combines with the territory of lineage 2, made up of the combined minimal territories of  $c$  and  $d$ , to form territory A, occupied by lineage segment A, all descended from a single ancestor "A." This process is extended indefinitely, right up to the apex of the genealogy, back in time to the founder who [is said to have] begot the entire people; and outwards in space to the edges of Tivland. The entire 800,000 Tiv form a single "lineage" (nongo) and a single land called Tar Tiv.<sup>10</sup>

Tiv lineage organization is the foundation of Tiv political organization. A look at Figure  $13-1$ helps to explain how. A dispute between lineages (and territories)  $a$  and  $b$  remains minor, since no more than "brother" segments are involved. But a dispute between  $a$  and  $c$  now involves lineages 1 and 2 as well, with the requirement that  $b$  assist  $a$  and  $d$ support c. This process of mutual support, often called **complementary opposition**, means that segments will unite only in a confrontation with some other group. Groups that will fight with each other in a minor dispute might coalesce at some later time against a larger group.

Externally, the segmentary lineage system was presumably very effective in allowing the Tiv to intrude into new territory and take land from other tribal societies with smaller descent groups. Individual Tiv lineage segments could call on support from related lineages when faced with border troubles.

#### FIGURE 13-1 Tiv Lineage Segments and Their Territories

Conflicts within the society (between segments), especially in border areas, were often turned outward, "releasing internal pressure in an explosive blast against other peoples."11

Segmentary lineage systems may have military advantages even when they do not unite the entire society. A classic example is the Nuer of the Upper Nile region, who had tribal (but not societywide) organization because of their segmentary lineages. In the early 1800s the Nuer had a territory of about 8,700 square miles and the neighboring Dinka had ten times that much. But by 1890, the Nuer had cut a hundred-mile swath through Dinka territory, increasing Nuer territory to 35,000 square miles. Even though the Nuer and Dinka were culturally very similar, the segmentary lineage organization of the Nuer seems to have given them a significant military advantage in their incursions into Dinka territory.<sup>12</sup>

A segmentary lineage system may generate a formidable military force, but the combinations of manpower it produces are temporary, forming and dissolving as the occasion demands.<sup>13</sup> Tribal political organization does not make for a political system that more or less permanently integrates a number of communities.

Age-Set Systems. In the previous chapter we described age-set systems in general. Here we discuss how age-sets can function as the basis of a tribal type of political organization, as among the Karimojong of northeastern Uganda.<sup>14</sup>

The Karimojong depend on cattle herding and agriculture for their livelihood. Their political community includes elders who direct day-to-day affairs, large-herd owners whose wealth enables them to have a say in certain activities, and initiated adult males whose responsibility it is to implement policy once it has been decided. Initiation into an age-set, and public acceptance of tribal customs, means that a Karimojong will ultimately become an elder and perhaps a leader of his local community.

The Karimojong age-set system has an important bearing on day-to-day tribal life. As herders, Karimojong adults are often separated from their usual settlements. Herders will meet, mingle for a while, then go their separate ways, but each may call upon other members of his age-set wherever he goes. The age-set system is important among the Karimojong because it immediately allocates to each individual a place in the system and thereby establishes for him an appropriate pattern of response. A quarrel in camp will be settled by the representatives of the senior age-set who are present, regardless of which section of the tribe they may belong to.

Among the Karimojong, political leaders are not elected from among the elders of a particular age-set, nor are they appointed; they acquire their positions informally. Usually a man's background, and the ability he has demonstrated in public debates over a period of time, will result in his being considered by the men of his neighborhood to be their spokesman. His function is to announce what course of action seems required in a particular situation, to initiate that action, and then to coordinate it after it has begun.

Most political leaders exercise their authority within the local sphere because the pastoral nature of the Karimojong economy, with its dispersed groups and movement from one feeding ground to another, offers no alternative. From time to time an elder may acquire the status of a prophet and be awarded respect and obedience on a tribal scale. He will be called upon to lead sacrifices (to avert misfortune), to undertake rainmaking (to bring prosperity), and so on. Yet even a prophet's prestige

and authority do not warrant him a position of overlord or chief.<sup>15</sup>

#### Chiefdom Organization

Whereas a tribe has some informal mechanism that can integrate more than one community, a chief**dom** has some *formal* structure that integrates more than one community into a political unit. The formal structure could consist of a council with or without a chief, but most commonly there is a person—the **chief**—who has higher rank or authority than others. Most societies at the chiefdom level of organization contain more than one multicommunity political unit or chiefdom, each headed by a district chief or a council. There may also be more than one level of chief beyond the community, such as district chiefs and higher level chiefs. Compared with tribal societies, societies with chiefdoms are more densely populated and their communities more permanent, partly as a consequence of their generally higher economic productivity (see Table 13-1).

The position of chief, which is sometimes hereditary and generally permanent, bestows high status on its holder. Most chiefdoms have social ranking and accord the chief and his family greater access to prestige. The chief may redistribute goods, plan and direct the use of public labor, supervise religious ceremonies, and direct military activities on behalf of the chiefdom.

In South Pacific chiefdoms, the chiefs carried out most of the duties we have just described. In Fijian chiefdoms, for example, the chief was responsible for the redistribution of goods and the coordination of labor:

> [The chief] could summon the community's labor on his own behalf, or on behalf of someone else who requested it, or for general purposes. . . . Besides his right to summon labor he accumulated the greater proportion of the first fruits of the yam crop . . . and he benefited from other forms of food presentation, or by the acquisition of special shares in ordinary village distribution. . . . Thus, the paramount [chief] would collect a significant part of the surplus production of the community and redistribute it in the general welfare.<sup>16</sup>

In contrast to leaders in tribal societies, who generally have to earn their privileges by their personal qualities, hereditary chiefs are said to have those qualities in their "blood." A high-ranking chief in Polynesia, that huge triangular area of islands in the South Pacific, inherited special religious power called mana. Mana sanctified his rule and protected him.<sup>17</sup> Chiefs in Polynesia had so

Chiefs in Tahiti directed military activities. Captain Cook encountered their war canoes when he visited in 1774.

much religious power that the missionaries could convert people to Christianity only after their chiefs had been converted.<sup>18</sup>

In most chiefdoms, the chiefs did not have the power to compel people to obey them; people would act in accordance with the chief's wishes because the chief was respected and often had religious authority. But in the most complex paramount chiefdoms, such as those of Hawaii and Tahiti, the chiefs seemed to have more compelling sanctions than the "power" of respect or mana. Substantial amounts of goods and services collected by the chiefs were used to support subordinates, including specialists such as high priests, political envoys, and warriors who could be sent to quell rebellious factions.<sup>19</sup> When redistributions do not go to everybody and a chief begins to use armed force, the political system is on the way to becoming what we call a state. Why chiefs sometimes are allowed to keep items for their own purposes is still a puzzle.

#### State Organization

A state, according to one more or less standard definition, is "an autonomous political unit, encompassing many communities within its territory and having a centralized government with the power to collect taxes, draft men for work or war, and decree and enforce laws."20 States, then, have a complex, centralized political structure, which includes a wide range of permanent institutions with legislative, executive, and judicial functions, and a large bureaucracy. Central to this definition is the concept of legitimate force used to implement policies both internally and externally. In states, the government tries to maintain a monopoly on the use of physical force.<sup>21</sup> This monopoly can be seen in the development of formal and specialized instruments of social control: a police force, a militia, a standing army.

Just as a particular society may contain more than one band, tribe, or chiefdom, so may it contain more than one state. The contiguously distributed population speaking a single language may or may not be politically unified in a single state. Ancient Greece was composed of many city-states. So too was Italy until the 1870s. German speakers are also not politically unified; Austria and Germany are separate states, and Germany itself was not politically unified until the 1870s. We say that a society has **state organization** when it is composed of one or more political units that are states.

A state may include more than one society. Multisociety states often are the result of conquest or colonial control when the dominant political authority, itself a state, imposes a centralized government over a territory with many different societies and cultures (as the British did in Nigeria and Kenya). Nearly all of the new multisociety states that emerged after World War II were the results of successful independence movements against colonial powers.<sup>22</sup> Most have retained their political unity despite the fact that they contain many different societies. For example, even Nigeria remains unified despite a civil war; the eastern section called Biafra (mostly populated by people of Ibo culture) tried unsuccessfully 30 years ago to secede, and subsequently there has been serious conflict between some of the constituent societies. Multisociety or multi-ethnic states may also form voluntarily, in reaction to external threat. Switzerland comprises

cantons, each of which speaks mainly French, German, Italian, or Romansch; the various cantons confederated originally to shake off control by the Holy Roman Empire.

In addition to their strictly political features, states have class stratification and hence unequal access to economic resources. State-organized societies are generally supported by intensive agriculture. The high productivity of the agriculture presumably allows for the emergence of cities, a high degree of economic and other kinds of specialization, market or commercial exchange, and class stratification (see Table 13-1).

When states come into existence, people's access to scarce resources is radically altered. So too is their ability to not listen to leaders: you cannot refuse to pay taxes and go unpunished! Of course, the rulers of a state do not maintain the social order by force alone. The people must believe, at least to some extent, that those in power have a legitimate right to govern. If the people think otherwise, history suggests that those in power may eventually lose their ability to control. Witness the recent downfall of Communist parties throughout most of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.

So force and the threat of force are not enough to explain the legitimacy of power, and the inequities that occur commonly, in state societies. But then what does? There are various theories. The rulers of early states often claimed divine descent to buttress their legitimacy, but this claim is rare nowadays. Parents may teach their children to accept all authority; such lessons may generalize to the acceptance of political authority. Some analysts think that people accept state authority for no good reason; the rulers are just able to fool them. Finally, some theorists think that states must provide people with real or rational advantages; otherwise people would not think that the rulers deserve to exercise authority. Legitimacy is not an all-or-none phenomenon; it varies in degree. Why it has varied, in different times and places, remains a classic question in the social sciences, including anthropology, as well as in philosophy and other humanistic disciplines.<sup>23</sup>

A state society can retain its legitimacy, or at least its power, for a long time. For example, the Roman Empire was a complex state society that dominated the Mediterranean and Near East for hundreds of years. It began as a city-state that waged war to acquire additional territory. At its height, the Roman Empire embraced more than 55 million

All governments, even state societies, ultimately depend on the people's sense of legitimacy. This toppled statue of Lenin symbolizes the recent breakup of the Soviet Union and the overthrow of rule by the Communist party.

people;<sup>24</sup> the capital city of Rome had a population of well over a million.<sup>25</sup> The empire included parts of what are now Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Rumania, Turkey, Greece, Armenia, Egypt, Israel, and Syria.

Another example of a state society was the kingdom of Nupe in West Africa, now part of the nation-state of Nigeria. As is characteristic of state societies, Nupe society was quite rigidly stratified. At the top of the social system was the king, or *etsu*. Beneath the king, members of the royal family formed the highest aristocratic class. Next in order were two other classes of nobility-the local chiefs and the military leaders. At the bottom were the commoners, who had neither prestige nor power, and no share in political authority.

The Nupe king possessed ultimate authority in many judicial matters. Minor disputes and civil cases were handled by local village councils, but serious criminal cases were the prerogative of the king. Such cases, referred to as "crimes for the king," were brought before the royal court by the king's local representatives. The king and his counselors judged the cases and determined suitable punishments.

The most powerful influence of the state over the Nupe people was in the area of taxation. The king was given the power to impose taxes and collect them from every household. Payment was made either in money (cowrie shells originally, and later British currency) or certain gifts, such as cloth, mats, and slaves. Much of the revenue collected was kept by the king, and the remainder was shared with his local representatives and lords. In return for the taxes they paid, the people received security-protection against invasion and domestic disorder.<sup>26</sup>

#### Factors Associated with Variation in Political Organization

The kinds of political organization we call band, tribal, chiefdom, and state are points on a continuum of levels of political integration or unification, from small-scale local autonomy to large-scale regional unification. There also is variation in political authority, from a few temporary and informal political leaders to large numbers of permanent, specialized political officials, from the absence of coercive political power to the monopoly of public force by a central authority. These aspects of variation in political organization are generally associated with shifts from food collection to more intensive food production, from small to large communities, from low to high population densities, from an emphasis on reciprocity to redistribution

to market exchange, and from egalitarian to rank to fully stratified class societies.

The associations just outlined, which seem to be confirmed by the available cross-cultural evidence, are summarized in Table 13-1. With regard to the relation between level of subsistence technology and political complexity, one cross-cultural study employing a small random sample of societies found that the greater the importance of agriculture in a society, the larger the population that is politically unified and the greater the number and types of political officials.<sup>27</sup> A massive cross-cultural survey reported a similar trend: the more intensive the agriculture, the greater the likelihood of state organization; conversely, societies with no more than local political institutions are likely to depend on hunting, gathering, and fishing.<sup>28</sup> With regard to community size, the first of these studies also suggested that the larger the leading community, the wider the range of political officials in the society.<sup>29</sup>

Robert Textor presented a similar finding: societies with state organization tend to have cities and towns, whereas those with only local political organization are more likely to have communities with an average population of fewer than 200 persons.<sup>30</sup> Cross-cultural research also tends to confirm that societies with higher levels of political integration are more likely to exhibit social differentiation, especially in the form of class distinctions.<sup>31</sup>

Does this evidence provide us with an explanation for why political organization varies? Clearly, the data indicate that several factors are associated with political development, but exactly why changes in organization occur is not yet understood. Although economic development may be a necessary condition for political development,<sup>32</sup> that relation does not fully explain why political organization should become more complex just because the economy can support it. Some theorists have suggested that competition between groups may be a more important reason for political consolidation. For example, Elman Service suggested competition as a reason why a society might change from a band level of political organization to a tribal level. Band societies are generally hunter-gatherers. With a changeover to agriculture, population density and competition between groups may increase. Service believes that such competition will foster the development of some informal organization beyond the community-namely, tribal organization-for offense and defense.<sup>33</sup> Indeed, as we saw in the chapters on residence and kinship and associations, unilineal kinship groups and age-set systems both seem to be associated with warfare.

Among agriculturalists, defensive needs might also be the main reason for switching from informal multivillage political organization to more formal chiefdom organization. Formally organized districts are probably more likely to defeat autonomous villages or even segmentary lineage systems.<sup>34</sup> In addition, there may be economic reasons for political development. With regard to chiefdoms, Service suggested that chiefdoms will emerge when redistribution between communities becomes important or when large-scale coordinated work groups are required. The more important these activities are, the more important (and hence more "chiefly") the organizer and his family presumably become.<sup>35</sup> But redistribution is far from a universal activity of chiefs,<sup>36</sup> so Service's explanation of chiefdoms is probably not sufficient either by itself.

Theory and research on the anthropology of political development have focused mostly on the high end of the scale of political complexity, and particularly on the origins of the first state societies. Those earliest states apparently arose independently of one another, after about 3500 B.C., in what is now southern Iraq, Egypt, northwestern India, northern China, and central Mexico. Several theories have been proposed to explain the earliest states, but no one theory seems to fit all of the known archaeological sequences culminating in early state formation. The reason may be that different conditions in different places favored the emergence of centralized government. The state, by definition, implies the power to organize large populations for collective purposes. In some areas, the purpose may have been the need to organize necessary local or longdistance trade or both. In other cases, the state may have emerged as a way to control defeated populations that could not flee. In still other instances, other factors or a combination of factors may have fostered the development of the state type of political system. It is still not clear what the specific conditions were that led to the emergence of the state in each of the early centers.<sup>37</sup>

#### The Spread of State Societies

For whatever reasons the earliest states developed, the state level of political development has come to dominate the world. Societies with states have larger communities and higher population densities than do band, tribal, and chiefdom societies. They also have armies that are ready to fight at almost any time. State systems that have waged war against chiefdoms and tribes have almost always won, and the result has usually been the political incorporation of the losers. For example, the British and later the United States colonization of much of North America led to the defeat and incorporation of many Native American societies.

The defeat and incorporation of the Native Americans was at least partially due to the catastrophic depopulations they suffered because of epidemic diseases (such as smallpox and measles) that colonists introduced. Catastrophic depopulation was commonly the outcome of the first contacts between Euro-Americans and the natives of North and South America, as well as the natives of the far islands in the Pacific. People in the New World and the Pacific had not previously been exposed (and therefore were not resistant) to the diseases the Euro-Americans carried with them when they began to colonize the world. Before the expansion of Europeans, the people of the New World and the Pacific had been separated for a long time from the people and diseases on that geographically continuous land mass we separate into Europe, Africa, and Asia. Smallpox, measles, and the other former scourges of Europe had largely become childhood diseases that most individuals of European ancestry survived.<sup>38</sup>

Whether by depopulation, conquest, or intimidation, the number of independent political units in the world has decreased strikingly in the last 3,000 years, and especially in the last 200 years.

Robert Carneiro estimated that in 1000 B.C., there may have been between 100,000 and 1 million separate political units in the world; today there are

*State societies frequently try to expand by conquering other* peoples, as the Spanish did in Mexico. This Aztec drawing depicts a 1530 Spanish battle in which a non-Aztec group fought together with the Spanish against another non-Aztec group.

fewer than 200.<sup>39</sup> In the ethnographic record, about 50 percent of the 2,000 or so societies described within the last 150 years had only local political integration. That is, the highest level of political integration in 1 out of 2 fairly recent societies was the local community.<sup>40</sup> Thus, most of the decrease in the number of independent political units has occurred fairly recently.

But the recent secessions from the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and other separatist movements around the world, suggest that ethnic rivalries may make for departures from the trend toward larger and larger political units. Ethnic groups that have been dominated by others in multinational states may opt for political autonomy, at least for a while. On the other hand, the separate nations of Western Europe are becoming more unified every day, both politically and economically. So the trend toward larger and larger political units may be continuing, even if there are departures from it now and then.

Extrapolating from past history, a number of investigators have suggested that the entire world will eventually come to be politically integrated, perhaps as soon as the twenty-third century and no later than A.D. 4850.<sup>41</sup> Only the future will tell if this prediction will come true. And only the future will tell if further political integration in the world will occur peacefully-with all parties agreeing-or by force or the threat of force, as has happened so often in the past.

#### VARIATION IN POLITICAL PROCESS

Anthropologists nowadays are increasingly interested in the politics, or political processes, of the societies they study: who acquires influence or power, how they acquire it, and how political decisions are made. But even though we have descriptive accounts of politics in many societies, there is as yet little comparative or cross-cultural research on what may explain variation in politics.<sup>42</sup>

#### Getting to Be a Leader

In those societies that have hereditary leadership, which is common in rank societies and in state societies with monarchies, rules of succession usually establish how leadership is inherited. Such leaders are often identifiable in some obviously visible way; they may be permanently marked or tattooed, as in chiefdoms in Polynesia, or they may wear elaborate dress and insignia, as in class-stratified societies (see the discussion of body adornment in the chapter on the arts). But for societies whose leaders are chosen (either as informal leaders or as political officials), we need a lot more research to understand why some kinds of people are chosen over others.

We do have a few studies that investigated the personal qualities of leaders in tribal societies. One study, conducted among the Mekranoti-Kayapo of central Brazil, found that leaders (in contrast to followers) tend to be rated by their peers as higher on intelligence, generosity, knowledgeability, ambitiousness, and aggressiveness. Leaders also tend to be older and taller. And despite the egalitarian nature of Mekranoti society (at least with respect to sharing resources), sons of leaders are more likely than others to become leaders.<sup>43</sup>

Research in another Brazilian society, the Kagwahiv of the Amazon region, suggests another personal quality of leaders—they seem to have positive feelings about their fathers and mothers.<sup>44</sup> In many respects, studies of leaders in the United States show them to be not that different from their counterparts in Brazil. But there is one major difference. Mekranoti and Kagwahiv leaders are not wealthier than others; in fact, they give their wealth away. U.S. leaders are wealthier than others.<sup>45</sup>

"Big Men". In some egalitarian tribal societies, the quest for leadership seems quite competitive. In parts of New Guinea and South America, "big men" compete with other ambitious men to attract followers. Men who want to compete must show that they have magical powers, success in gardening, and bravery in war. But, most important, they have to collect enough goods to throw big parties at which the goods are given away. Big men have to work very hard to attract and keep their followings; dissatisfied followers can always join other aspiring men.<sup>46</sup> The wives of big men are often leaders too. Among the Kagwahiv, for example, a headman's wife is usually the leader of the women in the community; she is responsible for much of the planning for feasts and often distributes the meat at them.<sup>47</sup>

Although the phenomenon of big men leaders is common throughout New Guinea, researchers are beginning to see variation in the type and extent of "bigmanship" in different areas of New Guinea. For example, in the southern Highlands, groups of men (not just big men) may engage in large-scale giveaways, so big men are not so different from ordinary men. In the northwestern Highlands, on the other hand, big men stand out from other men in striking ways. They make policy for groups of people and organize collective events, they have substantial access to pigs or to valuables acquired in exchanges, and they have control over a substantial amount of labor (more than one wife and fellow kin).<sup>48</sup>

So we know that some big men are bigger than others, but how does a man get to be a big man? Among the Kumdi-Engamoi, a central Highlands group, a man who wants to be considered a wua nium (literally a "great-important-wealthy man") needs to have many wives and daughters, because the amount of land controlled by a man and how much can be produced on that land depend on the number of women in his family. (The more wives he has, the more land he is given to cultivate.) He must also be a good speaker. Everyone has the right to speak and give speeches, but to get to be known as a big man requires speaking well and forcefully and knowing when to sum up a consensus. It usually takes a man until his thirties or forties to acquire more than one wife and to make his name through exchanges. When a man wants to inaugurate an exchange, he needs to get shells and pigs from his family and relatives. Once he has achieved a reputation as a *wua nium*, he can keep it only if he continues to perform well, that is, if he continues to distribute fairly, make wise decisions, speak well, and conduct exchanges.<sup>49</sup>

"Big Women". In contrast to most of mainland New Guinea, the islands off the southeastern coast are characterized by matrilineal descent. But like the rest of New Guinea, the islands also usually have a shifting system of leadership in which people compete for "big" status. Here, though, the people competing are women as well as men, and so there are "big women" as well as "big men." On the island of Vanatinai, for example, women and men compete with each other to exchange valuables. Women lead canoe expeditions to distant islands to visit male as well as female exchange partners, women mobilize relatives and exchange partners to mount large feasts, and the women get to keep the ceremonial valuables exchanged, at least for a while.<sup>50</sup>

The prominence of women on Vanatinai island may be linked to the disappearance of warfare (the colonial powers imposed peace—we call this "pacification"). Interisland exchanges grew in frequency when war became rarer in the early twentieth century, giving women and men more freedom to travel. For men, but not women, war provided a path to leadership—champion warriors would acquire great renown and influence. It is not that women did not participate in war; they did (which is

unusual cross-culturally). But a woman could not become a war leader. Now, in the absence of war, women have an opportunity (through exchanges) to become leaders, or "big women."

In one respect, however, women have less of an opportunity to acquire influence now. There are local government councils now, but all the councillors are male. Why? Some women were nominated for the posts, but they withdrew in embarrassment because they could not speak English. Big men or big women do not automatically have a path to these new positions—it is mostly young males who know English and become the councillors. But this situation may change. With the opening of a government primary school in 1984, girls and boys are both learning English, so women in the future may be more likely to achieve leadership by becoming councillors.

#### **Political Participation**

The political scientist Marc Ross conducted crosscultural research on variation in degree of political participation. As Ross phrased the research question: "Why is it that in some polities there are relatively large numbers of persons involved in political life, while in others political action is the province of very few?"51

Political participation in preindustrial societies ranges from widespread to low or nonexistent. Widespread participation (in 16 percent of the societies examined) means that decision-making forums are open to all adults (not necessarily that all adults participate); the forums may be formal (councils and other governing bodies) or informal. Next in degree of political participation are societies (37 percent) that have widespread participation by some but not all adults (men but not women, certain classes but not others). Next are societies (29 percent) that have some but not much input by the community. Finally, 18 percent of the societies have low or nonexistent participation, which means that leaders make most decisions and involvement of the average person is very limited.

Degree of political participation seems to be high in small-scale societies, as well as in modern democratic nation-states, but not in between (feudal states and preindustrial empires). Why? In small-scale societies leaders do not have the power to force people to act; thus a high degree of political participation may be the only way to get people to go along with decisions. In modern democracies, which have many powerful groups outside the government (corporations, unions, other associations), the central authorities may only theoretically have the power to force people to go along; in reality, they have to rely mostly on voluntary compliance. For example, the U.S. government failed when it tried with force (during Prohibition, 1920–1933) to stop the manufacture, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages.

A high degree of political participation seems to have an important consequence. In the modern world, democratically governed states rarely go to war with each other. This does not mean that modern democracies are more peaceful in general; on the contrary, they are as likely to go to war as other kinds of political systems, but not so much with each other.<sup>52</sup> So, for example, troops from the United States invaded three countries between 1980 and 1993 (Grenada, Panama, Iraq), but no democracies. Similarly, it appears that more participatory (more "democratic") political units in the ethnographic record fight with each other significantly less often than do less participatory political units, just as seems to be the case among modern nationstates.<sup>53</sup> Exactly why more participation or more democracy may lead to peace still remains to be established; we explore the implications of the relationship in our final chapter on applied anthropology and social problems.

## RESOLUTION OF CONFLICT

As we noted in the beginning of the chapter, political life involves more than the making of policy, its administration, and its enforcement. It also involves the resolution of conflict, which may be accomplished peacefully by avoidance, community action, mediation or the negotiation of compromises, apology, appeal to supernatural forces, or adjudication by a third party (for example, a court). As we shall see, the procedures used usually vary with degree of social complexity; decisions by third parties are more likely in more hierarchical societies.<sup>54</sup> But peaceful solutions are not always possible, and disputes may erupt into violent conflict. When violence occurs within a political unit in which disputes are usually settled peacefully, we call such violence crime, particularly when committed by an individual. When the violence occurs between groups of people from separate political units—groups between which there is no procedure for settling disputes—we usually call such violence warfare. (When violence occurs between subunits of a population that had been politically unified, we call it "civil war.")

#### Peaceful Resolution of Conflict

Most modern industrialized states have formal institutions and offices such as police, district attorneys, courts, and penal systems to deal with minor disputes and more serious conflicts that may arise in society. All these institutions generally operate according to codified laws—that is, a set of explicit (usually, written) rules stipulating what is permissible and what is not. Transgression of the law by individuals gives the state the right to take action against them. The state has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force in the society, for it alone has the right to coerce subjects into agreement with regulations, customs, political edicts, and procedures.

Many societies lack such specialized offices and institutions for dealing with conflict. Yet, because all societies have peaceful, regularized ways of handling at least certain disputes, some anthropologists speak of the universality of law. E. Adamson Hoebel, for example, stated the principle as follows:

> Each people has its system of social control. And all but a few of the poorest of them have as a part of the control system a complex of behavior patterns and institutional mechanisms that we may properly treat as law. For, "anthropologically considered, law is merely one aspect of our culturethe aspect which employs the force of organized society to regulate individual and group conduct and to prevent redress or punish deviations from prescribed social norms."55

Law, then, whether informal as in simpler societies, or formal as in more complex societies, provides a means of dealing peacefully with whatever conflicts develop. That does not mean that conflicts are always resolved peacefully.

Avoidance. Violence can often be avoided if the parties to a dispute voluntarily avoid each other or are separated until emotions cool down. Anthropologists have frequently remarked that foragers are particularly likely to make use of this technique. People may move to other bands or move their dwellings to opposite ends of camp. Shifting horticulturalists may also split up when conflicts get too intense. Avoidance is obviously easier in societies, such as band societies, that are nomadic or seminomadic and in which people have temporary dwellings. And avoidance is more feasible when people live independently and self-sufficiently (for example, in cities and suburbs).<sup>56</sup> But even if conditions in such societies may make avoidance

#### DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: HOW AND WHY ARE THEY RELATED?

The subsistence economies traditionally studied by anthropologists are becoming more and more commercialized as people increasingly produce goods and services for a market. And the pace of economic development is quickening, particularly in places that until recently lacked industrial wage labor, as their economies are increasingly integrated into the same world system. What effect, if any, does economic development have on political participation? Can we speculate about the future on the basis of comparative research?

٠.

Most of the comparative research on the relationship between economic development and political participation has been cross-national, comparing data on different countries. Some countries are more democratic than others, on the basis of traits such as contested elections, an elected head of state, an elected powerful legislature, and the protection of civil liberties. In capitalist countries, more democracy generally associated with is higher levels of economic development (as measured by indicators such as per capita output). In countries that are not very industrialized, there is little democracy at the national level. Why should more democracy be associated with more economic development? The prevailing opinion is that economic development increases the degree of social equality in the country, and the more equality among interest groups, the more they demand participation in the political process, and hence the more democracy. Or, to put this theory another way, as

the economy develops, the more what we might call the middle and working classes can demand rewards and power, and therefore the less power the elite can retain.

What about the societies usually studied by anthropologists (what we call the cross-cultural or ethnographic record)? We know that some of the highest levels of political participation occur in the least complex societies, such as foraging societies. Many adults in such societies have a say in decisions and leadership is informal; leaders can retain their roles only if people voluntarily go along with them. Concentrated power and less political participation are more likely in chiefdoms and states than in band and tribal societies. The more hierarchical chiefdoms and states usually depend on

![](_page_14_Picture_7.jpeg)

easier, we still need to know why some societies use avoidance more than confrontation as a way of resolving conflict.

Community Action. Societies have found various ways of resolving disputes peacefully. One such way involves action by a group or the community as a whole; collective action is common in simpler societies that lack powerful authoritarian leaders.<sup>57</sup> Many Inuit societies, for example, frequently resolve disputes through community action. Within local groups, kinship ties are not particularly emphasized, and the family is regarded as autonomous in most matters. They believe that spirits—particularly if displeased—can determine much of a person's fate. Consequently, people carry out their daily tasks within a complex system of taboos. This system of taboos is so extensive that the Inuit, at least in the past, may have had no need for a formal set of laws.

Nevertheless, conflicts do arise and have to be resolved. Accordingly, "principles" act as guides to the community in settling trouble cases. An individual's failure to heed a taboo or to follow the suggestions of a shaman leads to expulsion from the group, because the community cannot accept a risk to its livelihood. A person who fails to share goods voluntarily will find them confiscated and distributed to the community, and he or she may be executed in the process. A single case of murder, as an act of vengeance (usually because of the abduction of a wife or as part of a blood feud), does not conagriculture, particularly intensive agriculture, which can produce more goods and services per capita than foraging economies can. So the relationship between economic development and political participation in the ethnographic record is opposite to what we find cross-nationally. That is, the more economic development, the less political participation, in the societies studied by anthropologists. Why should this be so? It seems that social equality decreases with economic development in the ethnographic record (which does not include many industrialized societies). In that record, an economically developed society is likely to have features such as plowing, fertilizers, and irrigation, which make permanent cultivation of the fields and permanent communities possible. Such intensive agricultural activity is more conducive to concentrated wealth than is hunter-gatherer subsistence or shifting cultivation (horticulture). Thus, in the ethnographic record, the more economically developed societies have *more* social inequality and therefore less democracy.

The two sets of findings (the cross-national and the crosscultural) are not that hard to reconcile. Social (and economic) inequality appears to work against democracy and extensive political participation. Social inequality increases with the switch from foraging to agriculture. But social inequality decreases with the switch from preindustrial agriculture to high (industrial) levels of economic development. Political participation decreases with the first switch and increases with the second, because social inequality first increases and then decreases.

So what does comparative research suggest about the future? If the middle and working classes feel they are not getting a fair return on their labor, their demands should increase. The elite may be willing to satisfy those increased demands; if they do, their power will be reduced. Or the elite may be forced by the electoral process to accommodate those increased demands. In either case, unless the elite try to retain their power at any cost, there should be more political participation and more democracy, at least in the long run.

cern the community, but repeated murders do.

Franz Boas gave a typical example: There was a native of Padli by the name Padlu. He had induced the wife of a native of Cumberland Sound to desert her husband and follow him. The deserted husband, meditating revenge . . . visited his friends in Padli, but before he could accomplish his intention of killing Padlu, the latter shot him. . . . A brother of the murdered man went to Padli to avenge the death . . . but he also was killed by Padlu. A third native of Cumberland

> tives, was also murdered by him. On account of these outrages the natives wanted to get rid of Padlu, but yet they did not dare to attack him. When the pimain (headman) of the Akudmurmuit learned of these events he started south-

Sound, who wished to avenge the death of his rela-

ward and asked every man in Padli whether Padlu should be killed. All agreed; so he went with the latter deer hunting. . . and. . . shot Padlu in the back.<sup>58</sup>

The killing of an individual is the most extreme action a community can take—we call it capital punishment. The community as a whole or a political official or a court may decide to administer such punishment, but capital punishment seems to exist in nearly all societies, from the simplest to the most complex.<sup>59</sup> It is often assumed that capital punishment deters crime. If it did, we would expect the abolition of capital punishment to be followed by an increase in homicide rates. But that does not seem to happen. A cross-national study indicated that the abolition of capital punishment tends to be followed by a *decrease* in homicide rates.<sup>60</sup>

Negotiation and Mediation. In many conflicts, the parties to a dispute may come to a settlement themselves by negotiation. There aren't necessarily any rules for how they will do so, but any solution is "good" if it restores peace.<sup>61</sup>

Sometimes an outside or third party is used to help bring about a settlement between the disputants. We call it *mediation* when the outside person tries to help bring about a settlement, but that person does not have the formal authority to force a settlement. Both negotiation and mediation are likely when the society is relatively egalitarian and it is important for people to get along.<sup>62</sup> Among the Nuer of East Africa, a pastoral and horticultural people, disputes within the community can be settled with the help of an informal mediator called the "leopard-skin chief." This man is not a political chief but a mediator. His position is hereditary, has religious overtones, and makes its holder responsible for the social well-being of the district.

Matters such as cattle stealing rarely come to the attention of the leopard-skin chief; the parties involved usually prefer to settle in their own private way. But if, for example, a murder has been committed, the culprit will go at once to the house of the leopard-skin chief. Immediately the chief cuts the culprit's arm so that blood flows; until the cut has been made the murderer may not eat or drink. If the murderer is afraid of vengeance by the slain man's family, he will remain at the house of the leopard-skin chief, which is considered sanctuary. Then, within the next few months, the chief attempts to mediate between the parties to the crime.

The chief elicits from the slayer's kin that they are prepared to pay compensation to avoid a feud, and he persuades the dead man's kin that they ought to accept compensation, usually in the form of cattle. During this period neither party may eat or drink from the same vessels as the other, and they may not, therefore, eat in the house of the same third person. The chief then collects the cattlesome forty to fifty beasts—and takes them to the dead man's home, where he performs various sacrifices of cleansing and atonement.<sup>63</sup>

The chief acts throughout as a go-between. He has no authority to force either of the parties to negotiate, and he has no power to enforce a solution once it has been arrived at. However, he is able to take advantage of the fact that because both parties to the dispute belong to the same community and are anxious to avoid a blood feud, they usually are willing to come to terms.

Ritual Reconciliation—Apology. The desire to restore a harmonious relationship may also explain ceremonial apologies. An apology is based on deference—the guilty party shows obeisance and asks for forgiveness. Such ceremonies tend to occur in recent chiefdoms.<sup>64</sup> Among the Fijians of the South Pacific, there is a strong ethic of harmony and mutual assistance, particularly within a village. When a person offends someone of higher status, the offended person and other villagers begin to avoid, and gossip about, the offender. If the offender is sensitive to village opinion, he or she will perform a ceremony of apology called *i soro*. One of the meanings of soro is "surrender." In the ceremony the offender keeps her or his head bowed and remains silent while an intermediary speaks, presents a token gift, and asks the offended person for forgiveness. The apology is rarely rejected.<sup>65</sup>

*Oaths and Ordeals.* Still another way of peacefully resolving disputes is through oaths and ordeals, both of which involve appeals to supernatural power. An oath is the act of calling upon a deity to bear witness to the truth of what one says. An ordeal is a means used to determine guilt or innocence by submitting the accused to dangerous or painful tests believed to be under supernatural control.<sup>66</sup>

Oaths, as one would expect, vary widely in content according to the culture in which they are found. The Rwala Bedouin, for example, do the following:

> In serious disputes the judge requires the *msabba* oath, so called from the seven lines drawn with a saber on the ground. The judge first draws a circle with a saber, then its diameter; then he intersects with five vertical lines, inviting the witness to step inside and, facing south, to swear: "A false oath is the ruin of the descendants, for he who [swears falsely] is insatiable in his desire [of gain] and does not fear for his Lord."67

Scarcely is the oath finished when the witness jumps out of the circle and, full of rage, runs at his opponent, who has made him swear. The people present at the trial have to surround and hold him until he calms down.

A common kind of ordeal, found in almost every part of the world, is scalding. Among the Tanala of Madagascar, the accused person, having first had his hand carefully examined for protective covering, has to reach his hand into a cauldron of boiling water and grasp, from underneath, a rock suspended there. He then plunges his hand into cold

water, has it bandaged, and is led off to spend the night under guard. In the morning his hand is unbandaged and examined. If there are blisters, he is guilty.

Oaths and ordeals have also been practiced in Western societies. Both were common in medieval Europe. Even today, in our own society, vestiges of oaths can be found: children can be heard to say "Cross my heart and hope to die," and witnesses in courts of law are obliged to swear to tell the truth.

Why do some societies use oaths and ordeals? John Roberts suggested that they tend to be found in fairly complex societies in which political officials lack sufficient power to make and enforce judicial decisions or would make themselves unnecessarily vulnerable were they to attempt to do so. So the officials may use oaths and ordeals to let the gods decide guilt or innocence. When political officials gain more power, oaths and ordeals seem to decline or disappear.<sup>68</sup> In contrast, smaller and less complex societies probably have no need for elaborate mechanisms such as courts and oaths and ordeals to ascertain guilt. In such societies, everyone is aware of what crimes have been committed and who the guilty parties probably are.

Adjudication, Courts, and Codified Law. We call it adjudication when a third party acting as judge makes a decision that the disputing parties have to accept. Judgment may be rendered by one person (a judge), a panel of judges, a jury, or a political agent or agency (a chief, a royal personage, a council). Courts are often open to an audience, but they need not be. Judges and courts may rely on codified law and stipulated punishments, but codified law is not necessary for decisions to be made. Our own society relies heavily on codified law and courts to resolve disputes peacefully, but courts often if not usually rely on precedent (the outcomes of previous, similar cases). Codified laws and courts are not limited to Western societies. From the late seventeenth to the early twentieth century, for example, the Ashanti of West Africa had a complex political system with elaborate legal arrangements. The Ashanti state was a military-based empire possessing legal codes that resembled those of many ancient civilizations.<sup>69</sup>

The most effective sanction underpinning Ashanti law and its enforcement was the intense respect-almost religious deference-accorded the wishes of the ancestors and also the elders as custodians of the ancestral tradition. Ashanti law was based on a concept of natural law-a belief that there is an order of the universe whose principles lawmakers should follow in the decisions they make and in the regulations they design. Criminal and religious law were merged by the Ashanti: crimes—especially homicide, cursing of a chief, cowardice, and sorcery-were regarded as sins against the ancestral spirits. In Ashanti court procedure, elders examined and cross-examined witnesses as well as parties to the dispute. There were also quasiprofessional advocates, and appeals against a verdict could be made directly to a chief. Particularly noteworthy was the emphasis on intent when assessing guilt. Drunkenness constituted a valid defense for all crimes except murder and cursing a chief, and a plea of insanity, if proved, was upheld for all offenses.

Ashanti punishments could be severe. Physical mutilation, such as slicing off the nose or an ear-even castration in sexual offenses-was often employed. Fines were more frequent, however, and death sentences could often be commuted to banishment and confiscation of goods.

Why do some societies have codified systems while others do not? One explanation, advanced by E. Adamson Hoebel, A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, and others, is that in small, closely knit communities there is little need for formal legal guidelines because competing interests are minimal. Hence, simple societies need little codified law: there are relatively few matters to quarrel about, and the general will of the group is sufficiently well known and demonstrated frequently enough to deter transgressors.

This point of view is echoed in Richard Schwartz's study of two Israeli settlements. In one communal kibbutz, a young man aroused a good deal of community resentment because he had accepted an electric teakettle as a gift. It was the general opinion that he had overstepped the code about not having personal possessions, and he was so informed. Accordingly, he gave the kettle to the communal infirmary. Schwartz observed that "no organized enforcement of the decision was threatened, but had he disregarded the expressed will of the community, his life . . . would have been made intolerable by the antagonism of public opinion."70

In this community, where people worked and ate together, not only did everyone know about transgressions, but a wrongdoer could not escape public censure. Thus, public opinion was an effective sanction. In another Israeli community, however, where individuals lived in widely separated houses and worked and ate separately, public opinion did not work as well. Not only were community members less aware of problems, but they had no quick way of making their feelings known. As a result, they established a judicial body to handle trouble cases.

Larger, more heterogeneous and stratified societies are likely to have more frequent disputes, which at the same time are less visible to the public. Individuals in stratified societies are generally not so dependent on community members for their wellbeing and hence are less likely to know of, or care about, others' opinions. It is in such societies that codified laws and formal authorities for resolving disputes develop—in order, perhaps, that disputes may be settled impersonally enough so that the parties can accept the decision and social order can be restored.

A good example of how more formal systems of law develop is the experience of towns in the American West during the gold-rush period. These communities were literally swamped by total strangers. The townsfolk, having no control (authority) over these intruders because the strangers had no local ties, looked for ways to deal with the troublesome cases that were continually flaring up. A first attempt at a solution was to hire gunslingers—who were also strangers—to act as peace officers or sheriffs, but this strategy usually failed. Eventually, towns succeeded in having federal authorities send in marshals backed by federal power.

Is there some evidence to support the theory that codified law is necessary only in larger, more complex societies? Data from a large, worldwide sample of societies suggest that codified law is associated with political integration beyond the local level. Murder cases, for example, are dealt with informally in societies that have only local political organization. In societies with multilocal political units, murder cases tend to be judged or adjudicated by specialized political authorities.<sup>71</sup> There is also some cross-cultural evidence that violence within a society tends to be less frequent when there are formal authorities (chiefs, courts) who have the power to punish murderers.<sup>72</sup> In general, adjudication or enforced decisions by outside authorities tend to occur in hierarchical societies with social classes and centralized power.<sup>73</sup>

#### Violent Resolution of Conflict

People are likely to resort to violence when regular, effective alternative means of resolving a conflict are not available. Some societies consider violence be-

Many societies have adopted peaceful ways of resolving disputes, even between different societies. This meeting between the Hopi and the Navaho of the U.S. Southwest is an attempt to work out a dispute between them.

#### NEW COURTS ALLOW WOMEN TO ADDRESS GRIEVANCES IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA

In most societies in New Guinea, women did not traditionally participate in the resolution of disputes. And they could not themselves bring actions against men. But when village courts were introduced, women began to go to court to redress offenses against them.

In colonial times, the introduced Western-style courts followed Western law (primarily Australian and British common law), not native customary law. After Papua New Guinea became an independent country, those courts remained in place. The lowest of the courts, called Local Courts, were located in town centers, often far from villages, so villagers rarely brought cases to them. But in 1973 a new kind of court was created. Called Village Courts, they were designed to settle local disputes in the villages, using a blend of customary law (relying on compromise) and Western law. In contrast to the Local Courts, magistrates in the Village Courts were not outsiders but were selected from the pool of traditional and local leaders who knew the local people.

When Richard Scaglion studied changes in village courts among the Abelam from 1977 to 1987, he noticed a shift toward the increased use of these courts by women. In 1977, most of the complainants were male, but by 1987 most of them were female. In a wider study of court cases over many regions of Papua New Guinea, Scaglion and Rose Whittingham found that most of the cases in which women were the plaintiffs were attempts to redress sex-related offenses (sexual jealousy, rape, incest, domestic disputes) committed by males. Most disputes in New Guinea villages are settled informally by self-help or by appeal to a "big man"; the courts are appealed to only as a last resort. But serious sex-related cases are unlikely to be settled informally and are more likely to be settled in the Village Court. Apparently women do not believe that they can

get satisfaction informally. So they go to the Village Court, where they win some sort of punishment for the defendant in about 60 percent of the cases, just about the same rate that men achieve when they bring a case seeking punishment.

Culture change introduced from the outside often works against native peoples. But Papuan New Guinea women have benefited from the new Village Court system, particularly in redressing grievances against males. The traditional system for resolving disputes was largely maledominated (women could not be plaintiffs) and so the possibility of taking disputes to the new courts has given women some measure of legal equality with men.

tween individuals to be appropriate under certain circumstances; we generally do not and call it crime. When violence occurs between political entities such as communities, districts, or nations, we call it warfare. The type of warfare, of course, varies in scope and complexity from society to society. Sometimes a distinction is made among feuding, raiding, and large-scale confrontations.

Some scholars talk about a cultural pattern of violence. But are some cultures more violent than

others? The answer seems to be yes. More often than not, societies with one type of violence have others. Societies with more war tend to have warlike sports, malevolent magic, severe punishment for crimes, high murder rates, feuding, and family violence. What might explain this tendency? One suggestion is that if war is frequent, the society may have to encourage boys to be aggressive, so that they can grow up to be effective warriors. But this socializing for aggression can spill over into other areas of life; high rates of crime and other violence may be inadvertent or unintended consequences of the encouragement of aggressiveness.74

Individual Violence. Although it may at first seem paradoxical, violent behavior itself is often used to try to control behavior. In some societies it is considered necessary for parents to beat children who misbehave. They don't consider this criminal behavior or child abuse; they consider it punishment (see our discussion of family violence in the chapter on applied anthropology and social problems). Similar views may attach to interpersonal behavior between adults. If a person trespasses on your property or hurts someone in your family, some societies consider it appropriate or justified to kill or maim the trespasser. Is this social control, or is it just lack of control? Most societies have norms about when such "punishment" is or is not appropriate, so the behavior of anyone who contemplates doing something wrong, as well as the behavior of the person wronged, is likely to be influenced by the "laws" of their society. For example, systems of individual self-help are characteristic of egalitarian societies.<sup>75</sup> How is this different from "community action," which we classified above under peaceful resolution of conflict? Because community action is explicitly based on obtaining a consensus, it is likely to lead to the ending of a particular dispute. Individual action, or selfhelp, particularly if it involves violence, is not.

Feuding. *Feuding* is an example of how individual self-help may not lead to a peaceful resolution of conflict. Feuding is a state of recurring hostilities between families or groups of kin, usually motivated by a desire to avenge an offense—whether insult, injury, deprivation, or death—against a member of the group. The most characteristic feature of the feud is that responsibility to avenge is carried by all members of the kin group. The killing of any member of the offender's group is considered appropriate revenge, because the kin group as a whole is regarded as responsible. Nicholas Gubser told of a feud within a Nunamiut Inuit community, caused by a husband's killing of his wife's lover, that lasted for decades. The Nunamiut take feuds seriously, as do many societies, especially when murder has been committed. Gubser described what happens when a man is killed:

> The closely related members of his kindred do not rest until complete revenge has been achieved. The immediate relatives of the deceased . . . recruit as much support from other relatives as they can.

Their first action, if possible, is to kill the murderer, or maybe one of his closest kin. Then, of course, the members of the murderer's kindred are brought into the feud. These two kindreds may snipe at each other for years.<sup>76</sup>

Feuds are by no means limited to small-scale societies; they occur as frequently in societies with high levels of political organization.<sup>77</sup>

Raiding. Raiding is a short-term use of force, planned and organized, to realize a limited objective. This objective is usually the acquisition of goods, animals, or other forms of wealth belonging to another (often a neighboring) community.

Raiding is especially prevalent in pastoral societies, in which cattle, horses, camels, or other animals are prized and an individual's own herd can be augmented by theft. Raids are often organized by temporary leaders or coordinators whose authority may not endure beyond the planning and execution of the venture. Raiding may also be organized for the purpose of capturing people. Sometimes people are taken to marry (the capture of women to be wives or concubines is fairly common)<sup>78</sup> or to be slaves. Slavery has been practiced in about 33 percent of the world's known societies; war has been one way of obtaining slaves either to keep or to trade for other goods.<sup>79</sup>

Large-Scale Confrontations. Both feuding and raiding usually involve relatively small numbers of persons and almost always an element of surprise. Because they are generally attacked without warning, the victims are often unable to muster an immediate defense. Large-scale confrontations, in contrast, involve a large number of persons and planning by both sides of strategies of attack and defense.

Large-scale warfare is usually practiced among societies with intensive agriculture or industrialization. Only these societies possess a technology sufficiently advanced to support specialized armies, military leaders, strategists, and so on. But large-scale confrontations are not limited to state societies: they occur, for example, among the horticultural Dugum Dani of central New Guinea.

The military history of the Dani, with its shifting alliances and confederations, is reminiscent of that of Europe, although Dani battles involve far fewer fighters and less sophisticated weaponry. Among the Dani, long periods of ritual warfare are characterized by formal battles announced through a challenge sent by one side to the opposing side. If the challenge is accepted, the protagonists meet at

the agreed-upon battle site to set up their lines. Fighting with spears, sticks, and bows and arrows begins at midmorning and continues either until nightfall or until rain intervenes. There may also be a rest period during the midday heat during which the two sides shout insults at each other or talk and rest among themselves.

The front line of battle is composed of about a dozen active warriors and a few leaders. Behind them is a second line, still within arrow range, composed of those who have just left the forward line or are preparing to join it. The third line, outside arrow range, is composed of noncombatants-males too old or too young to participate and those recovering from wounds. This third line merely watches the battle taking place on the grassy plain. On the hillsides far back from the front line, some of the old men help to direct ancestral ghosts to the battle by gouging a line in the ground that points in the direction of the battlefield.<sup>80</sup>

Yet, as total as large-scale confrontations may be, even warfare has cultural rules. Among the Dani, for instance, no fighting occurs at night, and weapons are limited to simple spears and bows and arrows. Similarly, in state societies, governments will sign "self-denying" pacts restricting the use of poison gas, germ warfare, and so forth. Unofficially, private arrangements are common. One has only to glance through the memoirs of national leaders of the two world wars to become aware of locally arranged truces, visits to one another's front positions, exchanges of prisoners of war, and so on.

#### **Explaining Warfare**

Most societies anthropology knows about have had warfare between communities or larger territorial groups. (The vast majority of the societies in a recent cross-cultural study had at least occasional wars when they were first described, unless they had been pacified or incorporated by more dominant societies.<sup>81</sup>) Yet relatively little research has been done on the possible causes of war and why it varies in type and frequency. Why have some people fought a great deal, and others only infrequently? Why in some societies does warfare occur internally (within the society or language group)?

We have tentative and perhaps only partial answers to some of those questions. There is evidence that people in preindustrial societies go to war mostly out of fear-particularly a fear of expectable but unpredictable natural disasters (e.g., droughts, floods, locust infestations) that will destroy food resources. People may think they can protect themselves against such disasters ahead of time by taking things from defeated enemies. In any case, preindustrial societies with higher frequencies of war are very likely to have had a history of expectable but unpredictable disasters. The fact that chronic (annually recurring and therefore predictable) food shortages do not predict higher frequencies of war suggests that people go to war in an attempt to cushion the impact of the disasters they expect to occur in the future but cannot predict. Consistent with this tentative conclusion is the fact that the victors in war almost always take land or other resources from the defeated. And this is true for simpler as well as more complex preindustrial societies.<sup>82</sup> Might similar motives affect decisions about war and peace in the modern world?

We know that complex or politically centralized societies are likely to have professional armies, hierarchies of military authority, and sophisticated weapons.<sup>83</sup> But surprisingly, the frequency of warfare seems to be not much greater in complex societies than in simple band or tribal societies.<sup>84</sup>

We have some evidence that warfare is unlikely to occur internally (within a society) if it is small in population  $(21,000 \text{ or fewer people})$  or territory; in a larger society there is a high likelihood of warfare within the society, between communities or larger territorial divisions.<sup>85</sup> In fact, complex societies, even if they are politically unified, are not less likely than simpler societies to have internal warfare.<sup>86</sup>

What, if anything, do we know about recent warfare between nation-states? Here we also have some surprising findings. Although many people think that military alliances lessen the chance of war, it turns out that nations formally allied with other nations have gone to war more often than nations lacking formal alliances. Also, trade relationships do not appear to lessen the chance of war. Rather, disputes between trading partners escalate to war more frequently than disputes between nations that do not trade much with each other. Finally, military equality between nations, particularly when preceded by a rapid military buildup, seems to increase rather than lessen the chance of war between those nations.<sup>87</sup>

Clearly, these findings contradict some traditional beliefs about how to prevent war. If alliances, trade, and military buildups do not make war less likely, what may? We have already noted that participatory ("democratic") political systems are less likely to go to war with each other than are authoritarian political systems. Later, in the chapter on applied anthropology and social problems, we discuss how the results of these studies may translate into policies that could minimize the risk of war in the world.

#### V SUMMARY

1. All societies have customs or procedures that, organized on behalf of territorial groups, result in decision making and the resolution of disputes. These ways of creating and maintaining social order and coping with social disorder vary from society to society.

2. Societies with a band type of political organization are composed of fairly small, usually nomadic groups. Each of these bands is politically autonomous, the band being the largest group that acts as a political unit. Authority within the band is usually informal. Societies with band organization generally are egalitarian hunter-gatherers. But band organization may not have been typical of food collectors in the distant past.

Societies with tribal organization are sim-3. ilar to those with band organization in being egalitarian. But in contrast with band societies, they generally are food producers, have a higher population density, and are more sedentary. Tribal organization is defined by the presence of groupings (such as clans and age-sets) that can integrate more than one local group into a larger whole.

4. The personal qualities of leaders in tribal societies seem to be similar to the qualities of leaders in the United States, with one major difference: United States leaders are wealthier than others in their society.

5. Chiefdom organization differs from tribal organization in having formal authority structures that integrate multicommunity political units. Compared with societies with tribal organization, societies with chiefdoms are more densely populated and their communities are more permanent. In contrast to "big men" in tribal societies, who generally have to earn their privileges by their personal qualities, chiefs generally hold their positions permanently. Most chiefdom societies have social ranking.

6. A state has been defined as a political unit composed of many communities and having a cen-
