# Sex, Gender, and Culture

![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg)

We all know that humans come in two major varieties-female and male. The contrast is one of the facts of life we share with most animal species. But the fact that males and females always have different organs of reproduction does not explain why males and females may also differ in some other physical ways. After all, there are many animal species-such as pigeons, gulls, and laboratory rats-in which the two sexes differ little in appearance.<sup>1</sup> Thus, the fact that we are a species with two sexes does not really explain why human females and males typically look different. Also, the fact that humans reproduce sexually does not explain why human males and females should differ in behavior or be treated differently by society. Yet no society we know of treats females and males in exactly the same way; indeed, females usually have fewer advantages than males. That is why in the last chapter we were careful to say that egalitarian societies have no social groups with unequal access to resources, power, and prestige. But within social groups (for example, families), even egalitarian societies usually allow males greater access to resources, power, and prestige.

Because many of the differences between females and males may reflect cultural expectations and experiences, many researchers now prefer to speak of **gender differences** (reserving the term *sex* differences for purely biological differences).<sup>2</sup> Unfortunately, biological and cultural influences are not always clearly separable, so it is sometimes hard to know which term to use. As long as societies treat males and females differently, we may not be able to separate the effects of biology from the effects of culture, and both may be present. Although we focus in this chapter on differences and similarities between females and males, it is important to keep in mind that not all cultures conceive of gender as including just two categories. Sometimes "maleness" and "femaleness" are thought of as opposite ends of a continuum, or there might be three or more categories of gender (such as "female," "male," and "other").<sup>3</sup>

In this chapter we discuss what we know crossculturally about how and why females and males may differ physically, in gender roles, and in personality. We also discuss how and why sexual behavior, and attitudes about sex, vary from culture to culture.

# SEX AND GENDER DIFFERENCES

#### Physique and Physiology

As we noted at the outset, males and females of many animal species cannot readily be distinguished. Although they differ in chromosome

makeup and in their external and internal organs of reproduction, they do not differ otherwise. In contrast, humans are sexually dimorphicâ€”that is, the females and males of our species exhibit fairly marked differences in size and appearance. Females have proportionately wider pelvises. Males typically are taller and have heavier skeletons than females. Females have a larger proportion of their body weight in fat; males have a larger proportion of body weight in muscle. Males typically have greater grip strength, proportionately larger hearts and lungs, and greater aerobic work capacity (greater maximum uptake of oxygen during exercise).

There is a tendency in our society to view "taller" and "more muscled" as better, which may reflect the bias toward males in our culture. Natural selection may have favored these traits in males but different ones in females. For example, because females bear children, selection may have favored earlier cessation of growth (and therefore less ultimate height) in females so that the nutritional needs of a fetus would not compete with a growing mother's needs.<sup>4</sup> (Females achieve their ultimate height shortly after puberty, but boys continue to grow for longer after puberty.) Similarly, there is some evidence that females are less affected than males by nutritional shortages, presumably because they tend to be shorter and have proportionately more fat.<sup>5</sup> Natural selection may have favored those traits in females if they resulted in greater reproductive success.

Female and male athletes can build up their muscle strength and increase their aerobic work capacity through training. Given that fact, then, cultural factors (such as how much a society expects and allows males and females to engage in muscular activity) could influence the degree to which females and males differ muscularly and in aerobic work capacity. Similar training may account for the recent trend toward decreasing differences between females and males in certain athletic events, such as marathons and swim meets.

Even when it comes to female and male physique and physiology, then, what we see may be the result of both culture and genes.<sup>6</sup>

#### Gender Roles

*Productive and Domestic Activities.* In the chapter on economic systems, we noted that all societies assign or divide labor at least somewhat differently between females and males. Because role assignments have a clear cultural component, we can speak of them as gender roles. What is of particular interest here about the gender division of labor is not so much that every society has different work

![](_page_2_Picture_0.jpeg)

Training can increase muscle strength and aerobic work capacity. As women get more involved in competitive sports, we can expect their records to improve and the differences between male and female performance to decrease.

for males and females, but rather that so many societies divide up work in similar ways. The question, then, is why there are universal or near-universal patterns in such assignments.

Table 9-1 summarizes the worldwide patterns. We note which activities are performed by which gender in all or almost all societies, which activities are usually performed by one gender, and which activities are commonly assigned to either gender or both. Does the distribution of activities in the table suggest why females and males generally do different things?

One possible explanation may be labeled the strength theory. The greater strength of males, and their superior capacity to mobilize strength in quick bursts of energy (because of their greater aerobic work capacity), has commonly been cited as the reason for the universal or near-universal patterns in

the division of labor by gender. Certainly, activities that require lifting heavy objects (hunting large animals, butchering, clearing land, working with stone, metal, or lumber), throwing weapons, and running with great speed (as in hunting) may generally be performed best by males. And none of the activities females usually perform, with the possible exception of collecting firewood, seems to require the same degree of physical strength or quick bursts of energy. But the strength theory is not completely convincing, if only because it cannot readily explain all the observed patterns. For example, it is not clear that the male activities of trapping small animals, collecting wild honey, or making musical instruments require much physical strength.

Another possible explanation of the worldwide patterns in division of labor can be called the compatibility-with-child-care theory. The argument here is that women's tasks tend to be those that are compatible with child care. Although males can take care of infants, most traditional societies rely on breast-feeding of infants, which men cannot do. (In most societies, women breast-feed their children for two years on the average.) Women's tasks may be those that do not take them far from home for long periods, that do not place children in potential danger if they are taken along, and that can be stopped and resumed if an infant needs care.7

The compatibility theory may explain why *no* activities other than infant care are listed in the right-hand column of Table 9-1. That is, it may be that there are practically no universal or nearuniversal women-only activities because until recently most women have had to devote much of their time to nursing and caring for infants, as well as usually caring for other children. The compatibility theory may also explain why men usually do tasks such as hunting, trapping, fishing, collecting honey, lumbering, and mining. Those tasks are dangerous for infants to be around and in any case would be difficult to coordinate with infant care.<sup>8</sup>

Finally, the compatibility theory may also explain why men seem to take over certain crafts in societies with full-time specialization. Although the distinction is not shown in Table  $9-1$ , crafts such as making baskets, mats, and pottery are women's activities in noncommercial societies but tend to be men's activities in societies with full-time craft specialists.<sup>9</sup> Cooking is a good example in our own society. Women may be fine cooks, but chefs and bakers tend to be men, even though women traditionally do most of the cooking at home. Women might be more likely to work as cooks and chefs if

they could leave their babies and young children in safe places to be cared for by other people.

But the compatibility theory does not explain why men usually prepare soil for planting, make things (such as musical instruments) out of wood, or work bone, horn, and shell. All of those tasks could probably be stopped to tend to a child, and none of them is any more dangerous to children nearby than is cooking. Why, then, do males tend to do them? Additional considerations, such as economy of effort, may help explain patterns that cannot readily be explained by the strength and compatibility theories. For example, it may be advantageous for men to make musical instruments because men generally collect the hard materials involved (for example, by lumbering).<sup>10</sup> And because they collect those materials, men may be more knowledgeable about their physical properties and so more likely to know how to work with them. The economy-ofeffort interpretation also suggests that it would be advantageous for one gender to perform tasks that are located near each other. Thus, if women have to be near home to take care of young children, it would be economical for them to do other chores that are located in or near the home.

A fourth explanation of division of labor can be called the expendability theory. This theory suggests that men, rather than women, will tend to do the dangerous work in a society because men are more expendable, because the loss of men is less disadvantageous reproductively than the loss of women. If some men lose their lives in hunting,

Certain tasks are incompatible with child care. Although tilling a field and carrying a child are not the easiest tasks, this peasant woman in Chikoku, Japan, is clearly managing to do both at the same time.

deep-water fishing, mining, quarrying, lumbering, and the like, reproduction need not suffer so long as most fertile women have sexual access to men, as for example if the society permits two or more women to be married to the same man.<sup>11</sup> When would anybody, male or female, be willing to do dangerous work? Perhaps only when society glorifies the roles and endows them with high prestige and other rewards.

Although the various theories, singly or in combination, seem to explain much of the division of labor by gender, there are some unresolved problems. Critics of the strength theory have pointed out that in some societies women engage in very heavy labor.<sup>12</sup> If women in some societies can develop the strength to do such work, perhaps strength is more a function of training than we have traditionally believed.

The compatibility theory also has some problems. It suggests that labor is divided to conform to the requirements of child care. But sometimes it seems the other way around. For example, women who spend a good deal of time in agricultural work outside the home often ask others to watch and feed their infants while they are unavailable to nurse.<sup>13</sup> Consider too the mountain areas of Nepal, where agricultural work is quite incompatible with child care; heavy loads must be carried up and down steep slopes, fields are far apart, and labor takes up most of the day. Yet women do this work anyway and leave their infants with others for long stretches of time.<sup>14</sup> And in some societies women hunt: one of the activities most incompatible with child care and generally not done by women. For example, many Agta women of the Philippines regularly hunt wild pig and deer; women alone or in groups kill almost 30 percent of the large game.<sup>15</sup> The women's hunting does not seem to be incompatible with child care. Women take nursing babies on hunting trips, and the women who hunt do not have lower reproductive rates than the women who choose not to hunt. Of course, Agta women may find it possible to hunt because the hunting grounds are only about a half-hour from camp, the dogs that accompany the women assist in the hunting and protect the women and babies, and the women generally hunt in groups, so others can help carry babies as well as carcasses.

As the cases just described suggest, we need to know a lot more about labor requirements. More precisely, we need to know exactly how much strength is required in particular tasks, exactly how dangerous those tasks are, and whether a person could stop working at a task to care for a child. So far, we have mostly guesses. When there is more systematically collected evidence on such aspects of particular tasks, we will be in a better position to evaluate the theories we have discussed. In any case, it should be noted that none of the available theories implies that the worldwide patterns of division of labor shown in Table 9â€“1 will persist. As we know from our own and other industrial societies, when machines replace human strength, when women have fewer children, and when women can assign child care to others, a strict gender division of labor begins to disappear.

Relative Contributions to Subsistence. In our society, the stereotype of the husband is that he is the breadwinner in the family; the wife is the manager

#### WOMEN'S ELECTORAL SUCCESS ON THE NORTHWEST COAST

Political life has changed dramatically since first contact with Europeans for most Native American groups, including the Coast Salish of western Washington State and British Columbia. With impetus from the U.S. and Canadian governments, each of the recognized Coast Salish communities now has an elected council. But who is getting elected? Even though women did not have much of a role in traditional politics, now the Coast Salish groups are electing a lot of women. From the 1960s to the 1980s, women held over 40 percent of the council seats in the twelve Washington State groups, and in the 1990s women held 28 percent of the seats in the fifty British Columbian groups. What accounts for the women's electoral success? And why does that success vary from one group to another, even though the groups are closely related culturally? (The proportion of women on the councils varies from 6 percent among the Tulalip to 62 percent among the Stillaguamish.)

According to Bruce Miller, who did a comparative study of women's electoral success in Coast Salish communities, women generally have more of a political role now perhaps because new economic opportunities in the service and technical sectors allow women to contribute more to the household economy. But why do women win proportionately more council seats in some communities than in others? Miller found that women win proportionately more seats in communities with less income, the least income derived from fishing, and the smallest populations. Why should lower household income predict more electoral success for women? Miller suggests that it is not so much the amount of income but rather the degree to which women (compared with men) contribute to household income. In groups with economic difficulties, the jobs women are able to get play a vital role in the household. Women were helped by federally funded programs (such as the War on Poverty) to acquire technical skills and jobs. Simultaneously, many men in some communities lost their jobs in logging and agriculture.

But a high dependence on

fishing income seems to favor men politically. Families that operate purse-seine vessels to catch fish at sea can make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Such fishing is predominantly done by men, and where there is such lucrative fishing, the successful men dominate the councils. Even though women may have jobs too, their income is not as great as the successful fisherman's.

Why should women be more successful politically in smaller communities? Miller suggests that women have a better chance to be known personally when the community is small, even though working outside the home in technical or service jobs cuts down on the time women can devote to tribal ceremonials and other public events.

Does female income relative to male and community size help explain the relative political success of women elsewhere? We do not yet know, but subsequent research may help us find out.

of the house and children. As we know, the stereotype is becoming more myth than reality; in addition to the many women who are single parents, many married women (in the United States, more than 50 percent) now work outside the home. Among married women with children 6-17 years old, more than 70 percent are employed.<sup>16</sup>

The concept of breadwinner in our society emphasizes the person-traditionally the male-who "brings in the bread" (the food, or money to buy it)

from the outside. In focusing on the breadwinner, however, we may minimize the contributions of the person who works primarily inside the home.

How should we judge who contributes more to subsistence? Most anthropologists distinguish between primary subsistence activities and secondary **subsistence activities** (see Table  $9-1$ ). The primary activities are the food-getting activities discussed earlier: gathering, hunting, fishing, herding, and agriculture. Many of the secondary activities involve preparing and processing food for eating or storing. We know a considerable amount about how and possibly why women's and men's relative contributions to primary subsistence activities vary cross-culturally. We know much less about contributions to secondary subsistence activities. Researchers have focused mostly on primary subsistence activities, and they usually measure how much each gender's work in these activities contributes to the diet (in terms of caloric intake). Alternatively, contribution to primary subsistence activities (which are generally "outside" activities, away from the home) can be measured in terms of time spent doing them. Measures of caloric versus time contribution, however, can vield very different results. As we saw in the chapter on getting food, more time is spent by the YanomamÃ¶ in hunting than in horticulture, but horticulture yields more calories.

In some societies women have traditionally contributed more to the economy than men by any measure. For example, among the Tchambuli of New Guinea in the 1930s the women did all the fishing-going out early in the morning by canoe to their fish traps and returning when the sun was hot. Some of the catch was traded for sago (a starch) and sugarcane, and it was the women who went on the long canoe trips to do the trading.<sup>17</sup>

The stereotype of husband as breadwinner no longer fits our society. But it does fit the Toda of India, as they were described early in the twentieth century. They depended for subsistence almost entirely on the dairy products of their water buffalo, either by using the products directly or by selling them for grain. Women were not allowed to have anything to do with dairy work; only men tended the buffalo and prepared the dairy products. Women's work was largely household work. Women prepared the purchased grain for cooking, cleaned house, and decorated clothing.<sup>18</sup>

A survey of a wide variety of societies has revealed that both women and men typically contribute to primary food-getting activitiesâ€”but men usually contribute more in terms of calories.<sup>19</sup> Women are almost always occupied with infant- and child-care responsibilities in most societies, so it is not surprising that men usually do most of the pri-

mary food-getting work, which generally has to be done away from the home.

In some societies women contribute more (in the caloric sense) to primary subsistence activities than do men. In societies that depend on hunting, fishing, and herdingâ€”generally male activitiesâ€”for most of their calories, men usually contribute more than women.<sup>20</sup> For example, among the Inuit, who traditionally depended mostly on hunting and fishing, and among the Toda, who depended mostly on herding, men did most of the primary subsistence work. But the predominant type of food-getting is not always predictive: among the Tchambuli, who depended mostly on fishing, women did most of the work. In societies that depend on gathering-primarily women's workâ€”women tend to do most of the food-getting (in terms of calories). The !Kung are an example. But most societies known to anthropology depend primarily on agriculture, not on hunting or gathering, for their calories. And, with the exception of clearing land and preparing the soil, which are usually men's tasks, the work of planting, crop tending (weeding, irrigating), and harvesting crops is done by men *or* women or both (see Table  $9-1$ ). So we need some explanation of why women do most of the agriculture in some societies and men in others. Different patterns predominate in different areas of the world. In Africa south of the Sahara, women generally do most of the agriculture. But in much of Asia

and in Europe and the areas around the Mediterranean, men do more.<sup>21</sup>

One apparently explanatory factor is the kind of agriculture done. Many writers have pointed out that with intensive agriculture, particularly plow agriculture, men's caloric contribution to primary subsistence tends to be much higher than women's. In horticultural societies, in contrast, women's contribution is relatively high compared with men's. Figure  $9-1$  shows the relationship between women's relative contribution to primary subsistence and the type of cultivation practiced. As the graph indicates, women contribute the most when horticulture is practicedâ€”either root and tree crop horticulture (labeled Horticulture) or shifting/slash-and-burn cultivation (labeled Extensive or Shifting Agriculture). According to Ester Boserup, when population increases and there is pressure to make more intensive use of the land, cultivators begin to use the plow and irrigation, and males start to do more.<sup>22</sup> But it is not quite clear why.

Why should women not continue to contribute a lot to agriculture just because plows are used? In trying to answer this question, most researchers shift to considering how much time males and females spend in various agricultural tasks, rather than estimating the total caloric contribution of females versus males. The reason for this shift is that gender contribution to agriculture varies sub-

#### FIGURE 9â€“1 Relationship between Type and Intensity of Agriculture and Average Percentage of Women's Contribution to Subsistence

stantially over the various phases of the production sequence, as well as from one crop to another. Thus, the total amount of time females versus males work at agricultural tasks is easier to estimate than how much each gender contributes to the diet in terms of calories. How would caloric contribution be judged, for example, if men do the clearing and plowing, women do the planting and weeding, and both do the harvesting?

One suggestion about why males contribute more to agriculture when the plow is used is that plow agriculture involves a great deal of labor input in the clearing and preparation phases of cultivation, and at the same time minimizes subsequent weeding time. Men usually clear land anyway, but clearing is a more time-consuming process if intensive agriculture is practiced. It has been estimated that in one district in Nigeria, 100 days of work are required to clear one acre of virgin land for plowing by tractor; only 20 days are required to prepare the land for shifting cultivation. Weeding is a task that probably can be combined with child care, and perhaps for that reason it may have been performed mostly by women previously.<sup>23</sup> But the fact that men do the plowing, which may take a lot of time, does not explain why women do relatively less of all agricultural tasks, including weeding, in societies that have the plow.<sup>24</sup>

Another explanation for why women contribute less time than men to intensive agriculture is that household chores increase with intensive agriculture and thus limit the time women can spend in the fields. Intensive agriculturalists typically rely heavily on grain crops, which take much more work to make edible. Cereal grains (corn, wheat, oats) are usually dried before storing. They therefore take a long time to cook if they are left whole. More cooking requires more time to collect water and firewood (usually women's work) and more time to clean pots and utensils. A variety of techniques can reduce cooking time (such as soaking, grinding, or pounding), but the process that speeds up cooking the mostâ€”grindingâ€”is itself time-consuming (unless done by machine). Finally, household work may increase substantially with intensive agriculture because women in such societies have more children than women in horticultural societies. If household work increases in these ways, it is easy to understand why women cannot contribute more time than men, or as much time as men, to intensive agriculture. But women's contributionâ€”although less than men's-is nonetheless quite substantial: they seem to work outside the home four and a half hours a day, seven days a week, on the average.<sup>25</sup>

We still have not explained why women contribute so much to horticulture in the first place. They may not have as much household work as intensive-agricultural women, but neither do the men. Why, then, don't men do relatively more in horticulture also? One possibility is that in horticultural societies men are often drawn away from cultivation into other types of activities. There is evidence that if males are engaged in warfare when primary subsistence work has to be done, then the women must take care of that work.<sup>26</sup> Men may also be withdrawn from primary subsistence work if they have to work in distant towns and cities for wages or if they periodically go on long-distance trading trips.<sup>27</sup>

When women contribute a lot to primary food-getting activities we might expect their behavior and attitudes concerning children to be affected. Several cross-cultural studies suggest that this expectation is correct. In societies with a high female contribution to primary subsistence (in terms of contributing calories), infants are fed solid foods earlier (so that other persons besides mothers can feed them) than in societies with a low female contribution.<sup>28</sup> Girls are likely to be trained to be industrious (probably to help their mothers out), and girl babies are more valued.<sup>29</sup>

It is important to realize that what we conclude about gender contribution to subsistence depends largely on how we measure it. Most of our discussion until now has focused on contribution to primary subsistence activities. If we change our perspective for a moment and count all kinds of work, we see a different picture of men's versus women's contribution to making a living. Adding up all work time, including activities outside the home (mostly food-getting activities) and activities inside the home (mostly preparing and cooking food), women typically work more total hours per day than men in both intensive agricultural and horticultural societies.<sup>30</sup>

Political Leadership and Warfare. In almost every society we know about, men rather than women are the leaders in the political arena. One cross-cultural survey found that, in about 85 percent of the surveyed societies, only men were leaders. In the societies in which some women occupied leadership positions, the women were either outnumbered by or less powerful than the men leaders.<sup>31</sup> Whether or not we consider warfare to be part of the political sphere of life (see the chapter on political life), we find an almost universal dominance of males in that arena. In 87-88 percent of the world's societies, women never participate actively in war.<sup>32</sup> (See the box titled "Why Do Some Societies Allow Women to Participate in Combat?" for a discussion of women in combat in the remaining 12-13 percent of societies.)

Even in *matrilineal* societies, which seem to be oriented around women (see the chapter on marital residence and kinship), men usually occupy political positions. For example, among the Iroquois of what is now New York State, women had control over resources and a great deal of influence. But men, not women, held political office. The highest political body among the League of the Iroquois (which comprised five tribal groups) was a council of fifty male chiefs. Although women could not serve on the council, they could nominate, elect, and impeach their male representatives. Women also could decide between life and death for prisoners of war, they could forbid the men of their households to go to war, and they could intervene to bring about peace.<sup>33</sup>

Why have men (at least so far) almost always dominated the political sphere of life? Some scholars have suggested that men's role in warfare gives them the edge in all kinds of political leadership, particularly because they control weaponsâ€”an important resource.<sup>34</sup> But evidence suggests that force is rarely used to obtain leadership positions<sup>35</sup>; superior strength is not the deciding factor. Still, warfare may be related to political leadership for another reason. Warfare clearly affects survival, and it occurs regularly in most of the societies we know about. Therefore, decision making about war may be among the most important kinds of politics in most societies. If it is, then the persons who know the most about warfare should be making the decisions about it.

To explain why males and not females usually engage in fighting, let us refer to three of the possible explanations of the worldwide patterns in the gender division of labor. Warfare, like hunting, probably requires strength (for throwing weapons)

#### WHY DO SOME SOCIETIES ALLOW WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN COMBAT?

U.S. women can serve in the military but usually are excluded from combat. Some women feel that such exclusion is unfair and decreases their chances of promotion in the military. Other people (including some women) insist that female participation in combat would be detrimental to military performance or is inappropriate for women.

Why then do some societies allow women to be warriors? Psychologist David Adams compared about 70 societies studied by anthropologists to try to answer that question. Although most societies exclude women from war, Adams found that women are active warriors, at least occasionally, in 13 percent of the sample societies. In native North America, such societies included the Comanche, Crow, Delaware, Fox, Gros Ventre, and Navaho. In the Pacific, there were active warrior women among the Maori of New Zealand, on Majuro in the Marshall Islands, and among the Orokaiva of New Guinea. In none of these societies were the warriors usually women, but women were allowed to engage in combat if they wanted to.

New Perspectives on Gender

How are the societies with women warriors different from those that exclude women from combat? They differ in one of two ways. Either they conduct war only against people in other societies (this is called "purely external" war) or they marry within their own community. Adams argues that these two conditions, which are not particularly common, preclude the possibility of conflicts of interest between wives and husbands, and therefore women can be permitted to engage in combat because their interests are the same as their husbands'. Because marriages in most cases involve individuals from the same society, husbands and wives will have the same loyalities if the society has

and quick bursts of energy (for running). And certainly combat is one of the most dangerous and uninterruptible activities imaginable, hardly compatible with child care. Also, even if they do not at the moment have children, women may generally be kept out of combat because their potential fertility is more important to a population's reproduction and survival than their potential usefulness as warriors.<sup>36</sup> So, the strength theory, the compatibility theory, and the expendability theory might all explain the predominance of men in warfare.

Two other factors may be involved in male predominance in politics. One is the generally greater height of men. Why height should be a factor in leadership is unclear, but studies suggest that taller persons are more likely to be leaders.<sup>37</sup> Finally, there is the possibility that men dominate politics because they get around more in the outside world than do women. Men's activities typically take them farther from home; women tend to work more around the home. If societies choose leaders at least in part because of what they know about the larger world, then men will generally have some advantage. In support of this reasoning, Patricia Draper found that in !Kung bands that had settled down women no longer engaged in long-distance gathering, and they lost much of their former influence in making decisions.<sup>38</sup> Involvement in child care may also detract from such influence. In a study of village leadership among the Kayapo of Brazil, Dennis Werner found that women with heavy child-care burdens were less influential than women not as involved in child care; perhaps they had fewer friends and missed many details of what was going on in the village.<sup>39</sup>

These various explanations suggest why men generally dominate politics, but we still need to explain why women participate in politics more in some societies than in others. Marc Ross investigated this question in a cross-cultural survey of ninety societies.<sup>40</sup> In that sample, the degree of fe-

purely external war. And even if war occurs between communities and larger groups in the same society (what we call "internal" war), there will be no conflict of interest between husband and wife if they both grew up in the same community. In contrast, there is internal war at least occasionally in most societies, and wives usually marry in from other communities. In this situation, there may often be a conflict of interest between husband and wife; if women were to engage in combat, they might have to fight against their fathers, paternal uncles, and brothers. And wouldn't we expect the wives to try to warn kin in their home communities if the husbands planned to attack them? Indeed,

the men's likely fear of their wives' disloyalty would explain why women in these societies are forbidden to make or handle weapons or go near meetings in which war plans are discussed.

Many countries today engage in purely external war, so other things being equal, we would not expect conflicts of interest to impede women's participation in combat. Therefore, extrapolating from Adams's findings, we might expect that the barriers against female participation in combat will disappear completely. But other conditions may have to be present before women and men participate equally in combat. In Adams's study, not all societies with purely external war or intracommunity marriage had women warriors. So we may also have to consider the degree to which the society seeks to maximize reproduction (and therefore protect women from danger) and the degree to which the society depends on women for subsistence during wartime.

There are other related questions to explore. Does military participation by women increase women's participation in politics? Does the presence of war in a society decrease or increase women's political participation? Does women's participation in politics or in the military change the nature of war?

male participation in politics varied considerably. For example, among the Mende of Sierra Leone women regularly held high office, but among the Azande of Zaire women took no part in public life. One factor that appeared to predict the exclusion of women from politics was the organization of communities around male kin. As we will see later, women when they marry usually have to leave their communities and move to their husband's place. If women are "strangers" in a community with many related males, then the males will have political advantages because of their knowledge of community members and past events.

The Relative Status of Women. There are probably as many definitions of status as there are researchers interested in the topic. To some, the relative status of the sexes means how much importance society confers on females versus males. To others, it means how much power and authority men and women have relative to each other. And to still others, it means what kinds of rights women and men possess to do what they want to do. In any case, many social scientists are asking why the status of women appears to vary from one society to another. Why do women have few rights and little influence in some societies and more of each in other societies? Or, in other words, why is there variation in degree of gender stratification?

In the small Iraqi town of Daghara, women and men live very separate lives.<sup>41</sup> In many respects, women appear to have very little status. Like women in much of the Islamic world, women in Daghara live their lives mostly in seclusion: they stay in their houses and interior courtyards. If women must go out, which they can do only with male approval, they must shroud their faces and bodies in long, black cloaks. These cloaks must be worn in mixed company, even at home. Women are essentially excluded from political activities. Legally, they are considered to be under the authority of their fathers and husbands. Even the sexuality of women is controlled. There is strict emphasis on virginity before marriage. Because women are not permitted even casual conversations with strange men, the possibilities for extramarital or even premarital relationships are very slight. In contrast, hardly any sexual restrictions are imposed on men.

But some societies, such as the Mbuti Pygmies, seem to approach equal status for males and females. Like most food collectors, the Mbuti have no formal political organization to make decisions or to settle disputes. Public disputes occur, and both

women and men take part in the uproar that is part of such disputes. Not only do women make their positions known, but their opinions are often heeded. Even in domestic quarrels involving physical violence between husband and wife, others usually intervene to stop them, regardless of who hit whom first.<sup>42</sup> Women control the use of dwellings; they usually have equal say over the disposal of resources they or the men collect, over the upbringing of their children, and about whom their children should marry. One of the few signs of inequality is that women are somewhat more restricted than men with respect to extramarital sex.<sup>43</sup>

There are many theories about why women have relatively high or low status. One of the most common is that women's status will be high when they contribute substantially to primary subsistence activities. According to this theory, then, women should have very little status when food-getting depends largely on hunting, herding, or intensive agriculture. A second theory suggests that where warfare is especially important, men will be more valued and esteemed than women. A third theory suggests that where there are centralized political hierarchies, men will have higher status. The reasoning in the last theory is essentially the same as

In some societies women are secluded in their houses and courtyards. This woman in South Yemen is obliged to wear a veil whenever she goes out.

that in the warfare theoryâ€”men usually play the dominant role in political behavior, so men's status should be higher wherever political behavior is more important or frequent. Finally, there is the theory that women will have higher status where kin groups and couples' place of residence after marriage are organized around women.

One of the problems in evaluating these theories is that decisions have to be made about the meaning of status. Does it mean value? Rights? Influence? And do all these aspects of status vary together? Cross-cultural research by Martin Whyte suggests that they do not. For each sample society in his study, Whyte rated fifty-two items that might be used to define the relative status of the sexes. These items included things such as which sex can inherit property, who has final authority over disciplining unmarried children, and whether the gods in the society are male, female, or both. The results of the study indicate that very few of these items are related. Therefore, Whyte concluded, we cannot talk about status as a single concept. Rather, it seems more appropriate to talk about the relative status of women in different spheres of life.<sup>44</sup>

Even though Whyte found no necessary connection between one aspect of status and another, he decided to ask whether some of the theories just mentioned correctly predict why some societies have many (as opposed to few) areas in which the status of women is high. Let us turn first to the ideas that are not supported by the available crosscultural evidence. The idea that generally high status derives from a greater caloric contribution to primary subsistence activities is not supported at all.<sup>45</sup> Women in intensive-agricultural societies (who contribute less than men to primary subsistence) do tend to have lower status in many areas of life, just as in the Iraqi case described above. But in societies that depend mostly on hunting (where women also do little of the primary subsistence work), women seem to have higher statusâ€”which contradicts the theoretical expectation. Similarly, there is no consistent evidence that a high frequency of warfare generally lowers women's status in different spheres of life.<sup>46</sup>

What does predict higher status for women in many areas of life? Although the results are not that strong, there is some support in Whyte's study for the theory that where kin groups and marital residence are organized around women, women have somewhat higher status (we discuss these features of society more fully in the chapter on marital residence and kinship). The Iroquois are a good example. Even though Iroquois women could not hold political office, they had considerable authority within and beyond the household. Related women lived together in longhouses with husbands who belonged to other kin groups. In the longhouse, the women's authority was clear and they could ask objectionable men to leave. The women controlled the allocation of the food they produced. Allocation could influence the timing of war parties, since men could not undertake a raid without provisions. Women were involved in the selection of religious leaders, half of whom were women. Even in politics, although women could not speak or serve on the council, they largely controlled the selection of councilmen and could institute impeachment proceedings against those to whom they objected.47

A generally lower status for women does appear to be found in societies with political hierarchies.<sup>48</sup> Lower status for women appears to be associated with other indicators of cultural complexity as well as with political hierarchies. Societies with social stratification, plow and irrigation agriculture, large settlements, private property, and craft specialization tend to have lower status for women. (One type of influence for women increases with cultural complexity-informal influence. But as Whyte pointed out, informal influence may simply reflect a lack of real influence.<sup>49</sup>) Why cultural complexity is associated with women having less authority in the home, less control over property, and more restricted sexual lives is not yet understood.

Western colonialism also appears to have been generally detrimental to women's status, perhaps because Westerners have been accustomed to dealing with men. There are plenty of examples of Europeans restructuring land ownership around men and teaching men modern farming techniques, even in places where women were usually the farmers. In addition, men more often than women could earn cash through wage labor or through sales of goods (such as furs) to Europeans.<sup>50</sup> Although the relative status of men and women may not have been equal before the Europeans arrived, colonial influences seem generally to have undermined the position of women.

We are beginning to understand some of the conditions that may enhance or decrease certain aspects of women's status. If we can understand which of these conditions are most important, society may (if it wants to) be able to reduce gender inequality.<sup>51</sup>

#### Personality

Reporting on three tribes in New Guinea, Margaret Mead said that "many, if not all, of the personality traits we have called masculine or feminine are as lightly linked to sex as are the clothing, the manners, and the form of head-dress that a society at a given period assigns to either sex."52 In other words, she suggested that there were no universal or nearuniversal personality differences between the sexes. Rather, societies were free to create any such differences. She described Arapesh females and males as essentially alike: both sexes were gentle, cooperative, and nurturing. She also described the Mundugumor males and females as similar, but in this case both sexes exhibited violence and aggression. Finally, she described the Tchambuli as having substantial female-male differences in temperament, but oppo-

*When a society has very different role expectations for boys* and girls, it is difficult to know how much of the sex difference in aggression is due to biology and how much is due to learning.

site to what we might expect. The women were domineering, practical, and impersonal and were the chief economic providers; the men were sensitive and delicate and devoted their time to their appearance and to artistic pursuits.

But research conducted in recent years does not support Mead's view that there are no consistent sex differences in temperament. On the contrary, some sex differences in behavior occur consistently and in quite diverse societies. (This does not mean that Mead was wrong about the three New Guinea societies she studiedâ€”it is possible that they were unusual cases. Nancy McDowell reanalyzed Mead's Mundugumor notes and studied a group of related neighboring people; she found no reason to doubt Mead's conclusion that female and male temperaments were similar.<sup>53</sup>) It is also possible that Mead might have found some gender differences if she had employed the kinds of observation techniques (particularly systematic and randomized behavior observations) that have been employed in recent field studies. Such studies systematically record the minute details of behavior of a substantial number of males and females. Any conclusions about femalemale differences in aggressiveness, for example, are based on actual counts of the number of times a particular individual tried to hurt or injure another person in a fixed amount of observation time.

Which differences in personality are suggested by these more systematic studies? Most of them have observed children in different cultural settings. The most consistent difference is in the area of aggression: boys try to hurt others more frequently than girls do. In an extensive comparative study of children's behavior-the Six Cultures projectâ€”this difference showed up as early as three to six years of age.<sup>54</sup> Research done in the United States is consistent with the cross-cultural findings.<sup>55</sup> In a large number of observational and experimental studies, boys exhibited more aggression than girls.

Other female-male differences have turned up with considerable consistency, but we have to be more cautious in accepting them, either because they have not been documented as well or because there are more exceptions. There seems to be a tendency for girls to exhibit more responsible behavior, including nurturance (trying to help others). Girls seem more likely to conform to adult wishes and commands. Boys try more often to exert dominance over others in order to get their own way. In play, boys and girls show a preference for their own gender. Boys seem to play in large groups, girls in small ones. And boys seem to maintain more distance between each other than girls do.<sup>56</sup>

If we assume that these differences are consistent across cultures, how can we explain them? Many writers and researchers believe that because certain female-male differences are so consistent, they are probably rooted in the biological differences between the two sexes. Aggression is one of the traits talked about most often in this connection, particularly because this male-female difference appears so early in life.<sup>57</sup> But an alternative argument is that societies bring up boys and girls differently because they almost universally require adult males and females to perform different types of roles. If most societies expect adult males to be warriors or to be prepared to be warriors, shouldn't we expect most societies to encourage or idealize aggression in males? And if females are almost always the caretakers of infants, shouldn't we also expect societies generally to encourage nurturant behaviors in females?

Researchers tend to adopt either the biological or the socialization view, but it is quite possible that both kinds of causes are important in the development of gender differences. For example, parents might turn a slight genetic difference into a large gender difference by maximizing that difference in the way they socialize boys versus girls.

It is difficult for researchers to distinguish the influence of genes (or other biological conditions) from the influence of socialization. We do have research indicating that as early as birth parents treat boy and girl infants differently.<sup>58</sup> In spite of the fact that objective observers can see no major "personality" differences between girl and boy infants, parents often claim to.<sup>59</sup> But parents may unconsciously want to see differences and may therefore produce them in socialization. So even early differences could be learned rather than genetic. Remember too that researchers cannot do experiments with peopleâ€”for example, parents' behavior cannot be manipulated to find out what would happen if boys and girls were treated in exactly the same way.

However, there is considerable experimental research on aggression in nonhuman animals. These experiments suggest that the male hormone androgen is partly responsible for higher levels of aggression. For example, in some experiments, females injected with androgen at around the time the sexual organs develop (before or shortly after birth) behave more aggressively when they are older than do females without the hormone. These results may or may not apply to humans of course, but some researchers have investigated human females who were "androgenized" in the womb because of drugs given to their mothers to prevent miscarriages. By and large the results of these studies are similar to

the experimental studiesâ€”androgenized human females show similar patterns of higher aggression.<sup>60</sup> Some scholars take these results to indicate that biological differences between males and females are responsible for the male-female difference in aggression<sup>61</sup>; others suggest that even these results are not conclusive, because females who get more androgen show generally disturbed metabolic systems, and general metabolic disturbance may itself increase aggressiveness. Furthermore, androgeninjected females look more like males because they develop male genitals; therefore, they may be treated like males.<sup>62</sup>

Is there any evidence that socialization differences may account for differences in aggression? Although a cross-cultural survey of ethnographers' reports on 101 societies does show that more societies encourage aggression in boys than in girls, most societies show no difference in aggression training.<sup>63</sup> The few societies that show differences in aggression training can hardly account for the widespread sex differences in actual aggressiveness. But the survey does not necessarily mean that there are no consistent differences in aggression training for boys and girls. All it shows is that there are no obvious differences. For all we know, the learning of aggression and other "masculine" traits by boys could be produced by subtle types of socialization.

One possible type of subtle socialization that could create gender differences in behavior is the type of chores children are assigned. It is possible that little boys and girls learn to behave differently because their parents ask them to do different kinds of work. Beatrice and John Whiting reported from the Six Cultures project that in societies where children were asked to do a great deal of work, they generally showed more responsible and nurturant behavior. Because girls are almost always asked to do more work than boys, they may be more responsible and nurturant for that reason alone.<sup>64</sup> If this reasoning is correct, we should find that if boys are asked to do girls' work, they will learn to behave more like girls.

A study of Luo children in Kenya supports that view.<sup>65</sup> Girls were usually asked to babysit, cook, clean house, and fetch water and firewood. Boys were usually asked to do very little because boys' traditional work was herding cattle-and most families in the community studied had few cattle. But for some reason more boys than girls had been born, and many mothers without girls at home asked their sons to do girls' chores. Systematic behavior observations showed that much of the behavior of the boys who did girls' work was intermediary between the behavior of other boys and the behavior of girls. The boys who did girls' work were more like girls in that they were less aggressive, less domineering, and more responsible than other boys, even when they weren't working. So it is possible that task assignment has an important influence on how boys and girls learn to behave. These and other subtle forms of socialization need to be investigated more thoroughly; research may help us to understand better the origins of female-male differences in behavior.

Misconceptions about Differences in Behavior. Before we leave the subject of behavior differences, we should note some widespread beliefs about them that are unsupported. Some of these mistaken beliefs are that girls are more dependent than boys, that girls are more sociable, and that girls are more passive. The results obtained by the Six Cultures project cast doubt on all those notions.<sup>66</sup> First, if we think of dependency as seeking help and emotional support from others, girls are generally no more likely to behave this way than boys. To be sure, the results do indicate that boys and girls have somewhat different styles of dependency. Girls more often seek help and contact; boys more often seek attention and approval. As for sociability, which means seeking and offering friendship, the Six Cultures results showed no reliable differences between the sexes. Of course, boys and girls may be sociable in different ways because boys generally play in larger groups than girls. As for the supposed passivity of girls, the evidence is also not particularly convincing. Girls in the Six Cultures project did not consistently withdraw from aggressive attacks or comply with unreasonable demands. The only thing that emerged as a female-male difference was that older girls were less likely than boys to respond to aggression with aggression. But this finding may not reflect passivity as much as the fact that girls are less aggressive than boysâ€”which we already knew.

So some of our common ideas about femalemale differences are unfounded. Others, such as those dealing with aggression and responsibility, cannot be readily dismissed and should be investigated further.

#### SEXUALITY

In view of the way the human species reproduces, it is not surprising that sexuality is part of our nature. But no society we know of leaves sexuality to na-

Societies vary markedly in their rules about modesty. But these cultural rules change over time. In the past, both women and men in the United States were expected to cover much of their bodies on the beach.

ture; all have at least some rules governing "proper" conduct. There is much variation from one society to another in the degree of sexual activity permitted or encouraged before marriage, outside marriage, and even within marriage. And societies vary markedly in their tolerance of nonheterosexual sexuality.

#### Cultural Regulation of Sexuality: Permissiveness versus Restrictiveness

All societies seek to regulate sexual activity to some degree, and there is a lot of variation crossculturally. Some societies allow premarital sex, others forbid it. The same is true for extramarital sex. In addition, a society's degree of restrictiveness is not always consistent through the life span or for all aspects of sex. For example, quite a number of societies ease sexual restrictions somewhat for adolescents, and many become more restrictive for adults.<sup>67</sup> Then, too, societies change over time. Our own society has traditionally been rather restrictive, but until recently (before the emergence of the AIDS epidemic) more permissive attitudes were gaining acceptance.

Premarital Sex. The degree to which sex before marriage is approved or disapproved of varies greatly from society to society. The Trobriand Islanders, for example, approved of and encouraged premarital sex, seeing it as an important preparation for later marriage roles. Both girls and boys were given complete instruction in all forms of sexual expression at the onset of puberty and were allowed plenty of opportunity for intimacy. Some societies not only allow premarital sex on a casual basis, but specifically encourage trial marriages between adolescents. Among the Ila-speaking peoples of central Africa, at harvest time girls were given houses of their own where they could play at being wife with the boys of their choice. It is said that among these people virginity did not exist beyond the age of ten.<sup>68</sup>

On the other hand, in many societies premarital sex was discouraged. For example, among the Tepoztlan Indians of Mexico, a girl's life became "crabbed, cribbed, confined" from the time of her first menstruation. A girl was not to speak to or encourage boys in the least way. To do so would be to court disgrace, to show herself to be crazy. The responsibility of guarding the chastity and reputation of one or more daughters of marriageable age was often felt to be a burden by the mother. One mother said she wished her fifteen-year-old daughter would marry soon because it was inconvenient to "spy" on her all the time.<sup>69</sup>

In many Muslim societies, a girl's premarital chastity was tested after her marriage. After the wedding night, blood-stained sheets were displayed as proof of the bride's virginity.

Extramarital Sex. Extramarital sex is not uncommon in many societies. In about 69 percent of the world's societies men have extramarital sex more than occasionally, and in about 57 percent so do women. The frequency of such sexual activity is higher than we might expect, given that only a slight majority of societies (54 percent) say they allow extramarital sex for men, and only a small number (11 percent) say they allow it for women.<sup>70</sup>

In several societies, then, there is quite a difference between the restrictive code and actual practice. The Navaho of the 1940s were said to forbid adultery, but young married men under thirty had 27 percent of their heterosexual contacts with women other than their wives.<sup>71</sup> And, although people in the United States in the 1970s almost overwhelmingly rejected extramarital sex, 41 percent of married men and about 18 percent of married women had had extramarital sex. (Proportionately more men and women in the 1990s reported that they had been faithful to their spouses.) $^{72}$  Cross-culturally, most societies have a double standard with regard to men and women: restrictions are considerably greater for women.<sup>73</sup> A substantial number of societies openly accept extramarital relationships. The Chukchee of Siberia, who often traveled long distances, allowed a married man to engage in sex with his host's wife, with the understanding that he would offer the same hospitality when the host visited him.74

Sex within Marriage. There is as much variety in the way coitus is performed as there is in sexual attitudes in general. Privacy is a nearly universal requirement. But, whereas a North American will usually find this in the bedroom, many other peoples are obliged to go out into the bush. The Siriono of Bolivia, for example, had as many as fifty hammocks 10 feet apart in their small huts.<sup>75</sup> In some cultures coitus often occurs in the presence of others, who may be sleeping or simply looking the other way.

Time and frequency of coitus are also variable. Night is generally preferred, but some peoples, such as the Rucuyen of Brazil and the Yapese of the Pacific Caroline Islands, specifically opted for day. The Chenchu of India believed that a child conceived at night might be born blind. People in most societies abstain from intercourse during menstruation, during at least part of pregnancy, and for a period after childbirth. The Lesu, a people of New Ireland, an island off New Guinea, prohibited all members of the community from engaging in sex between the death of any member and burial.<sup>76</sup> Some societies prohibit sexual relations before various activities, such as hunting, fighting, planting, brewing, and iron smelting. Our own society is among the most lenient regarding restrictions on coitus within marriage, imposing only rather loose restraints during mourning, menstruation, and pregnancy.

Homosexuality. The range in permissiveness or restrictiveness toward homosexual relations is as great as that for any other kind of sexual activity. Among the Lepcha of the Himalayas, a man was believed to become homosexual if he ate the flesh of an uncastrated pig. But the Lepcha said that homosexual behavior was practically unheard of, and they viewed it with disgust.<sup>77</sup> Perhaps because many societies deny that homosexuality exists, little is known about homosexual practices in the restrictive societies. Among the permissive ones, there is variation in the pervasiveness of homosexuality. In some societies homosexuality is accepted but limited to certain times and certain individuals. For example, among the Papago of the southwestern United States there were "nights of saturnalia," in which homosexual tendencies could be expressed. The Papago also had many male transvestites, who wore women's clothing, did women's chores, and, if not married, could be visited by men.<sup>78</sup> A woman did not have quite the same freedom of expression. She could participate in the saturnalia feasts only with her husband's permission, and female transvestites were nonexistent.

Homosexuality occurs even more widely in other societies. The Siwans of North Africa expected all males to engage in homosexual relations. In fact, fathers made arrangements for their unmarried sons to be given to an older man in a homosexual arrangement. Siwan custom limited a man to one boy. Fear of the government made this a secret matter, but before 1909 such arrangements were made openly. Almost all men were reported to have engaged in a homosexual relationship as boys; later, when they were between sixteen and twenty, they married girls.<sup>79</sup> Among the most extremely prohomosexual societies, the Etoro of New Guinea preferred homosexuality to heterosexuality. Heterosexuality was prohibited as many as 260 days a year and was forbidden in or near the house and gardens. Male homosexuality, on the other hand, was not prohibited at any time and was believed to make crops flourish and boys become strong.<sup>80</sup>

#### Reasons for Restrictiveness

Before we deal with the question of why some societies are more restrictive than others, we must first ask whether all forms of restrictiveness go together. The research to date suggests that societies that are restrictive with regard to one aspect of heterosexual sex tend to be restrictive with regard to other aspects. Thus, societies that frown on sexual expression by young children also punish premarital and extramarital sex.<sup>81</sup> Furthermore, such societies tend to insist on modesty in clothing and are constrained in their talk about sex.<sup>82</sup> But societies that are generally restrictive about heterosexuality are not necessarily restrictive about homosexuality. Societies restrictive about premarital sex are neither more nor less likely to restrict homosexuality. In the case of extramarital sex, the situation is somewhat different. Societies that have a considerable amount of male homosexuality tend to disapprove of males having extramarital heterosexual relationships.<sup>83</sup> If we are going to explain restrictiveness, then, it appears we have to consider heterosexual and homosexual restrictiveness separately.

Let us consider homosexual restrictiveness first. The ethnographic material indicates an extremely broad range of societal reactions to homosexual relationships. Why? Why do homosexual relationships occur more frequently in some societies, and why are some societies intolerant of such relationships? There are many psychological interpretations of why some people become interested in homosexual relationships, and many of these interpretations relate the phenomenon to early parent-child relationships. So far the research has not yielded any clear-cut predictions, although several cross-cultural predictors about male homosexuality are intriguing.

One such finding is that societies that forbid abortion and infanticide for married women (most societies permit these practices for illegitimate births) are likely to be intolerant of male homosexuality. This and other findings are consistent with the point of view that homosexuality is less tolerated in societies that would like to increase population. Such societies may be intolerant of all kinds of behaviors that minimize population growth. Homosexuality would have this effect, if we assume that a higher frequency of homosexual relations is associated with a lower frequency of heterosexual relations. The less frequently heterosexual relations occur, the lower the number of conceptions there might be. Another indication that intolerance may be related to a desire for population growth is that societies with famines and severe food shortages are more likely to allow homosexuality. Famines and food shortages suggest population pressure on resources; under these conditions homosexuality and other practices that minimize population growth may be tolerated or even encouraged.<sup>84</sup>

The history of the Soviet Union may provide some other relevant evidence. In 1917, in the turmoil of revolution, laws prohibiting abortion and homosexuality were revoked and reproduction was discouraged. But in the period 1934-1936 the policy was reversed. Abortion and homosexuality were again declared illegal, and homosexuals were arrested. At the same time, awards were given to mothers who had more children.<sup>85</sup> Population pressure may also explain why our own society has become somewhat more tolerant of homosexuality recently. Of course, population pressure does not explain why certain individuals become homosexual or why most individuals in some societies engage in such behavior, but it might explain why some societies view such behavior more or less permissively.

Let us turn now to heterosexual behavior. What kinds of societies are more permissive than others? Although we do not as yet understand the reasons, we do know that greater restrictiveness toward premarital sex tends to occur in more complex societiesâ€”societies that have hierarchies of political officials, part-time or full-time craft specialists, cities and towns, and class stratification.<sup>86</sup> It may be that as social inequality increases and various groups come to have differential wealth, parents become more concerned with preventing their children from marrying "beneath them." Permissiveness toward premarital sexual relationships might lead a person to become attached to someone who would not be considered a desirable marriage partner. Even worse (from the family's point of view), such "unsuitable" sexual liaisons might result in a pregnancy that could make it impossible for a girl to marry "well." Controlling mating, then, may be a way of trying to control property. Consistent with this view is the finding that virginity is emphasized in rank and stratified societies, in which families are

likely to exchange goods and money in the course of arranging marriages.<sup>87</sup>

As is apparent from our review in this chapter, the biological fact that humans depend on sexual reproduction does not by itself help us explain why females and males differ in so many ways across cultures, or why societies vary in the way they handle male and female roles. We are only beginning to investigate these questions. When we eventually understand more about how and why females and males are different or the same in roles, personality, and sexuality, we may be better able to decide how much we want the biology of sex to shape our lives.

### V SUMMARY

1. That humans reproduce sexually does not explain why males and females tend to differ in appearance and behavior, and to be treated differently, in all societies.

2. All or nearly all societies assign certain activities to females and other activities to males. These worldwide gender patterns of division of labor may be explained by male-female differences in strength, by differences in compatibility of tasks with child care, or by economy-of-effort considerations, and/or the expendability of men.

3. Perhaps because women almost always have infant- and child-care responsibilities, men in most societies contribute more to primary subsistence activities (in terms of calories). But women contribute substantially to primary subsistence activities in societies that depend heavily on gathering and horticulture and in which warfare occurs while primary subsistence work has to be done. When primary and secondary subsistence work are counted, women typically work more hours than men. In most societies men are the leaders in the political arena, and warfare is almost exclusively a male activity.

The relative status of women (compared 4. with that of men) seems to vary from one area of life to another: whether women have relatively high status in one area does not necessarily indicate that they

will have high status in another. Less complex societies, however, seem to approach more equal status for males and females in a variety of areas of life.

5. Recent field studies have suggested some consistent female-male differences in personality: boys tend to be more aggressive than girls, and girls seem to be more responsible and helpful than boys.

6. Although all societies regulate sexual activity to some extent, societies vary considerably in the degree to which various kinds of sexuality are permitted. Some societies allow both masturbation and sex play among children, whereas others forbid such acts. Some societies allow premarital sex; others do not. Some allow extramarital sex in certain situations; others forbid it generally.

7. Societies that are restrictive toward one aspect of heterosexual sex tend to be restrictive with regard to other aspects. And more complex societies tend to be more restrictive toward premarital heterosexual sex than less complex societies.

Societal attitudes toward homosexuality 8. are not completely consistent with attitudes toward sexual relationships between the sexes. Societal tolerance of homosexuality is associated with tolerance of abortion and infanticide and with famines and food shortages.
