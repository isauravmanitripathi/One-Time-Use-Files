# Marital Residence and Kinship

![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg)

In the United States and Canada, and in many other industrial societies, a young man and woman usually establish a place of residence apart from their parents or other relatives when they marry, if they have not already moved away before that. Our society is so oriented toward this pattern of marital residence-neolocal (new-place) residence-that it seems to be the obvious and natural one to follow. Some upper-income families begin earlier than others to train their children to live away from home by sending them to boarding schools at age thirteen or fourteen, or to sleep-away summer camps. Young adults of all income levels learn to live away from home most of the year, if they join the army or attend an out-of-town college. In any case, when a young person marries, he or she generally lives apart from family.

So familiar is neolocal residence to us that we tend to assume that all societies practice the same pattern. On the contrary, of the 565 societies in George Peter Murdock's World Ethnographic Sample, only about 5 percent followed this practice.1 About 95 percent of the world's societies have some pattern of residence whereby a new couple settles within, or very close to, the household of the parents or some other close relative of either the groom or the bride. When married couples live near kin, it stands to reason that kinship relationships will figure prominently in the social life of the society. Marital residence largely predicts the types of kin groups found in a society, as well as how people refer to and classify their various relatives.

As we will see, kin groups that include several or many families and hundreds or even thousands of people are found in many societies and structure many areas of social life. Kin groups may have important economic, social, political, and religious functions.

### PATTERNS OF MARITAL RESIDENCE

In societies in which newly married couples customarily live with or close to their kin, several residence patterns may be established. Children in all societies are required to marry outside the nuclear family (because of the incest taboo), and couples in almost all societies live together after they are married (with a few exceptions); therefore some children have to leave home when they marry. But which married children remain at home and which reside elsewhere? Societies vary in the way they deal with this question, but there are not many different patterns. Actually, only four occur with any sizable frequency (the percentages shown below do not sum to 100 because of rounding):

- 1. Patrilocal residence: The son stays and the daughter leaves so that the married couple lives with or near the husband's parents (67 percent of all societies).
- 2. Matrilocal residence: The daughter stays and the son leaves so that the married couple lives with or near the wife's parents (15 percent of all societies).
- 3. Bilocal residence: Either the son or the daughter leaves so that the married couple lives with or near either the wife's or the husband's parents (7 percent of all societies).
- 4. Avunculocal residence: Both son and daughter normally leave, but the son and his wife settle with or near his mother's brother (4 percent of all societies).<sup>2</sup>

In these definitions, we use the phrase "the married couple lives with or near" a particular set of in-laws. When couples live with or near the kin of a spouse, the couple may live in the same household with those kin, creating an extended-family household, or they may live separately in an *independent*family household, but nearby.

A fifth pattern of residence, of course, is neolocal, in which the newly married couple does not live with or near kin.

5. Neolocal residence: Both son and daughter leave; married couples live apart from the relatives of both spouses (5 percent of all societies).

Figure  $11-1$  graphically shows the percentage of societies in the ethnographic record that practice each of the five marital residence patterns.

How does place of residence affect the social life of the couple? Because the pattern of residence governs with whom or near whom individuals live, it largely determines which people those individuals interact with and have to depend on. If a married couple is surrounded by the kin of the husband, for example, the chances are that those relatives will figure importantly in the couple's future. Whether the couple lives with or near the husband's or the wife's kin can also be expected to have important consequences for the status of the husband or wife. If married couples live patrilocally, as occurs in most societies, the wife may be far from her own kin. In any case, she will be an outsider among

In most societies known to anthropology, the bride leaves her home to live with or near her husband's parents when she marries. A Korean bride was traditionally carried in a litter to the home of the groom.

a group of male relatives who have grown up together. The feeling of being an outsider is particularly strong when the wife has moved into a patrilocal extended-family household.

Among the Tiv of central Nigeria,<sup>3</sup> the patrilocal extended family consists of the "great father," who is the head of the household, and his younger brothers, his sons, and his younger brothers' sons. Also included are the in-marrying wives and all unmarried children. (The sisters and daughters of the household head who have married would have gone to live where their husbands lived.) Authority is strongly vested in the male line, particularly the eldest of the household, who has authority over bride price, disputes, punishment, and plans for new buildings.

A somewhat different situation exists if the husband comes to live with or near his wife's parents. In this case, the wife and her kin take on somewhat greater importance, and the husband is the outsider. As we shall see, however, the matrilocal situation is not quite the mirror image of the patrilocal, because in matrilocal societies the husband's kin often are not far away. Moreover, even though residence is matrilocal, women often do not have as much to say in decision making as their brothers do.

If the married couple does not live with or near the parents or close kin of either spouse, the situation is again quite different. It should not be surprising that relatives and kinship connections do not figure very largely in everyday life in neolocal residence situations.

# EXPLANATIONS OF VARIATION IN RESIDENCE

Questions can be raised as to why different societies have different patterns of residence. If in most societies married couples live with or near kin (as in patrilocal, matrilocal, bilocal, and avunculocal residence), then why in some societies, such as our own, do couples typically live apart from kin? And, among the societies in which couples live with or near kin, why do most choose the husband's side (patrilocal residence) but some the wife's side (matrilocal residence)? Why do some nonneolocal societies allow a married couple to go to either the wife's or the husband's kin (bilocal residence), whereas most others do not allow a choice? (Because matrilocal, patrilocal, and avunculocal residence specify just one pattern, they are often called nonoptional or **unilocal residence** patterns.)

#### Neolocal Residence

Many anthropologists have suggested that neolocal residence is somehow related to the presence of a money or commercial economy. They argue that when people can sell their labor or their products for money, they can buy what they need to live, without having to depend on kin. Because money is not perishable (unlike crops and other foods in a world largely lacking refrigeration), it can be stored for exchange at a later time. Thus, a money-earning family can resort to its own savings during periods of unemployment or disability (or it might be able to rely on monetary aid from the government, as in our own society). This strategy is impossible in nonmoney economies, where people must depend on relatives for food and other necessities if for some reason they cannot provide their own.

There is some cross-cultural evidence to support this interpretation. Neolocal residence tends to occur in societies with monetary or commercial exchange, whereas societies without money tend to have patterns of residence that locate a couple near or with kin.<sup>4</sup> The presence of money, then, appears to be related to neolocal residence: money seems to allow couples to live on their own. Still, this fact does not quite explain why they choose to do so.

One reason may be that in commercial societies couples do better on their own because the jobs available require physical or social mobility. Or perhaps couples prefer to live apart from kin because they want to avoid some of the interpersonal tensions and demands that may be generated by living with or near kin. But why couples, when given money, should *prefer* to live on their own is not yet completely understood.

#### Matrilocal versus Patrilocal Residence

Traditionally, it has been assumed that in societies in which married children live near or with kin, residence will tend to be patrilocal if males contribute more to the economy and matrilocal if women contribute more. However plausible that assumption may seem, the cross-cultural evidence does not support it. Where men do most of the primary subsistence work, residence is patrilocal no more often than would be expected by chance. Conversely, where women do an equal amount or more of the subsistence work, residence is no more likely to be matrilocal than patrilocal.<sup>5</sup> And if we counted all work in and outside the home, most societies should be matrilocal because women usually do more. But that is not true either-most societies are not matrilocal.

We can predict whether residence will be matrilocal or patrilocal, however, from the type of warfare practiced in a society. In most societies known to anthropology, neighboring communities or districts are enemies. The type of warfare that breaks out periodically between such groups is called internal, because the fighting occurs between groups that speak the same language. In other societies, the warfare is never within the same society but only with other language groups. This pattern of warfare is referred to as purely external. Cross-cultural evidence suggests that in societies where warfare is at least sometimes internal, residence is almost always patrilocal rather than matrilocal. In con-trast, residence is usually matrilocal when warfare is purely external.<sup>6</sup>

How can we explain this relationship between type of warfare and matrilocal versus patrilocal residence? One theory is that patrilocal residence tends to occur with internal warfare because there may be concern over keeping sons close to home to help with defense. Because women do not usually constitute the fighting force in any society, having sons reside at home after marriage might be favored as a means of maintaining a loyal and quickly mobilized

#### NEOLOCALITY AND ADOLESCENT REBELLION: ARE THEY RELATED?

In our society it is taken for granted that adolescence means turmoil and parent-child conflict. Teenagers, parents, and educators worry about how to reduce the conflict. But few in our society ask why the conflict occurs in the first place. Is it "natural" for adolescents to be rebellious? Are they rebellious in all cultures? If not, why do we have conflict in this society?

This issue was first raised by Margaret Mead. In her bestselling Coming of Age in Samoa (originally published in 1928), she said that conflict during adolescence was minimal in Samoa. Some researchers have recently criticized her analysis (see our discussion in the chapter on psychology and culture), but many field and comparative studies by anthropologists have since found that adolescence is not experienced in the same way in all societies. For example, in their systematic cross-cultural study of adolescence, Alice Schlegel and Herbert Barry concluded that relations between adolescents and their families were generally harmonious around

the world. They suggested that when family members need each other throughout their lives, independence (as expressed in adolescent rebelliousness) would be quite foolhardy. Indeed, Schlegel and Barry found that adolescents are likely to be rebellious only in societies (like our own) that have *neolocal* residence and considerable job and geographical mobility.

Why should this be? We might speculate that adolescent rebellion is an elaborate psychodrama played out by both parents and children to prepare themselves for moving apart. Children spend a considerable part of their lives being dependent on their parents. But they know they must move away, and that prospect may arouse anxiety. Children want to be independent, but independence is scary. Dependence is nice in some ways—at least it can make life easier (someone else cooks for you and so on)—but it is also less grown-up than independence. So what pushes a child to leave? Perhaps the conflict itself propels the departure. Teenagers

ask for things they want, but they may know (at least unconsciously) that their parents will say no. And parents often do say no, so the teenager gets angry and can't wait to be on her own. Parents are also ambivalent. They want their children to grow up, but they miss them when they leave. After a period of conflict, it may be a relief for all concerned when parents and children go their separate ways.

What if our social structure were different? What if parents and children knew that some of the children were going to spend the rest of their lives with or near the parents? And even those children who moved away (as some would have to in societies practicing matrilocal, patrilocal, avunculocal, or bilocal residence) would know they were going to spend the rest of their lives with or near their inlaws. Could teenagers in nonneolocal societies afford to have serious conflict with their parents? Could the parents afford to have serious conflict with the teenagers who will be staying put after their marriages? We think

Park # # # # # #

fighting force in case of surprise attack from nearby. If warfare is purely external, however, people may not be so concerned about keeping their sons at home because families need not fear attack from neighboring communities or districts.

With purely external warfare, then, residence

may be determined by other considerations, especially economic ones. If in societies with purely external warfare the women do most of the primary subsistence work, families might want their daughters to remain at home after marriage, so the pattern of residence might become matrilocal. not. We suggest that adolescent conflict would be very disadvantageous in a nonneolocal society, and therefore we would expect its minimization or suppression when the residence pattern is other than neolocal.

There is another reason why rebelliousness might be associated with neolocality; it has to do with the fact that neolocality is predicted by commercial exchange. In the modern world, commercial societies are likely to have a great deal of occupational specialization and people with many different values. Thus children are presented with a great many choices in a rapidly changing culture. Let us consider the effect of a rapidly changing technology. If children have to know and do things that the parents do not know about, how can we expect the children to want to follow in their parents' footsteps?

But a rapidly changing culture is not necessarily accompanied by parent-child conflict. Other conditions are probably also necessary to generate the conflict, if the situation in a Moroccan town is any guide. As part of a comparative research project on adolescence, Susan and Douglas Davis interviewed young people in a

small town in Morocco. The culture had changed a lot recently. Parents mostly worked at jobs in and related to agriculture; children aspired to white-collar jobs. Grandparents rarely saw a car; teenagers took trains to the capital. Only a few parents went to school; most teenagers did. Yet the Davises reported little serious parent-child conflict, despite the cultural changes. For example, 40 percent of the teenagers said that they had never disagreed with their mothers. Perhaps then we need to consider other facets of the culture. For one thing, Morocco has an authoritarian political structure with a monarchy and a clear pyramid of ofperhaps parent-child fices; conflict is unlikely in such a political system because it emphasizes and requires obedience. A second possible consideration is that group life is more important than the individualthe family is the most important social group and as such cannot tolerate adolescent rebelliousness. A third possible consideration is that adults are supposed to avoid open conflict. The study by the Davises implies then that adolescent rebelliousness is likely only in societies like the United States that emphasize individuality, personal autonomy, and individual achievement.

What we need is research that tries to untangle the various causal possibilities. To discover the possible effect of neolocality, or rapid change, or a cultural emphasis on individual autonomy, or an authoritarian political system, we need to study samples of cultures that have different combinations of those traits. It is possible that they all are influential, or that some are more important than others, or that some cause the others. Whatever we discover about the causality in the future, we know now that adolescent rebelliousness is not inevitable or natural—that it is probably linked to some other aspects of cultural variation-as Margaret Mead suggested many years ago.

(If warfare is purely external but men still do more of the primary subsistence work, residence should still be patrilocal.) Thus, the need to keep sons at home after marriage when there is internal warfare may take precedence over any considerations based on division of labor. It is perhaps only when internal warfare is nonexistent that a female-dominant division of labor may give rise to matrilocal residence.7

The frequent absence of men because of longdistance trade or wage labor in distant places may also provide an impetus for matrilocal residence even after warfare ceases. For example, among the Miskito of eastern Central America, matrilocality allowed domestic and village life to continue without interruption when men were away from home for long periods of time, working as lumberers, miners, and river transporters. These jobs were not always available, but when they were the men went away to work at them in order to earn money. Even though some men would always be away from home, the Miskito continued to get food in their traditional ways, from farming (done mostly by the women) and from hunting and fishing (which was mostly men's work).<sup>8</sup>

#### **Bilocal Residence**

In societies that practice bilocal residence, a married couple goes to live with or near either the husband's or the wife's parents. Although this pattern seems to involve a choice for the married couple, theory and research suggest that bilocal residence may occur out of necessity instead. Elman Service suggested that bilocal residence is likely to occur in societies that have recently suffered a severe and drastic loss of population because of the introduction of new infectious diseases.<sup>9</sup> Over the last 400 years, contact with Europeans in many parts of the world has resulted in severe population losses among non-European societies that lacked resistance to the Europeans' diseases. If couples need to live with some set of kin in order to make a living in noncommercial societies, it seems likely that couples in depopulated, noncommercial societies might have to live with whichever spouse's parents (and other relatives) are still alive. This interpretation seems to be supported by the cross-cultural evidence. Recently depopulated societies tend to have bilocal residence or frequent departures from unilocality, whereas societies that are not recently depopulated tend to have one pattern or another of unilocal residence.<sup>10</sup>

In hunter-gatherer societies, a few other circumstances may also favor bilocal residence. Bilocality tends to be found among those huntergatherers who have very small bands or unpredictable and low rainfall. Residential "choice" in these cases may be a question of adjusting marital residence to where the couple will have the best chance to survive or to find close relatives with whom to live and work.<sup>11</sup>

Figure 11-2 illustrates the main predictors of the various marital residence patterns.

# THE STRUCTURE OF KINSHIP

In noncommercial societies, kinship connections structure many areas of social life—from the kind of access an individual has to productive resources to the kind of political alliances formed between communities and larger territorial groups. In some societies, in fact, kinship connections have an important bearing on matters of life and death.

Recall the social system described in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. The Capulets and the Montagues were groups of kin engaged in lethal competition with each other, and the fatal outcome of Romeo and Juliet's romance was related to that competition. Although Romeo and Juliet's society had a commercial economy (but not, of course, an industrialized one), the political system of the city they lived in was a reflection of the way kinship was structured. Sets of kin of common descent lived together, and the various kin groups competed (and sometimes fought) for a prominent, or at least secure, place in the political hierarchy of the city-state.

If a preindustrial commercial society could be so structured by kinship, we can imagine how much more important kinship connections and kin groups are in many noncommercial societies that lack political mechanisms such as princes and councils of lords who try to keep the peace and initiate other activities on behalf of the community. It is no wonder that anthropologists often speak of the web of kinship as providing the main structure of social action in noncommercial societies.

If kinship is important, there is still the question of which set of kin a person affiliates with and depends on. After all, if every single relative were counted as equally important, there would be an unmanageably large number of people in each person's kinship network. Consequently, in most societies in which kinship connections are important, rules allocate each person to a particular and definable set of kin.

#### Rules of Descent

Rules that connect individuals with particular sets of kin because of known or presumed common ancestry are called **rules of descent**. By the particular rule of descent operating in their society, individuals can know more or less immediately which set of kin to turn to for support and help.

Kin group rivalry between the Capulets and the Montagues made it unacceptable for Romeo and Juliet to court or wed.

![](_page_7_Picture_9.jpeg)

There are only three known rules of descent that affiliate individuals with different sets of kin:

- 1. **Patrilineal descent** (the most frequent rule) affiliates an individual with kin of both sexes related to him or her through men only. As Figure  $11-3$  indicates, in patrilineal systems the children in each generation belong to the kin group of their father; their father, in turn, belongs to the group of his father; and so on. Although a man's sons and daughters are all members of the same descent group, affiliation with that group is transmitted only by the sons to their children.
- 2. Matrilineal descent affiliates an individual with kin of both sexes related to him or

#### FIGURE 11-3 **Patrilineal Descent**

Individuals 4 and 5, who are the children of 1 and 2, affiliate with their father's patrilineal kin group, represented by the color. In the next generation, the children of 3 and 4 also belong to the color kin group, since they take their descent from their father, who is a member of that group. However, the children of 5 and 6 do not belong to this patrilineal group, since they take their descent from their father, who is a member of a different group. That is, although the mother of 12 and 14 belongs to the color patrilineal group, she cannot pass on her descent affiliation to her children, and, since her husband (6) does not belong to her patrilineage, her children (12 and 14) belong to their father's group. In the fourth generation, only 15 and 16 belong to the color patrilineal group, since their father is the only male member of the preceding generation who belongs to the color patrilineal group. In this diagram, then, 1, 4, 5, 8, 10, 15, and 16 are affiliated by patrilineal descent; all the other individuals belong to other patrilineal groups.

her through women only. In each generation, then, children belong to the kin group of their mother (see Figure 11-4). Although a woman's sons and daughters are all members of the same descent group, only her daughters can pass on their descent affiliation to their children.

3. Ambilineal descent affiliates an individual with kin related to him or her through men or women. In other words, some people in the society affiliate with a group of kin through their fathers; others, through their mothers. Consequently, the descent groups show both female and male genealogical links, as illustrated in Figure 11-5.

These three rules are usually, but not always, mutually exclusive. Most societies can be character-

#### FIGURE 11-4 Matrilineal Descent

Individuals 4 and 5, who are the children of 1 and 2, affiliate with their mother's kin group, represented by the color. In the next generation, the children of 5 and 6 also belong to the color kin group since they take their descent from their mother, who is a member of that group. However, the children of 3 and 4 do not belong to this matrilineal group since they take their descent from their mother, who is a member of a different group; their father, although a member of the color matrilineal group, cannot pass his affiliation on to them under the rule of matrilineal descent. In the fourth generation, only 21 and 22 belong to the color matrilineal group, since their mother is the only female member of the preceding generation who belongs. Thus, individuals 2, 4, 5, 12, 14, 21, and 22 belong to the same matrilineal group.

#### FIGURE 11-5 Ambilineal Descent

A hypothetical ambilineal group of kin is indicated by the color. Members 4 and 5 belong to this group because of a male link, their father (1); members 12 and 14 belong because of a female link, their mother (5); and members 19 and 20 belong because of a male link, their father  $(12)$ . This is a hypothetical example because any combination of lineal links is possible in an ambilineal descent group.

ized as having only one rule of descent, but sometimes two principles are used to affiliate individuals with different sets of kin for different purposes. Some societies have then what is called **double de**scent, or double unilineal descent, whereby an individual affiliates for some purposes with a group of matrilineal kin and for other purposes with a group of patrilineal kin. Thus, two rules of descent, each traced through links of one sex only, are operative at the same time. For example, if there is a patrilineal system and a matrilineal one, individuals would belong to *two* groups at birth: the matrilineal group of the mother *and* the patrilineal group of the father. Imagine combining Figures 11-3 and 11-4. Individuals 4 and 5 would belong to both the patrilineal group (purple on Figure  $11-3$ ) to which their father belongs and the matrilineal group (green on Figure  $11-4$ ) to which their mother belongs.

The way a society assigns names does not necessarily convey any information about a rule of descent. It is customary in North American society for children to have a last (or "family") name; it is usually their father's last name. All the people with the same last name do not conceive of themselves as descended from the same common ancestor; all Smiths do not consider themselves related. Nor do such

people act together for any particular purpose. And many societies, even with rules of descent, do not give individuals the name of their kin group, or of their father or mother. For example, among the patrilineal Luo of Kenya, babies were traditionally given names that described the circumstances of their birth ("born-in-the-morning"); their names did not include their father's or kin group's name. (Only after the British established a colony in Kenya, and continuing after independence, did children get their father's personal name as a family name.)

#### BILATERAL KINSHIP

Many societies, including our own, do not have lineal (matrilineal, patrilineal, or ambilineal) descent groups—sets of kin who believe they descend from a common ancestor. These are societies with **bilateral** kinship. Bilateral means "two-sided," and in this case it refers to the fact that one's relatives on both mother's and father's sides are equal in importance or (more usually) in unimportance. Kinship reckoning in bilateral societies does not refer to common descent, but rather is horizontal (see Figure  $11-6$ ), moving outward from close to more distant relatives, rather than upward to common ancestors.

The term kindred describes a person's bilateral set of relatives who may be called upon for some purpose. In our society, we think of the kindred as including the people we might invite to weddings, funerals, or some other ceremonial occasion; the kindred, however, is not usually a definite group. As anyone who has been involved in the planning of a wedding-invitation list knows, a great deal of time may be spent deciding which relatives ought to be invited and which ones can legitimately be excluded. Societies with bilateral kinship differ in precisely how distant relatives have to be before they are lost track of or before they are not included in ceremonial activities. In societies such as our own, in which kinship is relatively unimportant, fewer relatives are included in the kindred. In other bilateral societies, however, where kinship connections are somewhat more important, more would be included.

The distinctive feature of bilateral kinship is that, aside from brothers and sisters, no two persons belong to exactly the same kin group. Your kindred contains close relatives spreading out on both your mother's and father's sides, but the members of your kindred are affiliated only by way of their connection to you (**ego**, or the focus). Thus, the kindred is an ego-centered group of kin. Because different people (except for brothers and sisters) have differ-

![](_page_10_Figure_0.jpeg)

#### FIGURE 11-6 Bilateral Kinship

In a bilateral system the kindred is ego-centered; hence, it varies with different points of reference (except for brothers and sisters). In any bilateral society, the kindred minimally includes parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and first cousins. So, if we look at the close kindred of the brother and sister 20 and 21 (enclosed by the solid line), it would include their parents (9 and 10), their aunts and uncles  $(7, 8, 11, 12)$ , their grandparents  $(1, 2, 3, 4)$  and their first cousins  $(16-19, 22-25)$ . But the kindred of the brother and sister 24 and 25 (shown by the dashed line) includes only some of the same people  $(3, 4, 10-12, 20-23)$ ; in addition, the kindred of 24 and 25 includes people not in the kindred of 20 and 21  $(5, 6, 13-15, 26-29)$ .

ent mothers and fathers, your first cousins will have different kindreds, and even your own children will have a different kindred from yours. It is the egocentered nature of the kindred that makes it difficult for it to serve as a permanent or persistent group. The only thing the people in a kindred have in common is the ego who brings them together. The kindred usually has no name, no common purpose, and only temporary meetings centered around the ego.<sup>12</sup> Furthermore, because everyone belongs to many different and overlapping kindreds, the society is not divided into clear-cut groups.

# UNILINEAL DESCENT

Both matrilineal and patrilineal rules of descent are **unilineal descent** rules, in that a person is affiliated with a group of kin through descent links of one sex only-either males only or females only. Unilineal rules of descent affiliate an individual with a line of kin extending back in time and into the future. By virtue of this line of descent (whether it extends through males or females), some very close relatives are excluded. For example, in a patrilineal system, your mother and your mother's parents do not belong to your patrilineal group, but your father and

his father (and their sisters) do. In your own generation in a matrilineal or patrilineal system, some cousins are excluded, and in your children's generation, some of your nieces and nephews are excluded.

However, although unilineal rules of descent exclude certain relatives from membership in one's kin group (just as practical considerations restrict the effective size of kinship networks in our own society), the excluded relatives are not necessarily ignored or forgotten. Indeed, in many unilineal societies they may be entrusted with important responsibilities. For example, when a person dies in a patrilineal society, some members of his or her mother's patrilineal descent group may customarily be accorded the right to perform certain rituals at the funeral.

Unlike bilateral kinship, unilineal rules of descent can form clear-cut, and hence unambiguous, groups of kin, which can act as separate units even after the death of individual members. Referring again to Figures  $11-3$  and  $11-4$ , we can see that the individuals in the highlight color belong to the same patrilineal or matrilineal descent group without ambiguity—an individual in the fourth generation belongs to the group just as much as one in the first generation. If we imagine that the patrilineal group, for instance, has a name, say the Hawks, then an individual knows immediately whether or not she or

he is a Hawk. If the individual is not a Hawk, then he or she belongs to some other group—for each person belongs to only one line.

This fact is important if kin groups are to act as separate or nonoverlapping units. It is difficult for people to act together unless they know exactly who should get together. And it is easier for individuals to act together as a group if each one belongs to only one such group or line. Recall that in a bilateral system, not only is it sometimes unclear where the boundary of the kindred is, but one person belongs to many different kindreds—one's own and others' (children's, cousins', and so forth). Consequently, it is not surprising that a kindred gets together only temporarily for ceremonial occasions.

#### Types of Unilineal Descent Groups

In a society with unilineal descent, people usually refer to themselves as belonging to a particular unilineal group or set of groups because they believe they share common descent in either the male line (patrilineal) or the female line (matrilineal). These people form what is called a *unilineal descent* group. Several types of unilineal descent groups are distinguished by anthropologists: lineages, clans, phratries, and moieties.

*Lineages.* A **lineage** is a set of kin whose members trace descent from a common ancestor through known links. There may be patrilineages or matri**lineages**, depending, of course, on whether the links are traced through males only or through females only. Lineages are often designated by the name of the common ancestor or ancestress. In some societies, people belong to a hierarchy of lineages. That is, they first trace their descent back to the ancestor of a minor lineage, then to the ancestor of a larger and more inclusive major lineage, and so on.

Clans. A clan (also called a sib) is a set of kin whose members believe themselves to be descended from a common ancestor or ancestress, but the links back to that ancestor are not specified. In fact, the common ancestor may not even be known. Clans with patrilineal descent are called patriclans; clans with matrilineal descent are called matriclans. Clans often are designated by an animal or plant name (called a totem), which may have some special significance for the group and at the very least provides a means of group identification. Thus, if someone says she or he belongs to the Bear, Wolf, or Turtle clan, for example, others will know whether or not that person is a clan member.

The word totem comes from the Ojibwa Indian word ototeman, "a relative of mine." In some societies, people have to observe taboos relating to their clan totem animal. For example, clan members may be forbidden to kill or eat their totem.

Although it may seem strange to us that an animal or plant should be a symbol of a kin group, animals as symbols of groups are familiar in our own culture. Football and baseball teams, for example, are often named for animals (Detroit Tigers, Los Angeles Rams, Philadelphia Eagles, Chicago Bears). Voluntary associations, such as men's clubs,

Many Northwest Pacific Coast Indians constructed totem poles representing the animal totems and human ancestors of their clans. Shown here are totem poles and a reconstructed house in Victoria, British Columbia.

are sometimes called by the name of an animal (Elks, Moose, Lions). Entire nations may be represented by an animal; we speak, for instance, of the American Eagle and the British Lion.<sup>13</sup> Why humans so often choose animal names to represent groups is an intriguing question to which we have no tested answer as yet.

Phratries. A phratry is a unilineal descent group composed of supposedly related clans or sibs. As with clans, the descent links in phratries are unspecified.

Moieties. When a whole society is divided into two unilineal descent groups, we call each group a moiety. (The word *moiety* comes from a French word meaning "half.") The people in each moiety believe themselves to be descended from a common ancestor, although they cannot specify how. Societies with moiety systems usually have relatively small populations (fewer than 9,000 people). Societies with phratries and clans tend to be larger.<sup>14</sup>

Combinations. Although we have distinguished several different types of unilineal descent groups, we do not wish to imply that all unilineal societies have only one type of descent group. Many societies have two or more types in various combinations. For example, some societies have lineages and clans; others may have clans and phratries but no lineages; and still others may have clans and moieties but neither phratries nor lineages. Aside from the fact that a society that has phratries must also have clans (since phratries are combinations of clans), all combinations of descent groups are possible. Even if societies have more than one type of unilineal kin group-for example, lineages and clans-there is no ambiguity about membership: small groups are simply subsets of larger units. The larger units include people who say they are unilineally related further back in time.

#### Patrilineal Organization

Patrilineal organization is the most frequent type of descent system. The Kapauku Papuans, a people living in the central highlands of western New Guinea, are an example of a patrilineal society with many types of descent groups.<sup>15</sup> The hierarchy of groups to which Kapauku are affiliated by virtue of the patrilineal descent system plays an extremely important part in their lives. Every Kapauku belongs to a patrilineage, to a patriclan that includes his or her lineage, and to a patriphratry that includes his or her clan.

The male members of a patrilineage—all the living males who can trace their actual relationship through males to a common ancestor-constitute the male population of a single village or, more likely, a series of adjoining villages. In other words, the lineage is a *territorial* unit. The male members of the lineage live together by virtue of a patrilocal rule of residence and a fairly stable settlement pattern. A son stays near his parents and brings his wife to live in or near his father's house; the daughters leave home and go to live with their husbands. If the group lives in one place over a long period, the male descendants of one man will live in the same territory. If the lineage is large, it may be divided into sublineages composed of people who trace their descent from one of the sons of the lineage ancestor. The male members of a sublineage live in a contiguous block within the larger lineage territory.

The members of the same patrilineage address each other affectionately, and within this group law and order are maintained by a headman. Killing within the lineage is considered a serious offense, and any fighting that takes place is done with sticks rather than lethal weapons such as spears. The sublineage headman tries to settle any kind of grievance within the sublineage as quickly and as peacefully as possible. If a sublineage mate commits a crime against outsiders, all members of the sublineage may be considered responsible and their property seized, or a member of the sublineage may be killed in revenge by the victim's kin.

The Kapauku also belong to larger and more inclusive patrilineal descent groups-clans and phratries. All the people of the same clan believe they are related to each other in the father's line, but they are unable to say how they are related. If a member of the patriclan eats the clan's plant or animal totem, it is believed that the person will become deaf. A Kapauku is also forbidden to marry anyone from his or her clan. In other words, the clan is exogamous.

Unlike the members of the patrilineage, the male members of the patriclan do not all live together. Thus, the lineage is the largest group of patrilineal kinsmen that is localized. The lineage is also the largest group of kinsmen that acts together politically. Among clan members there is no mechanism for resolving disputes, and members of the same patriclan (who belong to different lineages) may even go to war with one another.

The most inclusive patrilineal descent group among the Kapauku is the phratry, each of which is composed of two or more clans. The Kapauku believe that the phratry was originally one clan, but that in a conflict between brothers of the founding family the younger brother was expelled and formed a new clan. The two resulting clans are, of course, viewed as patrilineally related, since their founders are said to have been brothers. The members of a phratry observe all the totemic taboos of the clans that belong to that phratry. Intermarriage of members of the same clan is forbidden, but members of the same phratry (if they belong to different clans) may marry.

The Kapauku, then, are an example of a unilineal society with many types of descent groups. They have lineages with demonstrated kinship links and two kinds of descent groups with unknown descent links (clans and phratries).

#### Matrilineal Organization

Although societies with matrilineal descent seem in many respects like mirror images of their patrilineal counterparts, they differ in one important way. That difference has to do with who exercises authority. In patrilineal systems, descent affiliation is transmitted through males, and it is also the males who exercise authority. Consequently, in the patrilineal system, lines of descent and of authority converge. In a matrilineal system, however, although the line of descent passes through females, females rarely exercise authority in their kin groups—usually males do.

Thus, the lines of authority and descent do not converge.<sup>16</sup> Anthropologists do not quite understand why this is so, but it is an ethnographic fact. In any case, since males exercise authority in the kin group, an individual's mother's brother becomes an important authority figure, because he is the individual's closest male matrilineal relative in the parental generation. The individual's father does not belong to the individual's own matrilineal kin group and thus has no say in kin group matters.

The divergence of authority and descent in a matrilineal system has some effect on community organization and marriage. Most matrilineal societies practice matrilocal residence. Daughters stay at home after marriage and bring their husbands to live with them; sons leave home to join their wives. But the sons who are required to leave will be the ones who eventually exercise authority in their kin groups. This situation presents a problem. The solution that seems to have been arrived at in most matrilineal societies is that, although the males move away to live with their wives, they usually do not move too far away—indeed, they often marry women who live in the same village. Thus, matrilineal societies tend not to be locally exogamous—that is, members often marry people from inside the village—whereas patrilineal societies are often locally exogamous.<sup>17</sup>

The matrilineal organization on Truk, a group of small islands in the Pacific, illustrates the

Reconstruction of an Iroquois longhouse, which housed a matrilineal descent group

![](_page_13_Picture_8.jpeg)

general pattern of authority in matrilineal systems.<sup>18</sup> The Trukese have both matrilineages and matriclans. The matrilineage is a property-owning group whose members trace descent from a known common ancestress in the female line. The female lineage members and their husbands occupy a cluster of houses on the matrilineage's land. The property of the lineage group is administered by the oldest brother of the group. He allocates the productive property of his matrilineage and directs the work of the members. The oldest brother of the lineage also represents the group in dealings with the district chief and all outsiders, and he must be consulted on any matter that affects the group. There is also a senior woman of the lineage who exercises some authority, but only insofar as the activities of the women are concerned. She may supervise the women's cooperative work (they usually work separately from the men) and manage the household.

Within the nuclear family, the father and mother have the primary responsibility for raising and disciplining their children. When a child reaches puberty, however, the father's right to discipline or exercise authority over the child ceases. The mother continues to exercise her right of discipline, and her brother may interfere. A woman's brother rarely interferes with his sister's child before puberty, but after puberty he may exercise some authority, especially since he is an elder in the child's own matrilineage. On Truk, men rarely move far from their birthplace. As Ward Goodenough pointed out, "Since matrilocal residence takes the men away from their home lineages, most of them marry women whose lineage houses are within a few minutes' walk of their own."19

Although there are some differences between patrilineal and matrilineal systems, there are many similarities. In both types of systems there may be lineages, clans, phratries, and moieties, alone or in any combination. These kin groups, in either matrilineal or patrilineal societies, may perform any number of functions. They may regulate marriage; they may come to each other's aid either economically or politically; and they may perform rituals together.

Now that we have learned something about matrilineal systems, the avunculocal pattern of residence, whereby married couples live with or near the husband's mother's brother, may become clearer. Although avunculocal residence is relatively rare, just about all avunculocal societies are matrilineal. As we have seen, the mother's brother plays an important role in decision making in most matrilineal societies. Aside from his brothers, who is a boy's closest male matrilineal relative? His mother's

brother. Going to live with mother's brother, then, provides a way of localizing male matrilineal relatives. But why should some matrilineal societies practice that form of residence? The answer may involve the prevailing type of warfare.

Avunculocal societies, in contrast with matrilocal societies, fight internally. Just as patrilocality may be a response to keep (patrilineally) related men home after marriage, so avunculocality may be a way of keeping related (in this case, matrilineally related) men together after marriage to provide for quick mobilization in case of surprise attack from nearby. Societies that already have strong, functioning matrilineal descent groups may, when faced with fighting close to home and high male mortality, choose to practice avunculocality rather than switch to patrilocality.<sup>20</sup>

#### **Functions of Unilineal** Descent Groups

Unilineal descent groups exist in societies at all levels of cultural complexity.<sup>21</sup> Apparently however, they are most common in noncommercial food-producing (as opposed to food-collecting) societies.<sup>22</sup> Unilineal descent groups often have important functions in the social, economic, political, and religious realms of life.

Regulating Marriage. In unilineal societies, individuals are not usually permitted to marry within their own unilineal descent groups. In some, however, marriage may be permitted within more inclusive kin groups but prohibited within smaller kin groups. In a few societies, marriage within the kin group is actually preferred.

But in general, the incest taboo in unilineal societies is extended to all presumed unilineal relatives. For example, on Truk, which has matriclans and matrilineages, a person is forbidden by the rule of descent group exogamy to marry anyone from her or his matriclan. The matrilineage is included within the matriclan, so the rule of descent group exogamy also applies to the matrilineage. Among the Kapauku, who have patriphratries, patriclans, and patrilineages, the largest descent group that is exogamous is the patriclan. The phratry may once have been exogamous, but the exogamy rule no longer applies to it. Some anthropologists have suggested that rules of exogamy for descent groups may have developed because the alliances between descent groups generated by such rules may be selectively favored under the conditions of life faced by most unilineal societies.

Economic Functions. Members of a person's lineage or clan are often required to side with that person in any quarrel or lawsuit, to help him or her get established economically, to contribute to a bride price or fine, and to support the person in life crises. Mutual aid often extends to economic cooperation on a regular basis. The unilineal descent group may act as a corporate unit in land ownership. For example, house sites and farmland are owned by a lineage among the Trukese and the Kapauku. Descent group members may also support one another in such enterprises as clearing virgin bush or forest for farmland and providing food and other things for feasts, potlatches, curing rites, and ceremonial occasions, such as births, initiations, marriages, and funerals.

Money earned-either by harvesting a cash crop or by leaving the community for a time to work for cash wages—is sometimes viewed by the descent group as belonging to all. In recent times, however, young people in some places have shown an unwillingness to part with their money, viewing it as different from other kinds of economic assistance.

Political Functions. The word political, as used by members of an industrialized society, generally does not apply to the rather vague powers that may be entrusted to a headman or the elders of a lineage or clan. But these persons may have the right to assign land for use by a lineage member or a clan member. Headmen or elders may also have the right to settle disputes between two members within a lineage, although they generally lack power to force a settlement. And they may act as intermediaries in disputes between a member of their own clan and a member of an opposing kin group.

Certainly one of the most important political functions of unilineal descent groups is their role in warfare—the attempt to resolve disputes within and without the society by violent action. In societies without towns or cities, the organization of such fighting is often in the hands of descent groups. The Tiv of central Nigeria, for instance, know quite well at any given moment which lineages they will fight against, which lineages they will join as allies in case of a fight, which they will fight against using only sticks, and which must be attacked using bows and arrows.

*Religious Functions.* A clan or lineage may have its own religious beliefs and practices, worshiping its own gods or goddesses and ancestral spirits. The Tallensi of West Africa revere and try to pacify their ancestors. They view life as we know it as only a part of human existence: for them, life existed before

birth and will continue after death. The Tallensi believe that the ancestors of their descent groups have changed their form but have retained their interest in what goes on within their society. They can show their displeasure by bringing sudden disaster or minor mishap and their pleasure by bringing unexpected good fortune. But people can never tell what will please them; ancestral spirits are, above all, unpredictable. Thus, the Tallensi try to account for unexplainable happenings by attributing them to the ever-watchful ancestors. Belief in the presence of ancestors also provides security; if their ancestors have survived death, so will they. The Tallensi religion is thus a descent-group religion. The Tallensi are not concerned with other people's ancestors; they believe it is only one's own ancestors who plague or protect one.<sup>23</sup>

#### **Development of Unilineal Systems**

Unilineal kin groups play very important roles in the organization of many societies. But not all societies have such groups. In societies that have complex systems of political organization, officials and agencies take over many of the functions that might be performed by kin groups, such as the organization of work and warfare and the allocation of land. But not all societies that lack complex political organization have unilineal descent systems. Why, then, do some societies have unilineal descent systems but others do not?

It is generally assumed that unilocal residence (patrilocal or matrilocal) is necessary for the development of unilineal descent. Patrilocal residence, if practiced for some time in a society, will generate a set of patrilineally related males who live in the same territory. Matrilocal residence over time will similarly generate a localized set of matrilineally related females. It is no wonder, then, that matrilocal and patrilocal residence are cross-culturally associated with matrilineal and patrilineal descent, respectively.<sup>24</sup>

But, although unilocal residence might be necessary for the formation of unilineal descent groups, it is apparently not the only condition required. For one thing, many societies with unilocal residence lack unilineal descent groups. For another, merely because related males or related females live together by virtue of a patrilocal or matrilocal rule of residence, it does not necessarily follow that the related people will actually view themselves as a descent group and function as such. Thus, it appears that other conditions are needed to supply the impetus for the formation of unilineal descent groups.

There is some evidence that unilocal societies that engage in warfare are more apt to have unilineal descent groups than unilocal societies without warfare.<sup>25</sup> It may be, then, that the presence of fighting in societies lacking complex systems of political organization provides an impetus to the formation of unilineal descent groups. Unilineal descent groups provide individuals with unambiguous groups of persons who can fight or form alliances as discrete units.<sup>26</sup> There is no ambiguity about an individual's membership. It is perfectly clear whether someone belongs to a particular clan, phratry, or moiety. It is

this feature of unilineal descent groups that enables them to act as separate and distinct units-mostly, perhaps, in warfare.

Bilateral systems, in contrast, are egocentered, and every person, other than siblings, has a slightly different set of kin to rely on. Consequently, in bilateral societies it is often not clear to whom one can turn and which person has responsibility for aiding another. Such ambiguity, however, might not be a liability in societies without warfare or in societies with political systems that organize fighting on behalf of large populations.

#### VARIATION IN RESIDENCE AND KINSHIP: WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE TO WOMEN?

When we say that residence and kinship have profound effects on people's lives, what exactly do we mean? We may imagine that it is hard for a woman in a patrilocal society to move at marriage into another village where her husband has plenty of relatives and she has few. But do we have evidence of that? Most ethnographies usually do not give details about people's feelings. But some do. For example, Leigh Minturn gives us the text of a letter that one new Rajput bride (who grew up in the village of Khalapur, India) sent to her mother shortly after she married into her husband's village. The letter was written when the bride had been gone six weeks, but she repeatedly asked if her mother, her father, her aunts had forgotten her. She begged to be called home and said her bags were packed. She described herself as

繁糕!

二卷 。

"a parrot in a cage" and complained about her in-laws. The bride's mother was not alarmed; she knew that such complaints were normal, reflections of her daughter's separation anxiety. Seven years later when Minturn returned to India, the daughter was reported by the mother to be happy. Still, a few other brides did have more serious symptoms: ghost possession, twentyfour to thirty-six hour comas, serious depression, or suicide. What research has not told us yet is whether these serious symptoms among women are present more often in patrilocal, patrilineal societies than in other societies (particularly matrilocal, matrilineal societies). Conversely, do men have some symptoms in matrilocal, matrilineal societies that they do not have in patrilocal societies? We do not know yet.

What about the status of women? Some research suggests that matrilocality and matrilineality enhance some aspects of women's status, but perhaps not as much as we might think. (Even in matrilineal societies, men are usually the political leaders.) The main effect of matrilocality and matrilineality appears to be that women control property, but they also tend to have more domestic authority in the home, more equal sexual restrictions, and more value placed on their lives. Alice Schlegel pointed out that women's status is not always relatively high in matrilineal societies, because they can be dominated by the husband or by brothers (because brothers play important roles in their kin groups). It is only when neither the husband nor the brother dominates that women may have considerable control

#### AMBILINEAL SYSTEMS

Societies with ambilineal descent groups are far less numerous than unilineal or even bilateral societies. Ambilineal societies, however, resemble unilineal ones in many ways. For instance, the members of an ambilineal descent group believe that they are descended from a common ancestor, though frequently they cannot specify all the genealogical links. The descent group is commonly named and may have an identifying emblem or even a totem; land and other productive resources may be owned by the descent group; and myths and religious practices are often associated with the group. Marriage is often regulated by group membership, just as in unilineal systems, though kin group exogamy is not nearly as common as in unilineal systems. Moreover, ambilineal societies resemble unilineal ones in having various levels or types of descent groups. They may have lineages and higher orders of descent groups, distinguished (as in unilineal systems) by whether or not all the genealogical links to the supposed common ancestors are specified.<sup>27</sup>

over their own lives. Certainly the combination of matrilocality and matrilineality is better for women's status than patrilocality and patrilineality. Matrilocality and matrilineality might not enhance women's status because of the dominance of male matrilineal kin, but patrilocality and patrilineality are very likely to detract from women's status. Norma Diamond stated that even after the Chinese Communist revolution, which abolished the landholding estates of patrilineages and gave women access to education as well as jobs outside the home, male dominance continued. The mode of production and labor changed, but patrilocality did not. Women were still usually the in-marrying strangers, and members of the patrilineage became a work team on the collective farm. Diamond pointed out that those few women who became local leaders were likely to have atypical marriages that allowed them to live

in the villages of their birth.

Residence and descent also predict societal attempts to control reproduction. According to Suzanne Frayser, patrilineal societies have several sexual and reproductive dilemmas. One dilemma is the contradiction between the importance of males in kinship and the women's role in reproduction. If patrilineal societies denigrate women too much, women may try to decrease their reproduction. If patrilineal societies exalt women too much, that exaltation may detract from the value of men. A second dilemma has to do with paternity, which is essential for patrilineal descent but harder than maternity to be certain of. Frayser argued that because kin group links are traced through males in patrilineal societies, they will do more to assure that the man a woman marries is the father. Frayser suggested that patrilineal societies therefore will be more restrictive about a woman's sexuality. Indeed, the results of her crosscultural study indicate that patrilineal societies are more likely than other societies to prohibit premarital and extramarital sex for women, and they are more likely to make it very difficult for a woman to divorce her husband.

The Samoans of the South Pacific are an example of an ambilineal society.<sup>28</sup> There are two types of ambilineal descent groups in Samoa, corresponding to what would be called clans and subclans in a unilineal society. Both groups are exogamous. Associated with each ambilineal clan are one or more chiefs. A group takes its name from the senior chief; subclans, of which there are always at least two, may take their names from junior chiefs.

The distinctiveness of the Samoan ambilineal system, compared with unilineal systems, is that because an individual may be affiliated with an ambilineal group through her or his father or mother (and her or his parents, in turn, could be affiliated with any of their parents' groups), there are a number of ambilineal groups to which that individual could belong. Affiliation with a Samoan descent group is optional, and a person may theoretically affiliate with any or all of the ambilineal groups to which she or he is related. In practice, however, a person is primarily associated with one group—the ambilineal group whose land he or she actually lives on and cultivates—although he or she may participate in the activities (house building, for example) of several groups. Because a person may belong to more than one ambilineal group, the society is not divided into separate kin groups, in contrast with unilineal societies. Consequently, the core members of each ambilineal group cannot all live together (as they could in unilineal societies), because each person belongs to more than one group and cannot live in several places at once.

Not all ambilineal societies have the multiple descent group membership that occurs in Samoa. In some ambilineal societies, a person may belong (at any one time) to only one group. In such cases, the society can be divided into separate, nonoverlapping groups of kin.

Why do some societies have ambilineal descent groups? Although the evidence is not clear-cut on this point, it may be that societies with unilineal descent groups are transformed into ambilineal ones under special conditions—particularly in the presence of depopulation. We have already noted that depopulation may transform a previously unilocal society into a bilocal society. If that previously unilocal society also had unilineal descent groups, the descent groups may become transformed into ambilineal groups. If a society used to be patrilocal and patrilineal, for example, but some couples began to live matrilocally, then their children would be associated with a previously patrilineal descent group (on whose land they may be living) through their mother. Once this situation happens regularly, the unilineal principle may become transformed into an ambilineal principle.<sup>29</sup> Thus, ambilineal descent systems may have developed recently as a result of depopulation caused by the introduction of European diseases.

#### KINSHIP TERMINOLOGY

Our society, like all others, refers to a number of different kin by the same **classificatory term**. Most of us probably never stop to think about why we name relatives the way we do. For example, we call our mother's brother and father's brother (and often mother's sister's husband and father's sister's husband) by the same term—*uncle*. It is not that we are unable to distinguish between our mother's or father's brother or that we do not know the difference between consanguineal kin (blood kin) and affinal kin (kin by marriage, or what we call in-laws). Instead, it seems that in our society we do not usually find it necessary to distinguish between various types of uncles.

However natural our system of classification may seem to us, countless field studies by anthropologists have revealed that societies differ markedly in how they group or distinguish relatives. The kinship terminology used in a society may reflect its prevailing kind of family, its rule of residence and its rule of descent, and other aspects of its social organization. Kin terms may also give clues to prior features of the society's social system, if, as many anthropologists believe,<sup>30</sup> the kin terms of a society are very resistant to change. The major systems of kinship terminology are the Omaha system, the Crow system, the Iroquois system, the Sudanese system, the Hawaiian system, and the Inuit (Eskimo) system.

Because it is the most familiar to us, let us first consider the kinship terminology system employed in our own and many other commercial societies. But it is by no means confined to commercial societies—in fact, this system is found in many Inuit (Eskimo) societies.

#### Inuit, or Eskimo, System

The distinguishing features of the Inuit, or Eskimo, system (see Figure 11-7) are that all cousins are lumped together under the same term but are distinguished from brothers and sisters, and all aunts and uncles are lumped under the same terms but are distinguished from mother and father. In Figure  $11-7$  and in subsequent figures, the kin types that

![](_page_19_Figure_0.jpeg)

FIGURE 11-7 Inuit (Eskimo) Kinship Terminology System

are referred to by the same term are colored and marked in the same way; for example, in the Inuit system, kin types 2 (father's brother) and 6 (mother's brother) are referred to by the same term (uncle in English). Note that in this system, in contrast to the others we examine below, no other relatives are generally referred to by the same terms used for members of the nuclear family-mother, father, brother, and sister.

The Inuit type of kinship terminology is not generally found where there are unilineal or ambilineal descent groups; the only kin group that appears to be present is the bilateral kindred.<sup>31</sup> Remember that the kindred in a bilateral kinship system is an ego-centered group. Although relatives on both my mother's and my father's sides are equally important, my most important relatives are generally those closest to me. This is particularly true in our society, where the nuclear family generally lives alone, separated from and not particularly involved with other relatives except on ceremonial occasions. Because the nuclear family is most important, we would expect to find that the kin types in the nuclear family are distinguished terminologically from all other relatives. And the mother's and father's sides are equally important (or unimportant), so it makes sense that we use the same terms (aunt, uncle, and cousin) for both sides of the family.

#### Omaha System

The Omaha system of kin terminology is named after the Omaha of North America, but the system is found in many societies around the world, usually those with patrilineal descent.<sup>32</sup> Referring to Figure  $11-8$ , we can see immediately which types of kin are lumped together in an Omaha system. First, father and father's brother (numbers 2 and 3) are both referred to by the same term. This way of classifying

![](_page_19_Figure_6.jpeg)

FIGURE 11-8 Omaha Kinship Terminology System

relatives contrasts markedly with ours, in which no term that applies to a member of the nuclear family (father, mother, brother, sister) is applied to any other relative. What could account for the Omaha system of lumping? One interpretation is that father and father's brother are lumped in this system because most societies in which this system is found have patrilineal kin groups. Both father and father's brother are in the parental generation of my patrilineal kin group and may behave toward me similarly. My father's brother also probably lives near me, since patrilineal societies usually have patrilocal residence. The term for father and father's brother, then, might be translated "male member of my patrilineal kin group in my father's generation."

A second lumping (which at first glance appears similar to the lumping of father and father's brother) is that of mother and mother's sister (4 and 5), both of whom are called by the same term. But more surprisingly, mother's brother's daughter (16) is also referred to by this term. Why? If we think of the term as meaning "female member of my mother's patrilineage of any generation," then the term makes sense. Consistent with this view, all the male members of my mother's patrilineage of any generation (mother's brother, 6; mother's brother's son, 15) are also referred to by one term.

It is apparent, then, that relatives on the father's and the mother's sides are grouped differently in this system. For members of my mother's patrilineal kin group, I lump all male members together and all female members together regardless of their generation. Yet, for members of my father's patrilineal kin group, I have different terms for the male and female members of different generations. George Peter Murdock suggested that a society lumps kin types when there are more similarities than differences among them.<sup>33</sup>

Using this principle, and recognizing that societies with an Omaha system usually are patrilineal, I realize that my father's patrilineal kin group is the one to which I belong and in which I have a great many rights and obligations. Consequently, persons of my father's generation are likely to behave quite differently toward me than are persons of my own generation. Members of my patrilineal group in my father's generation are likely to exercise authority over me, and I am required to show them respect. Members of my patrilineal group in my own generation are those I am likely to play with as a child and to be friends with. Thus, in a patrilineal system, persons on my father's side belonging to different generations are likely to be distinguished. On the other hand, my mother's patrilineage is relatively unimportant to me (since I take my descent from my father). And because my residence is probably patrilocal, my mother's relatives will probably not even live near me. Thus, inasmuch as my mother's patrilineal relatives are comparatively unimportant in such a system, they become similar enough to be lumped together.

Finally, in the Omaha system, I refer to my male parallel cousins (my father's brother's son, 9, and my mother's sister's son, 13) in the same way I refer to my brother (number 11). I refer to my female parallel cousins (my father's brother's daughter, 10, and my mother's sister's daughter, 14) in the same way I refer to my sister (12). Considering that my father's brother and mother's sister are referred to by the same terms I use for my father and mother, this lumping of parallel cousins with siblings (brothers and sisters) is not surprising. If I call my own mother's and father's children (other than myself) "Brother" and "Sister," then the children of anyone whom I also call "Mother" and "Father" ought to be called "Brother" and "Sister" as well.

#### Crow System

The Crow system, named after another North American culture, has been called the mirror image of the Omaha system. The same principles of lumping kin types are employed, except that the Crow system is associated with matrilineal descent,<sup>34</sup> so the individuals in my mother's matrilineal group (which is my own) are not lumped across generations, whereas the individuals in my father's matrilineal group are. By comparing Figure 11-9 with Figure 11-8, we find that the lumping and separating of kin types are much the same in both, except that the lumping across generations in the Crow system appears on the father's side rather than on the mother's side. In other words, I call both my mother and my mother's sister by the

FIGURE 11-9 Crow Kinship Terminology System

same term (since both are female members of my matrilineal descent group in my mother's generation). I call my father, my father's brother, and my father's sister's son by the same term (all male members of my father's matrilineal group in any generation). I call my father's sister and my father's sister's daughter by the same term (both female members of my father's matrilineal group). And I refer to my parallel cousins in the same way I refer to my brother and sister.

#### Iroquois System

The Iroquois system, named after the Iroquois of North America, is similar to both the Omaha and Crow systems in the way in which I refer to relatives in my parents' generation (see Figure 11-10). That is, my father and my father's brother (2 and 3) are referred to by the same term, and my mother and my mother's sister (4 and 5) are referred to by the same term. However, the Iroquois system differs from the Omaha and Crow systems regarding my own generation. In the Omaha and Crow systems, one set of cross-cousins was lumped in the kinship

![](_page_20_Figure_10.jpeg)

terminology with the generation above. In the Iroquois system both sets of cross-cousins (mother's brother's children, 15 and 16, and father's sister's children, 7 and 8) are referred to by the same terms, distinguished by sex. That is, mother's brother's daughter and father's sister's daughter are both referred to by the same term. Also, mother's brother's son and father's sister's son are referred to by the same term. Parallel cousins always have terms different from those for cross-cousins and are sometimes, but not always, referred to by the same terms as one's brother and sister.

Like the Omaha and Crow systems, the Iroquois system has different terms for relatives on the father's and mother's sides. Such differentiation tends to be associated with unilineal descent, which is not surprising since unilineal descent involves affiliation with either mother's or father's kin. Why Iroquois, rather than Omaha or Crow, terminology occurs in a unilineal society requires explanation. One possible explanation is that Omaha or Crow is likely to occur in a developed, as opposed to a developing or decaying, unilineal system.<sup>35</sup> Another possible explanation is that Iroquois terminology emerges in societies that prefer marriage with both cross-cousins,<sup>36</sup> who are differentiated from other relatives in an Iroquois system.

#### Sudanese System

One other system of kinship terminology is associated with unilineal descent—the Sudanese system. But, unlike the Omaha, Crow, and Iroquois systems we have examined so far, the Sudanese system usually does not lump any relatives in the parents' and ego's generations. That is, the Sudanese system is usually a *descriptive* system, in which a different **de**scriptive term is used for each of the relatives shown in Figure 11-11. What kinds of societies are likely to have such a system? Although societies with Sudanese terminology are likely to be patrilineal, they probably are different from most patrilineal

#### **FIGURE 11–11** Sudanese Kinship Terminology System

societies that have Omaha or Iroquois terms. Sudanese terminology is associated with relatively great political complexity, class stratification, and occupational specialization. It has been suggested that under such conditions, a kinship system may reflect the need to make fine distinctions among members of descent groups who have different opportunities and privileges in the occupational or class system.<sup>37</sup>

The Omaha, Crow, Iroquois, and Sudanese systems, although different from one another and associated with somewhat different predictors, share one important feature: the terms used for the mother's and father's side of the family are not the same. If you imagine folding the kinship terminology diagrams in half, the two sides would not be the same. As we have seen, in the Inuit system, however, the terms on the mother's and father's side of the family are exactly the same. This feature suggests that the two sides of the family are equally important, or equally unimportant. The next system—Hawaiian—also has the same terms on both sides, but kinship outside the nuclear family is more important.

#### Hawaiian System

The Hawaiian system of kinship terminology is the least complex in that it uses the smallest number of terms. In this system, all relatives of the same sex in the same generation are referred to by the same term (see Figure 11–12). Thus, all my female cousins are referred to by the same term as my sister; all male cousins are referred to by the same term as my brother. Everyone known to be related to me in my parents' generation is referred to by one term if female (including my mother) and by another term if male (including my father).

The fact that societies with Hawaiian kin terminology tend not to have unilineal descent groups<sup>38</sup> helps explain why kinship terms are the same on both sides of the family. Why are the

#### **FIGURE 11-12** Hawaiian Kinship Terminology System

![](_page_21_Figure_12.jpeg)

terms for mother, father, sister, and brother used for other relatives? Perhaps because societies with Hawaiian terminology are likely to have large extended families<sup>39</sup> to which every type of relative in Figure 11-12 may belong because of alternative

(bilocal) residence patterns.<sup>40</sup> So, in contrast to our own society, many kin are quite important, a fact that seems to be reflected in the practice of referring to other relatives with the same terms that are used for nuclear family members.

## V SUMMARY

1. In our society, and in many other industrial societies, a newly married couple usually establishes a place of residence apart from parents or relatives (neolocal residence). But about 95 percent of the world's societies have some pattern of residence whereby the new couple settles within, or very close to, the household of the parents or some other close relative of the groom or bride.

2. The four major patterns in which married couples live with or near kinsmen are these:

- a. Patrilocal residence. The couple lives with or near the husband's parents (67 percent of all societies).
- b. Matrilocal residence. The couple lives with or near the wife's parents (15 percent of all societies).
- c. Bilocal residence. The couple lives with or near either the husband's parents or the wife's parents (7 percent of all societies).
- d. Avunculocal residence. The son and his wife settle with or near his mother's brother (4 percent of all societies).

3. In most societies in which kinship connections are important, a rule allocates each person to a particular and definable set of kin. The rules affiliating individuals with sets of kin are called rules of descent.

4. Rules of descent affiliate individuals with different sets of kin. There are only three known rules of descent:

- Patrilineal descent affiliates an individual a. with kin of both sexes related to him or her through men only. In each generation, then, children belong to the kin group of their father.
- b. Matrilineal descent affiliates an individual with kin related to her or him through women only. In each generation, then, children belong to the kin group of their mother.
- Ambilineal descent affiliates an individ-C.

ual with kin related to him or her through either men or women. Consequently, the descent groups show both female and male genealogical links.

Societies without lineal descent rules are 5. bilateral societies. Relatives on both the mother's and father's sides of the family are of equal importance or (more usually) unimportance. Kindreds are ego-centered sets of kin who may be called together temporarily for some purpose.

6. With unilineal descent (patrilineal or matrilineal), people usually refer to themselves as belonging to a particular unilineal group or set of groups because they believe they share common descent in either the male or the female line. These people form what is called a unilineal descent group. There are several types:

- a. Lineages are sets of kin whose members trace descent from a common ancestor through known links.
- b. Clans are sets of kin who believe they are descended from a common ancestor but cannot specify the genealogical links.
- Phratries are groups of suppos-C. edly related clans.
- Moieties are said to exist when the whole d. society is divided into two unilineal descent groups without specified links to the supposed common ancestor of each.

7. Unilineal descent groups are most common in societies in the middle range of cultural complexity-that is, in noncommercial foodproducing (as opposed to food-collecting) societies. In such societies, unilineal descent groups often have important functions in the social, economic, political, and religious realms of life.

8. Societies differ markedly in how they group or distinguish relatives under the same or different kinship terms. The major systems of terminology are the Inuit (Eskimo), Omaha, Crow, Iroquois, Sudanese, and Hawaiian systems.
