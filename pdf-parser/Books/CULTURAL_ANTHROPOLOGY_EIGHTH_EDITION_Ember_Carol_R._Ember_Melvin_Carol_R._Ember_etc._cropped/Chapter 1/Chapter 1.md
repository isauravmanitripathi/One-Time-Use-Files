# What Is Anthropology?

![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Anthropology,** by definition, is a discipline of infinite curiosity about human beings. The term comes from the Greek *anthropos* for "man, human" and logos for "study." Anthropologists seek answers to an enormous variety of questions about humans. They are interested in discovering when, where, and why humans appeared on the earth, how and why they have changed since then, and how and why modern human populations vary in certain physical features. Anthropologists are also interested in how and why societies in the past and present have varied in their customary ideas and practices.

But a definition of anthropology as the study of human beings is not complete, for according to such a definition anthropology would appear to incorporate a whole catalog of disciplines: sociology, psychology, political science, economics, history, human biology, and perhaps even the humanistic disciplines of philosophy and literature. Needless to say, practitioners of the many other disciplines concerned with humans would not be happy to be regarded as being in subbranches of anthropology. After all, most of those disciplines have existed longer than anthropology, and each is somewhat distinctive. There must, then, be something unique about anthropology-a reason for

its having developed as a separate discipline and for its having retained a separate identity over the last 100 years.

# THE SCOPE OF ANTHROPOLOGY

Anthropologists are generally thought of as individuals who travel to little-known corners of the world to study exotic peoples or who dig deep into the earth to uncover the fossil remains or the tools and pots of people who lived long ago. These views, though clearly stereotyped, do indicate how anthropology differs from other disciplines concerned with humans: anthropology is broader in scope (both geographically and historically.) Anthropology is concerned explicitly and directly with all varieties of people throughout the world, not only those close at hand or within a limited area. It is also interested in people of all periods. Beginning with the immediate ancestors of humans, who lived a few million years ago, anthropology traces the development of humans until the present. Every part of the world that has ever contained a human population is of interest to anthropologists.

#### FIGURE 1–1

The four major subdisciplines of anthropology (in bold letters) may be classified according to subject matter (physical or cultural) and according to the period with which each is concerned (distant past versus recent past and present). There are applications of anthropology in all four subdisciplines.

Anthropologists have not always been as broad and comprehensive in their concerns as they are today. Traditionally, they concentrated on non-Western cultures and left the study of Western civilization and similarly complex societies, with their recorded histories, to other disciplines. In recent years, however, this general division of labor among the disciplines has begun to disappear. Now anthropologists can be found at work in cities of the industrial world as well as in remote villages of the non-Western world.

What induces anthropologists to choose so broad a subject for study? In part, they are motivated by the belief that any suggested generalization about human beings, any possible explanation of some characteristic of human culture or biology, should be shown to apply to many times and places of human existence. If a generalization or explanation does not prove to apply widely, we are entitled or even obliged to be skeptical about it. The skeptical attitude, in the absence of persuasive evidence, is our best protection against accepting invalid ideas about humans.

For example, when American educators discovered in the 1960s that black schoolchildren rarely drank milk, they assumed that lack of money or education was the cause. But evidence from anthropology suggested a different explanation. Anthropologists had known for years that in many parts of the world where milking animals are kept, people do not drink fresh milk; rather, they sour it before they drink it, or they make it into cheese. Why they do so is now clear. Many people lack an enzyme, lactase, that is necessary for breaking down lactose, the sugar in milk. When such people drink regular milk it actually interferes with digestion—not only is the lactose in milk not digested, but other nutrients are less likely to be digested as well. In many cases, drinking milk will cause cramps, stomach gas, diarrhea, and nausea. Studies indicate that milk intolerance is found in many parts of the world.<sup> $1$ </sup> The condition is common in adulthood among Asians, southern Europeans, Arabs and Jews, West Africans, Inuit (Eskimos), and North and South American Indians, as well as American blacks! Because anthropologists are acquainted with human life in an enormous variety of geographical and historical settings, they are often able to correct mistaken beliefs about different groups of people.

# THE HOLISTIC APPROACH

In addition to the worldwide as well as historical scope of anthropology, another distinguishing feature of the discipline is its **holistic**, or multifaceted, approach to the study of human beings. Anthropologists study not only all varieties of people but many aspects of human experience as well. For example, when describing a group of people, an anthropologist might discuss the history of the area in which the people live, the physical environment, the organization of family life, the general features of their language, the group's settlement patterns, political and economic systems, religion, and styles of art and dress.

In the past, individual anthropologists tried to be holistic and cover all aspects of a subject. Today, as in many other disciplines, so much information has been accumulated that anthropologists tend to specialize in one topic or area. Thus, one anthropologist may investigate the physical characteristics of some of our prehistoric ancestors. Another may study the biological effect of the environment on a human population over time. Still another will concentrate on the customs of a particular group of people. Despite this specialization, however, the discipline of anthropology retains its holistic orientation in that its many different specialties, taken together, describe many aspects of human existence, both past and present, on all levels of complexity.

## THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL CURIOSITY

Thus far we have described anthropology as being broader in scope, both historically and geographically, and more holistic in approach than other disciplines concerned with human beings. But this statement again implies that anthropology is the allinclusive human science. How, then, is anthropology really different from those other disciplines? We suggest that anthropology's distinctiveness lies principally in the kind of curiosity it arouses.

Anthropologists are concerned with many types of questions: Where, when, and why did people first begin living in cities? Why do some peoples have darker skin than others? Why do some languages contain more color terms than other languages? Why, in some societies, are men allowed to be married to several women simultaneously? Although these questions deal with very different aspects of human existence, they have at least one thing in common: they all deal with typical characteristics of particular populations. The typical characteristic of a people might be relatively dark skin, a language having many color terms, or the practice of having several wives. This concern with typical characteristics (traits, customs) of populations is perhaps the most distinguishing feature of anthropology. For example, whereas economists take our monetary system for granted and study how it operates, anthropologists ask why *only* some societies during the last few thousand years used money. In short, anthropologists are curious about the typical characteristics of human populations—how and why such populations and their characteristics have varied—throughout the ages.

# FIELDS OF ANTHROPOLOGY

Different anthropologists concentrate on different typical characteristics of societies. Some are concerned primarily with biological or physical characteristics of human populations; others are interested principally in what we call cultural characteristics. Hence, there are two broad classifications of subject matter in anthropology: **physical** (biological) anthropology and cultural anthropology. Physical anthropology is one major field of anthropology. Cultural anthropology is divided into three major subfields-archeology, linguistics, and ethnology. Ethnology, the study of recent cultures, is often referred to by the parent name, cultural anthropology.

### Physical Anthropology

Physical anthropology seeks to answer two distinct sets of questions. The first set includes questions about the emergence of humans and their later evolution (this is the focus called **human paleontology** 

Paleontologist Richard Leakey holding fossilized skull of early human

![](_page_3_Picture_6.jpeg)

or **paleoanthropology**). The second set includes questions about how and why contemporary human populations vary biologically (the focus referred to as **human variation**).

In order to reconstruct human evolution, human paleontologists search for and study the buried, hardened remains or impressions-known as fossils-of humans, prehumans, and related animals. Paleontologists working in East Africa, for instance, have excavated the fossil remains of humanlike beings who lived more than 3 million years ago. These findings have suggested the approximate dates when our ancestors began to develop two-legged walking, very flexible hands, and a larger brain.

In attempting to clarify evolutionary relationships, human paleontologists may use not only the fossil record but also geological information on the succession of climates, environments, and plant and animal populations. Moreover, when reconstructing the past of humans, paleontologists are also interested in the behavior and evolution of our closest relatives among the mammals—the prosimians, monkeys, and apes, which, like ourselves, are members of the order of Primates. (Anthropologists, psychologists, and biologists who specialize in the study of primates are called **primatologists**.) Species of primates are observed in the wild and in the laboratory. One especially popular subject of study is the chimpanzee, which bears a close resemblance to humans in behavior and physical appearance, has a similar blood chemistry, and is susceptible to many of the same diseases.

From primate studies, physical anthropologists try to discover characteristics that are distinctly human, as opposed to those that might be part of the primate heritage. With this information, they may be able to infer what our prehistoric ancestors were like. The inferences from primate studies are checked against the fossil record. The evidence from the earth, collected in bits and pieces, is correlated with scientific observations of our closest living relatives.

In short, physical anthropologists piece together bits of information obtained from different sources. They construct theories that explain the changes observed in the fossil record and then attempt to evaluate their theories by checking one kind of evidence against another. Human paleontology thus overlaps a great deal with disciplines such as geology, general vertebrate (and particularly primate) paleontology, comparative anatomy, and the study of comparative primate behavior.

The second major focus of physical anthropology-the study of human variation-investigates how and why contemporary human populations differ in physical or biological characteristics. All living people belong to one species, *Homo sapiens*, for all can successfully interbreed. Yet there is much that varies among human populations. The investigators of human variation ask such questions as these: Why are some peoples taller than others? How have human populations adapted physically to their environmental conditions? Are some peoples, such as Inuit (Eskimos), better equipped than other peoples to endure cold? Does darker skin pigmentation offer special protection against the tropical sun?

To better understand the biological variations observable among contemporary human populations, physical anthropologists use the principles, concepts, and techniques of (at least) three other disciplines: human genetics (the study of human traits that are inherited), population biology (the study of environmental effects on, and interaction with, population characteristics), and epidemiology (the study of how and why diseases affect different populations in different ways). Research on human variation, therefore, overlaps with research in other fields. Persons who consider themselves physical anthropologists, however, are concerned most with human populations and how they vary biologically.

## **Cultural Anthropology**

To an anthropologist, the term **culture** generally refers to the customary ways of thinking and behaving of a particular population or society. The culture of a social group, therefore, is composed of its language, general knowledge, religious beliefs, food preferences, music, work habits, taboos, and so forth. Archaeology (the study of past cultures through their material remains), anthropological **linguistics** (the anthropological study of languages), and ethnology (the study of existing and recent cultures), the subdisciplines we consider next, are all directly concerned with human culture. Thus, they can be grouped under the broad classification of cultural anthropology.

Archaeology. The archaeologist seeks not only to reconstruct the daily life and customs of peoples who lived in the past but also to trace cultural changes and to offer possible explanations of those changes. This concern is similar to that of the historian, but the archaeologist reaches much farther back in time. The historian deals only with societies that left written records and is therefore limited to the last 5,000 years of human history. Human societies, however, have existed for more than a million years, and only a small proportion in the last 5,000 years did not have writing. For all those past societies lacking a written record, the archaeologist serves as historian. Lacking written records for study, archaeologists must try to reconstruct history from the remains of human cultures. Some of these remains are as grand as the Mayan temples discovered at Chichén Itzá in Yucatán, Mexico. More often they are as ordinary as bits of broken pottery, stone tools, and garbage heaps.

Most archaeologists deal with **prehistory**, the time before written records. But there is a specialty within archaeology, called historical archaeology, that studies the remains of recent peoples who left written records. This specialty, as its name implies, employs the methods of archaeologists *and* the methods of historians to study recent societies for which we have both archaeological and historical information.

In trying to understand how and why ways of life have changed through time in different parts of the world, archaeologists collect materials from sites of human occupation. Usually, these sites must be unearthed. On the basis of materials they have excavated and otherwise collected, they then ask various questions: Where, when, and why did the distinctive human characteristic of toolmaking first emerge? Where, when, and why did agriculture first

#### RESEARCHER AT WORK: ELIZABETH M. BRUMFIEL

Now professor of anthropology at Albion College, Elizabeth Brumfiel became interested in the origins of social inequality when she was just an undergraduate. Archaeologists had known for some time that substantial wealth differences between families developed only recently (archaeologically speaking), that is, only after about 6,000 years ago. The archaeological indicators of inequality are fairly clearelaborate burials with valuable goods for some families and large differences in houses and possessions. But why the transformation occurred was not so clear. When she was in graduate school at the University of Michigan, Brumfiel says, she didn't accept the then-current explanation—that inequality provided benefits to the society (for example, the standard of living of most people improved as the leaders got richer). So, for her Ph.D. research in central Mexico, she began to test the "benefit" explanation in an area that had been independent politically at first and then became part of the

Aztec empire. She studied the surface material remains in the area and historical documents written by Europeans and Aztec nobility. Her findings contradicted the benefit explanation of social inequality; she found little improvement in the standard of living of the local people after the Aztec empire had absorbed them.

Another important part of her research agenda is understanding the lives of women. How were they affected by the expansion of the Aztec empire? Did their work change? How were women portrayed in art? In the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, images of militarism and masculinity became increasingly important with the growth of the empire, and sculptures showed

women in subordinate positions (for example, kneeling). But the images of women in the area of Brumfiel's fieldwork did not change. For example, most of the sculptures after the Aztecs had taken over still showed women standing, not kneeling.

Like many anthropologists, Brumfiel asked herself how she could contribute to the community in which she did her fieldwork. She decided to design an exhibit to display the successes of the people who had lived in the area for 1,200 years. That exhibit is now finished and open.

As she continues to explore issues about the origins of inequality and the position of women, she is quite comfortable with knowing that someone will think that she has "gotten it wrong, and will set out on a lifetime of archaeological research to find her own answers."

develop? Where, when, and why did people first begin to live in cities?

To collect the data they need in order to suggest answers to these and other questions, archaeologists use techniques and findings borrowed from other disciplines as well as what they can infer from anthropological studies of recent and contemporary cultures. For example, to guess where to dig for evidence of early toolmaking, archaeologists rely on geology to tell them where sites of early human occupation are likely (because of erosion and uplifting) to be found near the existing surface of the earth. (The evidence available today indicates that the earliest toolmakers lived in East Africa.) To infer when agriculture first developed, archaeologists date the relevant excavated materials by a process originally developed by chemists. And to try to understand why cities first emerged, archaeologists may need information from historians, geographers, and others about how recent and contemporary cities are related economically and politically to their hinterlands. If we can discover what recent and contemporary cities have in common, perhaps we can speculate on why cities developed originally. Archaeologists can then test those speculations. Thus, archaeologists may use information from the present and recent past in trying to understand the distant past.

Anthropological Linguistics. A second branch of cultural anthropology is linguistics, the study of languages. As a science, the study of languages is somewhat older than anthropology. The two disciplines became closely associated in the early days of anthropological fieldwork, when anthropologists enlisted the help of linguists to study unwritten languages. In contrast with other linguists, then, anthropological linguists are interested primarily in the history and structure of formerly unwritten languages.

Like physical anthropologists, linguists study changes that have taken place over time and contemporary variation. Some anthropological linguists are concerned with the emergence of language and also with the divergence of languages over thousands of years. The study of how languages change over time and how they may be related is known as historical linguistics. Anthropological linguists are also interested in how contemporary languages differespecially in the way they differ in construction. This focus of linguistics is generally called structural (or **descriptive**) **linguistics.** The study of how language is used in social contexts is called sociolinguistics.

In contrast with the human paleontologist and archaeologist, who have physical remains to help them reconstruct change over time, the historical linguist is dealing only with languages-and usually unwritten ones at that. (Remember that writing is only about 5,000 years old, and most languages since then have not been written.) Because an unwritten language must be heard in order to be studied, it does not leave any traces once its speakers have died. Linguists interested in reconstructing the history of unwritten languages must begin in the present, with comparisons of contemporary languages. On the basis of these comparisons, they draw inferences about the kinds of change in language that may have occurred in the past and that may account for similarities and differences observed in the present. The historical linguist typically asks such questions as these: Did two or more contemporary languages diverge from a common ancestral language? If they are related, how far back in time did they begin to differ?

Unlike the historical linguist, the descriptive (or structural) linguist is typically concerned with discovering and recording the principles that determine how sounds and words are put together in speech. For example, a structural description of a particular language might tell us that the sounds  $t$ and  $k$  are interchangeable in a word without causing a difference in meaning. In the islands of American Samoa, one could say Tutuila or Kukuila as the name of the largest island and everyone, except perhaps the visiting anthropologist, would understand that the same island was being mentioned.

The sociolinguist is interested in the social aspects of language, including what people speak about and how they interact conversationally, their attitudes toward speakers of other dialects or languages, and how people speak differently in different social contexts. In English, for example, we do not address everyone we meet in the same way. "Hi, Sandy" may be the customary way a person greets a friend. But we would probably feel uncomfortable addressing a doctor by first name; instead we would probably say, "Good morning, Dr. Brown." Such variations in language use, which are determined by the social status of the persons being addressed, are significant for the sociolinguist.

*Ethnology.* Ethnologists seek to understand how and why peoples today and in the recent past differ in their customary ways of thinking and acting. Ethnology, then, is concerned with patterns of thought and behavior, such as marriage customs, kinship organization, political and economic systems, religion, folk art, and music, and with the ways in which these patterns differ in contemporary societies. Ethnologists

## RESEARCHER AT WORK: TERENCE E. HAYS

Books and articles often report research in a straightforward manner. Here's the problem; here's the answer-that kind of thing. But many researchers know from experience that knowledge does not always come in a straightforward manner. Now a professor at Rhode Island College, Terence Hays has reflected on the twists and turns in his fieldwork among the Ndumba in the Eastern Highlands Province of Papua New Guinea. He first started out studying whether different types of people (for example, women and men) had different types of plant knowledge and whether they classified plants differently.

also study the dynamics of culture—that is, how various cultures develop and change. In addition, they are interested in the relationship between beliefs and practices within a culture. Thus, the aim of ethnologists is largely the same as that of archaeologists. Ethnologists, however, generally use data collected through observation and interviewing of living peoples. Archaeologists, on the other hand, must work with fragmentary remains of past cultures, on the basis of which they can only make inferences about the customs of prehistoric peoples.

One type of ethnologist, the ethnographer, usually spends a year or so living with, talking to, and observing the people whose customs he or she is studying. This fieldwork provides the data for a detailed description (an ethnography) of many aspects of the customary behavior and thought of those people. The ethnographer not only tries to describe the general patterns of their life but also may suggest answers to such questions as: How are economic and political behavior related? How may the customs of people be adapted to environ-

mental conditions? Is there any relationship between beliefs about the supernatural and beliefs or practices about the natural world? In other words, the ethnographer depicts the way of life of a particular group of people and may also suggest explanations for some of the customs observed.

Because so many cultures have undergone extensive change in the recent past, it is fortunate that another type of ethnologist, the ethnohistorian, is prepared to study how the ways of life of a particular group of people have changed over time. Ethnohistorians investigate written documents (which may or may not have been produced by anthropologists). They may spend many years going through documents, such as missionary accounts, reports by traders and explorers, and government records, to try to establish the cultural changes that have occurred. Unlike ethnographers, who rely mostly on their own observations, ethnohistorians rely on the reports of others. Often, they must attempt to piece together and make sense of widely scattered, and even apparently contradictory, infor-

associating with women.

His curiosity was aroused about these ceremonies and myths. How important are myths in perpetuating cultural themes? Do other societies that have separate men's houses have similar myths?

He realized when he returned home from the field that many societies have similar stories. Are these generally linked to initiation rites and to physical segregation of the sexes? Answering these questions required comparison, so he embarked on collecting myths and folktales from colleagues who worked in other New Guinea highland societies. In the course of collecting these comparative materials, he realized he didn't have all the ethnographic information he needed. So he went back to the field to get it. As Hays remarked, "As an ethnographer I was continually faced with the question, . . . How do you know it's true? But even when I could reach a (hard-won) conviction that something was true for the Ndumba, the second question awaited: How do you know it's generally true, which you can't know without comparison?"

mation. Thus, the ethnohistorian's research is very much like that of the historian, except that the ethnohistorian is usually concerned with the history of a people who did not themselves leave written records. The ethnohistorian tries to reconstruct the recent history of a people and may also suggest why certain changes in their way of life took place.

With the data collected and analyzed by the ethnographer and ethnohistorian, the work of a third type of ethnologist, the cross-cultural researcher, can be done. The cross-cultural researcher is interested in discovering why certain cultural characteristics may be found in some societies but not in others. Why, for example, do some societies have plural marriages (one spouse of one sex and two or more spouses of the other sex), circumcision of adolescent boys, or belief in a high god or supreme being? In testing possible answers to such questions, cross-cultural researchers use data from samples of cultures to try to arrive at general explanations of cultural variation.

Because ethnologists may be interested in many aspects of customary behavior and thought, from economic behavior to political behavior to styles of art, music, and religion, ethnology overlaps with disciplines that concentrate on some particular aspect of human existence, such as sociology, psychology, economics, political science, art, music, and comparative religion. But the distinctive feature of cultural anthropology is its interest in how all these aspects of human existence vary from society to society, in all historical periods and in all parts of the world.

#### Specialization

As disciplines grow, they tend to develop more and more specialities. This trend is probably inevitable because as knowledge accumulates and methods become more advanced there is a limit to what any one person can reasonably keep track of. So, in addition to the general divisions we have outlined already, particular anthropologists tend to identify themselves with a variety of specializations. It is common for anthropologists to have a geographical specialty, which may be as broad as Old World or New World or as narrow as the southwestern United States. And those who study the past (archaeologists or human paleontologists) may also specialize in different time periods. Ethnologists often specialize in more specific subject matters in addition to one or two cultural areas. Just as most of the chapters in this book refer to broad subject specialties, so are there ethnologists who identify themselves as economic anthropologists, or political anthropologists, or psychological anthropologists. Others may identify themselves by theoretical orientations (which we discuss more fully in the chapter on schools of thought), such as cultural ecologists, who are concerned with the relationship between culture and the physical and social environment. These specialities are not mutually exclusive. A cultural ecologist, for example, might be interested in effects of the environment on economic behavior, or political behavior, or how people bring up their children.

Does specialization isolate an anthropologist from other kinds of research? Not necessarily. Some specialties have to draw on information from several fields, inside and outside anthropology. For example, medical anthropologists study human health and illness, so they need to understand the cultural context in which people spend their lives (especially their economy, diet, patterns of social interaction) and their attitudes and beliefs regarding illness and health as well as the biological aspects of the situation (which may require understanding human variation and the genetics of the population). There are many anthropologists who believe that important insights come from other fields and who regularly seek out possible connections with them.

### Applied Anthropology

As we will discuss more fully in the chapter on applied anthropology and social problems, there are people from each of the four major subdisciplines of anthropology who apply anthropological knowledge to achieve practical goals, usually in the service of an agency outside the traditional academic setting. Physical anthropologists may be called upon to give forensic evidence in court, or they may work in public health or in the design of clothes and equipment to fit human anatomy. Archaeologists may be involved in preserving and exhibiting artifacts for museums and in doing contract work to find and preserve cultural sites that might be damaged by construction or excavation. Linguists may work in educational (bilingual or multilingual) training programs. Ethnologists work in a wide variety of applied projects ranging from community development, health care, and agricultural improvement to personnel and organizational management and assessment of the impact of change programs on people's lives.<sup>2</sup> Because applied anthropology puts anthropological knowledge to use, basic understanding of humans and their cultures is essential to the enterprise.

# THE USEFULNESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY

For many centuries, the idea of traveling to the moon was only a dream. Yet in 1969 the dream became a reality when a U.S. Air Force officer gingerly planted his space boot in the moon dust. As the moon shot demonstrates, we know a great deal about the laws of nature in the physical world. If we did not understand so much, the technological achievements we are so proud of would not be possible.

In comparison, we know little about people, about how and why they behave as they do. When we consider the great number of social problems facing us, the importance and relevance of continuing research in cultural anthropology and the other social sciences become evident. Because social problems such as violence in the streets and wars between nations are products of human behavior, we need to find out what conditions produce those problems. Once we gain such understanding, we may be able to change the conditions and so reduce or even solve the problems.

That anthropology and other sciences dealing with humans began to develop only relatively recently is not in itself a sufficient reason for our knowing so little. Why, in our quest for knowledge of all kinds, did we wait so long to study ourselves? Leslie White suggested that in the history of science those phenomena most remote from us and least significant as determinants of human behavior were the first to be studied. The reason, he thought, is that humans like to think of themselves as citadels of free will, subject to no laws of nature. Hence there is no need to see ourselves as objects to be explained.<sup>3</sup>

The belief that it is impossible to account for human behavior scientifically, either because our actions and beliefs are too individualistic and complex or because human beings are understandable only in otherworldly terms, is a self-fulfilling idea. We cannot discover principles explaining human behavior if we neither believe there are such principles nor bother to look for them. The result is assured from the beginning: persons who do not believe in principles of human behavior will be reinforced by their finding none. If we are to increase our understanding of human beings, we first have to believe it is possible to do so.

Anthropology is useful, then, to the degree that it contributes to our understanding of human beings. In addition, it is useful because it helps us avoid misunderstandings between peoples. If we can understand why other groups are different from ourselves, we might have less reason to condemn them for behavior that appears strange to us. We may then come to realize that many differences among peoples are products of physical and cultural adaptations to different environments.

For example, someone who first finds out about the !Kung<sup>4</sup> as they lived in the Kalahari Desert of southern Africa in the 1950s might think that the !Kung were savages. The !Kung wore little clothing, had few possessions, lived in meager shelters, and enjoyed none of our technological niceties. But let us reflect on how a typical North American community might react if it awoke to find itself in an environment similar to that in which the !Kung lived. The people would find that the arid land makes both agriculture and animal husbandry impossible, and they might have to think about adopting a nomadic existence. They might then discard many of their material possessions so that they could travel easily, in order to take advantage of changing water and wild food supplies. Because of the extreme heat and the lack of extra water for laundry, they might find it more practical to be almost naked than to wear clothes. They would undoubtedly find it impossible to build elaborate homes. For social security, they might start to share the food brought into the group. Thus, if they survived at all, they might end up looking and acting far more like the !Kung looked than like typical North Americans.

Physical differences, too, may be seen as results of adaptations to the environment. For example, in our society we admire people who are tall and slim. If these same individuals were forced to live above the Arctic Circle, however, they might wish they could trade their tall, slim bodies for short, compact ones, because stocky physiques appear to conserve body heat more effectively and may therefore be more adaptive in cold climates.

Exposure to anthropology might help to alleviate some of the misunderstandings that arise between people of different cultural groups from subtle causes operating below the level of consciousness. For example, different cultures have different conceptions of the gestures and interpersonal distances that are appropriate under various circumstances. Arabs consider it proper to stand close

Foragers such as the !Kung pictured here have to change their campsites to collect wild resources through the year. They cannot carry much with them, and the short time they spend in a particular site does not encourage the building of permanent housing.

Tourism is one way to learn about other cultures, as here in Asmat country of western New *Guinea. But anthropology is a better way. It tells us not just how cultures are different, but helps* us to understand why.

enough to other people to smell them.<sup>5</sup> On the basis of the popularity of deodorants in our culture, we can deduce that Americans prefer to keep the olfactory dimension out of interpersonal relations. We may feel that a person who comes too close is being too intimate. We should remember, however, that this person may only be acting according to a culturally conditioned conception of what is proper in a given situation. If our intolerance for others results in part from a lack of understanding of why peoples vary, then the knowledge accumulated by anthropologists may help lessen that intolerance.

Knowledge of our past may also bring both a feeling of humility and a sense of accomplishment. If we are to attempt to deal with the problems of our world, we must be aware of our vulnerability so that we do not think that the problems will solve themselves. But we also have to think enough of our accomplishments to believe that we can find solutions to our problems.

Much of the trouble people get themselves into may be a result of their feelings of self-importance and invulnerability—in short, their lack of humility. Knowing something about our evolutionary past may help us to understand and accept our place in the biological world. Just as for any other form of life, there is no guarantee that any particular human pop-

ulation, or even the entire human species, will perpetuate itself indefinitely. The earth changes, the environment changes, and humanity itself changes; what survives and flourishes in the present might not do so in the future.

Yet our vulnerability should not make us feel powerless. There are many reasons to feel confident about the future. Consider what we have accomplished so far. By means of tools and weapons fashioned from sticks and stones, we were able to hunt animals larger and more powerful than ourselves. We discovered how to make fire, and we learned to use it to keep ourselves warm and to cook our food. As we domesticated plants and animals, we gained greater control over our food supply and were able to establish more permanent settlements. We mined and smelted ores to fashion more durable tools. We built cities and irrigation systems, monuments and ships. We made it possible to travel from one continent to another in a single day. We conquered various illnesses and prolonged human life.

In short, human beings and their cultures have changed considerably over the course of history. Human populations have often been able to adapt to changing circumstances. Let us hope that humans continue to adapt to the challenges of the present and the future.

1. Anthropology is literally the study of human beings. It differs from other disciplines concerned with people in that it is broader in scope. It is concerned with humans in all places of the world (not simply those places close to us), and it traces human evolution and cultural development from millions of years ago to the present day.

2. Another distinguishing feature of anthropology is its holistic approach to the study of human beings. Anthropologists study not only all varieties of people but also all aspects of those peoples' experiences.

3. Anthropologists are concerned with identifying and explaining typical characteristics (traits, customs) of particular human populations.

4. Physical anthropology is one of the major fields of the discipline. Physical anthropology studies the emergence of humans and their later physical evolution (the focus called human paleontology). It also studies how and why contemporary human populations vary biologically (the focus called human variation).

5. The second broad area of concern to anthropology is cultural anthropology. Its three subfields-archaeology, anthropological linguistics, and ethnology—all deal with aspects of human culture—that is, with the customary ways of thinking and behaving of a particular society.

6. Archaeologists seek not only to reconstruct the daily life and customs of prehistoric peoples but also to trace cultural changes and offer possible explanations of those changes. Therefore, archaeologists try to reconstruct history from the remains of human cultures.

7. Anthropological linguists are concerned with the emergence of language and with the divergence of languages over time (a subject known as historical linguistics). They also study how contemporary languages differ, both in construction (structural or descriptive linguistics) and in use in actual speech (sociolinguistics).

8. The ethnologist seeks to understand how and why peoples of today and the recent past differ in their customary ways of thinking and acting. One type of ethnologist, the ethnographer, usually spends a year or so living with and talking to a particular population and observing their customs. Later, she or he may prepare a detailed report of the group's behavior, which is called an ethnography. Another type of ethnologist, the ethnohistorian, investigates written documents to determine how the ways of life of a particular group of people have changed over time. A third type of ethnologist-the cross-cultural researcher-studies data collected by ethnographers and ethnohistorians for a sample of cultures and attempts to discover which explanations of particular customs may be generally applicable.

9. In all four major subdisciplines of anthropology, there are applied anthropologists, people who apply anthropological knowledge to achieve more practical goals, usually in the service of an agency outside the traditional academic setting.

10. Anthropology may help people to be more tolerant. Anthropological studies can show us why other people are the way they are, both culturally and physically. Customs or actions that appear improper or offensive to us may be adaptations to particular environmental and social conditions.

11. Anthropology is also valuable in that knowledge of our past may bring us both a feeling of humility and a sense of accomplishment. Like any other form of life, we have no guarantee that any particular human population will perpetuate itself indefinitely. Yet knowledge of our achievements in the past may give us confidence in our ability to solve the problems of the future.
