# Social Stratification

![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg)

A long-enduring value in the United States is the belief that "all men are created equal." These famous words from our Declaration of Independence do not mean that all people are equal in wealth or status, but rather that all (including women nowadays) are supposed to be equal before the law. In fact, modern industrial societies such as our own are socially stratified—that is, they contain social groups that have unequal access to important advantages, such as economic resources, power, and prestige.

Many sociologists say that all societies are stratified; anthropologists disagree. But the disagreement is really a matter of definition, because sociologists and anthropologists do not usually mean the same thing by the term stratification. When sociologists speak of the "universality of stratification," they mean that all societies show some inequality from one *individual* to another. The sociological definition of stratification derives from the observation that in even the simplest societies there are usually some differences in advantages based on age or ability or gender: adults have higher status than children, the skilled more than

the unskilled, men more than women. (We discuss sexual or "gender" stratification in the next chapter.) When anthropologists say that stratification is not universal and that egalitarian societies exist, they mean that there are some societies in which all social groups (for example, families) have more or less the same access or right to advantages. It is not a question of deciding whether sociologists or anthropologists are correct: both are. For anthropologists, then, human inequality may be universal; social stratification is not.

Systems of social stratification are strongly linked to the customary ways in which economic resources are allocated, distributed, and converted through labor into goods and services. So we would not expect substantial inequality if all people had relatively equal access to economic resources. But stratification cannot be understood solely in terms of economic resources—there are other benefits (such as prestige and power) that may be unequally distributed. After examining how societies vary in their systems of stratification, we will turn to possible explanations of why they vary.

Sharing can occur even in a socially stratified society. Here we see men in a village in Yunnan, China, cutting the meat from a steer into 72 portions for the families of the village.

# VARIATION IN DEGREE OF SOCIAL INEQUALITY

Societies vary in the extent to which social groups (as well as individuals) have unequal access to advantages. In this chapter we are concerned with differential or unequal access to three types of advantages: wealth or economic resources, power, and prestige. As we saw in the preceding chapter, resources may range from hunting or fishing grounds to farmland to money; the different social groups in a society may or may not have unequal access to these resources. Power is a second but related advantage. It is the ability to make others do what they do not want to do; power is influence based on the threat of force. When groups in a society have rules or customs that give them unequal access to wealth or resources, they generally also have unequal access to power. So, for example, when we speak of a "company town" in the United States, we are referring to the fact that the company that employs most of the residents of the town usually has considerable control over them. Finally, there is the advantage of prestige. When we speak of prestige we mean that someone or some group is accorded particular respect or honor. Even if it is true that there is always unequal access by individuals to prestige (because of differences in age, gender, or ability), there are some societies in the ethnographic record that have no social groups with unequal access to prestige.

Thus, anthropologists conventionally distinguish three types of society in terms of the degree to which different social groups have unequal access to advantages: egalitarian, rank, and class societies. Some societies in the ethnographic record do not fit easily into any of these three types; as with any classification scheme, some cases seem to straddle the line between types.<sup>1</sup> But most societies are conventionally classified as belonging to just one of the three types summarized in Table 8-1. Egalitarian societies contain no social groups with greater or lesser access to economic resources, power, or prestige. Rank societies do not have unequal access to economic resources or to power, but they do contain social groups with unequal access to prestige. Rank societies, then, are partially stratified. Class societies have unequal access to all three advantages-economic resources, power, and prestige.

# EGALITARIAN SOCIETIES

Egalitarian societies can be found not only among foragers but also among horticulturalists and pastoralists. An important point to keep in mind is that egalitarian does not mean that all people within such societies are the same. There will always be differences among individuals in age and gender and in such abilities or traits as hunting skill, perception, health, creativity, physical prowess, attractiveness, and intelligence. According to Morton Fried, egali*tarian* means that within a given society "there are as many positions of prestige in any given age/sex grade as there are persons capable of filling them."2 For instance, if a person can achieve high status by fashioning fine spears, and if every person in the society fashions such spears, then every person acquires high status as a spear maker. If high status is also acquired by carving bones into artifacts, and if only three people are considered expert carvers of bones, then only those three achieve high status as carvers. But the next generation might produce eight spear makers and twenty carvers. In an egalitarian society, the number of prestigious positions is adjusted to fit the number of qualified candidates. We would say, therefore, that such a society is not socially stratified.

There are, of course, differences in position and prestige arising out of differences in ability. Even in an egalitarian society, differential prestige exists.

But, although some persons may be better hunters or more skilled artists than others, there is still equal ac*cess* to status positions for people of the same ability. Any prestige gained by achievement of high status as a great hunter, for instance, is neither transferable nor inheritable. Because a man is a great hunter, it is not assumed that his sons are also great hunters. There may also be individuals with more influence, but it is not bequeathable, and there are no groups with appreciably more influence over time. An egalitarian society keeps inequality at a minimal level.

Any differences in prestige that do exist are not related to economic differences. Egalitarian groups depend heavily on sharing, which ensures equal access to economic resources despite differences in acquired prestige. For instance, in some egalitarian communities, some members achieve higher status through hunting. But even before the hunt begins, how the animal will be divided and distributed among the members of the band has already been decided according to custom. The culture works to separate the status achieved by members-recognition as great hunters-from actual possession of the wealth, which in this case would be the slain animal.

Just as egalitarian societies do not have social groups with unequal access to economic resources, they also do not have social groups with unequal access to power. As we will see later in the chapter on political organization, unequal access to power by social groups seems to occur only in state societies, which have full-time political officials and marked differences in wealth.

The Mbuti Pygmies of central Africa provide an example of a society almost totally equal: "Neither in ritual, hunting, kinship nor band relations do they exhibit any discernable inequalities of rank or advantage."<sup>3</sup> Their hunting bands have no leaders; recognition of the achievement of one person is not accompanied by privilege of any sort. Economic resources such as food are communally shared, and even tools and weapons are frequently passed from person to person. Only within the family are rights and privileges differentiated.

# RANK SOCIETIES

Most societies with social ranking practice agriculture or herding, but not all agricultural or pastoral societies are ranked. Ranking is characterized by social groups with unequal access to prestige or status but not significantly unequal access to economic resources or power. Unequal access to prestige is

often reflected in the position of chief, a rank to which only some members of a specified group in the society can succeed.

In rank societies, the position of chief is at least partially hereditary. The criterion of superior rank in some Polynesian societies, for example, was genealogical. Usually the eldest son succeeded to the position of chief, and different kinship groups were differentially ranked according to their genealogical distance from the chiefly line.

In rank societies, chiefs are often treated with deference by people of lower rank. For example, among the Trobriand Islanders of Melanesia, people of lower rank must keep their heads lower than a person of higher rank. So, when a chief is standing, commoners must bend low. When commoners have to walk past a chief who happens to be sitting, he may rise and they will bend. If the chief chooses to remain seated, they must crawl.<sup>4</sup>

Chiefs may sometimes look as if they are substantially richer than commoners, for they may receive many gifts and have larger storehouses. In some instances, the chief may be called the "owner" of the land, but other people have the right to use the land. The chief may have bigger storehouses, but his stores may be only temporary accumulations for feasts or other redistributions. The chief in a rank society usually cannot make people give him gifts or work on communal projects. Often the chief can encourage production only by working furiously on his own cultivation.<sup>5</sup>

Unusual among rank societies were the nineteenth-century Native Americans who lived along the Northwest Coast.<sup>6</sup> They were unusual because their economy was based on food collecting. But huge catches of salmon—which were preserved for year-round consumption—enabled them to support fairly large and permanent communities. In many ways, the Northwest Coast societies were similar to food-producing societies, even in their development of social ranking. Still, the principal means of proving one's high status among the Northwest Coast Indians was to give wealth away. The tribal chiefs celebrated solemn rites by grand feasts (potlatches), at which they gave gifts to every guest.7

# CLASS SOCIETIES

In class societies, as in rank societies, there is unequal access to prestige. But unlike rank societies, class societies are characterized by groups that have substantially greater or lesser access to economic re-

sources and power. That is, not every social group has the same opportunity to obtain land, animals, money, or other economic benefits or the same opportunity to exercise power that other groups have. Fully stratified or class societies range from somewhat open to virtually closed class, or *caste*, systems.

### Open Class Systems

A **class** is a category of persons who all have about the same opportunity to obtain economic resources, power, and prestige. Different classes have differing opportunities. We call class systems open if there is some possibility of moving from one class to another. Since the 1920s, there have been innumerable studies of classes in North American towns and cities. Sociologists have produced profiles of these different communities-known variously as Yankee City, Middletown, Jonesville, and Old City-all of which support the premise that the United States has distinguishable, though somewhat open, social classes. Both W. Lloyd Warner and Paul Lunt's Yankee City study<sup>8</sup> and Robert and Helen Lynd's Middletown study<sup>9</sup> concluded that the social status or prestige of a family is generally correlated with the occupation and wealth of the head of the family.

The determinants of class status can change over time. For example, in 1776 the middle class in the United States consisted of the families of selfemployed craftspeople, shopkeepers, and farmers. By 1985, only about 8 percent of the population were self-employed, but many more people thought of themselves as belonging to the middle class. Selfemployment is now a less important determinant of middle class status than working with one's mind and having authority over others on the job.<sup>10</sup>

How open a class system is, how possible it is to move into a class that is different from the one you were born into, may vary over time. In Britain, it is estimated that only 16.5 percent of the population born before 1890 moved to a higher social class than their parents belonged to; for those born between 1930 and 1947, the percentage moving up was 30.5 percent. Most of this increase in mobility can be explained as the result of a declining number of semiskilled and skilled manual-labor jobs throughout the twentieth century, along with an increase in clerical and service jobs. In short, many workingclass individuals were able to move up to more middle-class jobs. But, although there was considerable mobility from working to middle class in Britain, there was much less mobility into the upper class. There was also some downward social mobility, al-

### THE WIDENING GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR IN THE UNITED STATES

In the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. economy expanded enormously. Many people grew up during those years assuming that things could only get better. Their parents may have lived through the Great Depression of the 1930s, but that kind of thing could never happen to them. They would have bigger incomes and bigger houses and live the American Dream. But from the mid-1970s through the early 1990s something went wrong. Anthropologist Katherine Newman spent two years interviewing ordinary people in a suburban town she calls "Pleasanton." Lauren's comments are typical: "I'll never have what my parents had. I can't even dream of that. . . . I worked all those years and then I didn't get to candyland." It is not that Lauren didn't follow the

![](_page_5_Figure_5.jpeg)

![](_page_5_Figure_6.jpeg)

rules. She worked hard to get good grades, she went to college, and she has a respectable job. Yet, even though both she and her husband work, they still cannot afford a house and they are not doing as well as her parents did on just one salary. Not only is housing more expensive. Jobs are less secure and harder to find,

and the credentials needed for those jobs are harder to achieve.

The squeeze on the people in the middle is only a small part of the economic picture. Not all segments of society did worse since the mid-1970s. While middle- and working-class people got poorer, the rich got richer. By the end of the 1980s, the richest 1 percent of all Americans owned over 36 percent of all the wealth (assets minus debts) in this country. The only time the very rich owned more was at the end of the 1920s, just before the Great Depression (see the graph). The same trend occurred in the distribution of incomethe wealthiest 20 percent of the

![](_page_6_Picture_0.jpeg)

population earned over 44 percent of all the income in 1991, which was the highest percentage since 1949.

As the graph shows, the degree of economic inequality has fluctuated throughout U.S. history, so the recent increase in inequality may not continue. Change over time in the degree of inequality sometimes has economic causes; the stock market crash in 1929 made the wealthy less wealthy. Some of the change over time is due to shifts in public policy. During the New Deal

![](_page_6_Picture_4.jpeg)

of the 1930s, tax changes and work programs shifted more income to ordinary people; in the 1980s, tax cuts for the wealthy helped the rich get richer.

Will the gap between rich and poor continue to widen? Only the future will tell. But whatever happens, political events—such as which interest groups can most influence Congress-are likely to be as crucial as the competitive position of the United States in the world economy.

Newman, Declining Fortunes: The Withering of the American Dream (New York: Basic Books, 1993), quotation from p. 3; Kevin Phillips, The Politics of Rich and Poor: Wealth and the American Electorate in the Reagan Aftermath (New York: Random House, 1990); U.S. Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1993, 113th ed.

though the rate of it declined over time. Downward mobility in Britain declined from 33 percent for those born before 1890 to 22 percent for those born between 1930 and 1947.<sup>11</sup>

How do the United States and Canada compare with other countries in degree of mobility? Among capitalist countries, Canada and Sweden have more mobility than the United States, France, and Britain. Japan and Italy have less mobility. If we focus on the ease of moving into the highest class, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, and Japan are more difficult than Britain and the United States.<sup>12</sup>

Degree of mobility, however, is not the same as degree of economic inequality. For example, Britain and the United States do not differ that much in rate of mobility, but they do differ considerably in the wealth of the rich compared with the poor. In 1989, the richest 1 percent in Britain held 18 percent of the wealth<sup>13</sup>; in the United States the comparable figure (at the end of the 1980s) was 36.3 percent (see the graph in the box titled "The Widening Gap between Rich and Poor in the United States"). The degree of inequality in Britain has declined enormously since the early 1900s: in  $1911-1913$ , the wealthiest 1 percent held 69 percent of the nation's wealth.<sup>14</sup>

Another way to calculate the disparity between rich and poor is to use the ratio of income held by the top fifth of the population divided by the income held by the bottom fifth. Comparatively speaking, the United States has the biggest discrepancy of any of the developed countries (see Figure  $8-1$ ), with a ratio of about 10 to 1; the top 20 percent of the population in this country controls ten times the wealth controlled by the bottom 20 percent. Among the developing countries, Brazil is the most unequal, with a ratio of 30 to 1, but the United States has more inequality than some of the developing countries, such as India, Ghana, Pakistan, and the Philippines.<sup>15</sup>

Obtaining more education, particularly a university education, is one of the most effective ways to move upward in contemporary societies. In fact, in many countries educational attainment predicts one's social class better than parent's occupation does.<sup>16</sup> Lower-class persons may become "resocialized" at the university. Resocialization separates them from their parents and enables them to gradually learn the skills, speech, attitudes, and manners characteristic of the higher class they wish to join. So successful is this process that students from a lower class who move into a higher class may find themselves ashamed to take their new friends to their parents' homes.

But obtaining more education, and particularly higher education, is not so easy. Your chances of doing so are affected by the class you are born into, as are many other aspects of our lives. People of different classes usually live in different neigh-

borhoods and go to different grade and secondary schools, and a person's ability to be accepted at a prestigious college might be affected by the grade and secondary schools attended. In addition, having money to spend on private schools and colleges may make it easier to go to the more prestigious schools, which are generally the more expensive schools. The schools we attend are not the only markers of class status. Our identification with a social class begins quite early in life. In addition to their differences in occupation and wealth, social classes vary in many other ways, including religious affiliation, closeness to kin, ideas about child rearing, job satisfaction, leisure-time activities, style of clothes and furniture, and (as we noted in the chapter on communication and language) even in styles of speech.<sup>17</sup>

Although one's adult class status is not fully determined at birth in open class societies, there is a high probability that most people will stay close to the class into which they were born and will marry within that class. That is, even if we do not inherit money from our parents, our chances of being successful are strongly influenced by our class background. The daughter of a wealthy business executive, for example, is likely to attend schools with good reputations. She will learn to speak with an accent that is more "elite." She will be likely to learn to ride horses, play tennis and the piano, and acquire the etiquette appropriate for attending concerts, parties, and teas. If she wants a career, she has a very good chance of getting into a college or graduate school of her choice, and she has social connections that can help her obtain a good starting position. If she gets married, she has a very good chance of marrying a man of similar background, tastes, and likelihood of success.

Class boundaries, though vague, have been established by custom and tradition; sometimes they have been reinforced by the enactment of laws. Many of our laws serve to protect property and thus tend to favor the upper and upper-middle classes. The poor, in contrast, seem to be perennial losers in our legal system. The crimes the poor are most likely to commit are dealt with quite harshly in our judicial system, and poor people rarely have the money to secure effective legal counsel.

Classes tend to perpetuate themselves through the bequeathing of wealth. John Brittain suggested that, in the United States, the transfer of money through bequests accounts for much of the wealth of the next generation. As we might expect, the importance of inheritance seems to increase at higher levels of wealth. That is, the wealth of richer people comes more from inheritance than does the wealth of not-so-rich people.<sup>18</sup>

#### **Caste Systems**

Some societies have classes that are virtually closed-these are called castes. A caste is a ranked group in which membership is determined at birth and marriage is restricted to members of one's own caste. So the only way you can belong is by being born into the group. And since you cannot marry outside the group, your children cannot acquire another caste status either. In India, for example, there are several thousand hereditary castes. Although the precise ranking of these thousands of groups is not completely clear, there appear to be four main levels of hierarchy, with the Brahmans at the top. The castes in India are often thought to be associated with different occupations, but that is not quite true. Most Indians live in rural areas and have agricultural occupations, but their castes vary a lot.<sup>19</sup>

Castes may exist in conjunction with a more open class system. Indeed, in India today, members of a low caste who can get wage-paying jobs (chiefly those in urban areas) may improve their social standing in the same ways available to people in other class societies. In general, however, they still cannot marry someone in a higher caste, so the caste system is perpetuated.

Questions basic to all stratified societies, and particularly to a caste society, were posed by John Ruskin, a nineteenth-century British essayist: "Which of us . . . is to do the hard and dirty work for the rest—and for what pay? Who is to do the pleasant and clean work, and for what pay?"20 Those questions have been answered in India by the caste system, which mainly dictates how goods and services are exchanged, particularly in rural areas.<sup>21</sup> Who is to do the hard and dirty work for the rest of society is clearly established: a large group of untouchables forms the bottom of the hierarchy. Among the untouchables are subcastes such as the Camars, or leatherworkers, and the Bhangis, who traditionally are sweepers. At the top of the hierarchy, performing the pleasant and clean work of priests, are the Brahmans. Between the two extremes are thousands of castes and subcastes. In a typical village, the potter makes clay drinking cups and larger water vessels for the entire village population. In return, the principal landowner gives him a house site and supplies him twice yearly with grain. Some other castes owe the potter their services: the

![](_page_9_Picture_0.jpeg)

barber cuts his hair; the sweeper carries away his rubbish; the washer washes his clothes; the Brahman performs his children's weddings. The barber serves every caste in the village except the untouchables; he, in turn, is served by half of the others. He has inherited the families he works for, along with his father's occupation. He also receives a house site from the principal landowner and, at each harvest, all the grain he can lift. All castes help at harvest and at weddings for additional payment, which sometimes includes a money payment.

This description is, in fact, an idealized picture of the caste system of India. In reality, the system operates to the advantage of the principal landowning caste-sometimes the Brahmans and sometimes other castes. Also, it is not carried on without some resentment; signs of hostility are shown toward the ruling caste by the untouchables and other lower castes. The resentment does not appear to be against the caste system as such. Instead, the lower castes exhibit bitterness at their own low status and strive for greater equality. For instance, one of the Camars' traditional services is to remove dead cattle; in return, they can have the meat to eat and the hide to tan for their leatherworking. Because handling dead animals and eating beef are both regarded as unclean acts, the Camars of one village refused to continue this service. Thus, they lost a source of free hides and food in a vain attempt to escape unclean status.

Since World War II, the economic basis of the caste system in India has been undermined somewhat by the growing practice of giving cash payment for services. For instance, the son of a barber may be a teacher during the week, earning a cash salary, and confine his haircutting to weekends. But he still remains in the barber caste (Nai) and must marry within that caste.

Perpetuation of the caste system is ensured by the power of those in the upper castes, who derive three main advantages from their position: economic gain, gain in prestige, and sexual gain. The economic gain is the most immediately apparent. An ample supply of cheap labor and free services is maintained by the threat of sanctions. Lower-caste members may have their use of a house site withdrawn; they may be refused access to the village well or to common grazing land for animals; or they may be expelled from the village. Prestige is also maintained by the threat of sanctions; the higher castes expect deference and servility from the lower castes. The sexual gain is less apparent but equally real. The high-caste male has access to two groups of females, those of his own caste and those of lower castes. High-caste females are kept free of the "contaminating" touch of low-caste males because low-caste males are allowed access only to low-caste women. Moreover, the constant reminders of ritual uncleanness serve to keep the lower castes "in their place." Higher castes do not accept water from untouchables, sit next to them, or eat at the same table with them.

Although few areas of the world have developed a caste system like that of India, there are castelike features in some other societies. For example, blacks in the United States used to have a castelike status determined partially by the inherited characteristic of skin color. Until recently, some states had laws prohibiting a black from marrying a white. Even when interracial marriage does occur, children of the union are often regarded as having lower status than white children, even though they may have blonde hair and light skin. In the South, where treatment of blacks as a caste was most apparent, whites traditionally refused to eat with blacks or to sit next to them at lunch counters, on buses, and in schools. Separate drinking fountains and toilets for blacks and whites reinforced the idea of ritual uncleanness. The economic advantages and gains in prestige enjoyed by whites are well documented.<sup>22</sup>

The traditional barriers between blacks and whites in the United States have mostly been lifted in recent years, but the "color line" has not disappeared. Blacks may be found now in all social classes, but they are underrepresented in the wealthiest group and overrepresented at the bottom. Life expectancy for blacks is substantially lower than for whites.<sup>23</sup> Even those blacks who are now part of the elite may experience racism, the belief that blacks are inferior. Thus, blacks may have to be better than whites to get promoted, or it may be assumed that they got ahead just because they were black. Whites often expect them to be "ambassadors," to be called on mainly for knowledge about how to handle situations involving other blacks. They may work with whites, but go home to black neighborhoods. Or they may live in white neighborhoods and experience considerable isolation. Few blacks in the United States can avoid the anguish of racism.<sup>24</sup>

Another example of a caste group in a class society was the Eta of Japan. Unlike blacks in America, the Eta (now called the Dowa Kankeisha) were physically indistinguishable from other Japanese. Comparable to India's untouchables, they were a hereditary, endogamous (in-marrying) group. Their occupations were traditionally those of farm laborer, leatherworker, and basket weaver; their standard of living was very low. Discrimination against the Dowa Kankeisha was officially abolished by the Japanese government in 1871; more active steps have been taken recently. Since 1965, the government of Japan has been attempting to improve living conditions for the Dowa and discourage discrimination against them.<sup>25</sup>

In Rwanda, a country in east-central Africa, a longtime caste system was overthrown, first by an election and then by a revolution in 1959-1960. Three castes had existed, each distinguished from the others by physical appearance and occupation. The ruling caste, the Tutsi, constituted about 15 percent of the population. They were the landlords and practiced the prestigious occupation of herding. The agricultural caste, the Hutu, made up about 85 percent of the population. As tenants of the Tutsi, they produced most of the country's food. The Twa, accounting for less than 1 percent of the population, were a Pygmy group of foragers who formed the lowest caste. It is believed that the three castes derived from three different language groups who came together through migration and conquest. Later, however, they came to use a common language, although remaining endogamous and segregated by hereditary occupations. When the Hutu united to demand more of the rewards of their labor in 1959, the king and many of the Tutsi ruling caste were driven out of the country. The Hutu then established a republican form of government and declared independence from Belgium. In this new government, however, the forest-dwelling Twa were generally excluded from full citizenship. The interethnic rivalry did not end there. Recently, Rwanda has had mass murders and civil war, largely between the Hutus and the Tutsis, with hundreds of thousands of people killed in 1993-1994.

### Slavery

Slaves are persons who do not own their own labor, and as such they represent a class. Slavery has existed in various forms in many times and places, regardless of race and culture. Sometimes it has been a closed class, or caste, system, sometimes a relatively open class system. In different slave-owning societies, slaves have had different, but always some, legal rights.<sup>26</sup>

In ancient Greece, slaves often were conquered enemies. Because city-states were constantly conquering one another or rebelling against former conquerors, slavery was a threat to everyone. After the Trojan War, the transition of Hecuba from queen to slave was marked by her cry "Count no one happy, however fortunate, before he dies."27 Nevertheless, Greek slaves were considered human beings, and they could even acquire some higher

class status along with freedom. Andromache, Hecuba's daughter-in-law, was taken as slave and concubine by one of the Greek heroes. When his legal wife produced no children, Andromache's slave son became heir to his father's throne. Although slaves had no rights under law, once they were freed, either by the will of their master or by purchase, they and their descendants could become assimilated into the dominant group. In other words, slavery in Greece was not seen as the justified position of inferior people. It was regarded, rather, as an act of fate—"the luck of the draw"—that relegated a victim to the lowest class in society.

Among the Nupe, a society in central Nigeria, slavery was of quite another type.<sup>28</sup> The methods of obtaining slaves—as part of the booty of warfare, and later by purchase—were similar to those of Europeans, but the position of the slaves was very different. Mistreatment was rare. Male slaves were given the same opportunities to earn money as other dependent males in the household-younger brothers, sons, or other relatives. A slave might be given a garden plot of his own to cultivate, or he might be given a commission if his master was a craftsman or a tradesman. Slaves could acquire property, wealth, and even slaves of their own. But all of a slave's belongings went to the master at the slave's death.

**Manumission**, the granting of freedom, was built into the Nupe system. If a male slave could afford the marriage payment for a free woman, the children of the resulting marriage were free; the man himself, however, remained a slave. Marriage and concubinage were the easiest ways out of bondage for a slave woman. Once she had produced a child by her master, both she and the child had free status. The woman, however, was only figuratively free: if a concubine, she had to remain in that role. As might be expected, the family trees of the nobility and the wealthy were liberally grafted with branches descended from slave concubines.

The most fortunate slaves among the Nupe were the house slaves. They could rise to positions of power in the household as overseers and bailiffs, charged with law-enforcement and judicial duties. (Recall the Old Testament story of Joseph, who was sold into slavery by his brothers. Joseph became a household slave of the pharaoh and rose to the position of second in the kingdom because he devised an ingenious system of taxation.) There was even a titled group of Nupe slaves-the Order of Court Slaves—who were trusted officers of the king and members of an elite. Slave status in general, though, placed one at the bottom of the social ladder. In

the Nupe system, few slaves, mainly princes from their own societies, ever achieved membership in the titled group.

In the United States, slavery originated as a means of obtaining cheap labor, but the slaves soon came to be regarded as deserving of their low status because of their alleged inherent inferiority. Because the slaves were black, some whites justified slavery and belief in black people's inferiority by quoting Scripture out of context ("they shall be hewers of wood and drawers of water"). Slaves could not marry or make any other contracts, nor could they own property. In addition, their children were also slaves, and the master had sexual rights over the female slaves. Because the status of slavery was determined by birth in the United States, slaves constituted a caste. During the days of slavery, therefore, the United States had both a caste and a class system. And even after the abolition of slavery, as we have noted, some castelike elements remained.

As for why slavery may have developed in the first place, the cross-cultural evidence is as yet inconclusive. We do know, however, that slavery is not an inevitable stage in economic development, contrary to what some persons have assumed. In other words, slavery is not found mainly in certain economies, such as those dependent on intensive agriculture. (Unlike the United States until the Civil War, many societies with intensive agriculture did not develop any variety of slavery.) Also, the hypothesis that slavery develops where available resources are plentiful but labor is scarce is not supported by the cross-cultural evidence. All we can say definitely is that slavery does not occur in developed or industrial economies; either it disappears or it was never present in them.<sup>29</sup>

# THE EMERGENCE OF STRATIFICATION

Anthropologists are not certain why social stratification developed. Nevertheless, they are reasonably sure that higher levels of stratification emerged relatively recently in human history. Archaeological sites dating before about 7,500 years ago do not show extensive evidence of inequality. Houses do not appear to vary much in size or content, and burials seem to be more or less the same, suggesting that their occupants were treated the same in life and death. Another indication that stratification is a relatively recent development in human history is the fact that certain cultural features associated with stratification also developed relatively recently. For example, most societies that depend primarily on agriculture or herding have social classes.<sup>30</sup> Agriculture and herding developed within the past 10,000 years, so we may assume that most food collectors in the distant past lacked social classes. Other recently developed cultural features associated with class stratification include fixed settlements, political integration beyond the community level, the use of money as a medium of exchange, and the presence of at least some full-time specialization.<sup>31</sup>

In 1966, the comparative sociologist Gerhard Lenski suggested that the 10,000-year-old trend toward increasing inequality was reversing. He argued that inequalities of power and privilege in industrial societies-measured in terms of the concentration of political power and the distribution of income are less pronounced than inequalities in complex preindustrial societies. Technology in industrialized societies is so complex, he suggested, that those in power are compelled to delegate some authority to subordinates if the system is to work. In addition, a decline in the birth rate in industrialized societies, coupled with the need for skilled labor, has pushed

the average wage of workers far above the subsistence level, resulting in greater equality in the distribution of income. Finally, Lenski also suggested that the spread of the democratic ideology, and particularly its acceptance by elites, has significantly broadened the political power of the lower classes.<sup>32</sup> A few studies have tested and supported Lenski's hypothesis that inequality has decreased with industrialization. In general, nations that are highly industrialized exhibit a lower level of inequality than nations that are only somewhat industrialized.<sup>33</sup> But, as we have seen, even the most industrialized societies may still have an enormous degree of inequality.

Why did social stratification develop in the first place? On the basis of his study of Polynesian societies, Marshall Sahlins suggested that an increase in agricultural productivity results in social stratification.<sup>34</sup> According to Sahlins, the degree of stratification is directly related to the production of a surplus, which is made possible by greater technological efficiency. The higher the level of productivity and the larger the agricultural surplus, the greater the scope and complexity of the distribution system. The status of the chief, who serves as redistributing agent, is in turn enhanced. Sahlins argued that the differentiation between distributor and producer inevitably gives rise to differentiation in other aspects of life:

> First, there would be a tendency for the regulator of distribution to exert some authority over production itself—especially over productive activities which necessitate subsidization, such as communal labor or specialist labor. A degree of control of production implies a degree of control over the utilization of resources, or, in other words, some preeminent property rights. In turn, regulation of these economic processes necessitates the exercise of authority in interpersonal affairs; differences in social power emerge.<sup>35</sup>

Sahlins later rejected the idea that a surplus leads to chiefships, postulating instead that the relationship may be the other way around-that is, leaders encourage the development of a surplus so as to enhance their prestige through feasts, potlatches, and other redistributive events.<sup>36</sup> Of course, both trajectories are possible: surpluses may generate stratification, and stratification may generate surpluses. Those two possibilities are not mutually exclusive.

Lenski's theory of the causes of stratification is similar to Sahlins's original idea. Lenski, too, argued that production of a surplus is the stimulus in the de**Current Issues** 

# IS INEQUALITY BETWEEN COUNTRIES INCREASING?

When people support themselves by what they collect and produce themselves, as most people the world over did until a few thousand years ago, it is difficult to compare the standards of living of different societies because we cannot translate what people have into market or monetary value. It is only where people are at least partially involved in the world market economy that we can measure the standard of living in monetary terms. Nowadays, this comparison is possible for most of the world; many people in most societies depend on buying and selling for a living. And the more people there are who depend on international exchange, the more possible it is to compare them in terms of standard economic indicators. We do not have such indicators for all the different societies, but we do have them for many countries. Those indicators suggest that the degree of economic inequality in the world is not only

velopment of stratification, but he focused primarily on the conflict that arises over control of that surplus. Lenski concluded that the distribution of the surplus will be determined on the basis of power. Thus, inequalities in power promote unequal access to economic resources and simultaneously give rise to inequalities in privilege and prestige.<sup>37</sup>

The "surplus" theories of Sahlins and Lenski do not really address the question of why the redistributors or leaders will want, or be able, to acquire greater control over resources. After all, the redistributors or leaders in many rank societies do not have greater wealth than others, and custom seems to keep things that way. One suggestion is that as long as followers have mobility, they can vote with their feet by moving away from leaders they do not like. But when people start to make more permanent "investments" in land or technology (for example, irrigation systems or weirs for fishing), they are more likely to put up with a leader's aggrandizement in exchange for protection.<sup>38</sup> Another suggestion is that access to economic resources bevery substantial but is increasing.

The "champagne glass" figure conveys how unequal are the rich and poor of the world. If you consider gross national product (GNP), which is a measure for each country of how much is produced (in U.S. dollars), and compare it across countries, the richest fifth (20 percent) of the world's population controls 84.7 percent of the world's total gross national product. The poorest fifth (20 percent) controls only 1.4 percent of the world's output. As the figure shows, similar disparities exist if you compare trade, domestic savings, or domestic investment. To evaluate changes over time, we can compare the ratio between the richest and poorest fifths over time. In 1991 the ratio was 60.5 to 1, which is calculated by dividing the 84.7 percent for the top fifth by 1.4 for the bottom fifth. That ratio has increased since the 1960s. In 1960 the ratio was 30 to 1, in 1970 it was 32 to 1, in 1980 it was 45 to 1.

If the world as a whole is see-

ing improvements in technology and economic development, why is inequality in the world increasing? As we shall see later, in the chapter on culture change, it is often the rich within a society who benefit most from new technology, at least initially. They are not only the most likely to be able to afford it; they also are the only ones who can afford to take the risks that it involves. The same may be true for nations. Those that already have capital are more likely than the poorer nations to take advantage of improvements in technology. In addition, the poorer countries generally have the highest rates of population growth, so income per capita can fall if population increases faster than the rate of economic development. Econmists tell us that a developing country may, at least initially, experience an increase in inequality, but the inequality often decreases over time. Will the inequalities among countries also decrease as the world economy develops further?

The picture is not entirely bleak. It is true that the disparity between rich and poor countries has increased in recent years, but it is also true that the world economy has improved in some respects. The United Nations Organization has computed a "human development index" for 114 countries, combining measures of life expectancy, literacy, and a measure of per capita purchasing power. According to this index, all countries have improved over a period of 30 years, many of them substantially. If this trend continues, there might be less inequality among countries in the future.

comes unequal only when there is population pressure on resources in rank or chiefdom societies.<sup>39</sup> Such pressure may be what induces redistributors to try to keep more land and other resources for themselves and their families.

C. K. Meek offered an example of how population pressure in northern Nigeria may have led to economic stratification. At one time, a tribal member could obtain the right to use land by asking permission of the chief and presenting him with a token gift in recognition of his higher status. But by 1921, the reduction in the amount of available land had led to a system under which applicants offered the chief large payments for scarce land. As a result of these payments, farms came to be regarded as private property, and differential access to such property became institutionalized.<sup>40</sup>

Future research by archaeologists, sociologists, historians, and anthropologists should provide more understanding of the emergence of social stratification in human societies and how and why it may vary in degree.

1. Whereas sociologists contend that social stratification is universal because individual inequalities exist in all societies, anthropologists argue that egalitarian societies exist in the sense that there are societies in which access to advantages is equally available to all social groups.

2. The presence or absence of customs or rules that give certain groups unequal access to economic resources, power, and prestige can be used to distinguish three types of societies. In egalitarian societies, social groups do not have unequal access to economic resources, power, or prestige-they are unstratified. In rank societies, social groups do not have unequal access to economic resources or power, but they do have unequal access to prestige. Rank societies, then, are partially stratified. In class societies, social groups have unequal access to economic resources, power, and prestige. They are more completely stratified than are rank societies.

3. Stratified societies range from somewhat open class systems to caste systems, which are extremely rigid, since caste membership is fixed permanently at birth.

4. Slaves are persons who do not own their own labor; as such, they represent a class and sometimes even a caste. Slavery has existed in various forms in many times and places, regardless of race and culture. Sometimes slavery is a rigid and closed, or caste, system; sometimes it is a relatively open class system.

5. Social stratification appears to have emerged relatively recently in human history, about 7,500 years ago. This conclusion is based on archaeological evidence and on the fact that certain cultural features associated with stratification developed relatively recently.

6. One type of theory suggests that social stratification developed as productivity increased and surpluses were produced. Another suggestion is that stratification can develop only when people have "investments" in land or technology and therefore cannot move away from leaders they do not like. A third type of theory suggests that stratification emerges only when there is population pressure on resources in rank societies.
