# Communication and Language

![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg)

Few of us can remember the moment when we first became aware that words signified something. Yet that moment was a milestone for us, not just in the acquisition of language but in becoming acquainted with all the complex, elaborate behavior that constitutes our culture. Without language, the transmission of complex traditions would be virtually impossible, and each person would be trapped within his or her own world of private sensations.

Helen Keller, left deaf and blind by illness at the age of nineteen months, gives a moving account of the afternoon she first established contact with another human being through words.

> [My teacher] brought me my hat, and I knew I was going out into the warm sunshine. This thought, if a wordless sensation may be called a thought, made me hop and skip with pleasure.

> We walked down the path to the well house, attracted by the fragrance of the honeysuckle with which it was covered. Someone was drawing water and my teacher placed my hand under the spout. As the cool stream gushed over one hand she spelled into the other the word *water*, first slowly, then rapidly. Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of something forgotten—a thrill of returning thought; and somehow the mystery of language was revealed to me. I knew then that w-a-t-e-r meant the wonderful cool something that was flowing over my hand. That living word awakened my soul, gave it light, hope, joy, set it free! There were barriers still, it is true, barriers that could in time be swept away.

> I left the well house eager to learn. Everything had a name, and each name gave birth to a new thought. As we returned to the house every object which I touched seemed to quiver with life. That was because I saw everything with the strange, new sight that had come to me.1

# COMMUNICATION

Against all odds, Helen Keller had come to understand the essential function language plays in all societies-namely, that of communication. The word communicate comes from the Latin verb communicare, "to share," "to impart that which is com*mon.*" We communicate by agreeing, consciously or unconsciously, to call an object, a movement, or an abstract concept by a common name. For example, speakers of English have agreed to call the color of grass green, even though we have no way of comparing precisely how two persons actually experience this color. What we share is the agreement to call similar sensations green. Any system of language

consists of publicly accepted symbols by which individuals try to share private experiences.

Our communication obviously is not limited to spoken language. We communicate directly through body stance, gesture, and tone of voice and indirectly through systems of signs and symbols, such as writing, algebraic equations, musical scores, painting, code flags, and road signs. But despite all the competing systems of communication available to us, we must recognize the overriding importance of spoken language. It is probably the major transmitter of culture, allowing us to share and pass on our complex configuration of attitudes, beliefs, and patterns of behavior.

# Animal Communication

Systems of communication are not unique to human beings. Other animal species communicate in a variety of ways. One way is by sound: a bird may communicate by a call that "this is my territory"; a squirrel may utter a cry that leads other squirrels to flee from danger. Another means of animal communication is odor. An ant releases a chemical when it dies, and its fellows then carry it away to the compost heap. Apparently the communication is highly effective; a healthy ant painted with the death chemical will be dragged to the funeral heap again and again.

Another means of communication, body movement, is used by bees to convey the location of food sources. Karl von Frisch discovered that the black Austrian honey bee—by choosing a round dance, a wagging dance, or a short, straight run—could communicate not only the precise direction of the source of food but also its distance from the hive.<sup>2</sup>

Although primates use all three methods of communication-sound, odor, and body movement-sound is the method that most concerns us in this chapter because spoken language is our own major means of communication. Nonhuman primates communicate vocally too, making various kinds of calls (but not very many of them). In the past, only human communication was thought to be symbolic. Recent research suggests that some monkey and ape calls in the wild are also symbolic.

When we say that a communication (call, word, sentence) is *symbolic*, we mean at least two things. First, the communication has meaning even when its referent (whatever is referred to) is not present. Second, the meaning is arbitrary: the receiver of the message could not guess its meaning just from the sound(s) and does not know the

![](_page_2_Picture_0.jpeg)

We have known for some time that parrots can mimic human speech. But the fact that Irene Pepperberg's parrot named Alex has learned to understand spoken sentences and to reply appropriately to questions about quantities and colors suggests that even a bird-brain is not too small to be capable of symbolic communication. How else can we explain Alex's mostly correct counts (80 percent of the time) of "two," "three," "four," "five," and "sih" (six) for new objects that he is asked to give the number of?

meaning instinctively. In other words, symbols have to be learned. There is no compelling or "natural" reason that the word *dog* in English should refer to a smallish four-legged carnivore that is the bane of letter carriers.

Vervet monkeys in Africa are not as closely related to humans as are African apes. Nevertheless, scientists who have observed vervet monkeys in their natural environment consider at least three of their alarm calls to be symbolic because each of them *means* (refers to) a different kind of predator—eagles, pythons, leopards—and monkeys react differently to each call. For example, they look up when they hear the "eagle" call. Experimentally, in the absence of the referent, investigators have been able to evoke the normal reaction to a call by playing it back electronically. Another indication that the vervet alarm calls are symbolic is that infant vervets appear to need some time to learn the referent for each. When they are very young, infants apply a particular call to more animals than adult veryets apply the call to. So, for example, infant vervets will often make the eagle warning call when they see any flying bird. The infants learn the appropriate referent apparently through adult vervets' repetition of infants' "correct" calls; in any case, the infants gradually learn to restrict the call to eagles. This process is probably not too different from the way a North American infant in an English-speaking family first applies the "word" dada to all adult males and gradually learns to restrict it to one person.<sup>3</sup>

All of the nonhuman vocalizations we have described so far enable individual animals to convey messages. The sender gives a signal that is received and "decoded" by the receiver, who usually responds with a specific action or reply. How is human vocalization different? Since monkeys and apes appear to use symbols at least some of the time, it is not appropriate to emphasize symbolism as the distinctive feature of human language. However, there is a significant quantitative difference between human language and other primates' systems of vocal communication-all human languages employ a much larger set of symbols. Another and perhaps more important difference is that the other primates' vocal systems tend to be *closed*: different calls are not often combined to produce new, meaningful utterances. In contrast, as we shall see, human languages are open systems, governed by complex rules about how sounds and sequences of sounds can be combined to produce an infinite variety of new meanings.<sup>4</sup>

The idea that humans can transmit many more complex messages than any other animal does not begin to convey how different human language is from other communication systems. No chimpanzee could say the equivalent of "I'm going to the ball game next Wednesday with my friend Jim if it's not raining." Humans can not only talk (and think) with language about things completely out of context; they also can be deliberately or unconsciously ambiguous in their messages. If a person asks you for help, you could say, "Sure, I'll do it when I have time," leaving the other person uncertain about whether your help is ever going to materialize.

Primates in the wild do not exhibit anything close to human language. But recent successful attempts to teach apes to communicate with humans and with each other using human-created signs have led some scholars to question the traditional assumption that the gap between human and other animal communication is enormous. Chimpanzees Washoe and Nim and the gorilla Koko were taught hand signs based on American Sign Language (ASL; used by the deaf in the United States). The chimpanzee Sarah was trained with plastic symbols, but more recently Lana, Sherman, Austin, and a pygmy chimpanzee, Kanzi, have been trained on symbol keyboards connected to computers. Sherman and Austin began to communicate with each other about actions they were intending to do, such as the types of tools they needed to solve a problem. And they were able to classify items into categories, such as "food" and "tools." In contrast to other apes, Kanzi learned symbols just by seeing humans point to them when they spoke to him. He did not need rewards or to have his hands put in the right position. And he understood a great deal of what was spoken to him. For example, when he was five years old, Kanzi heard someone talk about throwing a ball in the river, and he turned around and did so. Kanzi has come closest of all the "students" to having a primitive English grammar when he strings symbols together.<sup>5</sup> If chimpanzees and other primates have the capacity to use nonspoken language and even to understand spoken language, then the difference between humans and nonhumans may not be as great as people used to think.

Are these apes really using language? There is a lot of agreement among investigators that nonhuman primates have the ability to "symbol"—to refer to something (or a class of things) with an arbitrary "label" (gesture or sequence of sounds).<sup>6</sup> For example, the gorilla Koko (with a repertoire of about 375 signs) extended the sign for *drinking straw* to plastic tubing, hoses, cigarettes, and radio antennae. Washoe originally learned the sign dirty to refer to feces and other soil and then began to use it insultingly, as in "dirty Roger," when her trainer Roger Fouts refused to give her things she wanted. Even the mistakes made by the apes suggest that they are using signs symbolically, just as words are used in spoken language. For example, the sign *cat* may be used for dog if the animal learned cat first (just as our daughter Kathy said "dog" to all pictures of four-footed animals, including elephants, when she was eighteen months old).

In spite of the new evidence, Jane Hill believes that the answer about whether apes use language is still quite controversial because language is not one unitary thing. For instance, when we get to the structure of sounds (phonology) later in this chapter, we will see that every human language has certain ways of combining sounds and ways of not combining those sounds. Although apes do not use sounds, the combination of symbols can be thought of as analogous to the combining of sound elements. Yet there does not appear to be anything comparable to linguistic rules for allowed and not allowed combinations. Another major difference is that humans have many kinds of discourse. Humans may make lists and speeches, tell stories, argue, and recite poetry. Apes do none of those things. But apes do have some of the capacities for some of the elements of human language. Therefore understanding their capacities may help us better understand the evolution of human language.7

# THE ORIGINS OF LANGUAGE

How long humans have had spoken language is not known. Recently, Philip Lieberman and Jeffrey Laitman have argued that language as we know it developed only with the emergence of modern-looking humans (before or about 100,000 years ago) who had the mouth and throat anatomy we have.<sup>8</sup> According to Lieberman and Laitman, premodern humans (including the Neandertals) did not have the vocal anatomy required for language. Their argument is based on controversial reconstructions of the mouths and throats of earlier humans, and so their conclusions are not widely accepted.<sup>9</sup>

Most speculation about the origins of language has centered on the question of how natural selection may have favored the open quality of language. All known human languages are open in the sense that utterances can be combined in various ways to produce new meanings.<sup>10</sup> Somehow a call system of communication was eventually changed to a system based on small units of sound that could be put together in many different ways to form meaningful utterances. For example, an English speaker can combine care and full (careful) to mean one thing, then use each of the two elements in other combinations to mean different things. Care can be used to make carefree, careless, or caretaker; full can be used to make *powerful* or *wonderful*. And, because language is a system of shared symbols, it can be reformed into an infinite variety of expressions and be understood by all who share these symbols. In this way, for example, T. S. Eliot could form a sentence never before formed—"In the room the women come and go / talking of Michelangelo,"11and the sense of his sentence, though not necessarily his private meaning, could be understood by all speakers of English.

One set of theoreticians of grammar suggests that there may be a language-acquisition device in the brain, as innate to humans as call systems are to the other animals.<sup>12</sup> As the forebrain evolved, this device may have become part of our biological inheritance. Whether the device in fact exists is not yet clear. But we do know that the actual development of individual language is not completely biologically determined; if it were, all human beings would speak the same brain-generated language. Instead, about 4,000 to 5,000 mutually unintelligible languages have been identified. More than 2,000 of them were still spoken as of recently, most by peoples who did not traditionally have a system of writing. Indeed, the earliest writing systems are not that old; they appeared only about 5,000 years ago.<sup>13</sup>

Can we learn anything about the origins of language by studying the languages of nonliterate and technologically simpler societies? The answer is no, because such languages are not simpler or less developed than ours. The sound systems, vocabularies, and grammars of technologically simpler peoples are in no way inferior to those of peoples with more complex technology.<sup>14</sup>

Of course, Australian aborigines will not be able to name the sophisticated machines used in our society. Their language, however, has the potential for doing so. As we will see later in this chapter, all languages possess the amount of vocabulary their speakers need, and languages expand in response to cultural changes. A language that lacks terminology for some of our conveniences may have a rich vocabulary for events or natural phenomena that are of particular importance to the people in that society.

If there are no primitive languages, and if the earliest languages have left no traces that would allow us to reconstruct them, does that mean we cannot investigate the origins of language? Some linguists think that understanding the way children acquire language, which we discuss shortly, can help us understand the origins of language. Recently, other linguists have suggested that an understanding of how creole languages develop will also tell us something about the origins of language.

# Creole Languages

Some languages have developed quite recently in various places around the world where European colonial powers established commercial enterprises that relied on imported labor, generally slaves. The laborers in one place often came from several different societies and in the beginning would speak with their masters and with each other in some kind of *pidgin* (simplified) version of the masters' language. Pidgin languages lack many of the building blocks found in the languages of whole societies, building blocks such as prepositions (*to*, *on*, and so forth) and auxiliary verbs (designating future and other tenses). Many pidgin languages developed into and were replaced by so-called creole languages, which incorporate much of the vocabulary

of the masters' language but also have a grammar that differs from it and from the grammars of the laborers' native languages.<sup>15</sup>

Derek Bickerton argues that there are striking grammatical similarities in creole languages all over the world. This similarity, he thinks, is consistent with the idea that there is a universal grammar inherited by all humans. Creole languages, therefore, may resemble early human languages. All creoles use intonation instead of a change in word order to ask a question. The creole equivalent of the question "Can you fix this?" would be to say, "You can fix this?" The creole version puts a rising inflection at the end; in contrast, the English version reverses the subject and verb without much inflection at the end. Creoles all express the future and the past in the same grammatical way, by the use of particles (such as the English shall) between subject and verb, and they all employ double negatives, as in the Guyana English creole "Nobody no like me."16

# Children's Acquisition of Language

Apparently a child is equipped from birth with the capacity to reproduce all the sounds used by the world's languages and to learn any system of grammar. The language the child learns is the one spoken by the parents or caretakers.

Children's acquisition of the structure and meaning of language has been called the most difficult intellectual achievement in life. If that is so, it is pleasing to note that they accomplish it with relative ease and vast enjoyment. This "difficult intellectual achievement" may in reality be a natural response to the capacity for language that is one of humans' genetic characteristics. All over the world children begin to learn language at about the same age-and in no culture do children wait until they are seven or ten years old. By twelve or thirteen months children are able to name a few objects and actions and by eighteen to twenty months they seem to be able to make one key word stand for a whole sentence: "Out!" for "Take me out for a walk right now"; "Juice!" for "I want some juice now." Evidence now suggests that children acquire the concept of a word as a whole, learning sequences of sounds that are stressed or at the ends of words (for example, "raffe" for giraffe). Even deaf children learning signs in ASL tend to acquire and use signs in a similar fashion.<sup>17</sup>

Children the world over tend to progress to two-word sentences at the age of about eighteen to twenty-four months. In those sentences they ex**Current Issues** 

# CAN LANGUAGES BE KEPT FROM EXTINCTION?

Not only animal and plant species are endangered; many peoples and their languages are too. In the last few hundred years (and continuing in some places today), Western expansion and colonization have led to the depopulation and extinction of many native societies, mainly as a result of introduced disease and campaigns of extermination. Thus, many languages disappeared with the peoples that spoke them. More than fifty aboriginal languages in Australia (of approximately 200) disappeared relatively quickly as a result of massacre and disease. Nowadays native languages are endangered more by the fact that they are not being passed on to children. Political and economic dominance by speakers of Western languages undoubtedly play an enormous role in this process. First, schooling is usually conducted in the dominant language. Second, when another culture is dominant, the children themselves may prefer to speak in the language perceived to have higher prestige; indeed, parents sometimes encourage this tendency. It is estimated that by the year 2000 almost all the languages of aboriginal Australia will be gone. This is a worldwide trend. Michael Krauss, a linguist who tracks disappearing languages, estimates that 90 percent of the world's languages are endangered. Here is another example: only two of the twenty native Alaskan languages are currently being taught to children, who therefore speak English only.

What can be done? Krauss, who is particularly interested in native Alaskan languages, is trying to do something. With help from the state government of Alaska, Krauss is developing materials on native languages to help teachers promote bilingual education as a way of preserving native languages. A very different approach has been taken by H. Russell Bernard, who believes that "to keep a language truly alive we must produce authors." With the help of computer technology, which allows reconfiguring a keyboard to produce special characters for sounds, Bernard has taught native speakers to write their native languages directly on computers. These texts then become the basis for dictionaries. So far, more than eighty people, speaking twelve endangered languages, have become authors in Mexico and South America. Although these authors may not be using the standardized characters used by linguists to represent sounds, they are producing "written" materials that might otherwise be lost forever. These texts provide more than just information about language-in their works the authors convey ideas about curing illness, acquiring food, raising children, and settling disputes.

We are not sure when humans first developed spoken language. But the enormous linguistic diversity on this planet took a long time to develop. Unfortunately, it may take only a short time for that diversity to become a thing of the past.

press themselves in "telegraph" form—using nounlike words and verblike or function words but leaving out the seemingly less important words. So a two-word sentence such as "Shoes off" may stand for "Take my shoes off" or "More milk" may stand for "Give me more milk please."<sup>18</sup> They do not utter their two words in random order, sometimes saying "off" first, other times saying "shoes" first. If a child says "shoes off" then he or she will also say "clothes off" and "hat off." They seem to select an order that fits the conventions of adult language, so they are likely to say "Daddy eat," not "Eat Daddy." In other words, they tend to put the subject first, as adults do. And they tend to say

![](_page_6_Picture_0.jpeg)

Toward the end of their first year, babies begin to name a few objects and actions.

"Mommy coat" rather than "Coat Mommy" to indicate "Mommy's coat."<sup>19</sup> Parents do not utter sentences such as "Daddy eat," so children seem to know a lot about how to put words together with little or no direct teaching from their parents. Consider the five-year-old who, confronted with the unfamiliar "Gloria in Excelsis," sang quite happily, "Gloria eats eggshells." To make the words fit the structure of English grammar was more important than to make the words fit the meaning of the Christmas pageant.

If there is a basic grammar imprinted in the human mind, we should not be surprised that children's early and later speech patterns seem to be similar in different languges. We might also expect children's later speech to be similar to the structure of creole languages. And it is, according to Derek Bickerton.<sup>20</sup> The "errors" children make in speaking are consistent with the grammar of creoles. For example, English-speaking children three to four years old tend to ask questions by intonation alone, and they tend to use double negatives such as "I don't see no dog," even though the adults around them do not speak that way and consider the children's speech "wrong."

Future research on children's acquisition of language and on the structure of creole languages may bring us closer to understanding the origins of human language. But even if there is a universal grammar, we still need to understand how and why the thousands of languages in the world vary—which brings us to the conceptual tools linguists have had to invent in order to study languages.

# STRUCTURAL LINGUISTICS

In every society children do not need to be taught "grammar" to learn how to speak. They begin to grasp the essential structure of their language at a very early age, without direct instruction. If you show English-speaking children a picture of one "gork" and then a picture of two of these creatures, they will say there are two "gorks." They somehow know that adding an  $s$  to a noun means more than one. But they do not know this consciously, and adults may not either. One of the most surprising features of human language is that meaningful sounds and sound sequences are combined according to rules that often are not consciously known by the speakers.

These rules should not be equated with the "rules of grammar" you may have been taught in school (so that you would speak "correctly"). Rather, when linguists talk about rules they are referring to the patterns of speaking that are discoverable in actual speech. Needless to say, there is some overlap between the actual rules of speaking and the "rules" taught in school. But there are rules that children never hear about in school, because their teachers are not linguists and are not aware of them. So when linguists use the term *grammar*, they are *not* referring to the prescriptive rules that people are supposed to follow in speaking. Rather, *grammar* to the linguist consists of the actual, often unconscious principles that predict how most people talk. As we have noted, young children may speak two-word sentences that conform to a linguistic rule, but their speech is hardly considered "correct"!

Discovering the mostly unconscious rules operating in a language is a very difficult task. Linguists have had to invent special concepts and methods of transcription (writing) to permit them to describe:  $(1)$  what the rules or principles are that predict how sounds are made and how they are used (often, slightly varying sounds are used interchangeably in words without creating a difference in meaning);  $(2)$  how sound sequences (and sometimes even individual sounds) convey meaning and how meaningful sound sequences are strung together to form words; and  $(3)$  how words are strung together to form phrases and sentences. Thus, structural (or descriptive) linguistics tries to discover the rules of **phonology** (the patterning of sounds), **morphology** (the patterning of sound sequences and words), and syntax (the patterning of phrases and sentences) that predict how most speakers of a language talk.

Understanding the language of another people is an essential part of understanding the culture of that people. Although sometimes what people say is contradicted by their observed behavior, there is little doubt that it is hard to understand the beliefs, attitudes, values, and worldview of a people without understanding their language and the nuances of how that language is used. Even behavior, which theoretically one can observe without understanding language, usually cannot be readily understood without interpretation. Imagine that you see people go by a certain rock and seemingly walk out of their way to avoid it. Suppose they believe that an evil spirit resides there. How could you possibly know that without being able to ask and to understand their answer?

### Phonology

Most of us have had the experience of trying to learn another language and finding out that some sounds are exceedingly difficult to make. Although the human vocal tract can theoretically make a very large number of different sounds (**phones** to linguists), each language uses only some of them. It is not that we cannot make the sounds that are strange to us; we just have not acquired the habits of making those sounds. And until the sounds become habitual for us, they continue to be difficult to make.

Finding it difficult to make certain sounds is only one of the reasons we have trouble learning a "foreign" language. Another problem is that we may not be used to combining certain sounds or making a certain sound in a particular position in a word. So English speakers find it difficult to combine  $z$  and  $d$ , as Russian speakers often do (because we never do so in English), or to pronounce words in Samoan (a South Pacific language) that begin with the sound English speakers write as  $ng$ , even though we have no trouble putting that sound at the end of words, as in the English *sing* and *hitting*.

In order to study the patterning of sounds, linguists who are interested in phonology have to write down speech utterances as sequences of sound. This task would be almost impossible if linguists were restricted to using their own alphabet (say the one we use to write English), because other languages use sounds that are difficult to represent with the English alphabet or because the alphabet

we use in English can represent a particular sound in different ways. (English writing represents the sound f by f as in food, but also as gh in tough and ph in *phone*.) To overcome these difficulties in writing sounds with the letters of existing writing systems, linguists have developed systems of transcription in which each "letter" or sound symbol is meant to represent one particular sound.

Once linguists have identified the sounds or phones used in a language, they try to identify how those sounds are classified unconsciously (by the speakers of the language) into phonemes. A phoneme is a set of varying sounds that do not make any difference in meaning. In other words, when one phone of a phoneme class is substituted for another phone of the same class, speakers will say that the utterances are the same.

The ways in which sounds are grouped together into phonemes vary from language to language. In English the sound of  $l$  in *lake* is considered quite different from the sound of  $r$  in rake; the two sounds belong to different phonemes because they make a difference in meaning to English speakers. But in Samoan,  $l$  and  $r$  can be used interchangeably in a word without making a difference in meaning; in Samoan, these two sounds belong to the same phoneme. So, Samoan speakers may say "Leupena" sometimes and "Reupena" at other times when they are referring to someone who in English would be called "Reuben." English speakers may joke about languages that confuse  $l$  and  $r$ , but they are not usually aware that we do the same thing with other pairs of sounds. For example, consider how we pronounce the word we spell as "butter." Some people say this word with a  $t$  in the middle; others say it with a  $d$ . We recognize "butter" and "budder" as the same word; the interchangeability of  $t$  and  $d$  in the middle of the word referring to a dairy spread does not make a difference in meaning. Speakers of some other languages would hear "butter" and "budder" as different words and make fun of us for confusing  $t$  and  $d!$  None of this means that a speaker of a language cannot learn to hear or identify the slight difference in sounds in the same phoneme, but the differences do not matter in ordinary circumstances.

After discovering which sounds are grouped into phonemes (that is, which sounds can be substituted for each other without making a difference in meaning), linguists can begin to discover the sound sequences that are allowed in a language and the usually unconscious rules that predict those sequences. For example, words in English rarely start with three nonvowel sounds. But when they do, the first sound or phone is always an s, as in strike and scratch.<sup>21</sup> (Some other words in English may start with three consonants but only two sounds are involved, as in *chrome* where the  $ch$  stands for the sound in  $k$ .) Linguists' descriptions of the patterning of sounds (phonology) in different languages may allow them to investigate why languages vary in their sound rules. For example, why are two or more consonants strung together in some languages, whereas in other languages vowels are always put between consonants? The Samoan language now has a word for "Christmas" borrowed from English. But the borrowed word has been changed to fit the rules of Samoan. In the English word, two consonants come first  $(k$ and  $r$ , which we spell as  $ch$  and  $r$ ). The Samoan word is Kerisimasi: a vowel has been inserted between each pair of consonants and the word ends with a vowel, which is exactly how all Samoan words are constructed.

Some recent research on infants suggests that they may be neurologically "primed" to ignore meaningless variations of sound (those that are part of the same phoneme) in the language they hear at home. After rewarding infants for turning their heads when a sound changes, experimenters began to vary sounds within phomenes to see if Swedish and American infants would respond to those changes. It turns out that as early as six months of age, infants "ignore" sound shifts within the same phoneme of their own language, but they "hear" the sound shift within the phoneme of the other language. Researchers are not sure how babies learn to make this distinction, but they seem to acquire much of the phonology of their language very early indeed.<sup>22</sup>

# Morphology

Morphology is the study of a variety of questions about words, in particular, what words are and how they are formed. We take our words so much for granted that we do not realize how complicated it is to say what words are. People do not usually pause between words when they speak; if we did not know our language, a sentence would seem like a continuous stream of sounds. This is how we first hear a foreign language. It is only when we understand the language and write down what we say that we separate (by spaces) what we call words. But a word is really only an arbitrary sequence of sounds that has a meaning; we would not "hear" words as separate units if we did not understand the language to which they belong.

Because anthropological linguists traditionally investigated unwritten languages, sometimes without the aid of interpreters, they had to figure out which sequences of sounds conveyed meaning. And because words in many languages can often be broken down into smaller meaningful units, linguists had to invent special words to refer to those units. The smallest unit of language that has a meaning is a **morph.** One or more morphs with the same meaning make up a **morpheme**. For example, the prefix in-, as in indefinite, and the prefix un-, as in unclear, are morphs that belong to the morpheme meaning not. A morph or morpheme should not be confused with a word. Although some words are single morphs or morphemes (for example, for and giraffe in English), many words are built on a combination of morphs, generally prefixes, roots, and suffixes. Thus cow is one word, but the word cows contains two meaningful units-a root (cow) and a suffix (pronounced like  $z$ ) meaning more than one. The lexicon of a language, which a dictionary approximates, consists of words and morphs and their meanings.

It seems likely that the intuitive grasp children have of the structure of their language includes a recognition of morphology, the patterning of sound sequences and words. Once they learn that the morph  $|-z|$  added to a noun-type word indicates more than one, they plow ahead with mans, and *childs*; once they grasp that the morpheme class pronounced  $|-t|$  or  $|-d|$  or  $|-ed|$  added to the end of a verb indicates that the action took place in the past, they apply that concept generally and invent *runned*, drinked, costed. They see a ball roll nearer and nearer, and they transfer that concept to a kite, which goes upper and upper. From their mistakes as well as their successes, we can see that they understand the regular uses of morphemes. By the age of seven, they have mastered many of the irregular forms as well-that is, they learn which morphs of a morpheme are used when.

The child's intuitive grasp of the dependence of some morphemes on others corresponds to the linguist's recognition of free morphemes and bound morphemes. A free morpheme has meaning standing alone—that is, it can be a separate word. A *bound* morpheme displays its meaning only when attached to another morpheme. The morph pronounced  $/-t/$ of the bound morpheme meaning past tense is attached to the root walk to produce walked; but the /-t/ cannot stand alone or have meaning by itself.

In English, the meaning of an utterance (containing a subject, verb, object, and so forth) usually

depends on the order of the words. "The dog bit the child" is different in meaning from "The child bit the dog." But in many other languages, the grammatical meaning of an utterance does not depend much, if at all, on the order of the words. Rather, meaning may be determined by how the morphs in a word are ordered. For example, in Luo (a language of East Africa) the same bound morpheme may mean the subject or object of an action. If the morpheme is the prefix to a verb, it means the subject; if it is the suffix to a verb, it means the object. Another way that grammatical meaning may be conveyed is by altering or adding a bound morpheme to a word to indicate what part of speech it is. For example, in Russian, the word for "mail" when it is the subject of a sentence is pronounced something like "pawchtah." When "mail" is used as the object of a verb, as in "I gave her the mail," the ending of the word changes to "pawchtoo." And if I say "What was in the mail?" the word becomes "pawchtyeh."

Some languages have so many bound morphemes that they might express as a complex but single word what is considered a sentence in English. For example, the English sentence "He will give it to you" can be expressed in Wishram, a Chinookan dialect that was spoken along the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest, as acimluda (a-c-im-l-ud-a, literally "will-he-him-thee-to-give-will"). Note that the pronoun  $it$  in English is genderneutral; Wishram requires that it be given a gender, in this case "him."<sup>23</sup>

#### Syntax

Because language is an open system, we can make up meaningful utterances that we have never heard before. We are constantly creating new phrases and sentences. Just as they do for morphology, the speakers of a language seem to have an intuitive grasp of syntax—the rules that predict how phrases and sentences are generally formed. These "rules" may be partly learned in school, but children know many of them even before they get to school. In adulthood, our understanding of morphology and syntax is so intuitive that we can even understand a nonsense sentence, such as the following famous one from Lewis Carroll's *Through the Looking Glass:* 

> 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe

Simply from the ordering of the words in the sentence, we can surmise which part of speech a word is, as well as its function in the sentence. Brillig is an adjective; slithy an adjective; toves a noun and the subject of the sentence; gyre and gimble verbs; and wabe a noun and the object of a prepositional phrase. Of course, an understanding of morphology helps too. The  $-y$  ending in *slithy* is an indication that the latter is an adjective, and the -s ending in toves tells us that we most probably have more than one of these creatures.

In addition to producing and understanding an infinite variety of sentences, speakers of a language can tell when a sentence is not "correct" without consulting grammar books. For example, an English speaker can tell that "Child the dog the hit" is not an acceptable sentence but "The child hit the dog" is fine. There must then be a set of rules underlying how phrases and sentences are constructed in a language.<sup>24</sup> Speakers of a language know these implicit rules of syntax but are not usually consciously aware of them. The linguist's description of the syntax of a language tries to make these rules explicit.

# HISTORICAL LINGUISTICS

The field of **historical linguistics** focuses on how languages change over time. Written works provide the best data for establishing such changes. For example, the following passage from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, written in the English of the fourteenth century, has recognizable elements but is different enough from modern English to require a translation.

> A Frere ther was, a wantowne and a merye, A lymytour, a ful solempne man. In alle the ordres foure is noon that kan *So muche of daliaunce and fair language.* He hadde maad ful many a mariage Of yonge wommen at his owene cost. Unto his ordre he was a noble post. Ful wel biloued and famulier was he With frankeleyns ouer al in his contree, And with worthy wommen of the toun; For he hadde power of confessioun, As seyde hymself, moore than a curat, For of his ordre he was licenciat.

A Friar there was, wanton and merry, A limiter [a friar limited to certain districts], a full *solemn* [*very important*] *man*. In all the orders four there is none that knows *So much of dalliance [flirting] and fair [engaging]* language. He had made [arranged] many a marriage

Of young women at his own cost. *Unto his order he was a noble post [pillar].* Full well beloved and familiar was he With franklins [wealthy landowners] all over his country And also with worthy women of the town; *For he had power of confession,* As he said himself, more than a curate, *For of his order, he was a licentiate [licensed by the* Popel.25

In this passage we can recognize several changes. Many words are spelled differently today. In some cases, meaning has changed; full, for example, would be translated today as *very*. What is less evident is that changes in pronunciation have occurred. For example, the  $g$  in *mariage* (marriage) was pronounced  $zh$ , as in the French from which it was borrowed, whereas now it is pronounced like either g in George.

Because languages spoken in the past leave no traces unless they were written, and most of the languages known to anthropology were not written by their speakers, you might guess that historical linguists can study linguistic change only by studying written languages such as English. But that is not the case. Linguists can reconstruct changes that have occurred by comparing contemporary languages that are very similar. Such languages show phonological, morphological, and syntactical similarities because they usually derive from a common ancestral language. For example, Romanian, Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese have many similarities. On the basis of these similarities, linguists can reconstruct what the ancestral language was like and how it changed into what we call the Romance languages. Of course, these reconstructions can easily be tested and confirmed because we know from many surviving writings what the ancestral language (Latin) was like; and we know from documents how Latin diversified as the Roman Empire expanded. Thus, common ancestry is frequently the reason why neighboring (and sometimes even separated) languages show patterns of similarity.

But languages can be similar for other reasons too. Contact between speech communities, often with one group dominant over another, may lead one language to borrow from the other. For example, English borrowed a lot of vocabulary from French after England was conquered by the French-speaking Normans in A.D. 1066. Languages may also show similarities even though they do not derive from a common ancestral language and even though there has been no contact or borrowing between them; such similarities may reflect common or universal features of human cultures or human brains or both. (As we noted earlier in this chapter, the grammatical similarities exhibited by creole languages may reflect how the human brain is "wired.") Finally, even unrelated and separated languages may show some similarities because of the phenomenon of convergence; similarities can develop because some processes of linguistic change may have only a few possible outcomes.

# Language Families and Culture History

Latin is the ancestral language of the Romance languages. We know this from documentary (written) records. But if the ancestral language of a set of similar languages is not known from written records, linguists still can reconstruct many features of that language by comparing the derived languages. (Such a reconstructed language is called a **protolanguage.**) That is, by comparing presumably related languages, linguists can become aware of the features that many of them have in common, features that were probably found in the common ancestral language. The languages that derive from the same protolanguage are called a language family. Most languages spoken in the world today can be grouped into fewer than thirty families. The language family English belongs to is called Indo-*European*, because it includes most of the languages of Europe and some of the languages of India. About 50 percent of the world's more than 4 billion people speak Indo-European languages.<sup>26</sup> Another very large language family, now spoken by more than a billion people, is Sino-Tibetan, which includes the languages of northern and southern China as well as those of Tibet and Myanmar (or Burma, as it was formerly named).

The field of historical linguistics got its start in 1786 when a British scholar living in India, Sir William Jones, noticed similarities between Sanskrit (the language spoken and written in ancient India) and classical Greek, Latin, and more recent European languages.<sup>27</sup> In 1822, Jakob Grimm, one of the brothers Grimm of fairy-tale fame, formulated rules to describe the sound shifts that had occurred when the various Indo-European languages diverged from each other. So, for example, in English and the other languages in the Germanic branch of the Indo-European family,  $d$  regularly shifted to  $t$  (compare the English *two* and *ten* with the Latin *duo* and *decem*) and  $p$  regularly shifted to

f (English father and foot, Latin pater and pes). Scholars generally agree that the Indo-European languages derive from a language spoken 5,000 to 6,000 years ago.<sup>28</sup> The ancestral Indo-European language, many of whose features have now been reconstructed, is called *proto-Indo-European*, or *PIE* for short. Table  $5-1$  shows the branches and existing languages of the family.

Where did PIE originate? Some linguists believe that the approximate location of a protolanguage is suggested by the words for plants and animals in the derived languages. More specifically, among these different languages, the words that are cognates (that are similar in sound and meaning) presumably refer to plants and animals that were present in the original homeland. So if we know where those animals and plants were located 5,000 to 6,000 years ago, we can guess where PIE people lived. Among all the cognates for trees in the Indo-European languages, Paul Friedrich has identified eighteen that he believes were present

in the eastern Ukraine in 3000 B.C.; on this basis he suggests that the eastern Ukraine was the PIE homeland.<sup>29</sup> Also consistent with this hypothesis is the fact that the Balto-Slavic subfamily of Indo-European (which includes most of the languages in and around the former Soviet Union) has the most tree names (compared with other subfamilies) that are similar to the reconstructed form in proto-Indo-European.<sup>30</sup>

Marija Gimbutas thinks we can even identify the proto-Indo-Europeans archaeologically. She believes that the PIE people were probably the people associated with what is known as the Kurgan culture (5000–2000 B.C.), which spread out of the Ukraine around 3000 B.C. The Kurgan people were herders, keeping and raising horses, cattle, sheep, and pigs. They also relied on hunting and grain cultivation. Burials suggest differences in wealth and special status for men.<sup>31</sup> Why the Kurgan and linguistically similar people were able to expand to many places in Europe and the Near East is not yet clear (some have

suggested that horses and horse-drawn wagons, and perhaps horseback riding, provided important military advantages).<sup>32</sup> In any case, it is clear that many Kurgan cultural elements were distributed after 3000 B.C. over a wide area of the Old World.

Colin Renfrew disagrees with the notion that the Ukraine was the homeland of PIE. He thinks that PIE is 2,000-3,000 years older than Kurgan culture and that the PIE people lived in a different place. Renfrew locates the PIE homeland in eastern Anatolia (Turkey) in 6000-7000 B.C., and he suggests (on the basis of archaeological evidence) that the spread of Indo-European to Europe and what is now Iran, Afghanistan, and India accompanied the spread of farming to those areas.<sup>33</sup>

Just as some historical linguists and archaeologists have suggested when and where the PIE people may have lived originally and how they may have spread, other linguists and archaeologists have suggested culture histories for other language families. For example, the Bantu languages in Africa (spoken by perhaps 100 million people) form a subfamily of the larger Niger-Congo family of languages. Bantu speakers currently live in a wide band across the center of Africa and down the eastern and western sides of southern Africa. All of the Bantu languages presumably derive from people who spoke proto-Bantu. But where was their homeland?

As in the case of proto-Indo-European, different theories have been proposed. But most historical linguists now agree with Joseph Greenberg's suggestion that the origin of Bantu was in what is now the Middle Benue area of eastern Nigeria.<sup>34</sup> The point of origin is presumably where there is the greatest diversity of related languages and dialects (varying forms of a language); it is assumed that the place of origin has had the most time for linguistic diversity to develop, compared with an area only recently occupied by a related language. For example, England (the homeland of English) has more dialect diversity than New Zealand or Australia.

Why were the Bantu able to spread so widely over the last few thousand years? Anthropologists have only begun to guess.<sup>35</sup> Initially, the Bantu probably kept goats and practiced some form of agriculture and thereby were able to spread, displacing hunter-gatherers in the area. As the Bantu speakers expanded, they began to cultivate certain cereal crops and herd sheep and cattle. Around this time, after 1000 B.C., they also began to use and make iron tools, which may have given them significant advantages. In any case, by 1,500 to 2,000 years ago Bantu speakers had spread throughout central Africa and into the northern reaches of southern Africa. But speakers of non-Bantu languages still live in eastern, southern, and southwestern Africa.

# THE PROCESSES OF LINGUISTIC DIVERGENCE

The historical or comparative linguist hopes to do more than record and date linguistic divergence. Just as the physical anthropologist may attempt to develop explanations for human variation, so the linguist investigates the possible causes of linguistic variation.

Some of the divergence undoubtedly comes about gradually. When groups of people speaking the same language lose communication with one another because they become separated either physically or socially, they begin to accumulate small changes in phonology, morphology, and syntax (which occur continuously in any language). Eventually, if the separation continues, the former dialects of the same language will become separate languages; that is, they will become mutually unintelligible, as German and English now are.

Geographical barriers such as large bodies of water, deserts, and mountains may separate speakers of what was once the same language, but distance by itself can also produce divergence. For example, if we compare dialects of English in the British Isles, it is clear that the regions farthest away from each other are the most different linguistically (compare the northeast of Scotland and London).<sup>36</sup> In northern India, hundreds of semi-isolated villages and regions developed hundreds of local dialects. Today, the inhabitants of each village understand the dialects of the surrounding villages and, with a little more difficulty, the dialects of the next circle of villages. But slight dialect shifts accumulate village by village, and it seems as if different languages are being spoken at the opposite ends of the region, which are separated by over a thousand miles.<sup>37</sup>

Even where there is little geographical separation there may still be a great deal of dialect differentiation because of social distance. So, for example, the spread of a linguistic feature may be halted by racial, religious, or social-class differences that inhibit communication.<sup>38</sup> In the village of Khalapur in North India, John Gumperz found substantial differences in speech between the "untouchable" groups and other groups. Members of the untouchable groups have work contacts with members of other groups, but no friendships.<sup>39</sup> Without friendships and the easy communication between friends, dialect differentiation can readily develop.

Whereas isolation brings gradual divergence between speech communities, contact results in greater resemblance. This effect is particularly evident when contact between mutually unintelligible languages introduces borrowed words, which usually name some new item borrowed from the other culture-tomato, canoe, sushi, and so on. Bilingual groups within a culture may also introduce foreign words, especially when the mainstream language has no real equivalent. Thus, salsa has come into English, and le weekend into French.

Conquest and colonization often result in extensive and rapid borrowing, if not linguistic replacement. The Norman conquest of England introduced French as the language of the new aristocracy. It was 300 years before the educated classes began to write in English. During this time the English borrowed words from French and Latin, and the two languages-English and French-became more alike than they would otherwise have been. About 50 percent of the English general vocabulary originated in French. As this example suggests, different social classes may react to language contact differentially. For example, English aristocrats eventually called their meat "pork" and "beef" (derived from the French words), but the people who raised the animals and prepared them for eating continued (at least for a while) to refer to the meat as "pig" and "bull," the original Anglo-Saxon words.

In those 300 years of extensive contact, the grammar of English remained relatively stable. English lost most of its inflections or case endings, but it adopted little of the French grammar. In general, the borrowing of words (particularly free morphemes $^{40}$ ) is much more common than the borrowing of grammar.<sup>41</sup> As we might expect, borrowing by one language from another can make the borrowing language more different from its sibling languages (those derived from a common ancestral language) than it would otherwise be. Partly as a result of the French influence, the English vocabulary looks quite different from the languages to which it is actually most similar in terms of phonology and grammar— German, Dutch, and the Scandinavian languages.

If languages simply diverged gradually we would expect to find many language families and many languages in small areas. Such appears to be the case among the aboriginal languages of northern Australia. But in some areas of the world there are very widespread language families. How, for example, did Indo-European languages become so widespread? Although we cannot be sure what happened in the Indo-European case, it is possible that the ancestral population (and descendants of that population) expanded by military means.<sup>42</sup> Military expansion and conquest can have profound linguistic consequences, much more than simply borrowing some vocabulary as English did from French. For one population may replace another, effectively killing off a language. Conquest can also result in enormous pressure on the conquered to learn and use the language of the superiors. Once children stop being taught their native language, that language cannot survive for long (see Box, page 72).

# RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE

Some attempts to explain the diversity of languages have focused on the possible interactions between language and other aspects of culture. On the one hand, if it can be shown that a culture can affect the structure and content of its language, then it would follow that linguistic diversity derives at least in part from cultural diversity. On the other hand, the direction of influence between culture and language might work in reverse: linguistic features and structures might affect other aspects of the culture.

# Cultural Influences on Language

One way a society's language may reflect its corresponding culture is in lexical content, or vocabulary. Which experiences, events, or objects are singled out and given words may be a result of cultural characteristics.

Basic Words for Colors, Plants, and Animals. Early in this century many linguists pointed to the lexical domain (vocabulary) of color words to illustrate the supposed truth that languages vary arbitrarily or without apparent reason. Different languages had not only different numbers of basic or fundamental color words (from two to twelve or so—for example, the words red, green, and blue in English), but they also, it was thought, had no consistency in the way they classified or divided the colors of the spectrum. But findings from a comparative (cross-linguistic) study contradicted these traditional presumptions about variation in the number and meaning of basic color words. On the basis of their study of at first 20 and later over 100 languages, Brent Berlin and Paul

Kay found that languages did not encode color in completely arbitrary ways.<sup>43</sup>

Although different languages do have different numbers of basic color words, most speakers of any language are very likely to point to the same color chips as the best representatives of particular colors. (For example, people the world over mean more or less the same color when they are asked to select the best "red.") Moreover, there appears to be a nearly universal sequence by which basic color words are added to a language.<sup>44</sup> If a language has just two basic color words, they will always refer to "black" (or dark) hues and "white" (or light) hues. If a language has three basic color words, the third word will nearly always be "red." The next category to appear is either "yellow" or "grue" (green/blue); then different words for green and blue; and so on. To be sure, we usually do not see the process by which basic color words are added to a language. But we can infer the usual sequence because, for example, if a language has a word for "yellow" it will almost always have a word for "red," whereas having a word for "red" does not mean that the language will have a word for "yellow."

What exactly is a basic color word? All languages (even the ones with only two basic color terms) have many different ways of expressing how color varies. For example, in English we have words such as turquoise, blue-green, scarlet, crimson, and sky blue. Linguists do not consider these to be basic color words. In English the basic color words are white, black, red, green, yellow, blue, brown, pink, purple, orange, and gray. One feature of a basic color word is that it consists of a single morph; it cannot include two or more units of meaning. This feature eliminates combinations such as blue-green and sky blue. A second feature of a basic color word is that the color it represents is not generally included in a higher-order color term. For example, scarlet and crimson are usually considered variants of red, turquoise a variant of blue. A third feature is that basic terms tend to be the first-named words when people are asked for color words. Finally, for a word to be considered a basic color word, many individual speakers of the language have to agree on the central meaning (in the color spectrum) of the word.<sup>45</sup>

Why do different societies (languages) vary in number of basic color terms? Berlin and Kay suggest that the number of basic color terms in a language increases with technological specialization as color is used to decorate and distinguish objects.<sup>46</sup> Cross-linguistic variation in number of basic color terms does not mean that some lan-

guages make more color distinctions than others. Every language could make a particular distinction by combining words (for example, "fresh leaf" for green); a language need not have a separate basic term for that color.

A relatively large number of basic color terms are related also to a biological factor.<sup>47</sup> Peoples with darker (more pigmented) eyes seem to have more trouble distinguishing colors at the dark (bluegreen) end of the spectrum than do people with lighter eyes. It might be expected, then, that peoples who live nearer the equator (who tend to have darker eyes, presumably for protection against damaging ultraviolet radiation) would tend to have fewer basic color terms. And they do.<sup>48</sup> Moreover, it seems that the cultural and biological factors are both required to account for cross-linguistic variation in the number of basic color terms. Societies tend to have six or more such terms (with separate terms for blue and green) only when they are relatively far from the equator and only when their cultures are more technologically specialized.<sup>49</sup> As we will see in later chapters, technological specialization tends to go with larger communities, more centralized governments, occupational specialization, and more social inequality. Societies with such traits are often referred to in a shorthand way as more "complex," which should not be taken to mean "better."

Echoing Berlin and Kay's finding that basic color terms seem to be added in a more or less universal sequence, other researchers have found what seem to be developmental sequences in other lexical domains. Two such domains are general, or lifeform, terms for plants and for animals. Life-form terms are higher-order classifications. All languages have lower-order terms for specific plants and animals. For example, English has words such as oak and *pine*, *sparrow* and *salmon*. English speakers make finer distinctions too-pin oak and white pine, white-throated sparrow and red salmon. But why in some languages do people have a larger number of general terms such as tree, bird, and fish? It seems that these general terms show a universal developmental sequence too. That is, terms seem to be added in a somewhat consistent order. After "plant" comes a term for "tree"; then one for "grerb" (small, green, leafy, nonwoody plant); then "bush" (for plants between tree and grerb in size); then "grass"; then "vine."<sup>50</sup> The life-form terms for animals seem also to be added in sequence; after "animal," comes a term for "fish," then "bird," then "snake," then "wug" (for small creatures other than fish, birds, and snakes-for example, worms and bugs), then "mammal."51

More complex societies tend to have a larger number of general, or life-form, terms for plants and animals than do simpler societies, just as they tend to have a larger number of basic color terms. Why? And do all realms or domains of vocabulary increase in size as social complexity increases? If we look at the total vocabulary of a language (as can be counted in a dictionary), more complex societies do have larger vocabularies.<sup>52</sup> But we have to remember that complex societies have many kinds of specialists, and dictionaries will include the terms used by such specialists. If we look instead at the core (nonspecialist) vocabulary of languages, it seems that all languages have a core vocabulary of about the same size.<sup>53</sup> Indeed, although some domains increase in size with social complexity, some remain the same and still others decrease. An example of a smaller vocabulary domain in complex societies is that of specific names for plants. Urban North Americans may know general terms for plants, but they know relatively few names for specific plants. The typical individual in a small-scale society can commonly name 400 to 800 plant species; a typical person in our own and similar societies may be able to name only 40 to 80.<sup>54</sup> The number of life-form terms is larger in societies in which ordinary people know less about particular plants and animals.<sup>55</sup>

The evidence now available strongly supports the idea that the vocabulary of a language reflects the everyday distinctions that are important in the society. Those aspects of environment or culture that are of special importance will receive greater attention in the language.

Grammar. Most of the examples we could accumulate would show that a culture influences the names of things visible in its environment. Evidence for cultural influence on the grammatical structure of a language is less extensive. Harry Hoijer draws attention to the verb categories in the language of the Navaho, a traditionally nomadic people. These categories center mainly in the reporting of events, or eventings, as he calls them. Hoijer notes that in "the reporting of actions and events, and the framing of substantive concepts, Navaho emphasizes movement and specifies the nature, direction, and status of such movement in considerable detail."56 For example, Navaho has one category for eventings that are in motion and another for eventings that have ceased moving. Hoijer concludes that the emphasis on events in the process of occurring reflects the Navaho's nomadic experience over the

centuries, an experience also reflected in their myths and folklore.

A linguistic emphasis on events may or may not be generally characteristic of nomadic peoples. No one has as yet investigated the matter crossculturally or comparatively. But there are indications that systematic comparative research would turn up other grammatical features that are related to cultural characteristics. For example, many languages lack the possessive transitive verb we write as "have," as in "I have." Instead, the language may say something such as "it is to me." A cross-cultural study has suggested that a language may develop the verb "have" after the speakers of that language have developed a system of private property, or personal ownership of resources.<sup>57</sup>As we shall see later in the chapter on economic systems, the concept of private property is far from universal and tends to occur only in complex societies with social inequality. In contrast, many societies have some kind of communal ownership (by kin groups or communities). How people talk about owning seems to reflect how they own: societies that lack a concept of private property also lack the verb have.

### Linguistic Influences on Culture: The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis

There is general agreement that culture influences language. But there is less agreement about the opposite possibility-that language influences (other aspects of) culture. Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf suggested that language is a force in its own right—that it affects how individuals in a society per-

Urban North Americans tend to use general or life-form terms for plants and animals; very few urban North Americans could name the many specific plants in this garden. People in less complex societies know many specific names for plants and animals.

![](_page_15_Picture_8.jpeg)

ceive and conceive reality. This suggestion is known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.<sup>58</sup> In comparing the English language with Hopi, Whorf pointed out that English-language categories convey discreteness with regard to time and space, but Hopi does not. English has a discrete past, present, and future and things occur at a definite time. Hopi expresses things with more of an idea of on-going processes without time being apportioned into fixed segments. According to Richard Wardhaugh, Whorf believed that these language differences lead Hopi and English speakers to see the world differently.<sup>59</sup>

As intriguing as that idea is, the relevant evidence is mixed. Linguists today do not generally accept the view that language coerces thought, but some suspect that particular features of language may facilitate certain patterns of thought.<sup>60</sup> The influences may be clearest in poetry and metaphors (words and phrases applied to other than their ordinary subjects, as in "all the world's a stage").<sup>61</sup> One of the serious problems in testing the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is that researchers need to figure out how to separate the effects of other aspects of culture from the effects of language.

One approach that may reveal the direction of influence between language and culture is to study how children in different cultures (speaking different languages) develop concepts as they grow up. If language influences the formation of a particular concept, we might expect that children will acquire that concept earlier in societies where the languages emphasize that concept. For example, some languages make more of gender differences than others. Do children develop gender identity earlier when their language emphasizes gender? (Very young girls and boys seem to believe they can switch genders by dressing in opposite-sex clothes, suggesting that they have not yet developed a stable sense that they are unchangeably girls or boys.) Alexander Guiora and his colleagues have studied children growing up in Hebrew-speaking homes (Israel), English-speaking homes (the United States), and Finnish-speaking homes (Finland). Hebrew has the most gender emphasis of the three languages; all nouns are either masculine or feminine and even second-person and plural pronouns are differentiated by gender. English emphasizes gender less, differentiating by gender only in the third-person singular (she or her or hers, he or him or his). Finnish emphasizes gender the least; although some words, such as man and woman, convey gender, differentiation by gender is otherwise lacking in the language. Consistent with the idea that language may influence thought, Hebrew-speaking children acquire the concept of stable gender identity the earliest on the average, Finnishspeaking children the latest.<sup>62</sup>

Recently some researchers have suggested that Chinese kindergarten students are better in math than kindergarten students in the United States because the Chinese words for numbers are shorter and easier to remember, and therefore the Chinese students don't have to rely as much on finger counting as do their American counterparts.<sup>63</sup> But just as with the concept of gender and when it is acquired, it is hard to know whether language or something else about the society is creating the difference observed.

# THE ETHNOGRAPHY OF SPEAKING

Traditionally, linguists concentrated on trying to understand the structure of a language, the usually unconscious rules that predict how the people of a given society typically speak. In recent years, many linguists have begun to study how people in a society vary in how they speak. This type of linguistic study, sociolinguistics, is concerned with the ethnography of speaking—that is, with cultural and subcultural patterns of speech variation in different social contexts.<sup>64</sup>

The sociolinguist might ask, for example, what kinds of things one talks about in casual conversation with a stranger. A foreigner may know English vocabulary and grammar well but may not know that one typically chats with a stranger about the weather or where one comes from, and not about what one ate that day or how much money one earns. A foreigner may be familiar with much of the culture of a North American city, but if that person divulges the real state of his or her health and feelings to the first person who says "How are you?" she or he has much to learn about "small talk" in North American English.

Similarly, North Americans tend to get confused in societies where greetings are quite different from ours. People in some other societies may ask as a greeting, "Where are you going?" or "What are you cooking?" Some Americans may think such questions are rude; others may try to answer in excruciating detail, not realizing that only vague answers are expected, just as we don't really expect a detailed answer when we ask people how they are.

*Strangers shake hands when they meet; friends touch each other more. How we speak to others also dif*fers according to degree of friendship.

#### Social Status and Speech

That a foreign speaker of a language may know little about the small talk of that language is but one example of the sociolinguistic principle that what we say and how we say it are not wholly predictable by the rules of our language. Who we are socially and whom we are talking to may greatly affect what we say and how we say it.

In a study interviewing children in a New England town, John Fischer noted that in formal interviews, children were likely to pronounce the ending in words such as singing and fishing, but in informal conversations they said "singin'" and "fishin'." Moreover, he noted that the phenomenon also appeared to be related to social class—children from higher-status families were less likely to drop the ending than were children from lower-status families. Subsequent studies in English-speaking areas tend to support Fischer's observations with regard to this speech pattern. Other patterns are observed as well. For example, in Norwich, England, lower classes tend to drop the  $h$  in words such as *hammer*, but in all classes the pattern of dropping the  $h$  increases in casual situations.<sup>65</sup>

Research has shown that English people from higher-class backgrounds tend to have more homogeneous speech, conforming more to what is considered standard English (the type of speech heard on television or radio), whereas people from lowerclass backgrounds have very heterogeneous speech, varying in their speaking according to the local or dialect area they come from.<sup>66</sup>

In some societies, social status differences may be associated with more marked differentiation of words. Clifford Geertz, in his study of Javanese, showed that the vocabularies of the three rather sharply divided groups in Javanese societypeasants, townspeople, and aristocrats-reflect their separate positions. For example, the concept now will be expressed differently in these three groups: a peasant will use saiki (considered the lowest and roughest form of the word); a townsman will use saniki (considered somewhat more elegant); and an aristocrat will use samenika (the most elegant form).<sup>67</sup>

Status relationships between people can also influence the way they speak to each other. Terms of address are a good example. In English, forms of address are relatively simple. One is called either by a first name or by a title (such as Doctor, or Professor, Ms., Mister) followed by a last name. A study by Roger Brown and Marguerite Ford indicates that terms of address in English vary with the nature of the relationship between the speakers.<sup>68</sup> The reciprocal use of first names generally signifies an informal or intimate relationship between two persons. A title and last name used reciprocally usually indicates a more formal or businesslike relationship between individuals who are roughly equal in status. Nonreciprocal use of first names and titles in English is reserved for speakers who recognize a marked difference in status between them. This status difference can be a function of age (as when a child refers to her mother's friend as Mrs. Miller and is in turn addressed as Sally), or the status difference can be due to occupational hierarchy (as when a person refers to his boss as Ms. Ramirez and is in turn addressed as Joe). In some cases, generally between boys and between men, the use of the last name alone represents a middle ground between the intimate and the formal usages.

In some societies, terms of address do not reflect equality or inequality of social status as much as they reflect other kinds of social relationships. Among the Nuer of the Sudan, kin and age relationships (in addition to the formality of the occasion) influence how you address someone. Soon after birth every Nuer child is given a personal name, which is used by the child's paternal relatives and by close friends in the paternal village. The maternal grandparents give the child another personal name, which the mother's family and friends of her family use. Children also have inherited clan names, but these are used only at formal ceremonies. When they are older, children get ox-names. A girl may choose an ox-name from the bull calf of a cow she milks; the name is used by her female age-group friends. A boy is given an ox during his initiation ceremony and he acquires that ox-name; his male age-group friends may use his ox-name instead of his personal name.<sup>69</sup>

### Gender Differences in Speech

In many societies the speech of men differs from the speech of women. The variation can be slight, as in our own society, or more extreme, as with the Carib Indians (in the Lesser Antilles of the West Indies), among whom women and men use different words for the same concepts.<sup>70</sup> In Japan, males and females use entirely different words for numerous concepts (for example, the male word for water is *mizu*, the female version is *ohiya*), and females often add the polite prefix  $o$ - (females will tend to say ohasi for chopsticks; males will tend to say hasi).71 In the United States and in other Western societies, there are differences in the speech of females and males, but they are not as dramatic as in the Carib and Japanese cases. For example, in the preceding section we noted the tendency for the g to be dropped in words such as *singing* when the situation is informal and when the social class background is lower. But there is also a gender difference—women are more likely than men to keep the g sound and less likely than men to drop the  $h$  in words such as *happy*. In Montreal, women are less likely than men to drop the  $l$ in phrases such as *il fait* ("he does") or in the idiom  $il \ y \ a \ (\text{``there is/are''}).$ 

Gender differences occur in intonation and in phrasing of sentences as well. Robin Lakoff found that in English women tend to answer questions with sentences that have rising inflections at the end instead of a falling intonation associated with a firm answer. Women also tend to add questions to statements, such as "They caught the robber last week, didn't they?"72

"Davis, you're fired—are you O.K. with that? (Reprinted courtesy of Mankoff/The Cartoon Bank.)

One explanation for the gender differences, particularly with regard to pronunciation, is that women in many societies may be more concerned than men with being "correct."73 (Not in the linguist's sense; it is important to remember that linguists do not consider one form of speech more correct than another, just as they do not consider one dialect superior to another—all are equally capable of expressing a complex variety of thoughts and ideas.) In societies with social classes, what is considered more correct by the average person may be what is associated with the upper class. In other societies, what is older may be considered more correct. For example, in the Native American language of Koasati (which used to be spoken in Louisiana), males and females used different endings in certain verbs. The differences seemed to be disappearing in the 1930s, when the research on Koasati was done: young girls used the male forms and only older women used the female forms. Koasati men said that the women's speech was a "better" form of speech.<sup>74</sup> Gender differences in speech may parallel some of the gender differences noted in other social behavior (as we will see in the chapter on sex, gender, and culture): girls are more likely than boys to behave in ways that are acceptable to adults.

There are not enough studies to know just how common it is for women to exhibit more linguistic "correctness." We do know of some instances where it is not the case. For example, in a community in Madagascar where people speak Merina, a dialect of Malagasy, it is considered socially correct to avoid explicit directives. So instead of directly ordering an action, a Merina-speaker will try to say it indirectly. Also, it is polite to avoid negative remarks, such as expressing anger toward someone else. In this community, however, it is women, not men, who often break the rules; women speak more directly and express anger more often.<sup>75</sup> This differ**New Perspectives on Gender** 

#### DOES THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROMOTE SEXIST THINKING?

L\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Does English promote sexist thinking? Or does the language merely reflect the gender inequalities that already exist? For those who wish to promote gender equality, the answers to these questions are important because if language influences thoughts (along the lines put forward by Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf), then linguistic change will be necessary in order to bring about change in the culture of gender. If it is the other way around, that is, if language reflects inequality, then social, economic, and political changes have to come before we can expect substantial linguistic change to occur.

Leaving aside for the moment which changes first, how does English represent gender inequity? Consider the following written by Benjamin Lee Whorf: "Speech is the best show man puts on. . . . Language helps man in his thinking." While man

in English technically refers to humans and his technically refers to a single person's thinking (of either gender), the frequent use of such words plausibly could convey that males are more important. Similarly, do the words chairman, policeman, businessman, salesman convey that males are supposed to have those jobs? What is conveyed when there are two words for the two genders? Actor and actress. Hero and heroine. Usually the base word is male and the suffix is added for the female form. Does the suffix convey that the female form is an afterthought or less important?

It is not just the structure of the language that may convey gender inequity. There are also differences in usage and metaphor. Although there is a female and male form for someone who has lost a spouse (widow and widower), many people will say "Sally is Henry's widow" but

hardly anyone would say "Henry is Sally's widower." Why? Is it considered more important that a woman was formerly attached to a man than that a man was formerly attached to a woman? Given this usage, it is not surprising that widow (the female form) is the basic term in this case, *widower* (the male form) the derived term. And how come in the pairs sir/madam, master/mistress, wizard/witch, the female version has acquired negative connotations? Why are so many animal images applied to women? They may be described as chicks, hen-peckers, cows, dogs, bitches, kittens, and birds.

Coming back to the original questions, how would we know whether language promotes sexism or sexism influences language? One way to find out is to do experimental studies, such as the one conducted by Fatemeh Khosroshashi. Some individuals were asked to read texts written

COMM.

ence may be related to the fact that women are more involved in buying and selling in the marketplace.

Some researchers have questioned whether it is correctness that is at issue. Rather, we may be dealing in these examples with unequal prestige and power. Women may try to raise their status by conforming more to standard speech. When they answer a question with a rising inflection, they may be expressing uncertainty and a lack of power. Alternatively, perhaps women want to be more cooperative conversationalists. Speaking in a more "standard" fashion is consistent with being more likely to be understood by others. Answering a question with another question leads to continued conversation.<sup>76</sup>

#### Multilingualism and Codeswitching

For many people in the world the ability to speak more than one language is a normal part of life. One language may be spoken at home, another in school, the marketplace, or in government. Or more than one language may be spoken at home if family members come from different cultures and still other languages are spoken outside. Some countries

with man and he and his referring to people; others were asked to read texts with more genderneutral phrasing. Individuals were subsequently asked to draw pictures to go with the texts—the ones who read the texts with more "male" terminology drew more accompanying pictures of men, strongly suggesting that the use of the terms *man*, he, and his conveyed the thought that the people in the text were men, not women, because of the vocabulary used. We need many more such studies to help address the intellectual question of which comes first, linguistic or nonlinguistic culture.

It would be important to know whether societies with more "male-oriented" language are more male-dominated than are societies without such distinctions. We don't have that kind of comparative research yet. But one study by Robert and Ruth Munroe looked at the proportion of female and male nouns in ten languages (six

Indo-European; four non-European) in which nouns have "gender." Although none of those societies could be described as having "female-bias," the Munroes were able to ask whether those societies with less malebias in social customs (for example, all children are equally likely to inherit property) have a higher proportion of female nouns than male nouns (more female than male nouns). The answer appears to be yes. While this study does not reveal what came first, studies like it are important if we want to discover how language differences may be related to other aspects of culture. If male-oriented languages are not related to male dominance, then it is not likely that *sexist* thinking is a consequence of language.

On the assumption that language may influence thought, many are pushing for changes in the way English is used, if not structured. It is hard to get English speakers to adopt a gender-neutral singular pronoun to replace he. Attempts to do so go back to the eighteenth century and include suggestions of tey, thon, per, and s/he. Although these attempts have not succeeded, the way English is written and spoken has begun to change. Words or phrases such as chair (or chairperson), police *officer, sales assistant (salesperson)* have begun to replace their former-man versions. If Whorf were writing his sentence now it probably would be written "Speech is the best show humans put on. . . . Language helps people think."

explicitly promote multilingualism. For example, Singapore has four official languages-English, Mandarin (one of the Chinese languages), Tamil, and Malay. English is stressed for trade, Mandarin as the language of communication with most of China, Malay as the language of the general region, and Tamil as the language of an important ethnic group. Moreover, most of the population speak Hokkien, another Chinese language. Education is likely to be in English and Mandarin.<sup>77</sup>

What happens when people who know two or more languages communicate with each other?

Very often you find them **codeswitching**, using more than one language in the course of conversing.<sup>78</sup> Switching can occur in the middle of a Spanish-English bilingual sentence, as in "No van a bring it up in the meeting" ("They are not going to bring it up in the meeting").<sup>79</sup> Or switching can occur when the topic or situation changes, such as from social talk to schoolwork. Why do speakers of more than one language sometimes switch? Although speakers switch for a lot of different reasons, what is clear is that the switching is not a haphazard mix that comes from laziness or ignorancecodeswitching involves a great deal of knowledge of two or more languages and an awareness of what is considered appropriate or inappropriate in the community. For example, in the Puerto Rican community in New York City, codeswitching within the same sentence seems to be common in speech among friends, but if a stranger who looks like a Spanish speaker approaches, the language will shift entirely to Spanish.<sup>80</sup>

Although each community may have its own "rules" for codeswitching, variations in practice may need to be understood in terms of the broader political and historical context. For example, German speakers in Transylvania, where Romanian is the national language, hardly ever codeswitch to Romanian. Perhaps the reason is that, before the end of World War II, German speakers were a privileged economic group who looked down upon landless Romanians and their language. During socialism the German speakers lost their economic privilege, but they continued to speak German among themselves. In the rare cases that Romanian is used among German speakers it tends to be associated with "low-status" speech, such as singing bawdy songs. The opposite situation occurred in a Hungarian region of German-speaking Austria. The people of this agricultural region annexed to Austria in 1921 were fairly poor peasant farmers. After World War II, business expansion began to attract labor from rural areas, so many Hungarians eagerly moved into jobs in industry. German was seen by the younger generations as a symbol of higher status and upward mobility; not surprisingly, codeswitching between Hungarian and German became part of their conversations. Indeed in the third generation, German has become the language of choice, except when speaking to the oldest Hungarians. The Hungarian-Austrian situation is fairly common in many parts of the world, where the language of the politically dominant group ends up being "linguistically dominant."81

# Interethnic Communication

Even when they speak the same language, people from different ethnic groups may have some misunderstandings in communication because of the different unconscious rules they have about how to have a conversation. For example, English-speaking Athapaskan Indians in Canada seem to think that conversation with a white Canadian should be avoided except when they think they know the point of view of the white (who is generally more powerful politically). On the other hand, white English speakers think they should use conversation to get to know others (as at a cocktail party). So they pause a certain amount of time to let the other person talk, but they pause a much shorter time than an Athapaskan English speaker would. If the other person doesn't respond, the white English speaker, feeling awkward, will say something else. By the time an Athapaskan Indian is ready to talk, the white is already talking and the Athapaskan Indian considers it impolite to interrupt. It is easy to see how whites and Athapaskan Indians can misunderstand each other. Athapaskan Indians think white English speakers talk too much and don't let Indians express their views, and whites think Athapaskan Indians do not want to talk or get to know whites.<sup>82</sup>

The field of sociolinguistics is a relatively new specialty in linguistics. At present, sociolinguists seem to be interested primarily in describing variation in the use of language. Eventually, however, sociolinguistic research may enable us to understand why such variation exists. Why, for example, do some societies use many different status terms in address? Why do some societies use modes of speaking that vary with the sex of the speaker? An understanding of why language varies in different contexts might also suggest why structural aspects of language change over time. For as social contexts in a society change, the structure of the language might also tend to change.

# V SUMMARY

1. The essential function language plays in all societies is that of communication. Although human communication is not limited to spoken language, such language is of overriding importance because it is the primary vehicle through which culture is shared and transmitted.

2. Systems of communication are not unique to humans. Other animal species communicate in a variety of ways-by sound, odor, body movement, and so forth. The ability of chimpanzees and gorillas to learn and use sign language suggests that symbolic communication is not unique to hu-
