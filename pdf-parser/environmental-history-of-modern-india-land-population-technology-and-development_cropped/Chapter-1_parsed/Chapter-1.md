# INTRODUCTION

Two hundred and twenty-four years ago, in 1798, Thomas Robert Malthus visualised that the population will grow geometrically twofold in every twenty-five years, and food production will grow only in arithmetic proportion that would result in famine and starvation. In other words, Malthus emphasised over two centuries ago that population control is important even when the population at the global level was not at all a problem. According to Malthus, 'Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio. Subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio.'1 The global population growth was very low and it seems that it took several centuries to reach the onebillion mark.<sup>2</sup> According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, until the early nineteenth century, the global population was less than 0.8 billion. In the subsequent years, the population has increased gradually and took about 100 years to reach two billion.<sup>3</sup> Since then, the global population growth has increased remarkably. Since the mid-twentieth century, the world population has increased remarkably from 2.54 billion in 1950 to 6.15 billion in 2000, and it is expected to grow to 9.77 billion in 2050 and 11.18 billion in 2100.4 In other words, 83 million are added every year, which indicates a 1.1 per cent growth rate per year.

Due to the population growth, more areas were brought under cultivation and the total cultivated area has increased manyfold during the last three centuries. According to Goldewijk et al. (2010), the total cropland area has increased more than fivefold, i.e., 3 million square kilometres to 15.32 million square kilometres during the last three centuries.<sup>5</sup> From AD 1 to AD 2000, various estimates of the cropland at the global level show that they have increased remarkably. These estimates further indicate that from AD 1 to AD 1400, 1.9 to 2.3 million square kilometres of land was classified as cropland. In other words, over the fourteen centuries, the cropland has increased only marginally. Beginning with the eighteenth to nineteenth centuries, the cropland has increased gradually from 2.7–4.1 million square kilometres in 1700 to 4.0–6.8 million square kilometres in 1800, according to different estimates.<sup>6</sup>

Since the mid-nineteenth century, the cropland has increased remarkably (Table 1.1). In fact, croplands have increased two to three folds within one and a half centuries (1850–2000). Until the fourteenth century, less than 2 per cent of the world's total geographical area comprised croplands which has increased marginally in the subsequent

# 2 *Environmental History of Modern India*

four centuries to 2.9 per cent. Since the mid-nineteenth century until the twentieth century, the cropland area has increased more than twofold. The pastoral land also varied until the fourteenth century and has marginally increased till the mid-nineteenth century. Thereafter, it has increased four to five folds in the subsequent one and a half centuries. Precisely, both croplands and pastoral lands were very negligible until the fourteenth century and have only marginally increased in the midnineteenth century and in the subsequent one and half centuries they increased several folds (Table 1.1).

The increasing trend of croplands and pastoral lands indicates that more than fourfold common property resources have been brought under cultivation. The world population has increased gradually from 1800 to 1900 and after that there was a phenomenal growth, whereas deforestation occurred gradually from the early nineteenth century at the global level. This trend was depicted in Figure 1.1 which will give us a clear picture regarding the population growth and deforestation over two centuries at the global level.

Growing population has a direct impact on forests and the environment. When the population growth was low, deforestation was also low and as the population increased, deforestation has also increased. However, in the early days, people have used forest resources only to a limited extent. 'People began converting forests to other land uses—using fire, primitive tools and grazing—thousands of years ago to facilitate hunting and agriculture.'8 Consequently, there was no serious threat for the forest resources. According to Michael Williams:

[T]he long-held view has been that prehistoric peoples were a nonfactor in environmental change and degradation. Their number and densities were too low to bring about significant change; their technology was insufficient to cause alteration; and their livelihood (particularly that of non-Western 'primitive' peoples) was in perfect harmony with nature.<sup>9</sup>

State of the World's Forests Report 2012 mentions:

Conservation of forests formed an integral part of the Vedic tradition of India: as early as 300 bce, the Maurya kingdom recognized the importance of forests, and the first emperor of the dynasty, Chandragupta, appointed an officer to look after the forests. The concept of sacred groves is deeply ingrained in Indian religious beliefs, and thousands of such protected areas still conserve trees and biodiversity.<sup>10</sup>

However, population increase had led to an increased demand for cropland and grazing pastures over the period. According to FAO:

Some estimates suggest that global forest area has decreased by around 1.8 billion hectares in the past 5000 years (a decline equivalent to nearly 50 percent of the total forest area today). Archaeological and historical evidence indicates that much of this forest loss was associated with population increase and demand for land for crops and grazing, as well as with unsustainable levels of exploitation of forest resources.<sup>11</sup>

Population growth and deforestation occurred in different countries at different points of time. For example, in China, forest cover has declined rapidly over the past few centuries. 'Four thousand years ago, the population of China was about 1.4 million people, and forests covered more than 60 percent of the land area. By 1840, China's population had reached 413 million and forest cover had declined to 17 percent.<sup>112</sup> In addition to the population growth, colonisation has also made serious impact on the forest. For example, the forest cover declined in South Asia over several centuries and it was further accentuated due to the colonisation process. State of the World's Forests Report 2016 states:

The forests of southern Asia were also converted to agricultural land to support the rapidly expanding population in that region. It is likely that the forest area in southern Asia has declined by more than half in the last 500 years. There, as elsewhere, colonization had an impact on forests, with the European colonizers heavily exploiting timber for use in other parts of the world. […] In the Americas, there is evidence that native cultures systematically used fire to convert forest areas for crop-growing or as a wildlife management tool. Large-scale forest conversion in the North American continent began, however, with the arrival of Europeans in the late fifteenth century. The rate of forest conversion rose sharply as the human population grew; on the other hand, the push westward by settlers in the nineteenth century led to forest re-growth on abandoned agricultural land in the east. In Central and South America, forest cover was probably about 75 percent of the land area before the arrival of Europeans; deforestation in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries reduced this to about 70 percent by the early twentieth century.<sup>13</sup>

Historically different countries experienced deforestation either due to population or colonisation or both at different points of time.

Due to the population growth, the vegetated lands are converted for the croplands and pastoral lands and it has impacted the ecology and environment. William points out in *Deforesting the Earth* that:

As the forest changed, so the humans colonized the newly vegetated land with remarkable rapidity, doing all those things that humans do: foraging, firing, hunting, selecting species and rejecting others, turning the soil, fertilizing it, trampling it, and mixing it. In the course of manipulation, of the biota some tree taxa moved, flourished, or were eliminated, just as surely as if they had been affected by changing climate.14

This impact was much more severe after the industrialisation and technological advancement. Williams further states that the industrialisation, mechanisation, power; population growth and migration, colonisation and improvements in transportation and communication are the major driving forces for the deforestation process across the world from the eighteenth century onwards.15

After the Second World War, majority of the colonised countries got freedom. However, these countries continued to follow the same old colonial forest policies. 'Although colonialism was largely dismantled in the aftermath of the Second World War, the forest policies of many newly independent countries in the tropics continued to reflect its legacy.'16 'Today, humankind has greater technological capacity than ever before to bring about rapid land–use change on a very large scale.'17 At the same time, several countries have experienced either stable or

an increase in the forest cover during the second half of the twentieth century. The State of the World's Forests Report 2016 also states that:

Forest area has been stable in North America since the early twentieth century, following two centuries of deforestation. Although forest cover in China had fallen to a historical low of less than 10 percent of the land area by 1949, it had recovered to nearly 20 percent of the land area by the end of the twentieth century as a result of major reforestation and afforestation programmes.18

Since the early nineteenth century, the population has increased marginally but deforestation occurred much more rapidly during the same period. In other words, in little more than two centuries, about one billion hectares of deforestation has occurred.19 It seems that until the mid-twentieth century, the deforestation of the temperate forest was high and after that, deforestation of tropical forest has increased rapidly.20

Decline of the forest area was also rampant in recent years, particularly from the last decade of the twentieth century to first one and a half decades of the early twenty-first centuries<sup>21</sup> (Table 1.2). 'In 1990 the world had 4,128 million ha of forest; by 2015 this area had decreased to 3,999 million ha. Thus, there is a considerable change from 31.6 percent of global land area in 1990 to 30.6 percent in 2015.'22 FAO states:

Over the past 25 years the world's forest area has declined from 4.1 billion ha to just under 4 billion ha, a decrease of 3.1 percent. The rate of global forest area net loss has slowed by more than 50 percent between the periods of 1990–2000 and 2010–2015.23

#### *Introduction* 7

According to the FAO, within fifteen years (1980–1995), the net decline in forest cover was about 180 million acres. However, this trend was not common among the different regions. It seems that the declining trend was mainly confined to developing countries as against the developed countries which were showing a net increase within the fifteen years.<sup>24</sup> However, the forest area has declined at the global level in recent decades. 'The geographical distribution of deforestation has changed in the twentieth century, but its major driver continued to be the expansion of agricultural land, facilitated by greater mechanization. Other drivers included urban expansion, infrastructure development and mining.'25

In recent decades, deforestation is happening in the developing countries due to various development activities. According to State of the World's Forests Report 2016:

There was a net forest loss of 7 million hectares per year in tropical countries in the period 2000–2010 and a net gain in agricultural land of 6 million hectares per year. The greatest net loss of forests and net gain in agricultural land over the period was in the low-income group of countries, where the rural population is ever growing. Large-scale commercial agriculture accounts for about 40 percent of deforestation in the tropics and subtropics, local subsistence agriculture for 33 percent, infrastructure for 10 percent, urban expansion for 10 percent and mining for 7 percent.<sup>26</sup>

At the same time, the deforestation has declined in the developed countries. In fact, more areas were brought under the forest cover. FAO also mentions:

In western Europe, deforestation rates declined as a result of several factors such as: improvements in the productivity of existing agricultural land; the consideration that remaining forest lands were less suitable for farming; industrialization and associated urbanization; an increase in timber imports from other parts of the world; and the replacement of wood by coal as the main source of fuel. By the end of the twentieth century the forest area in most of Europe was stable or increasing, with forests covering around onethird of the total land area.27,28

The earth has about 133 million square kilometres of land which is not covered by rock, sand or ice. Till 8000 bc, the population in the world was about 5–20 million; the total land area comprised forest and woodland was 65 million square kilometres, grassland was

about 63 million square kilometres and there were no pastoral lands. It seems that till AD 1700, the population has increased to over 680 million and the pasture and cropland emerged largely at the cost of the forest and woodland. Since then, the population has increased progressively and the pasture and cropland has also increased in the same manner. For instance, the total population was about 1.2 billion in 1850 and the pasture land and cropland has increased to 8 million square kilometres and 5.4 million square kilometres respectively, while the forest and woodland and grassland have also increased during this period. In the subsequent century, i.e., in 1950, the population has increased to 2.5 billion and the pastoral and cropland have also increased to 23 million square kilometres and 11.7 million square kilometres respectively whereas the forest and woodlands and grasslands have declined from 60 million square kilometres each to 54 and 45 million square kilometres respectively within hundred years (Table 1.2). In the subsequent four decades, population has increased from 2.5 billion to 5.3 billion and pastoral lands and croplands have increased to 34 and 15.2 million square kilometres while the forest and woodlands and grasslands have declined to 48 and 36 million square kilometres for the same period (Table 1.2). At the global level too, population is increasing, which has resulted in increase of pastoral lands and croplands while the forests and woodlands and grasslands have declined more or less in the same proportion.

It is not that merely population increased but even the pastoral lands and croplands have also increased simultaneously over the centuries, but all these had main implications for biodiversity, ecology and environment. It seems that since the early twentieth century, about 1 per cent of the birds and mammal species have gone into extinction and many more have become endangered.<sup>30</sup> McNeill further predicted that the threat to the biodiversity resources was to be much more serious in the subsequent decades.

### *URBANISATION*

At the global level, urbanisation was very low until the early nineteenth century. In 1800, only 3 per cent of the population lived in the urban areas. Since the early twentieth century, urbanisation has increased tremendously at the global level. In 1900, only 0.22 billion people lived in the urban areas. Since the mid-twentieth century, urban population has increased at the global level from 0.75 billion in 1950 to 2.87 billion in 2000 and it is projected to grow to 6.68 billion in 2050.<sup>31</sup> In other words, in 1900, only about 13 per cent of the population has lived in

the urban areas and it has increased to 29.53 per cent in 1950 and it has increased further to 46.67 per cent in 2000 and it is expected to increase even more to 68.37 per cent in 2050 (Table 1.3).

#### *WATER*

Until the twentieth century, the demand for water was determined mainly by the population. People used water for food production and domestic use. Since the onset of the twentieth century, industrial consumption of freshwater gradually increased.<sup>33</sup> From 1700 to 1900, the global freshwater withdrawal has increased from 110 cubic kilometre. In other words, global freshwater withdrawal has increased more than fivefold. From the eighteenth century until the beginning of the twentieth century, the per capita freshwater use has increased from 170 cubic metre to 360 cubic metre. In other words, the per capita freshwater has increased more than twofold within two centuries. During these two centuries, about 90 per cent of the water was used for irrigation and the rest of the 10 per cent was used for industry, municipal and other uses (Table 1.4). Similarly, until the twentieth century, freshwater withdrawal was limited and largely used for irrigation and other purposes, viz., industry and municipal uses were very limited.

Since the early twentieth century, freshwater withdrawal has increased from 580 cubic kilometre in 1900 to 1382 cubic kilometre in 1950 and 3,973 cubic kilometre in 2000. Till 1950, withdrawal of freshwater has increased more than twofold and the per capita use has increased more than one and half folds from 360 cubic metre in 1900 to 550 cubic metre in 1950. During this period, the share of irrigation has declined and industry began to gain a larger share.

In the second half of the twentieth century, freshwater withdrawal has increased nearly threefold and per capita withdrawal has also increased to nearly one-fourth. During this period, the share of irrigation

has come down from 83 per cent to 64 per cent, while industry and municipal shares have increased from 13 per cent and 4 per cent to 25 per cent and 9 per cent respectively for the same period.

With the increasing the demand for water among different sectors, water pollution further aggravated the water problem significantly in different parts of the world. According to World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP) 2017, 'An estimated 80% of all industrial and municipal waste water are released to the environment without any prior treatment, resulting in a growing deterioration of overall water quality with detrimental impacts on human health and ecosystems.'35 'Over the past several decades, ever-growing demands for—and misuse of—water resources have increased the risks of pollution and severe water stress in many parts of the world.'36

Fifty-four years ago, Garrett Hardin (1968) predicted that 'the tragedy of the commons' can be averted since 'no technical solution can rescue us from the misery of overpopulation', 'the only way we can preserve and nurture other and more precious freedoms is by relinquishing the freedom to breed, and that very soon.<sup>37</sup> In other words, 'the population problem has no technical solution; it requires a fundamental extension in morality.<sup>38</sup>

The importance of controlling population growth was emphasised by Malthus more than two centuries back. He cautioned us how it will be difficult to meet the livelihood demands. After about one and half centuries, Hardin in 1968, has cautioned us to reduce the population not by compulsion but by enlightening the people to reduce the fertility to protect both the ecology and environment. Malthus has cautioned us to control the population when there was no evidential threat of population explosion and similarly, Hardin too has cautioned us to control the growth of population from an environmental point of view.
## *IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT*

When the population was low in the Indian subcontinent, extraction of the forest resources or exchange of forest resources was the main agenda of the colonial powers from the early sixteenth century. For example, Vasco da Gama started his expedition from Lisbon in 1497 and reached the city of Calicut on 20 May 1498. He stayed nearly for six months and returned to Europe. While returning, he carried a letter from the Raja of Calicut (Zamorin) to the King of Portugal. The letter said:

Vasco da Gama, a nobleman of your household, has visited my kingdom and has given me great pleasure. In my kingdom there is abundance of cinnamon, cloves, ginger, pepper, and precious stones. What I seek from thy country is gold, silver, coral, and scarlet.<sup>39</sup>

Since the early sixteenth century, forest resources have been extracted for commercial purposes. As such, till the mid-eighteenth century, the local people were not responsible for deforestation but instead, it occurred due to colonial commercialisation.

Before the mid-eighteenth century, the population of Indian subcontinent was 'too few people rather than too many.'40 In fact, till the mid-nineteenth century, there was no question of over population in the Indian subcontinent.<sup>41</sup> Migration rate was also very low and that has not influenced much the demographic features of the Indian subcontinent.42 Forbiddance of widow remarriage was also one of the factors for the low population growth among the Hindus.<sup>43</sup> Whereas Muslims has the tolerance of widow remarriage that led to higher population growth in India.44 According to Davis, 'rapid and massive population growth—has no purely political solution. With density already great and living standards low, a continued increase in numbers means continued tragedy.'45

Findlay Shirras (1933) argues that: 'The population of India has been of gradual growth, and it was only in the latter half of the nineteenth century, owing to increased economic development, railways, irrigation works, industries and trade, that population increased more rapidly than hitherto.'46 Shirras estimated that 'India's population about 1650 at 80,000,000, and about 1750 at 130,000,000. The figure for 1850 is of the order of 190,000,000.'47 She attributed that 'large economic development brought about by the extension of railways, irrigation, commerce and industry towards the end of last century.'48

'Clearing new lands for the plough was the most common form of investment in agriculture in the colonial period. Irrigation works leading to land reclamation were another. The result was steady conversion

of forests, woodlands, grasslands, and desert into arable tracts.'49 'Vegetation cover has moved down the scale of abundance: from forest to woodlands; from woodland to scrub; from scrub to grasslands; from grasslands to barren areas. Simultaneously, cultivated lands have made large absolute and relative gains.'50

Since the mid-twentieth century, population explosion and technological advancement resulted in a threat to natural resources, invariably in different parts of the world. Indeed, the ramification of depletion of natural resources was rampant in the developing countries due to rapid population growth, particularly since the later part of the twentieth century. In most of the developing countries, the infant mortality rate has declined while the longevity of life has increased. Consequently, the pressure on natural resources has increased several folds in most of the developing countries. For instance, at the time of Independence, India's population was around 30 crores and it has increased to 121 crores in 2011. At the same time, the infant mortality rate has declined from 165 to 34 and longevity has increased from 45 to 67 per 1,000 for the same period. This is due to development of health infrastructural facilities as well as other intervention mechanisms during the post-Independence period. Consequently, we have to harness more and more natural resources to feed the mass as well as to provide infrastructural facilities.

In every country, land resources are finite. Then the question arises as to how to ensure that the needs of increasing population be met within the given geographical area. Obviously, increasing productivity is an important aspect; either by bringing more area under cultivation or by adopting new technologies to increase productivity. The latter one only enables to increase the productivity factors marginally. Hence, more area has to be brought under the ambit of cultivation. Given the limited land resources, other inputs have to be employed to increase the productivity factors, such as irrigation, fertilisers, highyielding varieties and other technical inputs. Irrigation is an important component for the production process but its availability is limited and uncertain. Hence, water was stored in lakes, tanks, ponds, etc. Several dams have been constructed across rivers and their tributaries to expand the irrigation facilities during the post-Independence period without realising the need to maintain the natural flow. Consequently, every basin/sub-basin became a closed basin. Hence, water conflict became a common phenomenon invariably between head reach and tail-end within a basin, between basins, within a state, between states and finally between countries. None of the river basins are exempted from water conflict. For details, see Saravanan (2000).

## *Introduction* 13

Adding to the water scarcity, water pollution aggravated the problem further. The villages or towns used to discharge waste water into streams and rivers which resulted in water pollution not only of surface water but also of groundwater. Of course, in villages, it did not make serious impact on the environment due to its limited quantity, and its flow was confined to a very short distance. Whereas in cities and towns, discharge of huge quantity of waste water, resulting in the pollution of both surface and groundwater, further added to the water woes.

Since the early nineteenth century, the East India Company (EIC) gave priority to establish the large dams while it failed to maintain small water bodies like tanks, ponds, etc. Consequently, both supply side channels and distributive channels have been encroached invariably in different parts of the country. In addition to that, groundwater was also extracted and reached a zero point in many parts of the country due to the bore-well technology since the last quarter of the twentieth century.

Consequently, drinking water problem is a perennial problem not only in the urban areas but also in rural areas. Cities and towns are diverting water from distant places. For example, Madras city is getting water from the Krishna River originating from Andhra Pradesh, which is at a distance of about 600 kilometres. It is also getting water from Hogenakkal and Veeranam tank which are about 200 kilometres away from Madras city. The freshwater is diverted from distant places and is used/polluted and discharged as sewage. Only a limited quantity of sewage water was treated. For example, Yamuna River, on whose bank Delhi, the national capital, is located, has become a highly polluted river. It is polluted because only about 20 per cent of the sewage water was treated through two treatment plants and the rest of the sewage water was going directly to the Yamuna River. This is the case in most of the cities/towns in this country. Given the background, this book attempts to capture the comprehensive environmental history, engaging the complexity of the issues and problems for the contemporary India from the early nineteenth century to the early twenty-first century in a historical context.

## *SYNOPTIC VIEW OF THE CHAPTERS*

This book consists of nine chapters. The first chapter sets the argument in motion and gives detailed outlines of the book. The second chapter analyses the trend of land-use pattern and its implications for the ecology and environment in India at the macro level for different states. Land is one of the important factors of production, and it also ensures both ecological and environmental sustainability. Land became a scarce

resource due to population explosion that demanded more production as well as various infrastructural developments, such as power, road, housing, drinking water, education, medical care, etc. Since Independence, the population of India has increased nearly fourfold. Consequently, the demand for food security and infrastructural facilities has also increased remarkably and that has led to mounting pressure on land-use patterns. To ensure food security for the increasing population, uncultivable land was brought under cultivation and private land as well as common property resources have been exploited to provide the various infrastructural facilities. The second chapter also attempts to analyse the consequences of population pressure on the land and other common property resources during the post-Independence period.

The third chapter attempts to explore the issue of population growth and its consequences for environment from the late eighteenth to the early twenty-first centuries, consisting of the precolonial, colonial and post-Independence period. During the precolonial period, the population density was not only very low but also was low in terms of lack of migration, urbanisation, slums, food security, agricultural expansion and other infrastructural facilities. In other words, people lived on subsistence level. During the colonial period, the population density did not increase due to frequent famines, drought and lack of health infrastructural facilities. Till the last phase of colonial period, i.e., 1947, death rate, infant mortality rate and the longevity factors were also very low. Consequently, the population growth remained the same during the most part of the colonial period. For example, the population growth marginally increased over the fifty-year period from 23 crores in 1871 to 25 crores in 1921. However, after Independence, population growth has been remarkable. The population figures have increased fourfold within six decades from 36 crores in 1951 to 121 crores in 2011. This population explosion resulted in severe and massive exploitation of natural resources during the post-Independence period. Precisely, how the population explosion has impacted on the land-use pattern and what was its consequences on the ecology and environment are captured in this chapter.

The focal point of the fourth chapter is to analyse the colonial projects and their impacts on the ecology and environment in India during the colonial era in a historical perspective (1800–1947). It argues that the focus of the colonial policy on various sectors of the economy has paved the way for ecological and environmental destruction in different parts of the Indian subcontinent, spread over a time frame of one and a half centuries. Further, it also argues that the colonial policies were not designed to protect the ecological and environmental resources and, instead, they have been systematically framed to disintegrate

the traditional institutional structure as well other societies and its communities, in order to exploit natural resources. Over the one and a half years of colonial era, the policy initiatives and enactments of various acts and laws may pose as if that they were brought into force to protect natural resources but in reality, they were designed to extract natural resources in a much more systematic manner leading to serious impact on the ecology and environment in different parts of the county at different points of time. This chapter seeks to argue that the colonial policies and their initiatives have ignored to accord due importance to the protection of natural resources as it was mainly concerned about the exploitation of these resources that gradually led to serious impact on the ecology and environment of the Indian subcontinent.

The fifth chapter attempts to analyse post-Independent India's environmental history for the last seven decades, in a historical perspective (1947–2017). It raises an important question whether the postcolonial government policies have changed in favour of environmental protection or continued in the line of the same old colonial legacy. This chapter consists of nine sections. The first section analyses the trends of green cover that encompass forestry, pastoral land and other culturable waste, and the factors that influenced the depletion of green cover during the post-Independence period. The second section deals the impact of green revolution resulting in the increase of area under cultivation, irrigation expansion—dams and wells—decline of soil fertility due to chemical fertilisers and pesticides, and other related issues. The third section analyses the trends of urbanisation and their consequences on environment not only in terms of area and population but also on a wide range of household amenities and increasing slum dwellings. It also discusses the policies and their impact on urban environment. The fourth section analyses the increasing trend of water demand among different stakeholders and how it was managed, and the environmental consequences that occurred during the post-Independence period. The fifth section analyses the trends in industrial growth and their implications for the environment during the post-Independence period. From the environmental point of view, there are two types of industries—water-polluting industries and airpolluting industries. The former one includes tanneries, dyeing and bleaching, pharmaceutical industries, etc. These industries are polluting both surface and groundwater sources. The latter includes cement, coal, power plant, etc., polluting the air. This section analyses the trend of expanding wide range of industries and their implications for the environment during the post-Independence period. The sixth section analyses the trend of growing number of vehicles and its impact on the environment. It also looks into the quality of air- and water-related issues.

The seventh section deals with various policy initiatives taken by the government to protect the environment during the post-Independence period. The eighth section analyses the political economy of post-Independent India's government policies and their consequences for the environment. The last section ends with concluding observations of the chapter.

The sixth chapter analyses the issues related to acquisition of private land for the various development purposes from the early nineteenth century to the early twenty-first century in a legal–historical perspective. Land acquisition for public purpose is not only a threat to the livelihood options of the private land owners and farmers but also to the ecology and environment. Since the early nineteenth century, a separate act was enacted at the Presidency level to acquire land for the public purposes. In the mid-nineteenth century, i.e., 1857, a common act was enacted for the country as a whole. Land Acquisition Act, 1894, was a comprehensive one which was extensively used to acquire land for various development activities. During the colonial and the post-Independence period, several amendments were made in this act, resulting in serious consequence not only for the private land but has also impacted on common property resources. This has become a somber threat not only for the farmer livelihood options but also to the ecologically and environmentally important common property resources. At the same time, there is no government policy for rehabilitation and resettlement of the displaced people. This has resulted in farmers to forego their assets without any alternative livelihood options. This chapter, therefore, argues as to how land acquisition policies have affected the livelihood options of the farmers without appropriate rehabilitation and resettlement policies, and how it has endangered both the ecology and environment in a historical context for about two centuries, from the early nineteenth century to the early twenty-first century (1824–2013).

The seventh chapter attempts to analyse the generation of electronic waste in India and its consequences for environment during the post-Independence period, particularly during the last three decades. The electrical and electronic equipment has undergone a tremendous change since the last quarter of the twentieth century. During the 1980s, the government policy has encouraged the white goods that have led to tremendous growth of consumer appliances, such as washing machines, refrigerators, television, etc. Since the early 1990s, the government gave priority for the information and communication technologies that have led to the growth of computers, mobile phones, electronic gadgets, etc. In addition to this, technological advancement in the electrical and electronic equipment has led to disposal of the old models. On the one hand, end life of the electrical and electronics products is short and, on the other hand, the spurt of technological innovation has led to disposal of the old products. At the same time, no serious measures have been initiated to control/manage the generation of electronic waste by the government. Whatever little measures were initiated by the government have not made any serious impact in either control or management of the waste. It resulted in posing great threat to natural resources and public health in new circumstances. Given the scenario, the chapter attempts to analyse the nature and trends of electronic waste in India and their impact on environment during the last three decades.

The eighth chapter discusses the complexity of conflict between land, population, environment and development in a historical perspective. Unlike other countries, India's land resources were controlled by certain communities and historically, nearly one-fifth of the Scheduled Castes (SCs) do not have any land. The landless people and those who are living in the forests constituted about one-fourth of the Indian subcontinent's population. Of course, many other communities also do not own land. This chapter is divided into eighth sections. The first section deals with the landless communities and their living conditions. The second section analyses the peoples living in the forests and the impact of conservation initiatives on their livelihoods. The third section deals with the trend of landholding pattern. The fourth section analyses the various developmental projects that have displaced the people from their land and the initiatives taken to compensate and rehabilitate them. The fifth section analyses as to how the forest land was diverted for enforcing the various development measures. The sixth section deals with the role played by political economy, especially its impact on landless people, tribals and those who have lost their lands due to various development projects. The seventh section deals with the population, environment and development aspects of the people addressed during the post-Independence period and the last section ends with concluding observations. The last chapter ends with concluding observations and offering suggestions.
