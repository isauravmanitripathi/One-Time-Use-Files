## **Swadeshi Movement**

**Lokmanya Tilak** spread the message of swadeshi to Poona and Bombay and organised Ganapati and Shivaji festivals to arouse patriotic feelings. He stressed that the aim of swadeshi, boycott, and national education was the attainment of swaraj. He opened cooperative stores and headed the Swadeshi Wastu Pracharini Sabha.

**Lala Lajpat Rai** took the movement to Punjab and parts of northern India. He was assisted in his venture by Ajit Singh. His articles, which were published in *Kayastha Samachar,* endorsed technical education and industrial self-sufficiency.

**Syed Haider Raza** popularised the Swadeshi Movement in Delhi.

**Chidambaram Pillai,** who joined politics following the partition of Bengal, spread the Swadeshi Movement to Madras and organised the strike of the Tuticorin Coral Mill to protest against the working conditions in the mills. He founded the Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company in Tuticorin on the east coast of the Madras Province to break the trade monopolly of the British India Steam Navigation Company. He bought the SS *Lavo* and SS *Galia* from France and started regular services between Tuticorin and Colombo (Sri Lanka) though the British tried their best to suppress his efforts. His ships flew flags emblazoned with 'Vande Mataram'. In 1908, he was sentenced to two life terms for sedition for his political activities. He was not seen as a political prisoner but was reportedly put to hard labour and even tortured. Though his sentence was reduced by the Madras High Court and he was released in 1912, he faced hardship as his lawyer's licence had been revoked and he could not practise. He opened a shop for a livelihood. An erudite scholar, he wrote his autobiography in Tamil verse. He also wrote a commentary on the *Thirukural* and compiled the ancient works of Tamil grammar, *Tholkappiam*.

**Bipin Chandra Pal** of the Extremist clan played a major role in popularising the movement, especially in the urban areas. He was the editor of *New India.*

**Liaquat Hussain** of Patna suggested boycott and organised the East Indian Railway strike in 1906. He also wrote fiery articles in Urdu to rouse nationalist sentiments in Muslims. He was supported by other Muslim swadeshi agitators like **Ghaznavi, Rasul, Din Mohammed, Dedar Bux, Moniruzzaman, Ismail Hussain, Siraji, Abdul Hussain,** and **Abdul Gaffar.**

**Shyamsundar Chakrabarti,** a swadeshi political leader, helped in organising strikes. He was one of the 'Pabna Group' of Bengali revolutionaries. He was a nationalist journalist who was the sub-editor of the revolutionary journal *Sandhya*, later joining the Bengali nationalist newspaper *Bande Mataram* as an assistant to its editor Aurobindo Ghosh, afterwards becoming its editor. He was deported to Burma in 1908 for his political activities. Much later, he became a supporter of the non-violent methods of the Indian National Congress.

**Ramendra Sunder Trivedi** called for observance of *arandhan* (keeping the hearth unlit) as a mark of mourning and protest on the day the partition was put into effect.

**Rabindranath Tagore** composed several songs to inspire freedom struggle and revived Bengali folk music to rouse national pride. He also set up some swadeshi stores and called for the observance of *raksha bandhan* (tying of threads on each other's wrists as a sign of brotherhood).

**Aurobindo Ghosh** was in favour of extending the movement to the rest of India. He was appointed as the principal of Bengal National College founded in 1906 to encourage patriotic thinking and an education system related to Indian conditions and culture. He was also the editor of *Bande Mataram* and through his editorials encouraged strikes, national education, etc., in the spirit of the Swadeshi Movement. He was assisted by **Jatindranath Bannerji** and **Barindrakumar Ghosh** (who managed the Anushilan Samiti).

**Sakharam Ganesh Deuskar** hailed from Maharashtra but was domiciled in Bengal. He was a close associate of Aurobindo Ghosh and a good writer in Bengali. He is probably best known for his book, *Desher Katha*, that described the British exploitation of India. In this book, Deuskar considered the state of the country and the good and evil of British rule, the mental degradation of the people of this country who had been hypnotised and their minds conquered by the British (or the West), the ruin of the peasants and the artisans of Bengal, and the decline of indigenous industries. Deuskar was influenced by the writings of Naoroji and Dutt on the economic conditions of India under British rule, and wrote in the vernacular to spread the idea among the masses. The book proved immensely popular and served as an inspiration to the Swadeshi Movement. The government banned the book in 1910 and confiscated all the available copies but, by then, it had been read by innumerable people. Deuskar is reputed to have introduced the Shivaji festival in Bengal. The earliest modern political use of the word '*swaraj*' is considered to have been by Deuskar in his pamphlet on Shivaji (1902).

**Sarala Devi Ghoshal (Chaudarani)**, daughter of Janakinath Ghoshal, one of the founding members of the Indian National Congress, was Rabindranath Tagore's niece. A bright student, she pursued higher education at Bethune College under Calcutta University to become the first woman to achieve the highest marks in that university and receive the '*Padmaboti Swarnapodok*', the gold medal. She worked for a while as assistant superintendent at the Maharani Girls School in Mysore before returning to Calcutta where she edited the Bengali magazine, *Bharati Patrika*. She wrote a book, *Ahitagnika*, to generate awareness concerning the freedom struggle among school children and also launched an underground revolutionary group as she believed aggression and violence to be the only way to get freedom from the British. She is considered to have contributed to the music of *Bande Mataram*, the national song, and written several other songs used by revolutionaries. She was among the first to promote the use of swadeshi products and opened a shop called Lakhir Bhandar in the Bowbazar neighbourhood of Calcutta that sold only swadeshi products. Sarla Devi founded the Bharat Stree

Mahamandal, the All India Women's Organisation, a pioneering venture; it was a semi-revolutionary group in Allahabad, Lahore, Amritsar, Delhi, Karachi, Hyderabad, Kanpur, and Calcutta. Married to Rambhaja Dutta Chowdhury, a noted freedom fighter from Punjab, she moved to Lahore with her husband. She continued with her revolutionary work in Punjab besides opening several associations and organisations for women, one of which was a home for widows. She was associated with the newspaper *Hindusthan* as editor and publisher. Towards the end of her life, she was involved in writing her biography, *Jiboner Jhora Pata* (the 'Scattered Leaves of My Life').

A successful lawyer, he boycotted the law courts and gave up a lucrative practice. His three subordinates and supporters, **Birendranath Samsal** in Midnapore, **J.M. Sengupta** in Chittagong and **Subhash Bose** in Calcutta played a major role in uniting the Hindus and Muslims.

Gandhi** formally launched the Civil Disobedience Movement on April 6, 1930 by picking a handful of salt after the completion of the historic 'Dandi March' from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi, thus breaking the salt law imposed by the government.

Homi Modi, in his presidential speech to Bombay Mill-owners' Association in March 1931 said that though the Swadeshi Movement had helped the Indian industry, frequent strikes had dislocated trade and industry.
