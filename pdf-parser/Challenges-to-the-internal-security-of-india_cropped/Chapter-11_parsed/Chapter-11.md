# **Security Forces and Their Mandate**

# $>$ | 11.1 Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs)

There are basically two types of central security forces, viz., CAPF and **CPMF.** 

CAPFs stand for Central Armed Police Forces. This new terminology was introduced in 2011 on the request of the Army. Presently the CAPF comprise the following eight police forces of the Union government.

- (a)  $BSF$  (b)  $CRPF$  (c)  $ITBP$  (d)  $CISF$
- (e) SSB (f) NSG (g) SPG (h) RPF

The first six, viz., BSF, CRPF, ITBP, CISF, SSB and NSG are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), while the SPG is under the Cabinet Secretariat and the RPF is under the Ministry of Railways. They all are headed by senior IPS officers. Most of the higher posts in these five are filled through deputation by IPS officers. These forces assist and report to MHA. Earlier they were known as Central Paramilitary

basically border guarding forces while the CRPF is for internal security and election duties.

CRPF also provides security to major critical installations of the country. NSG is the commando force meant for counter terrorism but also looks after high risk VIP security. SPG is for proximate security of PM and ex-PM while RPF guards railway property and ensures passenger safety.

### > 11.1.1 Border Security Force (BSF)

The Border Security Force (BSF) is a border guarding force. It was established on December 1, 1965. Its primary role is to guard India's international borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh during peacetime and also prevent trans-border crime. BSF is headed by an IPS officer and is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). The Indo-Pakistan war of 1965 demonstrated the inadequacies of the existing border management system and led to the formation of the Border Security Force as a unified central agency with the specific mandate of guarding India's international boundaries with Pakistan. The BSF had trained, supported and formed a part of 'MuktiVahini'. The BSF had played an important role in the liberation of Bangladesh. It has a strength of 2,50,000 personnel in 186 battalions. Some battalions of BSF are also deployed with CRPF in Naxal affected region of Dandakaranya and Jammu and Kashmir. The air wing of the BSF also played a constructive role in the relief work in Uttarakhand during the Kedarnath disaster in 2013. Two battalions of the BSF, located at Kolkata and Guwahati, are designated as the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).

### **Role of BSF During Peacetime**

During peacetime, the BSF is associated with the following:

# > 11.3 Security Agencies and their Mandates

## > 11.3.1 Intelligence Bureau (IB)

The Intelligence Bureau (IB) is India's internal <u>intelligence agency</u> and reputedly the world's oldest intelligence agency. It was recast as the Central Intelligence Bureau in 1947 under the Ministry of Home Affairs. Serving since December 2012, Syed Asif Ibrahim is the current director of

the IB.

The Bureau comprises employees from law enforcement agencies, mostly from the <u>Indian Police Service</u> (IPS) and the military. However, the Director of Intelligence Bureau (DIB) has always been an IPS officer. In addition to domestic intelligence responsibilities, the IB is particularly entrusted with intelligence collection in border areas, following the 1951 recommendations

![](0__page_10_Figure_9.jpeg)

![](0__page_10_Picture_10.jpeg)

![](0__page_10_Picture_11.jpeg)

intelligence organisations. All spheres of human activity within India and in the neighbourhood are allocated to the charter of duties of the Intelligence Bureau. The IB is used to garner intelligence from within India and also execute counter-intelligence and counter-terrorism tasks.

The Intelligence Bureau reportedly has a lot of successes to its credit, but operations conducted by the IB are rarely declassified. Due to the extreme secrecy surrounding the agency, there is little concrete information available about it or its activities.

The IB was initially India's internal and external intelligence agency. After the <u>Sino-Indian War</u> of 1962, and later on, <u>India-Pakistan War</u> in 1965, it was bifurcated in 1968 and entrusted with the task of internal intelligence only.

IB is the main coordinating agency regarding counter-terrorism. It

coordinates with various states' police all over the country.

The IB has had mixed success in counter-terrorism. It was reported in 2008 that the IB had been successful in busting terror modules. It alerted the police before the Hyderabad blasts and gave repeated warnings of a possible attack on Mumbai through the sea before the November 2008 Mumbai attacks.

## > 11.3.2 National Investigation Agency (NIA)

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is a federal agency established by the Indian government to combat terror in India. It acts as the central counter-terrorism law enforcement agency. The agency is empowered to deal with terror related crimes across states without special permission from the states. The Agency came into existence with the enactment of the National Investigation Agency Act 2008 by the Parliament on December 31, 2008. NIA was created after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks as the need for a central agency to combat terrorism were realised. The founding Director-General of NIA was Radha Vinod Raju, and he served till January 31, 2010.

![](0__page_11_Figure_9.jpeg)

![](0__page_11_Picture_11.jpeg)

appointed the member of the National Human Rights Commission of India. In July 2013, Sharad Kumar was appointed as the Chief of NIA. The Agency has been empowered to conduct investigation and prosecution of offenses under the Acts specified in the Schedule of the NIA Act. A State Government may request the Central Government to hand over the investigation of a case to the NIA, provided the case has been registered for the offenses as contained in the schedule to the NIA Act. Central Government can also order NIA to take over investigation of any scheduled offense anywhere in India. Officers of the NIA who are drawn from the <u>Indian Police Service</u> and the <u>Indian Revenue Service</u> have all powers, privileges and liabilities which the police officers have in connection with investigation of any offense. In recent times, the NIA has had big successes in busting an IM module and arresting its key functionaries.

### **Multi Agency Centre (MAC)**

MAC is a multi-agency centre for counter-terrorism whose mandate is to share terrorism related inputs on a day-to-day basis.

Multi Agency Centre (MAC) was created at Delhi and Subsidiary Multi Agency Centres (SMACs) in various states comprising representatives from various security agencies, for streamlining intelligence efforts. Later, the Union Home Minister reviewed the security situation and issued Multi Agency Centre (functions, powers and duties) Order, 2008 on December 31, 2008. MAC-SMAC is functioning since 2002 and has been reoperationalised with effect from 2009. As a follow up of the above order, 24x7 Control Rooms have been set up at Multi Agency Centre (MAC) at New Delhi and the Subsidiary Multi Agency Centres (SMACs) at State Level and at Headquarters of Intelligence Wings of other agencies to ensure timely sharing of information and better co-ordination between intelligence agencies. Daily meetings of Nodal Officers of 25 member agencies are being

### conducted on every working day. Presently, MAC-SMAC network has 416

![](0__page_12_Picture_6.jpeg)

![](0__page_12_Picture_7.jpeg)

nodes spread across the country and connected to MAC HQ at New Delhi. This includes 31 SMAC HQs and 32 SSBs located at State Capitals (More details on MAC is given in Chapter 2).

### **National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID)**

The National Intelligence Grid or NATGRID is an integrated intelligence grid that will link the databases of several departments and ministries of the Government of India so as to collect comprehensive patterns of intelligence that can be readily accessed by intelligence agencies. It was first proposed in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on Mumbai in 2008 and was to be operational in 2013 but is yet to happen.

NATGRID is an intelligence sharing network that collates data from the standalone databases of various agencies and ministries of the Indian

government. It is a counter-terrorism measure that collects and collates a host of information from government databases, including tax and bank account details, credit card transactions, visa and immigration records and itineraries of rail and air travel. This combined data will be made available to 11 central agencies-Research and Analysis Wing, the Intelligence Bureau, Central Bureau of Investigation, Financial Intelligence Unit, Central Board of Direct Taxes, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Enforcement Directorate, Narcotics Control Bureau, Central Board of Excise and Customs and the Directorate General of Central Excise Intelligence.

Unlike the NCTC and the NIA which are central organisations, the NATGRID is essentially a tool that will enable security agencies to locate and obtain relevant information on terror suspects from pooled data of various organisations and services in the country. It will help identify, capture and prosecute terrorists and help pre-empt terrorist plots.
