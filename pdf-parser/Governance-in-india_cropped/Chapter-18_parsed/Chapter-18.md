# **WELFARE OF WOMEN**

The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) and the Central Social Welfare Board (CSWB) are implementing various schemes and programmes for the welfare and development of women. These are explained as follows:

### **1. Rajiv Gandhi Scheme for Empowerment of Adolescent Girls (Sabla)**

A comprehensive scheme for the holistic development of adolescent girls called 'Rajiv Gandhi Scheme for Empowerment of Adolescent Girls' (Sabla) was introduced in the year 2010. Sabla is being implemented in 205 selected districts across the country, using the ICDS platform. In these districts, Sabla has replaced the Nutrition Programme for Adolescent Girls (NPAG) and Kishori Shakti Yojana (KSY). In the non-Sabla districts, KSY continues as before.

Sabla is being implemented through the State Governments/UTs with 100 per cent financial assistance from the Central Government for all inputs other than nutrition provision for which 50% Central assistance is provided to states. Anganwadi Centre is the focal point for the delivery of the services. Sabla aims at an all-round development of adolescent girls (AGs) of 11–18 years by making them self reliant by facilitating access to learning, health and nutrition through various interventions such as health, education, vocational training, etc.

The scheme has two major components, i.e., Nutrition and Non-Nutrition. Nutrition component containing 600 calories, 18-20 grams of protein and micronutrients per beneficiary per day for 300 days in a year is being given in the form of Take Home Ration or Hot Cooked Meal to 11–14 years out of school girls and all girls of 14–18 years age (out-of-school and in school girls). In the Non-Nutrition Component, the Out-of-school Adolescent Girls 11–18 years are being provided IFA supplementation, Health check-up and Referral services, Nutrition & Health Education, Counselling/Guidance on family welfare, Adolescent Reproductive Sexual Health (ARSH), childcare practices and Life Skill Education and accessing public services. 16–18-year-old AGs are also given vocational training.

#### **2. Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana (IGMSY)**

The IGMSY is a Conditional Cash Transfer Scheme for pregnant and lactating women. It was

introduced in the year 2010 to contribute to better enabling environment by providing cash incentives for improved health and nutrition to pregnant and nursing mothers.

The Scheme envisages providing cash to Pregnant & Lactating (P&L) women during pregnancy and lactation in response to individual fulfilling specific conditions. It addresses short-term income support objectives with long-term objective of behavioural and attitudinal changes. The scheme attempts to partly compensate for wage loss to Pregnant & Lactating women both prior to and after delivery of the child.

Being implemented on pilot basis in 53 selected districts using the platform of ICDS, 12.5 lakh P & L women are expected to be covered every year under IGMSY. The beneficiaries are paid  $\neq 4000$  in three installments per P & L woman between the second trimester and till the child attains the age of 6 months on fulfilling specific conditions related to maternal and child health. Pregnant women of 19 years of age and above for first two live births are eligible under the scheme. All Government/Public Sector Undertakings (Central and state) employees are excluded from the scheme as they are entitled for paid maternity leave. The wives of such employees are also excluded from the Scheme.

### **3. Support to Training & Employment Programme for Women (STEP)**

The STEP scheme was launched as a Central Sector Scheme in 1986-87. The scheme aims to make a significant impact on women by upgrading skills for employment on a self-sustainable basis and income generation for marginalised and asset-less rural and urban women especially those in SC/ST households and families below poverty line. The key strategies include training for skill development, mobilising women in viable groups, arranging for marketing linkages and access to credit.

The scheme also provides for enabling support services in the form of health checkups, child-care, legal & health literacy, elementary education and gender sensitisation. The scheme envisages each project to thrive on a self sustainable basis with minimum governmental support and intervention even after the project period is over.

The scheme covers 10 sectors of employment i.e. Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Dairying, Fisheries, Handlooms, Handicrafts, Khadi and Village Industries, Sericulture, Waste Land Development and Social Forestry. The scope and coverage of the scheme has been enlarged with the introduction of locally appropriate sectors.

#### **4. Hostel for Working Women (WWH)**

The Scheme of Hostel for Working Women envisages provision of safe and affordable hostel accommodation to working, single working woman, women working at places away from their hometown and for women being trained for employment.

The scheme has been revised with following salient features:

- (i) Financial assistance for construction of hostel building to be given only on public land.
- (ii) Financial assistance available for rent of the hostels run in rented premises also.
- (iii) Provision for maintenance grant of hostel building (maximum  $\epsilon$  5 lakh) and one-time nonrecurring grant for furnishings for  $\sqrt{7500}$  per beneficiary.

(iv) State government agencies, Urban Municipal Bodies, Cantonment Boards, Civil Society Organisations, Panchayati Raj Institutions, Self Help Groups, recognised Colleges/Universities and Corporate or associations like CII, ASSOCHAM and FICCI included under the revised scheme.

Since its inception in 1972–73, 902 working women hostels have been sanctioned under the scheme all over the country benefiting about 67,284 working women.

### **5. Women Empowerment and Livelihood Programme in Mid-Gangetic Plains (Priyadarshini)**

From the year 2011, the Ministry is administering IFAD assisted pilot project namely Women's Empowerment and Livelihoods Programme in the Mid-Gangetic Plains "Priyadarshini" in 13 blocks spread over five districts in Uttar Pradesh and two districts in Bihar. The Programme aims at holistic empowerment (economic and social) of vulnerable groups of women and adolescent girls in the project area through formation of women's Self Help Groups (SHGs) and promotion of improved livelihood opportunities. Over 1,00,000 households are to be covered under the project and 7,200 SHGs will be formed during the project period ending 2016–17. Though the focus of project is on livelihood enhancement, the beneficiaries will be empowered to address their political, legal and health problems issues through rigorous capacity building.

National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) is the lead programme agency for the implementation through engagement of Resource NGOs and Field NGOs (FNGOs). FNGOs are envisaged to carry out all field level activities, whereas a Resource NGO (RNGO) has been envisioned to undertake activities relating to specialised capacity building and provide other technical support to all field level project functionaries to ensure effective implementation of the programme. The programme envisages giving training to the SHG members on topics such as income generation and allied activities, marketing of products and social issues, etc.

#### **6. Swadhar (Scheme for Women in Difficult Circumstances)**

Swadhar Scheme was launched by the Ministry during the year 2001-02 for the benefit of women in difficult circumstances with the following objectives:

Under the Scheme, assistance is provided to eligible organisations for undertaking the above activities.

#### **8. Family Counselling Centers (FCCs)**

The Family Counselling Centre programme was introduced in 1983 due to increasing violence against women specially dowry related cases. The centres provide counseling, referral and rehabilitative services to women and girls who are victims of atrocities, family maladjustments and social ostracism.

Through the centres, crisis intervention and trauma counselling is also provided in case of natural or manmade disasters. Public opinion on social issues affecting status of women is mobilised through this programme and awareness is created on welfare and development schemes being implemented by the Government.

The Counselling Centres work in close collaboration with the local administration, police, courts, free legal aids cells, medical and psychiatric institutions, vocational training centers, short stay homes etc.

#### **9. Short Stay Home Programme**

The objective of the Short Stay Homes programme is to rehabilitate women and girls who are facing social, economical and emotional setback due to family problem, exploitations, violence or being forced into prostitution.

Under Short Stay Home programme, temporary shelter to women and girls, medical care, counseling, occupational therapy, education and vocational training is provided according to the requirements of the inmates. The period of stay normally extends from six months to three years.

Under the programme, meetings have been held all over India with the functionaries of the voluntary organisations and rehabilitation officers for capacity building and improved networking so that the inmates are made self-reliant and can join the mainstream.

# **10. Awareness Generation Programme (AGP)**

The Scheme aims to empower women by providing knowledge on issues ranging from health/nutrition to constitutional rights by providing information through organising awareness generation camp and to ensure their participation in development process and decision making. The scheme was reformulated in 1986-87.

Under the scheme, camps are organised throughout the country which provide a platform for women to come together to exchange their experiences and their ideas. Its main aim is to identify the needs of rural and poor women and to increase women's active participation in development and other allied programmes. Issues such as status of women, women & law, women & health, community health and hygiene, technology for women, environment and economy are being taken up in the camps with special focus on local burning issues/problems like female foeticide, domestic violence, trafficking, drug addiction and low sex ratio, etc.

## **11. Condensed Courses of Education for Adult Women (CCE)**

The scheme of Condensed Courses of Education for Adult Women was initiated by CSWB to cater to the needs of adult girls/women who were drop outs from formal schools.

The main focus of the scheme is to ensure that contents of the course are need based and modified according to local requirement and simultaneously targeting various stages of educational levels of middle/high school and matric/secondary level courses for adult girls/women above the age of 15 years who could not join mainstream education.

## **12. Integrated Scheme for Women's Empowerment (ISWE)**

The Integrated Scheme for Women's Empowerment is a pilot project for North East, designed to address the socio-economic need of the region for empowerment of women and development of children with the following objectives:

- (i) Mobilising community action.
- (ii) Converging available services and resources in the area.
- (iii) To address the felt needs of the area.

- (iv) Income Generation through feasible and sustainable activities for women.
- (v) Provide support services for health awareness, Career Counseling Centers, vocational training to prevent child trafficking, drug de-addiction.

The project is being implemented in three phases. A State Level Committee is formed in all the States with representatives from State Government Departments, social workers, local leaders and respective State Boards. The committee identifies and adopts the most backward districts of the State and also a Mother NGO having a good track record, adequate infrastructure and experience from the concerned area for implementation of the project. Motivational camps are conducted in identified areas in the States culminating into formation of Community Based Groups (CBG). The groups democratically decide the activity to be undertaken by them.

# **13. Gender Budgeting Scheme**

Gender Budgeting is not an accounting exercise but an ongoing process to ensure that benefits of development reach women as much as men. It entails maintaining a gender perspective at various stages like programme/policy formulation, assessment of needs of target groups, review of existing policies and guidelines, allocation of resources, implementation of programmes, impact assessment, reprioritisation of resources, etc. A gender responsive budget is the culmination of this process.

Gender Budgeting involves dissection of the Government budget to establish its gender-differential impacts and to translate gender commitments into budgetary commitments. It does not seek to create a separate budget but to provide affirmative action to address the specific needs of women. It goes beyond allocation of resources for women, to cover tracking the utilisation of allocated resources, impact analysis and beneficiary incidence analysis of public expenditure and policy from a gender perspective.

To institutionalise Gender Budgeting in India, the setting up of Gender Budgeting Cells (GBCs) in all Ministries/Departments was mandated by the Ministry of Finance in 2004-05.

In 2004-05, the Ministry of Women and Child Development adopted "Budgeting for Gender Equity" as a Mission Statement. The Ministry as the nodal agency for Gender Budgeting has been undertaking several initiatives for taking it forward at the National and State levels. The Ministry has been following a three-pronged strategy to pursue the process of Gender Budgeting in the country:

- (i) Placing emphasis on and advocating for setting up of gender budgeting structures/mechanisms in all Ministries/Departments of the Government;
- (ii) Strengthening internal and external capacities and building expertise to undertake gender mainstreaming of policies/schemes/programmes; and
- (iii) Initiating the exercise of gender auditing of existing programmes, which would then feed into addressing gaps and strengthening service delivery mechanisms.

A Plan Scheme for Gender Budgeting was launched in the year 2008 during the Eleventh Plan period, for conducting trainings/workshops, capacity building, research surveys, etc. Under the Scheme, inter alia, the Ministry undertakes many programmes as well as provides financial support to Central/State Government agencies, for the purpose. This scheme is being continued in the Twelfth Plan.

The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) and the Central Social Welfare Board (CSWB) are implementing various schemes and programmes for the welfare and development of children. These are explained below:

#### **1. Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme**

The Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) of Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme was launched in 1975. It is one of the flagship programmes of the Government of India and represents one of the world's largest and unique programmes for early childhood care and development. It is the foremost symbol of country's commitment to its children and nursing mothers, as a response to the challenge of providing pre-school non-formal education on one hand and breaking the vicious cycle of malnutrition, morbidity, reduced learning capacity and mortality on the other. The beneficiaries under the scheme are children in the age group of 0-6 years, pregnant women and lactating mothers.

**Objectives** The objectives of the scheme are as follows:

- (i) to improve the nutritional and health status of children in the age-group 0-6 years;
- (ii) to lay the foundation for proper psychological, physical and social development of the child;
- (iii) to reduce the incidence of mortality, morbidity, malnutrition and school dropout;
- (iv) to achieve effective co-ordination of policy and implementation amongst the various departments to promote child development; and
- (v) to enhance the capability of the mother to look after the normal health and nutritional needs of the child through proper nutrition and health education.

**Package of Services** The ICDS Scheme offers a package of six services, viz.,

- (i) supplementary nutrition
- (ii) pre-school non-formal education
- (iii) nutrition & health education
- (iv) immunisation
- (v) health check-up
- (vi) referral services

The last three services are related to health and are provided by Ministry/Department of Health and Family Welfare through NRHM & Health system.

The perception of providing a package of services is based primarily on the consideration that the overall impact will be much larger if the different services develop in an integrated manner as the efficacy of a particular service depends upon the support it receives from the related services.

For better governance in the delivery of the scheme, convergence is, therefore, one of the key features of the ICDS scheme. This convergence is in-built in the scheme which provides a platform in the form of Anganwadi Centres for providing all services under the Scheme.

**Restructuring of ICDS** In order to address various programmatic, management and institutional

gaps and to meet administrative and operational challenges, the Government has approved the Strengthening and Restructuring of ICDS Scheme with an allocation of  $\frac{1}{2}$ , 1,23,580 crore during the Twelfth Five Year Plan. The administrative approval in this regard has been issued to the States/UTs in October 2012. The key features of Strengthened and Restructured ICDS, inter-alia, include addressing the gaps and challenges with:

**Wheat Based Nutrition Programme (WBNP)** Under the Wheat Based Nutrition Programme (WBNP), food grains viz., wheat, rice and other coarse grains are allocated at BPL rates to the states/UTs through the Department of Food & Public Distribution (DoFPD), for preparation of supplementary food in ICDS.

The Ministry is responsible for processing and approval of the proposals from the States/UTs for allocation of food grains in coordination with the DoFPD.

**Anganwadi Karyakartri Bima Yojana (AKBY)** The ICDS Scheme envisages Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) as honorary workers who are paid a monthly honorarium. AKBY under the LIC's Social Security Scheme is one of the welfare measures extended to the grassroots functionaries of the ICDS Scheme.

The Government of India has introduced the Anganwadi Karyakatri Bima Yojana in the year 2004.
The premium under the scheme is  $\epsilon$  280 per annum per member out of which  $\epsilon$  100 is paid by LIC from Social Security Fund, 100 by the Government of India and 80 by the Anganwadi Worker/Helper (insured member).

**ICDS Systems Strengthening and Nutrition Improvement Project** In the year 2013, the Ministry of Women and Child Development launched a specific project called "ICDS Systems Strengthening and Nutrition Improvement Project (ISSNIP)" (formerly called ICDS-IV Project). The project is assisted by the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank.

The ISSNIP has been designed to supplement and provide value addition on the existing ICDS programme, through a process of systems strengthening at different levels of programme implementation. It also facilitates the select states/districts to experiment, innovate and conduct pilots of potentially more effective approaches to achieve the early childhood education and nutrition outcomes and offer evidences for scale up. The additional financial and technical support through the project is catalytic and is an important dimension of MWCD's overall efforts to strengthen and restructure the ICDS programme. The project, inter-alia, supports building capacities of district and block level ICDS functionaries for development of District ICDS Action Plans and result-oriented monitoring and evaluation system. The project has four major components, viz.,

- (a) Institutional and systems strengthening in ICDS;
- (b) Community mobilisation and behaviour change communication;
- (c) Piloting multi-sectoral nutrition actions; and
- (d) Project Management, Technical Assistance and Monitoring & Evaluation.

The project is implemented in identified 162 districts having higher proportion of child undernutrition across eight States, viz. Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. Besides, urban pilots are undertaken in and around NCR of Delhi and convergent nutrition action pilots in some selected districts in two non-project States, viz., Odisha and Uttarakhand.

#### **2. Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS)**

The Ministry of Women & Child Devepment introduced, in 2009-10, a comprehensive scheme, namely, the Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) under which financial and technical support is provided to the State Governments/UT Administrations. ICPS brings several existing child protection programmes, under one umbrella, with improved norms. These include: (i) A Programme for Juvenile Justice; (ii) An Integrated Programme for Street Children; and (iii) Scheme for Assistance to Homes [Shishu Greh] to promote In-country Adoption. A number of new initiatives have also been incorporated, such as dedicated service delivery structures at State and district levels, child tracking system, sponsorship, fostercare, etc.

**Objectives** The objectives of the Scheme are to contribute to improvement in the well being of children in difficult circumstances, as well as to the reduction of vulnerabilities to situations and actions that lead to abuse, neglect, exploitation, abandonment and separation of children from their families. These will be achieved by: (i) improved access to and quality of child protection services; (ii) increased public awareness about the reality of child rights, situation and protection in India; (iii) clearly articulated responsibilities and enforced accountability of these responsibilities for child protection; (iv) established and functioning structures at all government levels for delivery of statutory and support services to children in difficult circumstances; (v) evidence based monitoring and evaluation system.

Any child requiring assistance, or adults on their behalf, can call the service for help. Childline personnel reach out to the child and provide necessary assistance through linkages with hospitals, Child Welfare Committees, Shelter Homes, police etc. This service was started in 1996.

### **3. Scheme for Welfare of Working Children in Need of Care and Protection**

**Objective** The objective of the scheme is to provide opportunities for non-formal education and vocational training to working children to facilitate their entry/re-entry into mainstream education in cases where they have either not attended any learning system or where, for some reasons, their education has been discontinued. The scheme lends support to projects only in urban areas and does not support projects in areas covered by the existing schemes of the Ministry of Labour & Employment. This scheme is being implemented since 2005.

**Target Group** This scheme provides support for the holistic development of child workers and potential child workers, especially those with none or ineffective family support such as children of slum/pavement dwellers/drug addicts, children living on railway platforms/along railway lines, children working in shops, dhabas, mechanic shops, children engaged as domestic workers, children whose parents are in jail, children of migrant/sex workers, leprosy patients, etc.

**Components** The programme components are:

- (a) Facilitating introduction and/or return to the mainstream education system as children at study are not children at work.
- (b) Counseling of parents, heads of families, relatives of the children so as to prevent their exploitation, and
- (c) Vocational training wherever necessary.

The Scheme is operated through the voluntary sector and Non-Governmental Organisations are eligible for financial assistance to set up composite centers under this scheme. The Ministry provides 90 per cent financial assistance and the concerned organisation is required to bear 10 per cent of the expenditure on the project as per the norms of the scheme.

#### **4. Rajiv Gandhi National Creche Scheme for the Children of Working Mothers**

Rajiv Gandhi National Creche Scheme for the Children of Working Mothers provides Day Care facilities to children in the age group 0-6 years from families with monthly income of less than 12000. In addition to being a safe space for the children, the crèches provide services such as supplementary nutrition, pre-school education and emergency health care, etc.

The scheme envisages implementation through the Central Social Welfare Board (CSWB), Indian Council for Child Welfare (ICCW) and Bhartiya Adim Jati Sevak Sangh (BAJSS).

The scheme provides grant of  $\epsilon$  3532 per month for a crèche, limited to 90% of the schematic pattern or actual expenditure, whichever is less; and the remaining expenditure is borne by the implementing agencies. Honorarium to creche workers is fully funded under the scheme.

The scheme has in-built component of monitoring of creche. State-wise independent monitoring agencies have been identified which include schools of Social Work, Women's Studies Centres and other reputed agencies. Grant for monitoring of creches is given  $\omega$  700 per crèche visited and inspected and a lump sum one time grant of  $\epsilon$  10000 to each monitoring agency. Every crèche is required to be inspected at least once in a period of two years.

#### **5. Dhanlakshmi (Conditional Cash Transfer for Girl Child)**

A pilot Scheme Dhanlakshmi was launched in 2008 with the objective of:

- (i) Providing a set of staggered financial incentives for families to encourage them to retain the girl child and educate her.
- (ii) Changing the attitudinal mindset of the family towards the girl, by looking upon the girl as an asset rather than a liability, since her very existence has led to cash inflow to the family.

- (iii) Cash transfers are made under the Scheme to the family of the girl child (preferably the mother) on fulfilling the following conditions:
  - (a) Birth registration of the girl child
  - (b) Progress of immunisation
  - (c) Full immunisation
  - (d) Enrolment in school and retention in school

"Dhanlakshmi" is being implemented in 11 blocks across seven states on pilot basis and is being implemented by the state governments through the District Authorities.

## **6. Rajiv Gandhi Scheme for Empowerment of Adolescent Boys (Saksham)**

In March 2014, the Ministry of Women & Child Development has launched a new scheme called Rajiv Gandhi Scheme for Empowerment of Adolescent Boys (RGSEAB) (Saksham) on pilot basis. The Saksham is operational in 20 districts from seven States/UTs, viz., Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Sikkim. These districts have been selected from seven states/UTs on the basis of a composite index based on indicators relevant to the condition of adolescent boys across the country.

The Scheme aims at all-round development of Adolescent Boys (Abs) to make them self-reliant, gender-sensitive and aware citizens, when they grow up. The scheme covers all adolescent boys (both school going and out of school) in the age-group of 11 to 18 years.

The Scheme is implemented using the platform of Integrated Child Services Scheme. Anganwadi centres are the focal point for the delivery of services. However, where infrastructure and other facilities are inadequate in AWC, alternative arrangements have been made in schools/Panchayats or community buildings etc.

The Saksham is a centrally sponsored scheme, implemented by the State Government for which the Government of India and States/UTs shares the cost in ratio of 75:25, except in case of North Eastern State (Sikkim), where the share of Centre and State/UT is in the ratio of 90:10 of the financial norms.

## **B. Schemes of Economic Empowerment**

**1. Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCSP)** The Special Component Plan for Scheduled Castes evolved in 1979 has been renamed as Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCSP). The strategy of Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCSP) is one of the most important interventions through the planning process for social, economic and educational development of Scheduled Castes and also for improvement in their working and living conditions.

The Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCSP) is not a scheme by itself. It is an umbrella strategy to ensure flow of targeted financial and physical benefits from all the general sectors of development for the benefit of Scheduled Castes. Under this strategy, States/UTs and Central Ministries are required to formulate and implement Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCSP) as part of their Annual Plans by earmarking resources in proportion to their share in total population.

At present, 27 States/UTs having siseable SC populations are implementing Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan. The Ministry regularly impresses upon the States to ensure adequate allocations under Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan during interactions with them. As an incentive, 25% Special Central Assistance is released to States/UTs on the basis of percentage allocation made by them under Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan as compared to share of Scheduled Castes population in the total population.

**2. Special Central Assistance (SCA) to Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCSP)** The Special Central Assistance (SCA) to Scheduled Castes Sub Plan (SCSP) is a central sector scheme, started in 1980, under which 100% grant is given to the States/UTs, as an additive to their Scheduled Castes Sub Plan (SCSP). The main objective is to give a thrust to family-oriented schemes of economic development of SCs below the poverty line. The Central assistance under the scheme is released to States/UTs on the basis of the following criteria:

| <b>Table 18.1</b><br>Criteria for Release of Funds to States/UTs Under SCA to SCSP |                                                                                                                                                                   |            |

**3. Assistance to State Schedule Castes Development Corporations** The Centrally Sponsored Scheme for participating in the equity share of the Schedule Castes Development Corporations (SCDCs) in the ratio of 49:51 (Central:State) was introduced in 1979. At present, SCDCs are functioning in 27 States/UTs. The main functions of SCDCs include identification of eligible SC families and motivating them to undertake economic development scheme, sponsoring the schemes to financial institutions for credit support, providing financial assistance in the form of margin money at low rate of interest and subsidy in order to reduce the repayment liability and providing necessary tie up with other poverty alleviation programmes. The SCDCs are playing an important role in providing credit and inputs by way of margin money loans and subsidy to the target group.

The SCDCs finance employment oriented schemes covering (i) Agriculture and allied activities including minor irrigation, (ii) Small Scale Industry, (iii) Transport, and (iv) Trade and Service Sector. The SCDCs finance projects by dovetailing loan component from NSFDC/banks along with margin money out of their own funds and subsidy out of Special Center Assistance (SCA).

**4. National Scheduled Castes Finance & Development Corporation** The National Scheduled Castes Finance & Development Corporation (NSFDC) was set up by the Government of India in the year 1989. The broad objective of NSFDC is to provide financial assistance in the form of concessional loans to Scheduled Castes families, and skill-cum-entrepreneurial training to the youth of the target group, living below Double the Poverty Line [presently  $\epsilon$  81,000 per annum for rural area and  $\sqrt{1,03,000}$  per annum for urban areas] for their economic development.

The Authorised Share Capital of the Corporation is  $\frac{1}{3}$ , 1,000 crore and Paid-Up Capital is  $\frac{1}{3}$  781.80 crore including 100 crore released during 2012-13. The Corporation has so far disbursed 2504.70 crore covering 8.60 lakh beneficiaries upto 2013. The NSFDC functions through Channel Finance System in which concessional loans are routed to the beneficiaries through the State Channelising Agencies (SCAs) appointed by the respective state Governments/Union Territories.

**5. National Safai Karamcharis Finance & Development Corporation** The National Safai Karamcharis Finance and Development Corporation (NSKFDC) was incorporated in the year 1997

as a company not for profit. The target group of the Corporation are "Scavengers", which means persons wholly or partially employed for manual handling of human excreta and their dependents, and "Safai Karamcharis" which means persons engaged in or employed for any sanitation work, and their dependents.

No income limit is fixed for availing financial assistance. However, the Corporation accords priority to the economic development and rehabilitation of scavengers, women and Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) from among the target group. The NSKFDC provides loan at the concessional rate of interest to the beneficiaries through the State Channelising Agencies (SCAs) appointed by the respective State Governments/Union Territories across the country.

Initially, the Authorised Share Capital of the Corporation was  $\frac{1}{2}$  200 crores which was enhanced to  $\frac{300}{200}$  crores in 2009 and to  $\frac{1}{200}$  crores in 2012. The paid up capital of the Corporation in 2013 was  $\frac{394.99}{ }$  crore. During 2012-13,  $\frac{1}{2}$  50 crore has been released as Equity Share Capital to the Corporation.

The Corporation implements schemes to promote self employment in an alternative occupation through concessional finance, and skill development. Since its inception, the Corporation has disbursed  $829.81$  crore covering 248,019 beneficiaries.

### **C. Schemes of Social Empowerment**

**1. Assistance for Implementation of the** *Protection of Civil Rights Act and the SCs and STs (Prevention of Atrocities) Act:* These two Acts are implemented by the respective state Governments and Union Territory Administrations. With a view to ensure their effective implementation by the states, Central assistance is provided to them under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme for implementation of the *Protection of Civil Rights Act*, 1955 and the *Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act*, 1989, for following purposes:-

- (i) Functioning and strengthening of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Protection Cell and Special Police Stations.
- (ii) Setting up and functioning of exclusive Special Courts.
- (iii) Relief and Rehabilitation to atrocity victims.
- (iv) Incentive for Inter-Caste Marriages, where one of the spouses is a member of Scheduled Caste
- (v) Awareness generation.

The funding pattern of the scheme is such that over and above the committed liability of respective State Governments, the expenditure is shared between Centre and States on 50:50 basis and UT Administrations receive 100% Central assistance.

**2. Pilot Scheme of Pradhan Mantri Adrash Gram Yojana (PMAGY)** The pilot PMAGY scheme has been launched in 2010. The scheme aims at integrated development of the selected 1000 villages having more than 50% SC population, into "model villages" so that, inter alia,

- (i) they have requisite physical and social infrastructure for their socio-economic development;
- (ii) disparity between SC and non-SC population of the village in terms of common socioeconomic indicators (e.g., literacy rate, completion rate of elementary education, IMR/MMR, ownership of productive assets, etc.) is eliminated, and the indicators are raised to at least the level of the national average; and

(iii) untouchability, discrimination, segregation, and atrocities against SCs are eliminated, as are other social evils like discrimination against girls/women, alcoholism and substance (drugs) abuse, etc., and all sections of society are able to live with dignity and equality, and in harmony with others.

**3. Scheme of Grants-in-aid to Voluntary Organisations Working for Scheduled Castes** The main objective behind the scheme is to involve the voluntary sector to improve educational and socioeconomic conditions of the target group i.e. Scheduled Castes with a view to upgrade skill to enable them to start income generating activities on their own or get gainfully employed in some sector or the other. The principle that good voluntary organisations should not only be assisted but also consciously built up, has been guiding spirit behind the formulation of the scheme. The following facts can be noted:

- (i) The scheme was started in 1953-54.
- (ii) The scheme was last revised in 1998.
- (iii) Projects covered under the scheme are 40.

The scheme provides that quantum of assistance shall be determined in each case on merit. However, Government of India may meet 90% of the approved expenditure. The remaining expenditure is to be met by the concerned voluntary organisation from its own source.

**4. Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers** A National Scheme of Liberation and Rehabilitation of Scavengers and their Dependents (NSLRS) was started in 1992 to rehabilitate manual scavengers and their dependents in alternative occupations. As per reports received from State Governments from time to time, there were about 7.70 lakh manual scavengers and their dependents, to be rehabilitated under NSLRS. Out of this, about 4.23 lakh beneficiaries were assisted for rehabilitation, during the period of implementation of NSLRS.

This Ministry formulated a 'Self Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers' (SRMS) which was introduced in January 2007 with the objective of rehabilitating remaining manual scavengers and their dependents by March, 2009. Under the scheme, the identified beneficiaries were provided loan, at subsidised rate of interest, and credit linked capital subsidy for setting up self employment projects. It also had liberal provisions for training of beneficiaries in marketable skills to enhance their employability. They were paid a stipend of  $\epsilon$  1000 per month during the period of training.

The Self Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers originally envisaged rehabilitation of all manual scavengers in alternative occupations by March 2009. However, as this could not be done by the target date, the scheme was extended upto March 2010, with a provision for the coverage of spill-over beneficiaries even thereafter, if required. As per the updated number reported by States/UTs after launch of the scheme, about 1.18 lakh manual scavengers and their dependents in 18 States/UTs were identified for implementation of the scheme.

There was a proposal to revise the existing SRMS to make it more effective. Hence, the Scheme has been revised w.e.f. November, 2013. As per the revised scheme, identified manual scavengers, one from each family, are provided one-time cash assistance. The identified manual scavengers and their dependents are provided project based back-ended capital subsidy upto  $\epsilon$  3,25,000 and concessional loan for undertaking self-employment ventures. Beneficiaries are also provided training for skill development for a period upto two years, during which a stipend of  $\frac{3,000}{2}$  per month is also provided.

# **Reservation in Education & Employment**

**Reservation in Education** The *Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act*, 2006 came into force with effect from academic session 2008-09. The Act provides for Reservation of 15% for the students belonging to the Scheduled Caste, 7.5% for Scheduled Tribes & 27% for Other Backward Classes (excluding creamy layer) in central educational institutions (other than those exempted under the Act).

**Reservation in Employment** Instructions were issued by Ministry of Home Affairs in 1947, providing 12.5% reservation in direct recruitment made by open competition and 16.66% for other than by open competition for Scheduled Castes. With the increase in the percentage of Scheduled Castes population, a need was felt to increase the reservation percentage. The 1961-Census showed that the percentage of population of Scheduled Castes was 14.7%. Accordingly, in 1970, the percentage of reservation for Scheduled Castes in direct recruitment by open competition was increased from 12.5% to 15%. The percentages of reservation in the case of direct recruitment otherwise than by open competition was kept unchanged at 16.66%. The position regarding percentage of reservation for SCs/STs in public employment has remained unchanged since then. The reservation policy of the Government is mutatis-mutandis extended to Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs).

# **WELFARE OF STS**

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) is implementing various schemes and programmes for the welfare and development of the Scheduled Tribes (STs). These are explained below:

## **A. Schemes of Educational Empowerment**

**1. Scheme for Construction of Hostels for ST Girls and Boys** The objective of the scheme is to promote literacy among tribal students by providing hostel accommodation to such ST students who would otherwise have been unable to continue their education because of their poor economic condition, and the remote location of their villages. The scheme was revised in 2008.

The scheme covers the entire ST population in the country and is not area-specific. However, the hostels under the scheme would be sanctioned as far as possible as a part of the established educational institutions or in the close vicinity of such institutions/vocational training centres.

The scheme provides for the construction of new hostels and extension of existing hostel buildings for the middle, secondary, college and university levels of education.

**2. Scheme for the Establishment of Ashram Schools in Tribal Sub-Plan Areas** The objective of the scheme is to promote expansion of educational facilities for Scheduled Tribe students including PTGs. Ashram Schools provide education with residential facilities in an environment conducive to learning. The Scheme was revised in 2008.

The scheme covers all the Tribal Sub-plan areas of the country spread over 22 States and 2 Union Territories.

The scheme provides funds for the construction of school buildings from the primary to the senior

secondary stage and also provides for the upgradation of the existing Ashram Schools for Scheduled Tribes Boys and Girls including PTGs.

**3. Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme** The objective of the scheme is to provide financial assistance to the Scheduled Tribe students studying at post-matriculation or post-secondary levels to enable them to complete their education. The scheme was revised in 2010.

The Commercial Pilot Licence Course (CPL) is also included in the scheme of Post-Matric Scholarship for ST students and 10 scholarships are to be given to the eligible ST students per year.

The students are provided different rates of scholarships depending on the course. The courses have been divided into four categories and the rates vary from  $\frac{1200}{1200}$  per month. Besides, the compulsory fees are also being reimbursed.

**4. Book Bank Scheme** Many ST students selected in professional courses find it difficult to continue their education for want of books on their subjects, as these are often expensive. In order to reduce the dropout rate of ST students from professional institutes/universities, funds are provided for purchase of books under this scheme.

The scheme is open to all ST students pursuing medical (including Indian Systems of Medicine & Homeopathy) engineering, agriculture, veterinary, polytechnic, law, chartered accountancy, business management, bio-science subjects, who are receiving Post-Matric Scholarships.

**5. Upgradation of Merit Scheme** The objective of the scheme is to upgrade the merit of Scheduled Tribe including PTG students in classes IX to XII by providing them with facilities for all-round development through education in residential schools so that they can compete with other students for admission to higher education courses and for senior administrative and technical occupations.

Coaching is provided in languages, science, mathematics as well as special coaching for admission to professional courses like engineering and medicine. A revised package grant of  $\epsilon$  19,500 per student per year is provided from 2008-09 which includes the honorarium to be paid to the Principal or Experts imparting coaching and also to meet incidental charges.

**6. National Overseas Scholarship Scheme for Higher Studies Abroad** The objective of the scheme is to provide financial assistance to selected ST students pursuing higher studies abroad (Masters, Doctoral and Post-Doctoral level) in certain specified fields of Engineering, Technology and Science only. This was a Non-Plan scheme, which became a Plan scheme from 2007-08.

Thirteen Scheduled Tribe candidates and two candidates belonging to PTGs can be awarded the scholarship annually for pursuing Post Graduate, Doctoral and Post-Doctoral level courses abroad. The scholarship is not awarded for pursuing graduate courses.

The scholarship is awarded to ST candidates (one member from each family) below 35 years of age on the date of advertisement, provided the total income of the candidate or his/her parents/guardians does not exceed  $\sqrt{25,000}$  per month.

**7. Rajiv Gandhi National Fellowship** The objective of the scheme is to provide fellowships in the form of financial assistance to students belonging to the Scheduled Tribes to pursue higher studies such as M.Phil and Ph.D. The scheme has been started from the year 2005-06.

This scheme covers all the Universities/Institutions recognised by the University Grants

Commission (UGC).

Under the scheme, 667 fellowships are provided to the ST students each year. The maximum duration of the fellowships is five years.

**8. Scheme of Top Class Education for ST Students** The objective of the scheme is to encourage meritorious ST students for pursuing studies at degree and post-degree level in any of the selected list of institutes, in which the scholarship scheme would be operative. The scheme has been started from 2007-08.

There are 213 institutes approved under the scheme in both the Government and private sectors covering the field of management, medicine, engineering, law and commercial courses. Each institute has been allocated five awards, with a ceiling of total 625 scholarships per year.

The family income of the ST students from all the sources should not exceed  $\geq 2$  lakh per annum. The ST students are awarded scholarship covering full tuition fee and other non-refundable dues in respect of Government/Government-funded institutions. However, there is a ceiling of  $\epsilon$  2 lakh per annum per student for private sector institutions and  $\frac{3.72}{1.5}$  lakh per annum per student for the private sector flying clubs for Commercial Pilot Training.

**9. Vocational Training in Tribal Areas** The main aim of this scheme is to upgrade the skills of the tribal youth in various traditional/modern vocations depending upon their educational qualification, present economic trends and the market potential, which would enable them to gain suitable employment or enable them to become self employed.

The scheme has been revised from 2009 and is being implemented through the State Governments/UT Administrations, Institutions or Organisations set up by Government as autonomous bodies, educational and other institutions like local bodies and cooperative societies and Non-Governmental Organisations etc.

The scheme covers all the States and Union Territories. The scheme is exclusively for benefit of the Scheduled Tribes as well as PTGs. As far as possible minimum 33% seats will be reserved from tribal girl candidates.

Each Vocational Training centre set up under the scheme may cater to a maximum of five trades and will provide training to 100 or more trainees, i.e., for one trade there should be at least 20 candidates. There is provision for monthly stipend and for raw material for the trainees.

#### **10. Pre-Matric Scholarship for Needy Scheduled Tribe Students Studying in Classes IX & X**

The objectives of the Scheme are to: (i) support parents of ST students for education of their wards studying in Classes IX and X so that the incidence of dropout, especially in transition from the elementary to secondary and during secondary stage of education, is minimised, and (ii) improve participation of ST students in Classes IX and X of Pre-Matric stage, so that they perform well and have a better chance of progressing to Post-Matric stages of education.

Scholarships are paid  $\omega$ , 150 per month for day scholars and  $\omega$ , 350 per month for hostellers, for a period of 10 months in a year. Books and ad-hoc grant are paid  $\omega$   $\rightarrow$  750 per year for day scholars and  $\sqrt{1000}$  per year for hostellers.

**11. Free Coaching for Scheduled Tribes** The scheme of free coaching of Scheduled Tribes (erstwhile Coaching & Allied) has been in operation since the Fourth Five Year Plan Period. The scheme was revised during the financial year 2007-08.

The scheduled tribes coming from deprived families and disadvantaged environment find it

difficult to compete with those coming from a socially and economically advantageous background. To promote a more level playing field, and give ST candidates a better chance to succeed in competitive examinations, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs supports a scheme of coaching for disadvantaged ST candidates in quality coaching institutions for various competitive examinations meant for admission into professional courses and recruitment for jobs in Civil Services/Public sector.

The scheme is implemented through State Governments/UT Administrations/Universities and reputed Professional Coaching Institutions which run Pre-examination Coaching Centres (PECs). There are efforts to shift the focus from Government run institutions to quality professional coaching institutions. The funds are provided per student cost basis. Union Territories, Universities and Private Institutions are provided assistance to the extent of 100% on a contractual basis, while state-run institutions are provided 80% assistance from the Ministry.

The funding includes the coaching fees (including the charges of faculty), advertisement charges, stipend to candidates and assistance for boarding/lodging to outstation students etc.

**12. Scheme of Strengthening Education among ST girls in Low Literacy Districts** This genderspecific scheme was introduced in 1993-94 for ST girls in low literacy pockets. The scheme has been revised in 2008-09.

The scheme aims to bridge the gap in literacy levels between the general female population and tribal women, through facilitating 100% enrolment of tribal girls in the identified districts or blocks, more particularly in naxal affected areas and in areas inhabited by Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (earlier known as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs), and reducing drop-outs at the elementary level by creating the required ambience for education.

The scheme lays emphasis on providing hostel facilities to enable the ST girls to attend regular schools and wherever schools are not available within five km distance, both schooling and hostel facilities are provided. Improvement of the literacy rate of tribal girls is essential to enable them to participate effectively in and benefit from, socio-economic development.

The scheme covers the 54 identified districts as indicated in the revised scheme where the ST population is 25% or more, and ST female literacy rate below 35%, as per 2001 census. Any other tribal block in a district, other than aforesaid 54 identified districts, which has scheduled tribe population 25% or above, and tribal female literacy rate below 35% as per 2001 census, is also covered.

**13. Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS)** With the objective of providing quality education to the tribal students, it was decided during 1997-98 to utilise a part of the grant under Article 275(1) of the Constitution of India for setting up of 100 Model Residential Schools from Class VI to Class XII. Till the end of Xth Plan 100 schools were sanctioned to 22 States, of which 92 are reported to be functional.

The schools were required to be operated in each state through an autonomous society formed for this purpose. In order to provide a uniform pattern of education in those schools and enable their students to compete effectively for higher education programmes (medical, technical etc.), these schools are mainly affiliated to State Boards. These schools have been named as Eklavya Model Residential Schools and envisaged on the lines of Navodaya Vidyalayas but with state-centered management.

# **B. Schemes of Economic Empowerment**

**1. Tribal Sub-Plan** The Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) strategy was developed for the rapid socioeconomic development of tribal people and was adopted for the first time in the Fifth Five Year Plan. The strategy adopted continues till this day and the salient features are given as follows.

- (i) Preparation of plan meant for the welfare and development of tribals within the ambit of a State or a UT plan is a part of the overall plan of a State or UT, and is therefore called a Sub-Plan.
- (ii) The funds provided under the Tribal Sub-Plan have to be at least equal in proportion to the ST population of each State or UT.
- (iii) Tribals and tribal areas of a State or a UT are given benefits under the TSP, in addition to what percolates from the overall Plan of a State/UT.
- (iv) The Sub-Plan should:
  - (a) Identify the resources for TSP areas;
  - (b) Prepare a broad policy framework for development; and,
  - (c) Define a suitable administrative strategy for its implementation.
- (v) The TSP strategy has been in operation in 22 States and 2 UTs.
- (vi) TSP concept is not applicable to the tribal majority States of Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland and in the UTs of Lakshadweep and Dadra & Nagar Haveli where tribals represent more than 60% of the population, since the Annual Plan in these States/UTs is itself a Tribal Plan.

The TSP strategy is expected to be followed in the Central Ministries/Departments also so that an adequate flow of funds in the Central Ministries/Departments is ensured.

The funds for tribal development under TSP are sourced from the following:

- (i) State Plans
- (ii) The Special area programmes of Special Central Assistance (SCA) to Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) and Grant under Article 275 (1) of the Constitution and, funds under other Schemes of the Ministry;
- (iii) Sectoral programmes of Central Ministries/Departments; and
- (iv) Institutional Finance.

**2. Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Plan (SCA to TSP)** This is a major programme administered by the Ministry and under this grant is provided to the States Governments based on annual allocation made by the Planning Commission. This is treated as an additive to the State Plan, for areas where State Plan provisions are not normally forthcoming to bring about economic development to tribals. The programme was launched during 1974 and till the end of the IX Five Year Plan, the SCA to TSP was meant for filling up critical gaps in the family-based incomegenerating activities of TSP.

From the Tenth Five Year Plan period, the objective and scope of SCA to TSP, was expanded to cover employment-cum-income generation activities and infrastructure incidental thereto. Besides family-based activities, other activities run by the Self-Help Groups (SHGs)/Community are also to be taken up. The ultimate objective of extending SCA to TSP is to boost the demand based incomegeneration programmes and thus raise the economic and social status of tribals.

The SCA is provided to the 22 Tribal Sub-Plan States and 2 Union Territories including the North Eastern States of Assam, Manipur, Sikkim and Tripura and two Union territories. However, since 2003-04 funds meant for UTs are being provided for in the budget of Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry is not concerned in the administration of funds in the UTs.

The SCA is released for economic development in the following areas and for the following population:

- (i) Integrated Tribal Development Project/Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDP/ITDA) areas (192 Nos.), which are generally contiguous areas of the size of at least tehsil or block or more in which the ST population is 50% or more of the total population;
- (ii) Modified Area Development Approach (MADA) pockets (259 Nos.), which are identified pockets having 50% or more ST population with a minimum population of 10,000;
- (iii) Clusters (82 Nos.), which are identified pockets having 50% ST population with a minimum population of 5,000;
- (iv) Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PTGs) (72 Nos.), characterised by a low rate of growth of population, pre-agricultural level of technology and extremely low level of literacy;
- (v) Dispersed tribal population those tribals who fall outside the categories (i) to (iv) above.

**3. Programme for Development of Forest Villages** Prior to Independence, habitations were set up in forest areas for secured availability of labour force for various forestry operations. Over the years, these habitations grew into villages. These villages are outside the revenue administration of the districts and have, therefore, missed the fruits of development. A process of conversion of these forest villages into revenue villages is underway. However, there are about 2,474 such identified forest villages in 12 States, which are managed by State Forest Departments. Most of the inhabitants in these villages are tribals. The level of development in these villages is not at par with rest of the areas in the State.

Development of forest villages estimated to be having about 2.5 lakh tribal families was one of the thrust areas of tribal development during the Tenth Five Year Plan. Accordingly, Planning Commission allocated  $\sqrt{450}$  crore to the Ministry of Tribal Affairs in the Tenth Five Year Plan for Development of Forest Villages with an average allocation of  $\bar{\tau}$  15 lakh per village. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs initiated the programme for Development of Forest Villages as an extension of the Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Plan (SCA to TSP).

Towards the end of Tenth Plan, a considered view was taken that the programme may be continued for a limited period during the XI Plan also, keeping in view the need for adequate developmental activities to be undertaken in these villages pending conversion into revenue villages. It was decided that an additional funding upto  $\frac{15}{2}$  lakh each would be provided to all those forest villages that have availed the first phase funding during the X Plan.

**4. Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution of India** In pursuance of the Constitutional obligation, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs provides Funds to State Government having Scheduled Tribe population through the Special Area programme 'Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution'.

Under this Special Area Programme, 100 percent grant is provided by the Ministry to meet the cost of such project for tribal development, undertaken by a State Government, for (a) raising the level of administration of Scheduled Areas to bring them at par with the rest of the state, and (b) for welfare of the tribal people. The grants are provided to the states on the basis of the percentage of ST
population in the State.

In this regard, the following guidelines have been laid down:

- (i) Prior to 2000-01, Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution of India used to be released as block grants to states. Since then, the fund is provided for taking up specific projects for creation and up gradation of critical infrastructure required to bring the tribal areas at par with the rest of the State.
- (ii) The states are to identify the areas/sectors critical to enhancement of the Human Development Index (HDI) and projects can be taken up for bridging gaps in critical infrastructure.
- (iii) People's participation in planning and implementation of schemes and projects has been envisaged in the guidelines. Due regard is to be given to the provisions of the *States Panchayats Acts*, and the PESA Act, 1996.
- (iv) Integrated and holistic approach for preparing micro plans for ITDP/MADA/Cluster through multi-disciplinary teams is also envisaged.
- (v) At least 30% projects are to be targeted to benefit women.
- (vi) Two per cent of the grants may be used for project management, training, MIS, administrative expenses, monitoring and evaluation.
- (vii) Up to 10% of the allocation to the state can be used with prior approval of the Ministry for the maintenance of infrastructure.
- (viii) Ten per cent of the total allocation of funds out of grants under Article 275 (1) of the Constitution is allocated as innovative grant.

**5. National Scheduled Tribes Finance and Development Corporation** The National Scheduled Tribes Finance and Development Corporation (NSTFDC) was incorporated in 2001 as a Government of India company under Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) and was granted license under the *Companies Act*, 1956 (a company not for profit). It is managed by the Board of Directors with representation from Central Government, State Channelising Agencies, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), Tribal Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (TRIFED) and eminent persons from the Scheduled Tribes.

The NSTFDC is an apex organisation under MoTA for providing financial assistance for the economic development of the Scheduled Tribes. The broad objectives of NSTFDC are:

**6. Tribal Co-operative Marketing Development Federation of India Ltd.** The Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India Limited (TRIFED) is a Multi-State Cooperative Society. It was set up in 1987 under the *Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act*, 1984 (now the *Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act*, 2002)

The TRIFED is now functioning both as a service provider and market developer for tribal products. Further in the role as a capacity builder, it imparts training to ST Artisans and Minor Forest Produce (MFP) gatherers.

This Ministry extends Grants-in-Aid to TRIFED under the Scheme "Market Development of Tribal Product" for undertaking the following four main activities:

- (i) Marketing Development Activities;
- (ii) Tribal MFP Gatherers' Training & Capacity Building;
- (iii) Tribal Artisans Training & Capacity Building; and
- (iv) Research & Development.

**7. Grants-in-Aid for Minor Forest Produce (MFP) Operations** In order to help tribals, the State Governments have established State-level Government Organisations like State Tribal Development Cooperative Corporations (STDCCs), Forest Development Corporations (FDCs), etc. with the mandate to purchase MFP from tribals paying them remunerative prices for their MFP.

The Central Sector Scheme of Grants-in-Aid for MFP Operations was launched in 1992-93 to help these State-level Organisations. Grants-in-Aid are extended to these Organisations under this Scheme through their respective State Governments for: -

- (i) increasing the quantum of MFP handled by setting off operational losses, if need be;
- (ii) strengthening the share capital base of the corporation for undertaking MFP operations thereby increasing the quantum of MFP presently handled;
- (iii) setting up of scientific warehousing facilities, wherever necessary;
- (iv) establishing processing industries for value addition with the objective of ensuring maximum returns on the MFPs for the tribals;
- (v) giving consumption loans to the tribals; and
- (vi) supplementing Research & Development (R&D) activities/efforts.

# **C. Schemes of Social Empowerment**

**1. Scheme of Grants-in-aid to Voluntary Organisations working for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes** The 'Grants-in-aid to Voluntary Organisations working for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes' scheme was launched in 1953-54 and is continuing. The prime objective of the scheme is to enhance the reach of welfare schemes of Government and fill the gaps in service deficient tribal areas, in the sectors such as education, health, drinking water, agro-horticultural productivity, social security net etc. through the efforts of voluntary organisations, and to provide an environment for socio-economic upliftment and overall development of the Scheduled Tribes (STs). Any other innovative activity having direct impact on the socio-economic development or livelihood generation of STs may also be considered through voluntary efforts.

The scheme is a Central Sector Scheme. The grants are provided to the eligible non-governmental organisations/autonomous societies for the categories of projects prescribed in the scheme. Funds are generally provided to the extent of 90% by the Government. The voluntary organisation is expected to bear the remaining 10% as contribution from its own resources. However, the extent of assistance under the scheme is 100% for those projects being implemented in the Scheduled Areas.

Many categories of projects have been prescribed under the scheme which may be considered for grant. The list of categories is as below:

**2. Scheme for Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups** In 1998-99, a separate 100% Central Sector Scheme for exclusive socio-economic development of PTGs was started. Based on the knowledge and experience gathered meanwhile, the scheme was revised in 2008-09, to make it more effective.

The scheme covers only the 75 identified Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups among Scheduled Tribes. The scheme is very flexible and it enables every State to focus on any area that they consider is relevant to their PTGs and their socio-cultural environment. Activities under it may include housing, land distribution, land development, agricultural development, cattle development, construction of link roads, installation of non-conventional sources of energy for lighting purpose, social security including Janshree Beema Yojana or any other innovative activity meant for the comprehensive socio-economic development of PTGs.

The funds under this scheme are made available for those items/activities which are very crucial for the survival, protection and development of PTGs and are not specifically catered to by any other scheme of State or Central Government.

The scheme is implemented by the State/UT through various agencies of the State Government/UT Administration like Integrated Tribal Development Projects (ITDPs)/Integrated Tribal Development Agencies (ITDAs), Tribal Research Institutes (TRIs), and also Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs).

**3. Grants-in-aid to Tribal Research Institutes** Under the scheme, so far 18 Tribal Research Institutes (TRIs) have been set up in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura and Union Territory of Andaman & Nicobar Islands.

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs releases 50% Central share to the State Governments and 100% to Union Territories for the Tribal Research Institutes, for meeting the expenses, including administrative costs. These institutes are engaged in the work of providing planning inputs to the State Governments, conducting research and evaluation studies, collection of data, conducting training, seminars and workshops, documentation of customary laws; setting up of tribal museum for exhibiting tribal artifacts, and other related activities.

As part of the research activities of the Tribal Research Institutes (TRIs), the Ministry also supports construction of tribal museums within the premises of the TRIs to preserve the tribal art, craft and material culture.

In order to effectively coordinate all the functions presently being carried out in Tribal Research Institutes (TRIs) throughout the country, as well as for new activities, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs has evolved the concept of Nodal TRI (NTRI). The NTRI is to provide policy inputs to the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, carry out and coordinate research and evaluation studies, and undertake other related activities for the TRIs which are clubbed under their charge.

**4. Supporting Projects of All-India or Inter-State Nature** This scheme is in operation since 1979-80 for dissemination of knowledge about tribal issues, and developmental schemes/works through study, seminars/workshops and publication of tribal literature. Under the scheme financial support is extended to Non-Governmental Organisations/Institutions/Universities on 100% basis for following:

- (i) Research and Evaluation studies,
- (ii) Workshops/Seminars helpful in orienting developmental programmes for the Scheduled Tribes and disseminating knowledge and experience concerning tribal people and their areas, and
- (iii) Publication of literature on tribal development.

For Research studies, assistance is provided to the Universities/Institutions/Non Governmental Organisations to carry out research/evaluation studies. The research grant is ordinarily given up to a maximum of  $\epsilon$  2.50 lakh for each project to be completed in a period of 8-12 months.

Grants-in-aid for workshops/seminars are released to Institutions/Non-Governmental Organisations/Universities or a group of institutions for organising workshops/seminars which help in disseminating research findings, identifying thrust areas, promoting arts, culture and tradition of tribal groups, issues relating to tribal development.

**5. Organisation of Tribal Festivals** The scheme 'Organisation of Tribal Festivals' envisages

increasing the participation of Scheduled Tribes in sports and culture at local, District, State and National levels by encouraging their inherent talent and ensuring participation at national and international events. Under the scheme cultural melas, festivals and sports meet are organised at the State and National level encouraging tribal artists/folk art performers and sports persons and preserving, promoting and disseminating tribal arts and traditional tribal sports.

The scheme addresses itself mainly to the well-identified and urgent need for creating awareness, promotion and dissemination of tribal art and culture and traditional sporting events. The Scheme also supports/provides grants to the state governments for organising tribal cultural festivals and traditional sports event, etc. in their own environment.

**6. Exchange of Visits by Tribals** Exchange of visits by the Scheduled Tribes (STs) is one of the ongoing schemes implemented by the Ministry with an endeavor to cultivate the spirit of oneness. It is specifically aimed at knowledge sharing and knowledge acquisition by both the host and the visiting tribal groups in order to emulate and draw lessons from best practices and lifestyles across states.

The objectives of the scheme of exchange of visits by tribals include inter-alia:

- (i) Enhancing the exposure of the Scheduled Tribes, including students and teachers, resulting in better appreciation of various development, welfare and educational programmes under implementation as well as cultural and social practices adopted across different States/Tribes.
- (ii) Acquainting the Scheduled Tribes with the latest techniques of agriculture, animal husbandry, processing of Non-Timber Forest Produce (NTFP), small scale industries, etc.
- (iii) Encouraging sports development and/or cultural programmes, thereby being catalytic in improving and harnessing their inherent talent.

## **WELFARE OF BACKWARD CLASSES**

The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MSJ  $\&$  E) is implementing various schemes and programmes for the welfare and development of Backward Classes (BCs)/Other Backward Classes (OBCs). These are explained below :

### **A. Schemes of Educational Empowerment**

**1. Pre-Matric Scholarship** The aim of this scheme is to motivate children of OBCs studying at prematric stage. As such, scholarships are awarded to students belonging to OBCs whose parents,/guardian's income from all sources does not exceed  $\frac{44,500}{2}$  per annum.

The scholarship is available in such institutions and for such pre-matriculation courses, which have been duly recognised by the concerned state governments and Union Territory Administrations. Under the scheme, 50% Central Assistance is provided to the state governments over and above their committed liability, while in case of UTs 100% central assistance is provided. However, North-East states are exempted from this committed liability under the Scheme.

**2. Post-Matric Scholarship** The scheme is intended to promote higher education by providing financial support to OBC students studying at post-matric/post-secondary levels including Ph.D. degrees. The scholarships are awarded through the State Government/UT Administration to which the

applicant belongs for study in recognised institutions. Under the scheme, 100% Central assistance is provided to State Governments/UT Administrations over and above their committed liability. The Scheme has been revised in 2011. The major changes effected under the Scheme are as under:

- (i) The parental income ceiling for eligibility has been raised from  $\frac{1}{3}$  44,500 to  $\frac{1}{3}$  1 lakh per annum.
- (ii) Increase in maintenance and other allowances of the OBC students.
- (iii) Regrouping of courses.

**3. Construction of Hostels for OBC Boys and Girls** The Scheme of Construction of Hostels for OBC Boys and Girls has been revised in 2010-11. The scheme aims at providing hostel facilities to students belonging to socially and educationally backward classes, especially from rural areas, to enable them to pursue secondary and higher education. The following important changes have been incorporated in the revised scheme:

- (i) Earlier, only State Governments, UT Administrations and Universities were eligible for Central assistance. Now, NGOs with a good track record are also eligible.
- (ii) Enhancement of Central assistance to North-Eastern states & Sikkim from 50% to 90%. However, in the case of other states, the Central assistance is restricted to 50% of the cost, while in the case of UTs and Central institutions, 100% Central funding is provided. In the case of NGOs, the funding pattern is 45% each by Central and state government and the balance 10% by the NGO. This funding pattern has been made with reference to the approved cost.
- (iii) Indicative physical norms have been laid down for a typical 100 seater hostel with a view to improving the quality and "livability" of hostels to be constructed henceforth, and to introduce a degree of uniformity in the physical norms across the country, and
- (iv) Introduction of a one-time non-recurring grant of  $\bar{\epsilon}$  2500 per seat for providing furniture/equipment to the hostels constructed under the scheme.

**4. Free Coaching for OBC Students** A scheme for providing free coaching to students belonging to Scheduled Castes (SCs) is being implemented since the Sixth Five Year Plan. Similar schemes are also being implemented to provide free coaching to students belonging to other backward classes (OBCs) and minorities. With a view to ensure effective implementation and monitoring and to assist the students in a better manner, the separate coaching schemes for SCs, OBCs and Minorities were amalgamated and a combined Scheme, namely Coaching and Allied Assistance for Weaker Sections including Scheduled Castes, Other Backward Classes and Minorities was introduced in 2001.

After creation of a separate Ministry to handle matters relating to the minorities, viz. the Ministry of Minority Affairs, the scheme underwent further revision in 2007 for removing the minority component from the ambit of the scheme. Again, the scheme was revised in 2012.

The objective of the Scheme is to provide coaching of good quality for economically disadvantaged Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) candidates to enable them to appear in Competitive examination and succeed in obtaining an appropriate job in Public/Private sector. The courses for which the coaching is imparted are as follows:

- (i) Group A and B examinations conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) and the various Railway Recruitment Boards (RRBs).
- (ii) Group A and B examinations conducted by the State Public Service Commissions.

- (iii) Officers' Grade examinations conducted by Banks, Insurance Companies and Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs).
- (iv) Premier Entrance Examinations for admission in (a) Engineering (eg., IIT-JEE & AIEEE), (b) Medical (eg., AIPMT), (c) professional courses like Management (eg., CAT) and Law (eg., CLAT) and (d) such other disciplines, Ministry may decide from time to time.
- (v) Finishing courses/Job oriented courses for employment in the private sector like IT, Bio-Technology etc. in need of soft skill and other professional courses specified by the Government from time to time.

The scheme is implemented through the reputed institutions/centres run by the:

- (i) Central Government/State Governments/UT Administrations/PSUs/autonomous bodies under Central/State Governments;
- (ii) Universities (both Central and State including the Deemed Universities in the private sector); and
- (iii) Registered private institutions/NGOs.

**5. National Overseas Scholarship for OBC candidates** The Scheme was started in the year 2014. It provides financial assistance to the finally selected candidates for pursuing Master level courses and Ph.D abroad in the following specified fields of study:

- (a) Engineering;
- (b) Management;
- (c) Agricultural Science; and
- (d) Medicine.

## **WELFARE OF MINORITIES**

In 1993, the Central Government notified five communities, viz., Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Zoroastrians (Parsis) as religious minorities at the national level. In January 2014, the Jain community was added to this list.

The Ministry of Minority Affairs (MoMA) is implementing various schemes and programmes for the welfare and development of minorities/minority communities. These are explained below :

## **A. Prime Minister's New 15 Point Programme for the Welfare of Minorities**

The Prime Minister's new 15-Point programme for the welfare of minorities was launched in 2006 and was amended in 2009. It is aimed at ensuring the well being, protection and development of minorities. While the 15-Point programme of the 1983 centred on communal riots, representation of minorities in services and ensuring flow of benefits to individual beneficiaries, the focus of the new Programme is to make certain that benefits of various schemes/programmes flow equitably to the minorities. For this, it envisages location of a certain proportion of development projects in areas with a concentration of minorities. It also stipulates that wherever possible, 15% of targets and outlays under various schemes should be earmarked for the minorities.

The objectives of the programme are: (a) Enhancing opportunities for education; (b) Ensuring an equitable share for minorities in economic activities and employment, through existing and new schemes, enhanced credit support for self-employment, and recruitment to state and Central Government jobs; (c) Improving the conditions of living of minorities by ensuring an appropriate share for them in infrastructure development schemes; and (d) Prevention and control of communal disharmony and violence.

The 15 provisions/components of the programme are as follows:

**1. Equitable Availability of ICDS Services** The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme is aimed at holistic development of children and pregnant/lactating mothers from disadvantaged section, by providing services through Anganwadi Centres such as supplementary nutrition , immunisation, health check-up, referral services, pre-school and non-formal education. A certain percentage of the ICDS projects and Anganwadi Centres will be located in blocks/villages with a substantial population of minority communities to ensure that he benefits of the scheme are equitable available to such communities also.

**2. Improving Access to School Education** Under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya Scheme, and other similar Government schemes, it will be ensured that a certain percentage of such school are located in villages/localities having a substantial population of minority communities.

**4. Modernising Madrasa Education** The Central Plan Scheme of Area Intensive and Madrasa Modernisation Programm provides basis educational infrastructure in areas of concentration of educationally backward minorities and resources for the modernisation of Madrasa education. Keeping in view of importance of addressing this need, this programme will be substantially strengthened and implemented effectively.

**6. Improving Educational Infrastructure Through the Maulana Azad Education Foundation** The Government shall provide all possible assistance to Maulana Azad Educaion Foundation (MAEF) to strengthen and enable it to expand its activities more effectively.

**7. Self-Employment and Wage Employment for the Poor** The Swarnjayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojna (SGSY), the primary self-employment programme for rural areas, has the objective fo bringing assisted poor rural families above the poverty line by providing them income generating assets through a mix of bank credit and Governmental subsidy. A certain percentage of the physical and financial targets under the SGSY will be earmarked for beneficiaries belonging to the minority communities living below the poverty line in rural areas.

The Swarn Jayanti Shahary Rohgar Yojna (SJSRY) consists of two major components namely, the Urban Self-Employment Programme (USEP) and the Urban Wage Employment Programme (UWEP). A certain percentage of the physical and financial targets under USEP and UWEP will be earmarked to benefit people below the poverty line from the minority communities.

**8. Upgradation of Skills Through Technical Training** A very large proportion of the population of minority communities is engaged in low-level technical work or earns its living as handicraftsmen.
Provision of technical training to such people would upgrade their skills and earning capability. Therefore, a certain proportion of all new ITIs will be located in areas predominantly inhabited by minority communities and a proportion of existing it is to be upgraded to 'Centres of Excellence' will be selected on the same basis.

**9. Enhanced Credit Support for Economic Activities** The National Minorities Development & Finance Corporation (NMDFC) was set up in 1994 with the objective of promoting economic development activities among the minority communities. The Government is committed to strengthen the NMDFC by providing it greater equity support to enable it to fully achieve its objectives.

Bank credit is essential for creation and sustenance of self-employment initiative. A target of 40% of net bank credit for priority sector lending has been fixed for domestic banks. The priority sector includes, inter alia, agricultural loans, loan to small-scale industries & small business, loans to retail trade, professional and self-employed persons, education loans, housing loans and micro-credit. It will be ensured that an appropriate percentage of the priority sector lending in all categories is targeted for the minority communities.

**10. Recruitment to State and Central Services** In the recruitment of police personnel, State Governments will be advised to give special consideration to minorities. For this purpose, the composition of selection committees should be representative.

The Central Government will take similar action in the recruitment of personnel to the Central police forces.

It would be ensured that the benefits of these programmes flow equitable to members of the minority communities and to cities/slums, predominantly inhabited by minority communities.

Under Urban Infrastructure and Governance (UIG) scheme, Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT) and National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), the Central Government provides assistance to States/UTs for provision of infrastructure and basic services. It would be ensured that the benefits of this programme flow equitably to cities/towns/districts/blocks having a substantial minority population.

**13. Prevention of Communal Incidents** In the areas, which have been identified as communally sensitive and riot prone districts and police officials of the highest known efficiency, impartiality and secular record must be posted. In such areas and even elsewhere, the prevention of communal tension should be one of the primary duties of the district magistrate and superintendent of police. Their performance in this regard should be an important factor in determining their promotion prospects.

**14. Prosecution for Communal Offences** Severe action should be taken against all those who incite communal tension or take part in violence. Special court or courts specifically earmarked to try communal offences should be set up so that offenders are brought to book speedily.

**7. Scheme of Support for Students Clearing Prelims** From 2013-14, the Ministry started financial support for minority candidates clearing Prelims exams conducted by Union Public Service Commission, Staff Selection Commission and State Public Service Commissions.

The representation of the Minority Communities in the Civil Services continue to be lower compared to the ratio of their population. Recruitment of minority candidates as reported by Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievance and Pensions, Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) was 8.23%; 9.90%; 7.28% and 11.9% in 2007-08; 2008-09; 2009-10; and 2010-11 respectively. This calls for policy intervention in the form of special support for minorities to clear the competitive Civil Services Examinations.

The objective of the Scheme is to provide financial support to the minority candidates clearing prelims conducted by Union Public Service Commission, Staff Selection Commission and State Public Service Commissions to adequately equip them to compete for appointment to Civil Services in the Union and the State Governments and to increase the representation of the minority in the Civil Services by giving direct financial support to candidates clearing Preliminary Examination of Group A and B (Gazetted and non-Gazetted posts of Union Public Service Commission (UPSC); State Public Service Commissions (SPSCs) and Staff Selection Commission (SSC), etc.

**8. Nalanda Project** "Nalanda Project" is an innovative Faculty Development Program of the Ministry for awareness, orientation and development of faculties of Minority Universities/Minority Managed Degree Colleges (MMDCs) and higher educational institutions located in minority concentration areas in the country. The Project has been launched under the scheme of

"Research/Studies, Monitoring, Evaluation of the Development Schemes including Publicity" in February 2014 at Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh (UP).

The Ministry is of firm conviction that to strengthen the efforts for educational development of minorities, it is also essential to organise orientations programs for teachers from time to time in addition to support to students. Though agencies like NCERT, NEUPA etc. are involved in such teachers training and development programs, yet Ministry considers that in case of minorities, more efforts are required to develop faculty of higher education institutions.

The need for faculty development programs in higher education is immense for several reasons, viz., increases in the complexity of higher education; demands from internal and external constituencies and the necessity to balance teaching, scholarship, service, and personal responsibilities. Faculty development is a process through which faculty enhance their teaching and research base in an effort to become a more effective teacher, scholar and contributor to academic and professional communities.

The aims and objectives of the project are mentioned below:

- (i) To inspire, stimulate, and motivate faculty to go beyond usual routines.
- (ii) To help them understand student perspectives.
- (iii) To introduce varied approaches to teaching and learning.
- (iv) To integrate these in to their repertoire of knowledge and skills.
- (v) To integrate modern pedagogy and higher education system with information technology skills to meet the global standards.

## **9. Padho Pardesh (Scheme of Interest Subsidy on Educational Loans for Overseas Studies)**

"Padho Pardesh" is the new scheme of the Ministry launched in 2013-14, wherein the Ministry provides interest subsidy to minority students who avail loans from banks for overseas studies. The scheme of Interest Subsidy on educational loans for overseas studies promotes educational advancement of student from minority communities.

The objective of the scheme is to award interest subsidy to meritorious students belonging to economically weaker sections of notified minority communities so as to provide them better opportunities for higher education abroad and enhance their employability.

This is a Central Sector-Scheme to provide interest subsidy to the student belonging to the minority communities on the interest payable for the period of moratorium for the education loans under the Scheme of interest subsidy on Educational Loans for Overseas Studies to pursue approved courses of studies abroad at Masters and Ph.D levels.

The Scheme is applicable for higher studies abroad. The interest subsidy is linked with the existing Educational Loan Scheme of Indian Banks' Association (IBA) and restricted to students enrolled for courses at Masters, M.Phil and Ph.D levels. The interest subsidy under the scheme is available to the eligible students only once, either for Masters or Ph.D levels.

## **C. Schemes of Socio-Economic Empowerment**

**1. Identification of Minority Concentration Districts (MCDs)** In 1987, a list of 41 minority concentration districts was drawn up based on a single criterion of minority population of 20 percent or more in a district as per 1971 Census for enabling focused attention of government programmes and schemes on these districts.

In order to ensure that the benefits of schemes and programmes of government reach the relatively disadvantaged segments of society, it was decided to identify districts on the basis of minority population of Census 2001 and backwardness parameters. A fresh exercise was, therefore, carried out based on population figures and the following backwardness parameters of 2001 Census:

Religion-specific socio-economic indicators at the district level:

- (i) literacy rate;
- (ii) female literacy rate;
- (iii) work participation rate; and
- (iv) female work participation rate.

Basic amenities indicators at the district level:

- (i) percentage of households with pucca walls;
- (ii) percentage of households with safe drinking water;
- (iii) percentage of households with electricity; and
- (iv) percentage of households with water closet latrines.

The process of identification of minority concentration districts has been carried out as follows:-

- (a) Districts with a 'substantial minority population' of at least 25% of the total population (i) were identified in 29 States/UTs.
  - (b) Districts having a large absolute minority population exceeding 5 lakh and the percentage of minority population exceeding 20% but less than 25% were identified in 29 States/UTs.
  - (c) In the six States/UTs, where a minority community is in majority, districts having 15% of minority population, other than that of the minority community in a majority in that State/UT were identified.
- (ii) Thereafter, the position of these districts in terms of "backwardness" was evaluated against the two sets of socio-economic and basic amenities indicators. 90 Minority Concentration Districts (MCDs) having a substantial minority population, which are relatively backward and falling behind the national average in terms of socio-economic and basic amenities indicators, have been identified in 2007 based on population data and the backwardness parameters of 2001 Census.

The Government while approving the identification of 90 MCDs directed for implementation of a special area development programme. To sharpen the focus on minority concentration areas and to extend the benefit to other deserving areas, the Ministry is proposing to identify the blocks and towns having substantial minority population during 12th Five Year Plan.

**2. Scheme of Multi-Sectoral Development Programme** The Multi-Sectoral Development Programme (MsDP) was launched in 2008-09. The programme aims at improving the socio-economic and basic amenity facilities for improving the quality of life of the people and reducing imbalances in the Minority Concentration Districts (MCDs).

The identified 'development deficits' are addressed through a district specific plan for provision of better infrastructure for school and secondary education, sanitation, pucca housing, drinking water and electricity supply, besides beneficiary oriented schemes for creating income generating activities.

The absolutely critical infrastructure linkages like connecting roads, basic health infrastructure, ICDS centers, skill development and marketing facilities required for improving living conditions and income generating activities and catalysing the growth process are eligible for inclusion in the plan. The focus of this programme is on rural and semi-rural areas of the identified 90 minority concentration districts.

The programme is implemented by the Department in the State/UT dealing with minority affairs/welfare. Panchayati Raj Institutions/urban local bodies are involved in the implementation of the MsDP wherever the mechanism is established. The State may, however, decide to execute the project through any qualified, reputed, experienced agency, including renowned and widely accepted NGOs.

As far as possible, the focus of the programme is on providing appropriate social and economic infrastructure rather than targeting individual beneficiaries. In case schemes for individual benefits are taken up under the programme, there will be no divergence from existing norms for selection of beneficiaries from the list of BPL families in the district, so that benefits from the additional funds flow to all BPL families and not selectively to families of minority communities.

Financial assistance are sanctioned to the State Government/UT administration concerned on 100% grant basis in two installments linked with the satisfactory progress made as per approved plan. Funds under the programme are released to the states/UTs only against the approved district development plans. Once the proposal is approved for support by the Ministry of Minority Affairs, the first installment is released. State share wherever applicable is given by the State Government.

**3. Nai Roshni (Scheme for Leadership Development of Minority Women)** The scheme of Leadership Development of Minority Women (Nai Roshni) is a new initiative of the Ministry in the area of gender empowerment. The Ministry has started implementation of this scheme from the year 2012-13. The objective of the programme is to empower and instill confidence in women, by providing knowledge, tools and techniques for interacting with Government systems, banks, and intermediaries at all levels so that they are emboldened to move out of the confines of home and community and assume leadership roles and assert their rights, collectively and individually, in accessing services, facilities, skills and opportunities besides claiming their due share of development benefits for improving their lives and living conditions.

The eligible women belonging to notified minority communities are the target group. However, to further strengthen the mosaic of plurality in the society and bring about solidarity and unity through their own efforts to improve their lot, the scheme permits a mix of women from non-minority communities not exceeding 25% of a project proposal.

The scheme is implemented through registered Civil Societies, Public Trusts, Private Limited Non-Profit Companies, Universities/Institutions recognised by University Grants Commission (UGC) and Training Institutes of Central and State Government including Panchayati Raj institutions.

The leadership training modules invariably cover issues and rights of women, relating to education, employment, livelihood etc. under the Constitution and various Acts; opportunities, facilities and services available under schemes and programmes of the Central Government and state government in the fields of education, health, hygiene, nutrition, immunisation, family planning, disease control, fair price shop, drinking water supply, electricity supply, sanitation, housing, selfemployment, wage employment, skill training opportunities, crimes against women, etc.

The organisation implementing the scheme are required to visit the village/locality periodically for providing nurturing/handholding service to the group of women imparted leadership development training so that they are guided in the use of tools and techniques taught to them and are able to extract the benefit from their efforts.

Villages/urban localities in rural/urban areas having a substantial percentage of minority

population are selected by the organisation for conducting the leadership development training programme. Organisation selected for carrying out training for leadership development of minority women has the responsibility to motivate, identify and select women to be trained in accordance with the criteria of the scheme from villages/localities having a substantial minority population. Although there is no annual income bar, woman/parent or guardian of woman having annual income not exceeding 2.50 lakh from all sources would be given preference in selection. They should be between the age group of 18 years to 65 years.

Under the scheme, two kinds of trainings namely, Non-Residential and Residential are supported by the Ministry in a batch of 25 women each. The training programme is for one week only. The Ministry provides financial assistance of  $\sqrt{71550}$  for Non-Residential training per batch and  $\sqrt{71550}$ 221250 for Residential training per batch.

## **4. Research/Studies, Monitoring and Evaluation of Development Schemes Including Publicity**

The Ministry under the Central Sector Scheme 'Scheme of Research/Studies, Monitoring and Evaluation of Development Schemes including Publicity' provides professional charges to those institutions/Organisations which have the expertise and are willing to undertake purposeful studies on the problems, issues and requirement of notified minorities including baseline survey/surveys and also carrying out concurrent monitoring on the implementation of various schemes undertaken for minorities. Financial support is also extended to organisation(s) for holding Workshop/Seminar/Conference provided the theme of workshop/seminar/conference has direct relevance to the mandate of the Ministry.

The scheme also provides to carry out multi-media campaign involving print media, electronic media, outdoor publicity, etc. for dissemination of information to generate awareness relating to programmes, schemes and initiatives undertaken for notified minorities.

During 2012-13, the Ministry empanelled 37 expert Organisations to carry out research studies, base line surveys, concurrent monitoring, evaluation and impact assessment of the programmes of the Ministry.

**5. Scheme for Computerisation of the Records of the State Waqf Boards** The Waqf properties are spread out all over the country but effective survey of Waqf properties has not been carried out in most states. There is scope for large scale development of Waqf properties to ensure substantial income for the welfare schemes of the community.

In order to streamline record keeping of the Waqf lands, introduce transparency and social audit and to computerise the various functions/processes of the Waqf Boards and to develop a single web based centralised application, the scheme for computerisation of the records of the State Waqf Boards with the help of Central financial assistance was launched in 2009.

The broad objectives of the scheme for computerisation of Management of Waqf properties are as follows:-

- (a) Properties Registration Management.
- (b) Muttawalli Returns Management.
- (c) Leasing of Properties Management.
- (d) Litigations Tracking Management.
- (e) Documents Archiving & Retrieval Management.
- (f) GIS of Waqf Properties.

- (g) Funds Management to Mosques, Durgah, Kabristan, Imams, Muzzins, widows, girls marriages, scholarships, schools, hospitals, dispensaries, musafirkhanas, skill development centres etc.
- (h) Loans Management for development of Urban Waqf properties.

**6. National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation** The National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation (NMDFC) was incorporated in 1994 as a non-profit company under the *Companies' Act*, 1956. NMDFC provides concessional loans for self-employment and income generating activities to persons of minority communities, having a family income below double the poverty line which at present is  $\frac{1}{2}$  55,000 per annum and  $\frac{1}{2}$  40,000 per annum in urban and rural areas respectively. NMDFC provides loans through (i) State Channelising Agencies (SCAs) nominated by the respective State/UT Governments and (ii) through Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). The following are the schemes run by NMDFC:

- (i) The scheme of Term Loan is implemented through SCAs, for individual beneficiaries, wherein projects costing up to  $\frac{1}{2}$  5 lakh are financed.
- (ii) Under the Educational Loan Scheme implemented through the SCAs, NMDFC provides 2,50,000 to the eligible candidates belonging to minority communities.
- (iii) Under micro financing scheme, implemented through SCAs as well as NGOs, microcredit up to 25,000 is being given to each of the members of the Minority Self Help Groups (SHGs).
- (iv) In addition, NMDFC is also implementing schemes of Vocational Training and Marketing Assistance through the SCAs for capacity building of the target groups for self employment as well as wage employment.

**7. Grants-in-Aid Scheme to State Channelising Agencies** The National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation implements its schemes through the State Channelising Agencies (SCAs). These agencies are nominated by the respective state governments. The SCAs identify beneficiaries, channelise the lending and make recoveries from the beneficiaries. However, most of the State Channelising Agencies have a very weak infrastructure leading to a weak delivery system. Consequently, the performance and the ambit of coverage of NMDFC may not improve unless the infrastructure of these agencies is improved.

The Ministry launched a scheme of Grants-in-Aid for improving the infrastructure of the SCAs during 2007-08. Under the scheme, assistance is provided on matching basis, the Central and the state govt. contributing in the ratio of 90:10.

**8. National Waqf Development Corporation** The Ministry has set up a new National Waqf Development Corporation (NAWADCO) in January, 2014. This is an initiative to finance the development of Waqf properties for public purposes throughout the country.

The setting up of NAWADCO would facilitate and mobilise financial resources for provision of amenities like schools, colleges, hospitals on Waqf properties for community purposes.

India has the largest number of Waqf properties in the world. The Prime Minister's High Level Committee on the Social, Economic and Educational Status of Muslim Community of India (also known as the Sachar Committee) in its report published in 2006 had mentioned that there are more than 4.9 lakhs registered auqaf spread over the country but the current annual income from these properties is only about  $\sqrt{163}$  crores.

Many of these Auqaf (Waqf Properties/Assets) are on prime urban land and they have the potential
of generating considerable returns for fulfilling the objectives of the auqaf. The Sachar Committee had estimated that such properties, if properly developed, with a minimum return of 10%, would have potential of generating an income of about  $\frac{12000}{12000}$  crore per annum.

The Corporation has an authorised share capital of  $\epsilon$  500 crore with initial paid up capital of  $\epsilon$ 100 crore only. The contribution of National Minorities Development & Finance Corporation (NMDFC) in the authorised share capital of the corporation is 49%. The Central Waqf Council (CWC) and the individual Waqf Institutions and the Public have 9% and 42% shares respectively.

**9. Minority Cyber Gram** The Ministry has launched a pilot project "Minority Cyber Gram" for Digital literacy of Monirities in collaboration with Digital Empowerment Foundation in PPP Mode at village Chandauli, District Alwar, Rajasthan, in February 2014. Total 2,600 villagers have been targeted under this pilot project.

The MCGY programme seeks to introduce digital literacy skills in identified minority clusters in India through designated Digital Fellows towards knowledge empowerment and entitlement gains of minority focused groups and beneficiaries.

With basic literacy level low among the backward sections of the minorities, the social and economic profile is further aggravated due to lack of basic digital skills and knowledge to derive advantages from digital tools, devices, platforms and knowledge networks. In order to mainstream minority groups and communities with national development goals and objectives, it is extremely important and relevant to deploy and introduce digital literacy skills to get benefits in knowledge based networks and in public schemes and other services through information empowerment.

The objectives of the scheme are as follows:

- (i) To impart digital literacy and skills among identified minority groups and beneficiaries through designated Digital Fellows (DFs) in identified minority clusters for information and knowledge empowerment and entitlement gains.
- (ii) To provide opportunities in information and knowledge networks for local communities.

**10. Jiyo Parsi (Scheme for Containing Population Decline of Parsis)** The Ministry has launched a unique scheme with the name "Jiyo Parsi" during 2013-14 for containing population decline of Parsis in India. The scheme is being implemented with participation of Parzor Foundation, Bombay Parsi Panchayat and local Anjumans.

The studies conducted by the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) and the joint studies conducted by Parzor Foundation and Tata Institute of Social Science (TISS), have identified the following reasons as the important causes for decline in population of Parsis:

- (a) Late and non-marriages;
- (b) Fertility decline;
- (c) Emigration;
- (d) Out-Marriages; and
- (e) Separation and divorces

There has been a demand from the members of Parsi community for Government intervention to arrest the declining trend. In view of this, the Government of India considered it necessary to intervene immediately to arrest the declining trend of population of Parsi community and reverse it to bring their population above the threshold level.

The objective of the scheme is to reverse the declining trend of Parsi population by adopting a

scientific protocol and structured interventions, stabilise their population and increase the population of Parsis in India. The target groups within the Parsi community for the infertility treatment are as follows:

- (i) Parsi married couples of child bearing age who seek assistance under the scheme.
- (ii) Adults/young men/women/adolescent boys/girls for detection of diseases resulting in infertility.

**11. Seekho aur Kamao (Scheme for Skill Development of Minorities)** The Ministry has launched a new scheme "Seekho aur Kamao (Learn & Earn) for skill development of minorities during 2013- 14. The scheme guarantees minimum 75% employment of trained minority youths and out of them 50% would be in organised sector. The Ministry has sanctioned  $\epsilon$  17 crore for skill development training of 20,164 minority youths in 29 states through 32 expert skill development organisations.

The objectives of the scheme are as follows:

- (i) To bring down unemployment rate of minorities during Twelfth Plan period.
- (ii) To conserve and update traditional skills of minorities and establish their linkages with market.
- (iii) To improve employability of existing workers, school dropouts etc. and ensure their placement.
- (iv) To generate means of better livelihood for marginalised minorities and bring them in the mainstream.
- (v) To enable minorities to avail opportunities in the growing market.
- (vi) To develop potential human resource for the country.

The scheme aims at upgrading the skills of the minority youths in various modern/traditional vocations depending upon their educational qualification, present economic trends and the market potential, which can earn them a suitable employment or make them suitably skilled to go for self employment.

The Ministry took up skill development programme for Modular Employable Skills (MES) which are approved by National Council of Vocational Training (NCVT). The MES courses approved by NCVT include majority of traditional skills being practiced by the minority communities e.g. Embroidery, Chikankari, Zardosi, Patch work, Gem and Jewelry, Weaving, Wooden works, Leather goods, Brass metal works, Glass wares, Carpet etc. Moreover, other courses approved by NCVT may also be taken up in a particular state or region depending on the demand and local market potential. This would help, on one hand to conserve the traditional arts and crafts practiced by minorities and on the other hand empower the minority communities to face the market challenges and avail opportunities.

# **WELFARE OF DISABLED PERSONS**

The Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment (MSJ & E) is operating various schemes for empowerment and rehabilitation of disabled persons/persons with disabilities (PwDs).

#### **6. Establishment of Sign Language Training & Research Centre**

The Eleventh Five Year Plan document envisaged that "The needs of persons with hearing and/or speech impairment have been relatively neglected so far. In the Eleventh Plan, a determined effort will be made on mainstreaming this segment. The interventions planned will provide access to information in all its forms. A large number of sign language interpreters need to be developed for hearing impaired people to access health, employment and legal services. Subtitling and captioning of

all recorded information and similar support services is also essential. Therefore, during the Eleventh Plan period a Sign Language Research and Training Centre will be established which will be devoted to the development and promotion of sign language of teachers and interpreters".

The Ministry has in 2011, approved the establishment of an Indian Sign Language Research  $\&$ Training Centre (ISLRTC), initially on project basis for a period of five years, as an autonomous Centre of the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), New Delhi. The aim of the ISLRTC is to promote the use and spread of Indian Sign Language in cooperation with native sign language users through a comprehensive range of activities including research, teaching materials and curriculum development, outreach and awareness programmes, thereby improving the provision of interpreting and translation services for education, employment, and inclusion of the Deaf community in India.

#### **7. Composite Regional Centres (CRCs)**

Consequent to the enactment of the *Persons with Disability Act* (PWD), 1995 which enjoins upon the government a responsibility for taking up steps for providing an enabling environment for Persons with Disabilities, Scheme of setting up CRCs was formulated. The scheme of setting up of Composite Regional Centres is a part of overall strategy to reach out to the persons with disabilities in the country and to facilitate the creation of the required infrastructure and capacity building at Central, State and District levels and below for awareness generation, training of rehabilitation professionals, service delivery, etc.

It was thought that initiative from the Central Government is necessary by supporting establishment of CRCs in order to speed up the process of establishing rehabilitation services and sharing with the State Government the innovative model of services developed by National Institutes, Regional Rehabilitation and Training Centres, DDRCs, etc and also to do capacity building, to establish, strengthen and upgrade rehabilitation services to reach unreached disabled population. Centres were proposed to be set up at locations where the existing infrastructure for providing comprehensive services to disabled were inadequate and where such centres are needed the most.

At the beginning of 2011-12, there were six CRCs functioning at Sundernagar (Himachal Pradesh), Srinagar (Jammu & Kashmir), Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh), Guwahati (Assam), Patna (Bihar) and Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh). Two new CRCs have been sanctioned for setting up at Ahmadabad (Gujarat) and Kozhikode, Kerala. CRC Ahmadabad (Gujarat) has become functional from August, 2011 and CRC Kozhikode (Kerala) from February, 2012.

#### **8. District Disability Rehabilitation Centres**

## **4. Assistance to Voluntary Organisations for Prevention of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse**

The 'Scheme of Assistance for the Prevention of Alcoholism & Substance (Drugs) Abuse and for Social Defence Services' is the flagship scheme of the Ministry in the field of drug demand reduction. The Scheme has two parts viz. (i) 'Assistance for the Prevention of Alcoholism & Substance (Drugs) Abuse' (Part I) and (ii) 'Financial Assistance in the Field of Social Defence' (Part II).

The Scheme of Assistance for the Prevention of Alcoholism and Substance (Drugs) Abuse is being implemented for identification, counseling, treatment and rehabilitation of addicts through voluntary and other eligible organisations. Under this scheme, financial assistance up to 90% of the approved expenditure is given to the voluntary organisations and other eligible agencies for setting up/running Integrated Rehabilitation Centre for Addicts (IRCAs), Regional Resource and Training Centres (RRTCs), for holding Awareness-cum-de-addiction camps (ACDC) and Workplace Prevention Programmes etc. In the case of North-Eastern states, Sikkim and Jammu & Kashmir, the quantum of assistance is 95% of the total admissible expenditure. The balance has to be borne by the implementing agency.

The important features of the scheme are mentioned as follows:

- (i) the honorarium rates for service providers of the Integrated Rehabilitation Centres for Addicts (IRCA) projects have been enhanced,
- (ii) provision for food for inmates who are below poverty line (BPL) has been introduced at the rate of  $\epsilon$  900 per month per inmate,
- (iii) Panchayati Raj Institutions/Urban Local Bodies have been included under the organisations/institutions eligible for receiving assistance under the scheme, and

Training is an important component for capacity building and skill development for the service providers. It is important to have exposure to the new trends regarding the kind of drugs abused, medical and psychiatric problems, new medicines/methodologies available for the treatment of addiction through participation in training programmes and conferences.

A National Centre for Drug Abuse Prevention (NCDAP) was established in 1998, in the National Institute of Social Defence (NISD) at New Delhi to serve as an apex body for training, research and documentation in the field of alcoholism and drug demand reduction.

#### **7. Regional Resource and Training Centres (RRTC)**

Ten Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), with long years of experience and expertise in treatment, rehabilitation, training and research have been designated as Regional Resource and Training Centres (RRTCs) for different regions of the country.
