A National Policy on Voluntary Organisations (VOs) was announced in 2007. It aims to further strengthen, promote and develop such institutions.

As per this policy, by 'VOs' are meant organisations engaged in public service, based on ethical, cultural, social, economic, political, religious, spiritual, philanthropic or scientific and technological considerations. VOs include formal as well as informal groups, such as: community-based organisations (CBOs), non-governmental development organisations (NGDOs), charitable organisations, support organisations, networks or federations of such organisations, as well as professional membership associations.

To be covered under the policy, VOs should broadly have the following characteristics:

- (b) They do not return the profits generated to their owners or directors
- (c) They are self-governing, i.e., not controlled by Government
- (d) They are registered organisations or informal groups, with defined aims and objectives.

The specific objectives of the policy are listed below:

- 1. To create an enabling environment for VOs that stimulates their enterprise and effectiveness, and safeguards their autonomy
- 2. To enable VOs to legitimately mobilise necessary financial resources from India and abroad
- 3. To identify systems by which the Government may work together with VOs, on the basis of the principles of mutual trust and respect, and with shared responsibility
- 4. To encourage VOs to adopt transparent and accountable systems of governance and management

#### **NATIONAL POLICY ON RESETTLEMENT AND REHABILITATION**

A National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation was notified in 2004. This policy laid down immediate provisions for resettlement and rehabilitation of affected families, and the States, public sector undertakings or public bodies were free to offer better packages.

## **NATIONAL POLICY FOR CHILDREN**

The first National Policy for Children was adopted in 1974. This policy was revised and replaced by a new policy in 2013.

The new National Policy for Children (2013) reaffirms the government's commitment to the realisation of the rights of all children in the country. It recognises every person below the age of eighteen years as a child and that childhood is an integral part of life with a value of its own, and a long term, sustainable, multi-sectoral, integrated and inclusive approach is necessary for the harmonious development and protection of children.

The policy lays down twelve guiding principles that must be respected by national, state and local governments in their actions and initiatives affecting children. They are :

- 1. Every child has universal, inalienable and indivisible human rights.
- 2. The rights of children are interrelated and interdependent.
- 3. Every child has the right to life, survival, development, education, protection and participation.
- 4. Right to life, survival and development goes beyond the physical existence of the child and also encompasses the right to identity and nationality.
- 5. The mental, emotional, cognitive, social and the cultural development of the child are to be addressed in totality.
- 6. All children have equal rights and no child shall be discriminated.
- 7. The best interest of the child is of primary concern in all decisions and actions affecting the child.
- 8. The family environment is most conducive for the all-round development of children.
- 9. Every child has the right to a dignified life, free from exploitation.
- 10. Children are to be protected from all forms of harm, abuse, neglect, violence, maltreatment and exploitation in all settings.
- 11. Children must be provided the opportunity to express their views in matters affecting them.
- 12. Children's views are to be given due consideration in accordance with their age, maturity and evolving capacities.

The policy has identified survival, health, nutrition, education, development, protection and participation as the undeniable rights of every child, and has also declared these as key priority areas.

As children's needs are multi-sectoral, interconnected and require collective action, the policy aims at purposeful convergence and strong coordination across different sectors and levels of

governance; active engagement and partnerships with all stakeholders; setting up of a comprehensive and reliable knowledge base; provision of adequate resources; and sensitisation and capacity development of all those who work for and with children.

The policy provides for the formulation of a National Plan of Action for Children and the constitution of a National Coordination and Action Group for Children to monitor the progress of implementation.

### **NATIONAL POLICY FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES**

The National Policy for Persons with Disabilities was adopted in 2006. It recognises that persons with disabilities are a valuable human resource for the country and seeks to create an environment that provides them equal opportunities, protection of their rights and full participation in society.

The policy emphasises upon the fact that a majority of persons with disabilities can lead a better quality of life if they have equal opportunities and effective access to rehabilitation measures.

The salient features of the policy are:

- 1. Physical rehabilitation, which includes early detection and intervention, counseling and medical interventions and provision of aids and appliances
- 2. Educational rehabilitation which includes vocational training
- 3. Economic rehabilitation, for a dignified life in society. It includes employment in the public as well as private sector and self-employment

# **NATIONAL YOUTH POLICY**

The first National Youth Policy was adopted in 1988. This policy was revised and replaced by another policy in 2003.

The changing scenario in the country due to globalisation, rapid technological advancement and the emergence of India as a global economic power necessitated a review of the 2003 policy. Accordingly, a new revised/modified policy was notified in 2014.

The vision of NYP-2014 is "to empower the youth of the country to achieve their full potential, and through them enable India to find its rightful place in the community of nations". In order to achieve this vision, all stakeholders must work towards meeting five key objectives. This requires specific action in eleven priority areas, identified as important for youth development. The following table lists these objectives and priority areas:

|                | <b>Objectives</b>                                                                                            |       | <b>Priority Areas</b>            |

**Table 2.1** Objectives and Priorities of National Youth Policy (2014)

In the 2003 policy, 'youth' was defined as a person of age between 13-35 years, but in the 2014 policy, the youth age-group is defined as 15-29 years with a view to have a more focused approach, as far as various policy interventions are concerned.

### **NATIONAL POLICY ON EDUCATION**

A National Policy on Education (NPE) was adopted in 1986 and this was modified/revised in 1992. The modified policy envisages a National System of Education to bring about uniformity in education, making adult education programmes a mass movement, providing universal access to education, retention of students and quality in elementary education, special emphasis on education of girls, establishment of pace-setting schools like Navodaya Vidyalayas in each district, vocationalisation of secondary education, synthesis of knowledge and inter-disciplinary research in higher education, starting more Open Universities in the states, strengthening of the All-India Council of Technical Education, encouraging sports, physical education, *yoga* and adoption of an effective evaluation method, etc. Besides, a decentralised management structure had also been suggested to ensure popular participation in education.

The National System of Education as envisaged in the NPE is based on a national curricular framework, which envisages a common core along with other flexible and region-specific components. While the policy stresses on widening of opportunities for the people, it calls for consolidation of the existing system of higher and technical education. It also emphasises upon the need for a much higher level of investment in education of at least six per cent of the national income.

The Policy also envisages that the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) will play a pivotal role in reviewing educational development, determining the changes required to improve upon the system and monitoring implementation, and will function through appropriate mechanisms created to ensure contact with, and coordination among, the various areas of human resource development.

#### **NATIONAL POLICY ON CHILD LABOUR**

A National Policy on Child Labour was formulated in 1987. It contains the action plan for tackling the problem of child labour. It envisages:

- 1. A legislative action plan for strict enforcement of Child Labour Act and other labour laws
- 2. Focusing and convergence of general development programmes for benefiting working children wherever possible
- 3. Project-based plan of action for launching of projects for the welfare of working children in areas of high concentration of child labour

In pursuance of the above policy, the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme was started in 1988 to rehabilitate the working children. The Scheme seeks to adopt a sequential approach with a focus on rehabilitation of children working in hazardous occupations and processes in the first instance. Under the Scheme, after a survey of child labour engaged in hazardous occupations and processes has been conducted, children are to be withdrawn from these occupations and processes and then put into special schools in order to enable them to be mainstreamed into formal schooling system.

#### **NATIONAL POLICY ON DISASTER MANAGEMENT**

### **NATIONAL POLICY ON OPEN STANDARDS FOR E-GOVERNANCE**

The Government of India (GoI) has taken major initiatives to accelerate the development and implementation of e-Governance and to create right environments for introducing G2G, G2B, G2E and G2C services within the country.

A National Policy on Open Standards for e-Governance was notified in November 2010. It provides a set of guidelines for the consistent, standardised and reliable implementation of e-Governance solutions. It has been designed to ensure seamless interoperability of various e-Governance solutions developed by multiple agencies. It also aims to improve the technology choices available and avoid vendor lock-in.

The policy is applicable to all systems used for e-Governance. All standards used in any new e-Governance Systems (including all inter-department and intra-department systems) and Government to public (including businesses) systems must adhere to this policy. For legacy systems, it must be ensured that interface with other systems from the legacy system must adhere to this policy. The designated body/agencies responsible for standardisation would apply the principles of this policy while adopting/evolving standards.

The GoI shall adopt Single and Royalty-Free (RF) Open Standard progressively for a "specific purpose within a domain" ("area"), to meet the laid down objectives of the policy.

An Identified Standard will qualify as an "Open Standard" if it meets the following criteria:

- 1. Specification document of the Identified Standard shall be available with or without a nominal fee
- 2. The patent claims necessary to implement the Identified Standard shall be made available on a Royalty-Free basis for the life time of the Standard
- 3. Identified Standard shall be adopted and maintained by a not-for-profit organisation, wherein all stakeholders can opt to participate in a transparent, collaborative and consensual manner
- 4. Identified Standard shall be recursively open as far as possible
- 5. Identified Standard shall have technology-neutral specification
- 6. Identified Standard shall be capable of supporting all Indian official languages

### **NATIONAL HEALTH POLICY**

The first National Health Policy (NHP) of 1983 was a response to the commitment to the Alma Ata declaration to achieve "Health for All by 2000". It was revised in 2002.

The National Health Policy of 2002 (NHP-2002) was formulated with the following objectives:

- 1. The main objective of this policy is to achieve an acceptable standard of good health amongst the general population of the country.
- 2. The approach is to increase access to the decentralized public health system by establishing

new infrastructure in deficient areas, and by upgrading the infrastructure in the existing institutions.

- 3. Overriding importance is given to ensuring a more equitable access to health services across the social and geographical expanse of the country.
- 4. Emphasis is given to increasing the aggregate public health investment through a substantially increased contribution by the Central Government. It is expected that this initiative will strengthen the capacity of the public health administration at the state level to render effective service delivery.
- 5. The contribution of the private sector in providing health services is much enhanced, particularly for the population group which can afford to pay for services.
- 6. Primacy is given to preventive and first-line curative initiatives at the primary health level through increased sectoral share of allocation.
- 7. Emphasis is laid on rational use of drugs within the allopathic system.

**Table 2.2** Goals of National Health Policy (2002)

8. Increased access to tried and tested systems of traditional medicine is ensured.

Within these broad objectives, NHP-2002 endeavours to achieve the time-bound goals mentioned in the following table:

India's Scientific Policy Resolution (SPR) of 1958 resolved to foster, promote and sustain the cultivation of science and scientific research in all its aspects. Technology was then expected to flow from the country's established science infrastructure. The Technology Policy Statement (TPS) of 1983 emphasised the need to attain technological competence and self-reliance.

The Science and Technology Policy (STP) of 2003 brought science and technology together and emphasised the need for investment in R & D. It called for integrating programmes of socio-economic sectors with the national R & D system to address national problems as well as creating a national innovation system.

India has declared 2010–20 as the "Decade of Innovation". The Government has stressed the need to enunciate a policy to synergise science, technology and innovation and has also established the National Innovation Council. The Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Policy of 2013 is in furtherance of these pronouncements. It aims to bring fresh perspectives to bear on innovation in the Indian context.

The guiding vision of aspiring Indian STI enterprise is to accelerate the pace of discovery and delivery of science-led solutions for faster, sustainable and inclusive growth. A strong and viable Science, Research and Innovation system for High Technology-led path for India (SRISHTI) is the goal of the STI policy.

The key elements of the STI policy are:

- 1. Promoting the spread of scientific temper amongst all sections of society.
- 2. Enhancing skill for applications of science among the young from all social strata.
- 3. Making careers in science, research and innovation attractive enough for talented and bright minds.
- 4. Establishing world class infrastructure for  $R \& D$  for gaining global leadership in some select frontier areas of science.
- 5. Positioning India among the top five global scientific powers by 2020.
- 6. Linking contributions of science, research and innovation system with the inclusive economic growth agenda and combining priorities of excellence and relevance.
- 7. Creating an environment for enhanced Private Sector Participation in R & D.
- 8. Enabling conversion of R & D outputs into societal and commercial applications by replicating hitherto successful models as well as establishing of new PPP structures.
- 9. Seeking S & T-based high-risk innovations through new mechanisms.
- 10. Fostering resource-optimised, cost-effective innovations across size and technology domains.
- 11. Triggering changes in the mindset and value systems to recognise, respect and reward performances which create wealth from S & T-derived knowledge.
- 12. Creating a robust national innovation system.

#### **NATIONAL MINERAL POLICY**

The National Mineral Policy enunciated by the Central Government in 1993 was for liberalisation of the mining sector. With the passage of time and the economic development of the country, which requires a vibrant energy, metal and commodities sector to meet the infrastructure, manufacturing and other sectoral demands, nature and requirements of the mineral sector has changed.

Based on the recommendations of a High Level Committee set up in the Planning Commission, the National Mineral Policy, 1993 was replaced with a new National Mineral Policy, 2008.

The new National Mineral Policy provides for a change in the role of the Central Government and the State governments, particularly in relation to incentivising private sector investment in exploration and mining and ensuring level-playing field and transparency in the grant of concessions and promotion of scientific mining within a sustainable development framework as also to protect the interest of local population in mining areas.

The salient features of the policy are mentioned below:

- 1. It will be ensured that regional and detailed exploration is carried out systematically in the entire geologically conducive mineral bearing area of the country using state-of-the-art techniques in a time bound manner.
- 2. Zero waste mining will be the national goal and mining technology will be upgraded to ensure extraction and utilisation of the entire run-of-mines.
- 3. The regulatory environment will be improved to make it more conducive to investment and technology flows. Capital market structures will be developed to attract risk investment into survey and prospecting.
- 4. Transparency in allocation of concessions will be assured. Preference may be given to a value addition industry in grant of mineral concession. However, this will not in any way undermine the security of tenure to a holder of a concessionaire.
- 5. The development of a proper inventory of resources and reserves, a mining tenement registry and a mineral atlas will be given priority.
- 6. Enforcement of mining plans for adoption of proper mining methods and optimum utilisation of minerals will be ensured.
- 7. A framework of sustainable development will be designed which takes care of bio diversity issues and to ensure that mining activity takes place along with suitable measures for restoration of the ecological balance.
- 8. Special care will be taken to protect the interest of host and indigenous (tribal) populations through developing models of stakeholder interest based on international best practice.
- 9. Employment and tertiary sector spin-offs from both value addition as well as from mining will be encouraged so as to maximise the contribution of the mineral sector to the country's gross domestic product.
- 10. Innovative structures will be devised for developing and financing the infrastructure needs of the mining sector. While assistance through viability gap funding will be extended where required the principle of user charges and Private Public Participation will be the basis on which mining infrastructure will be built.
- 11. The revenues from minerals will be rationalised to ensure that the mineral bearing states get a

fair share of the value of the minerals extracted from their grounds.

12. A comprehensive institutional framework for Research & Development, and Training will be developed.

## **NATIONAL SPORTS POLICY**

The National Sports Policy, 1984 was the first move towards developing an organised and systematic framework for the development and promotion of sports in the country, and the precursor of the present National Sports Policy, 2001.

The twin planks of the National Sports Policy (2001) are "Broad-basing of Sports" and "Achieving Excellence in Sports" at the national and international levels.

- 12. High priority must be accorded to capping, reversing and eventually ending the scourge of doping in Indian athletics and other sports.
- 13. Leveraging sports for national economic development by encouraging sports tourism, including adventure sports in the country.
- 14. There has been under consideration in Parliament since the Twelfth Lok Sabha a Bill aimed at transferring the subject of "sports" from the State List to the Concurrent List in the Seventh Schedule. It is, therefore, proposed to pursue in Parliament the need to shift the emphasis on sports from its present constitutional position.
- 15. A legislation under the residuary powers vested in the Union Government under Entry 97 of the Concurrent List may be considered for providing a legal framework for the Long-Term Development Plans.

# **NATIONAL LITIGATION POLICY**

The Government has formulated the National Litigation Policy 2010, for conduct of litigation on its behalf.

The policy is aimed at reducing pendency of cases and puts checks on government litigation which form the bulk of pending cases.

The provisions / features / objectives of the policy are as follows:
1. The policy is based on the recognition that Government and its various agencies are the predominant litigants in courts and Tribunals in the country. Its aim is to transform Government into an "Efficient and Responsible" litigant. This policy is also based on the recognition that it is the responsibility of the Government to protect the rights of citizens, to respect fundamental rights and those in charge of the conduct of Government litigation should never forget this basic principle.

According to the policy, "Efficient Litigant" means:

- (a) Focusing on the core issues involved in the litigation and addressing them squarely.
- (b) Managing and conducting litigation in a cohesive, coordinated and time-bound manner.
- (c) Ensuring that good cases are won and bad cases are not needlessly persevered with.
- (d) A litigant who is represented by competent and sensitive legal persons: competent in their skills and sensitive to the facts that Government is not an ordinary litigant and that a litigation does not have to be won at any cost.

Similarly, as per the policy, "Responsible Litigant" means:

- (a) That litigation will not be resorted to for the sake of litigating.
- (b) That false pleas and technical points will not be taken and shall be discouraged.
- (c) Ensuring that the correct facts and all relevant documents will be placed before the court.
- (d) That nothing will be suppressed from the court and there will be no attempt to mislead any court or Tribunal.
- 2. Government must cease to be a compulsive litigant. The philosophy that matters should be left to the courts for ultimate decision has to be discarded. The easy approach, "Let the court decide," must be eschewed and condemned.
- 3. The purpose underlying this policy is also to reduce Government litigation in courts so that valuable court time would be spent in resolving other pending cases so as to achieve the goal in the National Legal Mission to reduce average pendency time from fifteen years to three years. Litigators on behalf of Government have to keep in mind the principles incorporated in the National mission for judicial reforms which includes identifying bottlenecks which the Government and its agencies may be concerned with and also removing unnecessary Government cases. Prioritisation in litigation has to be achieved with particular emphasis on welfare legislation, social reform, weaker sections and senior citizens and other categories requiring assistance must be given utmost priority.
- 4. Given that Tribunalisation is meant to remove the loads from Courts, challenge to orders of Tribunals should be an exception and not a matter of routine.
- 5. In Service Matters, no appeal will be filed in cases where:
  - (a) the matter pertains to an individual grievance without any major repercussion;
  - (b) the matter pertains to a case of pension or retirement benefits without involving any principle and without setting any precedent or financial implications.
- 6. Further, proceedings will not be filed in service matters merely because the order of the Administrative Tribunal affects a number of employees. Appeals will not be filed to espouse the cause of one section of employees against another.
- 7. Proceedings will be filed challenging orders of Administrative Tribunals only if:

- (a) there is a clear error of record and the finding has been entered against the Government.
- (b) the judgement of the Tribunal is contrary to a service rule or its interpretation by a High Court or the Supreme Court.
- (c) the judgement would impact the working of the administration in terms of morale of the service, the Government is compelled to file a petition; or
- (d) if the judgement will have recurring implications upon other cadres or if the judgement involves huge financial claims being made.
- 8. Appeals in Revenue matters will not be filed:
  - (a) if the stakes are not high and are less than that amount to be fixed by the Revenue Authorities;
  - (b) if the matter is covered by a series of judgements of the Tribunal or of the High Courts which have held the field and which have not been challenged in the Supreme Court;
  - (c) where the assessee has acted in accordance with long-standing industry practice;
  - (d) merely because of change of opinion on the part of jurisdictional officers.
- 9. All pending cases involving Government will be reviewed. This Due Diligence process shall involve drawing upon statistics of all pending matters which shall be provided for by all Government departments (including PSUs). The Office of the Attorney General and the Solicitor General shall also be responsible for reviewing all pending cases and filtering frivolous and vexatious matters from the meritorious ones.
- 10. Cases will be grouped and categorised. The practice of grouping should be introduced whereby cases should be assigned a particular number of identity according to the subject and statute involved. In fact, further sub-grouping will also be attempted. To facilitate this process, standard forms must be devised which lawyers have to fill up at the time of filing of cases. Panels will be set up to implement categorisation, review such cases to identify cases which can be withdrawn. These include cases which are covered by decisions of courts and cases which are found without merit withdrawn. This must be done in a time bound fashion.

## **NATIONAL DATA SHARING AND ACCESSIBILITY POLICY**

The objective of the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy–2012 (NDSAP-2012) is to facilitate access to Government of India owned shareable data and information in both human readable and machine readable forms through a network all over the country in a proactive and periodically updatable manner, within the framework of various related policies, Acts and Rules of the Government, therefore, permitting a wider accessibility and use of public data and information.

The policy is formulated to promote data sharing and enable access to Government of India owned data for national planning and development. It is designed so as to apply to all sharable non-sensitive data available either in digital or analog forms.

The policy will apply to all data and information created, generated, collected and achieved using public funds provided by Government of India directly or through authorised agencies by various Ministries/ Departments/Organisations/Agencies and Autonomous bodies.

The principles on which data sharing and accessibility need to be based include: Openness, Flexibility, Transparency, Quality, Security and machine-readable.

As per the policy, every department has to identify datasets by the following categories:

- (i) Negative List : The datasets, which are confidential in nature and would compromise to the county's security if made public, are put into this list.
- (ii) Open List: This list comprises of datasets which don't fall under negative list. These datasets shall be prioritised into high value datasets and non-high values datasets.

Different types of datasets generated both in geospatial and non-spatial form by Ministries/Departments shall be classified as shareable data and non-shareable data. The derived statistics like national accounts statistics, indicators like price index, databases from census and surveys are the types of data produced by a statistical mechanism. However, the geospatial data consists primarily of satellite data, maps, etc. In such a mechanism, it becomes important to maintain standards in respect of metadata, data layout and data access policy.

The benefits of the data sharing policy are as follows:

- 1. Maximising use: Ready access to government owned data will enable more extensive use of a valuable public resource for the benefit of the community.
- 2. Avoiding duplication: By sharing data the need or separate bodies to collect the same data will be avoided resulting in significant cost savings in data collection.
- 3. Maximised integration: By adopting common standards for the collection and transfer of data, integration of individual data sets may be feasible.
- 4. Ownership information: The identification of owners for the principal data sets provide information to users to identify those responsible for implementation of prioritised data collection programs and development of data standards.
- 5. Better decision-making: Data and information facilitates making important decisions without incurring repetitive costs. Ready access to existing valuable data is essential for many decision-making tasks such as protecting the environment, development planning, managing assets, improving living conditions, national security and controlling disasters.
- 6. Equity of access: A more open data transfer policy ensures better access to all bonafide users.

## **NATIONAL POLICY ON NARCOTIC DRUGS AND PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES**

The National Policy on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) of 2012 attempts to curb the menace of drug abuse and contains provisions for treatment, rehabilitation and social reintegration of victims of drug abuse. The implementation of the provisions of the policy will lead to reduction of crime, improvement in public health and uplifting of the social milieu.

The policy will serve as a guide to various Ministries and organisations and re-assert India's commitment to combat the drug menace in a holistic manner.

The salient features of the policy are as follows:

- 1. The policy recommends production of Concentrate of Poppy Straw (CPS) in India by a company or body corporate. This would enable India to retain its status of a traditional supplier of Opiate Raw Material (ORM) to the rest of world, while remaining competitive.
- 2. The consumption of poppy straw by addicts will be gradually reduced and finally stopped in a

time frame decided by the States.

- 3. On the illicit cultivation of poppy and cannabis, the policy emphasizes use of satellite imageries for detection of illicit crop and its subsequent eradication and development of alternate means of livelihood in respect of cultivators in pockets of traditional illicit cultivation.
- 4. The private sector may be allowed production of alkaloids from opium. At present alkaloids from opium are produced only in Government Opium and Alkaloid Factories (GOAFs).
- 5. Non-intrusive methods of regulating the manufacture, trade and use of such psychotropic substances will be introduced.
- 6. Emphasis will be laid on adequate access to morphine and other opioids necessary for palliative care, a strategy to address street peddlers of drugs, periodic surveys of drug abuse to gauge the extent, pattern and nature of drug abuse in the country, recognition of de-addiction centers.
- 7. There will be a time bound plan of action, detailing the steps to be taken by different Ministries/ Departments/agencies, in response to the recommendations of the International Narcotics Control Board.

Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances have several medical and scientific uses. However, they can be and are also abused and trafficked. India's approach towards Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances is enshrined in Article 47 of the Constitution of India which mandates that the 'State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption except for medicinal purposes of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to health'. The same principle of preventing use of drugs except for medicinal use was also adopted in the three international conventions on drug related matters, viz., Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971 and the UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988. India has signed and ratified these three conventions. India's commitment to prevention of drug abuse and trafficking predates the coming into force of the three conventions.

The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985 was framed taking into account India's obligations under the three UN drug conventions as well as Article 47 of the Constitution mentioned above. This Act prohibits, except for medical or scientific purposes, the manufacture, production, trade, use, etc. of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.

The Government's policy has thus been to promote their use for medical and scientific purposes while preventing their diversion from licit sources, and prohibiting illicit traffic and abuse. Unlike the earlier Opium Acts and the Dangerous Drugs Act which it replaced, the NDPS Act has given the power of enforcement to various central and state law enforcement agencies, thus spreading the net of law enforcement far and wide.
