# **REGIONAL OFFICER**

### **Meaning**

Many executive departments (directorates) of the state government have their regional offices. The jurisdiction of a regional office extends to a number of districts ranging between three to seven. Thus, a regional office is an intermediate level administrative set-up between the state headquarters (directorates) and its district organisation.

A regional officer (by whatever name he is called) is the head (in-charge) of a regional office. The examples of regional officers are: Deputy Inspector General of Police who heads the range office (a region in case of the police department is called 'range'), Conservator of Forests who heads the range office (also called as circle office), Superintending Engineer of Public Works who heads the circle office, and Regional Transport Officer who heads the regional office. The other examples are: Deputy Director of Agriculture, Joint Director of Animal Husbandry, Regional Joint Director of Education, Superintending Engineer of Irrigation and so on.

A regional officer cannot be compared to a divisional commissioner whose activities are multifunctional. The jurisdiction of a regional officer, on the other hand, is limited to the activities of the concerned department in the region.

Notably, the territorial jurisdiction of regional offices of various executive departments are not coterminus. This is because, each executive department creates its regional offices to suit its own peculiar requirements. Also, the territorial jurisdiction of a regional office may or may not be coterminus with the division of a divisional commissioner.

#### **Functions**

The functions of a regional office include the following:

- 1. To supervise and control the work of the district level officers of the department
- 2. To relieve the head of the department of part of his work. This would enable him to concentrate on more important matters
