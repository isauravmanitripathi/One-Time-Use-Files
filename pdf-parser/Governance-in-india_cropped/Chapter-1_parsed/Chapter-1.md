# **HUMAN RIGHTS**

Human Rights are those rights to which all humans are entitled merely by virtue of being humans. They are the inalienable and inviolable rights of all human beings. They derive from the inherent dignity of human beings. They are essential for human survival and human development.

### **Universal Declaration of Human Rights**

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948. This declaration represents the first international expression of human rights to which all human beings are entitled. It is described as the "International Magna Carta".

The declaration consists of 30 articles which can be divided into four parts. These are explained below.

The first two articles contain the basic principles underlying all human rights. Thus, they state as follows:

| Article 1 : | All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.                          |  |

|             | kind such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national |  |
|             | or social origin, property, birth or other status.                                       |  |

Articles 3 to 21 consist of civil and political rights. They are as under:

| Article 3 : | Right to life, liberty and security             |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Article 4 : | Freedom from slavery and servitude              |
| Article 5 : | Freedom from torture and inhuman punishment     |
| Article 6 : | Right to recognition as a person before the law |
| Article 7 : | Right to equality before the law                |

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |  |

The last three articles specify the context within which all the human rights are to be enjoyed. Thus, they state as under:

| Article 28 : | Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the above rights and |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|              | freedoms can be fully realised.                                                        |
| Article 29 : | The exercise of the above rights and freedoms shall be limited for the purpose of      |
|              | securing recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and for meeting |
|              | the requirements of morality, public order and general welfare.                        |
| Article 30 : | No state, group or person has any right to engage in any activity aimed at the         |
|              | destruction of the above rights and freedoms.                                          |

## **International Bill of Human Rights**

Later on, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was bifurcated into two separate covenants, namely, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The human rights and freedoms contained in the Universal Declaration have been further developed and elaborated upon in these two covenants. Both the covenants were adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1966 and came into force in 1976.

In addition to the above two detailed covenants, two Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights were also adopted by the UN General Assembly. The First Optional Protocol was adopted in 1966 itself while the Second Optional Protocol was adopted in 1989. The First Optional Protocol provides for the submission of complaints by individuals whose human rights have been violated by a State party. The Second Optional Protocol, on the other hand, advocates the abolition of the death penalty.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two Optional Protocols, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights constitute what is now widely regarded as the "International Bill of Human Rights".

## **Other International Conventions**

The International Bill of Human Rights has been further supplemented by various other international treaties, conventions and declarations. They are usually regarded as "human rights instruments". They are specialised in nature and related to either a particular human right or to a specific vulnerable group. The important among them are as follows:

- 1. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (1966)
- 2. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (1979)
- 3. Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1984)
- 4. Declaration on the Right to Development (1986)
- 5. Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989)
- 6. Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families (1990)
- 7. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006)

# **Human Rights in India**

The Constitution of India has a rich content of human rights. The Preamble, the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy reflect the principles and provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948).

The four ideals of the Preamble are aimed at the promotion of human rights. They are as under:

- 1. Justice in social, economic and political spheres
- 2. Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship
- 3. Equality of status and opportunity
- 4. Fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual

The Fundamental Rights under Part-III of the Constitution contain an elaborate list of civil and political rights divided into six categories:

- 1. Right to equality
- 2. Right to freedom
- 3. Right against exploitation
- 4. Right to freedom of religion
- 5. Cultural and educational rights
- 6. Right to constitutional remedies

The Directive Principles of State Policy in Part-IV of the Constitution comprise economic, social and cultural rights. They can be classified into three broad categories, *viz.*,

- 1. Socialistic Principles
- 2. Gandhian Principles

### 3. Liberal-Intellectual Principles

Besides the Fundamental Rights included in Part-III, there are certain other rights contained in other parts of the Constitution—for example, the right to property in Part-XII of the Constitution.

In the course of time, the Supreme Court has also expanded the scope of human rights contained in the Fundamental Rights. It declared a number of human rights as integral part of fundamental rights, though they have not been specifically mentioned in Part-III of the Constitution. The examples of such un-enumerated fundamental rights are right to health, right to speedy trial, right against torture, right to privacy, right to travel abroad, right to free legal aid, and so on.

In addition to these, the various laws enacted by the Parliament and the State Legislatures contain a number of human rights, particularly for the vulnerable sections of the society. Some such laws are the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, the Protection of Civil Rights Act, the Persons with Disabilities Act, the Minimum Wages Act, and so on.

Finally, the Protection of Human Rights Act (1993) defines human rights in India as the rights relating to life, liberty, equality and dignity of the individual guaranteed by the Constitution or embodied in the International Covenants and enforceable by courts in India. Further, it also defined the International Covenants as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 16th December, 1996 and such other Covenant or Convention adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations as the Central Government may, by notifications, specify. The Indian Government acceded to these two International Covenants on April 10, 1979.

The Constitution of India and the laws of Parliament as well as state legislatures not only consist of several human rights but also provide for the establishment of national and state commissions for the protection and promotion of those rights. They are mentioned below in [Tables](#page-3-0) 1.1 and [1.2](#page-3-1).

# **RIGHTS OF WOMEN**

The rights available to woman can be classified into two categories, namely, constitutional rights and legal rights. The constitutional rights are those which are provided in the various provisions of the constitution. The legal rights, on the other hand, are those which are provided in the various laws (acts) of the Parliament and the State Legislatures.

## **Constitutional Rights**

The rights and safeguards enshrined in the constitution for women are as follows:

- 1. The state shall not discriminate against any citizen on the ground of sex (Article 15(1))
- 2. The state is empowered to make any special provision for women. In other words, this provision enables the state to make affirmative discrimination in favour of women (Article 15(3))
- 3. No citizen shall be discriminated against or be ineligible for any employment or office under the state on the ground of sex (Article  $16(2)$ )
- 4. Traffic in human beings and forced labour are prohibited (Article 23(1))
- 5. The state to secure for men and women equally the right to an adequate means of livelihood  $(A<sup>r</sup>$ ticle 39(a))

# **RIGHTS OF MINORITIES**

### **Constitutional Rights**

The Constitution refers to two types of minorities, namely, religious minorities and linguistic minorities. However, the term 'minority' has not been defined anywhere in the Constitution.

In 1993, the Central Government notified five communities, viz., Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Zoroastrians (Parsis) as religious minorities at the national level. In January 2014, the Jain community was added to this list.

A linguistic minority is a group of people whose mother tongue is different from that of the majority in the state or part of a state. This means that linguistic minorities are determined on a state-wise basis.

The Constitution contains special provisions to safeguard the social, educational and economic interests of the minorities. Some of these are common to both religious minorities and linguistic minorities while some others are meant exclusively for linguistic minorities. Hence, these provisions are mentioned here under two headings.

## **Religious and Linguistic Minorities**

- 1. Any section of citizens having a distinct language, script or culture of its own has the right to conserve the same (Article 29(1)).
- 2. No citizen is to be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the state or aided by the state on grounds of religion, race, caste or language (Article 29(2)).
- 3. All minorities, whether based on religion or language, have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice (Article 30(1)).
- 4. The compensation amount fixed by the state for the compulsory acquisition of any property of

a minority educational institution should not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed to the minorities, whether based on religion or language (Article 30(1-A)).

- 5. In granting aid to educational institutions, the state should not discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether based on religion or language (Article 30(2)).
- 6. The wearing and carrying of *kirpans* shall be deemed to be included in the profession of the Sikh religion. In other words, Sikhs have the right to wear and carry *kirpans* (Article 25(2)).

# **Linguistic Minorities**

- 1. When the President (on a demand being made) is satisfied that a substantial proportion of the population of a state desire the use of any language spoken by them to be recognised by that state, then he may direct that such language should also be officially recognised in that state (Article 347).
- 2. Every aggrieved person has the right to submit a representation for the redress of any grievance to any officer or authority of the Union or a state in any of the languages used in the Union or in the state, as the case may be. This means that a representation cannot be rejected on the ground that it is not in the official language (Article 350).
- 3. Every state and a local authority in the state should provide adequate facilities for instruction in the mother tongue at the primary stage of education to children belonging to linguistic minority groups. The President can issue necessary directions for this purpose (Article 350- A).
- 4. The President should appoint a special officer for linguistic minorities to investigate all matters relating to the constitutional safeguards for linguistic minorities and to report to him. The President should place all such reports before the Parliament and send to the state governments concerned (Article 350-B).

# **Legal Rights**

The following legislations contain several rights and safeguards for the minorities:

- 1. National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions Act (2004) provides additional safeguards to the minority educational institutions. It contains provisions for the following:
  - (i) Establishment of a National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions
  - (ii) Right to establish a minority educational institution
  - (iii) Right of a minority educational institution to seek affiliation to any university of its choice
- 2. Waqf Act, 1995 (erstwhile Waqf Act, 1954) was enacted to safeguard the existence of a large number of Waqf properties in the country. The Act provided for the establishment of a Central Waqf Council for the purpose of advising the Government of India on matters pertaining to working of the State Waqf Boards and proper administration of the Waqfs in the country. A Waqf is a permanent dedication of movable or immovable properties for purposes recognised by the Muslim Law as religious, pious or charitable. Apart from these religious aspects, the Waqfs are also instruments of social and economic upliftment.
- 3. The National Commission for Minorities Act (1992) accorded statutory status to the

Minorities Commission set up in 1978. The Commission monitors the working of the safeguards provided to the minorities in the constitution and laws. It also looks into specific complaints regarding deprivation of rights and safeguards of the minorities.

### **Consensual Safeguards**

In addition to the above constitutional safeguards, the linguistic minorities are also provided with some consensual safeguards. These have been arrived at by consensus by the Central and the state governments through series of meetings. They are as follows:

- 1. Instruction through minority languages at the secondary stage of education
- 2. Translation and publication of important rules, regulations, notices, etc., into all languages, which are spoken by at least 15% of the total population at district or sub-district level
- 3. No insistence upon knowledge of State's Official Language at the time of recruitment; test of proficiency in the State's Official Language to be held before completion of probation

The constitutional and the consensual safeguards together with practical ways to implement them has led to the combined scheme of safeguards. The salient features of the scheme, as at present, are:

- 1. Translation and publication of important rules, regulations, notices, etc., into all languages, which are spoken by at least 15% of the total population at district or sub-district level
- 2. Declaration of minority languages as second official language in districts where persons speaking such languages constitute at least 60% of the population
- 3. Receipt of, and reply to, representations in minority languages
- 4. Instruction through mother tongues/minority languages at the primary stage of education
- 5. Instruction through minority languages at the secondary stage of education

- 8. Implementation of three-language formula
- 9. No insistence upon knowledge of State's official language at the time of recruitment; test of proficiency in the State's Official Language to be held before completion of probation
- 10. Issue of pamphlets in minority languages detailing safeguards available to linguistic minorities
- 11. Setting up of proper machinery at the state and district levels

# **RIGHTS OF VICTIMS OF DRUG ABUSE**

## **Constitutional Rights**

The mandate of the Constitution is to ensure equality, freedom, justice and dignity of all individuals including the victims of drug abuse.

Article 47 of Part IV (Directive Principles of State Policy) is particularly relevant with regard to the victims of drug abuse. It provides that the State shall regard the raising of the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people and the improvement of public health as among its primary duties and, in particular, the State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of consumption, except for medicinal purposes, of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to health.

## **Legal Rights**

# **RIGHTS OF CONSUMERS**

## **Consumer Protection Act (1986)**

The Consumer Protection Act was enacted in 1986 with the objective of providing better protection of consumers' interests. The Act provides for effective safeguards to consumers against various types of exploitation and unfair dealings.

The Act lays down the rights of the consumers and also provides for the promotion and protection of the rights of the consumers. It creates an alternative disputes resolution mechanism exclusively for consumers.

The salient features of the Act are as follows:

- 1. The Act enshrines six rights of consumers, namely, right to safety, right to be informed, right to choose, right to be heard, right to seek redressal, and right to consumer education.
- 2. The provisions of the Act are in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force.
- 3. It is an umbrella legislation covering all goods and services, but excluding transactions not involving consumers from the purview of the Act.
- 4. Goods are those which are manufactured or produced and sold to consumers through wholesalers and retailers. Services are in the nature of transport, telephone, electricity, housing, banking, insurance, medical treatment, etc.
- 5. The Act applies to private, public and cooperative sectors.
- 6. A consumer can seek redressal against any manufacturer and trader of goods/service provider, so long as the goods purchased or service availed of was for a consideration.
- 7. The Act provides for simple, inexpensive and timely redressal of consumer complaints.
- 8. The provisions of the Act are not only compensatory in nature but also preventive and punitive in character.
- 9. The Act provides for establishing a three-tier consumer dispute redressal machinery at the national, state and district levels commonly known as National Commission, State Commission and District Forum respectively.
- 10. A written complaint can be filed before the District Consumer Forum for pecuniary value of

upto twenty lakh rupees, State Commission for value upto one crore rupees and the National Commission for value above one crore rupees, in respect of defects in goods and or deficiency in service. The service can be of any description and the illustrations given above are only indicative. However, no complaint can be filed for alleged deficiency in any service that is rendered free of charge or under a contract of personal service.

- 11. If a consumer is not satisfied with the decision of a District Forum, he can appeal to the State Commission. Against the order of the State Commission, a consumer can approach the National Commission.
- 12. The remedy under the Act is an alternative in addition to that already available to the aggrieved persons/consumers by way of civil suit. In the complaint/appeal/petition submitted under the Act, a consumer is not required to pay any court fees; only a nominal fee is required.
- 13. The Act also provides for setting up of Consumer Protection Councils at the Central, State and District levels, which are advisory bodies to promote and protect the rights of the consumers.

### **Rights Under the Act**

The rights of consumers provided under the Act are explained below :

- 1. **Right to Safety:** It is the right to be protected against the marketing of goods and services which are hazardous to life and property.
- 2. **Right to Information:** It is the right of consumers to be informed about the quality, quantity, potency, purity, standard and price of goods or services, with a view to protecting the consumer against unfair trade practices.
- 3. **Right to Choose:** The right to choose can be made meaningful by ensuring access to a variety of goods and services at competitive prices.
- 4. **Right to Represent:** It is right to be heard and to be assured that consumer's interests will receive due consideration at appropriate forums.
- 5. **Right to Redressal:** It is a right to seek redressal against unfair trade practices or restrictive trade practices or unscrupulous exploitation of consumers.
- 6. **Right to Education:** The right to consumer education is a right which ensures that consumers are informed about the practices prevalent in the market and the remedies available to them.

# **RIGHT TO INFORMATION**

### **Rationale**

Right to Information means the freedom of people to have access to government information. It implies that the citizens and non-governmental organisations should enjoy a reasonably free access to all files and documents pertaining to government operations, decisions, and performance. In other words, it means openness and transparency in the functioning of government. Thus, it is antithetical to secrecy in public administration.

In 1992, the World Bank released a document entitled 'Governance and Development'. The document has mentioned seven aspects or elements of governance—one of them being transparency and information.

The Right to Information is necessary due to the following reasons:

- 1. It makes administration more accountable to people.
- 2. It reduces the gap between administration and people.
- 3. It makes people aware of administrative decision-making.
- 4. It facilitates better delivery of goods and services to people by civil servants.
- 5. It facilitates intelligent and constructive criticism of administration.
- 6. It increases people's participation in administration.
- 7. It promotes public interest by discouraging arbitrariness in administrative decision-making.
- 8. It reduces the scope for corruption in public administration.
- 9. It upholds the democratic ideology by promoting openness and transparency in administration.
- 10. It makes administration more responsive to the requirements of people.
- 11. It reduces the chances of abuse of authority by the public servants.

# **Right to Information Act (2005)**

The Constitution of India has no direct provision expressly conferring right to information to the citizens. However, the Supreme Court has been stating since 1975 that the right to information is an intrinsic part of the following two fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India:

- (i) Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression (Article 19).
- (ii) Right to Life and Personal Liberty (Article 21).

In India, various laws and rules restrict the disclosure of official information to the people and thus favour secrecy in administration. These are:

- (i) Official Secrets Act, 1923
- (ii) Indian Evidence Act, 1872
- (iii) Commission of Enquiry Act, 1952
- (iv) All-India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1954
- (v) Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1955
- (vi) Railway Services (Conduct) Rules, 1956

Recognising the need for setting out a practical regime for securing of information by citizens from the public authorities, and to promote transparency and accountability in the working of all public authorities, the Parliament enacted the Right to Information Act in 2005.

The law is comprehensive and covers disclosure of information on almost all matters of governance. It is applicable to Government at all levels—Central, State and Local (both rural and urban) and also to the bodies owned, controlled or substantially financed by the government, as well as to the non-governmental organisations receiving government grants. It covers the legislature, the judiciary, the executive and all constitutional bodies.

The salient features (or provisions) of the Act are mentioned below:

1. The Act confers on all citizens the right of access to the information and, correspondingly, makes the dissemination of such information an obligation on all public authorities.

- 2. It provides for the appointment of a public information officer in each department to provide information to the public on request.
- 3. It fixes a 30-day deadline for providing information; deadline is 48 hours if information concerns life or liberty of a person.
- 4. Information will be free for people below poverty line. For others, fee will be reasonable.
- 5. The Act imposes obligation on public agencies to disclose the information suo-motu to reduce requests for an information.
- 6. Government bodies have to publish details of staff payments and budgets.
- 7. Certain types of information are exempted from disclosure. These relate to sovereignty and integrity of India, security, scientific or economic interest of the country, cabinet deliberations and so on.
- 8. A public information officer may reject a request for information if it involves an infringement of copyright subsisting in a person other than the state.
- 9. Restrictions are made for third party information. The submission of third party is to be considered while taking a decision about disclosure of information.
- 10. It provides for the establishment of a Central Information Commission and State Information Commissions to implement the provisions of the Act. They will be high-powered independent bodies to act as appellate authorities and vested with the powers of a civil court.
- 11. The Central Information Commission entertains complaints and appeals in case of offices, financial institutions, public sector undertakings, etc., under the Central Government and the Union Territories while the State Information Commission entertains complaints and appeals pertaining to offices, financial institutions, public sector undertakings, etc., under the control of the concerned State Government.
- 12. The President will appoint a Chief Information Commissioner and Governors of states will appoint state information commissioners. Their term will be of five years.
- 13. The Chief Information Commissioner and State Information Commissioner will publish an annual report on the implementation of the Act. These reports will be tabled before Parliament and state legislature.
- 14. The Act overrides the Official Secrets Act, 1923. The information commissions can allow access to the information if public interest outweights harm to protected persons.
- 15. It carries strict penalties for failing to provide information or affecting its flow. The erring officials will be subjected to departmental proceedings.
- 16. The information commission shall fine an official Rs. 250 per day (subject to a maximum of Rs. 25,000) if information is delayed without reasonable cause beyond the stipulated 30 days.
- 17. The Act provides for a system of two appeals in case the information is denied: first appeal to the senior of the concerned public information officer within 30 days and second appeal to the Information Commission within 90 days. The decision of the Information Commission is binding.
- 18. The appeals at both stages must be disposed of within 30 days which is extendable by 15 days if necessary. But, in any case the decision must be given within 45 days.
- 19. There is a bar on jurisdiction of courts. Hence, no court can entertain any suit, application or other proceeding in respect of any order made under the Act.

- 20. Its purview does not extend to intelligence and security organisations like Intelligence Bureau, RAW, BSF, CISF, NSG and so on. However, information pertaining to allegations of corruption or violation of human rights by these organisations will not be excluded.
- 21. The Act repealed the old Freedom of Information Act (2002) which was unnotified and hence, not operational.

#### **State Information Acts**

Even before the Central legislation was passed, some of the states had introduced their own right to information legislation. The first amongst these was Tamil Nadu. The states and the respective years of the enactment of legislations are mentioned below in [Table](#page-22-0) 1.3.

<span id="page-22-0"></span>

<span id="page-22-1"></span>[\\*](#page-22-2) Maharashtra repealed its earlier Right to Information Act of 2000 to bring out an improved one in 2002.

In Rajasthan, the Right to Information movement was initiated by Aruna Roy in the early 1990s. The Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) succeeded through struggle and agitation, in accessing and using information to put an end to local corruption and exploitation.

## <span id="page-22-2"></span>**RIGHT TO EDUCATION**

#### **Constitutional Provisions**

Article 21-A declares that the State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such a manner as the State may determine. Thus, this provision makes only elementary education a Fundamental Right and not higher or professional education.

This provision was added by the 86th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2002. This amendment is a major milestone in the country's aim to achieve 'education for all'. The government described this step as 'the dawn of the second revolution in the chapter of rights of citizens'.

Even before this amendment, the Constitution contained a provision for free and compulsory education for children under Article 45 in Part IV. However, being a directive principle, it was not

enforceable by the courts. Now, there is scope for judicial intervention in this regard.

This amendment changed the subject matter of Article 45 in directive principles. It now reads —'The state shall endeavour to provide early childhood care and education for all children until they complete the age of six years.' It also added a new fundamental duty under Article 51-A that reads —'It shall be the duty of every citizen of India who is a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his child or ward between the age of six and fourteen years'.

In 1993 itself, the Supreme Court recognised a Fundamental Right to primary education in the right to life under Article 21. It held that every child or citizen of this country has a right to free education until he completes the age of 14 years. Thereafter, his right to education is subject to the limits of economic capacity and development of the state. In this judgement, the Court overruled its earlier judgement (1992) which declared that there was a fundamental right to education up to any level including professional education like medicine and engineering.

## **Right to Education Act (2009)**

The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 was enacted to implement the constitutional provision under Article 21-A. The Act provides for free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years. The Central Government affixed 1st April, 2010 as the date of enforcement of the Act.

The Act provides children in the 6-14 age group the legal entitlement to free and compulsory education. It provides the legislative framework for Universalisation of Elementary Education.

The salient features (or provisions) of the Act are mentioned below:

- 1. It provides for the right of children to free and compulsory education till completion of elementary education in a neighbourhood school
- 2. It clarifies that 'compulsory education' means obligation of the appropriate government to provide free elementary education and ensure compulsory admission, attendance and completion of elementary education to every child in the six to fourteen age group. 'Free' means that no child shall be liable to pay any kind of fee or charges or expenses which may prevent him or her from pursuing and completing elementary education.
- 3. It makes provisions for a non-admitted child to be admitted to an age appropriate class.
- 4. It specifies the duties and responsibilities of appropriate governments, local authorities, parents, schools and teachers in providing free and compulsory education.
- 5. It specifies the sharing of financial and other responsibilities between the Central and State Governments.
- 6. It lays down the norms and standards relating *inter alia* to Pupil Teacher Ratios (PTRs), buildings and infrastructure, school working days, teacher working hours.
- 7. It provides for rational deployment of teachers by ensuring that the specified pupil teacher ratio is maintained for each school, rather than just as an average for the State or District or Block, thus ensuring that there is no urban–rural imbalance in teacher postings.
- 8. It provides for prohibition of deployment of teachers for non-educational work, other than decennial census, elections to local authority, state legislatures and Parliament, and disaster relief.
- 9. It provides for appointment of appropriately trained teachers, i.e., teachers with the requisite

entry and academic qualifications.

- 10. It prohibits (i) physical punishment and mental harassment, (ii) screening procedures for admission of children, (iii) capitation fees, (iv) private tuition by teachers, and (v) running of schools without recognition.
- 11. It provides for the following penalties:
  - (i) For charging capitation fee: Fine upto 10 times the capitation fee charged
  - (ii) For resorting to screening during admission: Rs. 25,000 for first contravention; Rs. 50,000 for each subsequent contravention
  - (iii) For running a school without recognition: Fine upto one lakh rupees, and in case of continuing contravention Rs.10,000 for each day during which the contravention continues
- 12. It provides for the establishment of a School Management Committee in all schools other than unaided ones. It should consist of the elected representatives of the local authority, parents or guardians of children admitted in the school and teachers. It shall perform the following functions:
  - (i) monitor the working of the school
  - (ii) prepare and recommend school development plan
  - (iii) monitor the utilisation of the grants received from the government or local authority or any other source; and
  - (iv) any other prescribed function
- 13. It provides for development of a curriculum in consonance with the values enshrined in the Constitution, and which would ensure the all-round development of the child, building on the child's knowledge, potentiality and talent, and making the child free of fear, trauma and anxiety through a system of child friendly and child centred learning.
- 14. It provides for protection and monitoring of the child's right to free and compulsory education and redressal of grievances by the National and State Commissions for Protection of Child Rights, which shall have the powers of a civil court.
- 15. It provides for the establishment of a National Advisory Council and a State Advisory Council in each state to advise the respective governments on implementation of the provisions of the Act in an effective manner.
