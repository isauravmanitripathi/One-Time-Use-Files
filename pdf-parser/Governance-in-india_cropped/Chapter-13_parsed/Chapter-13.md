#### **INCOME-TAX APPELLATE TRIBUNAL**

The *Income Tax Act*, 1961 provides that the Central Government shall constitute an Appellate Tribunal consisting of as many Judicial Members and Accountant Members as it thinks fit, to exercise the powers and discharge the functions conferred on the Appellate Tribunal by the said Act. The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) was established in 1941, in pursuance of a similar provision contained in the *Indian Income Tax Act*, 1922.

The present sanctioned strength of Members of Tribunal is 126 for 63 benches spread over 27 cities throughout the country.

The Tribunal is presently headed by the President assisted by one Senior Vice-President and nine Vice-Presidents.

Primarily, the Tribunal was set up to dispose of appeals arising from assessments under the Income Tax Act. When other direct taxes, *viz*., Excess Profits Tax, Business Profits Tax, Wealth Tax Act, Gift Tax Act, Expenditure Tax Act, Super Profits Tax Act were introduced from time to time, orders of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner under all these Acts were made appealable to the Tribunal. Orders passed by the Appellate Controller of Estate Duty are also appealable to the Tribunal. Orders prejudicial to assesses passed by the Commissioner in exercise of his Revisional Jurisdiction also come up in appeal to the Tribunal. The Tribunal is thus functioning at present as the appellate Tribunal for all direct taxes including Estate Duty.

## **INCOME TAX SETTLEMENT COMMISSION**

The Income Tax Settlement Commission (ITSC) is an important Alternate Disputes Resolution (ADR) mechanism for resolving tax disputes relating to Direct Taxes. At present, four benches of the Commission are operational at New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai, respectively.

The Commission was constituted in 1976, on the recommendation of the Wanchoo Committee (1971). The Committee conceived the Commission as a mechanism for providing room for settlement and compromise for one-time tax evaders or unintending defaulters. One 'Case' settled by the Commission, reduces litigation in respect of an applicant for several years relating to proceedings of various nature, such as assessment, penalty, prosecution, tax collection, etc. Each such proceeding before an Assessing Officer of the Income Tax Department is appealable before the Commissioner (Appeals) and later before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and where it involves question of law, even up to High Courts and the Supreme Court.

Later in 1996, a review of the mechanism of the Commission was done by a committee led by Justice Duggal, which found that the Commission has been substantially successful in achieving the objects for which it was set up. It also acknowledged that in the revenue matters, the Commission has contributed in moving from conflict to consensus approach.

In 2009, the Supreme Court observed the advantages of the Commission in settling liabilities across the board in complicated cases having doubtful benefits to revenue.

Each Bench comprises of one Presiding Officer (Chairman/ Vice-chairman) and two members, who are retired IRS officers. Each bench of the Commission is supported by two senior IRS officers of the level of Joint Secretary, i.e., a Secretary and a Director (Investigation). The Secretary provides administrative support, while the Director (Investigation) and the Additional Directors (Investigation) provide technical support to the Commission in deciding the settlement applications.

The Tribunal has, for the purposes of discharging its functions under the I.T. Act, the same powers as are vested in a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.

The Board has its headquarters at Chennai and shall have sittings at Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Ahmedabad.

The *Trade Marks Act*, 1999 provides for the establishment of the Board. The objective of setting up of the Board is to hear and decide appeals from the order or decision of the Registrar of Trade Marks which till now were under the jurisdiction of the High Courts.

### **RAILWAY CLAIMS TRIBUNAL**

In the year 1890, an enactment known as the *Indian Railway Act* was legislated and passed by British

Parliament. This piece of legislation was aimed at various matters concerning railways. After independence, it was felt that some changes be brought in the Act to fulfill needs of people in the present day. So maintaining some provisions of Act of 1890, rendering some provisions redundant and replacing new provisions, a new legislation named the *Railways Act*, 1989 was enacted.

The broad features of this Act are that Railways were re-constituted in zones with a General Manager for each zone. The Central Government had power to fix the rates of carriage of passengers and goods. The provision for compensation by Railways on account of loss, damage of goods etc. and also due to accidental deaths and injury was maintained. The special provisions were introduced regarding monetary liability of railways as carriers of goods etc.

The *Railway Claims Tribunal Act*, 1987 was enacted to provide speedy disposal of claims against the Railway Administration. Although Railway Administration made a way to compensate the consignor/consignee of goods etc. and also for compensation for loss of lives yet people were not often satisfied and they went to Courts, which took very long time to decide the claims and litigation was protracted for indefinite period. Therefore, the necessity was felt to expedite the disposal of claims at the earliest, which resulted in establishment of the Claims Tribunal, which would exclusively deal with such claims and speedily dispose of the same. As a result, the burden of Courts was reduced and speedy relief was made available. Even the refund of fares and freights was also brought within the purview of Tribunal.

The RCT Act is to provide for the establishment of a Railway Claims Tribunal for inquiring into and determining claims against a Railway Administration for loss, destruction, damage, deterioration or non-delivery of animals or goods entrusted to it to be carried by railway or for the refund of fares or freight or for compensation for death or injury to passengers occurring as a result of railway accidents or untoward incidents.

The scheme of the Act shows that it made provisions for establishment of Tribunal, its Benches, officers and staff, their term, eligibility, the jurisdiction, powers and authority of Tribunal, its procedure, execution of its orders and appeals. In this way, the Act is a self-contained Act.

#### **PRESS COUNCIL OF INDIA**
