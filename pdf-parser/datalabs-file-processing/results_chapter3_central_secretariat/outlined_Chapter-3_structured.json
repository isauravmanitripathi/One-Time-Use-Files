    "text": "The Central Secretariat comprises of all the ministers and departments of the Central Government. In other words, Central Government, for the purpose of administration, is divided into various ministries and departments. The Central Secretariat is a totality of such ministries and departments. A ministry generally consists of two to four departments. However, there can be a ministry without being divided into departments, like Ministry of External Affairs. Similarly, there can be a department without being placed under a ministry, like Department of Atomic Energy. The ministries and departments are headed politically by ministers and administratively by Secretaries.\n\nArticle 77 of the Constitution of India authorises the President of India to make rules for more convenient transaction of business of Central Government and for allocation of such business among the ministers. This is the basis of portfolio system, the essence of which is that a minister is made incharge of ministry/department and he is to issue orders on behalf of the President. Therefore, the concept of a ministry/department originate from portfolio system. The ministries/departments enumerated in the Allocation of Business Rules are collectively known as the Central Secretariat. At present, the ministries/departments of Central Government are governed by the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961.",

The following points can be noted in this regard:\n\n• (i) In 1843, the Governor-General of India separated the Secretariat of the Government of India from that of the government of Bengal. Accordingly, four departments, namely, home, finance, military and foreign were set up in the Central Secretariat.\n\n• (ii) In 1859, the portfolio system was introduced by Lord Canning. Consequently, a member of the Governor-General's Council was made incharge of one or more departments of the Central Secretariat and was authorised to issue orders on behalf of the Council.\n\n• (iii) In 1905, the tenure system of secretariat staffing was introduced by Lord Curzon.\n\n• (iv) In 1905, the Railway Board was set up by a resolution of the Government of India. Consequently, the control of railways was transferred to it from the Public Works Department.\n\n(v) In 1947, the departments of the Government of India were renamed 'ministries'. In all, there were 18 such ministries in the Central Secretariat at that time.",

    "text": "The Secretariat system in India is based on the principle of separation of policy-making function from that of policy execution. Under this scheme of separation, that is, the split system, the Secretariat should be concerned only with policy-making and hence, should not indulge itself in process of policy execution. The task of policy-execution should be left to executive agencies which are located outside the Secretariat organisation.\n\nThe advantages of the split system are:\n\n(i) It helps Secretariat officials (i.e. policy makers) plan keeping in view aggregate national\n\ninterests, goals and requirements. This is because they are freed from the responsibilities of day-to-day administration.\n\n• (ii) It enables the Secretary to examine objectively proposals emanating from executive agencies keeping in view broader point of view of the government as a whole. This is because, the Secretary is secretary to the government as a whole, not to his minister alone.\n\n• (iii) It provides operational freedom to executive agencies in the execution of policies. This is because Secretariat, under the split system, is not supposed to interfere in the task of policyimplementation and has to be solely concerned with policy making. Hence, it encourages specialisation and delegation of authority and avoids over-centralisation.\n\n• (iv) It results in keeping the Secretariat smaller and manageable in size due to division of work between two separate agencies.\n\n• (v) Programme implementation in the field can be evaluated objectively by Secretariat officials. This responsibility cannot be assigned to executive agencies which implement programmes.\n\nIn this respect, the Indian Secretariat model differs from the British Whitehall model. In Britain, a ministry is responsible for both, policy-making as well as policy execution. In the words of Avasthi and Avasthi, \"The Secretariat in India may be said to be sui generis. While it may have adopted Whitehall in Britain as its model, it never became a real counterpart of the British Secretariat. While in India there obtain two sets of parallel hierarchies, one in the Secretariat and the other under the heads of executive departments, no such distinction is found in Britain where a ministry is an integrated agency including within itself both policy formulating and executing agencies.\" On the other hand, Indian Secretariat System is similar to the Swedish system. In the words of S.R.Maheshwari, \"In this respect India and Sweden might be held to be comparable: Sweden has two separate and quite distinct sets of organisations, one for policy-making and another charged with the responsibility for implementation of the policies\".",

In official parlance, this arrangement is known as the tenure system.\" Thus, under tenure system of staffing, every official so deputed has to work in the Central Secretariat for a fixed period, which differs from one grade to another in the Secretariat hierarchy as mentioned below.\n\n\n[TABLE]\n(i)\nSecretary\nand\nJoint-Secretary5\nyears(ii)\nDeputy\nSecretary4\nyears(iii)\nUnder\nSecretary3\nyears\n[/TABLE]\n\n\nThe tenure system was introduced in India in 1905 by Lord Curzon, the then Governor-Gerneral of India. He believed that \"India may be governed from Simla or Calcutta; but is administered from the plains.\" The tenure system originated from such a belief of Lord Curzon who came to be regarded as the \"father of tenure system.\"\n\nThe following committees and commissions appointed during the British rule supported the tenure system.\n\n• (i) Llewellyn Smith Committee (1919)–Report of the Government of India Secretariat Procedure Committee.\n\n• (ii) Simon Commission (1930)–Report of the Indian Statutory Commission.\n\n• (iii) Wheeler Committee (1936)–Report of the Government of India Secretariat Committee\n\n• (iv) Maxwell Committee (1937)–Report on organisation and procedure.\n\n• (v) Rowlands Committee (1944—45)–Report of the Bengal Administration Enquiry Committee.\n\nThe ARC Study Team on personnel administration (1967) also supported the tenure system of staffing in Central Secretariat (as well as in state secretariats).\n\nThe following arguments are put forward in favour of the tenure system.\n\n• (i) It facilitates administrative coordination between the Centre and states. Thus, it strengthens the functioning of Indian federal polity.\n\n• (ii) It facilitates appointment in the Central Secretariat of officers who have first hand experience in field administration (or district administration).\n\n• (iii) It provides state governments officers having national perspective and rich experience.\n\n• (iv) It provides equal opportunities to all the officers who are entitled to a spell of stay at the Secretariat.\n\n• (v) It secures administrative unity of the nation as well as independence of civil service.\n\n• (vi) It facilitates the formulation of realistic national policies, which will have less difficulties in the implementation in the field. This is because, it keeps the secretariat officials in touch with the actual facts of administration.\n\n• (vii) It removes the possibility of officers becoming stale due to their long stay at the secretariat. It provides them with an opportunity of working in a different atmosphere which can bring freshness to their outlook.\n\n• (viii) It enables all the officers to enjoy the special benefits of secretariat posting and thereby improves the morale in the civil service.\n\n• (ix) It provides the required flexibility in the personnel management of the secretariat by enabling it to get rid of inefficient and incompetent officials in an easy manner.\n\nHowever, the critics have put forth the following arguments against the tenure system:\n\n• (i) It results in 'office-dominated administration' and 'over-bureaucratisation' of the secretariat. A new officer posted at the secretariat depends too much on permanent office establishment to get things done.\n\n• (ii) It does not ensure specialisation as it is essentially based on the myth of the higher caliber of the generalist administrator. On the other hand, the work in the ministries and departments is fastly becoming specialized.\n\n• (iii) Its main thrust—district or field experience—is not necessary and relevant in many areas of secretariat work.\n\nNotably, the tenure system was never prevalent in all the ministries and departments of the Central government. Even during the British era, the following four departments were excluded from the purview of the tenure system: (a) Indian Audit and Accounts Department; (b) Customs and Income-Tax Department; (c) Foreign and Political Department; and (d) Posts and Telegraphs Department.\n\nToday, the tenure system is not as strong as it used to be before Independence. The following factors have contributed to the weakening and breaking down of the tenure system.\n\n• (i) A large number of posts of Under and Deputy Secretaries are today manned by members of the Central Secretariat Service. Thus, the creation of this service in 1948 gave rise to a separate cadre of permanent Secretariat officers. At present, the Central Secretariat Service comprises of the following five grades: (a) Senior Selection Grade (Director); (b) Selection Grade (Deputy Secretary); (c) Grade-I (Under Secretary); (d) Section Officer's Grade; and (e) Assistant's Grade. The Department of Personnel and Training of the Ministry of Personnel is the cadre controlling authority in respect of this service.\n\n• (ii) The specialist members of the Indian Economic Service and the Indian Statistical Service (Created in 1961 as the specialist Central services–Class I) who are posted in large numbers in the Central Secretariat are not subject to tenure system, that is, rotation between the field and headquarter (Secretariat).\n\n• (iii) The creation of the Finance-Commerce pool in 1938 (discontinued in 1946) and the Central administrative pool in 1957 have modified the tenure system. The latter consists of officers drawn from (a) the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), (b) Central Services-Class I, (c) Central Secretariat Service–Class I and (d) State Services–Class I. It was established as a reserve for manning posts of and above the grade of Deputy Secretary in Central Secretariat.\n\nIt has both, general purpose and specialised categories of posts in it. The pool is managed and controlled by the Ministry of Personnel.\n\n• (iv) The officers who come to Central Secretariat on deputation under tenure system do not go back to their parent departments or state governments due to the advantages of Secretariat postings like high salary, capital city amenities, nearness to power centre and so on.\n\n• (v) The states are not always enthusiastic about sharing their best officers with Central Government. Such reluctance on the part of state governments has affected the even flow of officers between the Secretariat and the field.\n\n• (vi) The tenure system came into existence when India was a unitary state. But after the Independence, unitary system was replaced by a federal system. As rightly observed by Avasthi and Avasthi, \"The tenure system does not fit quite well in a federal polity with autonomous states. Amateur ministers at both, the Central and the state levels need services of permanent advisors in the Secretariat; mere 'birds of passage' will not do.\"",

Post-independence institutional developments (permanent Central Secretariat Service, specialist central services, administrative pools) and behavioural incentives (preference to remain in Delhi, state reluctance to share officers) have attenuated the system, producing a mixed staffing model that raises contemporary tensions between rotation-driven generalism and permanence-driven specialization. The policy implications point to a need for deliberate cadre management to reconcile federal coordination, technical competence, and institutional continuity."

    "text": "The present grading of Secretariat officials is as follows.\n\n• Secretary\n\n• Additional Secretary\n\n• Joint Secretary\n\n• Director\n\n• Deputy Secretary\n\n• Under Secretary\n\nThe first three grades constitute the 'top management,' while the last three grades constitute the \"middle management\". All these officials function on the principle of 'filter,' that is, each officer disposes of work at his level and submits important cases to the higher level. Moreover, all these grades of officials perform their duties keeping in view the interest of the Government of India as a whole. That is why a Secretary is designated as the Secretary to the Government of India, and not to his minister/ministry alone.\n\nSecretary A Secretary has following roles.\n\n• (i) He is administrative head of the Ministry/Department. His responsibility in this regard is complete and undivided.\n\n• (ii) He is chief advisor to the minister on all aspects of policy and administrative affairs.\n\n• (iii) He represents his ministry/department before the Public Accounts Committee of the Parliament.\n\nAdditional/Joint Secretary An Additional Secretary is in charge of either a department or a wing of a department. A Joint Secretary, on the other hand, is always in charge of a wing of a department. The rank and pay of a Joint Secretary is lower than that of an Additional Secretary who is senior to the former. However there is not much distinction in their functions except when an Additional Secretary is in charge of a department. Richard Tottenham Report on the Reorganisation of Central Government (1945) stated that, \"Additional and Joint Secretaries should not be either cheap\n\nSecretaries or expensive Deputy Secretaries.\"\n\nDirector/Deputy Secretary The post of Director was created in 1960. As observed by S.R. Maheshwari, \"There is not much Difference between the responsibilities of a Director and a Deputy secretary, nor is a Deputy Secretary placed under a director.\" But the rank and pay of a Director is higher than that of a Deputy Secretary.\n\nA Deputy Secretary acts on behalf of the Secretary and is in charge of a division. He himself usually disposes of maximum cases and seeks instructions from Joint/Additional Secretaries or Secretary of the department only on important cases.\n\nUnder Secretary He is in charge of a branch and hence, is also called a 'Branch Officer.' He usually initiates action on all inward communications. He disposes minor cases on his own and submits only important cases to the Deputy Secretary.\n\nBefore Independence, there was another grade called Assistant Secretary below an Under Secretary. This post was abolished on the recommendation of the Maxwell Committee Report of 1937.\n\nOfficer on Special Duty (OSD) An Officer on Special Duty is usually appointed from among the existing officials to handle work which is urgent and which needs full concentration. It is basically a temporary post, created to meet a specific exigency, and the duties and functions performed by an OSD are of a special nature. However, the status of an OSD is not fixed and it may vary from that of a Secretary to an Under Secretary. In some cases, a section officer is also appointed as an OSD.\n\nThe post of OSD in India is a British legacy. It has the following merits:\n\n• (i) It permits better co-ordination of the work.\n\n• (ii) It facilitates expeditious execution of the decision and completion of the work.\n\nThe bodies (agencies) which make the selection of the officers of different grades in the Central Secretariat are mentioned below in Table 3.1.\n\n\n[TABLE]\nTable\n3.1\nSelection\nof\nSecretariat\nOfficialsPostsSelection\nMade\nBy(i)Secretary/Additional\nSecretaryCabinet\nSecretary(ii)Joint\nSecretarySenior\nSelection\nBoard\n(Presided\nover\nby\nthe\nCabinet\nSecretary).(iii)Director/Deputy\nSecretary/Under\nSecretaryCentral\nEstablishment\nBoard\n(presided\nover\nby\nthe\nSecretary\nof\nthe\nMinistry\nof\nPersonnel).\n[/TABLE]\n\n\nThe final decision in all the three cases is taken by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet which is headed by the Prime Minister.",

His major job is to supervise the work of staff in his section. He is the first line supervisor in the hierarchy of Secretariat personnel.\n\nThe staff of the office component of Secretariat is drawn from the following two services.\n\n• 1. The Central Secretariat Stenographers Service, which consists of the five grades, namely (i) Senior Principal Private Secretary Grade, (ii) Private Secretary Grade (Principal Private Secretary), (iii) Grade A and B (Merged) (Private Secretary), (iv) Grade C (Personal Assistant) and Grade D (Stenographer).\n\n• 2. The Central Secretariat Clerical Service, which consists of the two grades, namely (i) Upper Division Grade (UDC), and (ii) Lower Division Grade (LDC).\n\nThe Department of Personnel and Training of the Ministry of Personnel is the cadre controlling authority in respect of these two services.\n\nSince 1976, the Staff Selection Commission has been organising competitive examinations to directly recruit lower division clerks. The posts of Upper Division Clerks are filled by indirect recruitment, that is, by promoting Lower Division Clerks. The posts of Assistant Section Officers and Section Officers are filled partly by direct recruitment through a competitive examination and partly through promotion of respective subordinate personnel.",

The manual of office procedure defines these offices as follows: \"Where the execution of the policies of Government requires decentralisation of executive direction and the establishment of field agencies, a ministry has under it subsidiary offices. The Attached Offices are responsible for providing executive direction required in the implementation of policies laid down by the ministry to which they are attached. They also serve as repository of technical information and advice to the ministry on technical aspects of questions dealt with by them. The subordinate offices function as field establishments or as agencies responsible for the detailed execution of decisions of government. They generally function under the direction of an Attached Office, or in cases where the volume of the execution direction involved is not considerable, directly under a ministry.\"\n\nHowever, the Tottenham Committee (1945–46) and the First Pay Commission (Vardhachariar– 1946–47) found the distinction between the Attached Office and the Subordinate Office as unsatisfactory and artificial and hence suggested the abolition of distinction between the two categories of offices.",

To smoothen the relationship between these two entities, six principal types of arrangements have been made. These are explained below:\n\n1. Complete Separation Pattern Under this pattern, there is a complete separation between the secretariat and its executive agencies. Both have distinct and separate offices and files of their own. This is the most prevalent pattern and is based on the policy-administration separation (split system), staff-line dichotomy and generalist-specialist dichotomy.\n\n2. Complete Merger Pattern Under this pattern, there is a cent-percent merger between the secretariat and its executive agencies. This total integration model is used only in special cases.\n\n3. Link Officer Pattern Under this pattern, a Senior Secretariat Officer is concurrently appointed as head of the executive agency. Thus, the link officer will have a dual role, that is, policy formulation as well as policy implementation.\n\n4. Ex-Officio Secretariat Status Pattern Under this pattern, the head of the executive agency is accorded with an appropriate ex-officio secretariat status. He is given authority to take decisions on certain matters independently. He will have closer involvement in policy-formulation.\n\n5. Common Office Pattern Under this pattern, the secretariat and the executive agency have a common office, common files, and a common file bureau. This common office serves both, the officers of the secretariat as well as those of the executive agency. The Estimates Committee and the Second Pay Commission recommended this pattern.\n\n6. Common File Pattern Under this system, the Secretariat and the executive agency have separate offices but common files and a single file bureau. The Rowlands Committee (Bengal Administration Enquiry Committee) of 1944–45 recommended this pattern.",

Proliferation is a post‑Independence phenomenon shaped by developmental state responsibilities and political changes.",
        "broader_significance": "Growth in the number of ministries reshapes the architecture of central administration: it alters workload distribution across Secretariats and executive agencies, increases demand for specialist staff and new cadres, pressures the tenure and deputation arrangements, complicates subject allocation, and raises coordination costs—thus affecting policy coherence and implementation capacity.",
        "practical_implications": "Administratively, proliferation mandates stronger horizontal coordination (Cabinet Secretariat, inter‑ministerial committees), possible rationalisation or periodic restructuring (mergers/splits), refinement of Allocation of Business schedules, strengthened capacity for technical advice in Secretariats, and attention to staffing/cadre planning to avoid duplication and capability gaps."

    "text": "The Cabinet Secretariat is under the direct charge of the Prime Minister. The administrative head of the Secretariat is the Cabinet Secretary who is also the ex-officio Chairman of the Civil Services Board.\n\nIn the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961 \"Cabinet Secretariat\" finds a place in the First Schedule to the Rules. The subjects allotted to this Secretariat are:\n\n• (i) Secretarial assistance to Cabinet and Cabinet Committees\n\n• (ii) Rules of Business\n\nThe Cabinet Secretariat is responsible for the administration of the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961 and the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules 1961, facilitating smooth transaction of business in Ministries/Departments of the Government by ensuring adherence to these rules. The Secretariat assists in decision-making in Government by ensuring inter-ministerial coordination, ironing out differences amongst Ministries/Departments and evolving consensus through the instrumentality of the standing/adhoc Committees of Secretaries. Through this mechanism new policy initiatives are also promoted.\n\nThe Cabinet Secretariat ensures that the President, the Vice President and Ministers are kept informed of the major activities of all Ministries/Departments by means of monthly summary of their activities. Management of major crises situations in the country and coordinating activities of various ministries in such a situation is also one of the functions of the Cabinet Secretariat.\n\nThe secretarial assistance provided by Cabinet Secretariat to the Cabinet and Cabinet Committees includes:\n\n• (i) Convening of the meetings of the Cabinet on the orders of the Prime Minister.\n\n• (ii) Preparation and circulation of the agenda.\n\n• (iii) Circulating papers related to the cases on the agenda.\n\n• (iv) Preparing a record of discussions taken.\n\n• (v) Circulation of the record after obtaining the approval of the Prime Minister.\n\n• (vi) Watching implementation of the decisions taken by the Cabinet.\n\nThe Cabinet Secretariat is the custodian of the papers of the Cabinet meetings. Among the inter-ministerial matters, coordination is required for:\n\n• (i) removing difficulties;\n\n• (ii) removing differences;\n\n• (iii) overcoming delays;\n\n• (iv) coordination in administrative action; and\n\n• (v) coordination of policies.\n\nWhile each Ministry is responsible for acting on its own for expeditious implementation of Government policies, plans and programmes, where inter-ministerial cooperation is involved, they often seek the assistance of the Cabinet Secretariat. The inter-ministerial problems are dealt with in the meetings of the Committees of Secretaries (COS). The Committees are constituted for discussing specific matters and proposals emanating from various Secretaries to the Government and meetings are held under the chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary. These committees have been able to break bottlenecks or secure mutually supporting inter-ministerial action.\n\nThe discussions of the COS takes place on the basis of a paper formulated by the principal department concerned and the department with a different point of view, if any, providing a supplementary note. The decisions or recommendations of the COS are unanimous. These proceedings are also circulated to and are followed up by the departments. There are other important functions which it discharges, viz.,\n\n• (i) Monitoring\n\n• (ii) Coordination\n\n• (iii) Promoting new policy initiatives\n\nThe Cabinet Secretariat is seen as a useful mechanism by the departments for promoting interministerial coordination since the Cabinet Secretary is also the head of the civil services. The Secretaries feel it necessary to keep the Cabinet Secretary informed of developments from time to time. The Transaction of Business Rules also requires them to keep the Cabinet Secretary informed of developments from time to time, specially if there are any departures from these rules.",

    "text": "The office of Cabinet Secretary was created in India in 1950. Its first occupant was N.R. Pillai.\n\nA Cabinet Secretary is the head of the Cabinet Secretariat. He succeeded the Secretary to the Governor-General's Executive Council.\n\nHe is given a top place among the civil servants in the official warrant of precedence. Thus, he is the senior most civil servant in India. Such a status to a Cabinet Secretary was recommended by the\n\nGopalaswamy Ayyangar Report on Reorganisation of the Machinery of Government (1949). However, his tenure of office is not fixed.\n\nThe following points highlight the role, powers and functions of a Cabinet Secretary.\n\n• (i) He is the chief coordinator of Central administration. But, he has no supervisory function over ministries/departments.\n\n• (ii) He is a Chairman of the Senior Selection Board which selects officers for the post of Joint Secretary in the Central Secretariat.\n\n• (iii) He himself selects the officers for the posts of Secretary and Additional Secretary in the Central Secretariat.\n\n• (iv) He is the Chairman of the Committee of Secretaries on Administration which is set up to resolve inter-ministerial disputes.\n\n• (v) He presides over the Conference of Chief Secretaries which is held annually.\n\n• (vi) He acts as a chief advisor to the Prime Minister on all aspects of administration and policy.\n\n• (vii) His sanction should be obtained by a minister before launching prosecution against the publisher or editor of newspaper in cases of defamation.\n\n• (viii) He serves on occasions as a factotum when the Prime Minister deems necessary and calls him to be so.\n\n• (ix) He acts as an advisor and conscience-keeper to all the civil servants. He advises and guides them on cases of inter-departmental difficulties.\n\n• (x) He acts as a link between the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) and various administrative agencies and also between the civil service and the political system.\n\nOn the role of a Cabinet Secretary, S.S. Khera, a former Cabinet Secretary, in his book, The Central Executive, observed that, \"The Cabinet Secretary provides the eyes and ears for the Prime Minister to keep in touch with the process of official business in the Central Government. But he is in no sense a watchdog or an invigilator on behalf of the Prime Minister... A Cabinet Secretary's is a very general staff function, not a line function in relation to the ministries. His business is to help, not to oversee.\"",

    "text": "The role of PMO varied from Prime Minister to Prime Minister. Over the years, it has grown very big and powerful and started functioning on a scale that was not anticipated at the time of its inception in 1947.\n\nDuring the prime ministership of Jawaharlal Nehru, the PMO was small in the size and played a limited role, but Lal Bahadur Shastri, who succeeded Nehru, strengthened the PMO and made it a powerful organ. The same trend was continued by Indira Gandhi also. In 1977, the Janata Government took measures to de-emphasise its dominant role, including the change of its nomenclature (i.e., from Prime Minister's secretariat to Prime Minister's Office). However, when Indira Gandhi returned to power after the collapse of the short-lived Janata Government, she again strengthened the PMO. This trend continued during Rajiv Gandhi's time and continues till today.\n\nAt present, the PMO has over 350 people under its roof. This large establishment runs a 'parallel' administration, that is, every ministry/department of the Central Government is duplicated here. This trend has damaged the prestige of ministers and the authority of departmental bureaucracy.\n\nThus, the PMO emerged as a rival centre of power at the official level and to that extent the 'legitimate' role, significance, authority and position of the Cabinet Secretariat and Cabinet Secretary in the Indian Cabinet System of government have gone down. As rightly said by Ajay K. Mehra, \"Constitutional practice recognises the Cabinet Secretariat, not the PMO, as the supporting institution for the apex executive body. The controversy over the PMO, therefore, is not merely with regard to its enjoying power disproportionate to its political location, the issue is that it has completely eclipsed the Cabinet Secretariat.\"\n\nTherefore, the critics have described the PMO variously as 'Super Cabinet', 'Micro Cabinet', 'Super Ministry', Super Secretariat', 'Supra-authority', 'the Government of India', 'the Government of the Government of India' and so on.",

Besides, All-India Radio, Doordarshan,\n\nDefence Production Units, Atomic Power Projects, Government Printing Press are also organised as departmental undertakings. This pattern is usually used when the principle objective of an enterprise is to provide revenue.\n\nThe characteristics of a departmental undertaking form of organisation are:\n\n• (i) Its aggregate investment is wholly made by the Government. A private party is debarred from investing in it.\n\n• (ii) It is financed by annual appropriations from the treasury. Also, all its revenues or a major part of it are paid into the treasury.\n\n• (iii) It is subject to budget, accounting and audit controls, which are applicable to other government departments.\n\n• (iv) Its parmanent staff consists of civil servants. Also, their methods of recruitment and service conditions are ordinarily the same as other civil servants (i.e. government staff).\n\n• (v) It is generally organised as a major sub-division of one of the departments of the Government and is subject to direct control of the head of the department.\n\n• (vi) It possesses sovereign immunity of the state and cannot be sued without the consent of the government.\n\n• (vii) It is accountable to the Parliament through the concerned minister.\n\n• (viii) It is created by an executive resolution, prior approval of the Parliament is not required to create it.\n\nThe advantages of a departmental undertaking form of organisation are:\n\n• (i) It provides for a maximum degree of control by a minister who is politically responsible to the Parliament.\n\n• (ii) It facilitates a clear relationship with other parts of the governmental structure.\n\n• (iii) It enables the Government to have better control over its funds. Thus it prevents the public money from being misappropriated and misused.\n\n• (iv) It is a well-known form of organisation, having fixed rules and standard patterns.\n\n• (v) It is most suitable for those enterprises which are set up for special reasons like defence, strategic importance, national security, economic control, financial control, safeguarding public interest, and so on.\n\nThe disadvantages of a departmental undertaking form of organisation are:\n\n• (i) It directly negates the requirements of autonomy due to excessive control.\n\n• (ii) It militates against initiative and flexibility of the enterprise.\n\n• (iii) It leads to rigid financial and budgetary control.\n\n• (iv) It has rigidity of rules and regulations and red tape leading to delays.\n\n• (v) It does not facilitate sufficient delegation of authority due to over centralisation.\n\nTherefore, this form of organisation is not used for economic and financial enterprises in recent times because of its inherent characteristics of rigidity and delays.",

    "text": "A public corporation as a form of public enterprise developed in the second half of 20th century. W.A. Robson said, \"Public Corporation is the most important invention of the twentieth century in the sphere of government institutions.\"\n\nSome important public corporations of Central Government are:\n\n• (i) Reserve Bank of India (1935)\n\n• (ii) Damodar Valley Corporation (1948)\n\n• (iii) Industrial Finance Corporation of India (1948)\n\n• (iv) Indian Airlines Corporation (1953)\n\n• (v) Air India International (1953)\n\n• (vi) State Bank of India (1955)\n\n• (vii) Life Insurance Corporation of India (1956)\n\n• (viii) Central Warehousing Corporation (1957)\n\n• (ix) Oil and Natural Gas Commission (1959)\n\n• (x) Food Corporation of India (1964)\n\nSome important public corporations of state governments are:\n\n• (i) State Road Transport Corporations\n\n• (ii) State Financial Corporations\n\n• (iii) State Electricity Boards\n\n• (iv) State Land Mortgage Banks\n\nThe characteristics of a public corporation form of organisation are:\n\n• (i) It is wholly owned by state, that is, its entire capital is provided by the government.\n\n• (ii) It is created by (or pursuant to) a special law of legislature (either Central or state). This special statute defines its objectives, powers, duties and privileges and also prescribes the form of management and its relationship to the government departments.\n\n• (iii) It (as a corporate body) has a separate entity for legal purposes and can sue and be sued, enter into contracts and acquire property in its name.\n\n• (iv) It is usually independently financed except for appropriations to provide capital or to cover losses. It obtains its funds from borrowing (either from the treasury or the public) and from revenues derived from the sale of its goods and services. It is authorised to use and reuse its revenues.\n\n• (v) It is generally exempted from most regulatory and prohibitory statutes applicable to the expenditure of public funds.\n\n• (vi) It is ordinarily not subject to budget, accounting and audit laws and procedures which are applicable to non-corporate agencies (government departments).\n\n• (vii) Its employees (in the majority of cases) are not civil servants and are recruited and remunerated under terms and conditions which are determined by the corporation itself.\n\n• (viii) It enjoys functional autonomy and is not subject to direct control of the head of the department (the minister) in its normal operations. Except for the formal policy directions issued to it by a minister, it is guided (in its functioning) by the statute which created it. It is managed by a Board of Directors appointed by the Government. One of the directors is appointed as the\n\nChairman of the Board.\n\nThe advantages of a public corporation form of organisation are:\n\n• (i) It facilitates autonomy in its day-to-day administration\n\n• (ii) It provides freedom from political influences and partisan considerations.\n\n• (iii) It provides for a healthy synthesis of commercial efficiency of a private enterprise with public accountability of a government department.\n\n• (iv) It provides freedom from unsuitable rules, regulations and controls of the government.\n\n• (v) It facilitates a high degree of financial flexibility and personnel autonomy.\n\n• (vi) It is a valuable instrument for social control of economic life.\n\nThe disadvantages of a public corporation form of organisation are:\n\n• (i) It is inherently rigid and ill-suited to meet the requirements of changing times. This means that a change in its structure or procedure or other aspects can be effected only by a statutory amendment (by the legislature).\n\n• (ii) It gives rise to the problems of reconciling administrative autonomy with public accountability.\n\n• (iii) It does not facilitate clear distinction between the \"matters of policy\" and \"matters of day-today administration.\"\n\n• (iv) It places significant political power in the hands of a small unrepresentative, and in extreme cases, a self-perpetuating group which controls and manages it.\n\n• (v) It, in practice, does not facilitate flexibility and autonomy in both financial and administrative aspects. The ministries look upon the corporations as their wings or branches and issue orders and directions in a similar way.",

    "text": "A government company is the most popular and extensively used form of organisation for management of public enterprises (both industrial as well as commercial) in India. It is registered under the Indian Companies Act of 1956. This Act defines a government company as one in which not less than 51% of the share capital is held either by the Central Government or the state government(s) or partly by the Central Government and partly by the state government(s). A government company can be wholly owned by the Government (i.e. the total share capital is invested by the Government) or can be partially owned by the Government (i.e. 51 per cent of the share capital is invested by the Government and the remaining capital furnished by private enterprises). Thus, the latter type of government company is also known as a mixed-ownership company as it comprises a joint enterprise in which the share capital is shared between the Government and the private interests, which can be either national or foreign. By acquiring 51 per cent or above of the share capital, the Government becomes the de facto (real) controller of the affairs of the mixed ownership company. This is why it is called a government company.\n\nThe Indian Companies Act of 1956 recognises two forms of companies—private limited company and public limited company. The differences between these two forms are mentioned below in Table 3.2.",

Hence, the governments in India have preferred the private limited company.\n\nSome important Government companies are:\n\n• (i) Bharat Heavy Electricals (Private) Limited\n\n• (ii) Hindustan Antibiotics Limited\n\n• (iii) Bharat Electronics (Private) Limited\n\n• (iv) Rashtriya Fertilizers and Chemicals (Private) Limited\n\n• (v) Hindustan Machine Tools (Private) Limited\n\n• (vi) Hindustan Cable (Private) Limited\n\n• (vii) Hindustan Housing Factory (Private) Limited\n\n• (viii) Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited\n\n• (ix) Hindustan Insecticides (Private) Limited\n\n• (x) Shipping Corporation of India Limited\n\n• (xi) Hindustan Shipyard Limited\n\n• (xii) Maruti Udyog Limited\n\n• (xiii) Indian Telephone Industries Limited\n\n• (xiv) National Coal Development Corporation\n\n• (xv) Heavy Engineering Corporation\n\n• (xvi) India Tourism Development Corporation\n\n• (xvii) Indian Oil Corporation\n\nIt should be noted here that some of the Government companies use the word 'corporation,' but they are actually organised as Government companies. For example, Fertilizer Corporation of India, Indian Oil Corporation.\n\nThe characteristics of a Government company form of organisation are:\n\n• (i) It has most of the features of a private limited company.\n\n• (ii) It is either wholly owned by the government or 51 per cent (or above) of the capital stock is owned by the Government.\n\n• (iii) It is created by an executive resolution under the general law, that is, the Indian Companies Act of 1956. The executive need not seek the approval of legislature.\n\n• (iv) It is a body corporate and has a separate entity for legal purposes and can sue and be sued,\n\nenter into contracts and acquire property in its name.\n\n• (v) Its Articles of Association (which lays down the rules of internal management) are drawn up and revisable by the Government.\n\n• (vi) Its funds are obtained from the Government and, in some cases, from private shareholders, and through revenues derived from the sale of its goods and services.\n\n• (vii) It is ordinarily not subject to budget, accounting and audit laws and procedures which are applicable to Government departments.\n\n• (viii) Its employees (excluding the deputationists) are not civil servants and are recruited and remunerated under terms and conditions which are determined by the company itself.\n\n• (ix) All the directors or a majority of them are appointed by the Government depending upon the extent to which private capital is participating in the enterprises.\n\nThe advantages of a government company form of organisation or the reasons for its popularity in India are:\n\n• (i) It facilitates ease and convenience in forming an enterprise. This is so because it can be created by an executive decision without Parliamentary approval. This is the principal reason for its popularity.\n\n• (ii) It provides for sufficient government control.\n\n• (iii) It enables association with private enterprise.\n\n• (iv) It facilitates autonomy in day-to-day administration.\n\n• (v) It provides for a high degree of financial flexibility and personnel autonomy.\n\n• (vi) It provides for easy expansion and extension.\n\nThe disadvantages of a government company form of organisation are:\n\n• (i) It evades constitutional responsibilities which a state-controlled enterprise has in a democratic society towards the government and to the Parliament. This is the reason why it was described by a former Comptroller and Auditor General of India as \"a fraud on the Company's Act and on the Constitution of India.\" Lanka Sundaram described it as \"an imperium in imperio\" (a small kingdom within a kingdom).\n\n• (ii) The use of the company form and of the law regulating commercial companies, usually becomes a mere fiction because all or most of the functions normally vested in the shareholders and in the management, are reserved to the government by the statute setting up the company.\n\n• (iii) It, in practice, does not facilitate flexibility and autonomy in both financial and administrative aspects. The Estimates Committee of Lok Sabha said, \"the companies are more or less extensions of departments ... and are run almost on the same pattern, with minor changes here and there.\"\n\nThe question of suitability of the forms of public enterprise was examined by various committees and commissions. The following points can be noted in this regard.\n\n• (i) A.D. Gorwala in his Report on the Efficient Conduct of State Enterprises (1951) considered government company form superior to public corporation form because of its flexibility.\n\n• (ii) The First Five-Year Plan document supported the adoption of Government Company form.\n\n• (iii) The Estimates Committee of Lok Sabha (1960) recommended in favour of public corporation\n\nform for organising public enterprises.\n\n• (iv) The Krishna Menon Committee suggested the adoption of public corporation form.\n\n• (v) The Administrative Reforms Commission favoured the adoption of public corporation form in general in organising public enterprises.",
