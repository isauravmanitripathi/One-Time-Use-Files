# **SAVING CLAUSES** *the Ninth Schedule and Articles 31A–C*

# SURYA DEVA\*

## **I. INTRODUCTION**

THIS chapter seeks to examine critically the drafting history, nature, scope, (mis)use, and relevance of a unique and exceptional set of provisions of the Indian Constitution: Article 31A, Article 31B read with the Ninth Schedule, and Article 31C. For the sake of convenience, these provisions will be referred to as 'saving clauses' in this chapter.

The saving clauses were not part of the original constitutional text. Whereas Article 31A and Article 31B read with the Ninth Schedule were inserted with retrospective effect by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act 1951, Article 31C was inserted by the Constitution (Twenty-fifth Amendment) Act 1971. Although the scope and ambit of the three provisions vary, they basically seek to protect laws aimed at agrarian reforms or implementing certain Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs) from a potential constitutional challenge on the ground of violating fundamental rights (FRs). The saving clauses are unique because similar provisions might not be present in any other liberal constitution of the world. They are also exceptional in that they expressly permit certain types of laws to override FRs.

I advance three claims in relation to the saving clauses. First, I offer an alternative reading of the saving clauses by positing that they should be seen as a legislative reaction to judicial overreach reflected in an overzealous protection of the erstwhile FR to property against legislation aimed at securing socio-economic justice.

Secondly, while the Ninth Schedule has been misused in the past, especially during the brief national emergency, there are reasons suggesting that this exceptional constitutional device might not be abused in future. I also contend that courts should play a limited role and that the basic structure doctrine is inappropriate to test the validity of laws inserted in the Ninth Schedule.

Thirdly, it appears that the judiciary misunderstood the dominant vision of the Constitution makers as to the place of the right to property as an FR as well as the value of DPSPs *vis-à-vis* FRs. Courts also misconstrued their role in relation to DPSPs by not according adequate deference to legislative measures that sought to establish an egalitarian society. In hindsight, it would have been more appropriate if the courts had shared the constitutional space of understanding the constitutional vision with the other two government branches. Doing so might have pre-empted the need for the saving clauses and their subsequent misuse.

# **II. ORIGIN OF SAVING CLAUSES: AN ALTERNATIVE READING**

Although the saving clauses are found in <u>Part III</u> dealing with FRs, they basically impose restriction

on FRs.<sup>1</sup> The dominant discourse perceives the insertion of these saving provisions (Articles 31A– 31C and the Ninth Schedule) as an abuse of power by a dominant Parliament coupled with strong Prime Ministers.<sup>2</sup> However, I will suggest the origin of these provisions could also be understood as a parliamentary reaction to judicial overreach in giving the then FR to property an overzealous protection against legislatives measures aimed at securing socio-economic justice—a constitutional goal regarded as 'fundamental in the governance' of the country.

Constitutions perform, among others, a guidance role: $3$  they prod all the relevant stakeholders to behave in a particular manner. This dynamic creates mutual expectations amongst different constitutional functionaries as to how others will behave. However, if one organ (say X) deviates from a given understanding of its role by other organs (say Y and Z), this may trigger reactions from Y and Z. The consequent cycle of actions and reactions dents trust among peer institutions, destroys the fine balance of power, and in turn leads to a battle of supremacy.

Against this analytical matrix, I argue that the origin of the saving clauses lies in the tussle between the judiciary and the executive–legislature over the right to property. $\frac{4}{3}$  This tussle started just after the promulgation of the Constitution, when the Patna High Court declared unconstitutional a land reform law on the ground that it violated the right to equality under Article  $14.5$  The Constituent Assembly acting as provisional legislature—did not waste much time in responding by inserting Articles 31A and 31B by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act 1951.<sup>6</sup> It is quite significant that the need to insert these provisions was felt by the same people who had drafted the Constitution with a particular vision for the society that a free India should have.<sup>7</sup>

These two provisions sought to protect agrarian reform and *zamindari <sup>8</sup>* abolition laws from any constitutional challenge on the ground of violation of FRs, <sup>9</sup> because 'dilatory litigation' was holding up these 'important measures affecting large numbers of people'. $\frac{10}{10}$  Nehru also felt that the responsibility for the economic and social welfare policies of the nation should lie with Parliament and not with the courts.<sup>11</sup> Article 31A, therefore, provided that no law dealing with certain proprietary interests—such as the acquisition of estate, taking over of the management of any property for a limited period, the amalgamation of two or more corporations and extinguishment of mineral leases—shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it takes away or abridges any FR under Article 14 or Article  $19<sup>12</sup>$  Article 31B, on the other hand, crafted a unique protective umbrella<sup>13</sup> for legislation by providing that no law included in the Ninth Schedule shall be deemed to be void on the ground of being inconsistent with any of the  $FRs.$ <sup>14</sup> As compared to Article 31A, the ambit of Article 31B is wider because the latter renders inoperative all FRs for laws listed in the Ninth Schedule.

Soon thereafter, the battle for supremacy shifted to the quantum of compensation to be paid for acquiring private property for public purposes. The Constitution framers did not consciously qualify the term 'compensation' in Article 31 by any adjective such as 'fair', 'just', or 'reasonable'.<sup>15</sup> Nevertheless, the Supreme Court in *State of West Bengal v Bela Banerjee* held that a provision that fixed the compensation without reference to the value of the land was arbitrary and breached the protection afforded to the right to property under Article  $31(2)$ .<sup>16</sup> In other words, the compensation should be a 'just equivalent' of what the owner has been deprived of. In some other cases dealing with regulation of industry, the Court held that the payment of compensation could be necessary even for restricting the exercise of property rights.<sup>17</sup> These judicial decisions provided impetus for Parliament to amend the Constitution again in 1955.<sup>18</sup> This amendment of Article 31 made the adequacy of compensation non-justiciable and also laid down that no acquisition or requisition of

property takes place unless there is a transfer of ownership or the right to possession. So, compensation will not be required if property rights are limited by ways other than acquisition or requisition.

Despite these amendments, the Supreme Court continued with its 'private property-protecting' interpretations and decisions. For example, it held that although Compensation is not required by law to be adequate, it must yet not be 'illusory'.<sup>19</sup> The Court also struck down the bank nationalisation law for not providing compensation as per the relevant principles. <sup>20</sup> The Court in *IC Golak Nath v State of Punjab* went a step further and held that Parliament cannot amend FRs, even while exercising its constituent power to amend the Constitution.<sup>21</sup>

Parliament was not, however, willing to accept this judicial position easily. It restored Parliament's power to amend FRs by revising the text of Article 368 by the Twenty-fourth Amendment. Moreover, a new saving provision, Article 31C, was inserted by the Twenty-fifth Amendment. Article 31C was of far-reaching importance as it provided that no law giving effect to certain DPSPs—Article  $39(b)/(c)$ —shall be declared void by the courts on the ground of being inconsistent with FRs under Article 14 or Article 19. If such a law contained a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy, courts will be barred from reviewing whether the law seeks to further the said DPSPs or not. The original text of Article 31C was amended further by the Forty-second Amendment: the scope of the provision was extended to cover all DPSPs.

The constitutional validity of Article 31C was challenged in *Kesavananda Bharati v State of Kerala*. <sup>22</sup> The majority held that Parliament has the power to amend FRs as long as they are not part of the 'basic structure' of the Constitution, which cannot be amended. The Court thus overruled *Golak Nath* on this point, but at the same time put an implied and open-ended limitation on the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution. The Supreme Court also declared invalid that part of Article 31C which sought to exclude judicial review. $\frac{23}{10}$  The battle of supremacy between the Supreme Court and Parliament by and large came to an end with the deletion of the right to property (Article 31) as an FR by the Forty-fourth Amendment and the Court in *Minerva Mills* declaring the balance between FRs and DPSPs to be a basic feature of the Constitution. $\frac{24}{3}$ 

#### **III. TAXONOMYOFTHE NINTH SCHEDULE'S (MIS)USE**

It is largely uncontroversial that the Ninth Schedule has been used for purposes other than for which it was conceived by the Constituent Assembly acting as the provisional legislature for an independent India. The misuse of the Ninth Schedule concerns both the *process* by which laws are included and the *outcome* of inclusion (how many and what types of laws are included in the Ninth Schedule). As far as the process of inclusion is concerned, one may notice non-application of mind before inserting laws in the Ninth Schedule and the lack of subsequent supervision of the included laws.

On the other hand, in terms of the outcome, a statistical analysis of the laws inserted in the Ninth Schedule reveals two interrelated types of misuse: excessive use and colourable use.<sup>25</sup> Excessive use is problematic because if too many laws are included in the Ninth Schedule over the years, then the exception might become the general norm, thus creating a constitutional black hole. On the other hand, colourable use is problematic simply because the power under Article 31B is exercised for the wrong purposes by making a departure from the original intent.

## **1. Lack of Application of Mind and Oversight**

Considering the exceptional nature of the power under Article 31B, it should be incumbent on Parliament to apply its mind carefully before including a law in the Ninth Schedule and then continuously monitor the status of included laws. However, it seems that Parliament has not been able to discharge either of these responsibilities.

The process of en masse inclusion of laws $\frac{26}{1}$  indicates that Parliament might not be applying its mind before inserting each law in the Ninth Schedule. Moreover, since it is only the title of laws, rather than the entire text of laws, that is included in the Ninth Schedule, it is very likely that members may not even read the legal provisions receiving the unique constitutional protection. Non-application of mind is especially worrisome because insertion of a law in the Ninth Schedule will result in a very limited judicial scrutiny of the constitutionality of such law.

It also seems that Parliament does not monitor the status of laws subsequent to their insertion in the Ninth Schedule.<sup>27</sup> An overwhelming number of the current Ninth Schedule laws (250 out of 282) are State laws, which can be amended or even repealed by the respective State legislatures. Consequently, if a Ninth Schedule law is amended by a State legislature after its insertion in the Schedule, this will deprive Parliament the power to review the text and its potential impact on FRs before inserting such a law in the Ninth Schedule. Lack of any post-insertion oversight will provide an opportunity for misuse of the Ninth Schedule.

It is worth noting that Articles 31A and 31C have an inbuilt check to prevent such an abuse: a State law will get the protection of these special provisions only after such law is reserved for consideration by the President and receives his assent. Article 31B does not, however, have any comparable safeguard.

## **2. Excessive Use**

Figure 35.1 shows the number of laws inserted in the Ninth Schedule during the tenure of different Prime Ministers. It is clear that almost half of the laws were inserted during Indira Gandhi's tenure as Prime Minister—138 laws out a total number of 285 laws.<sup>28</sup> Ffity-five laws were inserted during the tenure of VP Singh, while forty-four were inserted during the Lal Bahadur Shastri's tenure.<sup>29</sup> It is significant that no laws were inserted in the Ninth Schedule during the tenure of several Prime Ministers: Morarji Desai, Charan Singh, Rajiv Gandhi, Chandra Shekhar, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, HD Deve Gowda, IK Gujral, and Manmohan Singh. With the exception of Rajiv Gandhi, the rest of these Prime Ministers led a coalition government with no strong majority in the Lok Sabha, Parliament's Lower House. Several of these Prime Ministers were also at the helm for a short duration (less than one year). This may suggest that the Ninth Schedule was (mis)used more when Prime Ministers enjoyed a stable majority in the Lok Sabha.<sup>30</sup>

As compared to Indira Gandhi, the relative number of laws inserted in the Ninth Schedule is much smaller for VP Singh and Shastri. However, if we take into account the very short stint enjoyed by both Shastri and VP Singh, the yearly average of laws inserted in the Ninth Schedule during the tenure of Shastri and VP Singh is much higher than that of Indira Gandhi. As Figure 35.2 shows, the average for Shastri and VP Singh was 27.5 and 53.9, respectively. The yearly average for Indira Gandhi was merely 11.1 (during her first stint, including when Emergency was imposed) and 3.4 (during her second stint). One may then conclude that Indira Gandhi was perhaps not that big a user of the Ninth Schedule as she has been perceived to be, especially if we take out the Emergency period.

Nevertheless, the excessive use of the Ninth Schedule runs counter to the idea of constitutionalism, because an exception should not be allowed to become the general norm, otherwise it will result in creating a constitutional black hole. The mere presence of close to 300 laws in the Ninth Schedule raises this concern.

### **3. Colourable Use**

Perhaps the more problematic misuse of the Ninth Schedule concerns the colourable exercise of power under Article 31B. There is no express requirement in Article 31B that the laws inserted in the Ninth Schedule should be related to agrarian reforms or the right to property. However, taking into account the drafting history of Article  $31B<sup>31</sup>$  and its wide protective ambit,  $\frac{32}{1}$  it is appropriate to construe the scope of this provision narrowly. I will suggest that the power under Article 31B should be limited to the original intent behind this provision (ie, saving agrarian reforms or the *zamindari*
abolition laws from challenge on the touchstone of FRs), rather than for achieving 'unrelated' objectives.

In practice, however, the Ninth Schedule has been used to shield laws concerning a wide range of subject matters—from land reforms to bonded labour, price of essential goods, trade monopoly, election, internal security, and foreign exchange. Out of 282 laws in the Ninth Schedule currently, the majority of laws (253 in total) deal with various types of agrarian reforms or the abolition of the zamindari system. The remaining twenty-nine laws deal with diverse 'unrelated' aspects,  $\frac{33}{12}$  and a few of them have no relation with even the right to property; for example, the Representation of the People Act 1951 or the Maintenance of Internal Security Act  $1971.34$  It is crucial to note that out of these twenty-nine 'unrelated' laws, twenty-five were enacted during the period when Indira Gandhi had imposed National Emergency. This seems to indicate that the Ninth Schedule has not generally been misused to shield 'unrelated' laws during normal times.

Since 1995, no new law has been included in the Ninth Schedule. But could this situation change in the future and result in a revival of the twofold misuse? In view of a number of reasons, it is unlikely that the Ninth Schedule would be misused in the future to the same extent or frequency as has happened in the past. First of all, many of the laws had to be inserted in the Ninth Schedule because of a *reaction* to overzealous judicial protection of the right to property and/or its non-sympathetic attitude towards socio-economic reforms aimed at implementing DPSPs. This phase is arguably over now, so in the future we might not see any wholesale importation of laws into the Ninth Schedule.

Secondly, the advent of the free market economy since the early 1990s should also limit significantly the incentives for the government to insert laws into the Ninth Schedule.<sup>35</sup> As **Figure** 35.3 depicts, we are well past the peak (from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s) with a sharp high point during the Emergency in the mid-1970s. The non-inclusion of any law in the post-1995 period may be explained by the fact that, as opposed to the past push for nationalisation, the Indian government in the past two decades has been pushing for privatisation and disinvestment. The government has also exercised its power to acquire land for business projects of corporate actors with no clear or immediate public interest advantage—thus, land redistribution to landless poor people is being replaced with land accumulation for rich business interests.

Thirdly, the judicial decisions holding that the constitutional validity of laws inserted in the Ninth Schedule could be tested on the touchstone of the basic structure doctrine should caution Parliament to be more careful and selective in inserting laws in the Ninth Schedule. This aspect is discussed further below.

#### **IV. MISUSE OFTHE NINTH SCHEDULE AND THE JUDICIARY**

What should be the role of the Indian judiciary in pre-empting or redressing the misuse of the Ninth Schedule? Considering the exceptional nature of the Article 31B power, the temptation of constitutional lawyers would be to insist on rigorous judicial scrutiny of the parliamentary exercise of power in this area. However, I contend that the judiciary should show adequate deference to Parliament in implementing the constitutional vision behind the Ninth Schedule.

# **1. Sharing of Constitutional Space**

In most of the common law jurisdictions, it is widely accepted that courts have the final say in interpreting what the Constitution means.<sup>36</sup> However, relying on the work of Waldron canvassing for limited judicial review<sup>37</sup> and Tushnet cautioning against judicial supremacy,  $\frac{38}{3}$  I propose the idea of a 'shared constitutional space' in understanding constitutional values underpinning given provisions of the Constitution. Instead of either the judiciary or the legislature having an exclusive say in unpacking the constitutional vision and applying it, this space should be shared amongst all three branches of the government, with each branch showing some deference to the other branches. In fact, lack of such mutual deference is likely to result in battles of supremacy between different government organs and the creation of new constitutional *defensive devices* (eg, the Ninth Schedule) or *attacking devices* (eg, the basic structure doctrine).

Consistent with the 'shared constitutional space' idea, I will argue below that courts should only have a limited judicial review power in relation to laws inserted in the Ninth Schedule. Apart from ensuring compliance with procedural safeguards governing the exercise of amendment power and the provisions concerning legislative competence, the Supreme Court should merely ensure that Parliament does not use its power in a colourable manner. In other words, all laws inserted in the Ninth Schedule must be directed at achieving the original purpose behind the First Constitutional Amendment, otherwise they should lose the protective umbrella of the Ninth Schedule. By the same logic, the court should not allow Parliament to expand its power under Article 31B beyond the original intent of this provision.

If the Supreme Court could show deference to Parliament in other matters which impinge upon core human rights, <sup>39</sup> there is no reason why the Court should be overly worried about certain legislative measures that seek to accomplish core constitutional goals of securing socio-economic justice and equality to all citizens.

I examine below the suitability of the basic structure doctrine in testing the constitutional validity of laws inserted in the Ninth Schedule. But in the context of the idea of 'shared constitutional space' advanced here, it is arguable that Article 31B read with the Ninth Schedule itself should be regarded as a basic feature of the Constitution. They are legislative counterparts to subsequent judicial crystallisation of core values in the form of the basic structure doctrine. If there are certain basic features of the Constitution beyond the purview of the amendment power, why should the judiciary be the sole judge in determining the contours of these features? In fact, the Constituent Assembly should be in a better position to take this call, as reflected expressly in the text of many constitutions from all over the world. $\frac{40}{1}$ 

It is worth remembering that Article 31B read with the Ninth Schedule was inserted by the then Constituent Assembly acting as the provisional Parliament soon after the Constitution was adopted. If the Constitution makers (albeit acting as legislators) considered the need for taking such exceptional measures to achieve certain constitutional goals, these saving provisions should be treated as basic features of the Indian Constitution. As compared to a handful of judges who were not involved in drafting the Constitution, several hundred drafters of the Constitution acting together as a body should not only be in a much better position, but also have more legitimacy to distil what amounts to the core fundamental tenets of the Constitution.

### **2. Ninth Schedule and the Basic Structure Doctrine**

After the judgment in *Kesavananda*, a key issue is whether the basic structure doctrine controls Parliament's power to insert laws into the Ninth Schedule or not. $\frac{41}{1}$  In the early 1980s, the Supreme Court in *Waman Rao v Union of India*<sup> $42$ </sup> and *Minerva Mills v Union of India*<sup> $43$ </sup> held that laws included in the Ninth Schedule after the date of decision in *Kesavananda* (ie, 24 April 1973) will be subject to judicial scrutiny on the ground that they damage the basic structure of the Constitution.

More recently, a nine-judge bench of the Court in *IR Coelho v State of Tamil Nadu*, <sup>44</sup> considered the question whether, in light of the basic structure doctrine, legislation inserted by Parliament into the Ninth Schedule would be immune automatically from judicial review. Emphasising the nature of 'fictional immunity' granted by Article 31B to laws placed in the Ninth Schedule,  $\frac{45}{ }$  the Court unanimously held that the validity of any law placed in the Ninth Schedule after 24 April 1973 may still be tested by courts against the basic structure doctrine. The Court reasoned that if the amendment power under Article 368 is not unlimited, the power to amend the Ninth Schedule—which flows from Article 368—can also not confer 'unlimited or unregulated immunity'.  $\frac{46}{1}$ 

In determining the validity of a law in relation to the basic structure doctrine, reference must be had to the actual effect and impact of the law on  $FRs$ .<sup>47</sup> If the law infringes the 'essence of any of the fundamental rights or any other aspect of the basic structure',  $\frac{48}{3}$  it should be struck down, with the extent of abrogation and limit of abridgement to be determined on a case-by-case basis. The Court ruled that it has the power to look at 'the terms of the statute' in question to determine whether the statute violates certain basic features or not.<sup>49</sup>

The Court in *Coelho* also opined that the original intent of Article 31B to protect a limited number of laws had been overlooked and that there had been 'unchecked and rampant exercise' of the power granted therein by Parliament.<sup>50</sup> The 'absence of guidelines for exercise of such power' and the resultant absence of constitutional control may result in the 'destruction of constitutional supremacy and the creation of parliamentary hegemony'.<sup>51</sup>

Although the Court in *Coelho* at times observed that the validity of any Ninth Schedule law can be tested on the touchstone of the basic structure, it seems that the intent is to limit the ground of challenge only to those FRs that are part of the basic structure.<sup>52</sup> This is clear from the two-stage validity test laid down by the Court.<sup>53</sup> The same inference could be drawn from a rule stipulated in *Coelho*—which was confirmed later in *Dropti Devi v Union of India <sup>54</sup>*—that once the validity of any Ninth Schedule law has been upheld by the apex court, it will not be permitted to challenge again the constitutional validity of such law on the ground of the principles laid down in the *Coelho* judgment. In other words, if a Ninth Schedule law violated a basic feature of the Constitution (such as separation of powers or democracy) but not any of the FRs, it will be safe.<sup>55</sup>

It also appears that the Supreme Court is drawing a distinction between the specific text of certain FRs and the principles underlying them, which could be part of the basic structure. While testing the validity of a Ninth Schedule law, regard should be made to the broad underlying principles, thus giving courts greater flexibility in upholding the validity of such laws. In *Glanrock Estate Pvt Ltd v State of Tamil Nadu*, the Court observed:

<sup>[</sup>I]t is only that breach of the principle of equality which is of the character of destroying the basic framework of the Constitution which will not be protected by Article 31B. If every breach of Article 14, however egregious, is held to be unprotected by Article 31B, there would be no purpose in protection by Article 31B.<sup>56</sup>

This again indicates that the grounds of judicial review to challenge the constitutional validity of a Ninth Schedule law are quite narrow.

The above judicial position canvassed in *Coelho* and other earlier cases prima facie looks uncontroversial because laws could be introduced in the Ninth Schedule only by a constitutional amendment, which post-*Kesavananda* must not destroy the basic features of the Constitution. However, if one scratches the surface, a technical difficulty arises. A constitutional amendment that inserts laws in the Ninth Schedule has hardly any substantive content (apart from listing titles of laws) which courts can look into and then determine whether the amendment violates certain basic features or not.<sup>57</sup>

Relying on this logic, MP Singh argues that since legislation cannot be challenged on the ground of violating the basic structure, 'it is inconceivable that an amendment which introduces a legislation in the Ninth Schedule could be challenged'.<sup>58</sup> This argument has some logic because the basic structure doctrine limits only the amendment power of Parliament and not its ordinary law-making power.<sup>59</sup> While interpreting *Coelho*, the then Chief justice Kapadia in *Glanrock Estate Ltd* drew a clearer distinction between testing the validity of an 'ordinary law' and a 'constitutional amendment'.  $\frac{60}{ }$ 

Moreover, it can be contended that if we allow the constitutional validity of all laws to be tested with reference to an open-ended list of abstract overarching constitutional principles (ie, basic features), then this will introduce a significant amount of uncertainty and unpredictability into the ordinary law-making process. Considering that the Indian Supreme Court operates in multiple benches, different benches may interpret even the same principles variedly and thus send mixed signals to Parliament, as well as people affected by such laws.<sup>61</sup>

On the other hand, it can be said that the judiciary—as the Court reasoned in *Coelho*—should be able to look at the content of laws included in a constitutional amendment, for the form of the amendment does not really matter and the content of such laws is as good as part of the amendment text. Alternatively, there is nothing that prevents courts from ruling in future that the validity of even ordinary laws could be tested with reference to the basic features of the Constitution. After all, the 'basic structure could not be violated indirectly by inserting unconstitutional laws in the Ninth Schedule'.<sup>62</sup>

How to resolve this question then about the relationship between the Ninth Schedule and the basic structure doctrine? While it is outside the purview of this chapter to examine the merits of the basic structure doctrine,  $\frac{63}{5}$  I suggest that courts should not employ the basic structure doctrine to test the validity of laws inserted in the Ninth Schedule. As I have indicated before and will show below in greater detail, Parliament felt the need to introduce the protective umbrella of the Ninth Schedule simply because courts were not showing adequate deference to the executive-cum-legislature's understanding of a constitutional vision of creating an egalitarian society. If courts rely on the basic structure doctrine to scuttle the effect of the Ninth Schedule, this would bring us back to a battle of supremacy, something that should be avoided.

# **V. JUDGING THE CONSTITUTIONAL VISION**

This part provides a brief mapping of the constitutional vision concerning two aspects—the relation to the right to property with other FRs, and the status of FRs *vis-à-vis* DPSPs—which are relevant to

the origin, scope, and (mis)use of the saving clauses. Like courts elsewhere, the Indian Supreme Court too has a legitimate role in interpreting the constitutional vision. However, the Indian experience shows that courts do not always capture well the vision espoused by the Constitution framers, leading to a clash with the other two organs of the government. Had the Court shared the space of judging the constitutional vision with the other two branches, we might have not seen the birth of the saving clauses and the Ninth Schedule's misuse.

#### **1. Right to Property versus Other Fundamental Rights**

The saving clauses operate as an exception, among others, to the constitutional protection of the right to property.<sup> $64$ </sup> Jain has rightly described the FR to property as 'the most controversial aspect of the Indian Constitution'.<sup>65</sup> During the drafting process, members of the Constituent Assembly discussed and disagreed for several months on the exact contours of the right to property. The key issue was if any adjective such as 'just', 'fair', 'adequate', or 'equitable' should be added before compensation that must be given by the State if it acquires personal property for public purposes.<sup>66</sup> The Constitution framers were clearly wary of giving courts the power to adjudicate on the sufficiency of compensation. At the same time, some members of assembly did not want to confer on the government an absolute right to acquire private property. Finally, a compromise was reached, as reflected in recognition of the FR to property under Article 31 and Article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution.

Nevertheless, to build an egalitarian society, the Constitution framers had envisaged that agrarian reforms would have to be carried out and the *zamindari* system would have to be abolished. They had also thought that the judiciary would not invoke the right to property to frustrate such policies.<sup>67</sup> During the Constituent Assembly debates, Pandit Nehru had observed that 'no Supreme Court and no judiciary can stand in judgment over the sovereign will of Parliament representing the will of the entire community'.<sup>68</sup> During the drafting of the Constitution, 'property' was delinked from 'life' and 'liberty'.<sup>69</sup> One can then say that although the Constituent Assembly decided to protect property as an FR,  $\frac{70}{2}$  it was not to be accorded the same level of protection as other FRs recognised in <u>Part III</u>.

The Indian Supreme Court, however, did not buy this socialist vision of the right to property. In fact, the Court had initially accorded more robust protection to property than liberty.<sup> $71$ </sup> The right to property as an FR under Article 31 was amended by Parliament on six occasions; $\frac{72}{12}$  the trigger for each amendment was some judicial decision which the government considered to be restricting the goals of establishing an egalitarian society. Ultimately, in 1978, Parliament had to delete both Articles 19(1)(f) and 31 from the list of FRs and provide protection to private property under Article 300A.

After reviewing various cases in which the FR to property was invoked, Upadhyaya concludes that the Court has 'done its best' to protect agrarian reforms over the years.<sup>73</sup> This conclusion, however, does not sit well with the constitutional reality examined by Austin in the form of a battle for supremacy between the judiciary and Parliament since the middle of the  $1960s$ .<sup>74</sup>

#### **2. Fundamental Rights versus Directive Principles**

FRs and DPSPs appear in separate parts of the Constitution. Although DPSPs are not justiciable, they are 'nevertheless *fundamental in the governance* of the country and it *shall* be the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws'.<sup>75</sup> The non-justiciable nature of DPSPs has been used by scholars to question their usefulness<sup> $76$ </sup> or to claim that they are inferior to FRs.<sup> $77$ </sup> This aspect also led the judiciary to conclude initially that FRs are superior to DPSPs. $\frac{78}{8}$ 

The clash as to the relative normative hierarchy of FRs and DPSPs led to the birth of saving clauses and also set the tone for several decades of battle for supremacy between the Supreme Court and Parliament.<sup>79</sup> It seems, however, that the Constitution framers did not intend to put FRs on a higher pedestal. The leaders of the independent movement drew no distinction between the positive (say DPSPs) and negative (say FRs) obligations of the State. $\frac{80}{10}$  Moreover, during the Constitution framing, some members of the Constituent Assembly had, in fact, demanded a justiciable status for DPSPs<sup>81</sup> and the unenforceable nature of DPSPs remained a constant source of criticism at various drafting stages.<sup>82</sup>

A compromise was, however, reached in the end because justiciability might not have been appropriate for DPSPs at that time.<sup>83</sup> But non-justiciability of DPSPs in itself should not be used as evidence of their status being inferior to that of FRs. 84 It was simply a matter of constitutional design that the Constitution makers vested the *exclusive* responsibility of implementing DPSPs on the other two government branches and excluded the judiciary from this role. This position is consistent with the 'progressive realisation' approach accepted at the international level in relation to socioeconomic rights. In fact, measures to implement even FRs are mostly taken by the executive/legislature. The judiciary is merely given a supervisory role. However, the Constitution did not envisage vesting the judiciary with a supervisory role in relation to DPSPs. This role was rather given to people and other stakeholders of democracy, such as the media.<sup>85</sup>

While the judiciary should act as a watchdog in supervising that the (non)actions of the executive/legislature do not result in violations of FRs, it has a very minimal role in supervising whether and how the government is implementing DPSPs. Courts should show full deference to the government in implementing DPSPs, considering that the government is constitutionally obliged to take DPSPs into account 'in making laws'. The role of the judiciary should be limited to controlling a colourable exercise of power by the government and striking a balance between FRs and DPSPs if required.

However, as we have seen, courts have exceeded their limited role canvassed here. Whether the superman-like role played by the judiciary has yielded positive benefits is debatable,  $\frac{86}{5}$  but this has resulted in at least two serious consequences. I have already alluded to the first one: courts' overreach triggered a backlash from Parliament and consequent insertion of exceptional provisions in the form of saving clauses. Secondly, judicial trespass into the supervisory domain meant for other democracy stakeholders has contributed to democratic deficits by undermining the evolution of alternative means of accountability critical for a vibrant democracy. Rather than acting as the sole custodian of DPSPs, the judiciary should have channelled grievances concerning bad implementation or non-implementation of DPSPs towards various other stakeholders of democracy.

# **VI. CONCLUSION**

The saving clauses—Article 31A, Article 32B read with the Ninth Schedule, and Article 31C—are very unique and exceptional provisions of the Indian Constitution. They are like a protective constitutional island, which enjoys a status higher to other parts of the Constitution. In this chapter, I have tried to offer an alternative reading of the origin and scope of the saving clauses: rather than being seen as an abuse of power by Parliament, their origin could be explained by the struggle for supremacy between the government and the judiciary. This struggle was (mostly) triggered by courts not showing adequate deference to legislative measures aimed at securing socio-economic justice and their overzealous protection of the FR to property. It also seems that the judiciary misunderstood their limited role in relation to the government's laws and policies that sought to implement DPSPs.

Although the saving clauses have been misused in the past, there are reasons to believe that in the future this trend may not continue. Nevertheless, courts should have a limited judicial review power to ensure that the Ninth Schedule is used only to serve the original purpose of saving agrarian reforms or the *zamindari* abolition from a potential constitutional challenge. It may also not be appropriate to test the validity of Ninth Schedule laws on the touchstone of the basic structure doctrine.

At a wider level, the Indian experience of saving clauses shows that while courts enjoy a primary role in unpacking the constitutional vision, they should also give some space to the other two government organs. The principle of shared constitutional space is preferable to conferring absolute authority of determining and realising constitutional values on any one institution, even if it is the judiciary.
