**CHAPTER 33 LANGUAGES** 

LANGUAGES offered a special problem to the makers of the Constitution simply because of the plurality of languages used by the vast population of 1,02,87,37,436 according to 2001 census

Languages. (vide India 2008, page 7). It is somewhat bewildering to think that no less than 1,652 spoken languages, including 63 non-Indian languages, are current in this sub-Continent.

The makers of the Constitution had, therefore, to select some of these languages as the recognised medium of official communication in order to save the country from a hopeless confusion. **Need** for  $\mathbf{a}$ Fortunately for them, the number of people speaking Official Language.

each of these 1,652 languages was not anything like proportionate and some 22<sup>1</sup> languages (included in the 8th Schedule of the Constitution, see Table XX) could easily be picked up as the major languages of India, used by 91 per cent of the total population of the country, and out of them, Hindi, including its kindred variants Urdu and Hindustani, could claim 46 per cent. Hindi Devanagari script was accordingly prescribed as the official language of the Union (subject to the continuance of English for the same purpose for the limited period of 15 years), and, for the development of the Hindi language as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India, the assimilation of the expressions used in the other languages specified in the Eighth Schedule was recommended [Art. 351].

But though one language was thus prescribed for the official purposes of the Union, and the makers of the Constitution sought to afford relief to regional linguistic groups by allowing the respective State Legislatures  $[Art. 345]$  and the President  $[Art. 347]$  to recognise some language or languages other than Hindi as the languages for intra-State official transactions or any of them. These provisions thus recognise the right of the majority of the State Legislature or a substantial section of the population of a State to have the language spoken by them to be recognised for official purposes within the State.

In the result, the provisions of the Constitution relating to Official Language have come to be somewhat complicated [Arts. 343-351].

The Official language of the Union shall be Hindi in Devanagri script [Art. 343]. But, for a period of fifteen years from the **Official Language.** commencement of this Constitution, the English language shall continue to be used for all the official purposes of the Union

Parliament may by law provide for the use of-

A. Of the Union.

(a) The English language, or

(b) The Devanagri form of numerals, for such purposes as may be specified in the law [Art. 343].

In short, English would continue to be the official language of the Union side by side with Hindi, until 1965, and thereafter the use of English for any purpose will depend on Parliamentary legislation. Parliament has made this law by enacting the Official Languages Act, 1963, which will be presently noted.

The Constitution provides for the appointment of a Commission as well as a Committee of Parliament to advise the **Official Language** President as to certain matters relating to the official Commission.

language [Art. 344]. The Official Language Commission is to be appointed at the expiration of 5 years, and again at the expiration of 10 years, from the commencement of the Constitution. The President shall constitute the Commission with the representatives of the recognised languages specified in the Eighth Schedule.<sup>1</sup> It shall be the duty of the Commission to make recommendations to the President as to-

(a) the progressive use of the Hindi language for the official purposes of the Union;

(b) restrictions on the use of the English language for any of the official purposes of the Union;

(c) the language to be used for proceedings in the Supreme Court and the High Courts and the texts of legislative enactments of the Union and the States as well as subordinate legislation made thereunder;

(d) the form of numerals to be used for any of the official purposes of the Union;

(e) any other matters referred to the Commission by the President as regards-(1) the official language of the Union, and

(2) the language for communication between the Union and the States or between one State and another.

In making its recommendations, the Commission shall have due regard to the industrial, cultural and scientific advancement of India and the just claims and interests of persons belonging to the non-Hindi speaking areas in regard to Public Services.

The recommendations of the Commission will be examined by a Joint Parliamentary Committee consisting of thirty members of whom twenty shall be elected from the Lok Sabha and ten from the Rajya Sabha in accordance with the system of proportional representation by single transferable vote. The Committee will examine the recommendations of the Commission and report their opinion to the President.

**Implementation** of the Recommendations of the First **Official Language** Commission.

The Official Language Commission was, accordingly, appointed in 1955 with Sri B.G. Kher as Chairman, and it submitted its Report in 1956, which was presented to Parliament in 1957 and examined by a joint<br>Parliamentary Committee. The recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee upon a consideration of

 $\circ$ f of the Report of the Official Language Commission were as follows-

(a) The Constitution contains an integrated scheme of official language and its approach to the question is flexible and admits of appropriate adjustment being made within the framework of the scheme.

(b) Different regional languages are rapidly replacing English as a medium of instruction and of official work in the States. The use of an Indian language for the purposes of the Union has thus become a matter of practical necessity, but there need be no rigid date-line for the change-over. It should be a natural transition over a period of time effected smoothly and with the minimum of inconvenience.

c) English should be the principal official language and Hindi the subsidiary official language till 1965. After 1965, when Hindi becomes the principal official language of Union, English should continue as the subsidiary official language.

(d) No restriction should be imposed for the present on the use of English for any of the purposes of the Union and provision should be made in terms of Cl. (3) of Art. 343 for the continued use of English even after 1965 for purposes to be specified by Parliament by law as long as may be necessary.

(e) Considerable importance attaches to the provision in Art. 351 that Hindi should be so developed that it may serve as a medium of expression for all elements of the composite culture of India, and every encouragement should be given to the use of easy and simple diction.

In pursuance of the above recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee the President issued an Order<sup>2</sup> on Two **Standing** April 27, 1960, containing directions by way of Commissions. implementing the above recommendations. The main direction was as regards the evolution of Hindi terminology for scientific, administrative and legal literature and the translation of English literature on administrative and procedural matters into Hindi. For the evolution of such terminology, the Official Language Commission recommended the constitution of two Standing Commissions. (A) For the development of legal terminology and preparation of authoritative texts of Central Acts in Hindi and other languages a Commission [known as the Official Language (Legislative) Commission] was constituted in 1961. It was abolished in 1976 and its functions have been assigned to the Legislative Department of the Government of India. (B) The other Commission [known as the Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology] is working under the Ministry of Human Resources.

Of the other recommendations of the Official Language Commission, the following, inter alia, were adopted in the President's Order:2

(i) English shall continue to be the medium of examination for the recruitment through the Union Public Service Commission but, after some time, Hindi may be admitted as an alternative medium, both Hindi and English being available as the media at the option of the candidate.

## INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 33]

(ii) Parliamentary legislation may continue to be in English but an authorised translation should be provided in Hindi. For this purpose, the Ministry of Law has been directed to provide for such translation and also to initiate legislation to provide for an authorised Hindi translation of the text of Acts passed by Parliament.

(iii) Where the original text of Bills introduced or Acts passed by a State Legislature is in a language other than Hindi, a Hindi translation may be published with it besides an English translation as provided in Cl. (3) of Art. 348.

(iv) When the time comes for the change-over, Hindi shall be the language of the Supreme Court.

(v) Similarly, when the time for change-over comes, Hindi shall ordinarily be the language of judgments, decrees or orders of Courts, in all regions; but, by undertaking necessary legislation, the use of a regional official language may be made optional instead of Hindi, with the previous consent of the President.

The Constitution further provides that the language for the time being authorised for use in the Union for official purposes (i.e., English) shall be the official language of communication between one

State and another State and between a State and the Union. If, however, two or more States agree that the Hindi language should be the official language for communication between such States, that language may be used for such communication instead of English  $Art. 346.$ 

The Legislature of a State may by law<sup>3</sup> adopt any one or more of the languages in use in the State or Hindi as the language to be used for all or any of the official purposes of that State: Provided C. Of a State. that, until the Legislature of the State otherwise provides by law, the English language shall continue to be used for those official purposes within the State for which it was being used immediately before the commencement of this Constitution.

There is also a provision for the recognition of any other language for the official purposes of a State or any part thereof, upon a substantial popular demand for it being made to the President [Art. 347].

Until Parliament by law otherwise provides-

(a) all proceedings in the Supreme Court and in every High Court,

(b) the authoritative texts-

D. Language to be used<br>in the Supreme Court<br>and in the High Courts and for Acts, Bills, etc.

(i) of all Bills to be introduced or amendments thereto to be moved in either House of Parliament or in the House or either House of the Legislature of a State,

(ii) of all Acts passed by Parliament or the Legislature of a State and of all Ordinances promulgated by the President or the Governor of a State, and

(iii) of all orders, rules, regulations and bye-laws issued under this Constitution or under any law made by Parliament or the Legislature of a State,

shall be in the English language.

A State Legislature may, however, prescribe the use of any language other than English for Bills and Acts passed by itself, or subordinate legislation made thereunder. Similarly, the Governor of a State may, with the previous consent of the President, authorise the use of Hindi or any other language used for official purposes of the State, in proceedings in the High Court of the State, but not in judgments, decrees or orders (which must continue to be in English until Parliament by law otherwise provides) [Art. 348].

The foregoing provisions of the Constitution are now to be read subject to the modifications made by the Official Languages Act, 1963 and the Authorised Translations (Central Laws) Act, 1973 and the new Art. 394A, inserted in the Constitution in 1987.

In 1973, Parliament enacted the Authorised Translations (Central

Laws) Act, 1973, to provide that when a Central Law is translated into a regional language (other than Hindi), and published in the Official Gazette, under the authority of the President, such translation shall be deemed to be the authorised translation thereof in

such language.

Art. 394A.

The Draft Constitution as well as the Constitution adopted by the Constituent Assembly on the 26th November, 1949, was in the English language. After it was officially

translated into Hindi, Art. 394A was inserted into the Constitution, by the 58th Amendment Act, 1987, in order to give it effective authority. In pursuance of this Article, the President published in the Gazette of India, the Hindi text which, according to Cl. (2) of Art. 394A, shall be construed to have the same meaning as the original text in the English language, and in case of any difficulty arising in this matter, the President shall direct the Hindi text to be suitably revised.

The provisions of the Official Languages Act (as amended) are-

I. Continuance of English Language for Official Purposes of the Union and Official Languages for Use in Parliament. Notwithstanding the expiration of the period of fifteen years from the commencement Act, 1963. of the Constitution, the English language may, as from

the appointed day, continue to be used, in addition to Hindi,-

(a) for all the official purposes of the Union for which it was being used immediately before that day; and

(b) for the transaction of business in Parliament.

II. Authorised Hindi Translation of Central Acts, etc. (1) A translation in Hindi published under the authority of the President in the Official Gazette on and after the appointed day,-

[CHAP. 33 INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA

- (a) of any Central Act or of any Ordinance promulgated by the President, or
- (b) of any order, regulation or bye-law issued under the Constitution or under any Central Act,

shall be deemed to be authoritative text thereof in Hindi.

(2) As from the appointed day the authoritative text in the English language of all Bills to be introduced or amendments thereto to be moved in either House of Parliament shall be accompanied by a translation of the same in Hindi authorised in such manner as may be prescribed by rules made under this Act.

III. Authorised Hindi Translation of State Acts in Certain Cases. Where<br>the Legislature of a State has prescribed any language other than Hindi for<br>use in Acts passed by the Legislature of the State or in Ordinances<br>promul required by Cl. (3) of Art. 348 of the Constitution, may be published on or after the appointed day under the authority of the Governor of the State in the Official Gazette of that State and in such a case, the translation in Hindi of any such Act or Ordinance shall be deemed to be the authoritative text thereof in the Hindi language.

IV. Optional Use of Hindi or other Official Language in Judgments, etc., of High Courts. As from the appointed day or any day thereafter, the Governor of a State may, with the previous consent of the President, authorise the use of Hindi or the official language of the State, in addition to the English language, for the purposes of any judgment, decree or order passed or made by the High Court for that State and where any judgment, decree or order is passed or made in any such language (other than the English language), it shall be accompanied by a translation of the same in the English language issued under the authority of the High Court.

V. Inter-State Communications. (a) English shall be used for purposes of communication between the Union and a State which has not adopted Hindi as its official language. (b) Where Hindi is used for purposes of communication between one State and another which has not adopted Hindi as its official language, such communication in Hindi shall be accompanied by an English translation thereof.

The Constitution lays down certain special directives in respect of not only the official language but also the other languages **Special Directives** in use in the different parts of the country, in order to relating to Languaprotect the interests of the linguistic minorities. ges.

A. As regards the *official* language—the directive is, of course, for the promotion and development of the Hindi language so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India and this is laid down as a duty of the Union; and the Union is further directed to secure the enrichment of Hindi, by assimilating without interfering with its genius, the forms, style and expressions, used in the Hindustani and other languages (specified in the Eighth Schedule) and by

**CHAP. 33**

giving primary importance to Sanskrit in this respect Sanskrit neglected. [Art. 351]. The Government of India has already implemented this directive by taking a number of steps for the popularisation of Hindi amongst the non-Hindi speaking people, particularly its own employees.<sup>4</sup> But not enough has been done for the promotion of Sanskrit so as "to secure the enrichment of Hindi by drawing on Sanskrit", which the State is enjoined to do, by Art. 351. The views of the Author regarding importance of Sanskrit have been supported by the Supreme Court.<sup>5</sup> The Court has clearly spelt out that in view of the importance of Sanskrit for nurturing our cultural heritage it is necessary to include it as an elective subject at the secondary school level. The Education Minister of the Charan Singh Government promised to set up a Sanskrit Academy, but that Government did not survive to implement it.<sup>6</sup>

On the other hand, an Urdu Academy has been set up in West Bengal, at Government expense, on October 27, 1979. There cannot be any objection from any enlightened man to any effort for the promotion of any Indian language, at least any of those specified in the 8th Schedule. But there is a constitutional aspect which does not appear to have been duly

Violation of Arts. 27, 351.

considered by the authorities. If the newspaper reports be correct, one of the objectives of this Academy is to translate religious scriptures like the Quoran, at the

expense of the Academy.<sup>7</sup> If the resources of the Academy be the public revenues, raised by taxation, any appropriation of such resources for the promotion or maintenance of any 'particular religion' shall be hit by Art. 27. The reason behind Art. 27 is that India is a 'secular State' where all religions are on a status of equality so far as the State is concerned. If the contrary be permissible some other State Government may set up a language Academy for the translation and dissemination of the scriptures of the Hindus like the Vedas, Bhagavad-Gita, while another Government may take up the translation and propagation of the Bible and so on, resulting in conflicts between the different religions under the auspices of the State.

If the State really wants to promote the languages at Government expenses, the only constitutional way would be to set up an Academy of languages, embracing all the languages in the 8th Schedule, so that Sanskrit, Urdu, Bengali, etc., would have an equal treatment, and all religious activities should be excluded from the programme of such an Academy, because there being numerous religions in India, there is a likelihood of some religion being excluded in the venture, leading to a violation of Art. 27.8

As regards research into the Sanskrit language for enriching the vocabulary of Hindi [Art. 351], a branch should be opened specifically for this purpose and, if any activities are already being undertaken, they should be speeded up and the glossaries produced should be available to the people at a low cost. The extension of such an organisation itself will provide employment to Sanskrit scholars and thus provide incentive to the otherwise unprofitable study of Sanskrit.

B. For the protection of the *other* languages in use, the following directives are providedINTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 33

(i) For the submission of representation for the redress of any grievance to any officer or authority of the Union or a State, the petitioner is authorised to use any of the languages used in the Union or in the State, as the case may be [Art. 350]. In other words, a representation cannot be rejected on the ground that it is not in Hindi.

(ii) Every State and other local authority within a State is directed to provide adequate facilities for instruction in the mother-tongue at the preliminary stage of education to children belonging to linguistic minority groups and the President is authorised to issue such directions to any State as he may consider necessary for the securing of such facilities [Art. 350A].

(iii) A Special Officer for linguistic minorities shall be appointed by the President to investigate all matters relating to the safeguards provided by the Constitution for linguistic minorities and to report to the President upon those matters. It shall be the duty of the President to cause all such reports to be laid before each House of Parliament and also to be sent to the Government of the State concerned [Art. 350B].
