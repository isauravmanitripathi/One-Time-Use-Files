# **CHAPTER 19 MUNICIPALITIES AND PLANNING COMMITTEES**

PART IXA which has come into force on 1-6-1993 gives a constitutional foundation to the local self-government units in urban areas. In fact such institutions are in existence all over the country.

Some of the provisions are similar to those contained in Part IX,  $e.g.$ Reservation of Seats, Finance Commission, Election Commission etc.

This part gives birth to two types of bodies:

(i) Institutions of self-government [Art. 243Q], and

(ii) Institutions for planning [Arts. 243ZX and 243 ZE].

Institutions of self-government, called by a general name "municipalities" are of three types:

(a) Nagar Panchayat, for a transitional area, i.e. an area which is being transformed from a rural area to an urban area.

(b) Municipal Council for a smaller urban area.

(c) Municipal Corporation for a larger urban area.

Article 243Q makes it obligatory for every State to constitute such units. But if there is an urban area or part of it where municipal services are being provided or proposed to be provided by an industrial establishment in that area then considering also the size of the area and other factors the Governor may specify it to be an industrial township. For such an area it is not mandatory to constitute a Municipality.

The members of a municipality would generally be elected by direct election. The Legislature of a State may by law of

provide for representation in a municipality of (i)

persons having special knowledge or experience in municipal administration, (ii) Members of Lok Sabha, State Assembly, Rajya Sabha and Legislative Council, and (iii) the Chairpersons of Committees constituted under Cl. (5) of Art. 243S. The Chairperson shall be elected in the manner provided by the Legislature.

Wards Committee.

For one or more wards comprised within the territorial area of a municipality having a population of three lacs or more

it would be obligatory to constitute Ward Committees. The State Legislature shall make provision with respect to its composition, territorial area and the manner in which the seats in a ward committee shall be filled.

of **Reservations** seats for Scheduled **Castes** and **Scheduled Tribes.**

It is permissible for a State Legislature to make provisions for reservation of seats or offices of Chairpersons in favour of backward classes.

Elections to constitute a Municipality shall be completed before the expiry of the period of five years. If the Municipality has been superseded before the expiry of its term, the elections must be completed within six months of its dissolution. A Municipality constituted after its dissolution shall continue only for the remainder of the term. But if the remainder of the period is less than six months it shall not be necessary to hold elections.

It has been provided that no amendment of the law in force shall cause dissolution of a Municipality before the expiry of the five years term.

Article 243V lays down that all persons who are qualified to be chosen
