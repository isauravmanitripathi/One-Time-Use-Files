## HOW THE CONSTITUTION **HAS WORKED**

I. ONE who has to study the Indian Constitution today may come to grief if he has in his hand only a text of the Constitution as it was promulgated in November, 1949, for, momentous changes have since been introduced not only by numerous Amendment Acts but by scores of judicial decisions emanating from the highest tribunal of the land. Nearly every provision of the original Constitution has acquired a gloss either from formal amendment or from judicial interpretation, and an account of the working of the Constitution, over and above this, would in itself be a formidable one.

At the first instance, the passing of ninety four Amendment Acts (see Multiple Amend- Table IV, post) in a period of fifty nine years can ments of the hardly be passed over unnoticed. In the American Constitution, the process of formal amendment<br>prescribed by the Constitution to changes in social Constitution.

conditions has fallen into the hands of the Judiciary even though it ostensibly exercises the function only of interpreting the Constitution. Instead of leaving the matter to the slow machinery of judicial interpretation, our Constitution has vested the power in the people's representatives and, though the final power of *interpretation* of the Constitution as it stands at any moment belongs to the Courts, the power of changing the instrument itself has been given to Parliament (with or without ratification by the State Legislatures) and, if Parliament, acting as the constituent body, considers that the interests of the country so require, it can amend the Constitution as often as it likes. The ease with which these Amendments have been enacted demonstrates that our Constitution contains the potentiality of peacefully adopting changes some of which would be considered as revolutionary in other countries.

The real question involved in this context is whether it is the Judiciary or a constituent body which should be entrusted with this task of introducing changes in order to keep pace with the exigencies of national and social progress. For reasons good or bad, the framers of our Constitution preferred the Legislature as the machinery for introducing changes into the Constitution, but the need for change is acknowledged even in countries like<br>the U.S.A. where the task has been assumed by the Judiciary, taking<br>advantage of the fact that the amending machinery provided in the Constitution was too heavy and unwieldy for practical purposes.

A little reflection will show that some of these changes, the need for which must be admitted even by critics, could not have been introduced by

the Courts, by the application of the canons of statutory interpretation which are firmly embedded in our Courts. An instance to the point is the insertion of the word 'reasonable' to qualify the word 'restrictions' in Cl. (2) of Art. 19 (by the First Amendment). Without such a qualification, the engine of judicial review would have been altogether excluded from the field of legislative encroachment upon the freedom of expression, for, it was not open to any Court, unless it was determined to do violence to the canons of interpretation, to supply the word 'reasonable' which had been inserted by the makers of the Constitution in all other Clauses of the Article but omitted from Cl. (2). The Seventh Amendment, again, was necessary to provide for the territorial reorganisation of the country which could not be made by the makers of the Constitution, before promulgating it in 1949. Similarly, the Tenth, Twelfth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Thirty-fifth, Thirty-sixth, and many other Amendments have been necessitated by the acquisition of new territories or the upliftment of the political status of existing territories, which are obviously for the benefit of the nation.

At the same time, one cannot help observing that so frequent and multifarious amendments of the Constitution, some of which might have been avoided or consolidated, have undermined the sanctity of the Constitution as an organic instrument.

Vital changes made by the 42nd to 44th Amendments.

416

Special mention should, however, be made of the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976, by which Congress Government, taking advantage of its monolithic control over the Union as well as the State Legislatures, effected comprehensive changes in the Constitution, overturning some of its bedrocks.<sup>1</sup> So widespread and drastic was the impact

of this Amendment Act that it would be proper to call it an Act for 'revision', rather than 'amendment' of the Constitution.

As a result of popular resentment against such drastic changes, the Janata Party was voted to power at the general election which was held as a result of dissolution of the Lok Sabha at the instance of Mrs. Gandhi early in 1977. After several reverses, owing to their lacking a 2/3 majority in the Rajya Sabha, the Janata Government succeeded in enacting the 43rd and 44th Amendment Acts (1977, 1978), which wiped out many of the new provisions introduced by the 42nd Amendment Act, restoring the pre-1976 text of the Constitution, on many points. But the total elimination of the right to property from the Part on Fundamental Rights is an additional contribution of the Janata Government, which is bound to have far-reaching effects.

But in view of the mutilation of the Constitution so far made by endless

A case for revision  $of$ the Constitution, instead of piecemeal amendments.

piecemeal amendments, inevitably resulting in confusion and inflicting injury upon the dignity and solemnity of the Constitution, an impartial observer may suggest that a Commission for the revision of the Constitution should be set up to examine, objectively, each of the existing provisions in the light of

suggestions for amendment from the Government as well as the citizens and to recommend the enactment of one comprehensive Amendment Act or a revision of the Constitution itself. In a country like the United States where the written Constitution is sanctified as the Bible of the Nation, nobody could imagine that a Government, because it commands unquestionable majority in the Legislature, should amend the Constitution as often demanded by its Departments or in the manner recommended by the political Committees of the Party in power, as has happened in the case of the 42nd, 43rd and 44th Amendments in India.

In case the Government ever accepts the Author's suggestion to revise the Constitution,<sup>2</sup> the further suggestion is that the Constitution should be amplified, by inserting in it provisions relating to matters on which it is silent, or it is left to conventions or the goodwill of those who are to administer those matters respectively,-because in the absence of such codified provisions, much confusion has arisen not only amongst the masses who have little knowledge about the British conventions of Cabinet Government or the common law privileges of the British Parliament, but amongst the administrators themselves. Though many such instances may be found upon a thorough examination, I shall illustrate my point with reference to these two instances.

A. Though the Cabinet system of government was adopted by the framers of the Indian Constitution both at the Union To codify: and State (subject to the discretionary sphere left to A. Conventions. the State Governor) levels, the British Cabinet system

is a complicated outcome of history and the sagacity of trained politicians and even then, as veteran scholars have pointed out, it is a difficult task to formulate clear-cut propositions, relating to the conventions upon which the system is founded. Naturally, in India, there has been much controversy both at the Centre and the States to what course should be taken by the President or the Governor in the matter of selecting a person to form a government in a situation where no party commands a clear majority; conversely, what action should be taken by the constitutional head of the State where it is alleged against a party in power that it has lost majority in the popular House of the Legislature by reason of defection or the like; whether the constitutional head has the power to dismiss the Prime Minister or Chief Minister, i.e., the Council of Ministers collectively, and, if so, when. Though there is scope for controversy on such questions, it is not wholesome for the country if the Governors of two States or the President of the Union take divergent steps in the same or similar situation. Questions relating to the exercise of the pardoning or Ordinance-making powers have also created confusion. Even though it may not be possible to make<br>comprehensive provisions relating to such matters or to apprehend all<br>possible situations of doubt or controversy, it would be possible and<br>profitable to f down by the Supreme Court or on which there has been a fair amount of consensus amongst the political parties as a result of the working of the Constitution for about fifty nine years.

B. When the Constitution was drafted in 1948-49, the uncodified of privileges of the British House of Commons were

sanctified by the Indian Constitution, but only as a temporary measure, because it was not practicable, at

once, to grapple with the difficult problem of codifying the mass of British precedents which constitute the foundation of privileges of Parliament in

England. But almost six decades have passed since then, and today, even if the task of a fairly exhaustive codification may not be completed all at once, many of the principles have been settled by judicial decisions of the highest Court and the consensus of precedents laid down by the Presiding Officers of the Houses of the Union and State Legislatures. It is not conducive to a smooth working of the Parliamentary system in this poor and developing country to have a war between the Courts and the Legislatures as has happened on occasions,<sup>3</sup>—a repetition of which can be averted only by a proper solution embodied in the Constitution itself. Those who still argue in favour of a 'High Court of Parliament', exercising powers and privileges, such as the British House of Commons, are blinded by the initial fallacy that we have a written Constitution which limits the powers of all the organs of the State, including the Legislatures and that the latter cannot claim any overriding power (in the name of privileges) to interfere with the jurisdictions vested in the superior Courts by Arts. 32 and 226 of the Constitution itself. The Constitution-amending body can no longer fight shy of facing this unfortunate and uncanny problem of which there cannot be any authoritative solution so long as the Constitution itself is not amended, to incorporate that solution which is acceptable to the special majority of the constituent body. Even if the code of privileges be not exhaustive it is better to start with a nucleus rather than a vacuum.

II. Of the achievements of the Executive and the Legislature in the working of the Constitution, one cannot fail to refer to Implementation of the progress made in implementation of the Directive the **Directive** Principles of State Policy, which shows that the Principles.

Government in power has not taken them as 'pious homilies', as was apprehended by critics when they were engrafted into the Constitution. Though the implementation of these Directives falls mostly within the province of the States, the Union has offered its guidance and assistance through the Planning Commission. The Constitution of India, it should be remembered, was not intended to serve merely as a charter of government but as a means to achieve the social and economic transformation of the country peacefully and this goal has been achieved to the extent that the Government has succeeded in implementing the Directive Principles.

By the insertion of Art. 31C by the Constitution (25th Amendment) Act, 1971, the Congress Government demonstrated that it was determined to implement the directives and that if the Fundamental Rights came in the way, it would not hesitate to amend even the Fundamental Rights. The Supreme Court has also adhered to this view,<sup>4</sup> though in its earlier decisions, it had imputed pre-eminence to the Fundamental Rights.

The greatest failure of the Government in implementing the Directives has been with respect to the enactment of a uniform civil code [Art. 44], which we shall presently see.

In enforcing the Directive for Prohibition of consumption of intoxicants, too, some Governments are giving more importance to revenue than the 'fundamental principle of governance' embodied in Art. 47. That is why it has not been substantially implemented in the course of almost six  $C<sub>F</sub>$ de

III. In the federal sphere, it may be stated that most of the formal and informal changes which have taken place since the Trend towards the commencement of the Constitution have been to Unitary System. strengthen Central control over the States more and

more. While the federal system, by its nature, has generated State consciousness more than under the British regime, the Centre has been endeavouring more and more to assume control over the States not only by Constitutional amendment (Chap. 5, ante) and legislation but also by setting up extra-Constitutional bodies like the Planning Commission,<sup>5</sup> the National Development Council,<sup>6</sup> and numerous Conferences. As regards the predominant position of the Planning Commission, a learned author<sup>7</sup>observed-

"The emergence of the Planning Commission as a super-government has disturbed the concept of the autonomy of the States. It has also impinged on the authority of the States in matters vital to its administration such as education, health and other welfare services."

The Government have, since July, 1967, reorganised the Planning Commission,<sup>8</sup> with changes in its status and functions (as recommended by the Administrative Reforms Commission), constituted by whole-time members (and headed by the Prime Minister,<sup>5</sup> as before), as a result of which the Commission will cease to have any executive functions and will confine itself to the formulation of plans and the evaluation of their performance.

No less momentous is the increasing dependence of the States upon the Union in the matter of finance. Not only is the financial strength of a State dependent upon the share of the taxes and grants-in-aid as may be allotted to it by the union upon the recommendations of the Finance Commission, there is a general sense of irresponsibility in financial matters in the States founded upon the assumption that the Union will ultimately come to its aid or, else, the National Plan will fail.

But, notwithstanding this unitary trend, federation has not yet proved to be a failure in India, particularly because the Supreme Court has steadfastly enforced the distribution of powers laid down in the Constitution,<sup>9</sup> without acknowledging any pre-eminence of the Union so as to obliterate that federal distribution, except in solitary instances so far.<sup>10</sup>

The trend towards greater cohesion is, in fact, an index not of the failure but of the success of the federal system of India. One of the defects of a federation, according to classical writers, is its weakness. Credit must go to India if she succeeds in attaining unitary strength upon the foundation of a federal governmental system over an unwieldy territory inhabited by heterogeneous elements with radically conflicting ideologies. The founders of our Constitution had realised that a federal system was the only system suitable to a country like ours, consisting of so many heterogeneous elements. But, in view of our external dangers, existing and potential, they sought to impart into the federal system the elements of adjustment by resorting to which the system might acquire the strength of a unitary system in case of external aggression or other extraordinary circumstances. That it has succeeded in attaining this objectiv<sup>all</sup> has been demonstrated by the

#### **INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA** [CHAP. 34]

working of our governmental system since the ominous aggression which had been set in motion by China in October, 1962 and is still being driven hard by the China-Pakistan axis, even after the debacle of Yahya Khan's Army in Bangladesh in 1971.<sup>12</sup> The situation on India's borders was made more serious and alarming by subsequent events such as the fall of the friendly government of Mujibur Rehman in Bangladesh,<sup>12</sup> the importation of Soviet Forces in Afghanistan together with the countervailing move of the United States to arm Pakistan with the most sophisticated weapons which could very well be used against India, as had happened in the past; and at the back of all this, loomed the nightmare of the 'Islamic bomb', backed by American bases within Pakistan.<sup>13</sup>

IV. Unfortunate happenings in the Punjab, Kashmir and Assam have demonstrated that strong Central control is needed in India if not only federalism but the very existence of the Union of **Separatist** forces India is to be saved from separatist forces fighting for at work. fragmentation and aggressive provincialism, which, if

undeterred, would undermine that national unity and integrity which forms the foundation-stone of the Constitution.

communities,<sup>15</sup> leading to the break-up of India as a nation. Though Anandpur Saheb resolution,<sup>16</sup> which the Akalis intended to impose upon the Union by force<sup>17</sup> did not itself speak of secession from the Union or to start an independent State of Khalisthan that was at the back of the movement, as evidenced by extraneous evidence.<sup>18</sup> Apart from that, the demand that, after the formation of a compact State with adjoining Sikh majority territories, the Union would have jurisdiction over that State only with respect to five subjects, viz., Defence, External Affairs, Posts and Telegraphs, Currency and Railway, put their case even higher than that of Jammu & Kashmir. For, while practically the whole of the Union List (List I of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution) and a good number of items of the Concurrent List (List III) now extend to the State of Jammu & Kashmir, the Anandpur resolution would have ousted the jurisdiction of the Union over the entire Concurrent List, and a substantial portion of the Union List, e.g., those relating to communications other than Railways, Posts and Telegraphs, Banking, Insurance, Public Debt of the Union, Reserve Bank of India, Trade and Commerce with foreign countries, regulation of national industries, inter-State waterways, institutions of higher education, Elections to Parliament, Supreme Court and High Courts, Union taxation, and the like. The Akalis could not claim inspiration from the instance of Jammu & Kashmir, because while the latter State has a history of its own, with international implications, Punjab had all along been an integral Province of India and, further, the Akalis did not constitute the entire Sikh population of Punjab,-the other Sikhs did not support the Akali demand; nay, they failed to win over the Sikh President of India or even the Sikh Chief Minister of the State of Punjab. On the other hand, within the Akali Party, sprang up several leaders and in May, 1985, the leaders gave way to terrorists, led by the father of the Khalistan demand, Sant Bhindranwale.<sup>19</sup>

## HOW THE CONSTITUTION HAS WORKED **CHAP. 34]**

Subsequent to the preceding events in July, 1985 (after the accession of Sri Rajiv Gandhi as Prime Minister), a momentous event took place, namely, that an agreement (called the 'Punjab Accord')<sup>20</sup> was entered into between the Prime Minister of India and Sant Longowal,—the head of the predominant group amongst the Akalis. According to this Accord, inter alia, the Anandpur Resolution was to be referred to the Sarkaria Commission and some Hindi-speaking areas of Punjab were to be transferred to Haryana in lieu of Chandigarh which would come over to Punjab from Haryana.

The Punjab Accord, however, failed to make any settlement of the Punjab problem (upto July, 1992) for the following reasons-

(a) The Chief Minister (Surjeet Singh Barnala) failed to submit the State Government's case to the Sarkaria Commission.

(b) The Commission appointed to find out the Hindi-speaking areas of Punjab which were to be given over to Haryana in lieu of Chandigarh failed to complete its work owing to repeated objections of various sorts being raised by the Punjab Government.

(c) The Mann Group, elected to Parliament in November, 1989, raised new demands every day thus deferring any amicable settlement with the National Front Government which was ready for a talk.

(d) Terrorism was continuing unabated and each morning's newspaper reports some dozen murders, bank loot, and the like.  $^{21}$ 

In deference to the opposition to any further extension of President's Rule (which had been in posed in 1987), election was held in Punjab in February, 1992, at which Congress (I) formed Government with Mr. Beant Singh as the Chief Minister. It seemed that as a result of unabated Police action in Punjab, the terrorists had left Punjab but dispersed throughout India, from Uttar Pradesh to Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal.

B. The case of the agitators in Assam is peculiar. They do not demand secession, but they want 'Assam for Assamese'.<sup>22</sup> The Assamese. Though at the beginning, their demand was mystified by the intervention of political parties, the massacre of hundreds of Bengalis,-Hindus and Muslims,-developments since January, 1983 leave no doubt that the agitators are determined to purge Assam of all people who are not of Assamese origin. These non-Assamese, however, consist of different categories:

(a) In so far as the citizens of other States, such as West Bengal or Bihar, are concerned, who have settled in Assam for purposes of profession or business, the agitators must remember that these citizens of India have a fundamental right to reside and settle in 'any part of the territory of India', under Art. 19(1)(e). To oust them from the State of Assam by violence would be to give a decent burial to the Constitution, and if Assam is allowed to succeed, other States would most likely follow, breaking federal India into pieces.

The first task of the Government and the agitators should, therefore, be to identify these 'citizens of India', i.e., those who have acquired citizenship of India under Art. 5 or 6 of the Constitution or under the provisions of the Utizenship Act, 1955. These people are not 'foreign nationals'. They can be found out only through some peaceful machinery and not force.<sup>23-24</sup>

(b) On the other hand, there are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan); they are, in fact, 'foreign nationals'. The

### INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA $[CHAP. 34]$

Government of India, however, contends that it has got its obligations under an international agreement, so that they cannot be driven back to Bangladesh; but even then, the Government of India can raise the problem with Bangladesh diplomatically or before some international forum, the details of which cannot be discussed in this book. The humanitarian ground raised by the Government of India in favour of the illegal immigrants condemns the Government itself for its dilatory policy. Even apart from Assam, lacs of Muslim immigrants and the 'long marchers' from Bangladesh<br>are constantly infiltrating into West Bengal and are being sheltered by the<br>Muslims in the bordering territories of West Bengal, and in course of a f by the evidence of ration cards, electoral roll, etc.,<sup>25</sup> in the same manner as in Assam, if years pass on without any firm action being taken against such infiltration from another 'foreign' State,—as would never be tolerated (at such mass scale) by any independent State (other than India) in the world.

The problem of<br>infiltration from Bangladesh.

Not only the security of India but the entire social and political structure of India has been threatened by the mass infiltration of Bangladeshis into the border States of Assam and West Bengal.

The question involved is not communal but legal, namely that of sovereignty. No independent State, other than India, would welcome infiltrators from another State. As early as 1964-65, cases brought before the Calcutta High Court clearly demonstrated that large number of immigrants had overstayed after expiry of their visas, with the support of their kinsmen or friends in the bordering districts of West Bengal. In pursuance of the judgments passed in these cases, the Police pushed back many of these immigrants into Bangladesh, but the operation was stalled by the utterance of a Chief Minister of Bengal that he himself was neither a Hindu nor a Muslim, and that he would view the problem of illegal immigration or infiltration as a humanitarian problem caused by a shortage of food or employment in Bangladesh.<sup>26</sup>

The Government of India also shut their eyes to the problem even when some leaders in Bangladesh threatened to conduct a 'long march' of Pakistani nationals through India or even when the infiltrants demanded Indian citizenship at a mammoth gathering at the Calcutta Press Club under the nose of the Police.<sup>27</sup> They were roused to their senses only when the infiltrators reached the capital city of Delhi (as did Bahadur Shah Zafar!), and when they are demanding Indian citizenship on the strength of their Ration Cards and entries in the electoral roll,<sup>28</sup> and forming Muslim pockets<sup>29</sup> which would lead to a demand for their autonomy.

It is a pity that the same Central Government who had earlier overlooked the illegal immigration as a human problem has now held it to be a serious threat to the integrity of India<sup>29</sup> at a conference of Chief Ministers called by the Centre, and the same Party in West Bengal which h the modus operandi adopted and the seriousness of the problems created by them. $29$ 

Apart from anything else, infiltration has thus come to operate as a divisive force threatening the integrity of India, which can be rooted only by

422
firmly carrying out a plan of action after realising the gravity of the situation, instead of using the illegal infiltrants as pawns in the game of vote-hunting.

Another such division factor is that the people having a separate lan-

guage must have a separate political status and auto-Language as nomy. The initial blunder of the Government in this separatist force. behalf was committed when the States were reorga-

nised on a primarily linguistic basis and that current is still unimpeded, thus raising the original number of States in Parts A-B (18) to 28, in 2000, and the scramble for Gorkhaland, Bodoland, Jharkhand, Uttarkhand and the like is continuing at different levels<sup>30</sup> [Jharkhand and Uttaranchal (Uttarakhand) have been created as new States by carving their territories out of the territories of the Bihar and the Uttar Pradesh in 2000. Besides Chhattisgarh, as a new State, has been created by carving it out of the territory of Madhya Pradesh in 2000. (see Table III)]. To concede any form of separate status, such as the formation of a Union Territory, ultimately leads to the d for full-fledged Statehood.

A formidable corollary from the linguistic demand is the struggle for getting one's language included in the 8th Schedule of the Constitution. Obviously, there is little material gain from such inclusion. The only two relevant provisions of the Constitution are Arts. 344(1) and 351. The former gives the people representing a language specified in the 8th Schedule to have a member in the Official Language Commission and the latter gives that language to be considered for contribution towards the development of the Hindi language. The real motive behind the struggle for inclusion of a particular language, therefore, is *political*, namely, to lay the corner-stone for demanding a separate political entity for the people speaking that language, as in the case of Gorkhaland.<sup>30</sup> Be that as it may, the demand for every language to be included in the 8th Schedule is wild because there are as many as 1652 languages in India (vide Table I). Hence, there must be standard according to which the status of the 8th Schedule may be conferred on a language. Unfortunately, there is no such standard laid down in the Constitution itself and that is opening an avenue for diverse factions to raise demands which, if conceded, would lead to a suicidal fragmentation of the Union. Outside the Constitution, of course, there is an understanding that only languages which are spoken by over one lakh of people are entitled to enter into the 8th Schedule (Table I). But this understanding is too feeble to resist indiscriminate claims from any faction which may gather force enough to intimidate the Government.

It is lamentable that notwithstanding the foregoing warning offered by the Author in the 13th Edition of his Introduction to the Constitution of India, Government of India failed to amend the Constitution to lay down any definite standard for inclusion in the 8th Sch. and, instead, they have been obliged to amend the 8th Sch. itself<sup>31</sup> to include three new languages, viz., Konkani, Manipuri and Nepali, because of the time being, their demand became irresistible. But even then the case for the elevation of other languages continues unabated. Curiously, Mr. Ghising is not contented with the inclusion of Nepali alone; he wants additional entry for Gorkhali, contending that it is a language separate from Nepali which is for all residents of Nepal, apart from the Gorkhas.

A more striking event is the formation of a new Party styled All-India Urdu Morcha, 32 with the manifesto that if they are returned at the ensuing election they would instal Urdu as the second Official Language. Mere inclusion of Urdu in the 8th Sch. is not enough for them. This illustrates the political significance of the language agitation as a separatist force.

As to the working of the federal system, there is very little doubt that the allocation of the financial resources to the States by the Constitution of

Financial inadequacy States.

in

1949 has proved to be cramping for carrying out the legitimate functions of the States, however narrow they might be. After the general election in 1980, the party in power at the centre was not in control of all the

States. Different parties subscribing to different ideologies are in power in various states; these parties have been demanding revision of financial provisions of the Constitution. The Union shall have to sit with the States politically, to ascertain how much of revision of the financial provisions would satisfy the demands of the States which seek greater autonomy, 33 consonant with national security, and then to implement the findings, so that the unity and strength of the Nation may not be undermined by the Union-State carriage being driven to two opposite directions. In such a situation prudence is called for on the part of both the Union and the States. Either party must not forget that the basis of a federal system is the maintenance of what *Dicey* called the 'federal sentiment'. To be precise, the Government of India must realise that they cannot do without the States and that the strength of India lies in the strength of the border States, in particular. On the other hand, West Bengal or Jammu & Kashmir can hardly forget that they cannot maintain their political entity without the protection of the Union against powerful foreign aggression. It is suicidal for federalism if the States ruled by Opposition Parties consider the Union Government as their foe or 'rival' $^{34}$  and go on carrying on a campaign of vilification. Nevertheless, there is much truth in the contention of these States that their so-called autonomy would be hollow without a larger financial freedom. A revision<sup>34</sup> of the provisions of the Constitution relating to this matter should be undertaken as soon as the Government gathers the strength to carry such vital amendment of the Constitution.

What is more important is that there should be a greater emphasis on consultation with and consent of the States in areas affecting them vitally but not affecting the integrity of the Union, so as to establish a truly 'co-operative federalism' in India.

V. The most remarkable achievement in post-Judicial Review. Constitution India is the exercise of the power of judicial review by the superior Courts. So long as this power is wielded by the Courts effectively and fearlessly, democracy will remain ensured in India and, with all its shortcomings, the Constitution will survive. The numerous applications for the constitutional writs before the High Courts and the Supreme Court and their results testify to the establishment in India of 'limited Government', or, 'the Government of laws, not of men', as they call it in the United States of America. The Supreme Court has well performed its task of protecting the rights of the individual against the Executive, against oppressive legislation and even against the Legislature itself, when it

#### **CHAP. 34]** HOW THE CONSTITUTION HAS WORKED

becomes over-zealous in asserting its privileges not only against the individual but even against the Judges.<sup>35</sup>

At the same time, it should be observed that neither the guarantee of Fundamental Rights nor its adjunct,—Judicial Review,—could have full play<br>during the first quarter of a century of the working of our Constitution owing to their erosion by Proclamations of Emergency over a substantial period of time.

The period of 15 years, when Arts. 14, 19, 21 and 22 remained suspended owing to the operation of Art. 358 and of Orders under Art. 359, can hardly be overlooked. It is true that the Emergency provisions are as much a part of the Constitution of India as any other, and that history has proved the need for such powers to meet extraordinary situations, but, broadly speaking, if the application of the Emergency provisions overshadows the other features of the Constitution, the balance between the 'normal' and the 'emergency' provisions is palpably destroyed. Of course, the Janata Government has hemmed in the Emergency provisions in Arts. 352 and 356, by giving a larger control to Parliament over the exercise of such power, under the 44th Amendment Act, 1978. Nevertheless, even apart from Emergency, there has been an astounding erosion of Fundamental Rights owing to multiple amendments of the Constitution.

As I pointed out in the previous Editions, the means to prevent any such conflict between competing interests is to process all proposals for constitutional amendment through an expert and objective machinery, which would ensure the progressive adaptation of the Constitution to the Copernican changes in the social, economic and political background, apart from the views of the political supporters of the Party in power and the bureaucrats.<sup>36</sup> This purpose would not be served by Sarkaria Commission, which was confined to 'Centre-State Relations'.

It can be served only by setting up a Commission for the comprehensive revision of the Constitution which has also been A case for revision mutilated by multiple amendments during more than of the Constihalf century of its working, as mentioned at the outset

tution. of this Chapter. Any piecemeal reference to the existing Law Commission, with respect to particular provisions of the Constitution will only aggravate the anomaly.

Even though the power of formal amendment has been conferred upon Parliament by Art. 368 of the Constitution and the The role of the scope of resorting to the Judiciary to introduce<br>changes has been reduced by making the process of<br>amendment easier than in the U.S.A., the working of judiciary under our Constitution.

our Constitution has opened the avenue for judicial review in India in nearly the same way as in the U.S.A.

Paradoxically, the urge for judicial intervention has arisen from the very tendency of the Legislature to make frequent amendments to the Constitution, which were eating into the vitals of the Constitution (which the Supreme Court called its 'basic features'). Hence, asserted the Court, it could set aside even an Act to amend the Constitution, not only on (i) a procedural ground, viz., that the procedure laid down in Art. 368 has not

been complied by the relevant Bill, but on (ii) the *substantive* ground, viz., that the amending Act has violated one or other of the basic features of the Constitution.<sup>37</sup>

Conversely, it has come to be held that if the Legislature is not prompt enough to implement the provisions of the Constitution, the Court has the duty to make the changes necessary to adopt the demands of a progressive society.<sup>38</sup> In this mission, the Court has propounded two doctrines-

(a) The Court is the exclusive and final interpreter of all provisions of the Constitution.<sup>37</sup>

(b) The Court has the duty to make the ideals enshrined in the Constitution a reality,<sup>39</sup> and to meet the needs of social change in a welfare society.<sup>38</sup>

(c) This duty would extend even to the implementation of the 'Directive Principles' in Part IV, which were 'not enforceable by any Court' according to the Constitution itself [Art. 37].  $^{40}$ 

If a rose has its thorns, so must Judicial Review-the flower of Indian constitutionalism,-has its thorns, as has been Novel trends in demonstrated by the fact that, during the last decade Judicial Review: our Supreme Court has been evolving novel doctrines,<br>such as that of 'basic structure' or 'basic features' or Judicial activism.

In the present context, suffice it to point out that if this trend is not curbed, it would lead to unwholesome consequences, however well-intentioned the authors of such judicial innovations might be; for instance-

(a) It would add to the confusion and uncertainty, which has been introduced by the multiple amendments made by the Legislature, to the dismay not only of the general public but also of the administrators and the courts themselves, in applying the written Constitution,—the very object of which is to infuse certainty and order into the political system.

(b) It would engender bitterness between the Legislature and the Judiciary, if either of them seeks to checkmate the other,<sup>41</sup>-by means of amendment or judicial activism.

There is no knowing how far such novel doctrines may be extended, for, the final say, in the matter, rests with the Supreme Court itself. The result would be an amendment of the Constitution by the Judiciary, while Art. 368 of the Constitution specifically places the power of amendment in the legislative machinery.<sup>42</sup>

minorities. the most grievous feature of this post-Independence development is that the Minorities have held up their vote as a bait and political leaders of the majority community belonging to different parties have indiscriminately swallowed that bait in their Election Manifestos and alliances, irrespective of the *ideologies* which ushered in the Independence of India and which form the bed-rock of the existing Constitution. In this background, it is the duty of an impartial academician to point out to a nationalist Indian (every Indian citizen cannot be assumed to have narrow political ambitions) that to accept such anti-nationalist demands of the Minorities (which, though sponsored by the Muslims, are being reiterated by the other minorities, such as the Christians, the Sikhs, the Buddhists, in so far as such demands would serve their respective communal or sectional interests) would be to tear India into pieces, with a second Pakistan for Muslim-majority areas<sup>43</sup> or a Christendom for the Christians;<sup>44</sup> or, an Islamic Republic<sup>43</sup> for the Muslims, or a Khalistan, so far as the Sikhs are concerned, or a Buddhist Republic so far as the Buddhists are concerned, and so on.

It is a matter of regret and concern that the manifestos of Congress (I) and the Janata Dal for the 1991 elections promised reservations for the minorities in government service and the Armed forces. The formation of Muslim Majority districts in Kerala and Bihar is another step furthering separatism.

Space would not permit a full treatment of all the demands hoisted by the religious minorities and for a fuller treatment, the reader should read the Author's Commentary on the Constitution of India, 6th Ed., Volume D, pp. 217-28; 232-37, where, though published early in 1978, these dangerous minority ideologies had been anticipated. The broader propositions involved may, however, be mentioned for the consideration of the average reader:

A. The major demand of the Muslim minority community now is for a proportional representation in the Legislatures and in the Services, according to their number.<sup>45</sup>

This is, in fact, a resurrection of that baneful plant of the 'communal award' which had been inserted into the Indian body politic by the British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald and which had its inevitable culmination in the bloody Partition of India.

It is to prevent any repetition of such anti-national cleavages that the framers of the Constitution of free India proclaimed the Unity of the Nation to be the objective, in its Preamble, abolishing any reservation or representation on the basis of the religious colour of any individual or community; and such reservation, if made now, would violate the guarantee of equality in Arts.  $15(1)$  and  $16(1)-(2)$ , as explained by the Supreme Court.<sup>46-47</sup> Of course, all these guarantees acknowledge the constitutionality of reservation or other special provisions in the interests of the 'backward classes', so that any community which is socially or educationally backward may be entitled to special consideration under the existing Constitution [Art. 15(4)], irrespective of its religious complexion. But that would not satisfy the Muslim or Christian minorities today. They want reservation for a man because he is a Muslim or a Christian, even if he be affluent; but to

make any special provision for such a person would be a discrimination against the majority-violating the rights of equality guaranteed by Arts. 15-

To accede to these patently anti-national demands would need multiple amendments of the Constitution involving a decent burial of the doctrines of equality which the Supreme Court has built up<sup>46</sup> during nearly more than half a century, and to re-instal the monster of communal representation<sup>47</sup> which was banished from this land by the fathers of the Constitution.

B. Another demand of a minority community is that the Minority Commission, set up administratively, during the Desai regime, should be given a constitutional footing and a *binding force* to its recommendations.<sup>45</sup>

Apart from the fact that none of the various investigatory Commissions set up by the existing Constitution has got more than recommendatory status, the broad consideration against any such drastic proposal is that, if conceded, it would mean a government by the Minority Commission, resulting in the abdication of the government by the peoples' representatives voted to power. To quote the words of Sir Samuel Hoare, who rejected the suggestion that the recommendation of the Public Service Commission should be binding on the Government (see Chap. 30, ante)-

"The danger is that if you give them mandatory powers you then set up two governments."

Besides, what would happen if the members of the Minority Commission (which must necessarily be a collegiate body representing the various minority communities) fail to agree (as has already happened since one of the Members of an erstwhile Commission, Prof. John, in a reasoned discourse, exposed the blatantly unreasonable, anti-national and antimajority views and outlook of some of his colleagues)?48 When the Commission is divided, it is obvious that Government must have the discretion to find out which of its views is consonant with reason and national interests. Even when the Minority Commission speaks in one voice, it cannot claim an imperative command simply because it is not a body responsible to the people.

Besides, what should be the proper jurisdiction of the Minority Commission, what would happen to any recommendation of the Commission which is ultra vires or outside that jurisdiction and who will decide whether any of its recommendations is beyond its jurisdiction? Insurmountable confusion and chaos would result if, in spite of these considerations, binding force is given to the recommendations of the Minority Commission.

The only proper jurisdiction of any such Commission, under the existing Constitution, would be the matters included in Arts. 25-30.49

It is to be noted that Parliament has enacted the National Commission for Minorities Act on 17 May, 1992, but that its recommendations  $[s. 9(1)(c),$ (2)-(3)], have not been given any obligatory force. The Act defines "minority" as a community notified as such by the Central Government.<sup>50</sup>

C. Another demand advanced on behalf of the Muslims is that the Directive in Art. 44 for establishing "a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India" should not be applicable to the Muslims who should be allowed to be governed by the Shariat as their personal law.<sup>51</sup>

# HOW THE CONSTITUTION HAS WORKED **CHAP. 34]**

This demand, again, seeks to put the clock back. At the time when the Constitution was framed, all such claims were considered and rejected on the grounds that (a) matters like marriage, inheritance and the like falling under the category of 'personal law' are secular matters having no essential<br>relation to religion<sup>52</sup> and that (b) without a common civil code, inter alia, the people of India, belonging to heterogeneous elements, could never be united into a nation. The provision in Art. 44 is nothing but an implementation of the objective of 'fraternity, unity and integrity of the Nation' which is not only enshrined in the Preamble to the Constitution, but is since buttressed by the Fundamental Duties in Art. 51A(c), (e) [see  $Chap. 8$ .

It may be mentioned that when the Law Commission of India took up the question of framing a common code of marriage and divorce, not only the Muslims but the Christians too opposed the move and that the very government which had induced the Hindus to give up their scriptural laws relating to these matters, gave way to the Minority resistance, for 'political' reasons. Now that Art. 51A has been embodied in the Constitution, a constitutional lawyer might urge that any opposition to Art. 44 by any member of any minority community would be a violation of Art. 51A, and any Government which yields thereto would be a party to such violation of the Constitution.<sup>53</sup>

It is curious that while polygamy has been either abolished or controlled by Islamic States like Turkey and Bangladesh and is discouraged even in Pakistan, Indian Muslims are pressing to uphold it as their religious right, founded on the Shariat<sup>54</sup> and eventually protected as a fundamental right, by the Constitution of India.55

As against this, the Government of India, in 1986, undertook legislation<sup>55</sup> to supersede the law declared by the Supreme Court in *Shah* Bano's case<sup>56</sup> and deprived the Muslim women of the rights that they enjoyed in common with all other women. Such legislation retards the unity of the Nation as envisaged in the Preamble to the Constitution and at the same time, relegated India to a backward status even in the progressive Muslim world.

Notwithstanding all this, the Law Minister of the National Front Government is reported to have declared that a common Civil Code could be adopted 'only when the members of the minority communities demanded it'.<sup>57</sup> One wonders whether anybody has the authority to infuse these words into Art. 44 of the Constitution, without an amendment thereof. It would be useful to write on the walls of Parliament the text of Art. 44-

"The State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.

D. Once one particular community is permitted to urge anti-national demands, it is natural that other minority communities will start clamouring for other privileges which might serve their own sectional interests.<sup>53</sup> The claim of Harijans who have embraced Buddhism to be still treated as "Scheduled Castes" for being entitled to the special reservations for Scheduled Castes in Parts III and XVI notwithstanding conversion to a

religion other than Hinduism, may be cited as an instance (since conceded in 1990).<sup>53, 58</sup>

An impartial observer should wonder how such claim could be advanced by the Buddhist, Muslim or Christian converts in the face of the

Claim of Hindu converts to other religions.

history and meaning of the very expression 'Scheduled Castes'. It is, in the first instance to be recalled that this expression is not a coinage of the Constitution of Independent India, but had its origin

in Para 2 of the Scheduled Castes Order, 1936, which had been issued in pursuance of the direction in Para 26 of Sch. I of the Government of India Act, 1935—to determine the classes who were 'depressed classes' (called 'harijans' by Mahatma Gandhi). In this pre-Constitution Schedule Castes Order of 1936, it was categorically declared that *no* person who is an 'India originally have belonged to the list of Scheduled Castes prescribed by that Order. It does not appear that any Anglo-Indian or Buddhist ever protested against this provision of the Order of 1936.

The framers of the Constitution made two categories for favourable treatment-(a) Scheduled Castes, and (b) 'socially and educationally backward classes' even though they might not belong to any of the listed Scheduled Castes [Art. 15(4)]. The reason why the separate category of 'Scheduled Castes' was still maintained was that the caste system was prevalent only amongst Hindus and the Sikhs, owing to their social history, and it was this caste system which resulted in their degradation. Casteism is not professed by other religions, such as Christianity, Buddhism and Islam.<sup>53, 58</sup> That is particularly the reason why the makers of the Government of India Act, 1935 and the Orders thereunder did not entertain any reservation in favour of Hindu converts to those religions.

In the Scheduled Castes Order, 1950, which has been framed under the Constitution, it is, accordingly, laid down (para 3) that a person shall not be deemed to be a Scheduled Caste "if he professes a religion different from<br>the Hindu or Sikh religion". The validity of this exclusion was challenged by<br>persons converted to Buddhism under the auspices of Dr. Ambedkar, b was rejected by a unanimous decision of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court.<sup>58</sup> It is patent truth that the Hindus form the target of conversion by proselytising religions, such as Christianity, Islam or Buddhism. Their object is to overturn the aforesaid decision of the Supreme Court. If any Government entertains softness to concede the demands of the converts from Hinduism, they would be abettors of conversion from one religion to another and an act of aggression against the non-proselytising Hindu religion,—quite contrary to the guarantee of secularism in Art. 25 of<br>the Constitution.<sup>58</sup>

Of course, if any section of converts comes under the 'socially and educationally backward' classes,<sup>59</sup> they would still be entitled to the special privileges under Arts.  $15(4)$ ,  $16(4)$ . But that would be a different matter.<sup>58</sup>

The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Orders (Amendment) Act, 1990 has, however, extended the reservations to converts to Buddhism also. This
will further erode the unity of the nation. In fact, the Christian converts from Hinduism are agitating for similar reservation.<sup>60</sup>

The advocates of guaranteeing further minority rights in India, supplanting the existing Constitution, if necessary, pretend to overlook the following broad considerations which distinguish the status of minorities in India from the international problem of minorities in post-War Europe which have inspired the International movement for minority safeguards:

(a) In the international sphere, the demand for special safeguards to protect the cultural or linguistic identity of minority communities has emerged from the principle that owing to war or like No minority problem in India, in the circumstances causing territorial changes without the international<br>sense.<sup>61</sup> consent of the people residing in those territories, the identity of such communities who have been torn

asunder by circumstances beyond their control should be preserved from ethnic extinction, by affording proper safeguards through international Charters and national Constitutions.

The partition of India which left a portion of the Muslim community in India took place in the *opposite* way. The pre-independence demand of the Muslim community led by their acknowledged leader, Mr. Jinnah, was to have a separate homeland for the Muslims who, it was asserted, constituted a nation separate from the Hindus. The British Rulers conceded to this demand overruling the contention of the nationalist Indians that the Muslims and Hindus as well as the other people residing in India constituted one Nation and not two or more. The result of the acceptance of the two-nation theory was the lamentable partition of India and the creation of a separate Dominion, named Pakistan. As a sequel of such division, the Hindu leaders in India could have insisted upon an exchange of population between Pakistan and India, so that all the Muslims in undivided India could be transferred to Pakistan. But they did not prevent any Muslim from staying behind in India, as an Indian. Those who remained in India, did so of their free will and option. The partition was the seeking of their own community and not the result of any circumstances beyond their control, such as the First or Second World War which created the international minority problem in the world.

Of course, in consonance with the liberal attitude of the Hindu leaders, the framers of the Constitution of independent India embodied certain safeguards for minorities in like manner as the International Charters. But these safeguards were extended to all numerical minorities of all religions, languages and cultures and not to the Muslims in particular. The Muslims who opted not to go to Pakistan did so with their eyes open as to the safeguards they might get under the draft Constitution and not because of any covenant that they would be allowed to demand more and more to serve their sectional interests.

It is to be noted that the Universal Declaration did not contain any provision in respect of minorities so that the makers of the Indian Constitution had no international obligation to include in the Constitution of 1949 any special provisions to protect the minorities. Subsequent thereto, in 1966, the International Covenant was adopted, including Art. 27<sup>46</sup> as follows:

### INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA ICHAP. 34

"Article 27. In those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion, or to use their own language.'

Few people appreciate that these rights were anticipated by the makers of the Indian Constitution of 1949 and guaranteed them as the fundamental rights of the minorities in Arts. 25, 29, 30.

But to urge for *political* or other rights not provided for by the Constitution, would be not only unconstitutional but anti-national, because the makers of the Constitution wanted to build up one Nation, namely, Indian, in which persons belonging to the majority and the minority would embrace themselves into a Fraternity [Preamble]. To refuse to enter into the mainstream of Indian Fraternity on the plea of Muslim identity is nothing but a vestige of the two-Nation theory which the fathers of the Indian Constitution sought to banish once for all as a result of their bitter experience culminating in the lamentable Partition.<sup>47</sup> To reiterate: the advocates of the two-Nation theory went away to the 'homeland' for the Muslim community of their own choice. Some of them, however, stayed behind in India as their birth-place. After several decades of enjoying the special privileges of minorities under the Indian Constitution, they now refuse the embrace of Fraternity which the Preamble of that Constitution<br>accords and seek to demolish the 'integrity' of the Indian Nation, by<br>asserting that they are 'Muslim Indians'.

Pleading for them, one ex-Magistrate asserts that the Muslims remaining in India have made India "the largest Islamic nation in the world after Indonesia" [Article by Buch in the Statesman, dated 12-12-1990].<sup>61</sup>

(b) In the international sphere, it has been emphatically made clear<sup>62</sup> that the only object of offering the minority safeguards was to protect the minority from discrimination by the majority who administer a country under a representative system of democracy. But this is on the condition that the minority "must be loyal to the State of which they are nationals", 62 and must not set up an 'imperium in imperio' founded on their minority status.

The framers of the Indian Constitution, too, fondly believed that, having established a secular State (i.e., a State which has no established religion of its own, and treats all religions equally) and offered safeguards for the preservation of the religious, cultural and linguistic identity of the minorities,-not only Muslims, but all the minorities who remained in India as Indian citizens, would be united as one Nation by the bond of 'fraternity' (Preamble). But this the Muslim community, in particular, has refused to achieve. Their demand is not only to create a homeland<sup>63</sup> for Muslims within India in the same process as led to the creation of the separate State of Pakistan, but even to supplant it by an Islamic State,<sup>64</sup> if possible. Only the other day, a responsible Muslim dignitary is reported to have said-"We are Muslims first and Indians afterwards . . Muslim culture is the mainstream in India and others must join it."65 This is a resurrection of the two-Nation theory which led to the lamentable Partition of India which must be resisted by every nationalist Indian, irrespective of his party affiliation.

A student of the Indian Constitution can only wonder, with bewilderment, whether any such assertion runs a<br>foul of the following provisions of the Indian Constitution<sup>66</sup>—the Preamble; Art. 19(2), as amended by the 16th Constitution Amendment Act, 1963; Art. 51A(c),(e)<br>[duty to promote 'common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious. . . or sectional diversities'], and whether this was the desideratum for which the nationalists in India consented to give up a part of their motherland in order to gain independence.<sup>67</sup>

(c) I must, with profound regret, point out that there are Muslims, who are not even willing to call India their 'motherland', on Disrespect for the the ground that Bankim Chandra's Vande Mataram, Motherland.

which was adopted by the 1896-session of the Indian National Congress, seeks to deify the motherland, while any kind of imputation of personality to God smacks of idolatry, as condemned by Islam. On this point, the reader may at once refer to p. 18 of India, 1987, where the translation of the first stanza of this song (by Sri Aurobindo) has been reproduced. To express gratitude to the soil from which you sprang and which sustains you with milk and honey every moment of your life is not idolatry, simply because it is called 'mother'.<sup>68</sup> In fact, the country of one's origin can only be described either as 'fatherland' or as 'motherland'. Since some political leaders who are not themselves Muslims, sometimes fan communal sentiments only to gain political favours from the minority community, it would be worthwhile to reproduce relevant provisions from the Constitutions of Russia and China, both of which have a considerable Muslim population who are obliged to swear by these provisions, without demur.

Article 62 of the 1977 Constitution of the U.S.S.R. says-

"Defence of the Socialist Motherland is the sacred duty of every citizen of the USSR. Betrayal of the Motherland is the gravest of crimes against the people."

The 1993-Constitution of the Russian Federation says-

"Art. 59.1.-The protection of the *fatherland* is the duty and obligation of the Russian Federation.

Article 55 of the 1982-Constitution of the Chinese Republic repeats, in no less emphatic terms:

"It is the sacred duty of every citizen to defend the motherland and resist aggression."

It would be pertinent, in this context, to mention that the erstwhile ruling Party in Turkey was named the 'Motherland Party'.

Any sane man must concede that what is not anti-Islamic elsewhere cannot be anti-Islamic in India simply because the Muslim vote is covetable to every party which seeks to come to power.

The reason why the song *Vande Mataram* was adopted as complementary to the National Anthem Jana-Gana Mana may be explained in the words of the President of the Constituent Assembly, on the 24th January, 1950, which were adopted with applause:

"The composition consisting of the words and music known as Jana Gana Mana is the National Anthem of India, subject to such alterations in the words as the

### INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 34]

Government may authorise as occasion arises; and the song Vande Matram, which has played a historic part in the struggle for Indian freedom, shall be honoured equally with Jana Gana Mana and shall have equal status with it."

To resist the play of the tune of this song on the ground that it would impair communal harmony because it is an emblem of idolatry which is repugnant to Islam, is to forget the following facts:

(a) That it was sung in the 1896-session of the Indian National Congress, after omitting the larger part of the song which depicted the hands and limbs of the motherland (in order to obviate any objection from the Muslims) and retaining only some 20 words at the beginning of the song, for official use.

(b) That it is that trimmed composition which is printed at p. 18 of India, 1988-89, as the counterpart of the National Anthem.

(c) That the tune of that clipped composition that is played in the All India Radio and the T.V. at the beginning of each day's programme.

(d) That whatever might be the objection to particular words used in the latter portion of the song, the same cannot be raised as an objection to the music representating the earlier part of the composition, except by a handful of men who have forgotten that what they could do during the days of the Muslim League cannot be done today because of the partition of India intervening.

(e) That this music is an emblem not of communalism but of India's freedom.

(f) To protest against it today is to turn the table up-side down, taking recourse to religious fanaticism.<sup>69</sup>

There is little doubt that this country, inhabited by heterogeneous

Lack of national sentiment.

elements belonging to different races and religions, can maintain her independence, only if she stands as one man, inspired by a national sentiment. Every

American, whether of English, Hebrew, Italian or Negro origin, regards the United States as his motherland for which he must fight against dangers at home or abroad, and that is why she has maintained her independence as a mighty Nation, notwithstanding so much of difference in race, religion and culture amongst her variegated population. The situation in India is just to the contrary. As in other matters, in India, even constitutional and legal questions are muddled up with politics, which, of course, means power politics. Few leaders today think of the Nation (as did the members of the First National Congress of 1885), apart from the interests of the political parties to which they belong and through which machine they scramble their way to the seat of power. It is even risky for an impartial academician to express his conclusions derived from a non-political interpretation of the Constitution to which everybody in India must profess to swear allegiance. It is difficult to convince people engrossed in power politics that to love his motherland is the birthright of everyone born in this country and that it does not need to don any particular cap or to hoist the banner of any particular hue.

### HOW THE CONSTITUTION HAS WORKED **CHAP. 34]**

Those who believe that communal harmony and the unity of India can be achieved only by granting more and more extra-Constitutional privileges forget the adage-once an infant always an infant'; and also the fact that communalism is a vicious circle : the cry of 'Muslim in danger' gave birth to Hindu fundamentalism and, similarly, the slogan of 'Muslim sentiments' has given rise to the plea of 'Hindu sentiments'.<sup>70</sup> There will be no end to these pernicious currents or cross-currents so long as everybody is not told firmly that all of us, including the administrators, are bound by the Constitution<br>which we adopted as the 'People of India', (-) under which there is no room<br>for Hindu Indians or Muslim Indians, but there is only one Nation, nam Indian, which is solidly bound by a tie of fraternity. If we have any respect for the Constitution of India, we must tear off from the political history of India those baneful pages which have become anachronistic and stand in the way of our national unity even after the adoption of the Preamble to the Constitution of divided India.

Let me, in the present context, stray into a personal (but relevant) digression. As a schoolboy (not knowing anything about politics or communalism) I was attracted by the national songs which inspired the 'non-Co-operation' meetings and processions. One of the few that I still remember was-

## "Ekbar tora ma baliye dak jagata-janara sravana jurak Tris koti kanthe mayere dakile thas dik sukhe hasibe . . ."

It depicted India as our motherland and exhorted all the people, without any exception, to call her 'mother'. The Muslim leaders who participated in these meetings and processions never objected to this representation of one's birth-place as 'mother' nor did the Muslim masses ever imagine that 'Muslim sentiments' would be prejudiced thereby, just as a staunch Hindu did not object to the singing of another piece-

# "Ram Rahim no juda karo bhai, dilki sachha rakho ji ...,"

which exhorted the Hindus not to treat Ram and Rahim as different entities.

If today, more than half a century after independence, we are on the reverse gear, it is for the political parties to search their heart to find if they are in any way responsible for this great 'Fall' for which divided India shall have to lament through all futurity. It is no good throwing mud on each other. All of us have forgotten the history of our independence, the ideals of those who brought about that independence, and the Constitution which enshrines those ideals.

In fact, decline of national sentiments has generated obnoxious selfishness and greed, forgetting all the while that members of Parliament own the vote of the people on the shameless profession that they would serve the country. The result has been a fall of the ideal of Parliamentary democracy for which the Nationalists fought the crusade for independence. Few Parliamentarians today are duly cognizant of the basic provisions of the Constitution, the fundamental law of the land,-and the respect which it demands.

#### INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 34

The narrow-mindedness and selfishness of the 'representatives' of the people was shamefacedly illustrated when on the last Failure of Parliaday of sitting of the Ninth Lok Sabha, the M.P.s mentary democracy. unanimously voted for ensuring their pension, and at

an enhanced rate, even though the Lok Sabha was dissolved after a short duration,-without caring to see that a bill or motion having financial liability could not be introduced without the President's recommendation  $[Art. 117(1)$  of the Constitution].

A more fundamental cause of the trend towards the failure of Parliamentary democracy is that since the beginning of the present decade, violence and extermination of opponents is being resorted to as an easier mode of winning an election. The foundation of Parliamentary democracy is an 'appeal from the bullet to the ballot'.

Amidst this abysmal gloom, a ray of hope has been flashed by the fact that by the 61st Amendment Act 1988,-amending The new genera-Art. 326,—the voting age has been lowered from 21 to tion of young 18 years, as a result of which younger blood has been voters. infused into the electorate of India, since the

1989—General Election. The result has been that it would no longer lie in the mouth of the elders to keep students away from politics. What the students have so long been doing surreptiously in the educational institutions, they will now do it as a matter of right. Now, therefore, it will be a concern of every young man to be apprised of the objectives of each of the political parties and to decide which way he himself would be inclined. All this means degeneration of academic education, no doubt, but it will bring forth a new generation of students who would realise that they are not tools in the political machinery, to be wielded by political leaders to serve their selfish ends,—but the very foundation of Parliamentary democracy in India.

Of course, mere lowering of the voting age will not give a young man an opportunity to enter into the administration at once, so long as the qualifying age of membership of the Legislature is not lowered down from 25 years for the House of the People or the Legislative Assembly of a State. The period between 18 and 25 is the brewing time given to the younger generation to equip themselves for taking up the reins of government from professional politicians who have repeatedly proved their failure. Time has come for them to realise that they cannot reach their objective by political slogans or breaking their heads on the streets, but by acquiring political education and encyclopaedic knowledge ranging from nuclear science to agriculture and the mass of laws by which this vast country is governed,—so that they can usher in an age of efficient administration, if and when they come to power.

At an election held in the U.K. or the U.S.A., hardly a life is lost in the election campaign, during which opposing contestants address newsmen and the voters from the same platform,-presenting alternative programme to solve the same national problems, from which the electorate can make their choice for a new Government.

In India, on the other hand, it has become commonplace that when a political leader is determined to win an election at any cost he has to use younger people as tools in his election campaign of bloodshed. It is young people who either kill or are killed. At the General Election of Parliament held in November 1989, over 100 lives were lost in the election clashes and a similar figure is to be attributed to the State Assembly election in several States which took place in February, 1990. At the election for the 10th Lok Sabha held in 1991 the death toll has exceeded 289 (Present position is not available). Side by side was the open declaration of a Chief Minister that, whatever might be the result of a Poll, the issue of a certificate of the Returning Officer was under his control. This cannot be brushed aside as a hyperbole because it was attended with unlawful practices which led to unprecedented intervention by the Election Commission in some such States.

This is not Parliamentary democracy, but its death-knell. It will be a glorious failure of democracy in India if the younger generation does not cry a halt to this scheme of massacre. It is for them to rise as a man to protest against the nefarious mandates of the heads of various political parties.

Every Indian must look forward, to build up an India which will stand as a man against whatever calamity befalls our lot. The responsibility therefore lies on the younger generation to build up a united and stronger India, where each man will play the role of a poet, philosopher, warrior, and administrator, rolled in one, in the cause of the Motherland,—which stands paramount to the narrower interests of his family, community or political affiliation.

Before concluding, I should mention certain glaring events which have changed the background in the history of constitutional development in India.

So long there was one major Political Party, namely the Congress, while there were a number of groups or factions, composed of dissidents, apart from the Leftists Parties who held views radically different from the rest. The decline of Communism in Europe, including the U.S.S.R. itself, has made it impossible for the Leftist to present an alternative government at the Union level.<br>Instead has emerged the Bharatiya Janata Party (known as the B.J.P.), as an effective Opposition Party, with evident potentiality.

It seems that at future elections, the issue will be as to the meaning of 'Secularism' in the Indian Constitution. The case of the B.J.P. is that secularism means equal treatment of all the religions and not a favourable treatment (extra-constitutional) of the minority, or rather, the Muslims (who

constitute the major group amongst the minorities), in order to secure their votes, which is decisive because the majority, that is the Hindus, are divided into numerous Political Parties. According to the B.J.P.,

what the Ruling Parties have been doing so long is to pamper "Muslim sentiments", for which there is no provision in the Constitution over and above the safeguards embodied in Arts. 29, 30, and the like. The Constitution, on the other hand, promises equality to every individual, irrespective of religion [Arts. 15 and  $16$ ].<sup>71</sup> INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 34]

In the 1996 Lok Sabha Election, although B.J.P. got the highest number of seats, it could not attain absolute majority. It seems that at the next General elections the political parties would be compelled to fight the elections being divided mainly into two camps-(a) B.J.P. and (b) non-B.J.P. This did actually happen in 1996, but in a different manner-the anti-B.J.P. Parties united against the B.J.P., but without surrendering their separate entities. The result was formation of Coalition Governments formed by 13 minority parties, headed by Mr. H.D. Deve Gowda and later on by Mr. I.K. Gujral, which tottered ever since their formation and collapsed within a year of their formation. In 1998 Parliamentary elections, the B.J.P. emerged as a single largest party and again a coalition Government was formed headed by Mr. Atal Bihari Bajpayee with a political uncertainty to complete its full term.

Both at the elections held in 1989 and 1991 (for the 9th and 10th Lok

Unstable government and rule by a lacking Party majority.

Sabhas, respectively), the largest single Party has failed to secure an absolute majority; yet, in order to avoid another election, it was allowed to form a government with the tacit support of some other Parties who, however, refused to enter into a coalition government

and share the responsibilities of the Party in power. The result has been the successive fall of a minority government as soon as the supporting Party withdraws its support on some issue on which it has taken a contrary stand. This has happened to the governments headed by Mr. V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar.

On the other hand, a Muslim religious leader has urged the Muslims to thwart both the Congress(I) and B.J.P. by voting against both and forming a Government, if possible, by uniting with other divisive forces such as those who preach class hatred on the basis of casteism or poverty. The action of the Muslim religious leader is only the other side of the coin to mix up politics with religion; but it will require another Supreme Court decision to put it down for the sake of maintaining the *unity* and *integrity* of the Indian Nation.

Resort to Presidential system, no solution.

Some people think that since we have failed in the game of parliamentary democracy, we should now try our hand at the Presidential form of Government. Without going into the merits and demerits of the two systems, a jurist should point out that this will not be possible

because an amendment of the Constitution, which will be necessary for the purpose, will not be tolerated by the Supreme Court so long as the thirteen-Judge dogma that the Parliamentary system of Government is a 'basic feature' of our Constitution<sup>72</sup> is not turned down by a larger Bench,—which would be another Herculean task.

We have, therefore, to remain contended with the Parliamentary system.

Apart from this, unless corruption is rooted out from the grass roots, a change over to the Presidential system will merely result in the installation of irresponsibility and autocracy; wherefrom shall we get a 'clean' President and a nationally inspired electorate to keep him under control?
A cool thinking of all the foregoing considerations will enable us to realise that in order to save our democracy, each one of us should make a sincere and concerted effort to root out dishonesty and corruption, withdraw all support from 'political murders' and communal riots and should love our country as we love our mother. This can be achieved if only we realise the true tenets of our respective religions, for no religion teaches otherwise.

- 22. The present agitation, in fact, is not a new movement, but is a logical sequel of the 'Bangal Khedao' movement which started as a language drive, some three decades ago. It would be an eye-opener to many people in other parts of India, that one group of the agitators calls its movement as 'the 18th war of *independence*', to carve out a separate homeland for the Assamese who belong to the Mongolian stock, with a separate flag [Time, 7-3-1983].

30. The secessionist nature of the Gorkhaland agitation is veiled and equivocal and not so patent as in the case of that for *Khalistan*, and that is why the Government of India was initially misled to assume that the *Gorkhaland* agitation was not anti-national, until the Government of West Bengal came out with a well-documented White Paper (in two Parts) which gives written evidence of what the GNLF (Gorkha National Liberation Front) means, according to its 'President' Ghising.

The Gorkhaland agitation relates to the West Bengal District of Darjeeling where a Figure number of Nepalis reside as immigrants (for work), under a reciprocal treaty of<br>friendship between India and Nepal of 1950. The GNLF claim that Darjeeling was a part<br>of Nepal and came to the British Government by wa British acquired the territory by grant, agreement or annexation of which the other party was not Nepal but Sikkim or Bhutan, during the 19th Century. Nepal entered into the 1950 Agreement with India, because the immigrants to Darjeeling were people of Nepali<br>origin (*Gorkhas*) whereas many Indians were similarly residing in Nepal, so that<br>'reciprocal rights and privileges' were to interest to

The agitation for Gorkhaland took a concrete shape by the submission of a Memorandum by the GNLF leader to the King of Nepal on December 23, 1983 (Appendix A to the W.P., Part I). This contained clearly a demand for creati an treates and agreements which might stand in the way of severing Gorkhaand from<br>India. It also spoke of the 'right of *self-determination*' of the Gorkhas and copies of this<br>Memorandum were simultaneously sent to the hea from India.

As Appendix B to the W.P. (Part I) shows, on June 2, 1985, the GNLF leader made<br>a speech wherein he admitted that the Government of Nepal or the U.N. had not responded to his claim for a separate sovereign State. This speech was, in fact, made after the Government of India, realising its initial blunder, told the GNLF leader that there would be no talk with him until he gave up his claim for a sovereign State outside India.<br>In para 2 of this speech, therefore, the leader says that 'we do not want to get separated<br>from India...but have demanded ... separa British by way of cession from Nepal, and in the concluding paragraph he clearly urged<br>for a 'separate sovereign' State, just as other small countries had been recognised as<br>separate States by the U.N.

The Author had, in a previous edition suggested that if the Government of India does not create a separate State is would have to offer regional autonomy after its terms were settled by a tripartite talk between India, West Bengal and Gorkha leaders. This has come to be true. In July, 1988, an agreement was signed creating a Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, followed by election in pursuance thereof, and Subhas Ghising has been elected Chairman of the Council.

It is high time that the Union Government pays adequate attention to other separate movements which appear nascent for the time being, such as the 'Jharkhand' movement of tribals in West Bengal, Bihar and adjoining areas;

DALWAI, *Muslim Politics in Secular India*, (1972), quoted in the Author's *Commentary on the Constitution of India*, 6th Ed., Vol. D, pp. 220-21. The *modus operandi* of all such disruptive forces is to advance step by st and further extended, taking advantage of the fact that non-Muslim political parties vie<br>with each other in conceding such demands, in whole or in part, in order to secure<br>Muslim votes. That was how Pakistan was built up. Thus, while originally the demand was for communal representation in the Government Services, the Indian Muslim League has since 1979 extended the demand to such representation in the Public Sector Undertakings and technical establishments, the army and the police. Similarly, the demand for aid for the promotion of Urdu has come to be a demand that Urdu should be recognised as an Official Language under Art. 347 of the Constitution even in those States where the Urdu-speaking people do not form a *substantial* proportion of the population of the State concerned, such as West Bengal. The paradox of the situation is that while in Bangladesh, the Muslims themselves are fighting for the propagation of the Bengali-Janguage (in place of Urdu which the Pakistani military regime sought to inject into the Bengali-speaking population) the Muslims of West Bengal whose mother-tongue is Bengali are making conveyances, market places and the like, and also to represent at the time of census that their mother-tongue is Urdu. The next step is to demand that the Government Offices in West Bengal must have Urdu typewriters and typists, even though there may not be any official paper in Urdu to be typed. One has to rub his eyes to find that since March, 1985 this Urdu separatism has led to the demand that the Urdu speaking non-Bengali industrial areas of West Bengal should be given the status of 'Urdustan' [Ananda Bazar Patrika, 28-8-1985; Jugantar, 29-3-1985; 6-4-1985].

Those who have learnt a lesson from the Partition in India can hardly shut their eyes to what has happened in Kerala. During the United Front Ministry (1967-69), a separate Muslim majority district was formed, named Malappuram. In 1983, the United spanner matter and foremant, led by Congress(I) has conceded the demand for the formation of a second Muslim majority district with Kasargod as its headquarters

[Statesman, dt. 27-2-1983]. No less alarming is the utterance of a responsible Government dignitary that already there are pockets at places in West Bengal, like Asansol, Murshidabad, where Urdu-speaking Muslims form a maj Law can only point out that the Supreme Court has held that the question of minorities has to be determined with reference to the population of the *entire* State [In re Kerala Education Bill, AIR 1958 S.C. 956 (para 21)]. To say that the Muslims residing in a particular pocket constitute the majority is to majorise them within the pocket, while they continue to derive minority safeguards and benefits available to every Muslim in the State as a whole. To make light of this ominous trend is to pave the way for the next demand for the formation of a second Pakistan in such Muslim pockets in Kerala, West **Bengal** and other States

Anybody who assumes that to meet ever-aggressive demands of a religious minority is to foster 'secularism' should note that it would be the highest form of communalism to support one religion as against the majority who are to lead in a Parliamentary form of Government.

- It should be noted that so far as the linguistic interests of Minorities are concerned there is already a provision for the appointment of a Special Officer for linguistic minorities, in Art. 350B
- Parliament has enacted on 17 May, 1992, the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992 for constituting a statutory Commission. The Act defines "minority" as a community notified as such by the Central Government.

The functions assigned to the National Commission for Minorities are to (see s. 9)-

(a) evaluate the progress of the development of minorities under the Union and **States:** 

(b) monitor the working of the safeguards provided in the Constitution and in laws enacted by Parliament and the State Legislatures;

(c) make recommendations for the effective implementation of the safeguards for the protection of the interests of minorities by the Central Government or the State Governments;

(d) look into specific complaints regarding deprivation of rights and safeguards of the minorities and take up such matters with the appropriate authorities;

(e) cause studies to be undertaken into problems arising out of any discrimination against minorities and recommend measures for their removal;

(f) conduct studies, research and analysis on the issues relating to socio-economic and educational development of minorities;

**INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA**  $[CHAP. 34]$ 

(g) suggest appropriate measures in respect of any minority to be undertaken by the Central Government or the State Governments;

(h) make periodical or special reports to the Central Government on any matter pertaining to minorities and in particular difficulties confronted by them; and

(i) any other matter which may be referred to it by the Central Government.

- 51. The Jamiat-ulama-i-Hind goes to the extent of urging for the deletion of Art. 44 [Statesman, dt. 2-10-1979, p. 3] or to exempt Muslims from its operation [Statesman, 8-4-1985].
- This view has been supported by many Muslim Judges and scholars who possess special knowledge about the Shariat [see Author's *Commentary on the Constitution of India*, 6th 52. (Silver Jubilee) Ed., Vol. D, pp. 222-23].
- If Government yields to this demand of the Muslim now, could it resist a similar demand of the Christians and the nascent demand of the Akali leader that there should be a separate code of personal laws for the Sikhs [Statesman, 16-6-1983]. For similar demand<br>for Christian converts; which has been turned down by the Supreme Court, see *Soosai* v. Union of India, AIR 1986 S.C. 733 (para 8).

54. Ananda Bazar Patrika, dt. 5-2-1982.

A Muslim divorced wife brought an application for maintenance under s. 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which was decreed. The husband appealed to the Supreme Court on the ground that s. 125 should not apply to Muslims as it is contrary to Muslim Personal law. The Supreme Court rejected this contention upon the interpretation of s. 125, namely, that it applied to all 'persons', irrespective of their religion or personal law, and dismissed the husband's appeal.

In the judgment [Ahmed v. Shah Bano, AIR 1985 S.C. 945 (para 32)], the Supreme Court observed that it was a pity that the State had not made any attempt to make a common Civil Code even though Art. 44 issued a clear mandat behalf,-whether the lead came from the Muslim community or not:

"A belief seems to have gained ground that it is for the Muslim community to take a lead in the matter of reforms of their personal law. A common Civil Code will help the cause of national integration by removing disparate loyalties to laws which have conflicting ideologies ... It is the State which is charged with the duty of securing a uniform Civil Code for the citizens of the country. . ."

The Supreme Court repeated its views on Art. 44 in Jorden v. Chopra, AIR 1985 S.C. 935 (para 1).

As a learned Professor of the Bombay University, Prof. Siddiqui, observed, if the State took the lead, ultimately the Muslim community would accept it because it was in accord with the notions of modern civilised society;

"The issue should not be decided in terms of textual conformity with the Koran but in the context of modern civilised society. And then even if the law goes against the Koran, the Government must enact it. Ultimately, the community will accept it" [Sunday Observer, 6-5-1984].

Overriding the clear observations of the Supreme Court and rejecting the protests of a large section of the Muslim community, including learned scholars, however, the Congress(I) Government enacted the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1966, providing that the statutory provisions contained in this Act should govern,<br>andess the divorced woman and her former husband apply to the Court that they would<br>prefer to be governed by the provisions of s. 125, of the divorced wife.

The Congress (I) Government thus, gave way to the Muslim fundamentalists to violate the Supreme Court decisions as well as the Constitution, which enjoined the State to make a common Civil Code, overriding any personal law to the contrary. It was more surprising that the National Front Government's Law Minister had dittoed, declaring that there would be no common Civil Code unless the Muslim community wanted it.

The claim of the Buddhist converts, resurrected during the 1980 election, clearly confronts the unanimous decision of the highest tribunal in *Punjabrao* v. *Meshram*, AIR 1965 S.C. 1179, followed by *Ramalingam* v. *Abrah* 

Notwithstanding these decisions of the highest tribunal of the land and the irrefutable grounds stated at pp. 399-400, the National Front Government has enacted the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Orders [Amendment) Act, 1 extending the Scheduled Caste privileges to the Buddhist converts from Hinduism.

- Prime Minister Rao failed to achieve it through an ordinance. His successor Gowda 60. intended to have it through a Bill.
- 61. This statement of the Author has been criticised as an *'thse dixti'* by Mr. Noorani [*Statesman*, 27-6-1995]. Mr. Noorani has not repelled any of the reasons given by this Author at pp. 400ff. of the 16th Ed. of the sphere, the minority problem arose when the population of a country came to be directed against their will, by external circumstances, such as war, to another country so that the divided community which became a minority in another country needed safeguards to save them from ethnic extinction. On the other hand, the Muslims obtained the Partition of India on their own demand on the footing of the 'two-Nation' theory, and even after that Partition, a section of the Muslim community preferred to remain in India<br>out of their own choice; nobody compelled them to remain in *divided* India (which was a creation of theirs)

(ii) When they opted to remain in divided India, they did not enter into any covenant with the Government of divided India. No observation of Moulana Azad can be enforced as a legal covenant in an international court.

(iii) The leaders of divided India incorporated in their Draft Constitution certain safeguards for minorities, notwithstanding the Partition, because they refused to concede on principle, that the Muslims in India constitu constituted one Nation whose unity and integrity must be maintained was proclaimed in the very Preamble of the Draft Constitution of divided India. The Muslims who opted to remain in divided India did so with their eyes open to this Preamble and the safeguards for minorities included in that Draft.

These have ultimately been embodied in Arts. 25-30 of the Constitution as finally adopted in 1949. Hence, all the safeguards in Art. 27 of the International Covenant are already embodied in the Constitution of India, viz., the right (a) to enjoy their own culture [Arts. 29-30]; (b) to profess and practice their own religion [Art. 25(1)]; and (c) to use their own language [Art. 29(6)]. If any of these rights are infringed, any member of the minority community can legally enforce them in the national Courts under Art. 32 or 226

(iv) But the Muslims and their advocates are not contended with this. They want things beyond what is already contained in the Constitution adopted by the 'People of India' (which included the Muslims who opted to remain in India), e.g., to eliminate or scrap Art. 44 of the Constitution—which enjoins the Government of India to make a common civil code for all the people of India. The highest Tribunal of the land which is also to abide by Art. 44 (by reason of Art. 36), read with Art. 12, has been repeatedly reminding the Government of India of their duty to implement Art. 44, when more than half a century has elapsed since the adoption of the Constitution.

As against this, what covenant will a journalist produce before an international forum to establish the case of those who are still fostering the ghost of the 'two-Nation' theory, to disintegrate the unity of India, and to override the highest law of the land.

On this point, I can do no better than to quote from a recent Supreme Court judgment [Mudgal v. Union of India, AIR 1995 S.C. 1531 (para 35)].

"Those who preferred to remain in India after the Partition, fully knew that the Indian leaders did not believe in the two-nation or three nation theory and that in the Indian Republic there was to be only one Nation-the Indian Nation-and no community INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA [CHAP. 34]

could claim to remain a separate entity on the basis of religion." [See also Bommai v. Union of India, AIR 1994 S.C. 1918 (para 21)—9Judges.]

No dogmatism of a journalist, coloured by a communal vision, can demolish the foregoing observation of the highest tribunal which is founded on patent history.

(v) It is an amazing evidence of the foresight of the Indian leaders that even though the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was made some two decades later, they anticipated the contents of Art. 27 of the International Covenant and embodied them in the Draft Constitution. But that cannot confer on the Muslim Separatists any right to go further, against the undenied facts of Indian history [vide Poudyal v. Union of India, AIR 1993 S.C. 1804 (paras 30, 51) C.B.].

Of course, in some later stanzas, the motherland is described as having hands and voices, but that is nothing but a poetic way of portraying the hands and voices of all children of the soil, to whom the poet appealed for fighting for their independence, as one man. The object is not in any way different from the patriotic songs of other lands.
- 69. It sounds ironical to hear that the objection to *Vande Mataram*, which figured in the 11-point demands of Mr. Zinnah 1938, could be resounded through the mouth of the Muslims in the 1992-Parliament, *i.e.*, 45 years
